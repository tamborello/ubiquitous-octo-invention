BILL NEMES, a former. salesman for King Coffee: who is now
employed by Home Juice, ‘left’ -King Coffee of his own’ accord
about a year prior tothe time MIKE SIMON terminated his

employment at King Coffee.

Mr. KING reiterated that he knows of no person of
responsibility connected with the King Coffee Company. who
was addicted to gambling and, therefore, :doubted very much
