ADMINISTRATIVE
Las Vegas advised that a photo of STONE was

displayed to LV 228-C-TE on 10/19/66, by SA LEO A, STEVENS,
Informant advised he had never seen STONE, -CI. stated he

‘would assume that if STONE is in contact with DAIDONE, it

‘would be in connection with MAURICE DODSON's activities as
DAIDONE has never been anything but a runner for DODSON and

is not known to have ever handled any betting action in his
own behalf. Las Vegas advised Dallas would be informed if

any contact is established between DAIDONE and STONE as result
of informant contacts,

On 11/15/66, SA EARLE panty obtained record
information from Mrs, PAT ANDREWS, Supervisor, Southwestérn
Beil Telephone Company, Fort Worth, Texas.

As the Bureau is aware, subject is DL 275-C-TE
who was re-activated after he was interviewed on other matters
on 10/20/66, and Bureau was so advised by letter under the
information symbol caption. Subject still maintains the
same apartment as reportalin referenced report and he is
undoubtedly carrying on a limited bookmaking operation with
his partner WILLIAM PETRE, PETRE is a night manager at Denny's
Restaurant, Dallas, owned by STONE's wife, and one of the two
telephones in STONE's apar ‘in the name of PETRE as
previously reported, Wied Jcontacts in Dallas and Texas,
it is quite possible that he can get his line information from
any number of sources without going out of state. It was noted
in last toll check that he was in most frequent contact with
JAMES WINNINGHAM in Fort Worth area, who is a known bookie..and
under separate investigation.

DL 165-116

For the information of the Bureau,

formant DL 275-C-TE, By separate letter Bureau has been
furnished with summary of volume of information furnished by
DL 275-PC with request that he be reinstated as Top Echelon
Informant. During period s t report, the agent has
been in frequent touch wath Jang it has been observed
that on an almost daily basis he is at his place of business
He then goes home
and returns to the restaurant around 5 PM and stays until

9 to 10 PM when the night manager comes on duty. has
previously expressed his view during contacts as informant
that he is afraid to become involved in any extensive book-
making while his appeal is pending and feels that he will

lose the appeal anyway and will have to serve his sentence,
which is 60 days. DL 275-PC is the most reliable and
knowledgeable source Dallas has on gambling matters and is
the principal source on two LCN members in the Dallas area,

If STONE should again start making book, it is felt the Dallas
Office will be aware of it through informant contacts with him
and other checks with other informants and police sources, and
the case can be reopened should he again become active,

IRS, Dallas, advised

 

: The Phoenkx Office reported the following confidential
information by communication dated 12/14/66:

- On 12/7/66, JACK GRAHAM, Security Office, Mountain
States Telephone Company, advised that Phoenix number 279-1779
is listed to PATRICIA STONE TAYLOR, 4120 North 28th Street,
Phoenix. .

The Oklahoma City Office advised that on 12/7/66,
PAUL RIGGS, Manager, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company,
Vinita, Oklahoma, advised that AL 6-4690 is subscribed to by
the Sacred Heart. Academy, 318 North Scaper, Vinita, Oklahoma.

For the information of the Bureau, note that Subject
is also identical with DL 275-PC, formerly DL 275-C-TE. With
Bureau concurrence we are still maintaining contact with subject
as an informant, and he continues to furnish valuable information
and to be one of the best contacts on gambling matters in the
Dallas area. During contacts with subject as an informant, and
even before instant case was instituted, subject repeatedly stated
he would not obtain line information from out of state and
involve himself in an investigation by the FBI. Subject is
extremely bitter at IRS over the way his case was handled
and him personally, in particular, While it is possible br
him to get the line from out of state, since he has a number of
important contacts in Las Vegas and elsewhere, it is also true
that he has worked with several big gamblers in central Texas S
in the area of San Antonionand at Fort Worth and is known through
toll call checks to be in touch with them. AUSA TIMMINS in
discussing STONE's appeal before the Supreme Court stated he
doubted that IRS could make a case against STONE on the basis of
