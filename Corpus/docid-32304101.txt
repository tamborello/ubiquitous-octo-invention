HKMemjh ; .

On September 20, 1956. [ _—_ confidential OTHER
source whose identity must. be protected, personally advised i

ASAC H. K. MOSS as follows:

ne,[___| naa been by the residence of suspect
SHOULDERS at noon and early afternoon of September 20, 19583
that the conversation at the SHOULDERS residence rotated entirely
around the interview with SHOULDERS by ASAC H. K. MOSS on the
preceding day. . SHOULDERS commented as follows. The FBI was
trying to involve him in a criminal violation with respect to
a visit made by CLUBB to SHOULDERS' residence, but SHOULDERS
expressed confidence that the facts would not amount to a
violation, He speculated that if the FBI had a real good: case
even against hig: son, young LOU, the FBI would have proceeded
immediately by Commissioner's complaint and warrant rather than
via indictment; that the latter method is used only when the
case is essentially a weak one. He further commented that he
doubted if any action would be taken against himself for the
reason that news stories referred only to young LOU, and :
certainiy in view of all the press interest in SHOULDERS, himseif,
had there been any possibility of proceeding against SHOULDERS
the newspapers would so have been advised. He referred to
comments made by ASAC MOSS as to what would make SHOULDERS "taik",
and SHOULDERS claimed that. he implied that he had turned down a
$100,000 offer and when ASAC MOSS asked SHOULDERS to be a
Government witness against COSTELLO, SHOULDERS claimed to have
replied, "How can I when I. don't know anything?", It should be
noted this is contrary to the comment that SHOULDERS did actually
made to ASAC MOSS as related in the details of that interview
with SHOULDERS on September 19, 1958. SHOULDERS then referred
to the "bad luck" that has befallen all of those.who did get
the money, referring to the successful Federal Firearms Act
conviction of COSTELLO and the current severe heart illness.
of ROBERT BERNA - iIn-.generalities SHOULDERS said it
was his opinion that in some manner or other the Teamsters
Union was utilized as a vehicle to dispose of the missing
GREENLEASE money. Referring to the efforts of the FBI to indict
him on the CLUBB matter, SHOULDERS said that at one time young

‘LOU SHOULDERS wanted SHOULDERS to "shelter" CLUBB but "I warned

LOUIE that someday they'd get that S.0.B.. in a crack and he'd
talk", SILK was of the opinion that notwithstanding: SHOULDERS!
claim that he was not worried about these developments,. that
actually SHOULDERS was perturbed.
