MM 105-2856

 

MM 3142-PSI has known for many years. CASANUEVA explained
that he felt that his house might be searchedby the FBI

and he requested MM 3142-PSI who is employed in the con-
struction industry, to hold “these detonators for him until
BOSCH needed them. These detonators were turned over by

SA DAVIS to Mr. TOM BRODY, bomb expert, Crime Laboratory,
Dade County Public Safety Department, on 4/9/73, with the
request that they be deactivated and marked with secret
identification so that BRODY can later testify concerning
them if necessary. BRODY agreed to do so and on 4/11/73,
returned them to SA DAVIS, stating that each had been de-
activated so that no explosion could occur by anyone using
them, BRODY made photographs of each. On 4/12/73, Special
Employee JOHN BIRMINGHAM, in the presence of SA DAVIS, made
color photographs of these detonators. SA DAVIS also marked
each secretly for possible subsequent identification. On Thee
the same date, 4/12/73, they were returned to MM 3142-PSI i
who agreed to immediately notify this office in the event
CASANUEVA requests the detonators be returned to him. MM

 

 

. 3142-PSI agreed to delay the return of the detonators a

» sufficient length of time to enable Agents to discreetly

surveil the pick up and destination of CASANUEVA. U h

There appears to be little doubt but that CH,
who is probably the most notorious bomber in the State of
Florida, is planning to come again active in the field
of bombings. It also appears very unlikely that his targets
will be in Europe since his princi hate is the Federal
Government of the United States. ) YU

All Miami informants have en instructed to

. attempt to obtain further details concerning his plans

|
and operations. “|
;

SA DAVIS has warned RICARDO MORALES NAVARETTE
concerning the alleged threats made against him by BOSCH . :
and has also advised Officer RALPH AGUIRRE of the Miami _ . i
Police Department concerning the possibility of an attempt > : s
being made against the life of MORALES. MORALES hi pressed
confidence in his ability to take care of himself. Ww) :
