Mr. Davidson, who represents various foreign governments
and officials and who frequently in.the past has volunteered information to
Bureau, particularly data which might assist his own endeavors, telephoned
at 10:20 a.m. this morning (5/6/70) with regard to the matter set forth
below. By way of background, Davidson called Mr. Tolson's office 11/10/69
to advise he represents Foreign Minister Adam Malik of Indonesia and that
Malik desired to meet the Director. The Director's regrets were expressed
to Davidson since the Director's schedule did not permit this.

This morning Davidson said a responsible American told him one
Subandro, a minister in the present Government of Indonesia who in his --
opinion is a communist and who has been in jail, would be released in the
immediate future and would replace Adam Malik as Foreign Minister.
Davidson felt the life of Malik, who is now in Indonesia, might be in jeopardy.
He asked that Bureau evaluate this information and furnish it to appropriate
officials of our Government.

It was explained to Davidson that Bureau is not in a position to
evaluate this information and would in effect be merely acting as a transmission
belt for him. He acknowledged this to be the case and said he thought that this
was a function of FBI. It was carefully explained that this is not an FBI
function and that we do not evaluate intelligence data such as he was reporting.
He acknowlédged it was "raw" intelligence and he could not vouch for its

authenticity. a
