that a search of the Keg ond ss, her potel failed to “disclose

any record of a DELIAAWI/ Z=r, OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ, and
explained that most .6f the re drds°Of the hotel are destroyed
after one year, and that shé does not believe that the
records for the year 1958 are complete.

 
   

~ A check made at 127 Southwest 9th Street, Miami,
Florida, on January 18, 1962, reflected that there is no
longer a house located at that address,that it has been
razed and replaced by a parking lot and commercial estab-
lishment, and inquiry in the neighborhood failed to disclose
anyone who has any information concerning the occupants

of that address in 1958. PSI MACHADO advised that

although OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ apparently has moved. from her
former address located at Calixto Garcia(#71) Regla, Cuba,

.-some of her relatives still teside there, and have knowledge

of the present residence address of OLGA DIAZ: She may be
reached at telephone number 90-61-633, Havana.

“PSI MACHADO and psIL________] both of whom -
have known the family of OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ and her sister,
DELIA, for over 20 years, are convinced that OLGA DIAZ
SUAREZ is serious in her at t and seek poli-
tical asylum in the U.S.A. stated although
OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ was formerly pro-CASTRO, she has become
disillusioned with the regime of FIDEL CASTRO, inasmuch as
the regime is communist, Both sources advised that OLGA
DIAZ SUAREZ is not active in the almost non-existent
underground in Cuba, and that she has chosen not to be
active in order to avoid having the attention of the
Cuban authorities attracted to her activities.

Inasmuch as the Bureau can be of little or no
direct assistance to OLGA DIAZ SUAREZ in her defection,
it is to cs.) that the Bureau consider referring this

matter to CIA. (Y).

UACB, the Miami Office is not taking any further
action in instant matter.
