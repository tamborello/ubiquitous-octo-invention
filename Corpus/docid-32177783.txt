YURIY NOSENKO

   
   

Yuriyf/NOSENKO-spent much of his career in the Sixth
Department of e KGB's Second Chief Directorate (SCD), which was
responsible for tourists. He spent only a short time of his
career in the First Department, SCD, which was responsible for

American officials at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

NOSENKO had excellent family connections because his
father was Minister for the Shipbuilding Industry in the USSR.
That is- how NOSENKO managed to become a security officer for the
Soviet delegation which traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, for arms
control talks. He defected to the United States from this
position.

The SCD was quite pleased when U.S. intelligence began
to believe NOSENKO was not a bona fide defector. They were
particularly pleased when he was harshly interrogated by the CIA.

According to the source, NOSENKO was not sent to the
United States to be a false defector. The source said that it is
against KGB policy to send an intelligence officer as a false
defector. Also, the KGB would never have selected him for such a
mission because his father is a high-level Party official.

The source doubts that NOSENKO ever saw OSWALD's file.
According to the source, NOSENKO was not higher than a Captain or
Major when he defected to the United States. The source believes
that NOSENKO may have tried to show himself more valuable to the
CIA than he really was. At the time of his defection, NOSENKO

was mixing in high circles of Moscow golden youth. The source
believes he defected for material gain.

SECRET

According to the source, [each one of these oteicers YU)
told him that the KGB did not handle Oswald after his redefectién
to the United States, and the KGB did not give any tasks to

OSWALD. They also said that the KGB never gave OSWALD a task to
kill President Kennedy.

 

 

The source said that rumors in the West suggesting the
KGB was involved in KENNEDY's assassination were absurd.
According to the source, the KGB would never risk the scandal of
assassinating a major world leader.

DEBRIEFER'S COMMENTS:

 

Needless to say, we will go back over his knowledge of
OSWALD in an effort to acquire any additional information.

_LEE HARVEYAOSWALD_AND WIFE MARINA ysic~

 

The source discussed the Lee Harvey OSWALD case with

Corner instructors at the Minsk KGB Higher School of

Counterintelligence. (u)

Following his defection to the USSR, OSWALD was
resettled in Minsk, outside of Moscow. He was placed under full
surveillance by the regional or territorial KGB in Minsk. KGB
officers from the Second Directorate of the White Russian KGB
were in contact with Oswald and considered him an agent because
he would provide them with some information on his past. Marina
was also considered an agent.

Oswald resided very close to Victory Square and the KGB
Higher School in Minsk. His apartment was very nice by Soviet
standards.

Oswald was also interrogated several times by KGB
officers in Moscow. The source does not know what type of
information OSWALD provided to the KGB in Minsk or Moscow.

OSWALD fell into deep depression in the USSR. He was
homesick and wanted to return to the United States. He
eventually received Soviet permission to return to the United
States with his wife Marina.

His KGB handlers did consider passing OSWALD to the
First Chief Directorate to be handled by a KGB residency in the
United States. This proposal was ultimately rejected, however,
because OSWALD was considered too unstable. According to the
source, the KGB did not handle OSWALD in the United States and
had no further contacts with him.

Marina was considered an agent, but she did not like to
cooperate with the KGB. She was interested in OSWALD, but even
more interested in getting away from the Soviet Union and
poverty.

we KGB instructors who told the source about OSWALD
were (Coldne

nro

1 Torchuk, Colonel Sluzer, and Colonel Schlobochekov. C&)

These individuals used to be members of the White Russian KGB.
SCD officers Aleksey, YEGOROV and Leonid GOLUBOVSKIY jalso told him
about this operation The stories were all consistent.
