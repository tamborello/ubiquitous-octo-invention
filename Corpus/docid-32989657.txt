critical of FBI) AT 40h bad

Reference is made té the memorandum from Mr. Rosen to :
Mr. Belmont, 11/20/62 (copy attached), referring to the article
of Rey. Martin Luther King, Jr., criticizing the work of the FBI
in reiation to the Albany situation. The question has been raised
as to whether we should not try to talk to King and set him straight
as to the Bureau's approach and activities. pete t hgh patted

et eu
At the outset, it should be stated that it #s enestionabie ~ &
whether an interview with King will be fruitful. /We have picked up
information in the past that King—admits—to—being-a-—Harsist,_but.
cannot afford.to..adnit-thts-publiely.. We knqw of his close tie-in

with Hunter Pitts Odell, a member of the National Committee of the
Communist Party, and we have,seen yarious instances where King received
advice and his actions were apparently controlled,at least to some
extent, by the Communist Party. or

On the other hand, we do Enow that King has been in semi —
with the Attorney General from time to time, and in view of the
public image he has built up as a Negro leader he may fancy himself
as a leader using the assistance of, but independent of, the Communist
Party.

(1) Mr. DeLoach feels that it would be desirable to interview
King. He recommends that he and Assistant Director Sullivan jointly
interview King. He feels that two Bureau representatives should
interview King in order that there will be a witness and there can
be.no charge of provincialism inasmuch as DeLoach comes from the
South ‘and Mr. Sullivan comes from the North. °

(2) Mr. Sullivan feels that King should be intervieved. He
féels, however, that if two Bureau representatives approach King, King
will be immediately on the defensive and no progress will be made.

He feels that King should be interviewed, initially, on a broad basis,

showing the Bureau's understanding of the racial and sociological
problems of the Negro, and thereafter the Bureau's position should
be built into this frame of reference. He believes that either

Mr. DeLoach or himself should undertake the interview, individually.

(3) Mr. Sullivan suggests A third alternative. He is very ~
well acquainted with Dr. Douglas Jackson, a well Rnown cocholociet (White
and a member of the faculty*of Southern Methodist University in .
Dallas. Dr. Jackson is known to Sullivan as a man thoroughly and
soundly interested in solving the racial question in the South. He

.is well known in different Negro areas for. the stand that he has taken
and he is respected by them. Additionally, Dr. Jackson has been quite
interested in the work of the Southern Christian Leadership Caénference,
of which King is president.

Jackson has told Sullivan, as recently ds a week and a half
ago in Indianapolis, that if he at any time can do anything which
would assist the FBI he should simply make the request of him. Sullivan
believes we should also give consideration to having Dr. Jackson
approach King and discuss this whole matter with him very thoroughly,
from a racial and sociological point of view, and ultimately clarify
in this discussion King's ideas on the FBI, and lay the groundwork
for King's support of the FBI. Sullivan would-be perfectly willing
to brief Jackson on this entire matter and set the machinery in
motion, if it is do desired.

RECOMMENDATION :
The above three courses of action are set forth for the
Director's consideration. I personally favor #

To obtain authorization for high level dissemination ;

Enclosed is a document captioned as above, which

can depicts communist influence in the civil rights field, Vv i
ee emphasizing the key role of Martin Luther King, dr. This 4 ae
document is a current revision of the previous analysis . Leas
, captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement - A Current: Analys? 5, a

we have emphasized these areas: (1) continued reliance of King
upon former Communist Party, USA, members , particularly Stanley \,*
David Levison; (2) facts relating to King’s moral degeneracy;,. - ae
| and (3) communist goal of uniting the peace and civil rights. .
movements and King's adherence to this communist iong-range L
objective.

PURPOSE:

 

  

King‘s strong criticism and condemnation of the
\Administration’s policy on Vietnam in a speech he made at New York
on 4/4/67 shows how much he has been influenced by communist
\ advisors. His speech was a direct parallel of the communist
| position on Vietnam.

 

It is felt that the President would be interested in
a summary on King which shows the degree of communist influence
on him. The attached paper constitutes a complete picture and
strong indictment of King in that regard. -

RECOMMENDATIONS :
It is recommended that

3 (1) The attached letters, with enclosures, to the
White House and the Attorney General be forwarded to Assistant
to the Director Deloach for transmittal to Mrs. Mildred Stegalts -y

vo the White House, and the Attorney General. bea “ a
