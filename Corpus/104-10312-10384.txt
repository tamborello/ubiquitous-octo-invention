MEMORANDUM FOR: DCD/0SG/0SB
ATTENTION «Graig Hale -
SUBJECT : Gordon Michael Dwane Novel
REFERENCE: HH+27696, 10 December 1975

1. I have reviewed the allegations in reference that the
British, either British military or British intelligence (other-
wise not further specified), have outfitted a converted World
War II Liberty ship as a floating display case for BritisK
military hardware. I have further checked out the bizarre story
in paragraphs two and three of reference concerning use of the
British ship by MI-6.

(2. This office has absolutely no information to substantiate | 7
the story told in reference and Africa Division also has no wwe
corroborating information.

3. In short, I consider the story developed in paragraphs
two‘and three of reference highly suspect since I do not believe
the British would be able to mount such an operation without it
coming to the attention of this office.
