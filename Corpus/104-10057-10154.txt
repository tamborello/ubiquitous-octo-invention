that DDO is referring the entire matter to the FBI and State
“Department.

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent
wartiations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HEMMING. a

7. From the name, physical description, activity, and
silleged employment, it is apparent that Gerald Patrick HEMMING
is identical with the subject of Office of Security file:

429 229, who has been described as six-foot five, 250 pounds,
“who is a notorious mercenary and soldier of fortune and who as
‘of May 1975 was ostensibly employed by a private investigation
company, TEPCOL Security (Office of Security--no record) in
‘Miami, Florida. ; .

 

 
 

8. Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,

‘the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JMWAVE, On
add ee BUD occas lois, Sait at ease tne early 1560° Ds HeeTTOeen wu
iad claimed Agency affiliation when in fact there has beoa _
snone. The most. recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such
affiliation was.-in.May 1975S when he volunteered his services
“to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Gerald Patrick HEMMING
is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SFH353 459),-

* aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a

- long-time record ‘of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. _In
the late 1950's. HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fidel.CASTRO: in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter
‘claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thereafter,
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and ;
Central American activities which he named the International =
Anti-Communist Brigade, A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
(the backers of ‘whom have never been fully established} was :
named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

 

 

9. For: an: appreciation of the possible ramifications of

.a Guatemalan. government. expose of this assassination plot |
“involving HENMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
smemorandun, to wit: -a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June ;
1975 in the name of. Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;
vand an extract. fron a book published in early 1976 written by
‘Michael CANFIELD and\Alan J. WEBERMAN. The book Coup d'etat
mn America--The’ CIA and the Assassination of John F. ‘Kennedy .
a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to “to link the A Agency
“with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the major
‘links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

Jr. to Frank STURGIS: to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
“HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-
“mental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967— when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim" . .
“GARRISON alleged. that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
-Force), was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
sand that members of this unit were connected with CIA. GARRISON
hortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and :
canother cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISON's investigation. -
