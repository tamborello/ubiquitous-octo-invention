1. The vocational rehabilitation Phase of the ANBUD medical
program ended on 30 June 1966 with the completion of courses by the
~ Yvemalning trainees.. The activity, established in April 1964 by
arrangement with the Florida State Division of Vocational Rehabili~

tation, has reduced: the number of oes cases from 69

 
   
      
 
       
    

 

to six. One of the ‘remaining cases, is
-.&-Garcia Lines case funded by Headquarcers; These Six menarepresent
‘difficult medical problems whose disposition will be the subject of

& Separate report,

 

 
 
 
     
  

2. The original 69 cases classified.as unemployable because
of medical disability were referred to the AMBUD vocational reha~
bilitation activity as a means of terminating WOFACT responsibility
for their. continued support. Initial processing of the 69 referrals
resulted in ‘S88 active participants of which 35 were ultimately re-~
turned to employment, Twenty-three were dropped during evaluation
or training for many reasons including lack of interest, excessive
absenteeism, inability to learn, emotional instability, severity of
handicap, relocation, or confinement in.an institution, However,
some of the marginal cases in this group -were given partial training
and/or a routine of work which resulted in acquiring sufficient
motivation to solve their own work problems,
