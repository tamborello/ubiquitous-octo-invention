Ypsilanti to a "meet" with her numbers "stop" there to "balance
the tapes", Informant revealed that MARY GARIS makes a long
telephone call to Ypsilanti. each day in order to get the "numbers
phone action". and later she makes a very short telephone cali to
Ypsilanti not enly to furnish the winning numbers for the day

but also to furnish the “ine~and-outs”, the tabulations, for the
day.

In regards to the numbers, Informant advised that
“numbers kids" have to be at work in an office at 2:30 p.m.
six days a week. He said that their work day runs till about
7:00 p.m.. each night or later, at least until the number is
official for the day. Informant said that a “numbers kid is
kind of a strange breed in that he has kidded himself into be=
lieving that he gets prestige from his job = he is "in the
-rackets" yet “he's clean". The "numbers kid" is “blinded by a
$50,00 bill." If he works for a good house he gets $100.00 a
week plus’ a monthly bonus which can range between $250 and $500.
depending. upon the month's "take". At Christmas time he usually
gets a present from his numbers house which may be an amount
equal to a bonus plus a pay. This is all in addition to his
weekly salary and may bring his monthly pay to around $700.00
or more. Imformant stated that this is pretty good money for a
"numbers kid", ie, the "workers" on the street and in the
numbers offices, and, when put with the money he can make
"hustling" on the street, the "numbers kid" can get by fairly
well. Informant emphasized that one of the big features in this
type of job is that the numbers guy doesn’t pay any income tax
on this numbers money.

Lounge at 235 Bagley .Ave., which was formerly known as. the Motor

City Bar. He revealed that MOCERI runs a taxi-dance hall upstairs

that he is planning to consolidate the two car lots and. open ene
big lot on Livernois Ave. Informant stated that MOCERI lives on
London Ave. just off Livernois and near Curtis Ave. .He claimed
that MOCERI is either a cousin or nephew of PETE LICAVOLI. He

operating a past-posting scheme. Informant advised that ROY is an
_ “American guy" ie, not Italian, who is an old-timer from boot~-
legging days. He said that ROY is of German or Irish descent
and has been married 48 years. Informant advised that ROY (LNU)
lives at 2935 Chalmers and has telephone number VA 4-7504. (It
_ is noted that this telephone and address are both listed to one
ETHEL Cc. MORROW) . :

Informant advised that NICK DITTA is able to get "off-and-
runing service" daily from some guy he telephones in Connecticut.
He said that this.Connecticut guy charges DITTA $22.00 for the.
"off-and-running service" for the first race and $10.00 per race
that day thereafter. He stated that DITTA calls the Connecticut
number daily and he must pay the same amount each day for any
race he desires. Informant continued that ROY. (LNU) is a "sweet~
looking old guy" and all they need to complete: the past-posting
swindle is a bookie who is "not too smart with the horses", -In-
formant said that he had lined up a guy named JOE NAGEL who lives
on 3ist Street in Detroit between the expressway and W. Warren,
He said that JOE NAGEL is "a guy who has his nose open" to "make
a quick buck" and that NAGEL “books” horses and numbers and alse.
runs a pretty big “cut" poker game in his basement. Informant
said: that he recently got real friendly with. WAGHi, whom he des~.
cribes as a "stone. idiot", and subsequently introduced NAGEL to
ROY (LNU). He stated that ROY (LNU) told NAGEL that he has
$250.00 a day " clean" horse action and soon ROY was “turning in"
his "action" to NAGEL. Informant remarked that, to show how
dumb NAGEL is “with the horses", NAGEL pays ROY (LNU) 10% of his
"action" daily, which in this case would be $25.00. Informant
remarked that $25.00.a day for $256.06 a day "action" is way
out.of proportion: to: the usual "run-out". He, emphasized that
the combination of DITTA's "off-and-running race wire service",
ROY's (LNU) "angelic" appearance aud $2cu. horse action, and JOE
NAGEL's stupidity with the horses make for perfect ingredients
to their swindle. -

. Informant advised that ROY (LNU) “turned in” his "action"
to NAGEL for two days.and on the third day, yesterday, they
"beat". NAGEL for $2200.00. Informant said that DITTA gets. the
"“off-and=-running service" on the first race and ROY and Informant
have their appointment to "turn in" to NAGEL at. 1:30 p.m. DITTA

ROY “palms” DITTA's “fat ticket" and puts it in with the :
rest of the daily “action” and in this way they are "beating" :
NAGEL blind. Informant said that NICK DITTA told him that he

has been "going" with this past-posting scheme for twenty .

MITCHELL RAHHAL and, in a recent conversation about RAHHAL, AHEE
remarked "there's only one thing wrong with my cousin, MITCHELL.

- out" suits and coats and "making a pretty good buck" at it. He
‘related that DITTA has been confiding in him of recent "torch jobs"

_ "torched" the Rainbow Recreation, including the bowling alley, bar
md-restaurant. Informant said that DITTA told him he took
DE ANGELO along on. this job as DE ANGELO really needed the money.

Informant advised that DITTA bragged: about the "job" he did |
‘on: Rainbow Recreation. He said that DITTA told him that in all
of his "burn jobs" he attempts to "cave the joint in" and that he
does this by burning from the top and the bottom simultaneously
_which creates a blast and causes a tremendous inferno in the center
of the building. Informant said that DITTA was very pleased with
himself on the “burn job" of Rainbow Recreation but that he con=-
siders a "torching" a real success if one or more of the walls of
the building caves in ‘because of this "blast" of fire at the
Imilding's center. . Informant stated that the Rainbow Recreation
"score" came to him from MIKE RUBINO, and that RUBINO was. previously
given the "terch score" by. SAM BAGNASCO, Informant said that DITTA
told him that RUBINO called him in on this "burn job" although
WBINO had it in mind actually.te rob (FNU) STEFANI after STEFANI
collected his insurance: money. .He related that.the Rainbow Recrea=
tion fire was reported to. be a $200,000.00 tetal loss and that the
previous week .(FNU) STEFANI. collected a $132,000.00 check from the
insurance company.:..Informant said that: RUBINO'’s: hopes. to "beat"
STEFANI out. of some, .or.all, of his insurance money in a B&E
ef STEFANI's home: was thwarted apparently as (FNU) STEFANI
immediately deposited the $132,000.00 in the bank. Informant ad=
vised that DITTA was bragging to him that he and PETE DE ANGELO
were given the keys to Rainbow. Recreation by (FNU) STEFANI, the
owner of the place, and that they spent only eleven minutes inside
the building "setting up" the "burn job". Informant said that
DITTA uses polyethelene bottles filled with gasoline on top of

of the building, "fuses" them all together and "blows".the joint
"into the middle" of’ the building. Informant ‘stated that DITTA
blew the Rainbow Recreation on the night of October 5, 1962.

Informant advised that DITTA is. quite a talker. and he
e Joys "cutting up jack pots", ie., rehashing his old "scores".
He.: ‘stated. that-DITTA evidenced his. intense dislike for. LEO .
5 a. deceased, hoodlum who iwas killed in gangland fashion
- @lose. friend of Informants. He advised
; a a Siva Stick-up{6f a Newport Kentucky, gambling
club a number. of ‘years ago. ‘which he. (DITTA) went on with LEO
DI FATTA, "BIFFO" MACCAGNONE, MIKE. TRUPIANO, aka MIKE TRIPP,
PHILLIPPO ‘MONSEDDA. and JOE MOCERI wherein MIKE. TRIPP was killed
in a gun battle they had with the racketeers who ran the club.
Informant.said -that DITTA,:.who was. the first man to go in the»
club, claimed that the reason MIKE’ TRIPP. died was because, as soon
as the shooting broke out, and all the ‘Detroit mob, including
; DITTA, was. armed, LEO DI FATTA "“6ot yellow" and ran and hid in
the men’s room. He stated that to this day, DITTA blames LEO
DI FATTA for MIKE TREPTANO!s death:in the Newport gambling club
"heist"... :

 
 
 
 

Informant advised ‘further that NICK DITTA, though he is ~

close to many of. the Detroit Italian syndicate’ members, he ‘is

~ actually an outcast of "the outfit". Informant explained that
"DITTA does his own thinking". - He said that, for example, when
DITTA hears: something he deesn't feel that he is obliged, like
all other syndicate members, to immediately run to the nearest
phone and:call their superiors in "the outfit". Informant ad-.
vised that all..“workers":in the.syndicate have orders to. report
immediately to their "boss" any bit of information.coming.to their
attention regarding their duties or activities, legal and
illegal, engaged in by themselves or individuals in whom their -
“boss" might be interested... One of their prime: “orders".is to
report ang contact by a police officer, local.or Federal, which
they might have had, including all details of.their interview,
immediately following. the interview. Informant stated that in
this way "the people" keep abreast of the current activities not
only of their. own "workers" but other hoodlums in Detroit and also,
more importantly, keep their "workers" in a state of subservience
to the syndicate.

Informant advised that he is "in partners" with NICK:

DITTA on a real good "horse swindle". He. said that the last three
days he, DITTA, and a-70 year old guy named ROY (LNU) have been
