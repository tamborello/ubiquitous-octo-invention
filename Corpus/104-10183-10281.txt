MEMORANDUM FOR: C/®H/POA
ATTENTION : Cd 3
SUBJECT 3s Identi-Kit

Going over the various debriefing reports on AMMUG-1,
it would appear that the defector has an excellent memory
and a faculty for being able to describe physical character-
istics of many persons he has met but without being able to
remember their names. Two cases in point are the ‘ella
and the Tiberon.’ It occurs to us that possibly thought
should be given to using the Identi-Kit as a means of getting
a pictorial description of persons whose nanes the arent
does not recall but whose descriptions are still with his.
