Appraisal of ¢ ke 3

 

: 1. Contrary to the reports which are issued by the Cuban Goverment, the
5 , financial status of the Cuban economy ie rapidly deteriorating and
i bveconing a serious problem. During July 1959 an advisor to Prime
i Minister Fidel CASTRO Rua, warned him to proceed nore alowly with the

agrarian reform, because the Cuban treasury was running short of funds. oye a
. It was pointed out that 57 sygar mills were bankrupt and had not paid -
“* . "the plantation owners for the 1959 sugar crop. CASTRO waa told that
if the reckless confiscation of agricultural properties ecatinued, the
Cuban Goverment would become obligated to assume even more debts in
order to alleviate the hunger of farm vorkera.l

 

2. Another drain va the economy is goverment subsidies. For example,
the danoo de Desarrollo Economico y Social (BANDES, Social and
Economie Development Bank) coutrols about U.S. $400 nillion in
properties ani investments such as the Compafiia Cubana de Aviacion
(Cuban Airline Company). The companies have been caught in the
presont contraction of capital and cannot survive without government
subsidies, The subsidies paid by BAIDES amount to U. S. $8 million
a month, and this is only one exemple of the many payments which are
draining tne Cuban ‘treasury .2 : .-

Eleld Copments.

1. Frea-the-~reports-which-have-been-reeoived {t appears that there 1a :
gruwing- unemployment of farm vorkers. This is the "dead season*-— i
the period between sugar cene harvests—-but it is reported that a _ :
most plantation. owners and ranchera are fearful of confiscation of
: their properties for the agrarian-reform program)/and consequantly ;
: are doing very little in the way of maintenance work. The latter . ‘
i Provided tan are & marginal field of employment}, and this is now nr
denied to the agricultural workers, Bewever, spite of this
warring; Vie dgrarian-reform program has not been alowed. In
fact, it seems to have been intensified.

ae The source thought that nothing could stop CASTRO Jn his detemination : : 1

co te proceed with the agrarian -refora progran es fast as possible. Since i
the bigsest obstacle to carrying out this Frogram is the lack of money, i
the ‘houree was of the opinion that CAST) would do anything to obtain. {
this money aal might even confiscate bank accounts and moneys and nego-
tiable irstrusents held in safety deposit boxes. Carrying this one

step furthar, the yource thought such coufliscatory tactica could only |

be a teaporary saving device and that eventually it would be necessary s : i
for CASTIO te obtain a large lean fro: another country. fie speculated ae
that this weald nean either the United States or the Soviet Union, and . :
feared that if it were the lattery/it would mean the end of friendly i
‘selations with the United States. Ina respect to CASTRO's possible 2 ff

need for a loan, another, fairly reliable, source reported on 18 August
1959 thet CASTRO was trying to obtain a 3)»000,000-peso loan from lees
banks. , : Calms
