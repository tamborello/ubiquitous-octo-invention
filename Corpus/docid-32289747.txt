; _ It would appear that PETE's reference to SLIM
is to GUS ALEX and his reference to FRANKIE is to FRANKIE
FERRARO:

. -It would also appear from the conversation that
ALEX and FERRARO have some jurisdiction over TORNBENE and
ARGER. . From CG 6232-C it is known that ALEX and FERRARO
have sanctioned TORNBENE's and ARGER's activities in

the loop and without their approval ARGER and TORNBENE
could not continue to operate as they do. This information
has been reported in the past. ke

CG 6343-C* reported on January 18, 1960, that
on that date SAM GIANCANA and MURRAY HUMPHREYS, Chicago
Top Hoodlums had a conversation. HUMPHREYS made the
following comment: . ‘ :

"You know, ‘the older I-get, the better I get.
You guys better not put me on the (obscene) farm".

GIANCANA laughed at that remark.
HUMPHREYS. continued:

"What with GUSSIE saying that they're gonna: put
him on the (obscene) farm, you better keep me around," .

HUMPHREYS reference to GUSSIE is obviously
to GUSSIE ALEX and it would appear that in view of ALEX's
deteriorating health, ALEX is considering retiring from
the Chicago Crime ‘Syndicate, at least to some extent.

On the same date HUMPHREYS had a conversation with
FRANK FERRARO concerning MIKE BRODKIN, well known Chicago
criminal lawyer with offices at 188 West Randolph. In ~-
this regard FERRARO made the following comment: .

 

"That. money hungry. MIKE, GUSSIE is the guy who
controls him on the price", °

y Later on this same date BRODKIN had a conversation
with FERRARO and HUMPHREYS, HUMPHREYS and FERRARO were angry

, IV. INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM CG 6232-C

CG 6232-C advised SA WILLIAM A. MEINCKE on
December 23, 1959 that he had recently learned that
GUS ALEX is absorbing a lot of "heat" from his associates
regarding the recent publicity linking himself and "Strongy"
of the Normandy Lounge which had been, up until all of
the publicity, one of ALEX's prime meeting places and
a place where he conducted a lot. of his business tran-
sactions. He advised that the newspaper publicity linking
ALEX to LOUIS BRIATTA regarding the recent city payroll
scandal further caused ALEX embarrassment.

‘Regarding the old Viaduct Lounge, the informant .
advised that there was an individual known only to him as
RAMMIE who was described as white, male, slim, Italian,

160 pounds, 5'8", well built, well dressed, residing on

the southside in the vicinity of 3lst and Wentworth. He
advised that RAMMIE was a front man for GUS ALEX in

the huge crap game operated at the Viaduct Lounge. He:
advised that since the activity at the Viaduct Lounge RAMMIE
has fallen out of favor with ALEX and is no. longer on the
payroll. Informant advised that RAMMIE gambled extensively
himself and when ALEX found out about it he got rid of.

him immediately. The informant advised that ALEX did

not consider the offense too serious and possibly again ;
RAMMIE would act in ALEX's behalf at.a later date in other
gambling operations,

{nformant advised that he recently learned that
one JIMMY CONTRUSI is becoming more and more prominent among
southside hoodiums. The informant advised that since RODI
died, his son-in-law "SKID" CARUSO controls all the books and
gambling on the southside which was formerly operated by
his father-in-law. The informant advised, however, that
CARUSO is not near the man that RODI was. He is slow
moving and not a quick thinker and as a result other hoodlums
are moving in for power in his area. Informant advised that
JIMMY CONTRUSI is one who collects money from all the bookies
in the immediate southside area, He is supposed to turn
all of this money. over to CARUSO who in turn brings the good
portion of it to GUS ALEX, Inasmuch as "SKID" CARUSO is not

JOHNSON advised that MARIANNE ALEX stayed in the {
JOHNSON residence on the South Side of Chicago on three
recént occasions, this being on weekends of December 19, 1959
and January 16, 1960 and overnight on January 20, 1960.
JOHNSON advised that this is a most unusual thing for
MARIANNE ALEX to. do for the reason heretofore, ALEX
almost néver allowed his wife to be away from him. JOHNSON
opined that the reason for MARIANNE's' overnight visits
with them on these occasions was that ALEX was not in town
at least on’ these particular occasions,

JOHNSON advised that he is reasonably sure that
the ALEXes have not traveled to Europe this year as has
‘been their practice in recent years. The JOHNSONs were.
in Europe during the entire months of October and November,
and JOHNSON advised that they received at least one letter
postmarked Chicago from MARIANNE RYAN during that time.
JOHNSON also noticed that MARIANNE AKEX handled the business
ventures which are carried on jointly by. her and CAROLE
JOHNSON during the motths of October and November. JOHNSON
is. also aware of the fact that in late September GUS ALEX
. was arrested in California on a traffic warrant. He advised
\ that ALEX was extremely upset over this occurrence and
: that his health deteriorated as a result of it. JOHNSON
further advised that when MARIANNE ALEX spent the weekend
during December 19, 1959, he took her to the airport where
she boarded a plane for Los Angeles for the purpose of
visiting her mother in Glendale, California, where she was
to remain for the holidays. . .

Based on the above information, JOHNSON is reasonably
certain that MARIANNE ALEX at least has been in this country ‘
from the period during late September to the present time, i

On January 25, 1960, NY 2427-C, advised SA EDMUND
FLANAGAN of the New York Office that GUS ALEX, whom the :
informant knows as a well known gambler from Chicago and
who utilizes the nickname of "SLIM"',was in New York City 5
during the weekend of January 23-24, 1960, where he was Lo
staying at the St. Regis. Hotel under his wife’ sS maiden name,
MARIANNE RYAN. :

According to NY 2427-C, ALEX has been out of the
Chicago area since the shooting of ROGER TOUBY, who was
murdered in gangland fashion on December 16, 1959. The
informant added that he had heard that ALEX."had been
hiding out in New Jersey" since the shooting of TOUHY.

Il, STATUS OF HEALTH

‘It is apparent from the information which will
be reported hereinafter in the cover pages of this report
under the caption "Information Received From CG 6343-C*"
that ALEX has been in very poor physical health during
the recent several months. .It is noted particularly that
MURRAY HUMPHREYS in a recent conversation with SAM GIANCANA
spoke concerning the fact that "he is better than ever
during the past few years" and concerning the fact that
he does not intend to be retire@d by the Chicago Crime.
‘Syndicate. HUMPHREYS and’ GIANCANA are Chicago Top Hoodlums.
In this connection he commented that "GUSSIE says they're
gonna put him on the farm", It. would appear that what
HUMPHREYS was referring to was undoubtedly referring to
ALEX and to his. recent poor health.. It would also appear |
that it is very possible that ALEX is retiring from Crime
Syndicate activities. As corroboration of this presumption,
it is noted that when CG 6343-C* was established in July of :
1959, it was expected that this informant would be able to i
follow very closely, activities of ALEX due to the fact that ae
it was ALEX who most frequently of all the Chicago Top
Hoodlums appeared where his activities would be followed
by the informant. It would appear that the reason that
this has not been true is due to the fact that ALEX has
been sick, as evidenced by his two visits to the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and has not taken anywhere
near the active position which he assumed in the Chicago
Crime Syndicate up until the last eight or nine months.

 

Questions concerning the health of GUS ALEX
were put to GEORGE JOHNSON, above. JOHNSON advised that
inasmuch as heis not in contact with GUS and only knows
of ALEX through his close friendship with ALEX's wife,
he is not in a position to furnish current information
concerning the status of ALEX's health, however, he does
know that MARIANNE ALEX has been very concerned concerning

\ the health of ALEX in the recent past but is of the opinion
