Memorandum to Mr. Belmont
ROLANDO ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS : \
22-1622

RE:

Masferrer once had a barracks-type house in Miami where some

of his supporters resided. In early January, 1961, some of these
persons were arrested by the Miami Police Department for vagrancy and
others were ordered to leave. On 1-20-61 Masferrer advised Bureau
Agents he had been ordered by the police to give up the house since his
supporters had become a general nuisance and created disturbances in

Miami.

An informant who has furnished reliable information in the past

reported on 12-30-60 that Masferrer is broke and it is unknown if, or
when, he will get financial support from any Cuban or American group.

DIRECTOR'S CONFERENCE WITH ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL YEAGLEY ON
1-5-61 RE PROSECUTION

 

Masferrer case. After receiving our detailed reports, Yeagley
thought the Department had a case which it could present to a Grand
Jury; however, due to the break in diplomatic relations with Cuba,
the preséntation of such a case to a Grand Jury would be a delicate
matter. Mr. Yeagley had received a call from State Department as to
what Justice planned to do on the case, and Yeagley believed, when he
called State back, that he should get confirmation from State that
Justice should go ahead with the case despite the break in diplomatic
relations. The Director agreed that this was a wise thing to do.

' The Director pointed out to Mr. Yeagley that with the present state
of. public opinion, the Department was inviting great trouble if
it proceeded against Masferrer. The Director further pointed out

Mr. Yeagley contacted the Director on 1-5-61 to discuss the

 

that since all sympathy in the Miami area is‘with anti-Castro forces,
it seemed that if any move was made it ought to be at the specific
request in writing of the State Department. Mr. Yeagley thought these
suggestions were excellent and would advise the Bureau of the final
outcome of the matter after conferring with State.

CURRENT STATUS

i

On 1-6-61 Mr. Yeagley telephonically advised Mr. Belmont

he had talked with Thomas Mann of State Department and Mann had
advised it would be helpful to State's position if Masferrer's
activities were stopped and State had no objection to the presentation
of this case to a Grand Jury. Yeagley told Mann that Justice was

not anxious to proceed against Masferrer without a request in writing
from State.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont
RE: ROLANDO ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS
2-1622

 

Oy

On January 25, Mr. Yeagley advised that several discussions
had been held with Eric Heger, Legal Advisor of the State Department,
the last one being on January 19. Heger offered to furnish a letter
to Justice saying that State Department had no objection to prosecution
being instituted on Masferrer, However, Yeagley wanted a more positive
statement such as that it would be in the national interest to do so.
Yeagley said that Heger has now left the State Department and no
further word has been heard from the State Department and consequently
the Justice Department contemplates no further action as to Masferrer
unless and until the State Department sets forth its position definitely
in writing.
