the Mexican Embassy in Tegucigalpa was the source of these rumors.
these instences,(Colonel Gallegos jirew the conclusion that the ae
Government, through its diplomatic agencies, is interested in creating a
stete of confusion in this country. ®)

It may be mentioned parenthetically that the ohly group
