Secret. This document contains background information
concerning captioned individual.

 

As enclosed LHM indicates, Organization ZERO was.

in Miami in 1974. Since that time, so many ZERO letters have -
been sent and received by Cuban exiles in Miami, that local
Pokkice authorities and established informants are unable to
guess if there really was such an organization,

However, since TORRIENTE! s death, there has not
been a murder claimed by or attributed to ZERO, although

and criminal figures murdered since 1974. ;

Miami has spent. considerable time and effort
investigating Organization ZERO and has concluded that the
organization never did ‘exist and if it ever did exist, it.»
did only one operation, that is.the murder of TORRIENTE.
