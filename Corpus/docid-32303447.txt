the subscriber will make an official complaint. The

Philadelphia Division could be informed of this complaint.
When the phone would need servicing, it is believed this
would present a suitable pretext to exchange complete

instruments whereby a misur could be installed utilizing
the extra wires presently terminating in the telephone

instrument. !

It is requested that the Electronics Section advise
the Philadelphia Division if they could alter a pay phone
in such a fashion that it would not be obvious to a telephone
company employee who might later service this phone. For
information, it is to be noted that iftthe above is technically
feasible, the installation will have to be made under pretext
by sound trained Agent. Accordingly, complete instructions
as to the method of making the installation would be needed.
The Philadelphia Division believes they can obtain a public
phone for the Bureau to alter in the event the alteration
is possible.

The above is to obtain technical advice from the
Laboratory and in the event it is proven to be feasible
technically, the Philadelphia Division will submit appropriate
request for the Bureau to make this installation. It should
be noted that ANGELO BRUNO is a member of the Criminal Commission i
and has national prominence and this possible source would be
extremely valuable particularly since the loss of the partial
potential off PH 623-C*.

Sound Agents have an appointment for noon Friday
with telephone company contact to pursue the above-described —
situation. In the event the Laboratory desires that specific “|
information be obtained Fromuthis telephone company contact, i
it is requested that they notify the Philadelphia Division ‘
prior to date of the appointment. '

ACTIVATED UNLESS IT 18 BEING MONITORED AND CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE
ACTIVATED WHEN TELEPHONE PERSONNEL ARE WORKING ON THE TARGET INSTRUMENT.

THE SPMT OFFERS ANOTHER POSSIBLE INSTALLATION TECHNIQUE. IT WILL

BE NECESSARY FOR YOU TO FURNISH THE LABORATORY THE INSTRUMENT You
PROPOSE TO INSTALL TOGETHER WITH THE TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE CENTRAL
OFFICE SWITCHING USED ON THE SUBSCRIBER'S LINE. THE INSTRUMENT WILL
BE ALTERED AND RETURNED TO YOU ALONG WITH DETAILS FOR INSTALLATION.

If 18 NOT QUITE CLEAR, FROM THE REFERENCED AIRTEL, HOW YOU EXPECT
THE MICROPHONE, LOCATED ON THE BACK WALL OF A RESTAURANT, TO COVER AN
ADJOINING ROOM. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT, UNLESS YOUR SOUND-TRAINED AGENTS
HAVE FREE ACCESS. T0 THE TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT LONG ENOUGH 70 DIRECT THE
MICROPHONE TOWARD THE TARGET ROOM, SOUNDS IN THE RESTAURANT WILL OVER~-
REDE THE SOUNDS ORIGINATING IN THE TARGET ROOM.

YOUR SOUND-TRAINED AGENTS SHOULD CONSIDER THESE POINTS IN
EVALUATING THE- POTENTIAL COVERAGE IN THIS CASE.

NOTE: Philadelphia Sound-trained Agents have appointment with

telephone company informants at noon Friday, to discuss gaining .
access to the target area. Therefore, this should be sent by

urgent teletype to give Agents time to review and study Laboratory's
views before the appointment. ~

Philadelphia proposes to install a microphone in a pay telephone
jocated in a luncheonette operated by Frank "Sunffy" Iannarella, a
member of La Causa Nostra. Angelo Bruno and.other racket figures hold
meetings in a back room of IANNARELLA's luncheonette. If installation

\ appears possible, Philadelphia will request authorization to install.

7 FRANK "SNUFFY” IANNARELLA operates a luncheonette
“at 742 Christian Streét, Philadelphia, Pa. IANNARELLA is
known to be a member of La Causa Nostra. ANGELO BRUNO is
known to be his superior in La Causa’ Nostra. ANGELO BRUNO's
-chief lieutenant, PHILIP TESTA, is known to frequent this |
luncheonette apparently in connection with the operation. of
ANGELO BRUNO's numbers racket. Since PH 623-C* has host -
part: of its’ potential as previously explained to the: ‘Bureau ,
ANGELO: BRUNO and other racket figures hold meetings at 72
Christian Street, Philadelphia.

742 Christian Street has a public telephone on thee”
rear wall of the luncheonette. Behind this wall is a

small room where BRUNO has recently held a series of meetings.
Through contact with the telephone company at the time the
public telephone was installed at 742 Christian Street, - an
extra pair of wires was run and terminate inside ‘of ‘the
telephone instrument. These wires are presentiy unconnected.

Philadelphia is considering the technical
feasibility as follows:

Through contacts with the telephone company™it —
has been ascertained that the company could cause the-public
telephone to not return money deposited in the event that
a number called gives a busy signal. It is believed that “a
