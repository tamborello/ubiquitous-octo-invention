Late Friday afternoon and through the night a large: tiovement

of troops began here, They were sent to take up positions
and reinforce strategic positions around Havana and the northern
coast of the island because of the assassination of’ President
KENNEDY. Saturday evening FIDEL CASTRO appeared on television
and spoke about the death of KENNEDY and tried to refute ‘charges
which had already appeared in‘:the United States that the: ‘assassin
was a Marxist and a Communist Castroite, Although it: was only
the third time that I had witnessed a speech by FIDEL, I! got the
immediate impression that on this occasion he was frightened, if
not terrified. Other chiefs of mission, however, confirmed that
impression and indicated surprise at this hasty jump into

the arena to denouce insinuations which were merely from

news and nongovernmental agencies; In fact, it is the general
opinion in diplomatic circles that CASTRO feared‘that the
assassination would be the spring which would unleash ‘passions
and violent and blind hysteria of the American people against
Cuba and Russia and providé the excuse which up to now! was
lacking to justify intermationally an invasioy of Cuba, There
is talk again about the’coincidence of rumors: concerning a
crisis at the end of, ,the year (my letter . i

FIDEL, matical and: uneasy, tried through the same
telegrams of the’ ‘Ametican news agencies to refute the accusa-
tions which were then appearing and ‘to twist them.so ‘that the
assassination’:would appear as the work of the Ultra’ Reaction,
of the® extrém Yacists of the Pentszgon,, who are fanatical
supporters of war against Cuba and : ‘the Soviet Medon./=

. “He . (B. val sketched) ‘the life of LEE OSWALD and showed
with ‘these telegrams. that after his trip to ‘Russia OSWALD
seemed to be sipported by forces of the Right and that even
counterrevolutionary circles suspected that he was an: agent
of the CIAcor the FBI. : This’ caused CASTRO to. wonder whether
the assassin was not the mere instrument of a monstrous plot
of American militarists who, by eliminating KENNEDY, would
put JOHNSON in a postion from which there -would: be only one----~-—------ -
way out: to drain off anti- Cuba:: _hystetia by an action of

declared war. . .

 

 

Be that as it may, CASTRO tried to- bring forward aay
possible formal accusations against Cuba, clamoring that all
people should demand that the death of KENNEDY should be.
clarified and harping on the theme that KENNEDY. was being
ferociously attacked because of his weak policy against Guba
and Russia and therefore, his death could not be the’ work,
of Leftists, since it would only benefit the intentions. of the
Ultra Reaction and the Rightists. TUSCOIOTE\O)OND)

. b (iii)

I must inform you that the assassination did not cause
a great deal of consternation in counterrevolutimary circles
in the interior, disillusioned as they were with the.’
"weakness" of KENNEDY, especially after! his speech’ in Miami,
from which they expected measures or decisions t6 intervene
in Cuba which would presage the forthcoming end of the
COnmULSt regime of FIDEL CASTRO, .
