Discussion concerning Legat's role
and functions in Bragilia appeared to be routine, with few,
2£ any, pointed questions directed at FBI operations
overseas. The subject of two paid confidential sources in
Brasilia was briefly discussed and both SSC investigators
appeared understanding and in agreement with the necessity
of each confidential source to serve FBE's and U. S.
Government's best interests in Brazil. ‘The question _
seeningly bearing the most weight during the interview
concerned possible unauthorized activities of CIA and its
lack of cooperation and coordination with FBI and the
Defense Attache's Office. The duration of the interviow
was approximately forty-five minutes.(s)

SSC Staff Members on September 26, 1975. Again Aaron
