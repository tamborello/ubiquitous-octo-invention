Re: (U) 62-HQ-1029205, 06/12/1997

The status of informants and sources, if found through research,
is noted after the name as Living (L), Deceased (D), Date of
Birth (mm/dd/yy), or No Record (NR).

(U) The FBI provided written justifications presenting
the evidence available to protect the individuals, singular
information, and classified information related to sources and
foreign relations as listed above. However, the ARRB supports
the position that the information ordered disclosed is relevant
and significant to the assassination. They opine the pertinence
and importance to the assassination outweigh any current harm to
the individuals or the FBI’s/United States Government’s foreign
relations, informants or operational aspects. ~

; (U) The JFKTF will continue to advise CID, NSD and oGC
of the ARRB decisions. However, due to the narrowed scope of
appeal issues, NSD and CID recommendations will only be sought
for significant matters, none of which are documented in this
memorandum. If you have questions, please contact Barbara. L.
Hatch at extension 9482, Carol L. Keeley at extension 9494, or
Carl Valentine at extension 9476.
