BU 92-61

On 6/4/63, Corporal CAL BEACOCK, National Criminal
Intelligence Unit, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, advised
that the names of WALLACE and GEORGETTE GROSS are unfamiliar
to him, He suggested that the information relating bo WALLACE
GROSS (PH) could refer to a Toronto lawyer known as “WALLY”
ROSE who has defended leading Toronto racketeers in the past
and has had considerable contacts with them, Corporal BEACOCK
added that it is only logical that "WALLY" ROSE is acquainted
with and has had dealings with CHESLER, He also said that
ROSE has a number of girl friends, one of which may well be | Qo
known as GEORGETTE, He pointed out he has received informa-
tion recently to the effect that WALLY ROSE visited the
Bahama Islands, reportedly for the purpose of obtaining an
interest in gambling casinos in the Islands.

Based upon information furnished by BU 82-C* at
Buffalo and PH 591~C*, STEVE MAGADDINO of Niagara Falis, New
York, and ANGELO BRUNO have been approached about financing
part of the cost of construction and operation of the proposed
gambling casino, Members of the "Magaddino family" have
discussed the details of this gambling venture with JACK E,
GELLMAN, an attorney in Niagara Falls, New York, particularly
about obtaining mortgages, interest payments and the market
value of stock of Consolidated Bowling Corporation,

As previously reported, CHESLER and GELLMAN are
large stockholders and the original promoters of Consolidated
Bowling Corporation,

It is also noted that PASQUALE NATARELLI, a leading
figure in the Treasury Balance lotteries in Western New York
explained to subject's son-in-law, VINCENT A, SCRO, that the
employment restructions of the Exemption Certificate did not
prohibit them from placing pit bosses or supervisors of their .
own choosing in the gambling casino, i

According to highly placed informants, SAMUEL G,
RANGATORE, JR, went to Philadelphia to discuss this gambling
venture with ANGELO BRUNO on 5/26/63, While in Philadelphia,
RANGATORE met with BRUNO, FELIX JOHN DE TULLIO, NICK PICCOLO
and ALFREDO (LNU) at Lyndy's Luncheonette, After RANGATORE
