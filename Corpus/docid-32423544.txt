In'the course of questioning by Lt. Smith, Dan Rowan
advised that within an hour of discussing the wiretapping of
his phone with Phyllis McGuire of the McGuire Sisters Trio,
he received a call from the “bosses" whom he would not identify
who told him that under no circumstances was he to press
charges against Balletti or try to determine why his conver-
sations were being recorded and that if he did they would
see that he was ruined professionally. Lt. Smith asked Rowan
if Sam Giancana, the Chicago hoodlum, who was known to have
kept company with Phyllis McGuire in the recent past might
have wanted to know what conversations Rowan and McGuire were
having. Rowan replied, "How did you know about that?" and
stated, "You certainly could have the answer." On November 1,
1960, Rowan appeared at the Clark County Sheriff's Office and
signed a release, stating that he desired that all charges
against Balletti be dropped and that no action be taken by
the Clark County Sheriff's Office with regard to the
burglary and the intrusion of privacy by use of a listening
device, stating that Balletti was only working for someone
else.

Request for Investigation

 

By memorandum dated December 5, 1960, the Criminal Division
requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct a full
investigation, noting that the facts set forth in the report
referred to above indicated a violation of the provisions of
47 U.S.C. §605, and a conspiracy by Arthur James Balletti,

Fred T. Harris, and possibly Investigations, Inc., Edward

investigator who had requested the assistance of DuBois, According
to Balletti, at the Miami International Airport he met an in-
dividual he identified as J. W. Harrison from a description
previously given him and they flew together to Las Vegas.
Balletti advised that while in Las Vegas he physically sur-
veilled Dan Rowan and that Harrison apparently put some sort
of wiretap in Rowan's room there and monitored Rowan's phone
conversations and that he, Balletti, had nothing to do with the
tap, did not see it installed and never did any monitoring.
Balletti denied that he was accompanied to Las Vegas by one
Fred T. Harris, stating that Harrison had used a ticket in the
name of Harris and, for this reason, the police in Las Vegas
apparently assumed Harrison was Harris. According to Balletti,
Harrison left Las Vegas before Balletti was arrested on
October 31, 1960. Balletti said he could not comment upon
the electronic equipment found in his room.

An FBI investigative report dated December 22, 1960,
at Los Angeles, reflects that on December 21, 1960, Dan Rowan
furnished a signed statement to special agents of the Bureau
at Los Angeles, California. According to Rowan, after originally
signing a complaint against Balletti, he discussed the phone
tapping incident with Harvey Silbert and Elias Atoll, members of
the corporation which operates the Riviera Hotel and he, Rowan,
decided that pressing charges against Balletti would inconvenience
him. On November 1, 1960 at the Sheriff's Office, Rowan signed a
release and dropped charges against Balletti. Rowan advised that he

Results of Bureau Investigation Conducted
at Criminal Division Request

By a report dated December 23, 1960, at Miami, captioned,
“Arthur James Balletti; J. W. Harrison Unauthorized Publication
and Use of Communications," a Special Agent of the Bureau
advised that Edward L. DuBois, Jr., was interviewed on
December 13, 1960, in Miami, Florida, at which time he stated
that he had handled certain matters for a Robert Maheu, who

‘operates a private investigation organization in Washington,
D.C. DuBois stated that on October 25, 1960, he received a
telephone call from Maheu's principal assistant, one Walter
Fitzpatrick, requesting him to send two men to Las Vegas,
Nevada right away for physical surveillance work. Maheu
subsequently instructed DuBois to send only one man to
Las Vegas and advised DuBois that he had hired one
g. W. Harrison to accompany whomever DuBois sent. DuBois
advised that he sent Balletti to Las Vegas on October 26,
1960. DuBois next heard from Balletti when Balletti phoned
stating that he had been arrested in Las Vegas as a result of
a wiretap and DuBois added that Balletti had been hired
strictly for a physical surveillance.

The above-mentioned report dated December 23, 1960,
reflects that on December 13, 1960, Arthur James Balletti was
interviewed in Miami, concerning his activities in Las Vegas,
Nevada. Balletti stated that he would discuss his activities
with great reluctance and that it was very probable that he
would refuse to answer many questions. Balletti advised that
on October 26, 1960 he had flown from Miami, Florida to Las

_,, Vegas ;on a physical surveillance assignment on the orders of
WH UBMs employer, Edward L. DuBois, and that it was his under-

jeanding that he was actually working for some other private

(Wiretapping)
The following consists of a summary of the Bureau's
investigation and the results of their investigation into

the wiretapping of Dan Rowan's phone in his hotel room at

the Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada, in October 1960.

 

The Bureau's initial investigative report dated November 10,
1960, reflects the ‘results of an interview with Lt. Carl Smith
of the Detective Bureau, Clark County Sheriff's Office on
November 1, 1960, involving the arrest of Arthur Baletti on
October 31, 1960 for bugging the telephone box in Dan Rowan's
hotel room. A search of Balletti's hotel room reflected
notes and notations which Balletti had written down dates
and times on which he had recorded portions of Rowan's
telephone conversations. A black suitcase in Balletti's
room was opened and it contained a large quantity of
electronic devices, including transmitters, receivers, wall
plugs, a minifon wire recorder and a set of 17 professional-
type lock picks. On his arrival at the Clark County Sheriff's
Office, Balletti admitted that he had been hired by Investiga-
tions Incorporated of Miami, Florida, a company owned by
former FBI Agent Edward DuBois, and that this company
apparently had a client who had requested an investigation
concerning Rowan's private life. Balletti admitted listening
to and recording Rowan's telephone conversations since
October 26, 1960. According to Balletti, one Fred T. Harris,
an investigator from Miami, had entered Rowan's room and
installed the listening device.
