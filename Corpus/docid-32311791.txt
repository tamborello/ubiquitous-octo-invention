Two Yiddish speaking leftist organizations meet
at the YMHA, 401 South Broad Street. These organizations
are comprised of elderly Jewish people whose relative -
importance is diminishing as members die and are not replace
by new recruits. In view of the liberal Jewish tradition
represented by an organization, such as the YMHA, it is
questionable whether a counterintelligence offensive
directed at YMHA officials for the purpose of having

contracts for meeting rooms cancelled out would warrant
the time and effort involved.

‘ As the Bureau is aware, Boslover Hall has been |
the site utilized by the Philadelphia Social Science Forum
Committee (PSSFC) for meetings during the 1963-1964 Series.

In addition, a bazaar sponsored by "The Advocates" (District
Press Committee, CPEPD) was held at Boslover Hall on 12/14,15/63.
On 3/20/64 "The Advocates" is sponsoring a banquet to be held

at Boslover Hall. Both of these activities are for the pur-
pose of raising funds for the support of "The Worker."

As set forth in Philadelphia airtel and LHM cap-
tioned, “BETTY GANNETT; IS - C," and dated 3/4/64, GANNETT
yas scheduled to teach a Marxist class on Political Economy |
tat Boslover Hall commencing 3/4/64 and ending 5/7/64. The
‘classes are to be held every other Wednesday. They are
under the nominal sponsorship of the PSSFC.

 

On 3/4/64, PH 547-S* advised IC DONALD J. WALL
j that BETTY GANNETT would not come to Philadelphia on 3/4/64
as so few persons had registered for the course. She is
now tentatively scheduled to start the series on about u)
3/18/64, providing additional registrations are obtained.

PH 398-S on 3/5/64 advised SA JEREMIAH W., DOYLE
that on the evening of 3/4/64 he went to Boslover Hall to
attend the Political Economy class; however, the maintenance
man there said that the management at Boslover Hall had
received a call that afternoon notifying them that the
class on 3/4/64 would not be held, “

member District Executive Committee, CPEPD, was successful

in obtaining Boslover Hall for the 1963-1964 PSSFC Series,
he stated that perhaps this would end the harassment

of the PSSFC as they had been refused meeting places in
hotels and other halls located in a more accessible area
of Philadelphia. ¢

(PH 55-8, 9/63)

A review of the file concerning the PSSFC reflects
that this organization, which since its inception in 1958
has utilized CP leaders and prominent left orientated
speakers, has utilized the following meeting halls:

Adelphia Hotel
13th and Chestnut Streets
1 1958 through 10/12/62

ae Benjamin Franklin Hotel
5 Oth and Chestnut Streets
- 11/62 meeting

 

. ' " New Century Club
7 124 South 12th Street
: ' 1/63 through 3/63 ae

Philadelphia Ethical Society Hall
1906 Rittenhouse Square
4/63 and 5/63

Boslover Hall
701 Pine Street :
Utilized for 1963-1964 Series

The Ethical Culture Hall has been utilized by
a Wide variety of leftist organizations over the years.
Among others, SANE, Women's Iyiternational League for Peace
and Freedom, National Committee to Abolish the House Un-
American Activities Committee, Emergency Civil Liberties
Committee, Delaware Valley Committee for Democratic Rights,
etc., have met at Ethical Culture Hall. :

On 3/11/64 a meeting under the sponsorship of
"The Guardian" is to be held there. MARR LANE, Attorney
