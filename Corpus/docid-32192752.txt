GARY RICHARD GOCCHNOUR,
MISCELLANEOUS INFO CONCERNING

SAC, NEW ORLEANS (47-

See 62-4512 and 190-2 for previous information
regarding captioned subject. This information
characterizes him as a chronic complainer, and a source
of pessibly spurious information regarding the KENNEDY
assassination.

On 4/5/79, former symbol source CSNG 1318 -_R
telephonically advised that he had received a complaint
from 2 individuals who are visiting professors in New
Orleans to attend a conference at Tulane University regarding
World War II and the Holocaust. As the attached sheet
indicates, these two individuals encountered GOCHNOUR
who was apparently the owner or the manager of the Golumns
Hotel on St. “Charles Avenue where GOCHNOUR arrogantly
insisted that the deaths of the 6 million Jews during
World War ZI were not attributable to HITLER or Nazi
Germany, but were the victims of typhoid.

What is net noted on the attached sheet is the
fact that GOCHNOUR introduced himself as an ex-FBI Agent,
and in order to gain credence to add weight to his argument,
indicated that any FBI office would vouch for GOCHNOUR.
The source furnishing this information indicated that, though
GCOCHNOUR was his own worse enemy in not making himself
believable, nevertheless people hearing GOCHNOUR state

_such information, might very well have obtained an unfavorable

impression of the FBI from GOCHNOUR's comments.

This information is being furnished for reference
sake, and any action deemed appropriate. If GOCHNOUR is
confronted by this information, it is recommended that the
source be concealed, but the information in the attached

‘complaint is not “privileged.
