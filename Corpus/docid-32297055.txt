RE: JOHN ROSELLI, aka
AR

Al GEORGE HOPKINS, Manager, Glen Towers Apartments,
af advised that he did not observe ROSSELLI around the apartment

from about last Sunday until the morning of February 12, 1965.
He said, however, that on February 10, 1965, he observed
ROSSELLI's car in the garage for the first.time since last
Sunday. He also observed a girl around the apartment since
Wednesday and he believes, but does not know for certain,
that she has been staying in an apartment on the same floor
as ROSSELLI's apartment. On February le, 1965, HOPKINS
examined a photograph of KATHY HORDEN and stated that she is
the girl he has seen around the apartment. It would appear
that HORDEN is probably again living with ROSSELLI. H
