time, he was President of the Havana Society of Civil
Engineers and was exployed by the Frederick Snare
Corporation on the Hotel Hilton project. When Batista,
wes overthrown, Castro made Ray his Minister of
Public Works. Ray did a very creditable job “re-
building” Cuba and acquired a substantial popular
following. As Minister of Public Works, he showed a |
great understanding of the needs of the people of Cuba
and a real concern for their welfare.

Although liberal and pro-revolutionary, Ray resented
the Communist domination of the Castro regime and in
November 1959 he was replaced by a Communist. He
lived for several months under surveillance that
amounted to house arrest and was unable to acquire
another post. However, he remained in Cuba and
organized the MRP as an anti-Castro movement. Ke
escaped to the US in Cctober 1960. His leadership,
ebility, and integrity are unmistakable.

In the US as an MRP leader.
