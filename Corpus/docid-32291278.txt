MM 92-515

MM 509-C-TE advised that MILTON SPITZER's true
name is MILTON SPENCER (Miami 165-211); that SPITZER gave
up the gambling and bookmaking operation at the Miami Beach
Raly Club after two weeks; that SPITZER is now associating
with NAT FARBER (Miami File 92-118) on a daily basis and it
is rumored FARBER is bankrolling SPITZER in his gambling,
bookmaking and shylock operations.

This source also advised that on 3/23/63, JOE
INDELICATO (Miami File 92-404) spent almost five hours with
SAMMY WEISS at the Patio Bridge Club, Miami Beach, in an
effort to secure a loan of $25,000 from WEISS. INDELICATO
was heard to say that he could nottake "No" for an answer and
was heard pleading with WEISS for the money. Near the end
of their meeting, WEISS finally agreed to loan INDELICATO the
money. Comment was made that INDELICATO needed the money
because he was in bad with the "boys" up north.

of a gambling establishment in New York City, and now part
owner of the Patio Bridge Club, Miami Beach, who is currently
in Las Vegas, has reportedly secured a "solid OK" to start
