MAX FRIEDSON. BEILER advised that he informed SELIGMAN he
was not interested and that such an organization would

further info at which time he advised that the group dis-
cussed by FRIEDSON and SELIGMAN had been formed and had

and he believed it was the Miami Chapter of the ACLU. He
had not attended any meetings.
