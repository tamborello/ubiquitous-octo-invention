by a determination that he was mentally incompetent, that

Snyder wanted to avoid a repetition of this incident, and

that “other considerations" meant common sense and prudence.
After this meeting with Oswald, Snyder did not talk

with McVickar and he did’ not contact any intelligence officers;

instead, he drafted a cable to be sent to Washington. Since

this cable contained all of the information Snyder obtained

from Oswald, and since it would be sent through the appropriate

’
persons at the embassy, he saw no need to contact anyone. He

may have talked to Freers before he sent the cable, but he did
not talk to anyone else. No one in the embassy approached him
to discuss this cable.

Several days later Oswald sent Snyder a letter protesting

his treatment at the embassy. Snyder cabled this information

to Washington.

McVickar may have tipped journalist Priscilla Johnson
McMillan concerning Oswald's visit to the embassy. McVickar
never told Snyder about any information on Oswald which McVickar
may have obtained from McMillan. Snyder knows of no other jour-
nalists who were tipped about Oswald's defection.

Regarding contacts with American journalists in Moscow,
Snyder stated that he knew Priscilla Johnson McMillan personally,
knew of A.’I. Goldberg, had an official contact with Aline Mosby
concerning a Soviet provocation, and had two or three official
contacts with R. J. (Bud) Korengold concerning consular issues

which could not be followed up at the embassy. In recent years

Snyder has had contact with McMillan concerning her book
Marina and Lee as it pertains to Snyder.

Snyder remembers that some time after Oswald's visit
to the embassy Oswald sent two letters to the embassy from
Minsk.

Snyder had two meetings with Oswald upon his return from
Minsk in 1961. Snyder has no independent recollection of the
first of these meetings, but he said that records show that
such a meeting occurred on a Saturday. The meeting must have
been brief. Oswald probably said that he wanted to return to
the United States, and Snyder probably told Oswald to come back
to the embassy later. McVickar and Snyder's secretary Verna
Deane Brown probably had contact with Oswald during this visit
and during Oswald's subsequent visit.

When Oswald returned to the embassy he seemed "meek."
He probably admitted that he had "learned a hard lesson the hard
way," and. he expressed a concern that he might be prosecuted.
Snyder asked him about his various activities in the Soviet
Union. Oswald stated that he had not given any information to
the Soviets.

Snyder did not expedite Oswald's actual return to the
United States, which transpired after Snyder had left the Soviet
Union. Snyder did not expedite Oswald's application to renew
his passport; instead, he gave it "no great priority” as a

"petty way of getting even" with Oswald, whom he did not like.

citizenship. He recalls that he and Oswald talked alone, al-
though McVickar was in an adjoining office with the door open.
Snyder said that McVickar's claim that he was in the same room

‘ may be correct, but that he (Snyder) cannot remember for certain.
Oswald appeared to be determined and "uptight," and he declined
to sit, although he probably did sit later. He gave Snyder a
note stating that he wanted to renounce his American citizenship.
He either gave Snyder His passport or Snyder asked for it. Os-
wala said that he had been a radar operator in);the Marine Corps,
and that he intended to give information he possessed to_the
Soviets. Snyder's response was to attempt to delay any action
by Oswald and to get more information from Oswald. . Oswald was
not talkative, but “humorless," and this meeting did not last
long--possibly one hour or so.

Snyder recalls that during this meeting Oswald did not
mention the specific military information which he possessed,
nor did he mention John F. Kennedy, political assassination, the
President of the United States, or Cuba. Oswald. did talk about
the imperialism of the United States, his disloyalty to the
United States, his loyalty to the Soviet Union, and the fact
that he was a Marxist.

When asked to explain why he wanted to delay Oswald's
denunciation “in view of the Petrulli case and other considera-

tions" (W.R. 748; C.E. 908), Snyder stated that Nicholas Petrulli

had earlier defected, that Petrulli's defection was nullified

‘Soviets for defection. “

Snyder said Minister Counselor Edward L. Freers (de-
ceased) was not a CIA employee. He did not know whether John
A. McVickar, his colleague in the consular office, was a CIA
employee. McVickar, who arrived in Moscow before Snyder and
departed after snyder, worked with Snyder throughout his two-
year tour of duty in Moscow. Like L'Angeli, McVickar was once
approached by the Soviets for defection. Snyder said he never
told McVickar, whom he first met in 1959, that he (Snyder) had
once been a CIA employee. Snyder said that when asked by Dan
Rather of CBS if he (Snyder) had baen with the CIA, he replied
that in the Soviet Union he had been nothing other than what
he claimed to be. ;

Snyder said that when he testified before the Warren Com-
mission, he was not asked whether he had ever been a CIA employee.
After he testified, he told Allen Dulles that he had once worked
for the Agency. Dulles did not show much interest.

Snyder remembers that during his tour of duty in Moscow,
there came to his attention three defector cases--Robert Edward
Webster, Nicholas Petrulli, and then Lee Harvey Oswald. On
October 28, 1959, just before Oswald defected, Snyder sent a let-
ter (C.F. 914) to the State Department requesting advice on hand-
ling cases of defection. Snyder said that this request was not
directed at any particular case.

Snyder first became aware of Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald

came to the embassy on October 31, 1959, to renounce his American

Interview:. Robert Genzman, Harold Leap, and Beth Lichtenfels
interviewed Richard E. Snyder, retired Foreign Service Officer,
on April 14, 1978, at the Committee offices. The interview
yielded the following information:

Snyder was born on December 10, 1919. He served in the
Army from 1940 to 1946, and then attended Yale University, where
he received a degree and completed a year of graduate work. He
took the Foreign Service exam during his senior year of college,
passed the exam, and was placed on the waiting list for Foreign
Service assignments. He did not know anyone who took the Foreign
Service exam when he did, and he did not know anyone else on the
Foreign Service waiting list. ‘

In October 1949, Snyder was contacted by the Central In-
telligence Agency and was asked whether he desired employment
with the Agency. He was told that the State Department had cir-
culated its Foreign Service waiting list to the CIA. Although

he thought he would be called for State Department employment

within a year or so, and although he knew he would accept such

employment, he applied to the CIA primarily for financial rea-
sons, was accepted, and served from 1949 to 1950. Most of
his CIA service consisted of training; he did little substan-
tive work for the Agency.

‘snyder completely terminated his CIA employment and en-
tered the Foreign Service in 1950. He cannot recall any contact
with the CIA since 1950, aside from a letter which he-sent to
the Agency after he retired from the State Department circa
1970 to inquire about contract work possibilities. The CIA's
response was negative.

Snyder has been in Military Intelligence and Military
Intelligence Reserve since the time of his active Army duty
(1940-1946), although there has never been any connection be-
tween his State Department employment and his military posi-
tions. He is currently in inactive Military Intelligence Re-
serve.

Snyder served as a consular officer at the American Em-
bassy in Moscow from July 1959 to July 1961. When shown lists
of State Department personnel in Moscow for the years 1959 and
1960, he said he could recognize no CIA personnel. He did not
know who had been the CIA's Chief of Station in Moscow when
he served there. He said that the military attache people at
the Embassy may have been CIA employees, and that the travel
officer and the security officer named L'Angeli (phonetic) may

have been CIA employees. L'Angeli was once approached by the
