From ae, M. Boyle

Subject: run fous SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)
INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER
KING, JR.

PURPOSE: To facilitate the placement of xeroxed copies and
ticklers of the FBI material previously requested by the HSCA,
concerning the circumstances of the assassination of DR. MARTIN
LUTHER KING, JR. into Bufile 62-117290.

RECOMMENDATION: That the above-referenced materials be made an
enclosure (168 boxes) to this memorandum and maintained as a
bulky exhibit to Bufile 62-117290, inasmuch as they have been
made available to the HSCA.

DRTAILS: In compliance with numerous requests from the HSCA, the
former Congressional Inquiry Unit (organized to respond to
requests from the HSCA for FBI records: concerning PRESIDENT
KENNEDY and DR. KING) made copies of FBI records available as
sought by the HSCA.

Upon completion of its assigned tasks, the
Congressional Inquiry Unit disbanded and made its compilation of
records available to the Freedom of Information-Privacy Acts
Section, due to extensive FOIA litigation in both the KENNEDY and
KING assassination matters.

Currently the copies of FBI records concerning the
assassination of PRESIDENT KENNEDY are being reviewed in
accordance with the "President John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act of 1992."

Because of the public’s continued interest in the
alleged circumstances surrounding the assassination of DR. KING
it is anticipated that the subject of this memorandum will
eventually become the target of a Freedom of Information Act
request. It is, therefore, deemed appropriate that these
materials be made a part of a retrievable permanent record.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Task Force Report

Clarence M, Kelley, Director’
Yederal Bureau of Investigation

' Attn: Congressional Inquiry Unit
Special Investigative Division

This will confirm the telephone conversation at
3:30 p.m., this date between S.A. Jay Aldhizer, Congressional
Inquiry Unit, and Joseph F. Gross, Jr., of my staff concerning
Appendix C to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Task Force Report.

It is my understanding that your review and classification
of Appendix C is complete. But the appendix contains material
relating to sensitive’ sources which the Bureau would want to
review for excision if'the appendix is ever disseminated to
interested parties such as the House Select Committee on
AssasSinations.

Mr. Gross has also advised me that during the time in
which this additional review may be necessary the Bureau
has agreed to retain custody of the appendix, After this
period the appendix is to be returned to this Office.

Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.
