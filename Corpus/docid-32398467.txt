‘MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT: George Martin Roanek

1. You have requested our assistance with regard to certain
personal legal problems of subject defector. This memorandum is
intended to summarize our suggested solutions to these problems.

- 2. With respect to the subject's filing for divorce, we.
concluded that Virginia was the best jurisdiction for the following
teasons. First, subject lived at ISOLATION for a period of almost.
five years before moving to a aafehouse in Herndox, Virginia. Thus;
any legal residence in the United States would have been in Virginia.
Hie recent move to Maryland causes us some concern but only
technically. In view of the strong part played by the Agency in
subject's search for and selection of the Maryland dwelling, it is
fair to conclude that he was directed to live in Maryland by the
United States Government and, therefore, would not relinquish:
whatever Virginia residence he had at the time of the move. Second,
the requirement for non-traceability ‘in the divorce proceedings is
very well fulfilled in an arrangement we have laid on with a Tappa-

_hannock, Essex County, Virginia lawyer, Mr. Joseph Spruill, Jr. .
He in turn hae spoken with the Cireuit Court Judge of Essex County
who would hear the case and has arranged te omit newspaper
publication either of the calendar scheduling of the hearing or of
the order for the divorce iteelf.. The judge hae stated that he will
hear the case in chamber and that all pleadings will be oral: While

& witness from the Agency will be required to testify as to length of
xesidence, length of separation of the couple and likelihood of
reconciliation, the oral hearing will net be recorded. Any paper
work will be sealed and returned to Spruill and then to us. The only
record made will he of the divorce itself set forth in the Circuit
Court récord book in subject's true name.

3. The plan is for subject te check into the Tappahanneck
Motor Inn on the afternoon of the 22nd of September. This will _
establish the necessary venue to give the court jurisdiction over the
subject matter of the suit. The actual hearing will be at 4:06 p.m.,
Tuesday, the 23ed of September, in the Essex * County Court House
in ‘Tappahannock.

. 4. Subject wae required to sign an Affidavit for Service by
Publication stating that hie wife's last post office address is unknown
tohim. The judge has been briefed on the fact that the subject could
provide an address where he last saw his wife but that personal security
reasond préclude his doing so. Service has issued and been posted to
his wife, address unknown, with return address to the court. The
jadge has ruled that this procedure satisfied the statute with regard to
service by publication.

&. After the divorce subject m may apply for 4 marriage license
in Maryland in his assumed name. We have ascertained that the Clerk
will ask whether he has. been married before and whether divorced.

He may simply answer by stating that he was divorced on 23 September
in the Circuit Court of Eseex County Virginia., He does not have to
produce any document proving the divorce and, therefore, the name

_ under which he was-divorced, Since either party may apply for the
Heensé, we would suggest that bie fiancee actually submit the
application for marriage since this would eliminate any possible
question of perjury during the interview with the Clerk.

6. Subject can legally live under his assumed name without -
the formality of the name change in view of the fact that the new
name hag hot béen contrived to deceive or defraud others. He may
also formally change his name at a later date. Oar suggestion would
be that if and when he seeke citizenship by a private bill, his name
be securely changed at that time to the mame under which hé has been.
living.

. 7. We will gladly answer any questions you may have concerning
these rather unusual arrangementa..
