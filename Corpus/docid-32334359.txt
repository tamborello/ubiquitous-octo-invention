THE MINUTEMEN

ERNEST AVANTS, Natchez, Mississippi, is very interested
in the Minutemen Organization and talks a great deal about
revolution. He does not seem interested in actually joining
the Minutemen,

It is believed that a man named (FNU) GUTHRIE in
Ferriday, Louisiana, has tried for sometime to join the Minutemen
and has recently been tentatively accepted for membership.

It has been brought out that each Minuteman knows only
four other members of the organization.

MISCELLANEOUS

There has been no discussion or indication among members
of the WKEKKOM that any new organization is being formed in which
the members would wear uniforms or be required to own highpowered
rifles.

There has been no discussion or indication of knowledge
among members of the WKRKKOM in the Adams County, Mississippi,
area, with regard to the burning of the COFO House at Indianola,
Mississippi, recently.

JULIUS HARPER, BILLY BUCKLES and SAM BOWERS have discussed
at length the manner in which the bodies of the three slain civil
righte workers in Neshoba County, Mississippi, were digcovered, It
is the consensus opinion among these individuels that the bodies
were found as a result of a lucky guess on the part of Agents after
seeing fresh dirt from a helicoptor flying over the area im which
the bodies were found.
