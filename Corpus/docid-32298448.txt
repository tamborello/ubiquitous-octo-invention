The following information is included on the admin-
istrative pages because PH 614-C-TE is involved in the matter
in a manner which it is not possible to conceal. The information

was obtained from him by SA JOSEPH A, VERICA, 3/17/62.

At a time, which. source was unable to remember
exactly but when the Maggio Cheese Company was in its old
location at Ninth and Montrose Streets, informant was called
there to see MARIO MAGGIO and ANGELO BRUNO. He was told that
a cousin of MARTO's, named MONTALBANO, a druggist in the
vicinity of 54th Street and City Line Avenue, Philadelphia,
had been arrested: by Captain CLARENCE J, FERGUSON, Philadelphia
Police Department, on a narcotics.charge and had been held
for court by Magistrate BENJAMIN SEGAL,

MARIO MAGGIO asked the source to make some kind -
of contact with Captain FERGUSON and get the case "washed,"

Through a cousin, NAT FRANK, who writes a column,
"Prankly Speaking," in a local newspaper, "The Observer," and
who has numerous political connections at City Hall, the
source met Captain FERGUSON at the Venice Grill on Leth Street
and discussed the MONTALBANO case.

FERGUSON was agreeablé to an arrangément, ‘but said
he must have $7,500, $2,500 of which was to go to the attorney
who would defend MONTALBANO, and FERGUSON said that would
have to be JOSEPH ALESSANDRONI.

This was agreeable to MAGGIO, but the trial resulted
in MONTALBANO being placed on probation, MAGGIO felt ‘that
FERGUSON had not lived up to his agreement, and ‘it was
finally agreed that hé would accept $5,000 instead of the
original $7,500. This money was obtained by the source from
MARIO MAGGIO and delivered in a paper bag to FERGUSON at the :
Venice Grill shortly after the trial. FERGUSON took the bag ©
to the basement, where He presumably counted it, returned, and
said everything was all right.

The informant did not know the significance of the
notations on these cards, nor the identity of the collector.
as it appears a sum of money is collected each month to defray

a loan, a debt, or to repay, “anservice.

‘Philadelphia Office will trace ownership of a
representative number of identified vehicles listed above
to determine. if all were purchased from the same source and
if BRUNO has proprietary interest in.that source.

Source believes that FRANK IANNARELLA is the
collector who made the notations and is active in collecting
‘that reflected above.

It is to be rioted on May 8, 1962, PH 614-C made
available the check book of Penn Jersey Vending, Inc., showing
all. transactions from January to May 18, 1962. Same has
been photostated and is an exhibit in this file.

Also available at this office is a list of all
BRUNO's cigarette vending machine stops in Philadelphia. For
brevity the same is not reflected in this report, however,
where it is apparent dual capacity servéssBRUNO at these
locations, i.e., gambling, horse betting, and cigarette vending,

' game will be established by investigation.

By separate communication each office receiving a
copy of this report will in the near future be furnished specific
leads as well as an index.

Present investigation indicates that several
investigative leads will be set forth in those offices which
are receiving only one copy of the above report.
