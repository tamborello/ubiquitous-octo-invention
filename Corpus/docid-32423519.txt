12 | Senator Huddleston. ALL right.

13 | I think when we adjourned yesterday we had two matters

14 | before us. One was relating to the covert action section which

15 llwe have new suggestions ana new proposals to be made and conside ed
16 by the Committee. Those /have been put into written form. I

17 || believe. all members have a copy, of it.

18 I would suggest that we delay consideration of that

 

19 section ‘until at least ‘tomorrow to give time for thought since

22 || revision. . . .
23 Mr. Aaron. Yes, we |lwere on Section D, starting on page 61,

24 || dealing with the structure of the CIA. I think apart from
