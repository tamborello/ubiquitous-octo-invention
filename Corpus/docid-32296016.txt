PAGE 3 FROM PHILADELPHIA 082000

IN FLORIDA INTENDING TO REMAIN APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS
CONTINUING INVESTIGATION OF ANGELO BRUNO'S TAX MATTERS.

CHIOVERO IN SUBSTANCE WAS STATING THAT HE WAS IN CHARGE

OF IRS INVESTIGATION IN PHILADELPHIA. AL SIASI MENTIONED

ABOVE HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE REVENUE AGENT DOING AUDITING
WORK ON UNKNOWN PHASE OF BRUNO'S TAX INVESTIGATION. IT IS

KNOWN THAT CHIOVERO HAS INTERVIEWED SUBJECT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS
AND 1F DESIROUS OF INTERVIEWING OR ARRANGING AN APPOINTMENT -
WITH BRUNO FOR LEGITIMATE REASON IN LINE OF OFFICIAL BUSINESS,
-WOULD NOT NEED LOU AS AN INTERMEDIARY. © MARIO MAGGIO'S INTEREST:
IN IRS AGENT AL SIASI MAY BE DUE TO POSSIBILITY HE CONDUCTED
AUDET OF RECORDS OF BRUNO'S NEPHEW, MICHAEL GRASSO, WHO
APPARENTLY 1S NOT TRUSTED BY MARIO MAGGIO, AT THE PRESENT

TIME THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT LOU MAY BE MAC ING OVERTURES
TO BRUNO AND THE MAGGIO BROTHERS, WITH APPROVAL OF JOHN
CHIOVERO, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS, HOWEVER, THAT LOU MAY BE
CLAIMING TO REPRESENT CHIOVERO AND AL SIASI TO ENHANCE
HIMSELF WITH BRUNO, WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF OBTAINING A GIFT.
ACCORDINGLY, THE PHILADELPHIA DIVISION 1S OPENING A SEPARATE
INVESTIGATION ENTITLED "LOUIS ALFRED PERSICHETTI; BRIBERY,"

AND WILL ADD CHIOVERO AND SIASI AS SUBJECTS IF INVESTIGATION 4
ESTABLISHES THIS FACT. WITH TWO TECHNICAL SOURCES IN OPERATION, ~~
PLUS A LIVE INFORMANT IN THE EMPLOY OF THE SUBJECT, IT 1S FELT

THAT BEST RESULTS CAN BE OBTAINED BY USE OF INFORMANTS RATHER

THAN OPEN ACTIVE INVESTIGATHON, THE POSSIBILITY THAT SURVEIL-

LANCES AND OPEN INVESTIGATION COULD JEOPARDIZE INFORMANTS IN

THIS MATTER 1S REALIZED. MIAMI AND NEW=ARK ARE BEING ADVISED .
|____BY MAIl COPIES WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO USE DISCRETION, IN THE

EVENT THEY RECEIVE AN INQUIRY FROM IRS RE BRUNO, CONSIDERING

THAT IRS 1S CONDUCTING INVESTIGATION ON SUBJECT IN BOTH THE
NEWARK AND MIAMI DIVISIONS, BRUNO CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.
