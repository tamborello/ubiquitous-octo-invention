Aronson ig one of those who in Paris sees the most soviet
visitora of all kind.Bhrough the Dr.Ilasry I met last year
& group of soviet physicians.

Wa know the hroneon”for yearg,but it is the first time that
he got really talkative.He related quite a number of things — .
‘about his encounters with soviet citizens who come to /rance
and 80 we learned that he invites them regulerely to his re-
staurant/"DPominic",19,rue Bréa, Paris 6/ - sometimes as many
as 15 to 20 persons.Moreover soviet citizens of 811 kind :

artists, psinters,actors and directors of theatre,but also
journalists - for instance from "“pravda" and "Izvest{a” ,come
to see him privately in his house.

a

Last night however he taiked mainly about various visits he”

had in the past.He did'nt mension -once somebody who is pre-

sently or wae recently in Paris.Shen I asked him if he had

not seen Bhem now,these last days,he said s"no,nobody” and

he added that the lest time,since the Tchecoslovaquia events

the soviet visitors became far lees numerous.This might be

true,but I had impression that% it was on purpose that Aron-

son did not want to tell about recent visits he had. received.

He is a very cautious man and as he met yesterday for the

lest timo the Dr.laery and his wife he parhaps did not want

to tell too much about this. . }

We established recently very friendly reletions with the
Aronson ang yesterday's gathering certainly contributed to
tighten our link with them.It remains to be seen if in the
futur he will reveal more about his encounters with the so-
viet visitors nd if he will be willing to help us meeting
with then. : :

What can be established wlready is that he certainly ia well

aan _.- connected with a number of them and that his restaurant is

” = place where they come frequently.that ie his purpose of

meeting them ? I and 2, are-not inclined to think thet hoe
works for them : he is a rich man and does'nt need it.Also i
he cortainly hes not the mentality of a communist sympathicer.
Hore likely he sees them because he loves art and literature fF
