Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Act of 1992 (the Act)
Synopsis: The Act established the Assassination Records Review
Board (ARRB) to oversee the governments’ production and
compliance with the Act. The ARRB reviews the proposed
postponements in the documents sent by each agency to the
National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and decides
what postponements the Act allows or opens the document in full.
The ARRB’s responsibilities include having agencies search other
subjects and areas to find additional material not already
identified as assassination records. The establishment of the
ARRB by the Act also limited the time for their duties to be
accomplished. The ARRB must complete their tasks, by September
1997. With this deadline in mind, the ARRB sent a letter
requesting additional information.

Enclosures: ARRB letter requesting material

Details: On June 6, 1997, the ARRB sent a letter to the FBI
setting forth a formal request to receive and review additional
records. The ARRB’s goal is to research every possible subject
that may have a bearing on assassination theories and to assure
Congress and the American public that all was done to accomplish
the intentions of the Act.

Los Angeles should conduct a search of its office for
the listed items. If Los Angeles is aware of any administrative
records they may have maintained outside the normal index system,
‘they should include those areas in the search. If any documents
related to the matter is found, please forward documents to the

and the FBI must follow the Act. If Los Angeles believes their
office needs a copy, they should copy the document or material
