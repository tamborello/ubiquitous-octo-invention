B. Types of DA Operations by Origin.

_ ° Almost all double agent operations begin in one of three
wayé: a walk-in or talk-in, hostile agent detected and
. doubled, or a provocation, KUBARK often acquires a DA

case by transfer from another 'ODYOKE: service or from

‘liaison; when it does, it is important that the type of origin
be included in the information obtained from the transferring
service. A DA,case can ‘also result if one service offers
recruitment to the agent of another not because of provoca-
tion or stake-out but by chance,

   

L The Transferred Agent.

 

me . Analysis. suggests that nearly two-thirds of KUBARK'‘s
DA operations begin (for KUBARK) by transfer from another ‘
service, Usually, however, the transferring service merely
made initial contact with a walk-in and turned him over to
KUBARK without having used him operationally. If a going |
i) operation is transferred, it is vital that the base or case an

 

@

officer accepting jurisdiction obtain the case-records of the :
prior service, If:these.are- unavailable; knowledgeable: +: -
representatives of the:transferring service'should:be de<' ©
“briefed as completely.as'‘possible, Flaws imbedded ‘in the
operation may make it unsuitable for exploitation or may
require correction. In addition to determining origin, the
KUBARK case officer should obtain the prior service's :
assessment of the DA, both as person and as agent. Even

if the case officer considers that the earlier handling was
defective, he should give due weight to such an assessment.
In a few operations KUBARK has repeated the mistakes. of
the transferring service through failure to obtain an assess-
ment or’ through ignoring the earlier record. : :

   

2, The Walk-In and Talk-In,

More than half of KUBARK's DA cases start because
an agent of an adversary service volunteers information to a

non-Bloc service or official, Although the danger of provo-
cation is always present in walk-in cases, the fact remains
' that DA operations that have begun in thia way have, as a
class, proven more rewarding to KUBARK than any other
type. The agent of an adversary service who approaches.
_ KUBARK and volunteers information about the adversary has
'@ choice of a number of means of making the first contact.
In addition to presenting himself physically (to KUBARK or
: any/ODYOKE. intermediary), he can send an emissary,
write a letter, make a phone call, or even establish radio
: contact, KUBARK's problem,clearly, is to separate the
: walk-ins and talk-ins who are acting on their own initiative
from those who. are seeking contact at the instigation of a
hostile service.

 

 

 

3. Detected and Doubled (D & D).

  
   
    
   
 
 
   
   
   
 
 
   
   

About a fifth of the DA cases handled directly by
KUBARK: have begun with the identification of a hostile
agent, -interrogation, and doubling, Analysis suggests
that in peacetime D&D. cases are frequently perilous and +.
: ‘unprofitable. _The:agent's agreement'to double, obtained
j under stated or, implied duress, is rarely accompanied by~

: va real -switch-in loyalties. -. The likeliest exception is the |
agent. who served the adversary unwillingly, under pressure,
and who (though afraid to approach the authorities on his own
initiative) is relieved when his clandestine role is brought
te light, The risk in handling D & D cases is also mitigated

' in joint operations conducted with liaison services that can
exercise strong executive authority.

-4 The Provocation Agent,
; Provocation is the least common origin of DA cases,
When employed, it has, in the past, been used by a Bloc

service against KUBARK or another Western service more
frequently than vice-versa, Provocation may be direct, as

Ml, THE DOUBLE AGENT OPERATION:
_ GENERAL PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
GENERAL PRELIMINARY CONSIDERA TIONS

"A discussion of operational details appears in Part V
of this.guide. Here the purpose is to present basic infor-
mation and principles about the beginnings of DA operations.

A. Definition,

A double agent is a person who engages in clandestine
activity for two intelligence or security services (or more
in joint operations), who provides inforrnation about one to
the other or about each to the other, and who is. wittingly
withholding significant information from one on the instruc-

. Hons of the other or is unwittingly manipulated by one so

that significant information ig: seithheld from the other.
service, Peddlers, fabricaters, and others who do not per-
form a service for an intelligence organization, ‘but only for
themselves, are not agents at all and therefore-are not .*
DA's. Asa rule the DA has an agent relationship with both -
services; a fact which distinguishes him: from the’ Penetration :
agent, who usually serves the Cl service as an agent but.the.
target or adversary service as a staff member or ina staff
capacity. Multiple agents frequently draw a variety of
agsigaments from several services. Although they may pro-
vide counterintelligence information, and although they

 

‘present difficulties in handling and security which resemble

these problems in the double agent operation, the two types
are distinct. The DA is usually directed against a single
adversary, whereas the multiple agent resembles a private
detective with a number of clients,

The part of the definition which stipulates the with-
holding of significant information results from the fact that
an agent who tells everything he knows to both sides becomes,
unless unwittingly manipulated by one of the services, an un-
authorized liaison channel with the enemy. Such situations
are unprofitable and cease to be operations,
