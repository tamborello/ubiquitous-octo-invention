Re Bureau airtel, 5/10/68.

Lt..Commander D, F, SMITH, U. S. Coast Guard, Mobile,
advised that the vessel "Granwood" was placed in dry dock on
5/20/68, and he had an opportunity to examine it.

He stated that there was damage done to the vessel
which, in his opinion, was caused by an explosion from outside
the ship near a grate through which water was being pumped to
cool the engines. He stated that the explosion was definitely
from the outside of the ship and was of such force as to raise
the deck of the engine room approximately four inches.

He stated that he had determined from the log of the
ship that the explosion took place some 17 miles southwest of
Key West, Fla., definitely in international waters.

Toast
He stated there was considerable interest ‘in’ this
ship at the present time by the British Government, steamship
line representatives and insurance underwriters. In yiew of
this and since the matter took place in international, lwaters,

 

 

he was not conductipe any at investigation;
