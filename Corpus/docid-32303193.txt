By @@ letter, 12/15/61, the Pittsburgh Office requested

the establishment of a highly confidential source at the

Pines Motel, Leechburg, Pa., to cover the activities and
discussions of SAM MANNARINO during his visits to that
establishment. By airtel dated 12/20/61, the Bureau refused
authorization for such an installation due to the very short
period of time that such installation could be operated, and
because the Pittsburgh Office had not developed any information
that people other than SAMUEL MANNARINO's secretary occupied
the motel unit.

phases of the activities of the MANNARINOs had agreed that
the IRS raid in New Kensington, Pa., on 8/24/61, the
Westmoreland County raid of 9/17/61, the FGJ inquiry in
Pittsburgh, and the election of reform candidates for the
New Kensington city administration had all combined to make

curtailed gambling and the resultant inactivity of the
MANNARINOs and their associates-employees.
