ADMINISTRATIVE: a

On 8/4/70, SA ROGER A, BOMBARDIER conducted a
discreet inquiry at Fornof Cadillac-Oldsmobile Dealer, .

West Main St., Houma, La., and determined that a white over

gold 1970 Cadillac bearing 1970 Louisiana license 51 M 041

is owned by BOB COURNOYER, Sales Manager, Fornof Company.

COURNOYER is. the subject of New Orleans 165-1527.

‘During SA BOMBARDIER'sS conversation with COURNOYER
on 8/4/70, COURNOYER stated. that he recently purchased four
race horses.in claim races in Chicago and that these horses,
along with 12 others, owned by Mr. BRADY of the Brady Machine
Company in Houma, La., were being trained by SANDY BROUILLETTE
of Abbeville, Louisiana. -

J “COURNOYER asked SA BOMBARDIER that if he received :
a telephone calli from his trainer in.Chicago advising that
\ one of his horses looked good in an upcoming race, whether or
‘not he could bet this horse with his trainer and not be in~
violation of any Federal law. COURNOYER was advised to con-
tact his attorney or the USA's Office in New Orleans for
legal advice regarding this matter.

New Orleans indices contain no references for E. WwW.
STEFFENHAGEN or °.. Avla, Inc. Indices did contain an old 33
reference from a- Jackson Division file on EDWIN M. ANDERSON,
However, this file has apparently been destroyed,
