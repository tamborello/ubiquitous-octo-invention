3. I assured Mr. Blakey that 1} would be happy to discuss
with him any of the deleted items and explain the nature of
the content and the reason for its deletion. I told Mr. Blakey
that since he was personally reviewing the material, and the
same would hold true for Mr. Cornwell, I felt that I could be
very candid in describing the deleted portions. Mr. Blakey
thanked me, but did not at any time raise any questions about
deletions. After he had finished his refiyew J repeated my
offer to discuss any portion of the material. He again thanked
me and said he had no questions.

4, Mr. Blakey did not indicate (nor did I ask) whether
he would continue to seek access to the entire three volume

history in its unsanitized form.
