30% over this time lact year. The number of inquiries an aur computer website is also steadily
increasing. Since March, 1996 when the Cullectiun was madc available through tho NARA
website, the aseassination records have been accessed over 100,000 times by the publio. Many of
the written inquiries we reccive include copies of record identification forms taken from the
database, showing that the researcher has accessed our website and downloaded information. The
availability of the database via the Intemet remaing one of the most important developments that

have come from this process,

Due to the exceptional wark of the John FP. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board, preat
progress has been made on making available as complete a record as possible on the history of the
aseacemation of John Kennedy. Without the focus, integrity, and expertise of the ARBB, the
Colfection wuuld uot have the size, quality, or public demand witnessed today. However, there is

stif] much to do. NARA supporss passage of H.R. 1593 so that this important work can be

coruplieted.

Not only ties the Collection increased drematioally in size, the significance of the records in the
Collection cannot be overestimated. In addition to the records of numerous Kxecutive branch
agencies and offices, the records of relevant Congressional committees, related court cases, and
records donated by private entities are available in the Collection. This rich doasmantation is
searchable electronically, giving researchers the ability to seck out documents concerning a topic, :
Person, ui cycut, or cven individual documents, not oaly at NARA"s College Park facility, but
from their own personal computer through the imemet. Kqually important, the Collection

: provides researchers with a view of how our goverment worked during thie period in history, as
the documents reflect not only the operations of government as the offices and egoncies reacted to
the death of the President but also how these éffices and agencies were operating in regard to .
other events that are related to tho assassination, such ag the campaign to destabilize the
goverment of Cuba or the FBi's mvestigation of various organized crime figures. Perhaps tds
unique window on the operations of these agencies may be the most important result of the

development of the Collection.

Purthermore, tho Collection continues to grow. Additional FBI records will he added in the
weeks and months ahead. Kecords of the Departments of the Army and Nuvy and the Joint
Chiets of Staff are currently ander reviow. The addition of these records will only add to the

richness of the Collection and increase its value to the genoral research community.

Public demand far those records is the ultimate evidence of the the valuc of the Collection.

Reference requests have risen in number every year since the Cullovtiuu opened with new records

in August 1993. This year we have already received close to 600 written inquiries, an increase of

assassination of President Kennady. Wo would like to offer for your consideration some statistics

and facts to demonstrate the success of the Hoard and support its one-year extension.

The John F. Keanedy Assassination Records Collection today bears little resemblance to the
Collection that was established in December 1992. As that time, the Collection consisted of
approximately 450 oubia fact of records from a few agencies. Today, the Collection hae grown ta
more then 1,600 cubic feet of records or 3.75 million pages ftom more than 30 different

government offices. Those numbers are a testament to the work of the Review Board in

obtaining the cooperation of the entire Federal government in this irsportant task,

The ARRB has not only succeeded in obtaining the cooperation of the Federal agencies but has
also negotiated the donation of very important recards dist were previously held in private honds.
Donations have included the related papers of James Garrison and Edward Wegmann, the
prosecutor and defense attomey in the conspiracy trial of Clay Shaw, and the papers of J. Lee
Rankin, the General Counsel and Chief of Staff of the Warren Commission Copies of the papers
of Senator Richard Russell, a member of the Warren Commission, that were donated to the
University of Georgia are being reviewed uud we hope will be made part of the Collection ia the
near future with the agreement of the University. For the information df the Committes, Mr.
Chairman, I have attached to my testimony a copy of the Register of the Collection, which lists

the major groups of Federal recorde and private papers, along with the supplemental listing of FBI :

files.

serving for most of that tiae as the senior archivist for thos records, I also served ac the senior
archivist for the records of the National Security Council (NSC) following the transfer of the NSC
records of the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations in 1983. In 1989 I joined the staff of the
National Security Council, where I served as Director af Freedom of Information AcUPrivacy Act
Activities and later as NSC’s Director of lnformation Disclosure with responsibility for all
disclosure activilios of the NSC. In 1993, I returned to NARA to become the Chief of the JFK
Collection, and 1] have served in thet capacity ever since, I became the Chief of the Acucss aud

FOIA Staff in January of this year.

Uinder the JFK Act, NARA hed several major responsibilities, Three of these requirements,
lwwever, proved to be central to the work of the Assassination Records Review Roard. Our first’
responsibility was to formally establish the President John F. Kennedy Assussination Recards
Collection which we accomplished with the publication of an announcement in the Federal
Register on December 21, 1992. As astablished on that date, the Collection only consisted of
open secords already in NARA's custody, primarily the records of the Warren Commission.
Secondly, within 45 days of the statute being signed, NARA was required o prepare and make
available standard identification forms for use by all goveimnent officcs im describing assassination
records and to create a database of these forma to serve as an electronic finding aid to the JEK
Collection. Our third responsibility, which we shared with other government offices, was to
identify, review, and make available to the public all assassination records that could be disclosed _
under the provisions of tho law within s 300 day review periad . Nescriptions of all records
reviewed were required to be entered into the database whore they would be mado widely

available to the public.

At the cnd of the review pariod in August 1993, newly released records were made availahle for
research, includmg most of Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 Personality fle, part of the Central

Intelligence Agency's “segregated collection" of assassination related documents, and the records

af the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The database was also available for use by

researchers on thar day.

When the ARR members were confirmed by the Senate in April, 1994, ary staff and I began to
work with the Board and later with the Board’s staff, to provide information on the records in

the Collection at that tims, the development and use of the database, our contacts and discussions
with other agencies involved in searches for astassination related documents, and the existence of
assassination records in the cuctody of private repositories or individuals, The ARRB and NARA |
have maintained an excellent working relationihip duvugh the 3 yoars of the Board's existence,
and I would like to think that thia close relationship has in same way contributed to the success of
the ARRB.

NARA enthusiastically supports paseage of FLR. 1553 to extend the ARRB's authorization. Our
mission is not unllice that of the ARRB . to cosure roady access to ossontial documentary

:
evidence. In the Board's case the essential evidence is any records relating to the assassination of |
President Keonedy. In our cage essential evidance consists of all federal and presidential records
that document the rights of American citizens, the actions of federal officials, and the oational

experience. The Review Board needs the time designated in this bill to complete its important

work in making available as completo un historical record as possible oonceming the

June 4, 1997

Mr. Chairman, I am Steven D, Tilley, Chief ofthe Access and Freedom of Information Act Steff
of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). [wish to thank you for the
opportunity to testify today on behalf of NARA in support of H.R. 1553, which will extend the
authorization of the John F. Kennedy Astassination Records Review Board for one year to
September 30, 1998. I am appearing today in my capssity as NARA's Chief of the President John
F. Keanedy Assassination Records Collection. In that role I am charged with implemeating
NARA‘s responsibilities under the Act and I serve as NARA‘ liaison to the Assassination
Records Review Board (ARRB). This afternoon I would like to tell you a little bit of my
background concerning records of the ascassinatian nf Preaident Kennedy, explain the role of
NAXA in implementing the Act, and outline why the National Archives and Records

Administration supports passage of this important piece of legislation. *

Mr, Chairman, my career ae an archivist has involved working with some of the most sensitive
and highly classified recorde of our Government. [oversaw the closing of the office of the
Watergate Special Prosecution Furce (WSPF) and supervised tho tranafer of thece records to the

National Archives in 1977. I worked with the recorda of the WSPF for more than 11 years,
