Court, San Francisco, by JOE CERRITO, LCN Boss of the San .
Jose Family, against Life Magazine for an additional $7,000,000
Informant commented to FIGLIA that PETE MISURACA was probably

s replied “If you think PETE is unhappy, you should see JOE

  

(CERRITO), he's really sick,"

Informant said to MANNY "What do you mean, didn't he file
the new suit?" and MANNY replied "Yeah, but he didn't

want to. He's sick of the whole thing. He wanted to leave
Sleeping dogs lie, He doesn't want the money, all he wanted
was a retraction,"

PIGLIA then related that CERRITO and his wife,
during the past week, were guests at his home for a birthday
party. MANNY said "You should see that guy, he's so .
depressed and sick that he couldn't even eat a piece of
cake." FIGLIA commented that CERRITO's "wife and kid" are
“mad at JOE" for all of the trouble, particularly the adverse
; publicity and the loss of his dealership. The Informant
! told FIGLIA that he could not understand why CERRITO filed
a new libel suit if he wanted to forget the matter. MANNY
concluded the discussion by saying "You don't understand,
you don't understand". Informant added that he did not
press FIGLIA further for discussion on the matter, however,
it was his impression that someone convinced CERRITO to file
the most recent libel action against Life Magazine against
his wishes.
