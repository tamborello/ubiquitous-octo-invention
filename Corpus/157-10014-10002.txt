obviously was in'this case, because-he had been a Marine, and
had defected, officially defected to the Soviet Union, accord=-
ing to this message in 1959.

Mr. Johnston. We are operating with a.zerqx copy of the
message. But is that a copy of your signature ‘on the third
page? , :

Mr. Karamessines. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. And with that is it fair to establish
that you at least read the message and knew of the activity
on the date you read the message?

Mr. Karamessines. I read the message. And it concerns
a Marine defector to the Soviet Union who apparently, accord=
ing to the incoming message to which this was a response,
was trying to get in touch with some Soviets or Cubans in
Mexico. That would be the extent of my interest in it at the
time. And I would have ascertained that this certainly was
a legitimate interest of the CIA in an Ameriéan, as an ‘
exception to the general rule.

Mr. Johnston. Do you know of any operational interest
that the CIA had in Oswald?

Mr. Karamessines. No, never at any time to my knowledge.

Mr. Johnston. Were you aware that in the fall of 1963
the CIA took an interest in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee?

_ Mr. Karamessines. I didn't know that.

Mr. Johnston. Were you later aware of it?

Mr. Johnston. But you had no involvement in any ‘

contemplated action or operation?

foe
Mr. Karamessines. No, absolutely not.

Mr. Johnston. Were you knowledgeable of the CIA progarm

operations directed ggainst Cuba?

Mr. Karamessines. Generally, in very general terms, yes.

 

Mr. Johnston. And those were run by whom at the time

in the fall of 1963?

Mr. Karamessines. They had had the Bay of Pigs, the
previous year, right?

Mr. Johnston. No, 1961, April and May of 1961.

Mr. Karamessines. That is right, 1961. I don't know
whether the Cuban activity has been -- my recollection doesn't
permit me to say with assurance that the Cuban activity had
been transferred back, had been. transferrea to the WH Division,:
or if it continued to function as a special staff of some
kind, I don't recall. But it was one or the other.

Mr. Johnston. Was Mr. Fitzgerald the Head of the Cuban
Division?

Mr. Karamessines. He was at one time, yes, before he
became DP at one time, he was in charge, yes.

Mr. Johnston. And did he have a unit called the Special

Affairs Staff charged with Cuban operations?

Mexico city in-Septenber and early October of 1963, and CIA
surveillance there picked up the fact of his visit to the
Soviet Embassy.

And I want to show you Director Megaage Number 74830
of 10 October 1963. Principally I am interested in the. fact
that on the third page of that you are the authenticating
Officer. And I will give you a chance to perruse the message.

Mr. Karamessines. Actually I am the releasing officer.

Mr. Johnston. You are the releasing officer?

Mr. Karamessine. That is right. I don't know who some
of the other people here are, because their names are not
listed. The only name that has been left on here is my name
as releasing officer, right?

Mr. Johnston. Right. Then the originating unit is
what on that message?

Mr. Karamessine. WH-3, Mexico.

Mr. Johnston. What you your capacity be as reviewing
officer of that message?

Mr. Karamessines. To make sure that it wasn't violating .
any particular policies of ours, particularly since it was
dealing with a man who at least had been American, and might
atill be an American. And we were taking an interest in this
fellow even though he wasn't an American. And normally we

wouldn't do that, unless there was good reason -- as there
