we can only assume that those chronological compilations
which do exist were assembled and preserved solely because
of the assassination of the President and, none had an
earlier start date than 1 October 1963.

There is no electronic repository for cables and
dispatches from the stations. Once cables were printed out
they went to the addressee and then into specific files.

If you require anything further in this regard, please
advise.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Gunn:

Re: ARRB Request No. CIA 6, for Information
CIA Cable Traffic For Specific Periods

The following is responsive to referent request.

Via referent request, the ARRB asked for additional
information on cable traffic and dispatches between CIA
headquarters, Mexico City and JMWAVE. Specifically, the
staff asked that the Agency provide as a package all such
cables and dispatches for the periods 26 September through
20 October 1963, and 22 November through 30 December 1963.

As you know, within the sequestered collection, there
are several chronological dispatch/cable collections, but
the earliest that any of them commence is 1 October 1963.

In general cable traffic and dispatches are not available as
a chronological collection and thus, for the period 26
through 30 September 1963, it is not possible to provide
cables and dispatches in a chronological/package form.
During the periods in question, the Office of Communications
(OC) only held cables long enough to ensure that they were
successfully transmitted to the named recipient. On
occasion, because processes and resources required to
perform cleanup activity varied, cables were sometimes held
for longer periods but not with the intention of creating a
long-term reference collection.

In addition, the offices of record for the origination
of cable traffic and dispatches did-not create cable and
dispatch files for reference collection purposes. The
originating office maintained a temporary paper cable
chrono, usually retained for not more than ninety days.
Then, because this temporary chrono copy was not the
“official” or “record” copy, it was destroyed. Accordingly,

will discuss issues with CLA.

-HTLINGUAL. It is the Review Board staff's understanding that CIA continues
its search for HTLINGUAL records and will provide an oral briefing on the

subject. It is also our understanding that some HTLINGUAL records have been

located, but that they have not yet been made available to the Review Board.

Recent and. additional informal requests that we have discussed with you:

“Operational Reports for Cuban Exile Groups. The Review Board staff has been
~ unable to locate in the collection monthly operational reports for the DRE, CRC,

w “or MRR for the period between March 1963 and March 1964. Please advise us
-whether these records exist ‘and when we may review them.

Moscow. ‘CIA has been asked to search for additional information regarding

’ Mosco as discussed with Michelle Combs on October 24, 1996.

Tape. CIA has been asked to search for additional information regarding a tape

‘as discussed with Irene Marr on October 24, 1996.

Please let me know of any inaccuracies in this letter or any suggestions that you have.

RE: ARRB Additional Information Request No. CIA-6

Dear John:

As a part of our examination of the documentary record surrounding the assassination |
of President Kennedy, we would like to conduct a systematic review of cable and
dispatch traffic between the CIA's Mexico City station, CIA headquarters, and
JMWAVE during the period immediately surrounding Lee Harvey Oswald's visit to
Mexico City and the assassination of President Kennedy. It is our understanding that
although copies of many of the cables and dispatches are already in the Oswald and JFK
files, not all cables and dispatches are included.

We hereby formally request the CIA to assemble all of the cable traffic and dispatches

3 for the period September 26, 1963 through October 20, 1963 and November 22, 1963

‘through December 30, 1963 between: (a) the Mexico City station and headquarters, and
(b) the Mexico City station and JMWAVE.

Because it may be appropriate in the future for us to examine all similar traffic between
CIA headquarters and JMWAVE during this period, would you please provide us with
your best reasonable estimate of the amount of time and effort that would be entailed in
assembling cables and dispatches between headquarters and JMWAVE for the same
period identified above?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,

Ck ¢ uh
