Assassination Records Review Board
Second Floor

Dear Mr. Marwell:

By letter dated March 3, 1995, I provided comments on
behalf of the FBI regarding the Assassination Records Review
Board's (the Board) proposed regulation containing guidance on
the interpretation of the term "assassination record" and
"additional information and records" included in the "President
John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992"
(the Act). Inspector Terry T. O'Connor discussed those FBI
comments at the Board's public meeting in Washington, D.c., on
Tuesday, March 7, 1995. This letter sets forth additional
comment suggested by Mr. O'Connor's dialogue with the Board and
other discussion at the meeting last Tuesday.

During the public meeting, the Board, through
Mr. O'Connor, invited the FBI's attention to language in
Subsection (a) of Section 1400.1 of the proposed regulation.
That Section provides assistance in the interpretation of the
term "assassination record." The specific language discussed was
that involving records relating to "activities and events that
may have led to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy."
As Mr. O'Connor told the Board, the FBI had no concern with this
language at the time of my March 3 letter and believes that the
Board would provide a reasonable basis for requesting records

covered by this terminology. bAc- Noh Vos - 144

bep. Di Based on all the discussion at the Board meeting in
Chiet 1 regard to the language referred to above, the FBI wishes to
oniga Supplement its earlier comments by suggesting that language be

Counsel,

- Mr. Collingwood
