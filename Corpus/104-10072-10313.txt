goals and that he would be well advised to look into the activities of these
people and contacts, since they were undoubtedly involved in subversion and
using their jobs and assistance to the FMG as a cover for their real aims,
HREOLLY/8 was aroused and said that he would definitely get onto this matter.
He then volunteered that a "Carmichael" had been in Lagos a few months ago ©

t ( tthen told him that this was a case in point and that if
any system of monitoring these people he could help us run down kndwn

our country. . : :

 

   

  

4, As noted above, KRHOLLY/8 seemed eager and willing to assist, but
it is dubious that he will be able to make any real progress on his own or
convince his superiors to make a concerted and formal effort to provide us
with the information we would like to have, especially the follow-up locally
of the activities of MACHAOS people when they arrive and start moving around
town. However, the initial reaction was positive and perhaps if we keep
plugging away, we can make a break-through in this area.

involved with MHCHAOS target personalities. Our records indicate the Charge’
at the present time is: James Duro Olufemi SOKOYA; born 1933 at Ojows,
iebu-Igbo; one of ten Nigerians to attend a course for diplomats (Interna-
tional law and French lessons) in Geneva, based on a bilateral program for
technical assistance. SOKOYA was Assistant Chief of Protocol before his
present assignment and, according to the LNCUFF Assistant Political Officer,
was very friendly and helpful to LNCUFF. :
