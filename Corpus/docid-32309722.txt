course of regular investigation by Special Agents JOSEPH I.
GREALY, DENNIS J. O'SHEA and JOSEPH ZIEGLER,

A. ORGANIZED GANGS

Investigation and contacts with informants and
sources of information have failed to give any indication
that there are any organized gangs in Broward County at the
present time,

On November 15, 1956, MM 322-C advised that neither
MEYER LANSKY, FBI No. 791783, nor VINCENT ALO have been in
Hollywood, Florida, during the past six months. He indicated
that ALO has become more alligned with activities in New York

since the deportation of JOE ADONIS to Italy. Informant -
stated that JACK LANSKY has made brief appearances at his - 4

home in Hollywood, Florida, but has spent most of his time in
Havana, Cuba, where the LANSKY syndicate is active in gambling
operations.

On November 16, 1956, MM 322-C advised that SAMUEL
LAWRENCE BRATT, FBI No. 5036886, returned to Hollywood,

Florida, from Las Vegas, Nevada, during the electionp-primaries

.D, POLICE EFFICIENCY

Ss H.> LEROY ALLEN is Chief of Police and his department
consists of some fifty-five men, The Detective Bureau has

been headed in the past by ALVA G, LAYNE, but LAYNE
.vetired as of November 1, 1956 and a ‘successor has not

yet been appointed,

Public reaction to the efforts of the police has
become more favorable, but all seem to agree that there is
room for much improvement. Chief ALLEN has held several
police schools during the past three years and the FBI
participated in each of these schools. ALLEN is interested
in promoting police efficiency, but lacks organizational
ability and does not hold full respect of his men. There
are several different factions within the department, each
trying to get their own man in a key position,

The Daytona Beach Police Department and the
Volusia County Sheriff's Office and the troopers of the
Florida Highway Patrol in this area are most cooperative
with FBI and go all out to aid er assist the Bureau in
its work. . ;
