The afore-mentioned company was doing well financially before
“Allegheny County, Pa., authorities raided establishments where
the machines had been':placed and forced the company out of
business. Although each of the afore~mentioned individuals
owned an equal share in the company, SAMUEL ‘MANNARINO and

LA ROCCA obviously usurped the most authority and held my
meetings at which important subjects were discussed in Italian,
“which MESSER did not understand. LA ROCSA used MESSER only -

for proven protection methods and MESSER did not mind as long

‘During the late 1930's and early 1940's, the Italian element
at. Pittsburgh, Pa., had a great fear and respect of indivi-
duals known as -"blackhanders" and later LA ROCCA, who was,

to all intents and purposes a leader in this type of operation.
SEBASTIAN. JOHN LA ROCCA came into the area from the. James- -

’ town, New York, vicinity where he had been engaged in ; ;
moonshining operations bringing him into. Pittsburgh on a scheduled

VI. Origin of the Interest of La Rocca in Racketeering |

and Steps Leading to ont Position and | Activities

‘in Racketeering Matters

GEORGE ‘MESSER, who has been engaged in numbers writing
activity since about 1928, was once depended upon by

Pittsburgh racketeers for protection purposes because he.
“knew tocal and State police figures. LA ROCCA was one of

the individuais who utilized MESSER in this regard, He

became acquainted with LA ROCGA in about 1941 oF. 1942 when

LA ROCCA was handling all the numbers activity in the East
Liberty section of Pittsburgh and had set himself up as a
"little god," When LA ROCCA became dissatisfied with his’

- financal gains, he left Pittsburgh on a trip te Chicago to

   

snds about paste reel machines with which hé felt.
imake more money. A paste reel was.similar to a

_"@ne-armed bandit" with the exception that a small paper-

wrapped mint was dispensed as the coin. was placed in the
slot and the play was registered.

While LA ROCCA was. in'Chicago, MESSER moved into the East.

Liberty section and took over the entire Mumbérs_ operation.

When -LA ROCCA returned to Pittsburgh he became angry with
MESSER and had’ someone drive a car over, him one night as
he was crossing a street. Because ‘he thought: he would make
money in the East Liberty section, MESSER stayed in the
business of writing numbers - and actually forced LA ROCCA |
out of this business.

In. about 1943: MESSER and LA RCCCA became friendly and
LA ROCCA invited MESSER to share equally with him in the

. ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company which

later set up offices ‘at 5746 Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh.
LA ROCCA managed to raise enough money to put up his share
for the business and MESSER personally traveled to Chicago.
to arrange for the purchase of machines to be. distributed |
by this company. These machines ‘were placed throughout the

- East Liberty, Homewood, and Garfield sections of | Pittsburgh

and were heavily taxed by both the Government and the city
of Pittsburgh. Other owners of the afore-mentioned company,
in addition to MESSER and LA ROCCA were FRANK AMATO,

BARNEY. MC ‘GINIEY, ‘SAMUEL MANNARINO, and. F. W. ZOGG.
