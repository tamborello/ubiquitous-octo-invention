 

LIFEAT
Project LIFEAT began in 1951 as a unilateral teltap
operation, starting with a single tap against the Soviet Legation
and, as of mid 1962, covered as many as 30 lines in a given month:
. During the period August thru October 1963, 24 lines were covered.
Project LIFEAT ceased to provide coverage of the entire
Soviet official installation in June 1960 when the jointly run
project LIENVOY assumed that responsibility. This left LIFEAT free
to concentrate on ‘suspected individuals and targets of interest ,
solely to the U.S.G., i.e. Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents/
intelligence operatives resident in Mexico City whose activities
were of operational or counterintelligence interest; the project
was not designed to provide positive intelligence information.
Although coverage of the official Soviet and Satellite and Cuban
installations became a joint operation with the Mexican government,
via LIENVOY, the LIFEAT project remained available to resume
‘coverage of those installations if necessary.
During the summer of 1962, a review of the project indicated

a growing need for increased. CI/CE coverage of selected targets.

LIFEAT (KDMANGO), Unilateral Teltaps

provided coverage of: targets of special interest to the
Station (see list attached to correspondence).

the joint teltaps under LIENVOY covered the Soviet and.

Cuban official installations, leaving LIFEAT free and awtailable .

to concentrate on targets of CI/CE (ops etc) interest.

In considering whether or not CIA "did its job" the Project
provided the FBI with information on the leftist activities

of U.S. citizens in Mexico, and remained available to service -
other targets if an when requested to do so.
