By William Safire _

WASHINGON, Nov. fo—on Oct. 10,-
1963, the then-Attornéy General of the
‘United States put his personal signa-
dure on a documepit that launched and
| iegitimatized one of the most horren-
| dous abuses of Federal police power in
this century.

Ja Senator Frank Church’s subcom-
mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and  subse-
quent unauthorized bugging and at-
‘empted blackmailing of Martin Luther
ding Jr. is being gingerly examined,
with the “investigation” conducted in
such a way as not to unduly em-
| barrass officials of the Kennedy or
Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has
. focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, when*
the committee counsel first set forth

the result of shuffling through press
clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-{
partment had existed in 1962; today,”
an F.BJ. witness pointed out that it
was Robert Kennedy who authorized
the wiretap of Dr. King, and that “the

President of the United States and the

Attorney General specifically discussed

their concern of Communist influence

with Dr. King.”

' But the Church committee showed
no zest for getting further to the Ken-
‘nedy root of this precedent to Water-
gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church
were willing to let the chips fali where

' they may, he would call some knowl-
edgeable witnesses into the glare of
the camera lights and ask them some
questions that have gone unasked for
thirteen years,

For example, he could eail Nicholas
Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-
nedy’s deputy and successor, and ask
what he knows of the Kennedy de-
cision to wiretap Dr, King. Who at

_ Justice concurred in the recommenda-
tion? How does the F.B.1. know the }
President was consulted or informed?

After Mr. Katzenbach assumed of-
fice, and the wiretapping continued, «

he was told by angry newsmen that
. the F.B.L was leaking scurrilous in-
‘formation about Dr. King. Why did he

wait for four months, and for a thou-
sand telephonic interceptions, to dis«
continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sort af testimony
would erode Senator Church’s political
base. That is why we do not see for-
mer Assistant F.B.I. director Cartha
(Deke) Deloach, Lyndon Johnsen’s
personal contact with the F.B.I. in the
witness chair, What did President
Johnson know abuut the character-
assassination plot and when did he
know it? What conversations tool
place between bis, Deloach and Presi-

‘dent Johnson on the tipping of Dr.

King, or about the use of the F.BJ. in

avy other intrusions into the lives of

Pek L BS? ora: 32989786

 

  

   
   

 

@ Cover-Up
Ree ree ease
The committee is not asking embar-

rassing questions even when answers

are readily available. A couple of

_weeks ago, at an open hearing, an

F.B.I. man inadvertently started to

blurt out an episode about newsmen

who were weritapping in 1962 with
the apparent knowledge of Attornert

General Kennedy. The too-willing wit-

ness was promptly shooshed into sir

lence, and told that such informatiot
would be developed only in executive
session. Nohody raised an eyebrow.

That pattern ot containment by the
Church committee is vividly shown by

the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican and Democratic con-.

ESSAY

ventions which were ordered by Lyn-
don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-
cal headquarters were worse than the
crime committed at Watergate, since
they involved the use of the F.B.L,
but the Church investigators seem to
be determined! not to probe too deeply.

If F.B.1. documents say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why are those men not given the
same opportunity to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent’s men? If Lyndon Johnson com-
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the F.B.I. to spy on political 4
opponents, who can be brought for-”
ward to tell us all about it? 4

But. that would cause embarrass:
ment to Democrats, and Senator
Church wants to embarrass profes-
sional employees of
agencies only. A: new sense of Con-
gressional decorum exists, far from
the sense of outrage expressed in the
Senate Watergate committee’s hear-
ing room. When it is revealed that the
management of NBC News gave press
credentials to L.B.J.’s spies at the [964
convention, everybody blushes dernure-;
fy—and nobody demands io know;
which network executive made what!
decision under what pressure. q

I have been haranguing patien
readers for years about the doubje
standard applied to Democratic afd ~
Republican political crimes, and F ad
hoped the day would come wher’ the
bardbaii precedents set by the ,Ken-
nedy ard Inknson men would be laid
before the public in damning detail.

Obviously. Demecrat Frank Church
is not the man to do it, His. jowl-
shaking indignation is all teo selec-
tive; the trail of high-level responsi-
bility tor the cvimes committed against
Dr. King and othe’s is evidently going
to be ailowed to ecol.

Pity, You'd thinit that after ali the
nation kas been trrougs in the past
faw years, our political leaders would
have learned that tne one thing vhat
brings yore down is uie act of cover-
