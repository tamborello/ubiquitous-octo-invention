assassination to determine whether the intercept might
have been sent through and eventually reached the

there was such a message that was received but was not
sent to NSA to distribute, that he was not sure whether
they had considered the possibility that the message had
gone through to the proper authorities.

being involved in the assassination. Sqt. Stevenson

could only be arranged through the Department of
