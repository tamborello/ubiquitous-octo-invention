ALPIzaR's escellent cooperction with this office im L963,
and up to this time, would indicate that he is stable and
velleble,

; . As the Bureau is aware, the activities of Cuban
vevolutionary organizations are “Srequently spontaneous
and unpredictable, They da not follow the set pattern
usually common .to other netionelicy groups a nd te the ;
Communist Party. A Ciuban revolutionary group may be formed -
to carry out only one or two operations, and then cease to
exist, ¢ consequently, it is necessary for this office to

act with dispatch in placing appropriate coverage on a par~
tieuler organization which is planning @ raid.

 
  

 

 
    

: it is felt that Bureau regulations and policy
relative to development of informants and investigation of
these cases should be applied with sufficlent fhexibility
to produce maximum results. ~

BOSCH has told ALPIZAR he plans to use the boat in

ALPIZAR doubts the value of any such raid as planned
BOSCH. He also has confidence in the FBI and believes
duty to cooperate,

         

 
 

In order for ALPIZAR to acquire this information _.
he has’ to associate with BOSCH at the expense of neglecting — :
his personal a¥fairs, He is in the business of repairing — |
air conditioners and other electrical equipment. He also

gives private flying lessons. He has gotten behind in some Lo
of his expences, and faces Loss of his telephone service.
He will be unable to continue close association with BOSCH
at this critical time unless he can be compensated for his :
loss of time. |

      
         
           
    

This office, to date, has paid him a total of
$350.00 out of a total $400.00 authorized by the Bureau. '
‘An additional $50.00 will be paid to him 3/27/64, which will |

 

exhaust the current authorization.

Alpizar already has proved his productivity and
reliability. His position with BOSCH is unique because of
his gue bev seations as a pilot anc a veteran of previous raide,
It is because of his background as a man of. action and ad~
ventures chat pe is able to cultivate the confidence of
BOSCH, Mien feels these Cosreccensscses should be regarded
as an advantage in assessing him as a PSI. .
