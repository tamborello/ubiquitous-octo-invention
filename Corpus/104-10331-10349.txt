FBI INFORMANT/CONFIDENTIALITY POSTPONEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

This document will address the postponement practices
of the FBI relating to informants and others. with whom the FBI
has a confidential relationship (informant/confidentiality
postponements) in documents being transferred to the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) under the “President
John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992"
(the Act). To provide a basis for the formulation of these ~
practices, their description will be preceded by a discussion of
the classes of persons protected by an understanding of ,
confidentiality, as well as the development, operation, :
protection, and investigative significance of such persons.
Other determinations underlying these practices will -also be
addressed. The information contained in thig document’ £8 based
not only on the experience of the FBI and law*enforcement. and
intelligence communities in general, but on the personal ~
investigative experiences of some of the contributors to it.

CLASSES OF CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS

The FBI maintains a confidential relationship with
several types of persons. They include:

1. Criminal Informants who provide information
regarding criminal activity, including organized crime, white
collar crime, violent crime, drug trafficking, and, today,

' domestic terrorism. All such individuals are now assigned

identifying symbol numbers (to be described hereafter) to protect
their-identities in documents containing information they have
provided. However, before and at the time of the Assassination,
and for some years thereafter, the names of the persons under
development as informants (Potential Criminal Informants or PCIs)
were reflected in documents until their reliability could be
established and they were converted to Criminal Informant (CI) a
status. Upon conversion to CI status the informant was assigned
an identifying symbol number for protection.

There are a number of subgroups within the criminal
informant program. While some CIs are considered general
criminal informants, others are categorized according to the
specialized area in which they provide information. These would
include, for example, Organized Crime (OC) informants, who
provide information primarily regarding subjects involved in
organized crime. activity, and Top Echelon informants (TE), who
provide information regarding the highest levels of organized
crime. .

From the time a person comes under development as an
informant (in previous years as a PCI), he or she is made the
subject of an individual file. This file contains information

Mr. David G. Marwell

Ten of the above record systems do not concer the investigative area. The five
record systems of an investigative nature, but not relevant to the assassination, are 001(NCIC),
009 (FIRS), 015 (NCAVC), 016 (CIS), and 017 (NDIS). Information from these records~’
systems is retrievable through index searches of each respective system. The JFKTF did not
search the indices of these systems, since they were not applicable at the time of the assassination
or the related investigations. In addition, record systems 003 through 005, 007, 008, and 010
through 014 were not relevant to the Act since they are internal FBI systems such as the payroll, .
the handling of Bureau mail, health records, and other noninvestigative administrative matters,
involving Bureau employees. The two systems of records relevant to the Act and searched by the
FBI were 002 Central Records’ System (CRS) and 006 Electronic Surveillance Indices (ELSUR).

The following information will explain the FBI's system. of. recording, filing, and
retrieving ents at the FBI. The FBI's primary records repository is its CRS, which pas
automated beginning in 1978. ‘The old manual card index of the CRS-was maintained, since the
automation did not encompass all of the old records, The FBI maintains the CRS for its
investigative, personnel, applicant, administrative, and general files. Although the FBI has other
tecord systems as explained above, the CRS is the primary and most important system for
retrieving assassination related records. It consists of a numerical sequence index of subject
matter files and an alphabetical index to these files called the general index.

The FBI's filing system follows s numbering method used to show (1) the
classification or type of investigative violation or administrative area involved, (2) the individual
case file within the category, and (3) the serialization of individual documents commonly called,
pieces of mail, in the file. Once a violation defines the classification, then the case portion of the
file nurnber is assigned by subject. For instance, the number 91-200-20 on a piece of mail says it
is the 20th piece of mail in the 200th case file assigned to the bank robbery 91 classification.
This example would not be correct for the newest segment of files in the automated indices, che
Universal Case File (UCF) which was established in November 1991. However, the FBI's EK
collection of Glzs aad docuraents known at this point co not fall within the UCF system.

Each classification maintains a zero (0) and a double zero (00) file. The 0 and 00
files are "general files" and precede the first case file in each classification. The 0 file is used for
complaints and miscellaneous nonspecific data relating to the classification that does not warrant
establishing a separate case file. The 00 file is used for collecting, in one place, policies and
procedures that refer to the particular classification or violation category. The FSI files each
document conceming policy and procedure serially in the 00 file of the appropriate classification.
Therefore, every time a change in policy, procedure, instruction, oz guideline occurs; itis
documented in this category, with the information veiag placed i in the 00 Gis.

The FRI's indexing of the CRS general indices falls i into two separate categories,
. “Main” and “Cross” references, A Main index reference carries the name of an individual,
organization, activity, or the like which is the primary subject of the file maintained in the

FBI CORE FILES AND ASSASSINATION RELATED FILES

Enclosure C contains the list of subjects and a summary of the files collected and

identified in 1992 as the John F. Kennedy (JFK) Assassination Core Files and Related Files as

prepared for Director Sessions’ statement. The summary was presented to Congress asan
explanation of the pages processed under the FOIPA and available to the public in the FBIHQ's
FOIPA Reading Room. Research about how the universe of files known as “Core-and Related,”
were grouped and titled did not produce a precise definition. A review of tickler notes related to
the FOIPA requests suggests that the group of files identified as ‘ ” was collected to ) respond
to FOIPA requests received in 1976 for files on the assassination, The group of fil as
“Related” seemed to have been established due to additional FOIPA requests and appeals for files
associated with the assassination. The John F. Kennedy Task Force (JFKTF) could not find any
documentation when the term of “Core and Related” was initiated.

FBIRECORDS SYSTEM

The FBI currently maintains seventeen record systems, The Privacy Act requires
that every type of record system used by a government agency be disclosed to the public. The
following is the list of records explained in the Federal Register (Enclosure D).

001. The National Crime Information Center (NCIC).
002. Central Records System (CRS).
003. The Bureau Mailing Lists.
004. Routine Correspondence Handled by Preprinted Form.

. system, All the documents created for a subject involving a particular violation will be filed in
that particular subject’s main file. A Cross index reference contains only a mention or reference
to a particular individual, organization, activity, or the like found in the body of a document ina
file on another main subject. The case agent or records specialist indexes the cross reference, so
the information can be found later when it may be significant. :

The FBI also maintains the ELSUR Index that contains the names of persons
whose voices have been monitored through an FBI microphone installation or a telephone
surveillance, This index consists of three categories of information: Principals (Targets) of an
electronic surveillance; Proprietary Interests; and Overhears. The.FBI initiated the ELSUR index
at the recommendation of the Department of Justice. The index covers the electronic surveillance
sought by or conducted by the FBI since January 1, 1960. This index was automated in ( October
1991. Unlike the CRS, the FBI automated the entire indices, so only one search i is necessary,

For the FBI to ensure that all the documents mandated by the Act were found, the
IFKIF requested those specifically trained in the record systems to conduct searches of both the
automated and manual CRS indices and the automated ELSUR index. The search included all
the core and related subjects as defined in Enclosure C. The searches were conducted at FBIHQ
and in the Field and Legat Offices. The FBI record specialists assigned to this task employed the
normal procedures for searching all the relevant indices to respond to the Act.. Their appropriate
supervisors approved the work.

. . The House Select Committee on Assassination (SCA); was a Congressional
Committee established to review possible theories of the assassinations conceming President
John F. Kennedy and the Reverend Martin Luther King. The JFKTF identified the universe of _
files known as the “HSCA Files” by reviewing the HSCA request letters, the FBI response letters,
administrative folders and copies of the files shown to the HSCA staff. The copies of the HSCA
files and folders were segregated at the end of the Committee's investigation due to an agreement
with the Committee. The JFKTF identified the HSCA Field Office ELSUR documents _
conceming the requested subjects by using the same records previously mentioned.

; Conceming the Board's requests involving “JUNE MAIL,” “Do Not File“
memoranda, “informant files,” “personnel files" and “COINTELPRO activities,” the information
in those categories, if maintained as records, are indexed and filed in the CRS. Therefore, the
universe of assassination records searched for and collected would include any documents with
the above notations. At FBIHQ, sensitive records requiring restricted access are maintained in
the Special File Room (SFR) which is a repository for sensitive records. In the Field Offices the
sensitive documents are also maintained in spécial areas, such as the SACs Safe. All :
assassination related records that the FBI maintains in the secure areas are also retrievable
through the systems searched. The FBI used these systems to search all areas for indexed and
retrievable records.

FBI RECORDS STORAGE FACILITIES ;
"For storage of records outside FBI space, the FBI Headquarters uses two off-site
facilities. One location is Pickett Street in Alexandria, Virginia. This facility contains most of
the FBI's closed files that were previously housed at FBIHQ at 10th and Pennsylvania Avenue,
Washington, D.C. Thé other off-site facility is in Boyers, Pennsylvania. This location houses<::.
FBI Legat information. The Legat information at Boyers, is also on "Microfilm" at FBIHQ. The -
only additional records maintained at the Boyer's location consist of National Lawyers Guild files
that are “Court Sealed" records. The Boyers, Pennsylvania records’ storage area is rented by the
FBI from the National Underground Storage Company.

addition, the field offices have three official off cite storage facilities. These
facilities are lotated at Butte, Montana; Pocatello, Idaho; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. All three
locations have archival disposition offices to decide the handling of closed files, but all decisions
are forwarded to FBIHQ’s archival office for final approval. All FBI Field Offices and FBI
Legats send information requiring “record-keeping” to FBIHQ.

FBI RELEASES TO ©
NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION (NARA)

Enclosure E depicts all releases made to NARA from the first release on
‘December 13, 1993, to the 16* release on December 20, 1996. A special note is made that the
total number of pages since 1992 has expanded from 236,000 pages to more than 666,000 pages
made available to the public. This includes the re-processing of all core and related files. -
according to the Act, The FBI has developed a plan with the Board’s staff to streamline this
process, The change will cause an initial delay for the next release, but eventually the releases
will occur more often and with fewer postpanements.

FBI RESPONSES TO SPECIFIC REQUESTS

Throughout the process of responding to the Board's specific numbered requests
the JFKTF staff is in frequent contact with employees of the Board. The Board has also
requested information from our records concerning other areas that may have some relation to the
assassination. The memoranda from the Board to the FBI indicate that the FBI has addressed
both written and oral requests from the Board, Where there are no specific written responses
from the FBI to the Board, the FBI either handled these responses orally with members of the
staff or is in the process of responding. The JFKTF prepared an inventory of the requests and
status of responses and shared this information with the Board. However, the responses to the
numbered letter requests will be documented later.
