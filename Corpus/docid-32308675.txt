five photographs he took at the concert in Dallas given by the
Komitas Quartet on 1/30/63, Three of the photographs were long
shot views in the auditorium of that quartet, one including the -
composer (EDWARD MIRZOYAN) taking a bow. One photograph was of

"Dallas Morning News," daily newspaper, Dallas, Texas) and LEV ARONSON,
masician, Dallas. The other photograph was of Mrs, JOHN ROSENFIELD

Mr. BROUNOFF, on 2/1/63, advised SAS GRANDY and KUYKENDALL
that in his discussion with SERGAY ASLAMAZIAN, cellist, BROUNOFF
inquired about his uncle named PLATON BROUNOFF, his uncle who had
come to the United States years ago from Russia. He also mentioned
to ASLAMAZIAN that PLATON BROUNOFF had another brother who may still
be in Russia. -ASLAMAZIAN replied that he does not know the name
PLATON BROUNOFF but the name BROUNOFF sounds familiar to him because
there is a famous actor in Russia with the last name of BROUNOFF.
BROUNOFF stated that he gave ASLAMAZIAN his and his wife's (RUTH G.
BROUNOFF) names and his address,

BROUNOFF advised that if he-should receive any correspon-
dence or otherwise hear from this person or anyone else from Russia,
he would notify the Dallas Office. \ : ;

identifiable data concerning DAVID WINTERRY and his wife, VIVIENNE
TALLAL WINTERRY, No investigation was conducted by the Dallas, -
Office concerning WINTERRY and his wife in 1946, except that/$}ow2
those two reports. (This data is mentioned because Mr, ZELMAN

a sister named VIVIAN who lives in New York City and who planned

investigation was made concerning BARTRAM KELLEY, who is referred
to in the enclosed memorandum, That preliminary investigation if
1954 was under the caption of 'BARTRAM KELLEY, aka, Albert Bartram
Kelley, Jr., Member, NACA Sub-Committee, National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics, Washington, D, C., SGE," Bufile 140-3270. . That
file reflects BARTRAM KELLEY's wife is DOROTHEA NOLTE KELLEY, At
that time, BARTRAM KELLEY was Chtef Engineer for the Helicoptor
Division of Bell Aircraft Corporation, Dallas, Texas, This appears
to be the same position he now holds, That preliminary investigation
developed insufficient investigation to warrant further inquiry.\ ,
