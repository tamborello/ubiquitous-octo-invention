For some time, it has been an (accepted sngfSagectsve
with SUE FRANK, who is thought t6 be the PLP’s link :

unsclicitated offer to introduce SUE FRANK tofAHC represent crsves Ts)
This comes at a time when New York sources have. ‘reported SUE _
SRANK has had some dispute with MILT ROSEN over an
ideclogical matter, possibly the PLP position on Soviet aid
to North Vietnam. The source of this information cannot be
econtected. ince this dispute, which took place three or
x months ago, there has been no. known contact between SUE
and MILT ROSEN, whereas previously they were in almost }

New York recommends we encourage LOMAN to arrange

   
 
 

 

the meeting with FRANK. If he does not succeed we still

cok better than if we try to avoid the meeting. IF the:

informants meet FRANK, they can acquaint her with (the AKC 6)
explain they seek no organizational tie with PLP for reasons
