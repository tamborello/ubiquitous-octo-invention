report, advised SA JOHN L. PUDDISTER as follows:

He has been treating members of the MANNARINO organization
for about seven years and would gladly furnish inf tion
concerning them and their activities. the

is of the Roman Catholic faith, has also been called upon
many times to treat Priests and Nuns, with particular
reference to Mt. St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Freeport

Road, New Kensington, Pa., the parish to which the MANNARINOs
belong. Father FUSCO is Pastor of the parish, and his

chauffeur is JOHN_ST, is also a registered nurse.
Both have been patients at one time or another.
During the period in late 1958 that a subpoena was outstanding

for SAM MANNARINO's appearance before a Federal Grand Jury,
Pittsburgh, he was being hidden, part of the time, by Father
FUSCO on the third floor of the Apostulate House for Mt. St.
Peter's Roman Catholic Church. tocated at 204 Charles Street,
New Kensington. has: asked Father FUSCO on many
occasions not to assist the MANNARINOs, but Father FUSCO, a
"pure blooded Sicilian," has stated that the MANNARINOs are
his "boys" and that the Federal Government is persecuting
them for things which are quite legal in Italy. Father FUSCO
attended the coronation of Pope John XXIII, along with his
chauffeur, JOHN STANISH. STANISH has told |__| that
upon returning from Italy, Father FUSCO was me New York
City by ALBERT ANASTASIA's limousine and that they were
rushed through customs without an examination of luggage.
STANISH said they stayed a few days in ANASTASIA's home and
then returned to New Kensington. Approximately two weeks
later, ANASTASIA was shot to:death in New York City.

has said he will furnish medical, records on a confidentia

basis and will attempt to obtain a photograph of SAM MANNARINO,

jurisdiction of the FBI. Because there is still considerable ft
investigation to conduct in both above-named cases and an oy
because investigation in those cases in effect constitutes i
investigation of. the MANNARINO organization, it is felt. that
the interest of the Bureau will best be served by concentra-
tion on those cases. Therefore, UACB and only until initial
prosecutive action is completed, the Pittsburgh Office will
submit reports in instant matter every ninety days instead :
of the usual forty-five days. -
