Hoover had no memory of ever checking the
names of the following individuals:

1. Lee Harvey Oswald 3. Frank Church
2. Richard Nixon 4. Howard Baker

Hoover stated that occasionally she was also
asked to conduct checks on organizations. She
specifically remembered conducting checks on CORE
and SDS. She doesn’t think she ever did a check
on the Black Panther Party.

Hoover and Kuhnke were then asked whether,
to their knowledge, any information taken from the
biographic files at NSA had ever been supplied to
any person involved with operation CHAOS at the CIA.
Hoover stated that she did not know what operation
CHAOS was. However, Kuhnke stated that he did kno
the general nature of this operation. He stated
that he could not give a definite yes or no as to
whether this information had been supplied to that
operation, but that he "wouldn't be surprised" if
it had. He stated that he did not believe that an
research at NSA had specifically been initiated
because of operation CHAOS, but he believed that
the Counterintelligence Staff at NSA, which was
responsible for operation CHAOS, had levied certai
requests on the Office of Security at CIA for
information as to particular individuals. In .
supplying this information, the Office of Security
probably also supplied the information it had
received from NSA.

Kuhnke stated that shortly after he had
taken over in 1970, he began to feel that the
biographic files at NSA were not a valuable resourde
and he therefore issued informal instructions to
his staff that they should no longer bother using |
them. However, it was the responsibility of
individual supervisors in his office to determine
what procedures were to be used in checking parti-
cular names. He believe it was highly possible thdt
some of the supervisors continued to ask for
information from NSA.

Hoover and Kuhnke were asked why the CIA had PILE:
not decided to take NSA's US files when it took ove
the rest of the central information function for
the intelligence community. Hoover and Kuhnke said
they had participated in a meeting between various
persons from CIA and Robert Tracy and another perso
from NSA, where the conclusion was reached that thege
files were simply not of much value. Since CIA itsé¢lf
was cramped for storage space, CIA decided not to
take these files. Kuhnke stated, however, that CIA
would have made room for them if they hand't been
so old and basically useless. Hoover said that she
had been told "It was too much sand to sift for the
gold."" Kuhnke then stated that after these files
had been offered to the Office of Security at CIA,
they were offered to Division D. He said that it
was his understanding that Division D had refused
the files for the same reasons as the Office of
Security.

Both Hoover and Kuhnke both stated that absolutely
no information from NSA's files had ever been supplied
to any agency outside CIA. They said that this would
have violated the third agency rule.

WATCH LIST

Hoover stated that she had been asked "a coupl
of times" by someone at CIA, whose name she could
not remember, whether she knew anything about a
watch list at NSA. In fact, someone at CIA had onc
given her a specific name to be put on a watch list
Hoover said that she spoke with Robert Tracy of
C-5, and Tracy told her whom she should call to
put the name on’a watch list. However, Hoover cannot
remember who the person was that she was told to call
or even whether that person was in C-5 or in the
operational side of NSA. Hoover said that she had
never heard of project MINARET, but that she had
heard about NSA watch lists while working in DDP.

INTERVIEW WITH: Mabel Hoover and Ervan Kuhnke.
Office of Security, CIA

DATE-TIME-LOCATION: Offices of the Committee on
July 25, 1975 at 10:00 AM

PRESENT: Hoover, Kuhnke, and Eric Richard (SSC)

The main purpose of this interview was oy
originally to speak with Hoover, who from November
1960 until June 1973 worked full time at the
National Security Agency in the files maintained
by the part of that organization known as C-5.
However, since she was accompanied by her immediate
superior, Kuhnke, who has been her supervisor since
1970, he was also asked and responded to a number
of questions.

  
  
  

Hoover stated that her job at NSA had been to
conduct name checks using the biographic files.
From 1960 to 1964, Hoover was on the payroll of
DDP, now DDO, of the CIA. Specifically, she was
employed by Staff (now Division) D. In 1964,
Hoover was transferred to the payroll of the Office
of Security. However, in the 1960-1964 period she
spent about half her time doing work for DDP and about
half for the Office of Security. After 1964, she spent
most of her time doing Office of Security work, but
occasionally handle a request from DDP. The work done for
DDP was a "courtesy."

Both before and after 1964, Hoover was
occasionally asked to compile biographic information
on U.S. citizens. She was never given the reasons
why the information was needed. Occasionally, these
lists would include more than just names: they
would specifically ask for information concerning
involvement with particular political organizations,
foreign travel, and particular individuals outside the
United States.

Before 1964, Hoover's immediate superior was
at first one Frances Sherman, who has since married
and no longer is employed by CIA. Later in the pre-
1964 period, Sherman was replaced by one Daniel J.B.
Biermann, who is an attorney (apparently now
working for the Veterans Administration), and who
now lives in Potomac, Maryland. After 1964, and
until 1970, Hoover's superior was one Adele Iulianna
(spelling uncertain). In 1970 Kuhnke took over.

Hoover stated that when she first began work
for CIA at NSA, three other CIA personnel were already
working there. In 1964, this number was reduced to

one (Hoover). Hoover did not know the reason

why the number of personnel working at NSA had been
reduced, but stated that she had been told that it
was because "there were now other means of doing th
same operation at CIA."

FILE:

Hoover stated that she had totally free access

to all the C-5 files, except for a couple of
cabinets that were kept locked. She recalled these
as relating to movements of East Germans, and to
mainland Chinese matters. However, Hoover stated
that the key to these files would usually be left
lying around in an ashtray, or otherwise be availabl
on an informal basis. She simply had to tell someo
‘she was going to use it.

NSA exercised absolutely no supervision over
Hoover's access to, or use of the information in,
the biographic files. The information that she
retrieved was sent back to CIA by armed courier.

No one at NSA cleared its release before it left

NSA. Hoover stated that no one even asked her why

she needed any particular information. The materials

sent out to CIA by Hoover might consist of copies,
summaries, or just reference to document numbers ap earing
on documents in the biographic files. Hoover also
prepared short biographies in her own words on the

basis of the information she retrieved.

Hoover was asked whether she remembered seeing
any FBI documents in the biographic files. She
said that she did, and that these were generally
"reports .on individuals. “However, she did not think |
that they included any arrest records.

Hoover seemed to have an astonishingly good
memory of the names that she had checked, once
specific possibilities were suggested to her. She
seemed to have no doubt whatsoever that she had
conducted checks on the following names:

Stokley Carmichael
William Sloane Coffin
Rennie Davis

Jerry Rubin

. Abe Hoffman

Leslie Bacon ( and persons associated with her)
Sirhan Sirhan

James Earl Ray
Benjamin Spock

Roy Wilkins
