I note the "Mongoose" reference, a basic actual comment.
I also note the “golden boy" reference. Someone may have referred
to the man that way, but it was not a categorization in general use.
Makes interesting reading but is more literary than reliable, for
the impression it conveys. Further, jt indicates a tie we feel
should be protected. .
