MEMORANDUM

- SUBJECT : Garrison Investigation of

“Kennedy Assassination:
Donald P, (or T.) NORTON

“15 On. 6 August 1967 we were informed that the Vancouver
(Canada) Sun was running or soon would run an interview. with one
Donald P. (or T.) NORTON, 35 years eld, who had made ‘the —
followiag claims. : .

a. That he was-a CLA man and that in 1958 he

delive red.$150,.000 to David FERRIE for transfer

_ to Cuba. (Comment: David W. FERRIE, now dead,
was a pilot living in New Orleans, District Attorney
James C, Garrison has claimed that FERRIE was
one of a small group of conspirators who master-
minded the assassination of President Kennedy.
‘Alicgations that CIA employed FERRIE have appeared
in print, Thorough checks have shown that there
was no association between FERRIE and this Agency.)

b. That in 1962 Clay SHAW gave NORTON an
attache case containing $50,000 which NORTON de-
livered to one Harvey Lee in Monterrey, Mexico.
(Comment: There is no evidence that Lee Harvey
Oswald was in Mexico in 1962, There is no evidence,
except the unsupported word of a criminal and drug
addict, that Clay SHAW knew Oswald, SHAW is the
orily person indicted by Garrison to date on the charge
of conspiring to kill President Kennedy.)

$2, 500 for that described in sub-paragraph b,

: Vancouver. Sun Sun containing the article herein described. However, -:

. C/E/BG/C is a is algo f quested: to ask to try to get a-
copy for us, either independently or through Haison. lio-le

3._AMl pertinent Agency records haye been checked, There is
no record of a Donald P. NORTON or Donald T, NORTON. Thereis —
also no record of a. Donald NORTON who matches any of the foregoing .

; information,

4, The C/E/BC/C is also requested to obtain available informa-
tion from liaison regarding NORTON's general character and reputation
for veracity. Because District Attorney Garrison has made unfounded
charges that CIA and the FBIare interfering in his investigation in New
Orleans, inquirtes to liaison should be low-key. It is requested that no
reference be made to Garrison or his investigation, It is suggested that
the only reason given for our interest be that NORTON has made false
allegations that CIA employed him,

5. Itis -squested that a check be run in the files of WH/COG to
“gee whether Subject appears therein,
