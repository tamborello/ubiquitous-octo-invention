On September 8, 1953, LAWSON gave the nfhth in a series
of lectures on playwriting at 7410 Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood,
California, which is the office of the Hollywood Arts, Sciences
and Professions Council (ASP), which has been sponsoring this

series. CS LA 3738-S was present and subsequently furnished
SA BERNARR M. PTACEK with a written report of the meeting.

During the discussion period, the motion picture "Shane"
‘was brought up. LAWSON said that contrary to popular belief, this
-was not a "progressive" movie, even though a great many people
regarded it as such. According to LAWSON, it 1s not even a
socially significant picture. LAWSON maintained that the fact .
that SHANE took up arms when he did not believe in force and ;
taught. the little boy how to draw a pistol proved LAWSON's SS
contention that the entire point of the film was merely to oo.
engender an approval of war. . ;

 

: LAWSON went on to say, according to the informant's
report, that "of course violence is necessary and desirable when

'. LAWSON told the gathering that he was. one of the "10"
who went to jail "for disagreeing with the soelo-political powers
in’ this country" and for upholding what he believes are fundamental
rights. Heisaid, "As humanity moves forward, it must face and solve
new social problems."

: kes LA asizesf oes that JOHN HOWARD LAWSON continues fo)
be the do ant figure in the Hellywood ASP organization and one
who has’ a great deal to do with ASP decisions on all important
matters of policy. ae
