MEMORANDUM FOR: |C/WH/COG >
Attention . :| Miss Nancye Gratz /
SUBJECT ._—-:_: Cubans and the Garrison Investigation

1. As you know, Garrison continues to charge that a group

of anti-Castro Cubans employed by CIA participated in the assassination

of President Kennedy. The fact that he continues to publicize this
accusation is of course cause for concern. [You are also aware of the

 

memorandum by formerly stationed in Miami, the subject
. x ¥ J :

 

 

 

of which was "Possible DRE Animus Toward President Kennedy", This
memorandum speculated about the possibility that CIA -associated Cubans
might have playeda part i in the assassination. /

van For these reasons we have reviewed our full file on the
Garrison case and have compiled a roster of all 47 Cubans who have been
linked te Garrison's case in any way to date. Fourteen of these have not
previously been reported to ) you by/CU/REA oe

3. Itis requested that full checks be run: against your ‘files, and
those of the [Miami Station against all names not so traced to date. It is

. suggested that you consider all Cubans who had any affiliation with CIA
from the point of view of known affiliations with Cuban exile groups and
-with each other, so that we are forearmed as well as possible before the

trial of Clay Shaw et al, with its attendant publicity, gets under way.
