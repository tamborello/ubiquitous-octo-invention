MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: EPSTEIN, Edward Jay

The Sunday Edition of THE NEW YORK TIMES of 6 June 1966 contained
the attached clipping "Warren Report on Assassination Challenged Again"
in which mention is made that VIKING PRESS is bringing out 15,000 copies
of a book based on a Cornell University Master's thesis "Inquest" by
Subject.

A search of Security Indices and sources available in the Agency
Library has been unproductive which is not surprising that EPSTEIN is
thirty-one years of age and must have spent about the last eight years
as a university student at Cornell and Harvard Universities.

The book has the name of an Agency employee who hasbeen concerned

with the Oswald case, namely Ray ROCG. Due te this surfacing of an
Agency employee Edward EPSTEIN and his sources are of importance to ths

Agency.
