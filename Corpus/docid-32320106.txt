maintain any tickler files or archived SAC material. Further, any
such information handled by the RAs: would be maintained in Headquarters

previously released to FBIHQ.

It is noted that the Automated Indices of the Dallas Division is an
index to all records created since 1986. The Resident Agencies as
a part of the Dallas Division do not maintain a separate records system.

A search of the Administrative files revealed no listing regarding
any of the listed individuals or the Assassination. Further, there
is a-listing for each RA individually. A review of these files determined
they regard administrative matters such as space, security, and executive
staff visits.
