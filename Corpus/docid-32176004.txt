(A) EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION - SAFETY POLICY FOR THE FEDERAL

: Safety Policy for the Federal Service. The purpose of such policy is to

| safeguard Federal employees from personal injuries, reduce cost of injuries,
eliminate waste of materials: and it is both humanitarian and practical. |

The policy seeks improvement concerning safety records. It includes the-
promotion of safe practices on and off duty and includes protection to visitors
to Government buildings, installations, parks, forests and other facilities.
The President nas urged Federal agencies to cooperate with State and

local ‘governments, management, labor, and safety organizations in developing
and applying safety standards responsive to any changing conditions and the
pace of technological progress.

Although the Bureau has maintained an effective and extensive
safety program’ for years, we must make every effort to reduce the number
of work-related injuries. You must stress accident prevention to all
employees curing periodic office conferences. Each injury sustained in
your office should be most carefully analyzed and if it appears it could have
been avoided, immediate steps should be taken so that such type of accident
will not recur. You and every member of your office should remain alert
to accident potentials daily and take positive steps to remove accident
hazards. You should give this subject matter your personal attention and
make every effort to reduce the number of work-related injuries on a
continuing basis in the future. During periodic office inspections, your”
administrative file will be checked for compliance. “
