CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS
RELEASE IN FULL

4/3/97
Note for: John Pereira

Subject: Meeting with Marwell 4/2/97
Topics discussed:

1. Extension

Marwell says the extension request is going well. The
Board is fully funded in the President amended budget. He
does not see the need for a letter from CIA at this time;
may need one later for Congress.

2. Name issue

Marwell did not discuss the name issue with the Board;
their time was dominated by the Zapruder Film issue (the
open hearing was on CSPAN). He plans to include our
proposal as part of his “new approach” package. His pitch
to the board will be that the only way to complete the
review of the sequestered collection is to change the
current system. He will propose a comprehensive plan that
includes not only procedural changes (how we handle the
documents) but how substantive issues are addressed.

The “new approach” will be addressed at the April 23-24
meeting. We should have.a final memo to him prior to that
meeting. Marwell is re-reading the draft (copy attached)
today and may provide additional comments.

3. New “review” procedures
We have agree on the specific of the new procedures

including using number codes for substitute language. ARRB
staff will prepare a “test package” for next Board meeting.

4. Completion of Sequestered and Core collections

_ Marwell is telling the Board that with the new approach
they will be able to complete the review. He sees his staff
greatly increasing the amount of time they will be spending
on reviewing documents plus he plans hire additional people.
He asked if it would be possible to have a statement/letter
(MOA?) of commitment to completing the project by end of FY
1998. He was a little vague on what he had in mind,
however, it is clear he is concerned about completing the
review of the sequestered collection.

 

I told him that I believed the review of the
sequestered collection could be completed by October 1998 if
most of the “non-relevant” microfilm material is designated
NBR (not believed relevant) and we do not have to index each
document. However, I said we could not make the same
commitment to completing the “additional information /
records” requests and that these requests could slow down
the review of the sequestered collection.
