Memo, Lansdale to Harvey
“Liquidation of leaders."

"In compliance with the desires and guidance expressed
in the August 10 policy meeting on Operation Mongoose,
we will produce an outline of an alternate Course B
for submission."

"I believe the paper need contain only a statement of
objectives and a list of implementing activities. The
list of activities will be under the heading of:
Intelligence, Political, Eoonamic, Psychological, Para~
military, and Military."

Memo, Lansdale to Harvey

"Mc. Harvey: Intelligence, Political, [words deleted],
Economic, (sabotage, limited deception), and Para-
military." (Lansdale, Ex. 15, p. 1).

"including liquidation of leaders."
Memo, Harvey to Helms

"The question of assassination, particularly of Fidel
Castro, was brought up by Secretary McNamara at the
meeting of the Special Group (Augmented) in Secretary
Rusk's office on 10 August. It was the obvious con-
sensus at that meeting, in answer to a comment by Mr.
Ed Murrow, that this is not a subject which has been
made a matter of official record. I took careful notes
on the comments at this meeting on this point, and the
Special Group (Augmented): is not expecting any written
comments or study on this point." (Lansdale Ex. 16).

Memo, Harvey to Helms

"the inadmissibility and stupidity of putting this type of

comment. in writing in such a document."

“would write no document pertaining to this and would
participate in no open meeting discussing it.”

Memo, Harvey to Helms

Special Group Minutes

"Gen. Cabell [Deputy DCI] noted that the internal
dissidents were pressing for the release to them
of certain small arms now in U. S. hands in the
Dominican Republic. He inquired whether the
feeling of the Special Group remained that these
arms should not be passed. The members showed no
inclination to take a contrary position at this
time." (Emphasis supplied)

State Department Document, Select Committee No. 313

"1. The USG should not lend itself to direct
political assassination.

2. US moral posture can ill afford further
tarnishing in the eyes of the world.

3. We would be encouraging the action, supplying
the weapons, effecting the delivery, and. then
turning over only the final execution to
(unskilled) local triggermen.

4. So far we have seen no real evidence of action
capability. Should we entrust ourselves and
our reputation to this extent in the absence

' thereof?

5. Can we afford a precedent which may convince
the world that our diplomatic pouches are used
to deliver assassination weapons?"

L. 4/24/60 Memo, Sec. of State Herter to President Eisenhower

action to remove Trujillo from the Dominican Republic
as soon as a suitable successor can be induced to
take over with the assurance of U. S. political,
economic, and -- if necessary -- military support.”

“Providing the arms as requested would contribute
significantly toward this end."

“a. Delivery. of approximately 300 rifles and
pistols together with ammunition and a supply of
grenades, to secure caéhe on the South shore of the
island, about 14 miles east of Ciudad Trujillo.

"b., Delivery, to the same cache described above,

of an electronic detonating device with remote
control features, which could be planted by the
dissidents in such manner as to eliminate certain

key Trujillo henchmen. This might necessitate train-
ing and introducing into the country by illegal entry
a trained technician to set the bomb and detonator.”

"Mr. Merchant explained the feeling of the Depart—
ment of State that limited supplies of small arms
and other material should be made available for
dissidents inside the Dominican Republic. Mr. Parrott
said that we believe this can be managed securely by
CIA, and that the plan, would call for final trans-.
portation into the country being provided by the '
dissidents themselves. The Group approved the

Memo, Mann to Merchant

"Opposition elements have consistently asked us to
supply them with "hardware" of various types. This
has included quantities of conventional arms and
also, rather persistently, they have asked for

some of the more exotic items and devices which
they associate with revolutationary effort.”

Memo, Scott to Merchant

“agreed in terms of Tom Mann's memo"
Cable, Dearborn to Devine
"delighted" "exotic equipment."

CIA memo

"the key to the success of the plot [to overthrow
the Trujillo regime] would be the assassination
of Trujillo.”

CIA memo

"(a) Ex-FBI agents who would plan and execute

the death of Trujillo.

(b) ‘Cameras and other items that could be used
to fire projectiles.

(c) A chemical that could be rubbed on the palm
of one's hand and transferred to Trujillo in
a handshake, causing delayed lethal results.

(a) Silencers for rifles that could kill from a
distance of several miles. (Id.)"

CIA memo

". . . the members of our club are now prepared in
their minds to have a picnic but do not have the
ingredients for the salad. Lately they have
developed a plan for the picnic, which just might
work if they could find the proper food. They have
asked us for a few sandwiches, hardly more, and we
are not prepared to make them available. Last week
we were asked to furnish three or four pineapples
for a party in the near future but I could remember
nothing in my instructions that would allow me to
contribute this ingredient. Don't think I wasn't
tempted. I have rather specific guidelines to the
effect that salad ingredients will be delivered
outside the picnic grounds and will be brought to
the area by another club.
