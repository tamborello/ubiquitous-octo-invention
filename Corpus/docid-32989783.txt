Memorandum

F TO > ALL EMPLOYEES DATE: 10/10/75
cbf SAC EDWARD J. KRUPINSKY ‘

SUBJECT: INTERVIEWS OF FBI EMPLOYEES BY
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

By memorandum to All Employees dated May 28, 1975,
captioned, "Interviews of FBI Employees," all employees were
L advised of the necessity of securing FBI Headquarters approval
prior to submitting to interviews by representatives of con-
gressional committees. The necessity of securing this approval
is prompted by the Enployment Agreement all employees have
signed.

== =

You were advised that Congressional Staff Members
were conducting interviews of former and/or current employees
and that this Bureau had pledged its cooperation with Con-
gress. Our cooperative efforts, of course, must be consistent
with Bureau procedures.

 

Recently, we have had attempts by Congressional
Committee Staff Members to interview current employees
without prior contact with FBI Headquarters. You are again
reminded that if a representative of a Congressional
Committee should contact a Bureau employee, that employee.
. should decline to respond to questions posed to him and advise
| the Congressional Staff Member of the necessity of receiving
| , FBI Headquarters approval before responding to questions.
