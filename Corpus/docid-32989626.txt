Item (F) is accurate and, although its disclosure is
confirmatory no serious technical damage would result from its
disclosure. To our knowledge, there has been no diplomatic
protest, disclosure could precipitate such protest. Intelligence
Division may wish to comment regarding this possibility.

Item (G) asserts that in one case it is known tha’

(Item 6, pgs. 182 & 202)

 

With regard to press allegations concerning the use
of polygraph, it was noted that during July 1971 the President
was alleged to be furious with unauthorized disclosure of
classified information relative to the SALT Talks as disclosed
in the New York Times. The President directed a sweeping
investigation to determine the source of the disclosure and
this was conducted under the direction of Mr. Egil Krogh and
others of the White House Staff.

 

A subsequent article in the Washington Post dated
September 3, 1971 stated that a State Department spokesman
had acknowledged at a news briefing that agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation had polygraphed State Department
employees suspected of leaking information on the SALT Talks
in July. This statement is not accurate and the Director of
the FBI (J. Edgar Hoover) denied this allegation in a letter
to the Washington Post and said that the polygraph examinations
had been conducted by another agency.

As noted in the CIA notes in fact, it was CIA that
conducted the polygraph examination in conjunction with the
State Department and the FBI was not involved in any way in
these polygraph examinations. It is recalled that FBI
officials had been called to a White House meeting headed
by Mr. Krogh in which it was indicated we might have to
conduct some polygraph examinations and weré so alerted. A
subsequent call from the White House to the FBI instructed
that the FBI polygraph examinations would not be required.

In view of above, it does not appear the FBI would
incur any damage to its reputation or recognized use of the
polygraph in carefully selected criminal and security matters
in which we have jurisdiction.

Item (A) is believed to be accurate and in the absence of
additional detail no serious damage would be suffered by release of
this information.

Item (B) is accurate and as long as target is not specifically
identified no serious damage should be incurred. It should be recognized,
however, that although the concept of intercepting cryptographic
machine emanations would come as no surprise to those familiar with
intelligence work, confirmation of a functioning system could encourage

| implementation of countermeasures which would déprive the U.S. of
invaluable information.

Item (C) is accurate except that the equipment has not been
operated for some time. Without specific identification no serious
damage would result from disclosure of this information.

Item (D) is inaccurate to the extent that it states that
‘installation is not fully operational because the full complement
of personnel have not yet arrived." Aside from.that, disclosure
of information could lead the knowledgeable foreign government to be
certain of Bureau's participation and take whatever diplomatic steps
they felt necessary. Decision to withhold is an operational/political
one rather than one which would affect technical capabilities and, therefore,
the Laboratory is making no recommendations in this regard.

5. Page 00222

Item (E) is accurate and entirely too revealing. If there

is any way this tem can be deleted from material yet to be given to

| anyone outside the intelligence community, it should be done. As
written, it suggests a concerted effort toward a penetration to be
attempted in the future. Disclosure of this information could easily
negate millions of dollars already spent and literally years of work
already performed - the largest single project ever undertaken by
this Bureau. In view of our responsibilities in the counter-intelligence
field, the FBI, as well as the intelligence community, and perhaps the
free world as well, would suffer incalculable harm from release of this
information. It would also be appropriate for the Intelligence Division
to comment on this item.

TYP SECRET.

Purchase Order #16555 was issued to CIA on 9/21/72 in the
amount of $4,639. The video tube was for use in a closed circuit
television camera.

 

Item 13 lists 2 "Tube, Image, WL 30691" as having been
furnished the FBI on 3/26/71 at a cost of $4,607 each. This entry

' is probably a duplication of Item 4 on page 0019. Bureau records

AW 55113

show that Purchase Order #5450 dated 5/21/71 was issued to CIA
for this equipment for use in CCTV cameras. No purchase order
to support two such acquisitions (March and May) could be located.

Item 14 lists 2 "Cameras, Television" at.a unit cost of
$18,300. This entry probably refers to that equipment acquired under
Purchase Order #21100 and is detailed in Paragraph b. page 00112, above.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.
3. Page 00119

Item 2 lists 25 "Actuators, Recorders."' The entry is
accurate.

Purchase Order #17204 was issued to CIA on 10/18/72 for 25
each QTC-lis @ $591.94. This equipment is identical to that obtained on
Purchase Order #8989 mentioned above.

Item 3 lists "Tube, Image, Burn-Resistance" etc., and isa
duplication of Item 12 on page 00118. Note identical dates.

Item 4 lists "Tube, Image, WL 30691" and is believed to refer
to the transaction carried as Item 13 on page 00118.

Items 5, 6, and 7 list "Transmitters, Module, Plug-In,
and Power Supply - UWP-39A." These entries are essentially accurate.

Purchase Order #4203 was issued to CIA on 4/6/71 for
2 each transmitters SRT-67 @ $1372. 35; 1 each transmitter QRT-10A
@3160. 33; 1 each module QWT-18 @ $1247. 40; and, 1 each power
supply UWP-39A @ $538. 65.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

RE: SENSTUDY

The following are comments prepared by the Radio
Engineering Section of the FBI Laboratory and relate to copies of
excerpted pages from a report written by the Central Intelligence
Agency. Comments are keyed to page numbers which appear in
the lower right-hand corner of each sheet.

l. Page 00112

Paragraph b. refers to FBI purchases of television
equipment and is accurate as to equipment obtained. According to
Bureau records, Purchase Order #21100 was issued to CIA on
4/11/73 and was amended 9/24/73. The items were 1 each WTC-20
@ $18, 300 and 1 each WTC-23 @ $18,600. Purchase Order #21469
dated 5/1/73 was issued to CIA for 2 each lens systems totaling $11, 200.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.
2. Page 00118

Item 9 lists 50 "Actuators, Recorders." This entry is
partially correct.

Bureau records show that Purchase Order #8989 was
issued to CIA on 11/17/71 for 30 each QTC-Ils at $488.25, and 20 each
QTC-12As at $236, 25.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

Item Il lists 1 "Camera, Video."' This entry could refer to
that transaction detailed in Purchase Order #18301 issued to CIA on
11/27/72 for 1 each WTC-20 camera in the amount of $18,400. Tubes
installed in these cameras were of the type mentioned under Item 12
and 13 below.

Item 12 lists 1 "Tube, Image, Burn-Resistance, Equivalent
of WL 30691.'' This entry is accurate.

Reference is made to W. 0, Cregar to Mr. W. R.
Wannall memorandum dated 7/24/75, captioned as above. This
memorandum advised, CIA, had prepared a document citing instances
wherein CIA believed some of its activities may have exceeddd G
its legal mandate. Portions of this CIA document were
furnished this Bureau and referenced memorandum requested
documents pertaining to a particular Bureau division and/or
Intelligence Division section be reviewed to identify the
subject matter and make an assessment as to whether any
compromise to this Bureau's operation is involved. Those i
portions of the CIA document pertaining to the IS-2 Section j;
of the Intelligence Division are pages 29, 30, 171, 190, i,
191, 193, 194, 197, 198, 203, 330, and 482. :

 

A vYeview has been made of the material, supra, and a
the following comments apply: “

Pages 29, 30, under the heading "Merrimac," refer
to recruitment and handling of “several Agents" to covertly
monitor dissident groups in the Washington area and states
one was so successful the'"Agent' was turned over to the FBI.
We have no idea who the "Agent" was and in absence of identi-
fying information no compromise exists to Bureau aa

C- 102 a ~ / le.3, 7 » Hg
Page 171 refers to CIA producing a document Ltda q
"Restless Youth" in two versions. The version dealing with
radical students in America was sent only to the President
and two other high officials. Page 171, itself, im~no way. .
compromises Bureau cperations. “ .

i AUG 11 1975
Pages 190, 191, aiso deal with the "Restless Youth"

readers, ‘"a copy may be in the Johnson Library," and refers
to updating of the document. These pages, themselves, in no
way compromise Bureau operations.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R, Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

tion of several short intelligence memoranda dealing with the
foreign connections of U. S, organizations and activists
involved in the anti-war movement. Reference is made to.°
collecting information from their own sources "and through
liaison with the FBI." A reference is also made to primary
source of information being "sensitive intercepts produced
by NSA." While these pages do not directly compromise
Bureau operations, disclosure of NSA intercepts could well
indirectly adversely affect Bureau operations by disclosure

of sensitive techniques which . produce extremely valuable
information to the intelligence community, of which the FBI
is a part.

Pages 197, 198, refer to the response to an inquiry
as to involvement in domestic affairs by the Director, Central
Reference Service, cia, and in no way compromises Bureau
operations.

Page 203 refers to a similar response by Director,
Foreign Broadcast information Service, CIA, and includes a
reference to their monitoring foreign broadcasts of Jane
Fonda and Ramsey Clark and furnishing transcripts at the
request of the FBI and Department of Justice for consideration
for possible trial use. There is no compromise of Bureau
cperations involved as this was to be evidence in a public
trial and would have required CIA personnel to publicly
testify.

 

; Page 330 again makes reference to "Restless Youth"
jand use of FBI reports. It also refers to a 1967 CIA study
of "SDS and its foreign ties." The page, itself, does not
compromise Bureau operations.

Page 482 refers to a "project MPLODESTAR," which
involved manipulation of assets against targets in the
"leftist and communist milieu in various parts of the world."
Comments include "each case is cleared with the FBI..." The
page itself does not compromise Bureau operations.
