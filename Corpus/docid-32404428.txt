MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Allen v. DOD, Phone Calls with Jim Lesar re Indices

1. Yesterday, Jim Lesar called me after 5:00 p.m.- He asked
me:

a. Whether CIA, at the time it transferred documents
to NARA under the JFK Act, had given NARA an index of those
documents on disks. If CIA had, Mr. Lesar would like. .
copies. —

  

b. Whether there is an index to the sequestered
collection. Mr. Lesar said he recalled CIA stating in some
pleading that it had an index to the collection. If there
-was such an index, Mr. Lesar would like a copy.

c. What the status was for the processing of the
minutes of the DCI Morning Meetings. He grumbled a bit that
he sought have sought a court deadline.

2. I told Mr. Lesar I would check on the first two
questions and that the minutes of the DCI Morning Meetings were
with the HRG to process: I further stated that he should not
complain about not yet receiving the minutes of the DCI Morning
Meetings because he was receiving copies of main body of JFK
material that was being processed first. I told Mr. Lesar I
would leave a message on his answering machine the next day after
I checked into his first two questions regarding indices. I then

called Rich Brown of DOJ and related the above conversation.

HW 53217

3. Today, I called John Pereira (C/HRG) and we discussed
Mr. Lesar's questions. I then left a message on Mr. Lesar's
answering machine to the following effect:

a. CIA had not provided NARA with any disks containing
‘an index to the assassination records that were transferred.
However, it would provide disks at some point and I thought
CIA would probably be able to provide him copies; depending
on how onerous it would be to make copies. :

b. The HRG did. not recall finding an index to the
sequestered collection, but that if Mr. Lesar would cite me
to the pleading in which CIA represented to have an index I
would try to search for one.
