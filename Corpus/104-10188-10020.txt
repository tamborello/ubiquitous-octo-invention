5. Administrative/Finance: , There was a large amount of

: fon?'ta the resettlement of these two Agents. This has been
discussed ia Separate cable traffic, Costs exceeded the programmed

-.amount because of the. large séverance Pay paid both agents who had

over’ten years service eacir. KDAFGHAN-1 was paid U.S. $8,170.00

6. Plans: We have no plans to replace KDAFGHAN with another

- strictly photo-surveillance project. The production does not
justify the cost. However, we do -have Plans to obtain a multi-
purpose basechouse in the area’ that. can serve as a Site for taking
photos when necessary, serve as a LP for future audio operations
against AMFINK, and as a -base from which to dispatch a future

‘surveillance team. The PBRUMEN section has. already started the
Search for agent assets who, in turn, can look for an appropriate
Site. The atquisition of the latter will be the most difficult as
rental property is ata premium in the AMFINK area. Headquarters

1. Operatbonal Activities: This Project continued as before
for the major portion of this period with KDAFGHAN providing photo
coverage fov cight hours per day, five days per week, of the AMFINK
‘dustallation., In April the principal avent, KDAFGHAN-1, was provided
with new photoyraphic equipment..to improve the quality of the take,
This later proved unuseable as ‘sunlight playing on the mirror of
the lens was plainly visible from the target area in the afternoons,
The Avont returned to the use of his old equipment, It being the
current Case Officer's practice to hold nearly all meetings wlth -
this Agent in the Case Officer's auto about once every two wecks we
decided to terminate-the KDAFGHAN safehouse as unnecessary,
KDAFGHAN-1 was notified of this in carly June and nearly collapsed,
The satchouse had been his refuge from the OP and his mother, _-
KDAFGIAN-2. . We intended to put him on vacation when Lt was decided
(References B and C) to terminate him and his Project. The last
portion of this period was then spent in closing down the operation,
removing equipment from the OP, restoring the OP to its original
condition and then assisting the Agents in their preparations for
resettling’ to Madrid. All of this was finally accomplished. by

31 July and the Agents were formally terminated on 1 August. |

_ Reference: mmi-41087, 29 Septesber 1971

‘ .

     

 

 
 

   
 

 
  
 

1,. We-appreciate the detailed progress report on KDAFGHAN
“submitted by reference, The complete description of KDAFGHAN .
personnel, working routine, facilities and equipment was very
helpful in understanding how this project functions. ~

 

     

 
    

; 2, Regarding your request for WOACRE advice and guidance
on hot-miking the lines..running into the gatehouse and consulate,
_ we have: discussed this possible.operation with WOACRE here who

| offer the following comments. First, to accomplish a hot-mike

installation, you must be able to get access to the telephone
-wires, If you can gain access to the phone lines, it would be
possible to hot-nike the telephone without getting to the instru-
ment itself. ’ However, a non-access system like this will not .
‘work. if the target line goes through a switchboard or if there
are multiple telephone lines going into the sane instrument.
Based on your description of the embassy telephone system, it
would appear to rule out a hot-aike operation unless you can find
and gain access to a single line that does not go through a switch-
.board, Any such operation, if one igs proposed, would have to he
unilateral because the non-access system is not for exposure to

liaison. a

 
   
       
       
  
      
 
   
   
      
     

3. It is possible that your interests in this operation
could be sérved equally well by an audio penetration of the
gatehouse, Such a penetration could be made by a carry~-in
“quick plant" type of transmitter. Perhaps one of your agents who
regularly visita the gatehouse could be employed to carry in a
device, or you could exploit KDTUCK-4's close friendship with
EDACOUSTIC-11 to get a transmitter into the target. We would
appreciate your comments.
