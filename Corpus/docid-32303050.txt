Reurlet Y 25/ 60, captioned as above setting forth details of MISUR —
survey at subject's cottage. .

The various aspects of providing: MISUR coverage under the peculiar
conditions presented ‘by this case have been considered. The presentation
of the survey material submitted is excellént reflecting thoroughness in the
survey and detail « in the proposed installation. ~

From the installation standpoint, the radio-microphone installation
recommended may be feasible; however, other technical factors rule out
the use of radio-microphone equipment in proposed installation. This type —
equipment ig suitable only for short term installations whére operation fer
a few days or a week or two may be expected to provide the desired coverage.
Radio-microphone equipment ig not designed for continuous operation ovér
longer periods of tie and it must be expected that extended periods of
operation will result in failure of transmitter tubes or other components, —
Control equipment suggested to provide intermittent operation of transmitter
would not eliminate this problem since control equipment would be in
continuous operation and therefore would be subject to failure.

 

It appears that two possibilities exist whereby MISUR coverage
of this residence may be effected by operation of microphone over wires.
These may have already been evaluated by you and discarded in favor of

_the proposed radio-microphone installation. Sings the Bureau considers

MISUR coverage of subject's cottage very desirable, itis requésted that
you provide Bureau with comments and observations regarding possibility
of MISUR coverage along following lines:

1. Should telephone seryjce be requested it may be
possible to operate ‘le Pajr Microphone~ (S
Telephone (SPMT)._ fT solsPMT it may also be
used to operate one or two microphones or MOUSE
units on the subscriber's telephone wire without
additional wires. Microphones could be installed
prior to occupancy of the cottage and leads
connected to telephone lines fe Phin e service

 

is established: Operation of/SPMT funit requires 6)
oped through, the

forth details of this equipment and {gchnical
considerations necessary fo] SPMT

 

2, The possibility of using underground wires for
microphone egress is a possibility in this case.

It may be possible to follow the route of the water
or sewer lines in the immediate vicinity of the
cottage andthen route the underground cable to
telephone company pole where connections can be '
made to telephone wires leading to a plant. Security
of wire laying operations and terrain conditions will
largely determine whether underground wire can be
laid to suitable point for connection to overhead
telephone wires. .

it is desired that any additional survey necessary be conducted to
evaluate these possibilities for MISUR coverage, and that the Bureau be
advised without delay whether either approach in this MISUR installation
appears to be feasible.

Enclosed is a sketch showing the circuitry proposed/

With, the exception of the telephone line, all tne
wiring illus Mis use be installed immediatel
Later, if antsewp} s used, all that would be () :

necessary to do is route the incoming telephone i
line under the disguised house wiring terminal box,
cut the line and make four connections. fe th

event a separate line is available and th df Spurs no(S)

used, the line would be attached at the pornts

marked with an asterisk (*). In either event,

switching facilities would be provided at the plant

for reversing the polarity of the microphone

voltage, so that selective coverage within the

cottage would be possible. MOUSE No. 3 is feTt to be

very désirable since it would cover conversations on

the porch--a probable place for many conversations

during the summer months. It is recognized that
placing MOUSE units Nos. 2 and 3 in parallel creates

an unbalanced condition when reversing microphone
voltage polarity. If it is possible to use the — #”
OU regulated power supply in conjunction With the )

 

7 Hc 16

P witching unit, it appears logical that this
unit will automatically compensate for the unbalance.
If it is not possible to use the regulated power supply
then it would appear that the microphone current .could
be adjusted manually at the plant.

If it is later determined feasible to bring an under-
ground line into the cottage, this line would also be
connécted at the points marked by an asterisk (*),

Xe
eS

No alteration of the future telephone instrument is
planned at this time since it is not felt that

additional microphone coverage would be necessary. In
addition, the current requirements of and the audio levels
from the instrument microphone would probably not be
compatible with the MOUSE units.

ReBuairtel 2/1/60. and your airtel 2/4/60.

Your suggestion that 2 microphone-~telephone type
of installation be employed im connection with this proposed
surveillance is not approved. While the Laboratory is of the
opinion this type of installation will be technically
feasible, it would, in effect, constitute a telephones tap
which would intercept telephone conversations and for that —
-Peason is not being approved.

In the event <fuitabre circumstances indicate the
desirability of considering an alternate type of installation,
you should advise Buyeau, furnishing your recommendations.

NOTE ‘Pittsburgh ascertained that a cottage is under
construction in a remote suburban area approximately 25 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh, Pa., and 8 miles from New Kensington, Pa.
An informant has advised that this cottage, when completed, will be
utilized by Gabriel Mannarino, Pittsburgh top hoodlum, He has
also advised hoodlums from the Pittsburgh area and from other parts
of the country will probably utilize this cottage as a meeting
place. . Pittsburgh recommended that the premises be surveyed to
determine if special covérage could be installed.

Pursuant to Bureau authority, this survey was completed
-and Pittsburgh recommended installation of a radio-microphone type
of equipment. This was considered by the Laboratory which concluded
rouon ‘tha t/ type of equipment is. feagib] nly ry short term installations

SUBJECT: GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka.,

Remylet of 1/25/60 and Bureau airtel dated 2/1/60. .

The alternate possibilities for coverage set out in the :
above referenced airtel were much appreciated. Although , :
.they had been previously considered by this office, they . .

were tentatively discarded in favor of a radio-microphone

installation for the following reasons:

 

Regarding suggestion No. 1 (use of an[semz}nstaiiation) G)
Due to the character of this case it was’ presumed

that it would be difficult to obtain authority for

a microphone-telephone type of installation. Also

it was realizéd that a local plant would be necessary

and would increase the cost of monitoring. In

addition, such an installation would not be

productive until telephone service was requested

atid: ingitalled at the cottage.

Régarding, suggestion No. 2 (use of an underground cable):
The, distiince, terrain and security problems involved
wowid Waké such an undertaking extremely difficult. Ve en
No Wwatéry4tsewer or gas lines have been or will be ~
extended from the road to the cottage, Such public
utilitigs are not available due to the rural

lotation of the cottage.

; Due to the urgency of completing the interior portion of
this installation, additional surveys_bave_not been
made. Based on current knowledge, a Puttinstaliation(S)
is believed feasible. The possibility of running an
underground cable has not been entirely abandoned
but additional surveys would be necessary to make a
full evaluation. There is a third alternative of getting
| a signal from the cottage to the road. If, through the
: Laboratory's established sources in the wire manufacturing \
: industries, it is possible to obtain or have made a length
: of disguised twistedspair drop-line, then an extra pair
could be securely carried into the cottage} ne main
advantage of such a facitity (over oof se is that it(S)
would not necessarily have to be monitored locally.
The Byreau is in a position of being able to determine i
the desirability and feasibility of obtaining such wire. :

Due to the urgency of completing the interior portion

of this installation, this office has concentrated on
planning this portion so that it can be installed
‘immediately and still be used with whatever exterior
facilities become available in the future. Since at

this point the only metho hich is known to be

feasible is the use of th PMT jauthority is reavestea(S)
to immediately install the interior portion described
below: . .

 

Three MOUSE units to be installed in the same locations

: and in the same manner as described and illustrated

' (Fig. 5) in the above referenced Pittsburgh letter.
MOUSE units: No. 2 and 3 would be in parallek. The
lead wires for all three units would be brought to a

: common point located in the boxing in the southeast

' corner of the kitchen. This point is chosen since

this is the most logical entrance of any telephone

wiring subsequently installed in the cottage.
