checked with each of the. Government agencies that are mentioned
in it. State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of
the passport to the man to come back to this country and that |
has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc. - i
all of which of course we are gathering. The aspects of the ,
Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned. It is his :
intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be |
sure that whatever is said in the report is conferred in and it . |
is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So you will
have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said |
and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make. i

Dc: Well that will be fine. Thank you

“Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story andwe have . \

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency
is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection
with your investigation of the situation. in Dallas. I know
the importance the President places on this investigation
you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was
giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just
wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly '
expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.
We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report
and I am delighted that the President has called on you to
make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various
wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that firedthe gun. But there is no question
that he is the right man. There are a lot of aspects that we have |
dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter i: Mexico City.
We have now found that the: photograph that was ta cen was not
that of Oswald. We do find from our informant doin there that
Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has -
given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit
te go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give hirm
the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wold take three
weeks, He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or
ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

 

those operational sources down there. We want to handle them

_very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

Mc. Katzenbach . Who is handling it for the Department -_

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

of course go over it very carefully because it will be a report

that will be released to the public, probably through the White

Dated 6 September 1975

   
 
    

1. The referent memorandum contains two points
which require comments. The first point concerns
allegations that were made shortly after the assassination
of President Kennedy and that-Rave crept up every so often
since then. In one form or ao! r, the allegations. are
that Lee Harvey OSWALD had/Bek connected with the Agency.
The allegations are tovanty stowage.

conceivable way. ordered me to make the checks
. directly and personally to the degree possible and not
to accept statements of intermediaries. He also ex-
plained that he was following instructions from-Mr. R. i
Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one ,of the
Agency’ s key contact officials with the Warren Le :
Commission. Le

b. Although I had already checked the Main Index

of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I

rechecked the Main Index and found no'record beyond i
that which I had already obtained.before (plus, those i
items which had been integrated into the records system !
since the assassination). There was nothing in the DDO
records which indicated any Agency connection with i
OSWALD.

4. I recall very clearly that we were extremely
concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American: returning
_ from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by
pcD, thus having established contact with the Agency.
The same point has now, quite understandably, beén made
by the two CBS newsmen. Having some knowledge of this |
subject I have personally concluded that there is valid |
. xeason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time.
He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD
had he been to the USSR and returned to the US hefore !
1957/1958. Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,
particularly by Americans, before that time was quite
uncommon and we were hungry for eyewitness information in |

of that decade te ere so many persons travelling to

and spogt fierCarset pplicability was instituted. In
