visit. In view of obvious purpose of trip, it is believed

we should find out from CIA what is going on.\ There are
increasing indications of conferences with i ential Cuban
leaders who oppose Castro, particularly by State Department,
and since we are not being apprised of any U.S. moves to back
the Castro opposition, it is believed we should inquire
promptly where there are indications of official :or semi-
official encouragement. It is not believed we should
investigate Dr. Rey while he is here. Miami Office has been
in contact with Benitez and Faget, who are to be contacted by
Rey and who have professed to be cooperative. We are not
asking Miami to interview Benitez and Faget until after

Dr. Rey’s departure. This will afford some idea of whether
they will come to us voluntarily and give us a straight story
on opposition planning. [Data received from Mexico is. CIA
data which has been given to State and. Bureau making no G9(4)
further dissemination. Bureau data mentioned herein was
‘furnished to State by letter 2/18/54. (Classified Secret
