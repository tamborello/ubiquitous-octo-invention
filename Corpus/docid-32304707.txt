New dersey; that JOHN MISURACA told them to tell the fellows
in California not to "erack" when interviewed by the FBI; that
money and attorneys would be made available if they were needed.

Informant suggested to ALEX that they advise their
"Capo" ANGELO MARINO of San Jose, California regarding these
interviews ‘by ‘the FBI. ALEX told informant they should say
nothing to the membership in San Jose at this time because
the latter would think that they are attracting the FBI's .
attention. ALEX told informant that what the San Jose. group
doesn't kmow won't hurt them.

ALEX CAMARATA advised SF 2550-C-TE that he was
staying away from his home at nights, as well as during the dey,
in order to avoid the interview with the FBI,

Informant advised PETE MISURACA aia not inform
anyone of his having been interviewed by the FBI.

Under the Top Echelon Informant Program of this office
ANGELO MARINO, "Capo" of La Cosa Nostra in San Jose, California,
was interviewed at San Jose on 2/13/64, He denied membership !
and knowledge of La Cosa Nostra and denied knowing any of its i
members, but was somewhat disturbed when advised it was known
that he was a member of that organization. ANGELO, co-owner of
the Califoriia Cheese Company of San Jose, indicated his compsatitor
in the cheese business probably gave out the false information : :
of his being a member of La Cosa Nostra, . :

 

ANGELO called JOE CERRITO, "Don" of the La Cosa Nestra-
in San Jose, to his residence at 10: 00 P, M., 2/13/64. SF 2354-c-TE
was visiting JOE CERRITO in Los Gatos, California at the time
the cali came from ANGELO MARINO, Informant reported he accompanic
CERRITO to ANGELO's house and that ANGELO and CERRITO went into
another room to talk while informant stayed in the kitchen area
with PRECIOUS MARINO, wife of ANGELO and Mr. and Mrs. MARIO MAGGIO,
brother of PRECIOUS MARINO, who were visiting the MARINOs from
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

 

SF 2354-C-TE reported .that ANGELO eppeared to be very :

especially indicated concern about our knowing of his membership
in the organization, ANGELO indicated to CERRITO that the
interview with the FBI was for a duration of about an hour and
a half. CERRITO was very critical that ANGELO or any member

of the organization should allow an interview with the FBI to go
for more than a few minutes. CERRITO indicated they should
merely tell the FBI they have nothing to say and suggest they
contact their attorney.

 

SF 2550-C-TE advised the interview between ANGELO
MARINO, and the FBI was not generally known to the membership of
La Cosa Nostra.

This interview with ANGELO MARINO apparently is of
great concern to the leadership of La Cosa Nostra in the San
Francisco Bay Area.

SF 2405-C* advised on 3/13/64 that STEVE ZOCCCLI,
Couneil Member of La Cosa Nostra from San Jose met with JAMES
LANZA, "Don" of San Francisco, California in the office of the
latter. They discussed the fact that ANGELO MARINO had been
interviewed by the FBI. LANZA indicated there is nothing going
on in this area; that ANGELO should have told him (the Agent}
that his facts were a bunch of lies.

Both agreed that they didn't think ANGELO was capable
of handling this type of situation; that ANGELO is too young to
be a caporegima; and that he was made a "capo" too soon.

ZOCCOLI requested LANZA not mention to CERRITO that
ZOCCOLI had discussed this matter with LANZA,

Copies of this letter are being furnished the Newark
Office in. view, of their interest in JOHN MISURACA,

wee eek.
