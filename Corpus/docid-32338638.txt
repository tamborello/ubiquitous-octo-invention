Dear Mr. Schlichting:

I am most gratified to

receive your letter of July 2lst, regarding
definite plans for publication of THEORY AND TECENIQUE,
and FILM IN THE SATLLE OF IDEAS.

Tie terms are entirely satis-—
factory. I shall write to Mr. Felshin at M&& telling
him that I feel we shOuld accept the proposal on
the film book. I assume that whatever contract or
letter is required can be sent to me on TPEORY AND
TECHNIQUE, along with tre advance payment, The

arrangements, and payment on tie other book should
be sent to Mr’. Felshin.

a I am troubled by your enquiry
concerning the disregard of contemporary German
i . playwrights in THEORY AND TECHNIQUE. It is a real
' weakness, which goes back to certain limitations
| , on my knowledge and understanding when the book
' - was first written twenty years ago. It is also
[ A CU that many other ceatemporary trends are not
j —_ “—-—““s doquateiysait-sith: “or example, the only
j - approach to the R .siai theatre of the twentieti
century is un term. of ‘hekhov and S@anislavski
(on pp. 11'-117), « -d* is is quite different
fromthe sert of troatmeit I would give Chekhov today.
(Perhaps ou have scen sy study of Chekhov in MASSES
AND MAINGYREAM, Octene 19542) It is hardly right that
my ‘material in the boot contains no mention of Gorki.

; I do not feel that I can enter

into a fuller discussion of German or other txxaa
contemporary European theatre trénds: to do so would
mean a very extensive rewriting, a change in the
form of the book, and would require a detailed know-
lefge of recent dramatic development which I do not
possess. However, I feel that the matter might be
covered in a footnote. Let me know what you think about

this.

 

 

oe - *  .J am also troubled by the
citation from Stalin on p. 16 of FILM IN THE BATTLE
“OF IDEAS-- not on “purely political grounds, but because
I feel“iteis a rather arbitrary, and doctrinnaire
statement. I think I should rewrite this page, using
about the same space for a somewhat less sweeping
_ statement of the class hold upon the superstructure.
