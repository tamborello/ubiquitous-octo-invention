1. It-makes little difference now, but REDWOOD had at one time an
. OI interest in Oswald, As soon as I had heard OswalB's name, I recalled
i» - that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed -- sometime in Summer 1960 --
with the then-Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the layéng
on of interview(s) through KUJUMP or other suitable Channels. At the .
moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family --
were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival.

2. I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck
me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I
told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get
the information we need, because this individual looks odd." j We were -
: particularly interested in the OI Oswald might provide on th » Minsk

an factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city -
itself, and of course we sought the usual.8I that might help develop
target personality dossiers.

3, I was phasing into my LPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at
the time, Thus, I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's-artival.-
I do not know what action developed thereafter.

4, As an afterthought,-I recall also that at the time I was becoming
increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered
in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet
women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually
divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "home".
The AEOCEAN 3 case was among the first of these, and we eventually turned -
up something like two dozen similar cases. We established links between
‘some of these women and the KGB. KUDESK became. interested in the developing
trend we had come across, It was partly out of curiosity to learn if :
Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of
interest in Oswald's own checharve) in the U SSR, that we showed operational
arve .

intelligence interest in the story.
