Re St. Louis teletype, re/2o/6r. (Wb)

. PH 269-C advised on 12/20 and 21/61 that FRANK
PALERMO is in Philadelphia and to his knowledge has not
left the city. He said there has been no indication to him
that JOHN JOSEPH VITALE, mentioned in referenced teletype
has been in Philadelphia. (Ww)

From description at aireraft landing site in
referenced teletype, it does not appear this would have
been Philadelphia International Airport as only body of
water close to Philadelphia International is the Delaware
River, which is very seldom in the landing pattern due to
the airport's site, YY)
