introductory statement coincides with aforcmentiozed statenent of

c.

the Commission and is designed to emphasize the liaison capacity of
U. S.. representatives im Hexico. You will aote that the Bureau
did mot delete all references to the T symbol sources im the
unclassified vergion for. in Burean’s opinion to de so and to
merely report results of investigation in a Bureau letterhead
without reference to various sources would create the impression
that Burcau representatives, in fact, conducted the reported
investigation. Note, however, that all references in your
Classified version to the first cenfideatial source abroad have
either been deleted or attributed to 7-17, who is ideatified in
