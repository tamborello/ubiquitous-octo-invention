VI, -COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended approximately $26, 250 during Fiscal Year 1962
(1 December 1961 - 30 June 1962) and has thus far during Fiscal Year |
1963 (through 30 September 1962) expended about $7,000.00. I: is.
anticipated that about $8,000.00 will be.expended during the last two
months (October and November 1962) of the project year. This will

- make a total expenditure during the project year of about $43, 250, or
$6, 250.00 under the budget estimate of $49, 500.00.

B.. Next Project Year ~ Of the total $49, 900.00 budget, itemized below,

. approximately $30, 400.00 should be expended during the remainder of
Fiscal Year 1963 and the balance, $19, 500.00 should be expended during
Fiscal Year 1964, Normal accounting procedures will be used for all ex-

 

penditures. .

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be com-
pletely fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made
important and valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives —
specifically and to other Station activities In general. SCANTLING's
production, measured against monetary expenditures, case officer time
and other inrengtble factors, unquestionably justifies his cont inuation
as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

“B. Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relat ion to project
object ives): . ; ; Oo

1, "To collect ‘operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
“personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic basé houses," _
Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LUILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute -

to this objective. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute

to. the above objective, This was described in detail in the 1960 Request for
Project Renewal, (IMMA - 15979)

2. "To collect operational Information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity," The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objective,
Among LIENTRAP’s regular and extensive photographic assignments, was
the photo stakeout of prominent Mexican Communists (some of whom have
never been photographed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party
‘Headquarters, During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover
the recent move of PCM Headquarters (the first information Stati ion had
_ of the move) and to continue photo surve illance at the new site,

3. "To provide operational ‘support to Station operat ions, t.e, 7
-rent hotel rooms and apart:ments, and conduct counter-surveillances,'
. GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for oth ro
". Station operations and activities.'-'GERENDE's’ comprehensive aréa 1838"
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
-extremely valuable Sation asset for such support activities, GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them,

4, The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE s control _
and supervision is considered worthwhile and in some cases unique, The
Station concludes, therefore, that this ; Segment 0 of the LIEMPTY Project
should be cont inued, :

. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives: :

As stated in previous project renewals, it can readily be noted that ;
. Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in
this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related
' Mission Directive, The project has not produced any positive intelligence
nor has it been interided that it should do so, The project's sole purpose
_ts to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information|
in support of other Station operat ions,

Il, CHANGES

There have been 1 no changes in the LIEMPTY Project duri ing the”
past project year affecti ting either objectives or Personnel.

Ith. EFFECT IVENESS

; There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter
the validity of the remarks made in Sect ion Mi of 1960 project renewal re-

quest (HMMA 15979) —
WV. PROBLEMS

 

oe The security problem in connection with the I LICALLA operation,
which was described in 1960 renewal request, is still present but has
caused no known difficulty, At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW -9736, the |
LICALLA base was reactivated on 29 May 1961. The base operator.con- ~
_. tinues to be alert for any unusual Ancidents which might indicate that the
“base has been compromised, oe s .

V. PLANS . . .
The Station considers that the project is operating at.its optimum
size and does not plan to expand it during the coming year, Efforts will

_be continued to refine and better utilize the existing project organizational

arrangements, As in the past, the Station will continue its efforts to
improve the compartmentation_and a of the project, .

Review of Project LIEMPTY

(For the purpose 0 of Project Renewal) — ‘

I. CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCT ION :

A. Oliver G, SCANTLING Segment (discussed | in relation to project
objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
.. personnel and physical facilities. '' SCANTLING has continued (see pre-
vious Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-~17999, 31
October 1961, HMMA-14093, 13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18
November 1960) to provide worthwhile information pertaining to this ob- | |
“jective, During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be used ex~ H
- tensively to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT and LIENVOY, An ex- —
cellent example of this blending of various Station support assets was the
investigation and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads from both
LIENVOY and LIFEAT indicated the possibility of launching a successful
technical operation against the residence of a high ranking LIMERICK
intelligence officer assigned to Mexico under diplomatic cover, with the
aid of the thorough casing report and neighborhood investigation completed
by SCANTLING, Station KURIOT personnel, supported by other Station .
-gupport assets, were successful in installing a technical device in the ; =
target. Po, a.

SCANTLING continues to be the Station's primary means of keeping
current records on the residences of the many Soviet personnel in Mexico
City. This is primarily accomplished through SCANTLING's follow up of
all LIENVOY leads which indicate interest by Soviets in specific quarters.

. See previous project renewal requests for additional details. >

2. “To collect operational informatt ion pertaining to other targets of
'- opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence in- ;

_ terest operating ‘ in Mexico", SCANTLING is very useful for collect! ting in-
Poe formation on. other, Station targets: a oe ea a

   

. a. On the basis of a lead from the ODACID installati fon in
- Veracruz, the Station (with Headquarters support) mounted an
operation to unobtrusively sabotage a large unit of agricultural | oo
machinery (of U.S. origin) which was in transit toCuba. To
mount this operation, a precise and detailed casing of the imple- - 4
“ment was essential, This SCANTLING was able to accomplish in in
one trip to Veracruz STant
; the operation.

b,. SCANTLING provided the Station a detailed investigation. *. !

_ of Harotun ("Harry") KOPOIAN, employee of American Communists * |

Albert and Margaret MALTZ, which .::: determined the residence -
of KOPOIAN as well as his family status and connections, :

me c. In the ‘Satellite area; SCANTLING completed 2 a casing of -
_ an official Yugoslav installation in Conjunction with a Projected ;
Station technical operation. yg :

3. “To exploit operational leads through, recruitments, Gebriefings,
* anid surveillances."" SCANTLING las contributed to this objective both -
directly and indirectly as. noted in the following examples: oe

a. SCANTLING. completed a detailed and secure ‘interview of
_ the fiancee ofSEBSMOOTH to determine her connection with the
: principals in theMOGMAYFOWL case, particularly any connection
-with procurement of documents used in the- flight behind the [ron
Curtain, This assignment was extremely sensitive (SCANTLING
‘ was not told true reason for interview) and SCANTLING did an ..
admirable job while maintaining his cover for having the interview,

b, SCANTLING was called on for extensive initial spade work
in theBE HEIKNAVE/BECHICK operation,. SCANTLING . gave his |.
' usual competent performance despite the fact that the role assigned —
him was unique to his experience, — . : '

c. _ SCANTLING performed one man surveillance of a sensitive _
. _ Station Soviet double:agent which: contributed | Significamely tc to that oe
oy operation. a io, welts

   

. 4. SCANTLING was used extensively during the visit of a
_GPIDEAL as part of the Station's effort in providing maximum
; protection for the GPIDEAL party. : , .

  

“TR, « In addition, : “SCANTLING performed: numerous pretext and. felis

eighborhood investigations, some of which were highly sensitive,

_ SCANTLING also does most.of the local investigations requested by.
ODACID and other ODYOKE. components.

 

 

 

‘4. In addition to. ‘his contributions to the above objecti ives, . _SCANTLING
is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the Station, For example,
SCANTLING handled LIEMBROIL- 72 until the return of LIMOTOR -14 in July. -
