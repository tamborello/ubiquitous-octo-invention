"ss. On 4/25/63, DL-G-S, in person, furnished to SA W. HARLAN -

BROWN a handwritten report dated 4/10/63, which report has

been serialized as 134-1A-746,

That report revealed that on 4/10/63, JOE LANDIN
attended a GI Forum meeting. The meeting, held at ALBERT

_CROYCOS' home, was a reorganization meeting. The American GI

Forum Dallas Chapter had not held any meetings regularly for
quite sometime. Nine persons attended this meeting. ‘The dues
which were $5.00 per annum are now $2.50, informant said. The
chapter pays the other half. The dues' reduction, it is

hoped, will encourage more people to join. The initiation fee
remains 50¢. The chapter will have a stand at Pikes Park during
the Cinco de Mayo Mexican Independence Day.

Informant determined that at this meeting, Crystal
City was briefly discussed. Most of the members had vaguely
heard of that city's elections (City Council and School Board
elections). Bema :

Informant had no additional information.
