Los Angeles agents 1/25/65 and 4/28/65.

/
LV T-2 is CV 421-C-TE to Cleveland agents.

ADMINISTRATIVE DATA:

By separate communication the Los Angeles Office
has been requested to furnish the New York Office with proper
characterization of LA 4335-C-TE to be used in compilation of
summary report.

It is noted that a separate file has been opened in
Las Vegas to attempt to identify ARMIN (LNU) described as
possible La Cost Nostra member.

It has been previously reported that FRANK TINELLE,
Aka Buster, who is employed as bar manager at the Tropicaga
Hotel was a suspected member. Investigation has failed to
support this allegation and in interviews denies association
with La Cosa Nostra. CUTINELLE is "semi-cooperative" and has
furnished some information of value regarding other persons.
