Full details of subject's involvement in
a recent invasionary. attempt- headed by subject against
Cuba, will be reported in the case entitled "PEDRO. LUIS
OSCAR DIAZ LANZ, NM", Bufile 2- 71597,

On May 11, 1960, BERNARD REICHARDT, local
CIA representative, Miami, contacted the Miami Office
and desired to know if the FBI was aware of any invasionary
~ plans imminent on behalf of subject.

At that time REICHARDT expressed the opinion
that should DIAZ LANZ attempt such an onslaught, it would
probably result in adverse criticism of the United
States, and that due to certain unsavory rumors concerning
DIAZ’ appropriation of funds from anti-CASTRO personalities
for his own use, DIAZ LANZ was not regarded by CIA as being
an acceptable figure’ in the anti-CASTRO movement.
