MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

This informative memorandum to retord inquiry of
Department. concerning tapes of microphone surveillances on
Martin Luther King, Jr.

On 2/5/76, Supervisor S. F., Phillips, INTD, returned
a call to Mx, Quinlan J, Shea, Jr., on the Deputy Attorney
General's (DAG) Staff, who said he had been informed by Civil
Rights Division Assistant Attorney General Pottinger that
Supervisor Campbell was the custodian of the King tapes and
Shea desired some information from Campbell. It was expjained ~~ -
to Shea that Pottinger was apparently given a wrong impression
when he, Pottinger, Listenéd to some of these tapes. Supervisor
William Campbell of the Laboratory played the tapes for Pottinger
but Campbell's connection with them are primarily of a technical |
nature. As to the "custodian" of the tapes, Shea was told that:
in Bureau records they are charged to Section Chief J, G. Deegan
and maintained in the latter's office but that if Shea wants
to talk to the person most knowledgeable as to the tapes, it was
Phillips.

Shea then said that his purpose in calling was a
desire to protect the DAG relative to a pending suit wherein
someone is attempting to obtain the tapes. He said that it was
necessary that he give advice to the DAG to support an appeal
regarding a denial of information to the person seeking the tapes. = |
Shea indicated that research resulted in a determination that the
privacy issue relating to King himself could not be raised as
King is dead but that the Department was exploring the privacy
issues as relating to the King family. At this point, Phillips
inquired as to whether or not Shea was aware of the efforts
which were initiated by the King family through its attorneys
to obtain FBI files concerning King. Shea said he was not
familiar with this fact and itwa suggested to him that he

Memorandum to Mx. W. R. Wannail
Re; Martin Luther King, Jr.
100-106670

might desire to consult with Assistant Attorney General
Antonin Scalia, (It will be recalled that early in 1975,
Assistant Director Mintz was present at a conference with
Departmental officials, including Scalia and attorneys for
the King family because of the family's desire to obtain the
FBI's files on King).

Shea sid he had no desire to hear the tapes which
he frequently referred to as the "sex tapes" but wanted to have
some idea of their contents. It was explained to him that while
the tapes’ contents were primarily of personal activities, they
were not to the exclusion of other matters such as discussions
of current events, civil rights issues and conversations
between King and his advisors.

Phillips inquired of Shea as to exactly what he
yanted to know that he would use in his advice to the DAG.
He stated that he would like to know whether or not the
revelation of these tapes would be embarrassing to the King
family and whether or not it would lead to an harassment of
the family. He was told that such revelation would be
embarrassing but that it was not clear what he meant by
harassment. He then asked whether such revelation would likely
result in the family being submitted te questions from the
press that micht be harassing to them. He was told that such
revelations would quite likely so result. Concluding, Phillips
told him that if he desired any more information, it might be
best fox Phillips to visit his office. He responded that he did
not anticipate any further needs in this matter,

ACTION:

None. For information.
