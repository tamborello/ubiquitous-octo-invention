iaterview conducted by the FBI, It was SA MC QUEEN’s opinion ba
that BURNS Would possibly use any interview with the FBI "
forhis own political gain, Because of BURNS’ political
position im the past and his possible return to politics
in the future, plus the fact that BURNS appears to possess
no informant potential, it was concluded by SA MC QUEEN
that no interview of BURNS should be made at this time.

 

In view of the above, BURNS is not being '
considered for imterview by the Chicago Division. ‘
