2. Office of Security files #202 792 and 351 502
concern Pedro Luis DIAZ LANZ but reveal no use of DIAZ LANZ
in the Cuban invasion or other Agency operational matters.
File #202 523 concerns Marcos DIAZ LANZ, the brother of
Pedro Luis DIAZ LANZ. The file reflects that Marcos DIAZ
LANZ was the Deputy Chief of Castro's air force until his
defection in July 1959, effected by this Agency by his
exfiltration from Cuba clandestinely. For the purposes of
instant memorandum, it is of note that this file contains an 06, OF
Agency Information Report stating, "According to[Colonel Oscar
MORALES Lopez, Chisf of Aviateca--the Guatemalan government-
owned airline--Commandante Pedro Luis DIAZ LANZ, former inspector
of the Cuban“rebel airforce, Captain Sergio DIAZ, and Captain
Frank FIORINI, also formerly with the rebel airforce, arrived
in Guatemala on 30 December (1959) and immediately contacted
him. They had a card from the Guatemalan Ambassador in
Washington and said that they had been in the United States
the first part of December and had talked with important
officials of the government. The three wanted to talk with
President Miguel YDIGORAS Fuentes to obtain moral support for
their -anti-Castro_activities." There is information showing
the mutual involvement of Frank FYORINI with the DIAZ LANZ
brothers in anti-Castro. activities until at least the summer
of 1963. : . :

3. Information in the file of Frank Anthony STURGIS,
aka: Frank FIORINI (#353 459), reflects that from-circa
May 1960 to at. least January 1961, STURGIS was living in the.
Miami area training a group of Cuban and American volunteers
for a military invasion of Cuba. By October 1960, the FBI
had determined that STURGIS's only activities in anti-Castro
matters were in conjunction with the activities of Pedro DIAZ
LANZ, who was one of the leaders of the anti-Castro group,
"Liberation Alliance." Reportedly, STURGIS’ invasion group
in January 1961 was calling itself, "Brigada Internacionale,"
with variations of "International Anti-Communist Brigade" and
"Anti-Communist International Brigade.” One of the sub-units
of the "Brigade" was identified in the press in July 1961 as

-being a paratroop unit called "Intercontinental Penetration

Force" or INTERPEN. The Commander of INTERPEN was identified

as Gerald Patrick HEMMING, Jr., (#429 229). The Office of
Security file of STURGIS contains nothing further until October
1968, when his arrest was announced in October 1968--while still
heading the "International Anti-Communist Brigade"--for his

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECTS: STURGIS, Frank Anthony .
aka: FIORINI, Frank
#353 459

HUNT, Everett Howard, Jr. oe
#23 $00 . .

1. In his book, Give Us This Day (‘The Inside Story of’
the CIA and the Bay of Pigs Invasion..."), on pages 98-103,
Everett Howard HUNT, Jr., gives an account of some of the ,
activities of Pedro Luis DIAZ LANZ who defected from Castro
Cuba in mid-1959 as the first chief of Castro's air force.
HUNT points out that in October 1959 DIAZ LANZ piloted a
small plane dumping hundreds of anti-Castro leaflets over
Havana. DIAZ LANZ's copilot on the flight is identified as
Frank FIORINI, aka: Frank STURGIS. HUNT goes on. to describe
what would appear to be personal contacts with DIAZ LANZ in
the Miami area,;-utilizing-the services.of Bernard BARKER in
his contacts with DIAZ LANZ and other Cubans. HUNT further
describes his attempts to involve DIAZ LANZ with the Agency
in the invasion, but HUNT's overtures were not accepted by

 

“After the invasion the Kennedy Administration
could not do enough for Manuel RAY. A cozy post
was secured for him in Puerto Rico as Chief of
Munoz Marin's housing projects. I am sure that no
equal effort was made in behalf of Pedro Luis DIAZ
-_LANZ, for our national tradition has become one of
shabby discrimination against known anti-Communists."

NOTE: HUNT's contacts with DIAZ LANZ occurred.
during the period circa October 1960 to circa
Novenber 1961 while HUNT was assigned to JMARC,
Miami.

involvement in a group attempting to enter Guatemala to
“clean out anti-Guatemalan guerrillas." At that time FIORINI
claimed that two men who were sponsoring his operation were
Bob HOWELL, allegedly a friend of the Kennedy family, and a
General BIDDLE, member of the (John) Birch Society.

4, To return to the events of the early 1960's, in
July 1962 an article appeared in the New Orleans States Item
by Bill STUCKEY, concerning an anti-Castro training base
established on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. This
wit was identified as INTERPEN, headed by Gerald Patrick |
HEMMING, Jr. The article inferred that INTERPEN was still -
part of Frank FIORINI's (STURGIS) "International Anti-Communist
Brigade." This particular unit received nationwide publicity
in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney GARRISON alleged
that INTERPEN was involved in the assassination of President
John FE, KENNEDY and that INTERPEN members were connected with

5. The above noted Bill STUCKEY who wrote the July 1962
press article about INTERPEN and HEMMING is identical with the —~
William STUCKEY who interviewed Lee Harvey OSWALD during 4& public~
broadcast in New Orleans in August 1963. According to testimony
in the Warren Commission hearings by William STUCKEY and Carlos
SRINGUIER (Cuban Student Directorate delegate in New Orleans).
in early August 1963, Lee Harvey OSWALD came to BRINGUIER's
New Orleans clothing store announcing that he, OSWALD, was a -

-- former Marine trained in guerrilla warfare who wanted to join

an anti-Castro guerrilla group in New Orleans. (NOTE :._.. Many Zz
of the INTERPEN group were ex-Marines, 2S was Frank FIORINI.) . ¢
BRINGUIER claims he Stalled OSWALD and several days later en-" wz
countered-OSWALD-on-the_streets of New Orleans passing out Ver

“Bair Play For Cuba" leaflets. The encoun er-ted—to-e—disturb=
ance, and OSWALD and BRINGUIER were arrested. BRINGUIER subse- ~
quently alerted STUCKEY to OSWALD which resulted in the broadcast
interview. It is of note that BRINGUIER inferred he was know-
ledgeable of the anti-Castro guerrilla group training on the
north shore of Lake Pontchartrain and even collected fumds for...
the travel of two of the members to Miami when the group was .
disbanded. , .

6. The individual in INTERPEN of most interest fo GARRISON
was Loran Eugene HALL, aka: Lorenzo PASCILLO, aka: Skip HALL

1963, remaining wtil after President KENNEDY was shot.
GARRISON also alleged that HALL was involved with the
"Minutemen." The HALL file reflects that in August 1963

i HALL was in Southern California, where he spoke before
numerous meetings of the John Birch Society attempting to

' raise funds for an anti-Castro planned invasion of Cuba
scheduled for mid-September 1963.
