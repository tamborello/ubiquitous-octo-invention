there for eight days under the pretext that they were in
danger. (Ibid.) Elena claimed to have told Calvillo. that
she wanted to tell her story to the American Embassy.
(Ibid.) Calvillo dissuaded her by telling her that the
American Embassy was full of Communist spies. (Ibid.)

Elena said that some of the other people who had been at
the party were taken to Veracruz where they were "protected"
by Governor Lopez Arias. {ibid; The House Select Committee
was unable to determine the veracity of Ms. Paz‘ allega-
tion.7 She said that Ruben Duran, reportedly "protected"
by General Clark Flores, was very prosperous and was
driving a big car. /EXA #586-587, Wx-7241, Entry No. 425,

told her months after the assassination that he was not
really a Communist and that killing Kennedy had been a
Mistake. (Ibid; the House Select Committee on Assassina-
tions has not been able to determine whether Ruben actually
spoke to Elena about the assassination. Ruben Duran claims
he had no reason to./

Charles Thomas circulated a copy of the Charles Tho-
mas memorandum in the American Embassy including the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency's Mexico City Station to aid
them in their investigation of the John F. Kennedy assassina-
tion. /The House Select Committee has determined that the

Central Intelligence Agency received the copy of the Thomas

memorandum prior to December 25, 1965. See below./7 The
COS wrote a note on the memo : : “What an imagina-
tion she has!?! Shoulda we send to Headquarters?" The of-

ficer replied, "Suggest sending. There have been stories

around town about all this, and Thomas is not only person

she has talked to...If memory serves me, didn't LICOOKIE
refer to Oswald and the local leftists and Cubans in one
of her squibs?" (CIA No. 588, note from SW to cos.)

The Mexico City Station called the information in
Thomas ' 12/10/65 memorandum of conversations to CIA Head-
quarters (Cable from Mexico City to the Director, Mexi 5621,
date out off my copy; CIA Nos. 584-585) ‘The cable reported
that Elena's story would be checked with LICHANT/1, against
the production from the Cuban surveillance operation "and
other sources." (Ibid.) Winston Scott wrote, next to the
routing indications on the cable, "Please ask Charles Tho-
mas if he'll 'follow up." Get questions from Anne c. (anne
Goodpasture/ Please let's discuss. Thanks." (Ibid.)

After the December 10 memorandum of conversations,
Winston Scott (Chief/Station) and Nathan Ferris (Legal

Charles
Attache) called / Thomas for a meeting. They asked him
to get a more detailed replay of Ms. Garro's story. At
this meeting Winston Scott made it clear that the FBI
had full responsibility for any further investigation in

the Oswald case. (State Dept: letter from Charles Thomas

@ friend of Rubin Duran'g,, Silvia Duran, Esuebio Azcue
(Cuban Consul in Mexico City), Emilio Carballido (a pro-
Communist writer-friend of the Durans), and a Latin Ameri-
can Negro man with red hair (unidentified) were at the
party. A marginal comment by this entry in Wx-7241

says, "How did Elena know ‘about a red-haired Negro?"
Elena also told Thomas that she had later learned that
Silvia Duran had been “Oswald's mistress while he was
there." (A note by this entry in WX-7241 says, "How

did Elena Garro know about Silvia being the mistress of
Oswald?? This is 1965.") The Mexico City Station did not
hear about the Oswald-Duran "affair" until July 1967

when a CIA Asset Liring3 reported it. /After reviewing

tions has been unable to determine who LIRING/3 was asso-

Elena told Thomas that she and her daughter had gone
to the Cuban. Embassy on November 23, 1963.and shouted
"Assassins" and other insults at the Embassy employees.

He was unable to fix the date of the party, but felt it

was probably early in September because of a heavy rain

 

which occurred. as they were leaving the party about. 2:00
a.m. (Ibid. p. 4)

Lavagnini noted no Americans present at this party.
He was familiar with ‘the appearance of Lee Harvey Oswald
because of publicity following the assassination of Presi-

dent Kennedy but otherwise had no knowledge of him and

 

had never seen him except for news photographs following
the assassination. (Ibid. p. 4) Levagnini was the only
person interviewed by the FBI who attended parties at
the Duran house in the September-—October time frame.

There is no indication on the document that this
information was given to the Central Intelligence Agency's

Mexico City Station.

Charles Thomas' First Meeting with Elena Garro’ Where Lee

 

Harvey Oswald is Discussed

 

On 12/10/65 Charles Thomas, a political officer at
the American Embassy, wrote a memorandum about a conhversa-
tion with Elena Garro de Paz. (CIA #586-587, WX-7241 Entry
No. 425, p. 91, CIA No. 718.) The meeting with Elena had
been about other matters but she mentioned knowing Oswald.
Thomas noted that she was reluctant to talk but did. (Ibid.)

Elena's story reported here is the same, but with

more details, as that given in the Licookie memo dated

he was in Mexico because she had met Oswald “and two
friends (Cubans)"at a party at Horacio Duran's house.

(Ibid.) In addition, the informant claimed that Elena

 

also told her story to an American official, at the Em-
bassy, who claimed to represent the Warren Commission.
(Ibid.) The Chief of Station noted that he had asked
the informant to pursue the story (Ibid.) but there is
no indication that LICHANT I ever complied with this re-

quest. (HSCA Review of Classified CIA Documents.)

November 24, 1964 Elena Meeting with Mexico City Legal

 

Attache Officers

 

Elena and her daughter also told their story to
cote the Mexico City Legal Attache. (The Legal Attache in
1964 was Clark Anderson.) ‘They recounted the same story
previously given to LICOOKIE I. The date of the party
was given as September 30,:October 1 or October 2, 1963.
(FBI 105-825555 Report, Dec. 11, 1964 entitled Lee Harvey
Oswald, p. 1) The agent who wrote the report (

) noted that Lee Harvey Oswald could not have
been identical with the American allegedly observed by
Mrs. Paz at the party if this party were held on the even-
ing of October 1 or October 2, 1963. (FBI 103-825555
Report, Dec. 11, 1964 entitled Lee Harvey Oswald, p- 1)

FBI investigation of President Kennedy's assassination

had established that Lee Harvey Oswald had departed Mexico
 

‘City by bus at 8:30 a.m. on Octber 2, 1963 when Ms.
Paz stated that she saw Lee Harvey Oswald walking on
Insurgentes. (Ibid. p.3)

Elena was questioned regarding the identity of
ther persons attending the party at the Ruben Duran home
who might have been in a position to observe the three
Americans. Elena stated that in the course of the party
her daughter met a young man named "Alejandro" at the
party and danced with him. (Ibid. p.3)/ The daughter did‘
not take the calls and as a result "Alejandro" wrote

(Ibid., p. 3)
several letters to the daughter./ Ms. Garro exhibited
two of the letters, as well as a business card which i-
dentified the young man as Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius.
(Ibid. p. 3)

The letter which Ms. Garro said was the first writ-
ten by the young man to her daughter bore the date Septem-
ber 1, 1963 and the Mexico City Post Office postmark Septem-
ber 2, 1963. When Ms. Garro was told this she commented
that the Communists probably had facilities for falsifying
postcards. (Ibid.)

To investigate Ms. Garro's story further, the
Federal Bureau interviewed Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius
on November 27, 1964. (Ibid. p.4) Lavagnini recalled that
there were approximately thirty people at the Ruban Duran

party, few of whom he knew. He recalled having met a Mexi-

The day after the party, Elena and Deba saw the
three Americans on the Insurgent a main avenue in Mexico
City.) The Garros claimed that they had recognized Oswald's
photograph when it was published after the assassination. (Ibid.)
Sylvia Duran's arrest “underlined the Garros' certainty"
that the ma had been Lee Harvey Oswald. (Ibid.)

Deba added that Lynn and one of the Duran brothers
had made trips to Texas. (Ibid.) She added that, even
though the Duran brothers had always been poor before
the assassination, they were both driving expensive new
cars. (Ibid.)

The source of the memo was a witting Central intelli-
gence Agency asset known by the eryptonym LICOOKIE I whom
the Committee identified as June Cobb Sharp while receiv-
ing LICOOKIE's file. According to Elena, Ms. Cobb was
sent to her house shortly after the assassination for a
few days, by a mutual friend, a Costa Rican writer Eunice
Odio. (CIA No's 580-583; WX-7241, Entry #427, p. 92, CIA
#719) Ms. Garro asserted that while at her house, Ms.

Cobb expressed interest in the Kennedy assassination./ One
night Elena's sister Deba, who was visiting, got drunk and
told the whole story. (Ibid.) Claiming to be a CIA agent,
Cobb suggested that Elena and Deba go to Texas to tell

their story. (Ibid.) Elena stated that when Cobb's sugges~-

tion was rejected, Cobb stated that she would arrange a meet—

FoOn A:

wo F On October 12, 1964 the Chief of Covert Action, Jim . .

Flannery, wrote a memo for the record reporting that Elena FED

Garro de Paz had told her story to Eunice Odio. (The Com-
mittee has not been able to determine if Elena Garro told
Ms. Odio the story personally or if Ms. Cobb related to
Ms. Odio what Elena had. told her) : who relayed it to "Tich-
horn! /Tichborn was Henry P. Lopez! cryptonym. Mr. Lopez
was a witting asset who: wrote “propaganda: pteces>for-the CIA.

The story is not as detailea as the 10/5/64 version.
There is no mention of Deba Garro Guerrero Galvan. The
story, perhaps because it is third hand, differs from the
previous story in two areas: The party was at the Cuban

Embassy, not at Ruben Duran's; Elena talked to a Cuban

ing with the CIA Station Chief. (Winston Scott was the
Mexico City Station Chief in 1964). The meeting did not
occur because Ms. Cobb was asked to leave the Garro
house evidently because she kicked Elena's cat. (CIA
No's 580-583; Wx7241, Entry #427, p. 42, CIA #719). A
notation on the memo says that L/l (Licookie I) never re-
‘gained contact with Elena Garro de Paz. (Wx7241, p. 94,
Entry #430, CIA #721; Blind Memo dated 10/5/64, CIA #576).

The LiCookie memo was not inserted in either the

Elena Garro or Lee Harvey Oswald "p" (personality) files

' but in a local leftist and Cuban project file. The Com-
mittee learned about the memo from Wx-7241, a chronologi-
cal history of the Oswald case prepared by Anne Goodpasture
for the CIA in 1976). The memo was found in December,
1965. (See Wx 7241, p. 94, CIA #721). Stanley Watson
found the memo. A marginal notation on Wx7241 says, "Why

was this not sent to Headquarters?" (P. 87, CIA #714). The

Committee has been able to determine that the memo was for-

Embassy official, not one of her cousins about the three
Americans.

Attached to the memo was a note from Flannery to
the Chief of Station, Winston Scott, which read, "Do you
want me to send the gist of this to Headquarters?" Scott
then noted that the memo should be filed. The file indi-
cations show that the memo went into the Oswald "P" file

and the Elena Garro "P" file. (Ibid.)

November 24, 1964 CIA Informant Report
