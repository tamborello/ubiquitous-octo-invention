SUBJECT : Length of Time Required for Obtaining Soviet Tourist
Visas in Helsinki and Stockholm, 1964

1. In response to a telephone inquiry concerning the time required
(July 1964) for issuance of a Soviet visa for a US busineseman, the Soviet
consul in Helsinki stated that he could issue a transit visa (valid for 24
hours) in five minutes but that for a longer stay he would need about a
week to process a visa application and have Inturist arrange for lodgings.
He implied that the main reason for delays in visa issuances was a shortage
of hotel epace in the USSR.

is able to obtain Soviet tourist visas for his customere within five days if
he pushes the matter.

: 1964 revealed that normal visa processing there takes eeven days but that
this can be shortened to five days “in exceptional cases." The Soviet
! official receiving the telephone call stated that it wae impossible to get a
visa within two or three days.

4. A Soviet official in Stockholm indicated in 1964 that visa processing
for foreigners wishing to visit the USSR normally takes six to eight days in
Stockholm but that visas for Swedish businessmen and other personalities
: of special interest (not defined) can be processed directly by the Soviet
i embaesy in Stockholm without referral to Moscow.
