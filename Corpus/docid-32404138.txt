MEMORANDUM FOR: The Director of Central Intelligence

FROM: Stanley M. Moskowitz .
Director of Congressional Affairs

SUBJECT: DCI Testimony on JFK Assassination
Materials Disclosure Act

1. You and FBI Director Sessions are scheduled to testify
on 12 May before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee at a
hearing on S.J. Res. 282, the "Assassination Materials Disclosure
Act of 1992." Your appearance will follow a congressional panel
of witnesses cotisisting of Senators Boren and Specter (who was a
counsel to the Warren Commission) and Congressman Stokes. The
Committee will conclude its hearing with a panel of witnesses
consisting of Professor Ernest May, of Harvard's Kennedy School
of Government; History Professor Athan Theoharis, of Marquette
University; and James Lesar, President of the locally based
Assassination Archive and Research Center. Your opening
statement with your suggested revisions has been provided to OMB
for Administration coordination.

2. The Department of Justice will not be sending a witness
to testify before the Committee. The Committee has requested
that the Department at least send a representative to assist
Director Sessions, who does not intend to address major policy
and legal issues raised by the joint resolution. Senator Glenn
will not ask you to comment on the constitutional objections to
the joint resolution raised by the Department of Justice, but
other Members of the Committee, such as Senator Levin, may raise
these issues.

3. You should be aware that there is a disagreement between
CIA and the FBI regarding what constitutes assassination
materials. We have taken the position that all the sequestered
House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). materials
constitute assassination material. FBI Director Sessions has
taken the position in his opening statement that assassination
material should include only "core" records directly related to
the assassination (e.g., records on Oswald and Ruby} and that an
additional 265,000 pages of material requested by the HSCA
covering organized crime and other criminal investigations should
not be considered assassination material since it does not shed
any light on who killed Kennedy. It is likely that you and
Director Sessions will be asked about these differing positions,
sO you may wish’to.discuss this with Director Sessions in

advance. LA
