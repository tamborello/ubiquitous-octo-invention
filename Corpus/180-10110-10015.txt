Identifying Information:

Name David Atlee Phillips. . Telephone 365-2238

Address

 

Type of Contact: xx Telephone
__ Person

Summary of Contact:
I called Mr. Phillips to ask him about his testimony on 11/27/76 that there

 

were two or three cameras covering the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in 1963.

 

Mr. Phillips said that he was not absolutely sure about that but his

 

recollection was that there were two cameras. One covered the Embassy

 

entgrance because they were interested in the political visitors, and the

 

other covered the Consulate because they were interested in people who

 

were traveling to Cuba. He said his recollection is reinforced by his

 

memory of going back over the photos looking for Oswald after the assass9

 

nation when he knew that Oswald had been at the Consulate. He said that

a

it may have been that there was a manned photo base covering the Embassy
Mr.

entrance and an "impulse" camera covering the consulate entrance.

 

Phillips was not sure about when Saturday coverage was instituted. He

was sure that the Embassy and Consulate would have been covered during

 

business hours, at least. ~
