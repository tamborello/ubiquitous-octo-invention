MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
FROM: John Carver

Boxes 1-6 of the Lee Harvey Oswald 201 File

Last minute details this morning: }

1 In telephone calls with Frank Most, got confirmation that no House-originated documents are
included in these first six boxes. All of the original reviewers of these--Frank, Jim, Gloria, Bill, and Barry--
believe there there is no such material in these boxes. The IMS index of documents in the Oswald 201 was also
checked and turned up no House documents. (There are, of course, many such documents in the JFK sequestered
files.) HRG will add a special step in its processing procedures to make sure we handle all Congressionally
originated documents separately and properly.

2. In telephone calls with Chuck Lane, I first (about 9:00 A.M.) asked him to hold up the six
boxes for an hour or so to let us ascertain in our index review that we wouldn't have to make a last-minute
physical check to make sure there were no House documents in them. This disturbed him, as IMD had made
special efforts to get them out the door for NARA by noon. Jim Cunningham had ordered everybody to move as
fast as possible; special calls went to Larry McDonald and possibly to Trudy Peterson to make sure NARA was
ready to receive the shipment. After we finished the index check in HRG and got clearance from John Pereira and
Page Moffett, I called Chuck back, thanked him for the delay (about 35 minutes), and said all was clear to go
ahead and deliver the boxes. I passed on thanks to IMD for their special handling.

3. In telephone calls with Page Moffett, I explained how we were ascertaining that no House
documents were included in this batch. (We were interrupted by a call from the Director to Page.) Page said he
was satisfied that we are safe on this score, but he asked that HRG arrange to give any Congressional documents
we find special handling; he suggested that we pull any such documents from the files and store them separately.

4. In telephone calls with John Pereira, I first left a message to let him know what we were doing
and what IMD was planning to do today. By the time he called back, Frank had confirmed that the Oswald boxes
are clean, and Page Moffett had given his blessing. John passed on information from his talks with Page, David
Pearline, and Mark Mansfield. (They have drafted a letter or an announcement for Gates's signature on the
delivery of these boxes to NARA.) After our meeting today, John will send a note around on a new HRG
procedure to handle House (and Senate) documents that turn up in our review for any boxes after the first six.

5. Ina telephone call with Larry McDonald, I got his promise that NARA reviewers will be alert
for any Congressional documents that might unaccountably have been included in these six boxes and will let CIA
know immediately if they discover any. ,

6. John Pereira had not yet heard back from Steve Tilley. John called back later with the message
from David Van Tassel that NSC's review is complete. There are a few points of disagreement (some pieces sof
information that Jack Wright has stated must continue to be protected; some documents which require further
coordination with third agencies), but NSC has agreed with most of our determinations. He was drafting a cover
memo (at 10:55) and he would have the package ready for us in a couple of hours. Jim will arrange to pick the
package up personally as soon as we get the word. We may have to make some last minute redactions. The
CPAS deadline for printing up 7000 copies of the package is still "today."
