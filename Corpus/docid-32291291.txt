MM 92-515

MM 606-C related that HYMAN MARTIN (Miami file 92-218)
indicated he was going to take $27,000 of JAMES CHRISTIAN's
number business from Broward County and try to give it to FRED
CHAPMAN, to see if he could take it. He also advised that JAMES
CHRISTIAN told HYMAN MARTIN that he wanted to quit working the
numbers operation but he was advised by MARTIN to keep on as his
legal fees, as a result of his arrest, for attorney for trial
would come “off the top" of the numbers operation, whereas
CHRISTIAN would have to stand the expense himself if he quit
the numbers racket now.

 

MM 509-C advised that the Sportsman Billiard Parlor,
23rd and Collins, Miami Beach, a hoodlum hangout, operated by
JOHN ANGERSOLA (Miami file 92-100) and managed by JOHN ZANETTI,
a nephew of ANGERSOLA, closed and undoubtedly will not reopen,

 

; He also reported that NAT FARBER (Miami file 92-118)
sold his trailer court in Miami recently.
