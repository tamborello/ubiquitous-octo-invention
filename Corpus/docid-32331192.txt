{nm connection with information furnished by Chaet
BLICK At is likely that the Se eee vere at 1915 Biltmore

gaze the dame night.

In view of the above developments At appears that
the dice gane at Ripley, Maryland, hao bees abandoned for
the present. Lnassuch as the operation at 1915 Biltmore
Street involves substamtially the same individuals as were
involved in the Ripley, Maryland, operation, it is likely
that thé Site Lor the game has boem moved. Acsordingly it
ig recommonded that the office of origin be changed fren

Baltimore to WFO since it appears that the operation has been ~

moved LFoh Ripley, Maryland, to tho District of Colunbia.
Extra copies are provided for the Bureau for notification to
Ealtinore and WHO of the change.
