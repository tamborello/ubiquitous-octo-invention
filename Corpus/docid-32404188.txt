SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Records
Proposed Regulations

1. Attached for your review and comment is a copy of
proposed regulations prepared by the JFK Assassination
Records Review Board. The regulations focus on the
definition of “assassination record”, which is very broad.
The possibility of requiring additional records searches is
raised. :

2. The Board plans to discuss the regulations at its
next meeting on 6-7 March, so it would be helpful to give
the Board our input in advance of that meeting. Please
provide Barry Harrelson (x30292) or me (x30373) with your
comments by 1 March.
