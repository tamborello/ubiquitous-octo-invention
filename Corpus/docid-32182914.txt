in Mexico of LEE-HARVEY OSWALD and a large number of

allegations which developed in this. country in connection
with OSWALD and the assassination of President JOHN F.

:. KENNEDY. While an effort has been. made to document. as fully.

as possible the. sources of information relating to the report,
in several instances this office received information from |
the Bureau or a domestic: field office by telephone or cable,..-
with respect to which it was not possible to establish full —
and complete documentation as to sources of that information; —
however, in order to make the summary complete, more readable.
and more corngruous, some items ef information were utilized -
in the summary without the usual decumentation thereof. In.
those instances, the information, as summarized, was attributed
to the Mexico City Legal Attache's files; .

All the information of substance appearing. in the
enchosed letterhead memorandum has been reported previously
to the Bureau in form suitable for dissemination, |

A great deal of information appears in the Legal
Attache’ s files which was received from the Mexico City
Station of CIA with the admonition that it "not be. disseminated"
outside the Bureau, and this information has not been included

-in the summary letterhead memorandum. uch of the above data Bi)

related to the results of [CIA technical] coverage of the Soviet
and Cuban diplomatic establishments in lexico City and has

been reported to the Bureau by this office. There also is
reason to believe that. this information ‘has been disseminated

to the Bureau by the Central Headquarters of CEA and to the
President's Investigating Commission by that agency; therefore,
that information and data are not being incor orated in the ,
Administrative Section of this cover letter /” _

Investigation by Bureau Agents ©

As the Bureau is aware, early phases of the inves-—
tigation in Mexico of the travel and activities of OSWALD
were handled by various agencies of the Mexican Government
and also by symbol informants of this office. . Since Mexican
Government investigators were contacting numerous sources of

. it “was observed in several instances that: Agents

were able to gain the confidence of persons whom they had

- to interview on more than one occasion, as required by new

., developments and additional basis: for inquiry, and when new -
‘and pertinent data not furnished at previous interviews was

. obtained and inquiry was made as to why such information
‘had not been provided earlier, the characteristic ‘reply

WARY "You didn't ask me." -

eS _ While the following is well known to the Bureau,
it is considered worthy of mention that the investigation

- yeported in the enclosure is based on interviews conducted. .

documents and signed statements in Spanish and in accordance -

: _ Because of the effective ‘liaigon of this: office
. with the Mexican Ministry of Gobernacion, it was possible © .

'.¢o ‘borrow originals and copies of key documents in-the files.
of that Ministry, although on the supervisory level from

where the documents were obtained, there was considerable’
resistance to the numerous requests of this office which
required voluminous file searches for documents and to allowing
them to physically leave the premises of the Ministry in

the possession of Buread liaison personnel for copying and
study. — ;

“tt is desired to assure the Bureau that all: tnves-

that investigative activity of this type by Bureau Agents
over an extended period of time inevitably would cause serious
