; It was requested that an additional inquiry
be made by the Legal Attache, London, in recontact
with their source to ascertain. if ANGELO BRUNO possibly .
held other insurance besides that tesulting in the $185,000
claim being paid 4/59, $70,000 of which was reinsured by
Lloyds of London. () :

. Extensive inquiry in this regard has developed
that there was a $185,000payment made by the American:
International Insurance Company, #258 Havana Street, .
Havana, Cuba, As set forth herein, this policy was
No. 303-806-F, [However, the point of inquiry to Legal
Attache, London,. should be to establish if ANGELO BRUNO
was the recipient of this $185,000 payment, less adjust-
ments, or if JOSEPH STASSI.was recipient of this payment
considering that Legal Attache, London, prior communication
on 4/27/61 relates that Col, CUMMING had advised that the
subject had received the $185,000 payment 1/6)

. Ee is requested that the Legal Attache, London,
clarify whether BRUNO or STASSI received the money and
any additional information available that could possibly
be developed further in the United States which could

ultimately prove to be of evidentiary value against teh

ANGELO BRUNO. t should be noted that BRUNO has been
designated by’ the Bureau as the target of "early ,
and therefore is the subject of concentrated Bureau
investigative ENO
