Synopsis: JFK Task Force returning file(s) to Louisville.
“Details: Enclosed for Louisville are the following file(s):

LS 66-2541
LS 100-00 Serials 1765 & 1766

The originals removed from these files and replaced
with duplicate copies of the original were accessioned to the
National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) pursuant to 4
the JFK Records Collection Act of 1992. Provision of the JFK Act
allowed for certain information to be postponed from public
-release until the year 2017; therefore, the pages have NOT
necessarily been released for public review in their entirety.

Under the JFK Act, originals to all material deemed
assassination records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of
whether the material is open in full or released with information
postponed. Therefore, any documents or pages from FBI files
accessioned to NARA pursuant to the JFK Act are no longer
considered the possession of the FBI. The duplicate pages have
been inserted strictly for research purposes.

The copies contained within the previously mentioned
file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date
