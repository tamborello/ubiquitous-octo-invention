4. ‘the report also states that ODYOKE has conditioned its support
to Cuban resistance groups on their channeling their activities through :
the FRD. Secret training camps, set up by ODYOKE, presumably in Guatemala |
and other countries in the Caribbean area, have been operating for the
past six months and already approximately 1,000 Cubans have received
training to take part in the principal invasion forces. Persons trained
in subversion have been infiltrated into Cuba from these camps. Pilots
' have been trained to man an air farce which now numbers approximately
80 modern ODYOKE planes. As reinforcements ODYOKE has also trained
: 5,000 or 6,000 Puerto Ricans, who, disguised as Cubans, vill take part —
B in the invasion. Once the invasion takes place, the report continues,
, ODYOKE has prozised to supply the invaders with the materials necessary
te maintain ite impetus. If the Commnist bloc should provide massive
support to Castro, the ODYOKE officials in contact with the Cuban ‘
-¥esistance groupe have implied that ODYOKE would openly intervene. .

6. the report also contains estimates of the strength of resiatance
Groups inside Cuba, the loyalty of the Cuban armed forces to Fidel Castro,
and general comments on the composition of the revolutionary groups

which form the FRD. :

   
 
     
  

T. It is not know at this time what plans if any the Spanish
goverment my have for continued liaison with Cuban resistance groups,
or whether they anticipate lending more concrete support other than the
moral support already ieplied by their consenting to scud this initial
mission. [QUANTIM/30jhas indicated that there is no present plan for
personnel support.

  
        
 

; 8. It is requested that this dispatch and its attachment be brought
' te the attention of the Cuban and Spanish desk reports sections in order
_ that any ne tive intelligence it contains may be disseminated,

j which the (asta) station is not in a position to determine. We judge
that. tte_prineipal_interest lies in the fact that the Spanish governieit”
has_established-lieieon «ith the resistance groups and its possible
knowledgeability, asa. result, of ODYOKE covert plans and operations in

the Cuban area
