A, THE UN PROPOSITIONS FOR CNA PARTICIPATION IN KATANGA OPERATIONS

DO NOT EXACTLY CORRESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT OF CONGO (GOC) PROPOSALS,
THE PRINCIPAL PROPOSAL BEING THE PLACEMENT OF CNA TROOPS AT THE
KAMINA BASE. (SOURCE COMMENT: MOBUTU CONSIDERS KAMINA THE MOST
IMPORTANT STRATEGIC POINT IN KATANGA,) WITHOUT POSSESSION OF THIS
STRATEGIC POINT, NEGOTIATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT OF KATANGA (GOK)

PERMIT THE GOC To:

ENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHIEF KASONGO-NIEMBO;

Pd LULUABOURG AND ELISABETHVILLE {F CNA TROOPS LAUNCHED A GROUND ATTACK
"IN KATANGA FROM LULUABOURG; AND

GIVE THE CNA A BASE FROM WHICH TO MOVE AGAINST SOUTH KATANGA

| VIA BUKWAMA AND KOLWEZI.

B, TO SUPPORT THIS OPERATION, THE CNA CAN PROVIDE A BRIGADE
COMPOSED OF THE FOLLOWING TROOPS: 3RD COMMANDO BATTALION, 8TH
INFANTRY BATALLION, 13TH INFANTRY BATALLION, 2ND RECONNAISANCE
SQUADRON, HALF A COMPANY OF COMBAT ENGINEERS, AND THE 17TH INFANTRY
BATALLION FOR GUARD DUTY, THE 2ND RECONNAISANCE SQUADRON AND THE.

"3RD COMMANDO BATALLION ARE STANDING BY IN. LULUABOURG

AND ARE READY TO DEPART IMMEDIATELY. THE REMAINING TROOPS CAN BE
CONCENTRATED AT LULUABOURG ON 48 HOURS NOTICE,  *

C, THE MOVEMENT OF THESE TROOPS DEPENDS EXCLUSIVELY ON UNOC,

J MEANS OF COORDINATING THE GENERAL KATANGA OPERATION CAN BE DISCUSSED
AFTER THE CNA TROOPS ARE AT KAMINA BASE, HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE

7 A MISTAKE TO WAIT FOR THE END OF SUCH DISCUSSIONS BEFORE TRANSPORTING |
THE . TROOPS, ‘WHICH MOVEMENT WOULD ITSELF STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE COURSE.
OF THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH UNOC.

GOC MUST BE PRUDENT IN ITS DEMANDS FOR THE MOMENT. THE UNOC PROPOSALS

 

IMPLY A TOTAL ABANDONMENT OF GOC AUTHORITY OVER THE TROOPS PUT AT
THE DISPOSAL OF UNOC AS THE OBJECTIVES OF THE UN COULD DIFFER

FROM THOSE OF THE GOC AND AS THE UN, UNDER THE PRESSURE OF CERTAIN
INFLUENTIAL MEMBER STATES, COULD CEASE TO PROSECUTE THE KATANGAN
OPERATION, THiS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR THE GOC TO OBTAIN. FORMAL

"GUARANTEES FROM UNOC BEFORE AGREEING TO ITS PROPOSALS.

_E. GENERAL MOBUTU DOES NOT BELIEVE INTEGRATION OF CNA TROOPS with
UNOC TROOPS iS WISE, COORD i NATION ONLY TO ACHIEVE COMMON GOC/UNOC
OBJECTIVES WILL LEAVE THE GOC,IN THE EVENT DIFFERENCES ARISE WITH UNOC

WITHOUT

LIBERTY OF ACTION; UNOC CONTINGENTS PRESENTLY IN KATANGA HAD TO
BE INTEGRATED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THEIR EFFECTIVE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT,
BUT THE CNA IS ON ITS OWN TERRITORY. AND HAS EXISTING BASES AND

LINES OF SUPPLY FOR MUNITIONS AND EQUIPMENT, INTEGRATION WOULD

TAKE AWAY FROM THE CNA ITS NATIONAL CHARACTER AND WEAKEN THE GOC'S
DIPLOMATIC POSTURE VIS A VIS THE UN AND FOREIGN POWERS.

F. THE ONLY IMPORTANT AND IMMEDIATE GOC REQUIREMENT 1S AIR
TRANSPORT FOR TAKING THE CNA TROOPS TO KAMINA. ALL OTHER ASSISTANCE
CAN BE DECIDED THROUGH DISCUSSION WITH UNOC AFTER THE TROOPS HAVE -
ARRIVED, IN HELPING TRANSPORT CNA TROOPS TO KAMINA, UNOC WILL BE

FURTHERING ITS OWN OBJECTIVE: THE DEFINITE ENDING OF KATANGA'S

SECESSION.
