RE: CUBANOS UNIDOS
(UNITED CUBANS)

fasoline storage plants and electric plants in Cuba.
However, CU has not formalized these plans, and they are
not expected to take place within the immediate future.

NAVARRO explained that he had been, appearing
on radio and television programs in the Miami, Florida, area,
calling for unity of Cuban exile groups and urging these
independent groups to join CU for military operations
against Cuba, NAVARRO said that CU takes the propaganda
position that it is.against any United States help and aid
and will liberate Cuba without: United States arms, backing
or recognition. NAVARRO explained the purpose of this
policy is to unite the Cuban exiles, but privately CU is
trying to obtain United States Government help and. backing.

On June 23, 1970, MM T~1 advised that certain CU
members claim that they had located a good boat, about
sixty feet long with a steel hull and two motors, The boat
is owned by an unidentified American, MM T=1 explained
that from the contents of the conversation, it appeared
that the CU members planned on contacting the American :
owner of the boat to ascertain if arrangements could be Lie)

‘made for CU to use this boat for operations against Cuba.

Fon June 26, 1970, MM T=-2, a Cuban exile who has
been involved in C ‘revolutionary matters for the past
five years, advised}that on the night previously, he had
conferred with WILFREDO NAVARRO, at which time NAVARRO
claimed CU was going ahead with its plans to sink a
Soviet vessel off the east coast of Florida’ as the vessel
was.on its way to Cuba. NAVARRO- indicated that CU had no
particular vessel: in mind, but that when plans .were completed
they would attempt to sink the first Russian vessel that
happened to come along.

On June 29, 1970, MM T-1 reported that he received
information that CU was preparing. some type of military
action against ships trading with Cuba. This action would
involve an attack ona ship on the high ‘seas and possibly |
a ship of Russian registry, The leaders of this operation
are WILFREDO NAVARRO ‘and GORDON DI BATTISTO, an American,

CU reportedly had two 20mm cannons, two .50 caliber
machine guns, and an unidentified boat, owned by an
American, not further Mdentitied. (X Yu)
