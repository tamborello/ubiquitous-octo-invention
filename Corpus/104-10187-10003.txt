CD feplscenent for Arnold F, AREHART during Hore Leave

 

TY REQUIRED ROPLALNCES:
Reference: HMMA 23522

1. Referenced dispatch which reflected the Station's apprecias
tion of Newten T. RITSAY'S high level of performance during his
recent TPY in Mexico and requested his return TDY was brought to
the attention of the appropriate KURTOT officials.

2. Unfortunately, RUTSAY will not he available to replace
AREHART -during the latter's home leave period in the fall of 1964;——--
and KURIOT has ne one else they can release for a prolonged period
this fall. Since the leave probably will only be about two ronths,
Peadouarters wonders whether a technician is absolutely required,

Does the Station believe that an operations officer, with sone
Spanish and who could rarcly take over the acministrative work and
pake the Station contacts, couid fill in during this period?

3. We are not sanguine that a replacement can be made avail-
able particularly since: the man will of necessity need toa be
“exposable" to ligisen, but will try our best to find one, In the
meantire, please forward the exact dates it is desired the hoped
for man should be in “exico to allow for adequate overlap.
