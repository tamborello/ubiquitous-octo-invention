one of HOFFA's close assistants in the 1960s who may have

PRESIDENT KENNEDY.

Based upon source's relationships with past LCN bosses,
source commented that if RAGANO's claims about an. LCN contract
against PRESIDENT KENNEDY were true, RAGANO would have been
killed by the LCN years ago. Based on RAGANO's claims that HOFFA,

after PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S assassination. This would have been
done to prevent RAGANO from identifying either HOFFA or
