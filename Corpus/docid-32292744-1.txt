KORSHAK got ahold of him and he's telling him what to do."
This is believed to refer to a luncheon engagement which took
place on 2/25/63 which was attended by PCI MIKE IGOE,
Alderman D'ARCO, PAT HOY, and one or two other individuals,
at which time HOY was instructed to see that persons involved
in this situation employed at the Hilton Hotel did not make any
comments to any investigators concerning the situation.
Shortly thereafter ART PETAQUE joined MARCY and made
arrangements to interview FIO RITO with the proviso that he
would write a favorable story regarding him. It is pointed
out that on 2/23/63 PETAQUE met with MARCY and made —
arrangements to write a story favorable to the First Ward
situation and FIO RITO and was given a monetary gift despite
his objections by MARCY. .

Election Commissioner HOLTZMAN has ruled that to be
eligible to be elected as an Alderman that the only residence
requirement is that the individual elected reside in the Ward
the day he is elected. From this ruling it is obvious that
MARCY has misinterpreted the rule. All of this consternation
with the papers has resulted from this misinterpretation, the
net result obviously lowering MARCY's position with the hoodlums.
