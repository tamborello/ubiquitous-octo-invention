Metiorandum Wannall to Sullivan

Re; UNSUBS; ATTEMPT TO DYNAMITE THE BRITISH euryerHt AL
FREIGHTER. “LANCASTRIAN PRINCESS" ON HIGH Nyuset AL
SEAS, 8/28/68

no suspicious persons were observed in the water or anywhere in
vicinity of vessel at any of the U.S, ports despite the fact that
his officers and crew had been ‘alerted by the ship's owners to
beware of possible Cuban saboteurs. The Captain advised that he
received instructions from the ship's owners to put into Miami to
have the vessel checked for a bomb as the result of a Coast
Guard alert.

Miami Office pointed out that the dynamite in this case
did not explode because it was simulated dynamite furnished to
Bosch with Bureau_approval by a cooperative Miami source who was

4 approached by. -Bosch for explosives.

The Department of State was advised of the bomb attempt
on the evening of 8/28/6&and State was authorized to furnish the

information [to the #British. We are advising MI-5. C)

Immediate and vigorous investigation has been instituted
and you will be kept advised of pertinent developments. Miami
has requested local agencies and the vessel's Captain.to treat
this matter confidentially since the security and life of our
source could be jeopardized,

OBSERVATIONS :

Previous investigation has indicated that Bosch's group
has threatened to bomb ships of countries trading with Cuba, and
previous memoranda recommended and approved that the Miami Office
pass simulated dynamite to Bosch. It would appear from the fore-
going that Bosch or members. of his group constructed the bomb with
the simulated dynamite. Our action in making the dynamite available
to him in this instance has -«.’probably saved the lives of the crew
of the "Lancastrian Princess," prevented the vessel from receiving
serious. bomb damage and has prevented the U.S. from being placed in
a. most embarrassing position. -

ACTION:

This is for your information. We are pressing all aspects.

of this matter in effort to obtain admissable evidence of crime on
the high seas violation against | Bosch and any members of his organi~
zation involved.
