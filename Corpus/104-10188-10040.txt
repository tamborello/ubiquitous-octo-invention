LIFEAT/ERiIe - LIFEAT coverage of ESLARD-1 has been must rewarding in
terms.of his contacts, travel, and future plans, This information
has ‘been of interest to Headquarters, LIFEAT has exerted every effort
to provide continuing coverage of this target even when ESLARD-1
resided in a hotel under an alias and following his move to new
quarters, Coverage by .LIFEAT was especially difficult during E-i's
Stay at the hotel sinoe the technical problems were considerable and
the processing of all calls to and from the hotel in order to extract
E-l's calls was a heavy burden on the LIFEAT processor/translator
staff, It is noted that in Station's opinion the LIFEAT complex
showed up particularly well in this assignment,

     

 

 

LIFEAT coverage or Inas been especially
fruitful concerning the travel and contacts of Costa Rican Communists,
including their travel to Cuba, It has also provided some leads
concerning ZRKNICK operation, .

LIFEAT/American Communist Group in Mexico {ACGM) - During the reporting
period local ODENVY requested that LIFEAT coverage be initiated on_
David DRUCKER, prominent member of the ACGM, Product from this t
coverage, in conjunction with that coverage already being provided
on Charles SMALL (aka SMOLIKOFF), is valuable to ODENVY tn providing
data_on U.S, Communists who travel to Mexice and contact the xembers
of the ACCM, Information is also provided on the daily activities ;
and contacts of members of the ACGM. ‘

LIFEAT/Miscellaneous ~- Coverage of a former SMOTH agent at the
request of Headquarters resulted in the knowledge that this former
agent was in contact ‘ith a number of Soviet Satellite personalities
and was exerting a strong influence on a friend of his, a PRPRIME -
citizen employed as the Local representative of a well mown PBPRIME
news media, It became apparent that the PBPRIME citizen, through :

SMOTH agent in an attempt to “destroy” the senior ODACID official
in Mexico, Early warning to this official resulted in action which
greatly diminished the effect of this effort, Coverage of both the |
former SMOTH agent and the PRPRIME citizen is being continued,

i, Since the LIFEAY Project Renewal Request forwarded by referance (a)
contained a thorough review of the LIFEAT project for the entire project year
through May 1963, most of the {tems of interest to the project were included in
the review through that date, The following report contains those items not
fully reported or not inaluded in that review plus items of interest occuring
‘during June 1963." Except for the abcve noted period, LIFEAT progress reports
‘generally ill be forwarded on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis,

2. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSRIB-F 52-6-1,
seotion V, paragraph 2 (a) (2).

A. EXPLOITATION OF LEADS

@) LIFEAT/Soviet + During the reporting period LIFEAT has
eontinued its daily soverage of the home phones of two known
Soviet .intelligence officers, Information and leads from this
Coverage provide the interested Station Officer with a valuable
oheck on the Soviet contacts of several KUBARK controlled
double agents, There is also provided the type of information
on daily activities of Soviet personnel without which the plan-
ning for and successful completion of the technical surveillance
operation against one of these Soviets would have been impossible
Station believes that LIFEAT contribution to the success of this

” operation deserves particular mention,

B. PROCESSING oF TAKE

. Due to the heavy workload shared by the present LIFEAT processor/
transiater staff. it was decided that an additional egent was needed
' for-these duties, Station review of a numcer o. agent candidates to
fill chis position was unczrtaxen and one individual was selected,
See paragraph 2 C below.

C. PERSoosy,
Provisional operational approval was requested on LIFEUD-28 an 29 May

."1963 to fill the need noted in paragraph 2 B above, Recruitment will
_ be undertaken xhen such “approval is received,

 

As the end of May as éalled ‘into the ‘6ffices of
and told that since’ he has
passed the retirement age (EIFEUD-1 is 63 years old) “roo must be
“ae wade for youriser men", A retirement payment was agreed upon which, when
all benefits are included, equals to approximately 70 to & percent of
_ Ure S base salary, After the retirement plan wes agreed upon,
> the in a private conversation, asked LIFEUD-1
to accept” a spec commission as part-time investigator conserned
with acrinistrative personnel at 2,000 pesos per month, LIFEUD-1
accepted this comission,

The above action will reduce LIFEUD-1's access to the (ora.
here most LIFEAT tap] ss |were made, The extent of this
reduction can only be determined after LIFEUD-1 works his special
commission for a period of time. As @ preliminary opinion, end not
a@ final decision, it is believed that LIFEUD-2's knowledge of and contacts
in og coupled with hig new position as personnel
investigator, will continue to make his contribution to the LIFEAT
project valuable and possibly unique. (See paragraph 2 E below re
security aspects of LIFEUD-1's retirement),

  

 

 

 

 

 

BD. LIAO

In late Kay 196% local ODENVY requested coverage be instituted on

David DRUCKER, OQDOFNVY is to process tne take as on other ACGM coverages,
This coverace was installed 2 June 1963. No other change from that
noted in reference (b).

E, SECURITY
(1) In the security area the ret trement of LIFEUD-1 and the events

surrounding it have produced two dangers to the operation which
erfect bot security and efficiency, The first of these involves

 
  
  
 
 

 

 

the reduction of LIFEAT access to the Formerly
LIFEVD-1 could, by call arrange

for LIFELD-16 to ente and whide engaged in normal work
there e&tablish a tap on a LIFFAT target line. ‘Tapping

method used in LIFEAT operations, It is considered less time ¢.

. In a related incident during a discussion of his retirement
with LIFECD-1, it became apparent that he” beiteved tial LICQACH was
providing backup protection to the entire LIFEAT complex. LIFEUD~1
based ikis assumption on the fact that at one time he had discussed
provicing LiTZAT with hich level protection with a former LIFEAT Case
Officer end later learned that this Case Officer had visited LICOSCH
on a mrber of occasions, From this LIFED-1 deduced that LICOACH _
was in contact with the former LIFEAT Case Officer in order to

which LIFFUD-1 conducted for the approximately
nine years ago. At no time has LIFSUD-1 mentiondd LIFZAT operatious
ote LICOAC « Since LICOACH returned to his native Western European
country 1 dune 1963, LIFEUD-1 will not be told that LICOACH was not
in LIFEAT employ, Hower, LIFEUD-1 has been reminded never to
speak with anyone about LIFEAT without firs. discussing it with

some access, but most LIFEAT tap crosses will of necessity be

made in the This until such time as a+
method to get around the “work order” system is developed or this
system falls of its own weight due to the Mexican "manafia" attitude,
Making crosses in distribution boxes {is somewhat more risky and
more expensive, .but will be an operational necessity for some time,

   

 

 

 

          
 

  

 

 

 

 

   

 

    
 

 

     
 
   

  
 

P, ‘TECHNICAL

The change to making| which was the
original LIFEAT tap method, is the most obvious change on the operational
horizon, Technically there ts no difficulty to be overcome and in some
ways this system of tapping is a simpler method of doing the job, The
increase in security risk was noted in paragraph 2 E above,
