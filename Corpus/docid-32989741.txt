"No. Let me clarify one thing. When you talk about Alton, I would have been >
160 some odd miles north and east of it. And Quincy, I would have been approxi-
mately 150 miles almost more east than north of there. Quite a distance in between.
The only contact I would have had with them (the Agents in those areas) was when

1
we were all in the Springfield Office as we all worked on our own."

‘

EBERHART asked me if I recalled any investigation conducted by the Alton Resident
Agency concerning JAMES EARL RAY. I answered, "I wouldn't know what the others
were doing on the investigation unless I had a specific lead to handle myself.

I don't recall any, to tell you the truth."

EBERHART asked me if I had any knowledge of anyone in the Bureau having been jn
contact with JAMES EARL RAY before the assassination. I said, "I can't help you
there. I don't know of any investigation that was conducted by any of the other
parties involyed or any of them coming in ¢ontact with anyone connected therewith.

Just at a complete loss when it comes to that, I'm sorry."

EBERHART asked me if I came into contact with or had done any investigation

 

concerning the bank robbery of the Bank of Alton, Alton, Illinois, in July of
1967. I repeated, "The bank robbery of the Bank of Alton in July of 1967? No -
sir, I don't recall-anything about it. I don't even recall the robbery. It was

way south of me. 1 may have handled some leads on it, but I don't recall it."

Telephone conversation with MICHAEL EBERHART, Attorney for the House of Representatives

Select Committee on Assassinations, at 10 AM on Friday, September 1, 1978.

Mr. EBERHART stated they were interested in the escape of JAMES EARL RAY and the
investigation conducted by the Bureau under the UFAC statute in his escape from
the Missouri State Prison prior to the assassination of MARTIN LUTHER KING. He

Said that they have some records and some of the records had been destroyed. He

 

is trying to gather information and piece it together with what records they have

available. *

EBERHART asked me if I recalled having done any investigation concerning the Bureau's
UFAC investigaition. I answered, "Not really. Well, I tell you the only thing I

recall and I don't know whether it was at that time or the time of the assassination.
It seems to me some rumor or some information came to my attention that he (RAY).was or
had rejatives from the Quincy, Illinois area or some place in that area that would

be covered by the Resident Agency in Quincy."

EBERHART then asked if it could have been the Alton area rather than the Quincy

area. I answered, "The Alton area does not ring a bell] with me."

He said that BOB HAINES was in the Alton Resident Agency. I answered, "That's true."

 

EBERHART then stated that in handling investigation, he presumed that all information
came into the Springfield Office first, was that right? I answered, "All leads came
into the Springfield Office and would have been disseminated to the proper Resident

Agency which would have taken care of them."

EBERHART made the statement he had recently talked with BOB HAINES, formerly of
the Alton Resident Agency, Alton, I?linois, who recalled having done some work
concerning RAY's escape. He said, “Let me ask you a general question, which you
may have already answered. Do you recall any investigation pertaining to RAY pre-

assassination. or pro-assassination by the Alton Resident Agency." " 70. soe Wass
