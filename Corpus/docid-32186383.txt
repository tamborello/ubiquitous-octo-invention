something Constructive. This Gill recently,. ‘a few years
or-less ago Made a trip to the. Soviet ‘Union ete on ‘the
Youth Conference Know as the "World ‘Youth Conference.' ‘

He will probably emerge from the New York thing as‘a
full time organiser in some special” field such as. youth. re

; At the start of the: Meeting Genne brought out
A her brief case full of clipbiitigs (Newspaper) etc she .
also had a lot of penciled notes which she was —~
undoubtedly going to use to show what she was’ ‘doing ~
and to give others: hell for not ‘co-operating with her. Ow)

But the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around
the late Pres. Kennedy. (CCS)

aenold explained that since Oswald was. Considered a
Communist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode
against the C. party of America but by the time the
rec-actionaries were getting started it was announced
that it had been disclosed that it. seemed like the
extreme eight had been active. This was bore out
by the declaration of Russia that it was not the’

Cc. party that had done it because Kennedy was a

friend of the Working class but the work of the extreme
right or almost a fascist act. .This seemed to sober
the masses that it was the same caliber. of people who
had insulted Stevenson only Weeks before in Dallas,
Texas.

 

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about this
Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he
told them he gets lots of letters of enquiry about the
C. party and he probably answered it as he does hundreds
of others and even sent him literature if he requested
it. They (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on.the air with 4
statement but he stated to them he would have to dig the
letter out and:be sure before he Made any statement. =
Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson if when he got back. re
New York to look in the files if he had a letter fro

Wn Pokas, formerly from Bellaire, Ohic, and also an

asked Johnaon to compare the letter of Pokey's with:
Oswald's to see if they didn't have a lot: in ‘Common.
Palmer stated that he thought the statement by the —
Methodist Minister’ Covered’ the, Situation very good —
when he stated thatthe fact that: the Murder. of Bill
Moore, M’Edgar Evers and others in” the. south, going -
by without punishment had set the stage for the ©
Assassination of Pres, Kennedy. Everyone readily

agreed, CO

Arnold Johnson further stated that. no real Marxist
Could do: such a thing,. There is not Much doubt that
since the Soviet Union had expelled him by not
giving him a Citizenship in the Soviet Union because
they thought him to be an. Agent of Fascism, . Genne
Meanwhile was Chomping at the bit trying to get her
story told about the N,A.A.C.P. and cone. (4) (UW)

she finally got her Chance to unload b ] (W

She stated that about the time of the Civil Rights
March on Washington a few days before she had béen’
working with CORE and NAACP the reporter from the
Wheeling paper Intelligencer had Called and wanted
to talk about her. She gave him answers. on the
phone and finally hung upon him. from the time -
this phone conversation was completed She had been
quoted in the newspaper and exposed as a. Communist

_ party Member, which brought’ about her expelsion from
thé. N.A.A.C.P., but since has been restored to .
Membership, Then lately a Man. (Negro) by name: of Johnson ~
head of the local CORE group was indicted for robbing a
bus driver in Steubenville, Ohio. Genne had got: in
touch with. R. Gorby as she thought Johnson was being

' framed. Gorby found out and told her at this Meeting
that he had did the robbing and was Not being framed.
The best thing to do stated Gorby was to give him
help but do not put:CORE.and the NAACP out. om a limb

by doing it. ) iL
