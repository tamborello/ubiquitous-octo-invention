Mr. Mintz

The purpose of this memorandum is to furnish you ff. "yuc!——
information developed by a file review regarding allegations
of former Special Agent (SA) Arthur Murtagh in "The New York Times"
5/21/73.

 

 

 

 

 

 

’ My memorandum 5/23/73 indicated Murtagh alleged important
figures in the FBI tried to persuade community leaders in Atlanta
Georgia, they should not attend a banquet honoring King, with thej|
warning that the Bureau’ had information about King that might A
eventually embarrass’ those who attended, He alleged that an Agent
in Atlanta told him a top official from Washington called on two
religious leaders and the late Ralph McGill, editor of the "Atlanta
Constitution,"' to try to persuade them not to attend.

 

The attached copy of a memorandum from former Assistant
to the Director W. C. Sullivan to A, H. Belmont dated 1/21/65
indicates that Sullivan did talk at least twice with McGill and
discussed that subject and that McGill was to contact three

religious leaders. a REC: Bp: . 35Y9

"The New York Times'' article also indicated that
Eugene Patterson, former editor of the "Atlanta Constitution," |
produced a recollection that a Special Agent of the FBI attempted
in the Spring of 1964 to have Patterson expose King's.xunning~around
with women while posing as a moral leader. .

The attached memorandum W. C. Sullivan to A. H,. Belmont
dated 1/16/64 captioned "Communist Party, USA, Negro~Quastién; ~~"
Communist Influence in Racial Matters, IS - C,'' possibly pertains
to this recollection by Patterson. We have located no reference
that Patterson was subsequently utilized as the memorandum indicated
that he could be, : ,

This paper is an up-to-date revision of the one by the same title prepared

_ under the date of October 16, 1963, In updating it we emphasized three

Party, USA members, current and former Party sympathizers and his continued
reliance on the long-time communist[Stanley David Levison;] (2) facts
relating to the moral degeneracy of King; and (3) the recent and current
Party aims and activities: relative to the racial movement.

RECOMMENDATION:
Upon approval, consideration will be given to: appropriate dissemina-~

tion.* When approved, the paper should be returned to the Domestic
