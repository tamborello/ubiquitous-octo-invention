Source identified JOSEPH CONNO (phonetic) as a current
TEAMSTERS official in New York City. Source described CONNO as
one of HOFFA's close assistants in the 1960s who may have
knowledge of HOFFA's activities prior to the assassination of
PRESIDENT KENNEDY.

Based upon source's relationships with past LCN bosses,
source commented that if RAGANO's claims about an LCN contract
against PRESIDENT KENNEDY were true, RAGANO would have been
killed by the LCN years ago. Based on RAGANO's claims that HOFFA,
through RAGANO, requested TRAFFICANTE to arrange for the murder
of PRESIDENT KENNEDY, RAGANO should have been killed shortly
after PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S assassination. This would have been
done to prevent RAGANO from identifying either HOFFA or
TRAFFICANTE as orchestrating the "hit".

ollowing information was telephonically provided
byeNY [e56- ~oaft%s Special Agent WILLIAM M. MACKEY, Federal Bureau
of estiga€ion (FBI), Washington Metropolitan Field office n
1/16~17/92:

Source learned Tampa, Florida, attorney FRANK RAGANO
(phonetic) would be appearing on the ABC News show "PRIME TIME
LIVE" on 1/16/92 claiming to have information that former
TEAMSTERS President JIMMY HOFFA instructed La Cosa Nostra (LCN)
bosses to kill President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963. Based upon
source's past relationship with both HOFFA and RAGANO, source
categorized RAGANO's claims as "lies". .

Source advised source's relationship with HOFFA began
in the late 1950s while HOFFA was a Vice President of the
TEAMSTERS. Source's relationship with HOFFA lasted until HOFFA's
disappearance. Source described the relationship between source
and HOFFA as "close" (Roting that source was one of HOFFA's few
associates who could meet with or call HOFFA at any time without
an appointment. Source stated HOFFA offered source a position as
one of HOFFA'S trusted assistants which source respectfully
decl ined] (is )

In regard to RAGANO, (Source recalled attending only
three or four meetings with HOFFA d others in the early 1960s
which were also attended by RAGANG lthough source has not had
contact with RAGANO for many years, source recalled RAGANO (like
most people attempting to contact HOFFA) was required to make an
appointment to see HOFFA in the early 1960s. Source wag not aware
if RAGANO'S status with HOFFA changed in later years. &&)

Source identified attorneys close to HOFFA as EDDIE
SHAFITZ (phonetic), a partner of the late EDWARD BENNETT WILLIAMS
in Washington, D.C. and an attorney (name not recalled) who was a
close associate of the BUFFALINO LCN family. Sgurege did not
consider RAGANO an attorney "close" to HOFFA. Glu

Source advised HOFFA was very close to LCN boss SANTOS
TRAFFICANTE and other LCN members. Source said HOFFA was capable
of ordering a contract "hit". Source advised HOFFA was always
"doing favors" for high level LCN members and, if HOFFA requested
a contract "hit", the "hit" probably would have been done by the

LCN for free. (ot
