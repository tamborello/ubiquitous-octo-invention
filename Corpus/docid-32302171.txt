Cubans Poorly Impressed with Russians

 

MM T-2, a recently arrived Cuban refugee associated
With boat-building, the fishing industry, and Cuban life along
the northern coast of Ordente, Cuba; advised on September 2,
1964, that with the exeépticn of & small handful of péople,
the approximately 400 families who résidé in Puerto Manati,
Cuba, ~ opposed to the Communist régime of FIDEL CASTRO
and opposed tc the presence of Russians in Cuba.

   

MM T-2 stated that frequéntly when a group of"
fishermen gathered, one or moré Russians may be included
in the group, at which time they would invariably drink more
than the Cubans. If some of the Comminist Cubans presént
wanted to exténd themselves to be hospitable to the Russians,
they would sometimes offer the Rugsians Something to éat with”
their drinks. On oceasions this would bé’a can of Russian iiéeat.
The Russian sailors would invariably refusé this!-meat with an ~
emphatié “No" and say soniéthing which phonetically soundéd Like
"jau jau"/ If this was not cléai éfougti, the Rissigiis would
point to a dog in the street, thus indicating that the tinned
meat was dog meat.

: “ MM T-2 stated that he and other boat builders ana
fishermen once observed a KusSsian boat in Puér'to Manati ‘and
weré very unfavorably imoréssed by the Communist system)” ~
He stated that even the local Communists found it difficult
to defend” thé Russian’. He stated there was one long table
on the deck cf the Russian ship and the Giéw até. on the deck.
The Captain was the only person or the boat with a radio, and
the crew was not allowed in his qiiarters. When the crew went
ashore, they were accompanied by an armed guard.

MM T-2 stated he and some other Cuban boat

by one of the Russian’ supérlors who raised & heavy wrench”
Over-his hédd as though to strike him.” “This creatéd a very
anti-Russian atmosphere in that small coastal town.

~ ya T-2 furthér recalled that oné of the leading”
loéal Communists in Puerto Meriati identified himself to the
Russian ship Captain’ as & member of the local Cuban Communist
Party; he undoilibtédly expected to be invited aboard the boat ©
but instead was coldly rebuffed and told to keep away from the
ship.
