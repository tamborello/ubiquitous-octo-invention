MEMORANDUM FOR ROBERT M. BRYANT
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

SUBJECT: ch) ore Assassination Review Records: Release of
thformation from FBI Investgations of Foreign Officials
Establishments ~-

(S) At your request, the Department of State has reviewed FBI
documents (attached list) relating to investigations of diplomatic
officials and establishments.

(U) Solely from the standpoint of our bilateral relations the
Department of State has no objection to release of the redacted
information pertaining to Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Former
Republic of Yugoslavia, Cuba, China, Yemen, Romania, and Hungary.

(Ss) The Department continues to oppose release of any
material including the non-redacted portions, that would damage US
foreign relations by revealing FBI collection of information
involving Israeli diplomatic personnel, other Israeli officials,
and US citizens conducting routine contacts with Israelis. We
believe that the government of Israel would react quickly and
negatively to the release of such material.

(S) With respect to the Dominican Republic, the Department
agrees with the FBI determination that the redacted information
should not be released. There is a new government in the Dominican
Republic and acknowledgment that the US collected information as a
result of FBI investigation of foreign diplomats could cause that
new government substantial embarrassment and hinder ongoing
sensitive negotiations on a range of issues important to the United

States government. bod ‘a “HY- JOOG2 OF 7Ef 2.
