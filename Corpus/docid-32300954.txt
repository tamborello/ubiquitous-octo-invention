‘Phe Clique" and, therefore, is unable to have any knowledge
of terms used after a person becomes a member, T-1-stated
that T-1 knew that in order to be a member of "The Clique"
you did have to have a godfather to sponsor you but T-1

has no knowledge of any other requirements or rituals per-
taining to the initiation. T-1 added that those connected
with this group all grew up together in the same neighborhood,
attended school together, hung around together and so you
were always "on trial" and being watched in everything you
did or said.. .

(7-1 stated that T-l was close to NICK CIVELLA
and only had to report to him and this was based on the
fact that T-1l's father was a very close friend of "The
Men at the Bakery”.) T-1 stated that T-1 has never heard
any of the members ‘called "soldiers" nor has T-1 heard
the term of "caporegime" or the term "buttom men" used,

‘T-~1 stated that several years. ago T-1 was °
playing golf with NICK CIVELLA and a stranger joined in
the group.). T-1 stated that, this n wa ater identified 4)
to T-1 as "The Man" trom st. Louis, JOH TALE, (but T-2 “=
was not introduced to him.) T-1, further Stated that on-
several occasions T-1 saw/TO CCARDO of Chicago in the fib
company of NICK CIVELLA, (but~ in T-1 was not introduced ——~
to ACCARDO \and he, ACCARDO, was identified(to T-ljas
“Phe Man’ from Chicago. T-1 stated that several “months
after the Apalachin meeting/T~-1 was told that JOE FILARDO
and NICK CIVELLA had attended the Apalachin meeting.
T-1 said that "They only told you what they wanted you
to know and you never ask questions.

 

B ig

T-1 stated that T-ihas reviewed and heard."
on television the accounts of the testimony given by
JOE VALACHI and T-1 feels that, because CIVELLA and FILARDO
attended the Apalachin meeting there must be some connection
between "The Clique" and the Cosa Nostra as described by
VALACHI,. T-1 stated that T-1 has no evidence whatsoever
to prove that there is such 4 connection, nor was T-1 ever
given any information to indicate that members of both
organizations associtted with each other except for’ the
visits of VITALE and ACCARDO. T-1 added there is no doubt
in T-l's mind that if the members of the Kansas City group
were called upon for assistancé by members of the Cosa Nostra
such assistance and cooperation would be given. ‘
