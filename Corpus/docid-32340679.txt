DETROIT DIVISION

Re Detroit airtel to Bureau dated 3/3/67.

On 3/23/67 SF 2745-C-TE was contacted and the matter
set forth in Detroit airtel to Bureau dated 3/3/67, entitled
"LA COSA NOSTRA, DETROIT DIVISION", was discussed with ‘him.

aN

Informant advised that it has been many years since
he has been close to anyone in the Detroit Division, since he
came to California about 1940, However, he stated that from
conversations with his brother, JOHN MISURACA, and others, he
understands that JOE ZERILLI is currently the "big man" in
the Detroit area in the LCN. He advised that he has no knowledge i
of current membership in the Detroit area, but understands that
ZERILLI took over there sometime in the 1930s. :

Informant advised that at one time he heard the name
of the "big man" in Detroit, prior to ZERILLI's taking over, but
he could not remember it now, He advised the circumstances of
this knowledge on his part were that he was dating a girl, who . .
lived on a farm outside of Flint, Michigan, in approximately 1925 P|
and was planning to marry her through family arrangements; but !
that at this time arrangements were made for her to marry this
"big man". He advised at this time he could not recall the girl's
name, who was involved, but stated that at that time she was 18
years old and married the "big man" the following year, moving - :
to Grosse Point, Michigan, where they lived in a large mansion. |
He advised that subsequent to this, in the early 1930s, this man
(he was told) died of ulcers; but he had no further contact with
either the girl involved or the man. However, he understands that
she is still living in Grosse Point; has not remarried, and is
very wealthy.

Informant advised that, while he was not a member
during the time he was living in Detroit in the 1920s and
1930s, he was aware that the three CUSENZA brothers, PAUL,
JOE, and TONY, of Flint, Michigan, were members, as well
as a man named SAM RICCA, There men were all involved in
the killing of informant's brother, SAM; and TONY CUSENZA
allegedly was quite high up in the organization, and was
supposed to have been in charge of the group at the time
informant's brother was killed. Because of the mistake
made at the time of the killing, TONY CUSENZA was murdered
while eating dinner at his home approximately one year later.
PAUL CUSENZA, according to the informant, later died of
natural causes; and JOE CUSENZA moved to Modesto, California,
area and was subsequently killed in an automobile accident,
However, his son, LEO CUSENZA, is currently residing in the
Modesto area and is the Subject of a San Francisco AR invest-
igation.

Informant advised that JOHN MISURACA married JENNY
VENTIMIGLIA from Detroit, and it was his understanding that
her father and uncles were members of the organization; and,
during the 1920s and 1930s, were active in bootlegging, as
well as having a number of businesses. He advised he does _
not know where any of these VENTIMIGLIAs are still living,
but stated that, whenever JOHN MISURACA visited in the Michi-
gan area, he stayed with the VENTIMIGLIAs in Detroit.

; The name PETE CORRADO was not familiar to the in-
formant. With regards to WILLIAM "BLACK BILL" TOCCO, he
advised that he was not acquainted with this individual;
however, he did know a JOE "ONE EYE” TOCCO, who was an
accociate of JOHN MISURACA in Detroit and who, he believed,

. was subsequently convicted of a narcotics! violation and died

while serving time at Alcatraz. He advised that JOE TOCCO
was a close associate of JOHN MISURACA and JOHN would fre-
quently make trips from New Jersey to Detroit to visit TOCCO.

Informant advised that he did not feel under any
circumstances that anyone would inherit membership in the LCN,
but that, if a prominent member's son desired membership, it
would certainly be easy for him to obtain same and certain re-

' quirements might, possibly be waived; however, initiation would

still be necessary.

Informant advised, regarding the phrase, "He is
his father's son", that he could attach no special signifi-
cance to this statement, remarking it was a common expression
among the Italians. He said that, if there was any particular.
significance attached to the phrase concerning membership in
the LCN, it would probably depend entirely upon who was making
the statement. os

 

 

Informant advised that he would attempt to recall

the name of the "big man" in Detroit prior to ZERILLI, and .

the name of his wife, and would advise this office at a later , f
time concerning them, in the event they came to mind. It is t
noted that informant advised, regarding not being able to re-
call the girl's name, that he had actually only seen the girl
twice, and the family arrangement previously made, concerning
marriage, was called off when the arrangements were made for
her to marry the "big man”.

On 3/30/67, SF 2354-C-TE advised that informant
had no information concerning the identity or activities of
the Detroit LCN family.
