go out to thepublic now on this one picture, people will
pick that up and say, "Oh, they are only pursuing that idea
and that thought."

It would have to be handled very well.

. Mr.McKinney. Obviously if I were "the umbrella man"
and all of a sudden people were writing about me, I would
be the last person to come forward.

A president has been shot and who wants the FBI, Secret
Service and everybody else pouring over them because they
were sitting there with an umbrella.

This is the first time we have seen this man's face
and I think we should say many of the critics have mentioned
this umbrella man and we have found no vast importance to
it, but here is his face and would someone please come
forward and tell us if they know him?

The individual himself would be cracy to come forward.

Mr. Blakey. This is the first time there has been a
picture of him-from the front. In the past it has always
been a person from behind.

If the background was given to the newspaper people
and the statement was made, "This is only one among a number
of things being pursued by the committee and it is not of
central importance to us, but is a question raised by the

critics and it is a matter of some interest that he be

identified --"

Mr. Devine... Have we other photographs we-could have

identified at the same time to lessen the focus on this one?

Mrs. Burke. I suspect there are other photographs,

Mr. Stokes. When you release this photo and ask the
press to find out for you who he is, doesn't this lend
credence then to precisely what the press is saying? "See

there, I told you; they haven't found out anything."
I think you just invite that reaction from the press.
Mrs. Burke. Of course, we could indicate we have found
a photograph of the umbrella man, which nobody else has until
now. .

Mr. Devine. But we would want to talk to him as a

witness rather than as a suspect,
Mr. Fauntroy. It would be nice to clear that up one

way or the other.

Mr. McKinney. One thing the critics will say is that

they didn't follow up the umbrella man.

Mr. Dodd. They are going to be. saying things for the

next hundred years. If we go into this thing with that in

mind, we will be basket cases.

Mr. Fauntroy. The idea of a fellow having an umbrella

ona sunny day that is opened up ‘just as the President is

coming by ~-

Mrs. Burke. This photograph is after the shooting.

He is calmly sitting there on the curb.

it would require a committee resolution to make them public.

I might add it might also require the permission of Time-
Life, since they are their photographs.

Mr. Dodd. Mr. Chairman.

Mr.Stokes. Mr.Dodd.

Mr.Dodd. I have read that one "Thirty Seconds in
Dallas." In fact, they even have it that there is a gun in
there; that you open it up and it fires. I just wonder how
many theories there are. I know the signal theory and I know
about you opening it up and somehow there is a triggering
mechanism in the top of the thing. Those are basically the
two.

Mr. Blakey. Yes.

Mr. Dodd. The former having a lot more support, I
presume even among the critics, than the latter.

Mr.Blakey. He is one of the mystery figures. It is the
kind of thing people want explained. Why would a man have an
umbrella up on a sunny day?

Mr. Edgar. Do we have that picture with us?

Mr .Blakey. No, we don’t. It is part of the Zapruder
film. You can see right below where the President is. It
actually raises just before the assassination. These are
separate: pictures. You can see the umbrella laying right
here to the right of the light post. This is indeed an

umbrella man.

Let me raise with the committee a’ second question.
You have had passed’ to you copies of photographs. The source.
was from Time-Life. “uthey are enlarged. whe individual you
see sitting on the curb there is the so-called "umbrella
man," with a front view of him. It would be possible if
you knew him, I suppose, to identify him. These pictures

came into our possession in this form only a week or so

ago and the issue I present to you for your resolution is,

would it be advisable for the committee, with due dignity, to
release these to the press with an effort being made to
solicit anyone who could identify the individuals?

The umbrella man is in no sense a central figure in the
committee's investigation. He is a central figure in the
critical literature. The argument is made that he had an
umbrella on a sunny day and that the umbrella was raised
just before the assassination and was somehow a signal
relating to the assassination.

If it were possible to identify him and have him come
forward, it might be one way which that aspect of the
critical literature could be explained.

Our ability to identify him simply by showing this
photograph to people in Dallas is limited. If we release
it to the press, they could obviously give it nation-wide
circulation.

There are plusses and minuses if we did this. It might
appear to some credible people we are pursuing the umbrella
man theory, which lacks a certain credibility.

On the other hand, if these are printed and we indicate
we don't know who the person is, I suppose one of the first
things that will be raised is, "Why didn't ‘you give it to the
press earlier? We could have identified-him at any time."

I don’t know that there is an easy answer either way.

I also don't know that this is a terribly important issue,

but if we were to do it, it probably ought ‘to be done now and
