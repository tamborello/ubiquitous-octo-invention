LIFEAT coverage of two relatives of AMSTRUT-2 provides an “essential” check
on the. dciivities of AMSTRUT~-2, and particular informa:ion which aids the In-
tei cated case urficers yan che aciual coiacis with AMSTRUT-2 plus the progress
of the AMSTRUT operation, The value of LIFEAT providing an unilateral check
on the activities of AMSTRUT~-2 and her relatives during critical periods of the
AMSTRUT operatio: cannot be over emphasized. Copies of the daily take from
the wwo lines covered: by LIFEAT for the AMSTRUT operation are forwardad
iwice a week to WAVE,

LIFEAT inforntation is drawa on heavily both, for the: presen: hafassment campaign
. directed against ESLARD-1 as-well as for daily intelligence on the activities and
- contaéts of this target, Weekly summaries of LIFEAT provided material are
_-Gabled directly to Headqua rters and Station Guatemala City,

6) LIFEAT/AMERICAN COMMUNISTS

As per reference, coverage in this area was resumed on 22 January 1963 with the
return from home leave of the ODENVY processor of these lines, Travel and
contacts of the American Comnunist Group in Mexico (ACGM) provided by the~
LIFEAT take are of particular interes: to ODENVY.

) The installation of new municipal lighting for many areas in Mexico
City noted in referéace continued during January 1963, but at a reduced scale,
Some areas covered by LIFEAT basehouses are now free of the installation

li) Due to the circumstaices under which most of the LIFEAT basehouse

keepers were originaily recruited or shifted from other projects to emp!o;ment

in LIFEAT (in mos:icages at least ten years ago) they are either aware or have
reason to suspect that they are now, or at one time were, employed oy KUBARK
working out of the local ODACID installation, LIFEAT outside principal agent,
Devid M, WILSTED, (at Station direction) is making a major ard continuing effort
‘to orient the LIFEAT personnel toward the idea that there is 10 presen: contact
with the ODACID insiallation, that WELSTED and Ws m2 C, DRASAND (under alias)
are solely responsible for the operation and that they report directly to “Head-
quarters” in PBPRIME, Waen and if necessary for che Station Case Officer in
charge of LIFEAT to meet any of the local agents under LIFEAT, it is uader alias,
lf protracted meecings of this type become necessary a cover story will be devel-
oped for the Case Officer's continued presence in Mexico, ,.such as “tourist”

°.. G, PERSONNEL

-David M, WILSTED iéturned from ‘home leave o1 1 February 1963 and assumed full
Yesponsibiliies as LIFEAT outside Case Officer, Wayne C, DRABAND and
LIEMERACE-S who subszitured for WILSTED in the LIFEAT operational and techni-
cal phases respectively during WILSTED's absence are to be commended for their
matntaining LIFEAT at the high level of efficiency and security normally enjoyed

by the operation, DRABAND's performance was the subject of separate correspon-
deace (sce HMMT-3469),

 
       
   
     
 

As presently projected, Wayne C, DRABAND will be leaving Mexico on or about 1
November 1963, The responsible Station Case Officer and WILSTED are attempting
to resolve che problem of a replacement for DRABAND ar the local level, primarily
from the pool of agents already emploved under the project, This would have the
advantage of not further disseminating the fact that LIFEAT does exist, but would
have the serious drawback of giving knowledge of the whole operation (l.e, all
basehouses) to another Mexican national, (Note: At present LIFEUD-2 and
LIFEUD-3. the two who now co.ineci the tap lines to the basehouses, are
the only Mexican nat tonals who know of the location of all LIFEAT basehouses,

 
       
       
     
     
     
 

The Station does not desire another staff employee co fill this position, but would
prefer a 'J.S, citizen, technically competent, with some working knowledge of Span-
ish or ability to acquire a working knowledge of Spanish, Since working papers are
extremely difficult to obtain at present, for-cover purposes anyone coming into
‘Mexico to fill the LIFEAT position would probably have to come as a recired person
with a guaranteed income, ft is thought that perhaps an individual retiring from one
of che Armed Forces in a technical rating might have the best possibilities of filling
all che requirements noced,

 
   
         
     
   
    

Although the Station will continue to explore all possible solutions to the problem,
it is requested that Headquarters’ views and, if possible. assistance be givea the
Scation in chis matter, .

    
   
 

. 2, Oring the reporting period a number of memoranda were prepared by |
the Station for passing to local ODACID and ODENVY based in whole or in part on
LIFEAT provided material, The:folloving HMMs were provided as a by-product

of the LIFEAT Operation:
