I know, as I told you, that there was a SAVCHENKO... in the KGB
the MVD, that there was a SAVCHENKO, the nane SAVCHENKO, General ——
SAVCHENKO was chief Gf Intelligence and then SAVCHENXO, before this
SAVCHENKO, supposedly, was, well, a Minister in the Uuraine; that
this SAVCHENKO ((is)) Chairnan of the KGB in Moldavia.

That is all I know about SAVCIENKO.

Which SAVCHENKO: ¢

You made this cor:lusion yourself, or you knew ((this)) when you

were working.

((interrupts)) Well, when I was working, I knew; here I heard a

little bit, here a little bit of something.

From where (1G).

Because each person, Soviet, who works in intelligence, in counter-
intelligence, especially in recent times, he knows the difference
exactly and he knows both SAVCHENKOs from top to bottom (kak

obluplennyye).
I think not (Ya ne dumayu), because....

Both of them are Lieutenant generals, both are lieutenant generals,

both are connected with intelligence and counterintelligence.

So, the question is (stoit): either you were there and must know ~"

exactly, or you were not there and do not know.
I said what I know.
We will say this: that I am saying what I know....

Of course....

I certainly am not trying to contradict the facts, to tell-you -

something superfluous or to wipe out something unusual; I am saying

Wee

SEER

 

 
“The whole question lies in this.

In fact, facts.

And I am telling you that I did not know this....
((XG = A and B speak at the sane tine))
...ToO explain these facts articulately.

You may Gzozhete) know millions of ether things which I do not know,
But I know millions of things which you do not ‘now.

Well, what do you want from ne.

Tell ((me)), please, that a person -- if he had worked 11 years,

Knows GOGLIDZE, MASLENNIKOVY....

((interrupts)) I heard.

I do not know, I do not know, but I have heard the name.

--- Must know SAVCHENZO, Ivan Tikhonovich, also.

Working in the Second Chief Directorate, even if you did not write
any kind of reports (( letters” - pis'ma)) to him, probably some
kind of papers (bumagi) came from him every week.

I do not want to tell you....

(CInterrupts)) (({I did not see any)) papers over SAVCHENKO's

signature (za podpis'yu SAVCHENKO).

If you did not see ((such papers)), then again there is (stoit) a
big question: were you there at this time:

I am not trying to go into something deeply (zalazit’ kuda-to gluboko);
I simply am taking those persons and figues who are so outstanding
(xotoryye prosto s nog sshibatel'nyy) ((that)) one cannot be mis-

taken; a person who....

I heard the last name (faniliya), and ((that is)) all. |

If you have heard this last nane (faniliya}), then you must have

heacd the last nane (faniliya) of that one a hundred tines nore.

Maybe I did hear ((it)), but I do not know.
Ioan tellinz you that I do not know and that neitner one of (ni odin

iz) the SAVCHENKOs ever was my chief, ever.
He stood closer, closer ta the Second Chief Directorate than this one.

Not one of ny, of these SAYCHENXOs was ny chicf.
My chief was FEDOTOV, S'HUBNYAXOV, GRIDANOV; I an saying ((that))

these ((were)) the big chiefs.
I do not think that you are trying to understand me well.

I am trying to understand you well.
How is this -- I am not trying to understand you well,

It is in my interests (Eto v moikh interesatsh) .

i am trying to explain to you that if you, as an enployee who worked
((there)) for 11 years, know the SAVCHENKO who was in the Ukraine,
who was chief of Intelligence, who then found hinself with neither
business nor position, what happened to him, then you nate hin, i
((say)) that he ((is a)) Winister in Moldavia.

I am telling you -- and this ((is)) established by the facts, even

Soviet newspapers, including the names, etc. etc....

Of course.

Deputies are elected, there ((are)) Soviets (tam sovety)....

...Another person, but not this person.

Wy question: What do you know happened to the SAYCHENKO who was

with regard....

B. ((Cinterruots)) SAVCHENXO -- that is the last nane (familiya), and

that is what I said.

 

A. Tse question is (stoit) in tae following: that -- you see ~~ it is

years either tries to say that he does not know something or wants

to show that he knows.

B. ((Interrupts)) I am telling you what I know, as (kal) I know.

Why do you pose the question so.

A. I pose the question so, because there are two SAYCHENKOs, and
(Cit was)) not that SAVCHENKO of whom you speak that was in Moldavia,
but quite another, and I want to pin down (podvesti) here that you as

Directorate, Chairman of the KGB in Moldavia,

I think that this is that one who at one tine was in the Ukraine

(€the Uxrainian S5R)), a Winister,

Now we are talking about that one who was in the Ukraine and that one

who was chief of Intelligence, and so forth.

This one; he is in Noldavia, until recently (do poslednego vreneni)

in Moldavia.

I simply am asking, in a friendly way, ure you certain of this or not.
It is precisely this SAVCHENKO ((whom)) I have in mind.

I now am asking: Is there another SAVCHENKO there.

I do not know, I do not know. ote ee
Have you ever heard of another Lt Gen (General~leytenant) SAVCHERKO?
