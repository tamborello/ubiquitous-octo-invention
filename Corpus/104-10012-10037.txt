Union organization in Tulsa for 11 years and this form became
obsolete sometime during 1964, and it appears it had never
been sent, or if it had been sent it may have been phoned into
his office since it does not bear the Western Union stanip
number or time sent. Anderson further advised that these forms
may have at one time been given out for promotional purposes
and also given to large companies who had extensive dealings
with Western Union.

An official of Western Union at Minneapolis, Minnesota,
advised on April 12, 1973 that Western Union, Minneapolis
is the central nationwide repository for Western Union money
order records only. He further advised Western Union messages
are not filed in any central location, but are maintained at
the originating office for a period of 6 months to one year.

. On April 13, 1973, John Fedak, Assistant Controller,
advised the Sheraton Hotel was in existence in Dallas,

Texas during 1963. He furthe advised_registration cards for

the hotel are maintained for about 6[ years,. He stated there
would be no registration cards for the Sheraton Hotel in Dallas
going back to September, 1963, and there were no hotel records
that would establish who occupied room 567 on September 21, 1963.

A summary of residences, schools and employments for
subject maintained at FBI Headquarters and the Dallas Division
of the FBI, reflects information from Mrs. Ruth Paine, Irving,
Texas with whom Marina Oswald, wife of subject, was residing

“at the time of the assassination, who stated she drove Marina
Oswald to New Orleans, Louisiana on May 10 ~ 11, 1963 to be
with subject and she returned from New Orleans with Marina
Oswald on September 23, 1963. :

Information from above file reflects that Mrs. ;
Jesse James Garner, 4911 Magazine Street, New Orleans, Louisiana,
had substantiated that subject Lee Harvey Oswald resided at
4905 Magazine Street, New Orleans from May 9, 1963 through
September 23, 1963. It -is also reflected that subject filed
claims with the New_Orleans Division of Employment Security
on both September 17, 1963 and September 2, 1963, in person.

The above file indicates Lee Harvey Oswald was in

New Orleans on September 21, 1963, but. does not specifically.
establish he was in that city on September 21, 1963. iS

FBI Laboratory letter dated May 4, 1973, indicates
typewriting on above noted cablegram most closely resembles
a Remington pica style of type used on a Cadet portable machine
model 4 B. This style of type dates back to 1938. The age of
this document could not be determined. FBI Laboratory letter
dated May 8, 1973, noted no latent prints of value developed
on submitted specimens.

. On May 18, 1973, John M. Adams, Assistant Manager,
Washington ‘District “Office of Western ‘Union Telegram Company
(WUTC), 1405 G Street Northwest, Washington, D. C. advised that
while above document could conceivably serve as a rough draft
for a subsequent telegram and/or cablegram it, basically, is
a sheet from a Western Union International Communications
promotional type note pad, then (1963) readily available
at hotels, Western Union offices, etc. But, only up until about
October 23, 1963, when Western .Union. Telegram Company
was legally required to discontinue all cablegram operatins,
Western Union International, Inc., (WUI) came to be established
as a separate company. Mr. Adams noted originating offices

- are required to hold file copies only up to 7 months, or if charged,
thereafter until paid. .

; On May 21, 1973, Mr. Henry G. Catucci, Vice-President
for WUI Washington operations, 2100 M Street Northwest, Washing-
ton D. C. stated he was of the opinion such memo pads were
generally available and questioned item could have been tendered
as the text for an actual telegram and/or cablegram. He was

.of the opinion that the item in question, most likely, was
simply a personal message typed for some unapparent reason and
possibly passed along by some other means, rather than an
actual WUTC telegram or cablegram.

On June 5, 1973 a Special Agent for the FBI contacted
the following agencies regarding Dr. Fred L. Hutton, Jack
Nellville, Dr. Everett J. Hickok,and Dr. R. E. Bailey
with negative results:

- Pat Malloy, Records, Tulsa Police Department;
' Retta Cook, Records, Tulsa County Sheriff's Office;
Debra Williams, Records, Tulsa Credit Bureau. —
