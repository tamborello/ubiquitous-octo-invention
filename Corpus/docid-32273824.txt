Archivist of the United States

Dear Dr. Rhoads:

Arrangements have been previously made for
Committee staff members Dan Dwyer and James John-
ston to examine certain materials relating to the
assassination of President Kennedy which are located
at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Austin, Texas.

The purpose of this letter is to add the name
of Committee staff member Michael T. Epstein to the
list of individuals who need to examine these mater-
ials. Mr. Epstein and Mr. Dwyer plan to be in
Austin later this week, and Mr. Corcoran of the
Library staff has asked that we make sure that Mr.
Epstein's name is added to your list. Both he and
Mr. Dwyer have Top Secret/Compartmented security
clearances. I would appreciate it if you would com-
municate this information by telephone to Mr. Corcoran
so that there will be-no delay when Mr. Epstein and
Mr. Dwyer arrive.

Thank you for your assistance.
