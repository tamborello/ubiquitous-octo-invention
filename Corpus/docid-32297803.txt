' Re Bureau airtel 8/1/63, and my airtel 8/8/63.

On August 9, 1963, Assistant Commissioner Parsons
again contacted the writer to advise that the Comhissioner,
RCMP, had received a number of calls from the representatives
of the Canadian press on August 8, 1963, in which they
endeavored to obtain a statement from him on a story to the
effect that JOSEP; ALACHT had been spirited to Canada by the
FBI with the cooperation of the RCMP and was presently under
close guard in an isolated area in either the Province of
Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba.

Assistant Commissioner Parson said he merely wanted
to bring this matter to the attention of the writer and that
the Commissioner had responded to the inquiries to the effect
that they were "silly questions" and otherwise maintained a
"no comment" attitude, ;
