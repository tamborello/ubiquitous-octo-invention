SUBJECT:

   

  
 
 
 
   

This date I received a telephone call from a man.
who identified himself as John Craig and who gave his
.address as 1101 South Post Oak, Road, Suite .210,.. Le,
*;Houston,. Texas’ 77056; ‘telephotie number: 713+622+1791. |

He identified himself as a licensed private investigator
in Houston and a polygraph operator. He stated that he
wished to give information that may bear on the recent:

. Murder of John Roselli-in Miami, He advised that he -
was somehow. involved as a private investigator the states
he investigates frauds) with a Paul. Rossi, who he claims is
alse known-as Paul Calisi. Rossi is a Houston resident.
“and claims to'be a’ jeweler; however, he’ also owns four or ;
five Bars and restaurants on Bourbon Street in New Orleans,
one‘of which is named. The Blue Clarinet. Rossi is pending
charges in the Houston District Attorney's Office in an
attempt to, kill a witness. He is also pending. on another
“,,Charge of second degree felony.theft with four others... et
“who are, dccordirig to Craig, connected to organized crime
figures in Providence, Rhode Island. One of the others -
is (FNU) Ostigui. He related that. Paul Rossi is related
with, an attorney named Helmut Erwing, as against whom the
State Bar Association has disbarment proceedings pending

(he states that a Steve Peterson, of the General Counsel's
Office of the State Bar Association, is familiar with the
proceedings against Erwing). His number is 292-5409,

He claims that Erwing has some connection with the CIA

that evolved out of a Federal case that was instituted
against a man by the name of Phelbe in the early 1960's,

The story is that Phelbe worked for the State Department;
that while Erwing was a law student he was recruited by

the CIA, went to Germany to infiltrate the Phelbe family,

and that as a result of the information Erwing. obtained
charges were initiated agginst Phelbe and he was ousted

from the State Department.

Craig claims that Rossi, as a result of his troubles
with the law, became heavily indebted to the syndicate.
He indicated that Rossi in Houston works for Carlos
Marcello. He claimed further that Rossi, heavily indebted
to the syndicate, went to Florida together with Erwing,
as to whom there is a long-standing relationship, and
had conferences in Florida during a period of time that
Roselli disappeared. He related that he has sources of ,
‘information: closé to Rossi‘and closé:to Rossi's. “family; “ooo
and that recently Rossi became drunk and bragged that he {
had some connection with Roselli's murder. Upon inquiry,’
he said this occurred after the news stories of the find-
ing of Roselli's body. He, Craig, did not talk directly
to the source of information who was there when Rossi .

- referred. to the Roselli. murder. He claimed. that:.Paul |
‘Rossi's brother Robert was recently. involved in a gambling ©
conspiracy case in New Orleans, the outcome of which is
‘unknown. He-stated that he would be quite willing to
speak to an investigator and give. him whatever information
whe has available. :

 

   

Among other things, craig said ausing the course
y,.,0e£ our conversation that he had received death threats © ae
“which he attributed to Rossi. He sounded rational throughout
the conversation and obviously his status: and reputation .
can be checked, :
