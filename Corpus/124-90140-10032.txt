: Based upon his discussions at cIA, the Liaison Agent
received the impression that this matter is being very poorly .
handled by the Agency. It has an excellent. .opportunity to acquire ee
the services of an unusual source but certainly does not appear to ah- :
be giving this the proper type of atten n if the Agency
did not have an assignment arranged for eb at least could
be maintaining contact with him so that tude would continue
to be friendly and cooperative tS) ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
