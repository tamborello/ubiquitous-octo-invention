po stated that President Diem would not take such advice fram

' ‘Ambassador, and cited the example of the serious breach

: between Ambassador Durbrow and Président Diem which was

: occasioned by the former's blunt insistence on the need for

: goverment reforms. .Dr. Tayen “also ruled out any such recom-

: mendations by Generel Taylor as inappYopriate end. unacceptable .

, to President Diem. Dr.”Tuyen said that only the’ “Presidential ~

RELEASED FROM JAIL IN HUE RECENTLY, MANY REMAIN UNDER DETENTION
INCLUDING TWO’ LEADING BONZES WHO NEGOTIATED JOINT COMMUNIQUE

OF JUNE 16 AND RANKING LAY LEADER, SUCH ACTIONS TAKEN BY GVN

BUDDHIST PROBLEM-SOLVED RATHER THAN AS CONCESSIONS TO BUDDHISTS,..
ALSO, SOME INDICATION THAT GVN WILL NOT RPT NOT MOVE QUICKLY

TO REPEAL OR MODIFY DECREE LAW tos IN MEANTIME BUDDHIST FAITHFUL
STAYING AWAY FROM PAGODAS THROUGH FEAR OF GOVERNMENT REPRISALS...
iN SUM, GVN APPEARS BELIEVE ANY PREVIOUS CONCESSIONS. TO BUDDHIST

t : te 1

‘WITH REGARD TO REFURBISHING GVN IMAGE THROUGH BROADENING OF

GOVERNMENT, ETC; NO CONCRETE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN, RUMORS
PERSIST THAT OLEM WILL ANNOUNCE CABINET CHANGES AND REALIGNMENT
CERTAIN GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS, HOWEVER, SHOULD THIS OCCUR. IT
LIKELY TO BE MERE. WINDOW DRESSING SINCE MOST UNLIKELY. DIEM NOW
CONTEMPLATES ANY ACTION WHICH MIGHT UNDERMINE POWER POSITION

AND SOLIDARITY OF NGO FAMILY, WHILE WE CANNOT DISCOUNT POSSIBILITY
OF CABINET SHUFFLE FOR OPTICAL PURPOSES, WE SEE NO SIGNS THAT

ANY REDUCTION OF INFLUENCE OF THE NHUtS IS IN THE OFFING,

IN FACT, HARASSMENT OF AMERICANS BOTH THROUGH NEWSPAPER ATTACKS,
ARRESTS OF EMBASSY AND USOM LOCAL EMPLOYEES, AND GENERAL

FREEZE ON NORMAL CONTACTS BETWEEN AMERICANS AND THEIR VIETNAMESE
COUNTERPARTS WOULD INDICATE THAT FAMILY STILL BELIEVES IT

HAS STRONG CARDS TO PLAY, ,

AT THIS JUNCTURE LITTLE PROSPECT FOR PUBLIC AND OFFICIAL
STATEMENT BY DIEM BEFORE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SETTING NEW TONE FOR
GOVERNMENT, .DIEM?*S SPEECH ON OCTOBER 7 CHARACTERIZED BY AMBIGUOUS
POSITION TOWARD US, A CALL FOR SELF-SUFFICIENCY WITH XENOPHOBIC
OVERTONES, A CATALOGUE OF NATIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS , ‘AND AN .
EFFORT. TO "BLAME NEGATIVE. FACTORS ON COMMUNI STS AND * OTHER

MACH INATIONS FROM OUTSIDE. SVN.

6. US/GVN RELATIONS: NO RPT NO GENERAL IMPROVEMENT HAS BEEN
NOTED IN GVN CAMPAIGN OF DIVISIVE PRESS ATTACKS ON CIA, .USIS,
EMBASSY, ETC, RECENT TREND 1S TO ‘PLACE: BLAME ON ‘US GOVERNMENT
RATHER THAN SINGLING OUT SPECIFIC AGENCIES, .WHILE. CAMPAIGN
WAXES AND WANES, MAJOR THRUST IS STILL ONE OF CONFRONTATION
WITH US POLICY AS GVN WISHES TO INTERPRET IT,

GVN. APPEARS TO HAVE FOCUSED ON PARAGRAPH IN WHITE HOUSE

STATEMENT OF OCTOBER 3 ON SERIOUSNESS OF POLITICAL SITUATION

AS INDICATION US WILL CONTINUE APPLY PRESSURE FOR POLITICAL

CHANGES WHICH THEY NOT PREPARED GRANT, WE BELIEVE US PROGRAM

OF PRESSURES HAVE PUT DIEM/NHU OFFeBALANCE AND THEY ATTEMPTING

ASSESS STRENGTH OF US RESOLVE; HOWEVER TOO EARLY JUDGE ULTIMATE
