NOTE: Prior to. 1962 when he left the United States to live

in Africa and Europe, Sugar, who is currently vesiding in England,
had been active in pro-Castro groups and had a very. unsavory :
weputation, He had previdusly asked the Bureau, for the purpose
of obtaining money, to tecene an FBI informant and when turned
down, bo offered his eervices te CIA and they have since been
Operating him. There were rumors in radical cireles at the time he
left the United States that he was a. "Government Spy" but we

have received nothing recent concerning this and it would appear
connec is no JQ discussed in subversive circles in this 3

hk, Most of ali, we would welcome your comments on this general problem,
given your Agency's broad knowledge of such organizations as RAM in this
country. As a negro expatriate with pretended pro-Chicom sympathies, SUGAR
has also cultivated a reputation for sympathy toward the admittedly vague -
and divérse manifestations of "black nationalism", and toward such personalities
as Robert Williams who embody it. We would be most interested in receiving ~-
both your comments on this general movement.of opinion in the United States,
and your descriptions of the organizations associated with it which could
enable us to provide information and guidance to SUGAR for developing an |
association which would increase his operational access and effectiveness.

1. This memorandum requests your Agency's comments, on a priority basis,
relative to improving the operational capabilities of SUGAR, a source of this
Agency know to you, whose reporting on expatriate American leftist personalitie

: 2. Despite our hopes and his efforts, SUGAR was unable to obtein an
i invitation to the Tri-Continental Conference recently held in Havana, which was’
a target for collection by this Agency. It is our belief that. SUGAR's
: reputation of being pro-Chinese was responsible for his exclusion. In
\ . discussing this problem with important pro-Chinese communist personalities in
ot Europe recently, the latter suggested that his ability to secure access to
, ‘such meetings would be considerably enhanced if he could obtain a "crass-roots"
base: or connection in the United States which he could represent. In reporting»
this suggestion--which strikes us as valid--SUGAR speculated on the possibility:
that he might attempt to become the European "representative" of the
Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), an American organization of which he mows
little but which seems, from what he does know, to be consistent in its outlook d
with his ostensible political orientation.

   
   
   

3. In this comection, we would very much appreciate receiving any
information you possess on RAM, its structure, personalities and membership.
We would welcome particularly, any mailing list or address roster of this ~
organization which might be Passer C2 to SUGAR without compromiseto secuy
