on 6/12/61 SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III observed a 1960 Plymouth
Fury sedan, black bottom and white top, Florida license # 1we2076,
parked in the driveway of GABRIEL MANNARINO's cottage, RD #3,
near Léechburg, Pa. It is noted that the above license was
previously furnished incorrectly to Miami as 1902276.

on 6/12/61 #@ 615-C and PCI HERBERT LEE RAY advised SA FORSYTH:

 

Gambling in New Kensington, Pa., remains very slow, much to the
distress of the MANNARINOs and their underlings. Gamblers are
frequently heard to opine that after the General Elections in
November, 1961, the MANNARINOs will be able to "get to" the
new Mayor and things will open up again.

SAMUEL and GABRIEL MANNARINO, when in town, continue to eat lunch almod

   

 

 

daily at the Bonfire Restaurant, Leechburg Road, Allegheny Township, \
Westmoreland County, Pa., and they invariably bring visitors and Aga’
guests to this establishment. . ~
s
Miami will obtain holder of Florida license # 1W22076. AN
BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS. N
