December 18, 1963 that WILSON, aka, John Henry Wifison and
Juan Wilson Hgdson, was born in Livérpool on November 29,

     

In 1936 while. attending Liverpool University he
took part in some Communist Party (CP) activities, This

Spent 17 weeks in Russia in 19354§

During 1936-1938 he was in Spain on three occasions
and furnished a series of highly colored and exaggerated
accounts of his achievements with the Spanish Republican Air

was captured and made his escape, T-1 stated another indi-
vidual who knew WILSON in Spain advised that WILSON was
useless as an airman, was never a pilot and flew on one
occasion only as a gunner .(3)

spent three months in prison for passport fraud in connection
with his trip to Spain.—Later in 1938 he went to Buenos

caused embarrassment to the government and nearly led.to his
expulsion, “In,1954 WILSON attempted to act as an intermediary
in a copper deal with a Chilean firm, T-1 apprazes subject
as a psychopathic case, always eager to inflate th mpor tance
of his activities and to seek publicity for them. CB) ,

three months imprisonment in 1938 he was also fined _L5 on
