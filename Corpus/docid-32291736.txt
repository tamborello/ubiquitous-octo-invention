This source also reported that IRVING
PEARLMAN, a dealer in dice games, arrived in Miami
from Las Vegas, Nevada, stayed less than a week, and
then went to Freeport, where he reportedly will be
a dice dealer and one of the few American employees.

PCI, advised DINO CELLINI
(MM 166-1) will be one of the supervisors in this
casino. CELLINI,-he learned, operated the school in
London, England, where gambling instructions were issued
to prospective employees. He also reported that the
Bahamian law does not permit coin operated machines,
where more than two coins are returned and as a
result no slot machines will be located in the gambling
casino.

. MM 509-C-TE reported that RUTH GASSENHEIMER,
co-owner of the Patio Bridge Club, Miami Beach, is
generally disliked by the bookmakers and gamblers,
put due to the fact that there are very few hangouts
available for the card sharks, bookmakers, gamblers, etc.,
to hang out, her place has been overflowing at night.

As a result of the increased activity and because there

are generally 25 to 35 persons who watch a card game

and bet anywhere from $10.00 to $200.00 a game, among
themselves, she has started to charge all those who bet

on card games a fee of $1.50 per game, which is the regular
card fee for those who play in the game.
