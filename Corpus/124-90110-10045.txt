Attempt on Life of Joseph\Merola

Obstruction of Justice ss
In early 1962, Joseph Merola, FBL Number 4 989.299,
testified for the United States government at a trial in United
States District Court in Chicago,,ILLinois.- Sam Mannarino,
FBI Number 11 584 D, was one of the defendants inthis case.
Since this trial there have periodically been rumors that some
harm might befall Merola as Sam Mannarino and his brother,
Gabriel Mannarino, FBL Number 854 850, are regarded as vicious
hoodlums who operate out of the Pittsburgh-New Kensington,
Pennsylvania area. ‘Merola lives on Miami Beach, Florida, at the
present time. .

On December 4, 1962, Sol Vizzini, Investigator for
the U. S$. Bureau of Narcotics, Miami, Florida, stated on
November 13, 1962, he contacted a confidential informant of
his who has provided both reliable and unreliable information
in the past. This informant told Vizzini he heard a rumor that
there was a killer in town accompanied by an apprentice, and
these two men had been sent down to do some work by two brothers
from New Kensington, Pennsylvania. Vizzini's source stated the
two men were staying in Room 823 at the Eden Roc Hotel, Miami
Beach, Florida. Vizzini stated his informant claimed the killer
was a white male, about 57 years of age, Jewish descent, 5'9-9%",
brown hair, greying at the temples. The informant described
the apprentice killer as white male, age 2/7, Jewish descent,’
and taller than the other man.

On December 4, 1962, William Kenney, Department of
Justice Attorney presently assigned to Miami, advised he had
previously been in contact with Vizzini in this matter. He
added a confidential informant of his about the same time had
told him there was 4 killer in the Miami area named Charlie

Weiss. Mr. Kenney related a man named Charlie Weiss was

mentioned in connection with McClellan Committee hearings.

‘Re: Unknown Subjects (2); Alleged

 

Attempt on Life of Joseph Merola

On December 13, 1962, Mr. Kenney made available
a photograph of Charles Socrates Weiss referred to in the

" Me@lellan Committee hearings. This individual is New
_ York Police Department Number 57106 and was arrested by

them on September’ 27, 1932. No additional descriptive
data is available on Weiss.

On December 7, 1962, Ronnie Lynch, Detective for
the Dade County Department of Public Safety, Miami, Florida,
advised he determined that on October 28, 1962, one Bernard
Mitchell of Chicago checked into Room 823 at the Eden Roc
Hotel on Miami Beach. On November 1, 1962, Mitchell was
joined by one Samuel Stern. Stern checked out November 8,
1962, Phillip Litner joined Mitchell in Room 823 on November
8, 1962, and checked out November 10, 1962. On November 15,
1962, a woman who identified herself as Mitchell's wife joined
him in Room 823 and as of November 22, 1962, was still occupy-
ing that room with him, Lynch stated on November 22, 1962,
he discontinued his inquiry when the descriptive data on
Mitchell and his associates didnot coincide with that given
by Vizzini's informant.

Vizzini, Lynch, and Kenney speculated that if
killers had been engaged by two brothers in New Kensington,
Pennsylvania, and sent to Miami Beach, the brothers might
be the Mannarino brothers and the victim might be Merola.
On December 4, 1962, Mr. Kenney advised he has periodic
contact with Merola, he has advised Merola of the rumors,
Merola does not seem to be upset or concerned, and Merola
was out of town on December 4, 1962.
