'2. Inside Cuba: a large number of intelligence agents, mostly
unwitting of U.S. connections. Small number witting. The two
\ action teams in place currently only collecting intelligence, not
actions (sabotage, etc.). Several small caches of arms, ammunition,
medicines - no large ones (to support large guerrilla action).

3. CIA in touch with many Cuban exile groups and individuals
in U.S., Latin America, elsewhere - mostly to keep tabs on potential
resources or collect information. Offered to help steer about 250
men into U.S. military program, many of whom believed be out of
condition.

4. We have listed over 200 Cuban anti-Castro organizations,
mostly in U.S., but some in Puerto Rico, Latin America, and inside
Cuba itself. 23 are major groups, 22 of which headquartered in
Miami, 1 in Puerto Rico. Others mostly quite small. Many splinter
factions. Some are militant, such as Alpha 66 and the Cuban Libera -
tion Army (Colonels Barquin and Martin), and remain outside U.S.
control. It is possible they have groups of Cubans in secret training
in U.S. and unreported to U.S. agencies.

5. U.S. Army program. Openly military service, but Cuban
Brigade" been noised about. 730 Cubans at Fort Knoxtoday. 125
en route today to Fort Knox. 1,580 Cubans in Miami have been
referred to U.S. Army recruiting station.

Future

1. Castro is currently vulnerable, and might remain so until
Soviet equipment is crated and is seen departing Cuba by the people.
Vulnerability could lead to coup by old guard Communists, young
palace pro-Soviets, or 26 July leaders still in official positions.

It might be bloodless, to satisfy both U.S. and USSR with a new look,
but have Soviet ties. U.S. could undertake covert actions to generate
ctions against Castro, but time is running out.

2. Cuban people reportedly feel let down by U.S. Doubtful if
U.S.-agencies could sponsor a Cuban revolt, covertly. Cubans
would foresee another Hungary.

3. Majority of Caribbean countries reportedly feel let down
by U.S. negotiation with USSR and by-pass of Castro/Communist
problem in Cuba. Unless U.S. acts firmly on latter problem (to
prevent subversion, insurgency by Castro/Communists in Hemisphere
from Cuban base), it will be extremely difficult for U.S. agencies
obtain Latin American help to mount covert operations against Cuba
in future.

4. Possibly an independent Cuban group, such as Manolo Ray's
in Puerto Rico/Miami, could attempt an overthrow of Castro.
Possibility being examined by Morales of State (Deputy to Ed Martin).

OUTLINE OF COVERT OPERATIONS

At present

1. All militant operations (sabotage, etc.) under U.S. control
are being held at a stop. Volatile Cuban personnel in operations
feel highly frustrated. Some 75 in safehouses and training sites,

“U.S. Two action teams inside Cuba, one small, other has about
200 followers. Resentment over U.S. closure of solving Cuban
problem could lead to acts to embarrass U.S.

2. All U.S. covert psychological assets turned over to USIA
control for contingency period. Assets include Radio Americas
(Sware Island). : ;

3. Intelligence collection under U.S. control, including by
resources inside Cuba, continues. Note sensitivity of assets of ( la
friendly Services other nations (eritiab) in helping U.S. : @ «)

4. Alpha 66, a Cuban group quite independent of U.S. control,
reportedly had planned an attack against a missile site on 30 October -
by organization members inside Cuba. No further report.

5. On 28 October, CINCLANT was told (by JCS message) to
be on lookout for Alpha 66 and prevent any operations against Cuba
at this time. CINCLANT ordered his forces to look out for such
units (in high-speed craft) and prevent operations against Cuba.
Orders remain in effect. Ten men en route picked up today by .
Coast Guard.

Resources

1. CIA has about 75 Cubans in U.S. capable of militant
(sabotage, etc.) operations. Mostly separate groups, 2-5 men,
in safehouse areas. Largest group is 20 men.
