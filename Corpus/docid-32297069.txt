\ ;
the Tournament of Champions (Golf Tournament) is being held
at the Desert Inn Country Club from 4/29 through 5/4/65 and
this may account for ROSELLI's trip to Las Vegas at this time.

on 4/29/65 GEORGE HOPKINS, supra, advised that the
apartment was holding mail for ROSELLI and two pieces of mail
bore the return addresses, respectively, of "PLO. Box 472,
Place d'Armes; Montreal, Canada," and "Jubilee Iron Corporation,
630 Dorchester Blvd., W.,Montreal, Canada.” :

a

Mr. HOPKINS further advised that ROSELLI is frequently
called by Mr. and/or Mrs. CROSBY. It is recalled a couple of i
weeks ago ROSELLI was observed having dinner with LINDSEY |
CROSBY and two women.

on 4/27/65 CHARLES BUONORA, 1442 Westwood Boulevard,
West Los Angeles, who operates Buonora Art School at this
address, advised that KATHLEEN ROSSELI, 1333 South Beverly ;
‘ Glen Boulevard, West Los Angeles, telephone 474-4526, was
a student at his school in November, 1964. She paid $10
for one month and attended classes about twice during. November.
BUONORA said that KATHLEEN did not refer to herself as Mrs.
ROSSELI or furnish any information about ROSELLI, except to
state that they travel a lot to Las Vegas, San Francisco (and
‘elsewhere) and she would probably have to miss some classes.
| : BUONORA advised that he knows of JOHN ROSSELLI through reading
ie the book "Green Felt Jungle" and he assumed that KATHLEEN's
. husband or boy friend .was JOHN ROSSELLI. KATHLEEN listed her
hobbies as golfing and water skiing and started classes to
learn.to paint and draw. BUONORA said she was an intelligent,
attractive girl. After she quit attending classes, he called
her residence once or twice and could not reach her and has
not seen her since some time in November, 1964.

 

 

LV 10-C furnished information on 4/26/65 that RUBY
KOLOD made reservations for a Mr. and Mrs. FLETCHER JONES
at the Desert Inn Hotel at the request of JOHN ROSELLI.
JONES indicated that he would stay for seven nights. Mr.
and Mrs. JONES are listed as "top priority" by the hotel and
4+ was indicated they were in Las Vegas for the Tournament of
Champions. It is probable that JONES is the automobile dealer
from Los Angeles. Information was recently received by the
