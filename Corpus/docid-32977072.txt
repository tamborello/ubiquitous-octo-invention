MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Support of Comandos L

You will recall that the attached proposal dealing with Comandos L,
has been discussed several times by the Special Group. It was first
“tabled on the 15th of August and deferred because the paper had just
been distributed. It came up again on the 29th of August and you put
“it over to allow Mr. McCone to give his personal views. It then was
thoroughly discussed on the Sth of September. An excerpt from the
minutes of that meeting is attached. You then proposed to discuss it
with the Group on the 19th of September; in your absence I raised it
but got no reaction.

I fully realize that other considerations, particularly vis-a-vis
Gromyko, changed the atmosphere somewhat, after the meeting of the 5th
of September. A brand new development has now arisen, however, which
makes it desirable. to get a decision on this. |F

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The new development is that the FBI has passed to the British a
fairly detailed and accurate report on the organization and planning
of Comandos L. Among other things, it mentions the plan to stage through
an island in the Bahamas, probably Andros, The FBI, in proper cousinly
fashion, passes reports of this kind to the British from time to time,
when they involve British territory. The point is of course that if we
are going to cooperate with Comandog L, then we would want to get the FBI
baw stop passage of such reports.

   

The operators feel that they could undoubtedly pick up useful contact
again, and they still believe in the project. State is still dubious.
Ed Martin said the other day, in Johnson's absence, that Johnson's under-
standing was that if you got a favorable reaction from HA, you would then
put this back to the Department and allow them to open up discussions all
over again. This was by no means my understanding of what you proposed
to do (although of course this was before any change in general climate).
I am sure I accurately reflected what you said at the September Sth meeting,
and I think suggested your general attitude, which did not seem to be as

Martin describes it.
