Seventh Street, Steubenville, Ohio

 

Petition for Naturalization Number 2418, filed
November 26, 1940, was denied by~Immigration Officials on
_ the grounds that the Petitioner - TRIPODI, had failed to
establish good moral character during the period required by
law. .

On August 29, 1940, -TRIPODI registered as an alien
in accordance with the Alien’ Registration Act, and stated he
had been arrested four times, On March 2, 1944, he executed
Form AR-2-A (Alien Régistration) and admitted having been ~-
arrested seven times, This matter had previously been pre-
sented to the United States Attorney, who informed INS that no
prosecution would be instituted, On July 10, 1942, a question
and answer statement was taken from one FRANCESCO PETROLO ‘in
connection with a violation of the Immigration Laws,
Mr, PETROLO stated that he owned the Star Cigar Store at 136 North
Sixth Street, Steubenville, Ohio, and that in the rear of this
store a gambling business was operated by JAMES TRIPODI..
During an investigation conducted in connection wit h one. BRUNO
TEGANO, information-was obtained that said BRUNO TEGANO was
employed as a "pick-up" man for one "JIM," who operated a
lottery at the Star Cigar Store, North Sixth Street, Steubenville,
Ohio, The persons who gave the information subsequently ad-
mitted to INS officials that the "JIM" to whom they had re-
ferred was "JIMMY TRIPODI."

 

SER Law-difal

 

In view of the fact that instant Petition was filed
on November 26, 1940, it was necessary for the Petitioner to
show that he had been a person of good moral character for a
period of five years immediately preceding the filing of the
Petition until the date of his admission, The evidence mentioned
