the MIR with acts of violence. The pro-Soviet PCP
faction may yet decide to seek the best of both
worlds by giving partial support to the insurrec-
tional movements while continuing its current ac-
tivities in the political sphere.

20. It is believed that as of April, the Cuban
Government had cut off financial support to leftist
Peronist groups in Argentina and promised to channel
its support through the official Communist Party of
Argentina, :

21. Venezuela and Colombia--two of Havana's
most emphasized targets in the hemisphere--fall into
separate categories. Cuba has always strongly sup-
ported the Venezuelan Armed Forces of National Libera-
tion (FALN), over which the Venezuelan Communist Party
(PCV) exercises a dominant influence, The PCV, beset
by internal problems, is making attempts to justify
more emphasis on political action, although not giving
up the support of paramilitary activities. The extent
of Cuba's current material support of the FALN is un-
known but the propaganda support is continui
high level. Cuba maintains an official office for a
ALN representative in Havana and approved having a
FALN delegation at the Cairo preparatory meeting for
the Tri-Continent Conference.

22, In Colombia, it is even difficult to speak
of an official Communist. party; on 30 May the party
split into two factions, each professing to be
"authoritative."' The original Colombian Communist
Party (PCC), by far the larger, has been generally
content to follow a pacifist, political role, with
the exception of the defense of the so-called "en-
claves" of Marquetalia and Riochiquita. The rival
faction, the Colombian Communist Party--Marxist
Leninist (PCC-ML) is more violence oriented but there
is no evidence of its having received any support
from Cuba. Before the Havana Conference, Cuba sup-
ported an independent insurgent force, the Army of
National Liberation (ELN), with money and training.
However, this aid appears to have been terminated.
The ELN, in fact, may. soon disband as an entity; its
remnants may be absorbed by the PCC-ML. :

Outlook

24, The shift in emphasis in Cuban propaganda
and Havana's assumption of the responsibilities and
drawbacks inherent in the decisions of the Havana
Conference reflect Cuba's increasing awareness of the
realities in Latin America. In 1959, Castro was con-
vinced that his revolution would spark similar revolu-
tionary movements in the rest of Latin America. He
backed up this conviction by blatant incitements to
immediate revolution and by aiding small-scale in-
vasions of Panama, the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
However, the luster of Castro's revolution has been
dimmed by Cuba's performance in the domestic field
and the failure of its hemispheric goals. In the last
two years, Castro's hopes have been rebuffed in
Venezuela, British Guiana, Brazil, and the Dominican
Republic, as well as in the failure of any of the
continent's militant subversive groups to overturn a
government. These have all served to convince Castro
that his "inevitable" revolution is not imminent. [In
addition, Castro now seems confident that his own
regime can continue to exist without like regimes
elsewhere in the hemisphere.

25, Thus, while Castro is still willing and
able to aid subversive movements, he has shifted em-
phasis. He now is concentrating on those countries

than the Yon Sosa group, be accepted as the official

opens in Havana on 3 January. Thus the FAR is ap-
parentty, Havana's choice for Guatemafan representa—

tion at ‘the Conference. Representatives of the Com-
munist and radical states of Asia and Africa, as well
as delegates from revolutionary movements in these
two areas and Latin America will be brought together
at the conference to discuss problems of imperialism
and colonialism, and ways to coordinate their revolu-
tionary movements. An observer at the Cairo meeting
commented that only the Guatemalan representative
seemed to be really in "Castro's pocket."

19. In Peru, Cuba is continuing its propaganda
su £t the Revolutionar e

. (MIR). ‘In the past; the MIR received considerable

material assistance from the Cubans--although this

is no longer so. Its leader, Luis de la Puente Uceda,
has visited Cuba several times and is reportedly on
good terms with Castro. In an interview printed by

a Lima newspaper on 3 May, de la Puente was quoted

as saying, "I have chosen the path of action. Our
people's only way to liberation is armed rebellion..."
This statement was followed up in June, when the MIR
began its long-delayed guerrilla operations with at-
tacks near Huancayo in Peru's central zone. The
action has been applauded in Cuban propaganda media.
On 27 September, the Union of Peruvians in Cuba (one
of several such national groups parroting the Cuban
line) issued a manifesto stating, “under the condi-
tions prevailing in Peru, there is no other way to
eliminate all the ills that afflict our people than
the path blazed by the MIR guerrillas. -we...pro-
claim our wholehearted support to the guerrillas. "
Formal Cuban support for this position was contained
in a July article in the Cuban daily Hoy which de-
clared, "The Peruvian masses have learned where the
only solution to their ills rests, and for that reason
they are looking today toward the mountains, the
jungles, and the guerrillas." Since August, the pro-
Soviet and pro-Chinese wings of the PCP have taken
increased cognizance of the guerrillas and condemned
the government's counterinsurgency activities. They
have not openly endorsed the MIR, however. At pres-
ent, it seems unlikely that either faction will support

hat Castro has indeed had a change of heart in

regard to the official Communist parties. Castro
is quoted as saying that "the present Communist
parties are the best things that each Latin Ameri-
can nation has" and his attitude is represented as
demonstrating that Castro's confidence in the Latin
American parties has increased substantially.

 

 

 

 

16. Along with agreeing to channel support
through the orthodox parties, the representatives
at the Havana Conference also specified the countries
in which they believe that an “exploitable revolu-

mala, Colombia, Paraguay, Haiti, Honduras, and

Panama. All of these countries, and especially the
first three, are constantly mentioned by Cuban
spokesmen as the leading revolutionary targets in
Latin America. Jul r is
ist of areas of primary Cuban interest.

 

 

17. Evidence is still inconclusive as to the
extent to which the agreements reached in Havana
are being implemented. The results of the con-
ference seem to be most apparent in Guatemala.

since early eopile'’s gressive Party (PPP)
- of British Guiana--the party of ousted premier and
Castro-supporter Cheddi Jagan--has emphasized the
reorganization and expansion of its long-term po-
litical education program. On 1 September, Jagan's
wife reportedly told an organizer of the PPP that
she was making arrangements for.a nine-month "political
science" course to be held in Cuba. Two PPP "scholar-
ship students" who returned to British Guiana in
September informed police that the obligatory military
training they had received in Cuba had included making
four types of bombs, including Molotov cocktails.

 

11. Although Jamaica is not one of Cuba's
priority targets in the hemisphere, a report of June
1965 indicates that Cuba intends to train about 200
Jamaicans during the next few years. These Jamaicans
are then to become leaders and instructors for the
pro-Castro elements in Jamaica, The Cuban: Consul in
Jamaica, although not directly involved in the arrange-
ments, reportedly has given assurances that the group .
would receive guerrilla warfare training if it could
get to Cuba. .

*An additional 25 Guianese are scheduled to leave

12. Although sufficient documentation is not
available, it is believed that Cuba continues to
train unspecified numbers of representatives from
other Latin American revolutionary groups. It

should be noted, however, that very few Colombians
and no known Patuvians are recelving guerrilla war-
are training in Cuba at the present time, despite.
the fact that these two countries are at the top of

Cuba's subversion list.

13. Cuba's only known large shipment of weap-
‘ons to a Latin American subversive group was a three-
ton cache seized by Venezuelan authorities in Novem-
. ber 1963. This experience apparently convinced
Castro that weapons procurement is a problem to be
solved by the internal subversive forces, not by
Cuba. In a speech on 28 May, Castro said, "In
reality, the people's weapons are in the hands of
- their enemies. ...When we learned to take weapons
from the enemy, we had learned to wage the revolution."
This appears to confirm the statement of a defector
from the DGI that because of the exposure of arms
Shipments to Venezuela it is now Cuban policy to re-

ject all Latin American requests for assistance other
than for funds and Somé training.
The Havana Conference and Afterwards

14. The most significant recent change in
Cuba's support of subversion in the hemisphere oc-
curred at the Havana Conference of Latin American
Communist Parties held in November 1964, At that
time, Cuba and the Latin American representatives
agreed to limit their support to those revolutionary
movements officially endorsed by the pro-Moscow
Communist Party.of the respective country.. The
attending parties pledged themselves to increase
their support of such groups and to attempt to unify
revolutionary movements in the hemisphere.

15, Implementation of this policy involves a
sharp departure from past Cuban practice. Formerly,
Cuba devoted much of its support to revolutionary
groups which were competitors of the regular Commu-
nist parties. Cuba's adoption of the new policy may
partially be the result of its disillusionment over
the failure of these organizations, its recognition

Cuban Subversion in Latin America

1. Cuban spokesmen continue to reiterate their
determination to aid subversive movements in Latin
America. A variety of sources confirm that some aid

is being provided, although the level of such_material
assistance seems to be less than a ago.

2. Eowever, Cuba's activities in support of revolu-
tion in Latin America seem to be undergoing a change.
Ernesto "Che" Guevara's fall from power is sympto-
matic of this shift, Guevara was Cuba's most doc-
trinaire spokesman for militant revolutionary tactics.
Moreover, at the Havana Conference of 1964, Cuba
agreed to funnel its aid only to those subversive
movements endorsed by the pro-Moscow Latin American
Communist parties. It is still too early to judge
the extent to which this commitment is being imple-

mented. For the present, Cuba seems to be following
a cautious policy of providing support——largety—in
the form 0 ropaganda---n those countries where
Havana judges indigenous revolutionary movements to

His country's "international duty."

Propaganda Support

4, Propaganda has bee
heavilv used by the Castro regime in its attempts

to overturn established governments in Latin Amer-
ica. Quban broadcasts to Latin America total more
than 160 hours a week i i French

Creole, and the Indian languages of Quechua, Guarani,
and Aymara, In the early days of the Castro regime,
such broadcasts were primarily devoted to strident
calls to immediate armed action. Now the emphasi
is more on laying the groundwork for future revolu-
‘tionary action a on attempts to unite feuding rev-

- Olutionary organizations The majority of these

; proadcasts masquerade as objective commentary on

political, economic, and sociological conditions in
the various countries of Latin America; they replay
statements by revolutionary groups, and feature
documentaries designed to show that only the "Cuban
way" will solve the problems of Latin America,

5. During the month of Jul for example, one
third of Havana radio's total international radio
service commentaries were devoted to specific Latin

American countries. Venezuela received the greatest
attention, primarily through the reguiar three-times-

a-week program "Venezuelan Realities."

 

6, Broadcasts to Haiti are an exception to the
general rule. In these, Havana directly incites the
Haitians to launch immediate revolutionary action.
Haitian Communists long-resident in Cuba broadcast
vitriolic commentary on the economic and political
deterioration of Haiti and the need for unity among
the revolutionary forces. Commenting on the lack of
concrete action by Haiti's two Communist parties, a
recent broadcast stated, "it is of. the utmost neces-
sity that all honest Haitians gather under the banner
of the Unified Democratic Front...to make Duvalier

«pay for. his treason and all of his crimes." On the
practical side of revolution, Havana radio has been

and broadcasting speeches that were given in Cuba
by the representative of the militant Venezuelan
Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN).

7. Havana radio broadcasts have had some de-
gree of success, according to both their supporters
- and their opponents. During the Dominican revolt,
several clandestine sources reported that the rebels
listened regularly to Radio Havana and were impressed
by the speed with which the Cuban network reported on
local developments. In Haiti, President Duvalier is
making strenuous efforts to outlaw the Cuban lottery;
Haitians listen to Radio Havana for the lottery re-
sults and absorb a good dose of anti-Duvalier propa-
ganda at the same time. Peruvian President Belaunde
has attacked the provocative reporting_of the Cuban

Training

8. It is on training of Latin American sub-
versives and limited financial support of their move-
ments that Cuba rests much of its hope for revolution~-
ary success, The experience of the Dominican Republic
--where a small group of Cuban-trained extremists was
able to lead the rebels in the worst of the fighting--
has probably convinced Havana of the merit of continu-
ing to train subversives from a variety of countries
so as to be ready for targets of opportunity. Cuba's
organ for intelligence and subversion, the General
Directorate of Intelligence (DGI), maintains installa-
tions for training Latin American subversives in the
specifics of revolutionary warfare and providing them
with ideological orientation. Two weeks ago the DGI's
director, Manuel Pineiro, was named to the Cuban Com-
munist Party's Central Committee and to its select
three-man foreign affairs committee, an act which af-
firms the priority Cuba places on the activities of
his organization.
