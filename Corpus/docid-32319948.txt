e) re[ iS Appeal Unless Reassessment
i : Following Ten Year Postponement Is Allowed - A ten year extended
postponement is insufficient if it mandates automatic disclosure
at the end of that period and would preclude the FBI from
contacting the PCI to re-assess the risks of disclosure.

 

OTHER 4

f) PCIs Vincent Locicero and Wade Hansen -—
Appeal - There is no information regarding the existence of
surviving family members of these individuals - one of whom was a
symboled source, and the other of whom provided information on a
number occasions. Accordingly, the CID cannot consider
supporting a disclosure of their assistance to the FBI - even as
PCIs - absent an effort to locate and contact survivors to
ascertain the potential impact of the proposed disclosure on
them.

Tab 2)

a) PCI E. L. Keith - Appeal - The source was
subsequently opened as a symboled source and utilized as such for
a 5 year period. Although he/she deceased, there is no
information regarding the existence of surviving family members.
Accordingly, the CID cannot consider supporting a disclosure of
his assistance to the FBI - even as a PCI - absent an effort to
locate and contact survivors to ascertain the potential impact of
the proposed disclosure on them.

b) PCI Kit Pettigrew - Appeal - Records indicate
that he is still alive. . The CID cannot consider the releasing
his identity unless/until he is contacted and agrees to the
proposed disclosure.

c) PCIs B. Howard Thorne and Ralph T. Trujillo -
Release - A good faith search of Bureau and public records has
revealed no data allowing the PCIs to be further identified
located, and advised of the proposed release.

a) PCI Edmond Zufferey - Appeal - It is unclear
as to whether this name has already been released. If no release
has occured, the CID cannot consider a release, until he is
contacted and agrees to the proposed disclosure, or until a good
faith search of Bureau and public records has revealed that there
is no data allowing the him to be further identified located, and
advised of the proposed release.

Tab 3) PSI Sylverio Hernandez - Appeal - Unless a
determination regarding this source would more appropriately be
made by the NSD, the CID recommends an appeal inasmuch as the
source provided long-term, albeit sporadic, assistance in highly
sensitive areas; was just closed in 1985, and, apparently, is
still alive but has not yet been contacted to ascertain the

‘ impact of disclosure on him.

Memorandum dated 3/26/96 to Mrs. Morris from J. Kevin O'Brien
Re: JFK Task Force

=
ADDENDUM: _CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION (CID 14/96
SLT:slt

Reference 8/3/95 CID addendum to memorandum dated
7/28/95 to William E. Baugh, Jr. from John A. Hartingh, entitled
“JFK Task Force."

Based on the general rationale articulated in the
referenced addendum, and that set forth below, the CID takes the
following position with regard to those proposed releases
relating to CID sources:

Tab 1)

a) PCI Jack Patrick Hanratty - Appeal - Although
the source is deceased, there is no information regarding the
existence of surviving family members. The source was used as a
top echelon informant for a five year period. Due to his access
to high levels within organized crime circles, and their known
penchant for violent retaliation, the CID cannot consider
supporting a disclosure of his assistance to the FBI - even asa ~~
PCI - absent an effort to locate and contact survivors to
ascertain the potential impact of the proposed disclosure on
them.

b) PCIs Jack Marvin, Mary Halbouty, Ceasar J.
Ferris, Robert S. Yarrington, J.H. Stelfox, Charles B. Flora,
Barney Ham, Ralph Greenwood Salter, Leonard Simpson, J. C.
Stephenson - Release - A good faith search of Bureau and public
records has revealed no data allowing the PCIs to be further
identified located, and advised of the proposed releases.

c) PCI Phil Bordonaro - Appeal Unless
Reassessment Following Ten Year Postponement Is Allowed - A ten
year extended postponement is insufficient if it mandates
automatic disclosure at the end of that period and would preclude
the FBI from contacting the PCI to re-assess the risks of
disclosure.

da) PCIs Vance F. Bordelon and Marion C. Pearson
Appeal - There is no information reflecting efforts to determine
the existence of surviving family members of these individuals.
Accordingly, the CID cannot consider supporting a disclosure of
the sources' assistance to the FBI - even as PCIs - absent an
effort to locate and contact survivors to ascertain the potential
impact of the proposed disclosure on them.

Meniorandum from J. Kevin O’Brien to Mrs. Morris, dated 3/26/96
Re: JFK Task Force
62-HQ-1029205

DETAILS: On or about 4/2/96, the ARRB will formally advise, by
letter to the Director, the determinations voted by them on FBI
documents at meetings held 2/29 - 3/1/96 and 3/18 - 19/96. The
ARRB letter will list determinations including the following
actions: the release of 44 potential criminal informant (PCI)
| identities, the protection of seven PCIs, the release of 20
| potential security informant (PSI) identities, the release of 2
individuals’ identities cen te as security informants (SI), the
release of 11 Cuban sources he protection of the technical Cs
surveillance on the Israeli Embassy, Washington, D.C.\ the
release of information from a technical surveillance” on the Cuban
Mission, the release of information from a technical surveillance
of a Polish diplomatic establishment, and the sustainment of all
information related to the "Soviet" matters with a release date
of August, 1996. Of the 41 documents, the FBI is in agreement
with the ARRB decision to sustain the postponements in 12
documents. (

A review of the ARRB decisions to date provides the
following observations:

a. individuals listed as PCIs in FBI documents for
which the FBI Headquarters and field office confidential indices
are negative or a review of FBI records determines the PCI
deceased without a potential threat to family members are
released; those PCIs that the FBI provides background for, but
can not determine if they are living or deceased, the ARRB is
deciding by birth date whether to release; and those PCIs the FBI
was able to establish as still living, and involved in criminal
activity are protected for 10 years;

b. individuals listed as PSIs are only protected if
they have provided life threatening information, those PSIs or_
SIs providing information on communist party matters or anti
Castro matters have been released; the ARRB staff has suggested
that PSIs or SIs who were possibly double agents or working
closely with foreign establishments where a potential threat
could be perceived would be protected, but this situation has not
yet been tested;

c. Cuban sources are released, these individuals have
usually been listed with common names and are very difficult
searching and positively identifying;

d. sources of information, gambling informants, and

established sources follow the same guidelines as PCIs unless
\ developed into security sources. (U)
