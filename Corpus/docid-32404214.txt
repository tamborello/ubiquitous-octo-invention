19 August 1993

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

VIA: Executive Director

FROM: David D. Gries
Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence

SUBJECT: Release of JFK Documents

1. By Monday evening, 23 August, CIA will have met the
deadline for release of JFK assassination records. Although the
1992 Act fixed Sunday, 22 August, as the deadline, the National
Archives has determined that Monday, 23 August, is the working
deadline.

2. One shipment of 23,000 pages was sent to Archives on
Monday, 16 August. This shipment is the subject of the New York
Times article of 19 August, which states incorrectly that CIA
"would make public only about 23,000 pages of documents." PAI is
contacting the Times in an effort to correct the record.

3. A second and much larger shipment will be sent to
Archives in stages on Friday, Saturday, and Monday, 20-23 August.

4. Although we are pleased to have met the deadline,
redactions on many pages and the approximately 10,000 pages
withheld in total are likely to lead to criticism, especially
from long-time critics like James Lesar, who is quoted in the
Times article.

 

5. After passage of the deadline, CIA will still retain
some JFK records. As noted, 10,000 pages are being withheld -in
total because they describe sensitive sources and methods.
Approximately 7,000 pages originated by other agencies but found
in CIA files and sent to originating agencies for coordination
have not yet been returned to CIA for release. Approximately
20,000 pages originated by Congressional staffers during the
assassination investigation are‘ stored atJCIA and ultimately must
be processed for release by Arthives, whitch has been delegated
authority by Congress to review records originated by Congress.

SUBJECT: Release of JFK Documents

Finally, CIA holds 73 reels of microfilm which we intend to ask
the Review Board created by the 1992 Act to exempt from release
because a large portion qualify for postponement on grounds of
sensitivity, privacy, irrelevance, or duplication of records
already released.

5. CIA involvement with JFK records will continue into the
future. The White,House has yet to appoint a Review Board. When
it does, the Board will have the right to review all records
redacted or withheld. This process is likely to require years of
effort and much debate back and forth.
