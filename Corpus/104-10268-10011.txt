!

Today, Friday, March 27, cal ‘I met at lb ed with
Ne. Rocca to review the CIA file on Leo Harvey Oswald. Tie file
-¢ontains those materials furnished to us previously ty CIA. in
eddition, 1b. contains the following materials:

a. Cable reports from the CIA station in Mexico of Novexber

! 22 and 23, 1953 relating to photogranhs of a person who had visited
| tho Cuban ond Soviet Erbassics in Mexico city duxing October and

: Novenber. 1953; and reports on these cables furnished on Eovorber _ -
| 23 by CIA to the Sceres Service. These messaces are accurately .
no parcphrasea in the attachments to the CIA menorondum of Horch 2h,

1934 {Conmtlasion Document wOT). oo

>. Cable of October 10 from CIA Heickeo City ctation to CIA ©
headquarters rcporting on Oswald contact at Soviet Embassy, and
October 10, 1963 message from CIA headquarters to Mexico City station
of background information on Oswald. ‘These messages are accurately
xeported in the CIA momorandum of January 31, 1964.

I did not review ony materials later than Noveahor 23, 1963.

. Mr. Rocea also showad me the “printout” of the references to
Oswald documents in the CIA electronic data storage system. There
was no iten Moted which we have not been Given either in full text

When I evidenced an interest in the CIA electronic data
processing system, Hr. Rocca said that he would arrange a Gotailed
explanation at a future visit. ; a

DURAN te tell OBWALD be could

frank statements are quite common in Gat Newitt in
practice, ae fer as we kno.

6. We believe thet Silvia DURAN's statomént thet an
OSWALD keew oo ono be Cuba meant eerally thet, and rs
this would mean that ag gee there could spencer him,
vouch for him, or insure thet he would not become 3
