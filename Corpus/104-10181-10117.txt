5. Ido retain a distinct recollection that the DRE leader-
ship, specifically Luis FERNANDEZ Rocha, whom I met several
times, did hold sentiments of chagrin and embitterment that
President Kennedy had not more forcefully pursued a "liberation"
of Cuba. Whether or not this aninius, which could be discerned
as occasional signs of anger or of contempt or of discouragement,
might have been translated into a wish for revenge, may be better
known to other officers who dealt with this group after the summer

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Possible DRE Animus Towards President Kennedy

1, This memorandum makes record of a recollection
which has been brought to mind in recent weeks since my return
from Yugoslavia in late November 1966.

2. In Spring 1961, upon returning from Berlin I was
assigned to JMWAVE. One of the cases on which I worked from
then until shortly before my reassignment to Headquarters in
late summer 1963 concerned funding of overseas elements of
the DRE (Student Revolutionary Directorate) which had its main
office in Miami (the case officer for this group during this
period was Mr. Ross CROZIER, since resigned).

3. Ibelieve that it is this group, the DRE, which has been
referred to in investigations into the President's assassination
as the Cuban Student Directorate, whose New Orleans represen-
tative is said to have had contacts with OSWALD,

4, Thave assumed that, since the time I was transferred
from Miami and scheduled for my next assignment as feos, at
officers better and more recently informed than myself
ave probably éxamined in detail all aspects of the DRE involve-
ment with OSWALD, in order to rule out any slight possibility
that compromise of the CIA sponsorship of this organization
might in any way embarrass the Agency. Recent news reports of
investigations centering in New Orleans on the assassination have
once again brought to mind the concern | felt in November 1963,
by which time, however, I was far removed from current knowledge

of the operation,
