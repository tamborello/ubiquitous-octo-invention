MM T-1, who has been active in Cuban revolutionary
matters for the past six years, advised during July, August
and September, 1963 that MANUEL ARTIME BUESA continues to be
‘the head of the Movimiento Recuperacion Revolucionario (MRR),
an anti-CASTRO organization which maintains an office at 22
N. E. 23rd Street, ami, Florida. U j

Com T-1 jadvised that during July, August and Septem-

ber, 1963, AT 's followers were out trying to obtain names
of Cuban exiles in Miami as future recruits for a military
training camp in Central America to be established by ARTIME.
A majority of young Cuban exiles were reluctant to volunteer
and claimed that they would not go to any training camp until ~)
they receive assurance that the United States Government
approves the camp. Many of the exiles recall the Playa
Giron Invasion failure of Cuba and do not want to be involved
in any future milit a action that might fail. ge

, Cm anno that ARTIME's. recruiters have
had great difficulty in obtaining names of would-be recruits.
The Cuban exiles of military age quickly point
out that ARTIME has no military training or background and
lacks the political backing of the majority of the Cuban
exile leaders. They also point out that although ARTIME was
one of the’ leading figures in Brigade 2506, that participated
in the Playa Giron Invasion, he does not have the backing
of this organization. Ye

: On’ September 4, 1963 the "Miami Herald", a

daily newspaper published in Miami, Florida, contained
an article which stated that ARTIME announced he had ;
Warned FIDEL CASTRO RUZ,. Prime Minister of Cuba, that A!
henceforth the MRR would kill three CASTRO men for every —~:
Cuban killed by the CASTRO Regime. ARTIME stated that the

beginning of the MRR move to Central America from Miami
was then underway, that military missions against Cuba
had begun and would be accelerated.
