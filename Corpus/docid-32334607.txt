MM 105-4921 _SONBIBENTTAL
, ADMINISTRATIVE

One copy of this report is being furnished.
locally to U. S. Secret Service due to their interest
in the "Minutemen" organization,

One ' copy of this report is being furnished
Jacksonville and Tampa for information to apprise these
offices re the "Minutemen" in the Miami Field Division.

This report is classified CONFIDENTIAL, since
the disclosure of the identities of the informants
contained therein could be detrimental to the security
of this country.

In an attempt to determine the activities of
"Minutemen" in the Miami Field Division, Miami has opened
PSI investigations on two individuals in the West Palm
Beach area’ who have received this organization's
literature unsolicited and have so advised this office.
As the Bureau is aware, Miami received authority by Bulet
dated January 7, 1965, to have MM 639-S correspond with
the national headquarters of "Minutemen." The above
individuals have been instructed that our sole purpose
is to identify any possible local units of "Minutemen",
and no attempt will be made by them to reofuit or:
institute a unit of this organization, u)

. As noted in relet, "Minutemen" literature
was also directed to ROBERT G, BELL, Sr., 1700 N. W.
113th Terrace, Miami, Florida. Rerep, page 3, noted that
BELL had moved from the Miami area to California, during
1963 or 1964, Inquiry with the Postal Inspector's office
determined that BELL moved from the above address on
July 19, 1963, and left no forwarding address. No further
investigation is warranted concerning BELL, since he
apparently is not currently receiving this organization’ 8
literature.

THOMAS C. BENNETT, Sr., upon interview, ini-
tially stated all he knew of the "Minutemen" was what
he had read in the newspapers and heard over the radio.

MM 105-4921 TONEBATIAL
He subsequently admitted receiving literature from the
organization's headquarters regularly. Although he

was not hostile, he was not overly friendly, and
appeared to resent being questioned about the organization.

EDWARD JAMARILLO, Jr., during interview,
appeared to be a highly excitable and extremely talkative
individual. He stated that the large majority of his time
was spent reading “conservative literature." He appeared
to be extremely disturbed that the Communist element and
the United Nations were about to "take over the United
States."

‘ KLESMER E. LOWRY, during interview, seemed to
resent being contacted regarding "Minutemen" and inquired
why the FBI would investigate such an organization. He
remarked that Vice President HUMPHREY, during his recent
campaign speeches, made several unfavorable references to
"Minutemen" and LOWRY felt that Mr. HUMPHREY was responsible
for the FBI making inquiry concerning this organization.
“LOWRY was told that the Agents were unaware of any such
references by the Vice President, and that he was incorrect
in his assumption.

It is not felt at this time that any of the
individuals interviewed possess informant potential.
