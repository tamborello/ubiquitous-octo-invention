but not to mislead this Agency in any material matters of an operational
or policy nature. :

In orcer to avoid any misunderstanding of the phrase "bona
fides" as considered in this summary, NOSENKO will be judged primarily
on whetacr he voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB knowledge,
and whether his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with representatives of this
Agency were known to ‘the. KGB. Motivation and certain other pertinent
aspects will be considered, but hi his admitted previous errors, ‘Mes and
exaggerations will not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is nota
“yona fide" defector.

There is not an accurate standard or scale of measurement
against which information concerning NOSENKO can be balanced or .
correlated to determine if he is or is not a dispatched KGB officer, For
purposes of this analysis and summary, an arbitrary list of areas
considered pertinent has been compiled, . Readers may differ in regard to
whether this arbitrary standard is a completely accurate standard, but it
ia felt that the information from NOSENKO and information from other
sources derived through independent investigation will permit the reader
to assess the information -in toto against any standard he considers
appropriate.

The previous summary on NOSENKO entitled, “The. Exami-

7 INTRODUCTION

The following summary and analysis is not intended to be
all inclusive, that is to contain a specific comment on all organi=
zational, operational, personality and case type information furnished
by Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO: To attempt to do ‘20 ‘would be repetitious
and confusing to the reader and would not be of material benefit in the
formation of logical conclusions concerning the rather limited areas of
primary concern.
This summary will not contain a detailed psychological
" assessment of NOSENKO nor will it contain a Zecitation of the numerous
theories which have been-promulgated in ‘the past concerning varying
‘aspects of the NOSENKO case. This summary will be primarily
directed toward the question of whether NOSENKO was or was not
dispatched by the KGB, whether his claimed KGB career is relatively
plausible and whether he has since late October 1967 been cooperative in
; a reassessment of the entire case for or ‘against NOSENKO. NOSENKO

has admitted certain lies and exaggerations in the past but claims that

. these were of a personal nature, intended to enhance his own importance
