1. Reference is made to your request for Operational Approval
dated 5 September 1953, which was received. in CI/OA on 9 September
1953. In response to a priority need as expressed by the Division,

& Provisicnal Operational Approval for operational use was granted
orally on the basis of Subject’s recent staff and contract employment
with this Agency. Immediate approval was issued also on the basis

of an oral report frov. the Office of Security to the effect that
their files contained no derogatory information regarding Subject.

2. As @ result of later consultationsiwith the Office of Se-
curity, it has been determined thet further ‘processing toward full
Operational Approval will require the usual ‘routine checks by the
Division (Green List, RI traces, operetional, Division and, if appli-
esdle, Field traces). An up-to-date PRQ Part I, while desirable for
CI;cA record purposes, will not be insisted upon. Submittal of PrQ
Part II, huwever, will be required during the six-month pericd of .
Provisional Operational Approval validity.
