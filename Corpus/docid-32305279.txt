night of April 21. BOSCH then drove MM 639-S to the
Bacardi Building, Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, where

BOSCH picked up GUAJIRO. They then drove to the Boulevard

MM 639-S, the bombs would be transported from Miami to
Naples. BOSCH said that he and his companions would

be waiting for a telephonic message from MM 639-S at

Customs who had already been briefed on previous
developments. Mr. SHANLEY and Mr. SCHACHTER had already
worked out a plan of action in agreement with this office
and the Collier County Sheriff's Office with the thou

in mind of giving maximum protection to MM 639-8. YU

nt
At 9:40 P.M., 4-21-66, MM 639-S advised mol
was ready to depart Miami International Airport and had
just notified BOSCH, who said he would immediately bring
the co-pilot to. the airport. MM 639-S had rented at Florida
Airmotive Sales, Inc., Fort Lauderdale International Airport,
a twin-engine Cessna 310-I, Registration 8137M, with wing tip

tanks. (Ky @)

Before his departure, MM 639-S was alerted by this
office of the fact that he would be interrogated by a Collier
County deputy at the airport as a possible suspect. but that
he would not be arrested. (&) W)

At 1:30 A.M., Mr. SHANLEY telephonically notified
this office that BOSCH and two companions had, just been
arrested by the Collier County Sheriff's Office in possession
of six bombs 15 miles east of Naples.

Subsequently Mr. SHANLEY and Mr. SCHACHTER furnished
the following details which are of interest to the Bureau.

in cooperation with Customs, Sheriff HENDRY set up
a road block 15 miles east of Naples. This road block was
manned by two deputies and one Customs agent dressed as a
deputy sheriff. From a concealed point Customs observed
the two cars, bearing the Cubans, as it approached the road
block from a point 5 miles east. When the two cars came to
the road block, the deputies simulated a search for two
escaped convicts from a Collier County prison camp. One
deputy, dressed as a convict and wearing handcuffs, was
brought from the adjoining field to an official car along
with a bloodhound to simulate the capture of one of the
two convicts. The sheriff, within hearing of BOSCH and his
companions, made appropriate. radio calls and instructed a Yu.) .
