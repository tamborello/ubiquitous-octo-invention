NO 92-603 .
ADMINISTRATIVE:

. As previously reported, NOFIO PECORA was contacted
on 8/2/68 and voluntarily furnished information concerning —
FBI case captioned "ELDON JUNIOR LEGAN, aka IJTAR-GAMBLING and
PROSTITUTION 00: SAN ANTONIO, NO 166-35."

During this interview, PECORA appeared cooperative
and has since been designated a target under the TECIP in the
New Orleans Division. :

PECORA was subsequently contacted under the
TECIP program as NO 1283-PC on 12/10/68, and furnished
the following information:

He initially denied any knowledge of the Mafia
but later conceded that, as a youngster growing up in New
Orleans, he knew of some individuals who had the reputation
of being "black hands." They were old men, SAM SEGRETTO, —
(FNU) FORRESTIERE, and. (FNU) GIACONA, all of whom are dead.
He also stated that JOE PECK's father (PECORARO) was in this
same classification.

Although he claimed to know nothing of the Mafia,
he repeatedly made statements directly opposed to this
contention, such as "I never messed around with those
guys," and "I had no. use for those guys." He admitted that
he was friendly with SYLESTRO "SAM" CAROLLO, father of
ANTHONY CAROLLO, who was deported in the early 1950's.

He stated, in fact, that he was in business with SAM

CAROLLRO in the St. Charles Tavern and received financial

backing from ANDREW MONTE, He got out of this business

with CAROLLO because CAROLLO brought in all his relatives,

both sons and a son-in-law, and he felt that there was ~ .
.too much nepotism.

He stated that JOE PECK's father's name was
BATISTTA PECORARO, and he recalled an incident of about
14 years ago when he first opened up his present business
and began doing well, he was approached by ANTHONY CAROLLO
and JOE PECK, who tried to muscle him out of a piece
(percentage) of his business, and he told them where to
go, stating .'My gun was closer than theirs at the time
of confrontation."" He further made the remarks that no
one had better try to muscle him, or he would take ‘care
of them.
