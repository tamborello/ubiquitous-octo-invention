Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act
of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The Act established the Assassination Records Review
Board (ARRB) to oversee the governments' production and
compliance with the Act. The ARRB reviews the proposed -
postponements.in documents sent by each agency to the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and decides what
postponements the Act will allow or opens the document in full.
The ARRB's responsibilities’ include having agencies search other
subjects and areas to find any additional material not already
identified as assassination records. The establishment of the
ARRB by the Act also limited the time for their duties to be
accomplished. The ARRB.must complete their tasks by September
1997. With this deadline in mind, the ARRB sent a letter
requesting additional information.

Enclosures: ARRB letter requesting material

Details: On March 10, 1997, the ARRB sent a letter to the FBI
setting forth a formal request to receive and review additional
records. The ARRB's goal is to research every possible subject
that may have a bearing on assassination theories and to assure
Congress and the ‘American public that all was done to accomplish

the intentions of the Act.

Requested offices should conduct a search for the
listed items. If offices are aware of any administrative records
they may have maintained outside the normal index system, they
should include those areas in the search. If any documents
related to the matters are found, please forward the documents to

the JFK Task Force. (C2 HO ~/O2.9 2O8$~ 3396
