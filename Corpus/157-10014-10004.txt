WAeo & PAUL

 

 

When did you first hear about this meeting, if
fact you did hear about it?
Mr. Angleton. Well, I think the first news came

when Helms called me, and I believe it was with Tom Kara-

messines, and simply stated that there would be a rather extra

ordinary meeting in the White House. I think he did mention |
the principals being the Executive of the USIB

and Mr. Hoover. And that the President made some very strong:
statements’ regarding the aack of domestic intelligence on the
incidents of the time. And therefore, that he had set up --
wanted a working group set up by the principles. And in

the course of this discussion, which was very short, he
nominated me to be the agency representative, and Dick Ober

to be my legman.

Mr. Johnson. Did Mr. Helms give you any additional
feeling for what that meeting was about? ,

Mr. Angleton. He didn't really haye to, because the
question of what was going on in the country was burning in
every investigative agency or agency in government. In
other words, it was not -- the Huston Plan was jast simply the
momentum of what was happening in the country.

Mr. Johnson. Couldyou be more explicit when you say

what was happening in the country?

: y.
Mr. Angleton. Well, the question of bombings, the

questions of protest, the question of travel abroad -~ all

the things which a contemporary newspaper would set forth,
and the statistics which Director Kelley can give you ad nause
on which there was not coverage. To put it bluntly, as it
came through to me -~ and this is the reason I think the
thing was rather short -- it was a question everybody was
asking themselves, basically, that the President of the U.S.
did not feel-he had any answers, and, therefore, was more an
anger in reaction to the inability of the country to give
him answers.

Mr. Johnson. So the summer of 1970 there was perceived
to be a definite internal security threat?

Mr, Angleton. It had been growing for a long time.

Mr. Johnson. As the leading counter intelligence
expert in the CIA, did you have any concrete evidence yourself:

that there was. a foreign connection.to this domestic worest?

Mr. Angleton. The way I would comment on that is
simply that the intelligence that we had gathered, fundamentally
from December '61 on through, that the counter intelligence
effort in the government was very important.

Mr. Johnson. Does that include the effort of the
Central Intelligence Agency?

Mr. Angleton. Absolutely.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Johnson. Before the telephone rang we were talking

about the inadequacies of the counter intelligence effort

is present, but leaving.

Mr. Angleton, do you wish to make a brief opening
statement before we begin to talk about the Huston Plan?

Mr Angleton. No, I really don't. I say that because
as of the end of December, just’ shortly before Christmas, I
have had not really had much access to my files, basically in
the sense that a legman necessarily would pull things together.

{Y imagine that with the number of personnel the Rockefeller
Commission had, the number of personnel that you had, that
you will get all the relevant documents.

Senator Schweiker. I hope we do. We will sure try it.

Mr. Angleton. The Huston Plan is literally about five-
eighths of an inch thick, and I think half of it is a blue-
covered ‘report. In other words, there is nothing much
by way of files.

Mr. Johnson. I like to forget by tracing chronologically
the events surrounding the so-called Huston plan. And it is ny
understanding that the first import nt event in this episode
has to do with a meeting held in the President's office on
June 5, 1970. And at this meeting were the principals of
the intelligence community, of course, including Nr. Helms

present?

Senator Schweiker. Mr. Angleton, the first thing we will

do is swear you in.

Will you stand and raise your right hand, please?

Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to

give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

 

Mr. Angleton. I do.

Senator Schweiker. As you know, since you have been
‘here before, a Senator is normally present at all times during
the testimony. However, with the press of Senate duties we
have not been able to effectuate that fully. So if I have
to leave -- and I will have to.leave for at least a substantial
portion -- you have the right to hold up your testimony until
a Senator is returned.

So would you be willing to proceed without a Senator

Senator Schweiker. Yes. We let every witness see it
and correct it. So there is no problem there whatever.

Mr. Angleton. To me it is immaterial one way or the
