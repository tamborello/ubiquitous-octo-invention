Concerning associates in New York City, informant
said that although ROSSELLI was with ORMENTO when they iast
met, ROSSELLI was never a close associate of ORMENTO, Instead,
in New York City, ROSSELLI was close to FRANK COSTELLO, THOMAS

\ ILUCHESE, and VITO GENOVESE prior to the time VITO GENOVESE

NN became “boss of bosses".

Informant related the following story that
occurred while both were inmates in Atlanta, approximately

1946-1947 :

Informant said on one occasion, he told TOSSELLI that
he had a girl friend in New York City who was close to him but
since she only earned $40-$50.00 per week could not afford to
see him in Atlanta. Unbeknown to informant, ROSSELLI then |
approached PETE DI PALERMO, also known as Petie Beck, brother
of JOSEPH and CHARLIE DI PALERMO, who was being discharged
from Atlanta Penitentiary and instructed that PETIE see THOMAS
LUCHESE and have LUCHESE give this girl money. Informant said
sometime thereafter this girl friend visited him in Atlanta
and explained that she had been given $300.00 and was receiving
$50.00 per week from informant's "friends".

: Informant recalled that on one occasion during this
period, ROSSELLI had told him that WILLIE MORETTI, also

known aS Willie Moore, characterized as "an Eastern representative
for the RICCA family and ROSETTI's contact man", was "blowing
his top" and was telling people of his association with
ROSELLI, which upset ROSSELLI. Informant said a few years
subsequent to this, WILRIE MORETTI was murdered by an
ANASTASIA "soldier", JOHN ROBILOTTO, also known as Johnny
Roberts, who himseif was subsequently murdered during the
period when ANASTASIA and his "“underboss", TOMMY RAVA were
killed.

Informant said he recalled that ROSELLI was also
closely associated with MIKE COPPOLA in Miami, Florida, as
well as "FAT TONY" SALERNO, Informant said that ROSSELLI was
also close with the MASSI (ph) brothers who wield considerable
LCN power in Cleveland, Ohio, and with JOHNNY MITCHELL, true
name unknown, who was an LCN. member from Chicago, but now
resides in Miami. Informant stated that the attorney previously
mentioned by him is definitely JOSEPH BULGER and was certain of
the fact that ROSSELLI on more than one occasion had advised
him that BULGER was an LCN "soldier" from Kansas City.

INFORMATION REGARDING ROSSELLI'S
LCN. AFFILIATION

By memorandum dated August 22, 1966, the New
York Office furnished the following information: |

On August 19, 1966 NY 1839-C-TE, an admitted member
of the LUCHESE "family" of LCN, advised SA ANTHONY R. VILLANO
of the following information concerning subject:

Informant advised that he first met ROSSELLI many
years ago and was aware that ROSSELLI was originally from
Chicago and had an uncle who was an old time Mafiosa.

According to informant, ROSSELLI started.in "the rackets" at
the age of 15 and was at an early age associated with AL
CAPONE, Informant said during the mid,1940!s ROSSELLI received
a.10 year sentence for extortion in connection with the movie
industry and that also involved in this extortion was PAUL
.RICCA, JOE DIAMOND (deceasea), CHARLIE JOY (deceased), and.
LOUIS COMPAGNA (deceased).

Informant said previously ROSSELLI was sent to
Los Angeles by RICCA, acted as a "sottocapo" and took over
Los Angeles and extended his influence to Las Vegas.

Informant said sometime prior to this incarceration
BENNY THE BUG STEGAL (deceased), went to California and there
was "set up" by ROSELLI, ROSSELLI at that time was in the
early stages of investing approximately 2 million dollars of
illegitimate money received from "the cutfit" in Chicago in
the Flamingo at Las Vegas.

Upon ROSSELLI!s conviction, this assignment with the
accompanying money was turned over to BENNY THE BUG, who had
apparently been playing the stock market and had lost heavily,
including the above monies,

. Informant advised that ROSSELLI at that time had
also been invJdved with a movie starlet who had corresponded
with ROSSELLI in Atlanta Penitentiary during approximately
1945, . ROSSELLI also learned that BENNY THE BUG was playing
with the sister of this starlet and had almost reduced her to
a common prostitute.

\

Informant said that both these incidents had
apparently so angered ROSSELLZ that approximately ty) weeks
prior to SIEGAL's assassination, he had advised informant
that BENNY would be killed, which occurred according to
ROSSELLI's prediction.

Informant: continued that he had heard that ROSSELLI, .
fronting for the Chicago mob, had put up large sums of money
for pieces of the Flamingo, the Sands, and most recently
Caesar's Palace, all in Las Vegas. “Informant said ROSSELLI
has the reputation of being the man in charge of Las Vegas.

Informant also advised that ROSSELLI at one time told
him that a lawyer, whose name may be JOE and who comes from
Kansas City, visited him and PAUL RICCA in Atlanta during
approximately 1946 and is also a "soldier" in LCN. Informant
said this individual's name would no doubt be reflected in the
penitentiary records of ROSSELLI's visitors.

Informant advised that as of approximately one year
ago he was advised that the way to contact ROSSELLI was through
tne Bella Napoli Restaurant in Beverly Hills, California.

By airtel. dated August 29, 1966, to the Bureau,
the Los Angeies Office furnished certain background
