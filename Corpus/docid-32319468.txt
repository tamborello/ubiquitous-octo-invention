. The attached newspaper stories alleged°that "Alex
-Rorke, a wealthy adventurer who worked for both CIA and the
FBI" was involved with Frank Fiorini,.a "CIA Agent}’ who: recruited
jthe subject in an assassination plot against Castro.
fplexander I. Rorke is a former FBI clerical employee who, during :
the time of the alleged plot in 1960, was a free lance .
hotographer., He had been temporarily detained ‘by the Cuban
- Government in 1959 and for many years. was active in anti-Castro .
activities in the Florida-area. From:time to time he contacted
the FBI and was dealt with at arms length because of his
adventurer, personality and self-serving motives. He disappeared
on a plane flight in 1963 to Central America. Frank Fiorini
also.known as Frank Anthony ;Sturgis was well known to the FBI
for his anti-Castro activities in the U. S. ‘following his- . .
defection from Cuba in 1958. He was. also one of .the Watergate —
‘break-in subjects. : ; ; 7 7 :

_ POSSIBLE QUESTIONS FROM THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES REGARDING THE INVESTIGATION OF

THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY

 

Rather than attempting to forecast actual questions,
the following is a summary of areas in which the Senate Select
committee (SSC) has shown interest since the publication of the
final report of the Senate Select Committee to study Governmental

Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities.

The Alleged Jack Ruby Trip to Cuba

 

 

Newspaper articles have reported that Frank Sturgis,
"a former CIA Agent" has testified before the Senate Intelligence
committee that Jack Ruby met with Fidel castro in Havana during :
the Summer of 1963, and discussed the possibility of assassinating
President Kennedy.

Frank Anthony Sturgis, true name Frank Fiorini, has won
recent notoriety as one of the Watergate burglars. Fiorini
was interviewed by the FBI in November of 1963 and in January and
April of 1964 regarding his knowledge of Leé Harvey Oswald. These
interviews resulted from newspaper” atticles quoting him as saying
that Oswald had telephone conversations with Cuban Intelligence

during November of 1962. The articles further quote Fiorini as

 

stating that Oswald contacted Miami-based supporters of Fidel
Castro and that Oswald had connections with the Cuban Government
in Mexico and in New Orleans. Fiorini further claimed,

according to the articles, that Oswald handed out pro-Castro

Ta reference to your communication of August 27, 1976
(RLT.WSL:GS:sd) and my response of September 8, 1976, captioned
as above, the following additional information is provided.

A further review of our files revealed information
regarding Ilona Marita Lorenz, who appears to be identical to
the Merita Lorenz about whom you inguired. Our files reflect
that Marita Lorenz, date of birth August 18, 1939, at Breman,
Germany, was initially in contact with the New York Office of
the FBI on November 20, 1959.. This contact was arranged with
the New York Office by Alexander I. Rorke through Lorenz's mother.
' _. During this initial. interview, she furnished information
concerning contacts with Fidel Castro. In later interviews
she revealed that she voluntarily traveled to Cuba in 1959
where she had a.love affaix with Castro. This affair resulted
in an involuntary abortion in Cuba. In 1959 and 1960 Jesus
Yenez Pelletier, Military Aid to Castro, traveled to New York
.where he contacted Lorenz and offered to pay medical expenses
for surgery resulting from the abortion. He also attempted
to convince Loreng to return to Cuba. Lorenz was fearful of
being kidnaped and requested FBI assistance but the New York.
office advised her there was no FBI jurisdiction and referred her
to the New York City Police Department if she: felt she needed
protection.

oo In 1960, Lorenz ‘Ss nother wrote ‘a letter to castro
: : concerning his alleged rape of Marita Lorenz. This letter ‘and

. “publicity at the time. Additional information in our files . ‘
