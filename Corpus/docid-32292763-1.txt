On 6/9/69 ANTHONY BARLOTTA (NO 92-931) confidentially
advised SA THOMAS L. COLARELLI and SA’ J.° LEE SAVILLE that it
was HAYES "DUKE" DUGAS (NO 92-882) who picked up
JUNIOR PROVENZANO-out of the Malibu Lounge on 5/27/69. He
stated it was‘his understanding that DUGAS was acting on his
own, rather than at CARLOS MARCELLO's direction, because
DUGAS wanted "a piece of the action," meaning the loot. He
stated that ELDON LEGAN hasbeen out of town for three or
four days, and he personally did not expect to see him return.
However, since he has returned, he (BARLOTTA) has concluded
that PROVENZANO must have gotten his share of the loot,
because LEGAN and PROVENZANO are acting too much like guilty
parties since the swindle.

He stated that it is LEGAN who is keeping
PROVENZANO quiet. He stated that ‘all you would have to do
to get PROVENZANO to talk would be to lock him in jail for
72 hours and he would tell you anything you wanted to know.!

The following investigation was conducted at Gretna,
Louisiana, on June 6,*1969, by Special Agent J. LEE SAVILLE:

Mr. JOE ODDO, Manager, The Malibu, 4th Street,
Marrero (protect identity) , advised that he had obtained his
most recent Jefferson Parish Health Card from Dr. R.:T. RIBANDO,
approximately six months ago. ODDO stated that he had not (|!
undergone any tests for this card and that. it had just been
issued to him directly by RIBANDO.. He stated that. it was
fairly common for RIBANDO to «issue phony health cards to
"characters" on the West Bank, most of whom were employed in
bars in the 4th Street area. ns . ;

On 5/24/69 PCI ART DIAMOND advised that he had

“talked to JUNIOR PROVENZANO that® date and that PROVENZANO~had
: provided the following information: .. .*

PROVENZANO , ELDON LEGAN, Dr. RIBANDO, Dr. CARUSO, and
CLYDE BOURGEOIS had been swindled out of $110, 000 the previous
Thursday in Ferriday, La. They had been slanning to purchase
some stolen.diamonds. PCI asked PROVENZANO if he had been
involved inthe swindle. PROVENZANO stated he was not involved
and that hexhad lost some money also. PCI asked if JACKI PIZZI
was involved, and PROVENZANO also:denied that. PCI noted that
at that time PROVENZANO was not wearing his large diamond ring
which contains a 53 carat stone. “PCI noted that PROVENZANO
was not wearing the ring prior to traveling to Ferriday. PCI
advised that BUDDY PIZZI was in Marrero about one week before
the swindle’. ‘took place. He stated. that BUDDY and JACKI PIZZ1I
are known. to be swindlers and con ‘artists. He has never seen
the PIZZIS in direct contact with -PROVENZANO; however, he
observed BUDDY. PIZZI talking to CHINK (LNU), who runs the -
middle bar in the Moulin Rouge for PROVENZANO. PCI believes
that the PIZZIS are probably involved in the swindle, and that
JIMMY JAMES may also be involved, since they have been known
to work together.

that JAMES and PIZZI pulled a swindle similar to the
Ferriday swindle in Chicago sometime since December, 1968,
in which they obtained $140,000; MORRIS has no further
details concerning that operation. MORRIS advised that
JAMES is using that money to pay off his legal fees
regarding a gambling charge.

JOE ODDO told PCI that the man who went to the
Malibu Lounge Tuesday evening to get JUNIOR PROVENZANO was
JOE MARCELLO. ELDON LEGAN had been picked up that same

‘ evening and they were not even taken back to the Malibu,

but were dropped off at the hospital in Marrero, where
LEGAN received medical attention for a cut arm. PCI also
stated that one reason that CARLOS MARCELLO was unhappy
about the whole situation was that JUNIOR PROVENZANO called
ROCK HEBERT and CARLOS long distance the day the swindle
took place in Ferriday.

NO 1734-C-TE advised on 5/26/69 that
CARLOS MARCELLO received a telephone call from
CLYDE BOURGEOIS, and MARCELLO left almost immediately to
meet with BOURGEOIS at BOURGEOIS’ residence. Source
advised that MARCELLO was accompanied by. NICK NUCCIO in
NUCCIO's car. Informant stated that NICK NUCCIO is
associated with CARLOS’ brother ANTHONY MARCELLO in several
newsstands in the city. He further advised that
NICK NUCCIO is the brother of JOE NUCCIO, who in turn is
closely associated with SAMMY MARCELLO, CARLOS! youngest
brother. Source advised that NUCCIO drives a dark-colored
Pontiac, and utilized this vehicle to take MARCELLO to the
BOURGEOIS residence. Source advised that when MARCELLO
returned from this meeting, he told the source not. to’ get
involved in the situation, and he himself was not getting
involved, because there were too many people interested in
the situation.
