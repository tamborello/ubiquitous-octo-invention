MESSAGE, TIME HAS NOT YET PERMITTED, SUBSTANTIVE EXAMINATION OF '
‘THIS MATTER’ WITH GENERAL HARKINS. ay GENERAL VIEW IS THAT THE

UNITS, BUT OTHER’ UNITS WILL JOIN THEM. VE, BELIEVE THAT VIETNAM’ s
BEST GENERALS | ARE. INVOLVED ‘IN DIRECTING THIS EFFORT.. IF THEY CAN* tT
PULL IT OFF, IT. IS DOUBTFUL OTHER MILITARY LEADERSHIP COULD DO SO
SUCCESSFULLY. IT Is UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE GENERALS wouLD BE RETICENT |
