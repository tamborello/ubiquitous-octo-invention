LEE HARVEY OSWALD AND WIFE MARINA . * ofA

The source discussed the Lee Harvey OSWALD case with former instructors at the Minsk KGB
Higher School of Counterintelligence.

Foliowing his defection to the USSR, OSWALD was resettled in Minsk, outside of Moscow. He was
placed under full surveillance by the regional or territorial KGB in Minsk. KGB officers from the Second
Directorate of the White Russian KGB were in contact with Oswald and considered him an agent because
he would provide them with some information on his past. Marina was also considered an agent.

Oswald resided very close to Victory Square and the KGB Higher School in Minsk. His apartment
was very nice by Soviet standards.

Oswald was also interrogated several times by KGB officers in Moscow. The source does not
know what type of information OSWALD provided to the KGB in Minsk or Moscow.

OSWALD fell into deep depression in the USSR. He was homesick and wanted to return to the
United States. He eventually received Soviet permission to return to the United States with his wife Marina.

His KGB handlers did consider passing OSWALD to the First Chief Directorate to be handled by a
KGB residency in the United States. This proposal was ultimately rejected, however, because OSWALD
was considered too unstable. According to the source, the KGB did not handle OSWALD in the United
States and had no further contacts with him.

Marina was considered an agent, but she did not like to cooperate with the KGB. She was
interested in OSWALD, but even more interested in getting away from the Soviet Union and poverty.

 

The KGB instructors who told the source about OSWALD were Colone Colonel
and Colonel] These individuals used to be members of the White Russian KGB. SCD
officers and also told him about this operation. The stories
were all consistent. ;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

According to the source, each one of these officers told him that the KGB did not handle Oswald
after his redefection to the United States, and the KGB did not give any tasks to OSWALD. They also said
that the KGB never gave OSWALD a task to kill President Kennedy.

The source said that rumors in the West suggesting the KGB was involved in KENNEDY’s
assassination were absurd. According to the source, the KGB would never risk the scandal of
assassinating a major world leader.

DEBRIEFER’S COMMENTS:

Needless to say, we will go back over his knowledge of OSWALD in an effort to acquire any
additional information.
