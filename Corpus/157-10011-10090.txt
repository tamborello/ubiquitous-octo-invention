The all [ations made by Dick Grego and others connecting
me to the murdor of President Jobn Kennedy are totally without foundatic
They constitute a false and vicious libe-.,

ES These charges are bizarre a '. products of sick minds.
The Political Left has never been able or willing te accept the fact
that Kennedy's assassin was a man of the Left; thus the Leftist
preoccupation with finding an alternate assassin.

Dick Gregory's smear represents the ultimate in slander and
innuendo c#@stomarily characterized as McCarthyism.

The Rockefeller and other investigative committees will
probably examine Gregory's charges ~ as indeed they should. For my
part I would welcome a thorough high-level investigation and a full
airing of all relevant findings. Only if this takes place will I have
any hope of clearing my name and living free from the threats against
my life already made by neurotics.

I was not in Dallas,Texas, on November 22,1963; in fact I
never visited Dallas until eight years later. I did not meet Frank
Sturgis until 1972, nine years after we were allegedly together in
Dallas. I was not in Mexico in 1963, and I did not meet Lee Harvey
Oswald there or at any other place or time. Moreover, I shared the
nation's grief over the murder of our President, These are the facts.

Until authoritative investigative bodies make known thoir
judgment concerning my alleged involvement in the Kennedy murder I
will continue to bring libel actions against any and all parties
who repeat the libel. I must take this course because the libels are
prejudicial to my position before the Court now considering my
Appeal from the Watergate affair. And because the libels threaten my

Mr. Hunt categorically denies that he has been involved in any way what-
soever with the assassination of President Kennedy, Senator Robert
Kennedy, Martin Luther King, or any other person either within or without
the United States. He similarly denies any participation or involvement
whatever in the attempted assassination of Governor Wallace, the
disappearance of Congressman Hale Boggs or the shooting of Senator
Stennis.

He states that in connection with the planning for the Cuban invasion in
1961, he did suggest that Fidel Castro should be assassinated either before
or contemporaneously with that invasion, but his suggestion was not acted
upon or otherwise approved.

Attached are copies of a press statement made by Mr. Hunt in early
February 1975 in Florida, in which he denies the allegations made by

Dick Gregory and others with respect to his involvement in the assassi-
nation of President Kennedy and a letter written to Mr. Hunt by the former

oO family maid, Mary Traynor.

Lisa Hunt confirms her father's account that he was at home with the
family in the afternoon and evening of November 22, 1963. She recalls
that her father assembled the family in front of the television set. He
wanted them all to watch the program because it was.an important
historical matter. They were all shocked about the assassination of
the President.

On November 22, 1963, he and his wife were driving on H Street at about
9th in Washington, D, C,, when he turned the car radio on and learned
that the President had been shot. He and Mrs. Hunt had been shopping
in a Chinese grocery store in that immediate vicinity, immediately prior
to their getting into the car. The Hunts lived at 5215 Balton Road,
Sumner, Maryland. On their way home they drove to the Sidwell Friends
school on upper Wisconsin Avenue and picked up their younger daughter,
Kevan. Kevan told them that Robert and Courtenay Kennedy, children of
Attorney General Robert Kennedy, were students in the same school and
had been picked up by the Secret Service. The children in the school
knew that the President had been shot.

Mr. Hunt states that the following persons are witnesses to the fact that
he was here in Washington, D, C,, at the time the President was shot
in Dallas: :

1. His son, Howard St. John Hunt, then ten years of age.

@ 2. His daughter, Lisa, then twelve years of age.

i
3. His daughter, Kevan, then eleven years of age.

4. The family maid, Mary Trayner, now employed by a family
living at 4806 DeRussey Parkway, Chevy Chase, Maryland,
and whose phone number is 652-2930.

Mr. Hunt believes that he was either taking the day off from work as

a part of annual leave on November 22, 1963, or he may have been
recuperating from a hospitalization for ulcers. He had been hospitalized
at about that period at Sibley Hospital in Washington, D. C,

Mr. Hunt states that he held the following oil company charge account

and credit cards in 1963 and that such accounts may provide corroboration
as to his presence in Washington, D, C., on November 22, 1963:

Esso Oil, Gulf Oil, Texaco Oil, Cities Service Oil, Brooks Brothers
(New York), Garfinkle's, Woodward and Lothrop, Sears Roebuck & Co.,
Hecht Co. He also states that telephone records might be checked with

@ for an airstrike on Cuba which would have destroyed the six cergatnity
t

combat planes that were available to Castro; second, the order &
there be no air cover for the invading brigade. The result was that
the invading force was chopped up while it was still in the water; the
ships carrying the armored vehicles were sunk, as were the supply
ships, and the troops were left abandoned on the shore. The remnant
of the Cuban Air Force was entirely adequate to demolish the invasion
fleet.

 

Hunt concedes that he was bitter about the decisions made by President
Kennedy, but he primarily blames Arthur Schlesinger, Adlai Stevenson
and Robert Kennedy for advising the President to follow the course he
chose. He particularly feels that the Gibans had been recruited with
certain promises and that those promises were withdrawn at the last
minute. Hunt says, in fact, that the decision not to make the airstrike
and not to provide air cover was made after the invasion fleet had arrived
at the point of no return, i.e., when radio communication to the invasion
fleet had already terminated for security reasons.

After the Bay of Pigs disaster, Hunt worked with Allen Dulles until early
1962 at which time Dulles was replaced as DCI. In January 1962, Hunt

Hunt's Whereabouts on November 22, 1963

 

Epes

Hunt states that he had never been in Dallas until 1971, with a possible
exception of a change of planes on his way to Mexico with his family in
1960. He does not recall whether that change of planes took place in
Dallas or in Houston. In any event, he and his family never left the
airport on that occasion.

5G A RTE IN SOR ABD

He has never had any contact, directly or indirectly, with Lee Harvey
Oswald, Jack Ruby or anyone else thought to have been associated with
@ the assassination of the President.

He was never in New Orleans in 1963 and has never had anything whatever
to do with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which he identifies as a
communist organization.

During the period from January 1962 to 1965, he traveled once or twice
per year to India, two or three times per year to Paris, once or twice
per year to London, and, during that period, he traveled two or three
times to Rome. His only domestic travel in 1963 was between Washington
and New York. All travel, whether domestic or international, was in his
own name.

Hunt states that in 1961 he used the pseudonyn| | in

exception of that pseudonym and the pseudonym he used on-the identifi-
cation papers provided him for the Elisberg break in, he has never used
a pseudonym.

The Bay of Pigs Background

 

Hunt states that in 1960 he was assigned to the job of organizing a
"government in exile!’ for Cuba among Cuban exiles in Florida. The

pifa adopted by the National Security Council under President Eisenhower
called for the formation and training of a brigade of Cuban exiles who
would invade Cuba, establish a provisional government, receive recog-
nition by the United States and overthrow the Castro government. The
brigade h-d its own air force and was otherwise fully equipped by the
United States Government, The operation, however, was not supposed

to be one involving United States Government participation. The venture
was to involve training and launching from outside the United States.

In connection with his political activity and the organization of the
government in exile, Hunt went to Mexico in 1960, Shortly thereafter
the Mexican government demanded that they leave and he returned to
the United States. Richard Nixon, then Vice President, was working
closely with the CIA on the project.

When President Kennedy was elected in November 1960, he was briefed
on the project and confirmed the plans, including the plan to provide air
cover to the invading Cuban force. In early 1961, however, the Kennedy
administration decided that the political organization of the Cuban
government in exile would have to be broadened so as to include all
elements of the Cuban society. Even radical leftwingers were to be
included. Hunt was assigned the job of convincing the leaders of the
Cuban community to accept such a broadening of the political structure
of the government in exile. Hunt found this to be an impossible job to
accomplish because the Cubans recruited to make up the invasion force
had been promised that the government in exile would be solidly anti-
Castro and anti-communist. Hunt asked to be relieved of his assignment
because he thought it was an impossible one to achieve and he returned
to Washington to work on propaganda and similar non-political aspects
of the forthcoming invasion.

Within twenty-four hours prior to the time that the Cuban brigade was

to hit the beaches at the Bay of Pigs, President Kennedy made two
critical decisions that affected the final outcome: he cancelled plans
