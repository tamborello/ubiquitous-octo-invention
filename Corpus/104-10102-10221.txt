Fitzgerald assured the DCI that the highest priority had been
assigned to. the above program within SAS.

COMMENT: See the AMTRUNK Operation paper and attached

 

biographic sketch on Tad SZULC, a possible foreign agent.
SZULC claimed to have had direct access to President
Kennedy, Attorney General Kennedy, and McGeorge Bundy on
a continuing basis. concerning Cuban matters since early
1961. If true, that would have placed him in a position
' to be used as a possible channel by which policy infor-
mation on CIA operations and activities conceivably could

have gotten to the Cuban Government or to the Soviets.

Harvey to the DCI, dated 27 November 1962, which outlined
on-going operations and suggested proposals for continuing
activities. Page 12 made clear that an intensive program

would be continued to take advantage of any possible opportunity
to weaken, subvert, or split the regime in any possible fashion,
which was recognized as a long term effort. Page 16, para V. B,
recommended that the plan be discussed with the Special Group
(Augmented). for concurrence.

3. A memorandum to the DCI from Desmond Fitzgerald, undated,
attached to a buckslip dated March 1963, which outlined.a program
to exacerbate and stimulate disaffection in the Cuban Armed
Forces. The DCI had requested that TFW submit a plan to split
the military establishment from the CASTRO/Communist regime
with a view to replacing the existing regime with one acceptable
to the U.S. The CIA proposal was to identify and seek out
disaffected officers and attempt to convince them that their
future lay in disposing of CASTRO and establishing a new govern-
ment which could be returned to the OAS. (This appears to be
the AMTRUNK Operation. See separate memorandum, ) Pages 9 and
10 cite a statement made by President Kennedy in his speech .
at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida on 29 December 1962 [to
the approximately 1,150 Bay of Pigs prisoner returnees.

Kennedy's statement. reportedly had a favorable impact on the Cuban
populace which might. have bothered.CASTRO.] Fitzgerald stated that
CIA would also explore leads to dissident elements in Cuba from
journalists such as Tad SZULC of the New York Times, et al.

One, some, or all of the foregoing individuals

could have reported to the GOC, Agency attempts to

recruit them. Further research is ‘Recessary, and
indeed recommended, to determine whether those who
did agree to cooperate were run back against us.
Knowledge by the GOC of such recruitment attempts
against some of their highest level officials,
together with GOC knowledge of other CIA activities
targetted against Cuba, might have prompted CASTRO
to consider taking retaliatory action. The retalia-
tion concept increases considering the possibility
that Tad SZULC might have been reporting White House _
policy to CASTRO, and the GOC and/or the Soviets all

“along.

Of interest is the fact that on the heels of
the aforementioned recruitment attempts, (between
1960 and 1962, to split the CASTRO regime), came a
request to CIA from the State Department, in early
1963, for an operation to do just that. Proposal
for the operation was made to Mr. Hurwitch by
Tad SZULC. It appears that pressurewas exerted on
CIA to support the activity and it became the AMTRUNK
Operation. (See the separate memorandum on the
AMTRUNK Operation.) In view of SZULC's involvement,
this could have been a political action operation

(by the Soviets/Cubans) against the U.S.G./CIA.

RES oo J

INTERIM WORKING DRAFT 10 February 1977
OPERATIONS TO SPLIT THE CASTRO REGIME

Review of this file leaves no doubt that CIA was. being
pressured by Higher Authority, as far back as early 1962, or
earlier, to come up with an operational plan for actions
against Cuba with the eventual aim of overthrowing the Castro
regime. The following three documents of particular signifi-
cance were surfaced. A Study of the Loci of Power,

March - June 1962, and two policy papers:

1. <A Study of the Loci of Power, March - June 1962, cites
on page 5 the direction in-which Task Force W (TFW) was moving
in efforts to split the regime. CIA had already recruited or

attempted to recruit certain individuals. including the following:

 

a.

 

 

A sustained effort by TFW to recruit, him in Brussels was
unsuccessful. Despite failure, remained in close
and friendly contact with TFW sources.

‘b. Major Rolando CUBELA Secades (201-252234), ex-

4
Ong President of the Federation of University Students, and an

nal
ae M.D. A Mexico City Station dispatch (HMMA-19325 - Att, 2)
ey dated 10 July 1962, cites 11 defections and "recruitments"
a, a :
a of Cuban officials in which Mexico City Station had been

 

involved since about January 1960, and -indicated that
none of the agents was ideal from the standpoint of control.

An unsuccessful "approach" was. made to CUBELA.

COMMENT: CUBELA might have reported the initial
approach in Mexico City to the GOC and consideration
could have been given to running him back against CIA as
a provocation agent. Several incidents tend to illustrate
this view: .

(1) CUBELA reportedly had let it be known for
some time that he wanted to defect. Word of such
inclination could have gotten back to the Goc. Tf it
did, it is unlikely that the GOC would have let him
continue to travel outside of Cuba under those
circumstances. _ .

(2) CUBELA reportedly had all the tools necessary
to carry out an assasSination of CASTRO, and probably
some opportunities, had he really wanted to do so.
Perhaps he was sent by the GOC to confirm whether
the U.S.G./CIA would support executive action - or to
confirm information possibly passed to the GOC/Soviets
by Tad SZULC. (See biographic sketch of SZULC attached
to AMTRUNK Operation report.) CUBELA also wanted to
meet with a high-level policy making official.

(3) CUBELA, following arrest, was given a rela-
tively light sentence, considering. the seriousness of

the. charge. Upon incarceration he reportedly functioned

Aly

as a prison physician, and drove around in a jeep
unescorted. Such treatment by GOC is quite unusual

and, if true, is an indication that he was trusted.-
