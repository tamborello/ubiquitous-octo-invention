On February 14, 1966, PG T-6 advised:

Recently, KELLY MANNARINO called afi indi-
vidual on the telephone and told this individual that
he would give him "the book" for all types of bets,
but this person stated, "What if I don't accept?" |

then I believe you will." It was rumored that this. ~
person thought it over and thereafter took the booking
action. The unknown individual called at the time

In a recent conversation with ANTHONY

"WHITEY" BESASE, LCN member from Toledo, Ohio,
-BESASE stated that TONY DELSANTER, Warren, Ohio,
is a member of the "Cleveland family." BESASE
: also indicated that he has been in frequent con-

Pittsburgh members of La Cosa Nostra; however, in-
formant was unable to ascertain the purpose of these
contacts. .

On February 18, 1966, PG T-1 advised:

4 Recently, SAM MANNARINO stated that while
E he was incarcerated at United.States Penitentiary,
! Lewisburg, Pa., from mid-1964 to mid-1965, a building
7 contractor named (FNU) DALEY had cheated him out of
a substantial amount of money. According to MANNARINO,
his brother, KELLY MANNARINO, and "some friends" had
come to him, upon his release, and suggested the killing
‘of DALEY, but MANNARINO claimed he disuaded them from
this course of action, saying that the risk involvd
was too great for the smll amount of money he had lost.
