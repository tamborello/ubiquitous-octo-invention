It should be noted that although this source _
recognizes that his father has not told him everything
he does feel that with his association since childhood
with the criminal element in Chicago, having served
time in the Illinois State Penitentiary and his continued
close association with the Chicago criminal element, he
would probably have heard of any. such rituals attendant to
membership.

Chicago desires only to point -out that the
operational procedures of this group could very well be
different from those which are known in other cities. It
is not Chicago's intention to take issue with the information
that has been forthcoming from highly reliable sources in
New York and Philadelphia simply to Point « out that this
difference. may exist.

INFORMANTS
Information from highly confidential sources has

been paraphrased in order to afford protection to these
valuable sources.
