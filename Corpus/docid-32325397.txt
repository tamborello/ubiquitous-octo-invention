Labor-Management Relations Act \
Fraud Against the Government

  
  
 
   
   

Bureau investigation into this matter discloses that the
Exhibitors Service Company (Esco) a Class II motor carrier licensed
with the Interstate Commerce Commission, has disbursed checks which
were charged, under ICC regulations to an Account #20, but which,
in fact, were cashed and the proceeds thereof were sent to Edward B.
Weinheimer.

It is the opinion of this Division that if evidence is devel-
- oped to show that the disbursements charged to Account #20 were,

in fact, "payoffs" to "Barney" Baker, organizer for Central States

Conference of Teamsters, then. these facts would constitute a viola-
tion of the Labor-Management Relations Act (29 U.S.C.A. 186).° These
facts may also constitute a violation by Esco of 16 U.S.C.A. ‘1001 in
that Esco filed false reports with the Interstate Commerce Commiss. ae
Venue in the false statement case would, lie in the District of Col ia ig
as ICC regulations require that an annual report be filed with the U6m-

mission in Washington. r

This Division will, therefore, present this matter before a = ~
Grand Jury in the District of Columbia for the purpose of determin=
ing whether Esco has violated 16 U.S.C.A. 1001. If evidence. develops f7¥
any violation of the Labor-Management Relations Act, then this matter \
will be-referred to the United States Attorney, Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-
vahia, for appropriate action. ~ ;

In conjunction with this Grand Jury it is requested that the -
following investigation be conducted: ’

. Sl. Ascertain’ the identity of past employers of Edward F.
. ': Weinheimer in Eistsburgh to determine whether his employers pf
Etat 2 in the Pittsburgh area had any labor difficulties in which :
; Weinheimer interested himself and, if so, the extent and
nature of Weinheiner's participation. In this connection,
refer to the repért lof @péGild} gent Torrens, dated /
December 11, 1958, at aoe » which reflects, in an
interview of Allen Clark, dated December 2, 1958
