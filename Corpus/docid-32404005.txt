Dear Mr. Gunn:

Reference is made to Mr. Marwell's 14 June 1995 letter
to Mr. John Pereira involving a number of documents from FBI
files. Further reference is made to our 10:00 meeting this
morning in ARRB offices during which we discussed in detail
the postponements to these documents the Agency believes are
necessary.

In the 14 June letter, Mr. Marwell advised that the
Agency could provide its response on these documents in any
number of ways, including informal meetings with ARRB staff
members. Please consider our meeting this morning our
response.

Enclosed for your use are copies of each document with
the Agency's proposed postponements high-lighted in yellow.
Please remember that additional FBI postponements are not
high-lighted on these documents.

If you have any questions, please call me (703) 351-

Sincerely,
Barry Harrelson Sy

RE: ARRB Review of Documents from FBI Files, July 17-18, 1995 *

Dear John:

Enclosed is a copy of a letter, dated June 9, from me to Mr. Terry O'Connor of the FBI.
As the June 9 letter states, the ARRB staff intends to present a number of documents
from FBI files to the Review Board, on July 17-18, for decision on claimed
postponements (and “Not Assassination Related" — or "NAR" — determinations) in
those documents. The CIA appears to have equities in information now postponed or
withheld in several of these documents. Documents in which the CIA appears to have
equities are specifically identified on page two of the enclosed June 9 letter, as well as
on the enclosed Request for Evidence forms. ;

Since sending the June 9 letter, the ARRB staff has identified the following additional
document from the FBI files as having CIA equities: HQ 105-82555-2101 (duplicated at
DL 100-10461-4015). This document will also be presented to the Review Board at the
July 17-18 meeting. The appropriate Request for Evidence forms are enclosed for this
document and its duplicates. We understand from our meeting on June 13 that you will
send'members of your staff to the Bureau to review these documents.

As discussed in the June 9 letter, we request that you submit to the ARRB staff by July
10 whatever document-specific evidence or arguments you may wish with regard to

your equities in these documents. Although the enclosed Request for Evidence forms

- suggest that you submit evidence or arguments in writing, we will be happy to discuss
with you other means of presentation that may be more convénient or practicable (e.g,
formal presentations to, or informal meetings with ARRB staff members). :

As always, thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely yours,

David Marwell
