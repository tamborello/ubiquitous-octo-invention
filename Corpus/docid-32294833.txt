Colonel CUMMING also pointed out that the term
"insured" by Lloyds of London is a misnomer as Lloyds do not
pay out claims to individuals but act as a re-insurance
organization for other insurance companies and any money
paid by Lloyds is paid not to the individual policy holders
but to other insurance companies to help them cover their
losses when heavy demands are put upon their resources by
their own policy holders. (3)

No information was obtained indicating subject or
any of his associates had any kind of an insurance policy
other than the fire insurance policy mentioned above and
no information was. available identifying the officers of
the corporation of which subject was a member, @,

As there are no further leads outstanding, this
case is being placed in an RUC status. CO
