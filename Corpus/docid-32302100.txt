ADMINISTRATIVE:

   

Tampa has assumed origin in this matter under the
caption of ANTI-CASTRO GROUP, ORLANDO, FLORIDA,..as it has not
been clearly. established. that this group officially represents
the Second National Front of Escambray (SNFE) (Operation Alpha 66)
on-which Miami is origin. The latter designation. is added to
the title in this report for the.sake of clarification, as’
most of the information dévelopeéd on the Orlando, Fla. » group
appears to pertain to SNFE, Operation Alpha: 66.

operational interest in the project mentioned at Orlando, Fla: ,/
concerning thé T=-6 military type aircraft purchased by. Alpha 66
and its’ plans ,tq ready tis aircraft for possible raids. against
FIDEL CASTRO S)] U

By airtel dated10/1/63, the Miami Division s advised
the Bureau that FAA, Custéms, and the Coast Guard were contacted
relative to the above-mentioned aircraft; the key allegedly being |
used as.a base which has an airstrip, and the two Americans: who
offered their services; all. of which was with negative results.

All sources at Miami were alerted to immediately :
furnish any information bearing. on possible ‘neutrality matters,
| PacTuding’ air. raids or attacks by boat. me

as well as an airstrip, the following is noted.

also. have intermittent patrols. (every> six days in Séeu. of the
above) of other areas of the Bahamas;. including

Afidros Island.
The numerous airstrips throughout the Bahamas are p Spot checked

Ye SNFE formerly litilized. Williams Keys, northwest
of Andros feland, as a base.

There is ‘an airstrip on this key
which the British plowed up in April, 1963, but which. may

now be usable. Coast Guard Intelligence Office, Miami, had
“no information regarding such a base.

On 10/10/63, 50+S furnished the identities of
the. two"Americans' as DONALD IGMAN, of the Seligman Insurance
Agency,, Orlando, Fla., and an individual who uses. the alias
of ACKSON, but who has a completely different true name
fp which is nknown - to the informant. Informant feared some type
v of reprisal if. it were revealed that he had identified these
two individuals. For this reason, Tampa did not deem it
appropriate to disseminate the identity of: the "Americans" at
this time, nor is it, deemed advisable -to approach or interview
either one. Case hig been opened to obtain background through
usual -sources.
