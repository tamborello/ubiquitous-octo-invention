home and abroad, has

‘Manchurian Candidate’

Popkin, a philosophy professor

at Washington University in St. :

Louis, stepped off a plane in the

.Mation's capital lugging a brief. .

‘case containing documents -il-

luminating the strange case of ..
the man who shot a bank. Also.

‘as. But the former intelligence. :
officer had been inacessible. He...

a thick sheat of papers relating
to a bizarre “Manchurian Can-
didate” episode in the Philip-
pines in 1967.

Both the Et Paso and Manila a
‘incidents, Popkin said-in an in- -
terview before leaving for |

Washington, were linked to the
Dallas assassination of John F.

Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. They -

would “crack the case wide

« _ open,” he. predicted.

The slight, bearded academl
cian was stopping in

“Washington to present his .dis- -

coveries. to Attorney. Generai

The Second Oswald -
Popkin is no stranger to the
“JFK investigation. In. 1966 he

which chronicled several in-
stances of someone imper-

sonating the man later accused .

of slaying the president. At the
time the book gained scant

attention, but recently it was dis- |

closed that as early as June 3,
_ 1960, FBI Director J. Edgar
‘Hoover himself .wrote an in-

terdepartmental memorandum |
citing evidence of an- Oswald -.

-letters from prisons: -"-%%°"

formed his CIA superior. but...
feared nothing would be done

imposter. The FBi knew: Oswald oe

at that time as a defector to-~
Russia,-and, some conspiracy
theorists believe, as a possible
CIA agent. .

Popkin said he had been in
touch with Richard Nagell, now

living near San Diego, and had 2: |

_ INATION

(continued from', Le a
Washington about Sept. 26 (as

it turned out, JFK left Sept. 25 .
~ for a whirlwind tour of the West).
‘Frantic, Nagell flew to Havana

on Sept. 19 to see if Casira-

aides could shed light on the
assassination plot, but the only

advice they could offer was to —
execute Oswald In the hope that -
would stop the plan.

- But Nagell left Cuba deciding

- that he “was an_ intelligence

agent, not a killer." Flying to El

“ Paso via Mexico City, he walked -

into the bank the next day for
“the sole purpose of having
myself arrested and detained by

- federal authorities" — ap--

parently- fearing that his
association with Oswald would

implicate himself in the planned .

assassination.
Nagell was in the El Paso Jall
when Kennedy was shot In

- Dailas two months later. He sent

an offer to testify before the
Warren Commission through
“private channels” but received

/ no reply.

Dedicated Leftist
in his recent discussions with
Popkin, Nagell has reveaied

~ new details about Oswald. He

first met Oswald, he said, in the
late fifties at the U.S. naval base
at Atsugl, Japan, where Oswald

was a Marine Corps radar
-_ specialist. They became friends

but didn’t encounter one.

another again until August 1963 .
- when Nagell learned of the plot .

‘against Kennedy.

‘Disputing claims that Oswald
had ties with the CIA, Nagell
belleves that Oswald was a
dedicated leftist who was duped

- by anti-Castro exiles involved in —

" the conspiracy. Posing as
Castro G-2 intelligence agents, -
the exiles wheedied Oswald into -

becoming a “fall guy” by playing

on his Castro sympathies, pain- .
ting Kennedy as anti-Castro and ©

promising that he would be
Spirited to Havana after the
assassination. :

Nageli told Popkin he met
with Oswald both in Mexico City
and New Orleans, hotbeds of
the anti-Castro movement.
“Nagell claims he has squirrel-
ed away a snapshot of himself
with Lee Harvey Oswald taken
in Jackson Square in New
Orleans in 1963," Popkin as-

-serted. “In the picture are two

other men, both anti-Castro
‘Cubans, who were pretending

wee we ee

if this photograph does exist

- H would lend credibility” to

Nagell's account. And Na® is.

‘willing to surface and te... sis
story to Congress, Popkin says,
provided protective conditions
are met.

“Manchurian Candidate”

Pookin is also convinced that -

the Manila “Manchurian Can-
didate” case was connected to
the JFK assassination. On
March 2, 1967, a man named
Luis Angel Castillo was detain-
‘ed by the Philippine National
Bureau of Investigation after he
had contacted left-wing - Huk
guerrillas. Questioned under
_truth serum and hypnosis,

Castillo blurted out a tale of hav-°

ing been taken to a building in
Dallas, Tex., the day Kennedy
was shot. handed a rifle

assembled from components -
hidden in a bowling bag and in- —

Structed to fire at a man in an
open car sitting next to a lady.
The signal to fire would be given
.by mirror flashes.

The story caused a brief sen-
sation at the time. The Manila
Times bannered: “ ‘JFK Plotter’
in Manilail® Wire service dis-
patches to. the United States
‘said Castillo was a “Cuban-
trained Communist agent" who

“hadn't shot because he heard ©
_fthat a man named Joe “had ;

‘already shot. the man in the
“open car." The story was so im-
plausible that it quickly died.

Not long ago the hypnotist
who conducted the interroga-
tion of Casiilio for the Philippine
authorities arrived in this coun-
try under the name Vincente R.
Sanchez. When Popkin tock a
look at his reports, his eyes
popped.

The reports termed Castillo a
“zombie — ai hyp-
noprogrammed robot.

Double-Agent Network

Sanchez extracted Castilio’s
-rambling story over a period of
weeks. Castillo, then 28, was in-
ducted around 1960 into a
“Special Operations Group"
which afforded him paramifitary
training. In 1961 he participated
in the Bay of Pigs invasion, as a
pilot for the CIA. Thereafter he
infiltrated a double-agent

‘network, posing as a Com--

munist in Venezuela and fi-
quidating a Communist agent in
Mexico.

In talking about the JFK
assassination, Castillo —
despite some disjointed
phrases — was nevertheless
able to describe in some detail

Let's get out of here." After the
rifle was disassembled and-

stuffed in the bowling bag, he. a

had brought him to tne building..

in 1967, according to
Sanchez. Castillo was
programmed to assassinate

Philippine President Ferdinand = .

Marcos after openly associating

with the leftist Huks — which 7°.”

 

- would implicate them in the --.
assassination. Popkin points .
out that this is @ similar ploy to | *

'.the ane Nagell attributed to the ~

anti-Castro Cubans’ use of,
Oswald.”

Until recently, the ‘Castitic :

episode might have seamed a-
logcial
release of the Rockefeller
Report, with
about secret CIA projects to in-
duce behavior modification in

unsuspecting subjects, make

the possibility of a “Manchurian —
Candidate” more than mere
fantasy. {in the Robert Kennedy >
assassination, Dr. Bernard Dia-.~

mond, who examined Sirhan
Sirhan for the defense, testified”

that he believed Sirhan was —

hypnotized at the time of the

-shooting.) _
-Although — the ‘current Mls

whereabouts of Castillo is un-
known, the Sanchez reports

contain the names of six per- | ;

sons who supposedly ran his
network, including the “contrai
officer” and a woman who hyp-
notized him. Popkin’s awn in-

vestigations have shown. that...
