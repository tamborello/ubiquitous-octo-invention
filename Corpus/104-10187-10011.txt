During the reporting perlod there have been no known adverse seourity
ineldents affecting lhe LIEMPTY operation. tivatings botween the two cutouts

changed frequently, Meetings between the cutouts and action agents are made

in a similar manner,

   
   
  
 
  
   
  
   
     
  
    
 
  

In order to previde maximum compartmentation between tha various base- ,
houses, Oliver 0, SCANTLING was inserted as the cutout to the LIMITED basehouse
and its basehouse keepers (LIEMPTY- ~6 and LIEMPTY-8) in October 1962, He replaced
Raymond H, GERENDE in this task, . GERENDE continues as eutout for the LIENTRAP |
LICALIA, and LILYRIC phase of LIEMPTY., In addtlion, tnais move makes for better .
rapport between the cutout and LIEMPTY-G, (since LIAMPTY-6 and SCANTLING are.
close in age) and gives GERENDE time to provide more prompt processing of the
raw photo take, (In regard to tnis development, it should be noted that .
GERENDE can now regularly provide finished product within 24 hours - sooner

upon request),
