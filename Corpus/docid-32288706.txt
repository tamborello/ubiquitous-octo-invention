(o} :

whom he is reasonably confident was identified as Mr. WILLIAM
ERICKSON and whom he knows to be the attorney representing
ALDERISIO, MARINO insisted that he had no knowledge as to the
discussion leading to STEIN's request that BISTERFELDT contact
ERICKSON and consequently would have no idea as to what such -
a meeting would accomplish nor did he know whether or not
BISTERFELDT had ever made such a contact.

Mr. MARINO stated that he would make a search of his
personal records in an attempt to determine the exact dates
when §TEIN was in Denver as well as the date that he was in
Chicago and signed the affidavit and the date when he tele-
phonically contacted STEIN and on which occasion STEIN requested
that he contact EGAN and request him to get in touch with :
Attorney ERICKSON and that when this information was located,
he would notify the Denver Office.
