11 November 1975

Bob,

There are, in my mind, two distinct problems which have to be
addressed by the Task Forces These are (a) a final proofing of the
sterile copy of the file, and (b) ensuring that the machine run accurate-
ly reflects what actions were taken with regard to full and partial
declassi fication.

In the case of the final prodfing only one person review the entire
sanitzed fila to ensure consistaney in the released product, eliminate
ay have slipped past,

cunlient2 materials and pick up any. errors “hich

   

i.e. ervrts etc. Thie should not take long, nerhans a day and should
protably dons
The second problem may take more time. It would be the reviewing of
each of the documents indicating whet declassification , if any was done
and accurately reflecting the action on the mactine run. The vould be a
tvo man job. An ettendent protiem would te indicating on the machine run
wrenever duplicates bearing otier numbers ascear in the file. (In seme
cases we have found two, three or more copies of the same donument, bearing
a different number, larded throughout the files.) A tertiary problem is the
marking on the machine run cases of drafts, research notes etc. My re-

commendation for this phase ‘ould be for a person from the Tesk Force,

  

familiar with files and the entire excercise vork jointly with a person

from C/CI/ERO's office,

TO: : Chief, CI
Re your remarks on a report to DDO for DCI and other DD's on the
declassification exercise, it will include the following: -
Nimber of dacuments HH reviewed.
,- Number of documents declassified entirely (including those
with ménor sanitization, such as removal of crypts, slugs, true names, etc.).
& Number of documents partially declassified (portions of text
removed which cannot be released because of substantive content).
Number of documents remaining classified.
Number of ducuments referred to other agencies.
Number of manhours spent on the exercise, with professional and
clerical breakdown (for possible cost estimates in future).

Number of pages of documents copied.

Are there any additional items you wish included?
