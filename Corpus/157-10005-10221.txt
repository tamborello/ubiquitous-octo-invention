S This message would seem to indicate that an assassination plan
may have still been in existence in June of 1961, after the
failure at the Bay of Pigs and of the assassination attempt
discussed above. Apparently the agent NOTLOX was not arrested
in April, since he is still sending messages in June.

9. Cable, dated May 3, 1961, to BELL from (IMRIMM: .
This message transmits another one received from an agent
inside Cuba. The cryptonym of this agent was TEKLOK. The
English translation of the message reads as follows:

“We are contacting all groups (dos) to
organize one united front with a coordina~
tor. You name him or we elect him. Tell

us. Will try kill Fidel today. Andres OK ,
but still hiding. His men gone to hill.

Want know and what can be used. {as revd)
Luis Jorge."

Note that this is a second agent within Cuba to
transmit a message dealing explicitly with the subject of

’ assassination.
™ It should be noted that I did not search the files
ee of the DDO to locate these documents. Rather they were

searched by DDO employees and these documents were compiled
by these employees and given to me through Joe, Seltzer.
Nothing in this package of documents would allow me to deter~
mine the true identities represented by the cryptonyms of the
addressors and addressees of the above messages. Nor is it
possible to identify the agents within Cuba identified by the
above cryptonyms. When I returned these documents to Seltzer,
I requested that he determine the true identities of the
possessors of these cryptonyms and also seek to obtain copies
of any replies the CIA may have sent in response to these
messages coming out of Cuba relating to the assassination of
Fidel.

Subject: DOCUMENTS FROM DPD FILES RELATED TO
CUBAN OPERATIONS DURING THE PERIOD 1959 ~ 1961

Today, May 21, 1975, Joe Seltzer furnished me a
group of documents, totaling about one-quarter inch in thick~
ness, which were compiled by, “Of the DDO. These
are the documents described in paragraphtwo of the May 15,
1975, memorandum from the Agency entitled "AMB Research of DPD
Files Related to Cuban Operations." Paragraph two of this memo
reads: "A number of documents were found that referred to the

a intent on the part of some Cuban teams operating inside Cuba to
attempt to assassinate Castro. . .Also, there is mention of the
( air drop of Springfield rifles with telescopic sights."

 
   

Items of interest in this group of documents
are as follows:

i. Memorandum for the record, unsigned, undated,
Subject: "First Meeting of Branch Four Task Force, 9 March
1960." This memo outlines the meeting of the Branch Four -
Group which apparently was to concern itself with covert .
operations against Cuba. The memo relates that Colonel King
gave a briefing at this meeting, one aspect of which was as
follows: "He said that unless Fidel and Raul Castro and "Che"
Guevara could be eliminated in one package--which is highly
unlikely--this operation can be a long, drawn out affair and
the present government will only be overthrown by the use of
force." There are no other references in this memo to elimina-
tion or assassination of Castro. It appears to be a general
discussion of necessary support for covert operations against
Cuba. ‘ ’

mo + Cable, dated April 4, 1961, to BELL from @Raemme
This cable, written in Spanish, appears to be a request from
an agent within Cuba that certain equipment be air-dropped to
him. Among the items requested in this cable, are one -50~
caliber machine gun, two boxes of Springfields with telescopic
sights, plus other weapons and rockets. :

 

This appears to be another message from an agent within"Cuba.
Written in Spanish, it is translated as follows:

“March 23 I told Luis Bueno to ask you
Opinion regarding sabotage Cia. Electricidad
(electric company) in order to leave Havana =
ten days without power. We can coordinate °
with attempt against Fidel in public appear-
ance (at) Sports Palace. Suggest attempt

‘o against Fidel in accordance with general
plan. Light and Fidel possibly can be
coordinated with Pinar del Rio. Reply urgent.

: 5. Cable, March 29, 1961, from BELL to feu.
(Note that this cable and the preceeding one were also sent
to the DDP as an info copy-] This cable recounts another -
message apparently received from an agent within Cuba. The
agent who sent this message had the cryptonym "NOTLOX." ‘The
English translation of this cable reads as follows:

"Plan (4) 9 April. Fidel will talk at the
palace. Assassination attempt at said place
followed by a general shutting off of main
electric plants in Havana Veladura,. Occupy

the public square, telephone company, atares

This cable,

 

_whose cryptonym was NOTLOX. The English translation of this
message is as follows:

"Your message 15. Brand, Chacho, and Luis
only have arms for 50 men. Blowing up (of)
central electric plant and possibly attempt
on Fidel will be decidedly carried out ;

9 April. Once this (is) achieved impossible
to maintain clandestine organization in Cuha.
Your military aid is decisive. If it does
not come that date we are lost."

7. Cable, dated January 9, 1961, to JMBELL
from Guatemala. This cable reads in part as follows: @

with statement they all Cubans exc
or in Guat with mission assassinat ESVEI

a [There follows a list of eight names. This cable apparently
reflects information received by the CIA that certain people
in Guatemala were targets of Cuban assassination plots. I .
would speculate that the two acronyms ,FESOLEO215 and} ESVEHTCLEWIn
refer to Cuban exile leaders who at hee were ipo emer
in Guatemala for the Bay of Pigs mission.
