Dear Mr. Rust:

Re: U.S..v. Gerald Patrick Hemming
So. Dist. Fla. Case No. 76-6085-Cr-JE

This letter is in response to your letter to the Director, dated.

January 19, 1977, requesting information pursuant to Brady v. Maryland
concerning Mr. Gerald Patrick Hemming's alleged employment with
this Agency.

 

Mr. Hemming has been a voluntary informant for this Agency,
having, on several occasions, voluntarily provided information to the
Agency. An acknowledgment to this effect was provided the Depart-
ment of Justice by this Agency's General Counsel in a letter dated
February 15, 1965.

   

Our records do not reflect that Gerald Patrick Hemming was ever
employed by the Central Intelligence Agency in any capacity, or that he
was ever used as an agent or in similar capacity. Mr. Hemming did
submit an application for employment with the Agency in January 1962.
He was informed in June 1962 that there were no positions available. for
him within the Agency.
