Review of Los Angeles Indices and Files
Regarding Elmer Gerard Pratt

 

On May 2, 1979, a review of the Los Angeles indices
on the name Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt reflected an index
card for case captioned, "Elmer Gerald Pratt, Black Panther
Party (BPP), Los Angeles 157~-3436* (1/69)." This original
index card is dated January, 1969. There are no other
index cards reflecting any main file on Pratt prior to
January, 1969. A second index card dated April, 1969,
corrects the name to "Elmer G. Pratt, BPP" for the same
file, Los Angeles 157-3436. A search of indices reflects
no other reference index cards prior to January, 1969.
The earliest reference index card is also dated January,
1969, for "Elmer Gerard Pratt, Bradford Hall, UCLA,
Negro male, born September 13, 1947," in Los Angeles
157-1618-1373 page four.

A review of the FBI Los Angeles Field Office
file on Elmer Gerard Pratt reflects no FBI investigation
or reference to Pratt prior to January 18, 1969.
The active investigation of Elmer Gerard Pratt
- in main file Los Angeles 157-3436 was opened on January 27,
1969. That specific investigation, focusing on Elmer
Gerard Pratt, was predicated upon information reported to
the Director, FBI by Los Angeles teletype dated January 18,
1969, captioned, "Black Panther Party - Racial Matter"
and located in Los Angeles files at the aforementioned
Los Angeles 157-1618-1373 page four.

.Therein, appears the information that a supervising
officer of the 77th Street Division, Los Angeles Police
Department (PD) advised the Los Angeles FBI on January 18,
1969, that the residence of a deceased BPP member who had
been killed in a shooting on the campus of UCLA by rival
Black Extremist Faction, had been surveilled during the
early hours of January 17, 1969, and a number of individuals
arrested at the residence or in the vicinity of the
residence after leaving or approaching it and had been
charged with Conspiracy to Commit Assault with a Deadly
Weapon, after weapons were found on their persons or in their
presence. Among some 16 individuals arrested was Elmer
Gerard Pratt, Bradford Hall, UCLA, Negro male, date of
birth September 13, 1947. Taken from the residence and
the vehicles driven by the arrested persons were two M-59
Assault Rifles; two .12 gauge shotguns; one 30/30 caliber
vifle; three .45 caliber automatic pistols; two .38
caliber revolvers; two .22 caliber revolvers; one 7.62
millimeter pistol; one 9 millimeter pistol; one telescopic
sight; three gas masks; six gallons of liquid believed to
be flamable; 16 flares; one pipe bomb; ‘two knives; one
hatchet; one machate; one bayonet; two pounds of Dupont
black powder; medical equipment; telephone relay equipment;
instructions for making explosive devices; a large amount
of BPP literature; BPP documents; and a large amount of
ammunition for the above rifles, pistols, and shotguns.

Based on the above articulable facts indicating
those persons arrested may have been planning to undertake
violent acts aimed at the members of a rival Black Extremist
Faction, the main file investigation on Elmer Gerard Pratt
was opened subsequently, on January 27, 1969. It is noted
the murder in Santa Monica, California, for which Pratt
was subsequently convicted, and is presently incarcerated
occurred December 18, 1968.

Congressman McCloskey questioned the veracity of the
Bureau's FOIA response in that the former FBI informant,
Darthard Perry, has come forth with allegations that

he was a paid informant for the FBI reporting on matters
relating to Pratt as early as December, 1968. ~

Senator McCloskey inquired if the Darthard
Perry allegations suggested the following:

1) That Pratt was "framed" on the murder charge
as part of the Bureau's Cointelpro;

2) That the FBI had surveillances on Black Panther
members in December, 1968, which would
confirm Pratt's claim that he was at a
party meeting in Oakland, California, on
the day of the murder;

3) That the FBI conspired in an attempt to
"set up" Pratt by planning an escape by him

in 1974 or 1975.

FBI Headquarters directed the following specific
inquiries be conducted by the FBI, Los Angeles Division:

1) Conduct a careful and thorough review of
field office files to determine if there
is any information therein that would tend
to exonerate Pratt of the murder conviction.

2) Obtain responses from Special Agent William
zy : Otto Heaton with regard to the allegations
of Darthard Maurice Edward Perry in
affidavit of March 3, 1979, and declaration
of February 9, 1978. .

: This investigation is predicated upon. receipt of
FBI Headquarters instructions to initiate an investigation
by search of the Los Angeles FBI Office indices and files
in response to a congressional inguiry by Congressman

Paul N. McCloskey (California) for facts which would

| support or refute allegations regarding misuse of the

| . Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) pertaining to request of

Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt.

Elmer Gerard Pratt was convicted by the Los Angeles
County District Attorney's Office in 1972 for the
December 18, 1968, execution style murder of a 27 year
old young woman on a tennis court in Santa Monica,
California. Her husband, a surviving victim, subsequently
made eyewitness identification of Pratt as the gunman.

Defense Attorneys for Pratt filed FOIA requests
with the FBI. FBI Headquarters, Washington, D. C.
informed attorneys for Pratt that there was no record
prior to January, 1969, in FBI files relating to Pratt.
Attorneys for Pratt contend he was either, or both, a target
of Counterintelligence Program (Cointelpro) or was under
FBI physical surveillance on December 18, 1968, evidence
of which would prove that Pratt was not at the scene of the
murder, or would otherwise exonerate him of the crime.
Attorneys for Pratt have produced for Congressman McCloskey
-a declaration of Darthard Perry, marked as executed at
San Francisco, California, on February 9, 1978; and an
affidavit of Darthard Perry dated March 3, 1979.

This document contains neither recommendations or conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to
