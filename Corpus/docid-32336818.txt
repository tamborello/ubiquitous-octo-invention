MM 105-2102 : SECRET

On September 21, 1960, a controlled source in Cuba
reported that MORGAN talked as though anxious to take part
in a counterrevolution. (This information was also given a
D-6 source evaluation.) (2

The- letter continued:

“Prior to 31 August 1960, MORGAN stated that the

350 to 400 deserters in the Sierra de Santiago, Cuba,
are there due to the anti-Communist sentiment which is
the result of the intense Communist activities in
Las Villas, Camaguey, and Oriente Provinces. The
presenceof these deserters in the Sierra de Santiago

- eaused CASTRO to replace the Regimental Commander in
Trinidad; to recall one thousand militiamen from the
area; and to threaten drastic action if the counter-
revolutionaries do not surrender soon. In the counter-
revolution, the chiefs will be Comandante GUTIERREZ
MENOYO, who has returned from Spain; (FNU) ASCENSIO,
a lawyer; Comandante WILLIAM A. MORGAN; and (FNU)
FLEITES., The planners of the counter-revolution feel
that five thousand deserters will join their group
thirty days after the revolt begins. The revolt will
eventually cause the defection of one-half the CASTRO
army before the beginning of the counter-attack or the -
obtaining of anti-Communist terms with CASTRO. (D-6) 5)

 

"On 9 September 1960, MORGAN stated that
Comandante GUTIERREZ MENOYO has ‘backed out' and has
refused participation in any counter-revolutionary plot.
: He plans to return to Spain at the earliest possible
moment. MORGAN stated that he himself will therefor
\ be the immediate chief of the counter-revolutionary s)

This letter was signed by R. D. ALBRO, Colonel, GS,

This letter advised that a controlled source in Cuba
reported information which he received June 29, 1960 from a
close associate of his in frequent contact with Comandante
WILLIAM A. MORGAN, Director of Restocking Rivers, Cuban Ministry
of Agriculture. The source evaluation shown is that of sub-

source./S

"About 19 June 1960, MORGAN held a meeting
in his home with a group of five persons. Comandante
ELOY GUTIERREZ MENOYO was the only one of the group
identified by name; one other was identified as a
Naval Warrant Officer. The group, described as
members of the “Escambray Group' and said by sub-
source to be pledged against Communism, agreed that
FIDEL CASTRO and his government are Communist. The
group plotted an anti-CASTRO revolt at the meeting
but sub-source reported no firm date for the revolt.
MORGAN said that the time for revolt would be in about
six to twelve weeks and for that reason he refused
an offer from an unidentified Cuban Army Officer of
keys to a warehouse which contains arms, ammunition, .
and trucks. If is not known whether the army officer 4)

"was present at the meeting or whether the offer
had been made at an earlier time. In their planning,
the group discussed guerrilla warfare but in the ~
end favored a plan to attack within the cities and
to seize leaders, armed posts, and communication

" "The ¢controlled source noted at the time

The letter indicated that the following information
was received from the controlled:sawrce in Cuba who had occasional
(|: personal contact with MORGAN. On August 31, 1960, MORGAN
a said that on the day that the counterrevolution begins in
Cuba, he and his wife will travel to the Escambray hills, while
his two infant children, accompanied by MORGAN's wife's
a sister, will seek asylum in tae Latin American Embassy, from
; where they wll seék permission to travel to Toledo, the city of
residence of MORGAN's parents. MORGAN said that_any attempt by
MORGAN to seek asylum or to rebel, would invoke CASTRO'S —
threat against his life, and he added that there were CASTRO
spies within his, MORGAN's, group. (The source evaluation listed
for this was D-6). (3)
