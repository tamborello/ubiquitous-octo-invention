an article indicating that approximately 70 men
of Sturgis' organization were scheduled to make

claimed his organization has 5,000 men of which : :
700 ave in training and that his organization t
includes paratroop groups, underwater demolition sub :
teams, and others in educational activities. ge “4

 

The Department concluded that in light of the
above described activities on the part of the subject,
as well as his past history of extensive revolutionary
activity, it was the opinion of the Internal Security
Division that there is sufficient indication of possible
violations of Title 18, United States Code, Section 960
to warrant investigation.

Bulet dated July 20, 1961, which indicated that the purpose

of this investigation was to determine if the subject had
violated neutrality statutes under our jurisdiction and

the investigation was being conducted at the specific request

character of this case as “Registration Act - Cuba" and should
be corrected to read “Neutrality Matters.”

It is noted that the administrative pages of this
report set forth various reasons why no additional investigation
is being conducted. You have pointed out that the subject
is afforded continuous coverage by MM 639-§ and in the opinion
of the reporting Agent additional investigation would only
result in inconsequential information. You have also pointed
out that past experience has shown that subject has been
evasive and a ilar and since no information of value has been
obtained from him in the past, a current interview would
merely be a waste of time. Bulet dated July 20, 1961,
specifically instructed your office that this investigation
was being conducted at the request of the Department and that
a thorough investigation should be conducted including a
complete and thorough interview of the subject as well as of.
the members of subject’s group. The opinions of the reporting

Reference is made to Bureau letter to Miami dated
July 20, 1961, requesting that sufficient investigation
be conducted to determine whether or not subject's activities |
are in violation of Section 960, Title 18, United States
Code. In view of the results of the investigation set forth (
in the details of this report reflecting cont inuous ;
covérage on this individual by MM 639-S, it is believed a
that additional investigation in this matter would only con
result in inconsequential information. Investigation has }
disclosed that subject is a braggart, liar, and this is . “
borne out by exaggerated statements made by him to ‘
( ‘tthe press. He is nothing more than a publicity seeker: ——
, .and it is not believed that he should be given the dignity
of further investigation at this time. “ld . ;

o The Bureau has requested that subject be
interviewed concerning his recent activities. Past
experience has shown that subject has been evasive, a liar ‘
and will not give any information of value to the
interviewing Agents, and it is, therefore, believed that
this would be nothing more than a waste of time. Further- .
more, since MM 639-S has stated that subject is not
recruiting at the present time, and that his organization,
the International Anti-Communist Brigade, actually is ;
only a "paper" organization and has no members other than
H ' himself; it does not appear that further, investigation '

would be warranted in this matter. wlic)

-. Miami continues to follow the subject's activities
through MM 639-S on a daily basis and it is believed i
that this case should be closed at this time and only be |
reopened at such time as established informants indicate _ i

Me some major threat in the i,
