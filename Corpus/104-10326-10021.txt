3. PRINTING AND PHOTOGRAPHY GROUP RECEIVES DO UNIT CITATION;

IN A CEREMONY HELD ON OCTOBER 2, C/NROC PRESENTED OFSS/ PRINTING
AND PHOTOGRAPHY GROUP (P PG) WITH A MERITORIOUS UNIT CITATION FOR ITS
ASSISTANCE TO THE DO’S CIASO EFFORTS. C/NROC, WHO ORCHESTRATED THE
pO’S CIASO CELEBRATIONS, CITED P PG’S "INCREDIBLE CREATIVITY AND
SUPPORT" TO THE DO DURING ALL OF ITS CIASO EVENTS FROM JANUARY
THROUGH SEPTEMBER, INCLUDING THE BLAIR HOUSE RECEPTION. SHE NOTED "I
AM SURE THAT I SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE DO MANAGEMENT TEAM WHEN I SAY
THAT P PG’S ROLE IN CRAFTING ARTISTIC POSTERS, DEVELOPING CREATIVE
WALL DISPLAYS, ASSISTING IN THE DESIGN AND TIMELY PRINTING OF THE
MANY BROCHURES AND INVITATIONS, AND PROVIDING OUTSTANDING
PHOTOGRAPHIC COVERAGE WAS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF EACH EVENT.
WITHOUT P PG, THE CELEBRATION WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WHAT IT WAS--A
"TRULY CLASS ACT. WE ARE IN AWE OF ALL YOU bo."

 

 

 

DDA DICK CALDER ECHOED HER SENTIMENTS, POINTING OUT THAT "I'VE
HAD BN ENORMOUS POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM CUSTOMERS OF P PG’S CIAS5SO
EFFORTS, WHICH WERE THE RESULT OF AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HOURS AND
WEEKENDS. SUPERB WORK ROUTINELY COMES FROM P PG, WHOSE TEAM MEMBERS
ALWAYS SHOW EXCEPTIONAL COMMITMENT AND QUALITY OF WORK. I JUST WANTED
you TO KNOW HOW PROUD THE ADDA, THE ENTIRE DA, AND I AM OF P PG."

4. UPDATE ON USAA INSURANCE INITIATIVE;

REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AGENCY'S CENTER FOR SUPPORT
COORDINATION (CSC), COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CENTER (CIC), AND OFFICE OF
CENTRAL COVER (OCC) RECENTLY TRAVELED TO SAN ANTONTO, TEXAS TO MEET
WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE US AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION (USAA)
REGARDING POTENTIAL CIA ELIGIBILITY TO OBTAIN USAA PROPERTY AND
CASUALTY INSURANCE.

 

 

 

THE DISCUSSION CENTERED AROUND USAA'S INTERPRETATION OF THEIR
EXISTING BYLAWS TO DETERMINE IF AGENCY EMPLOYEES COULD BE EXTENDED
MEMBERSHIP. USAA’S LEGAL COUNSEL IS ANALYZING ITS CURRENT BYLAWS THAT
PIMIT INSURANCE COVERAGE TO COMMISSIONED OFFICERS. A PROPOSED \

MENDMENT TO THE BYLAWS WOULD EXTEND COVERAGE TO MILITARY
NON -COMMISS [ONED OFFICERS. IF APPROVED, USAA WOULD ALSO EXAMINE THE
LANGUAGE TO DETERMINE IF AGENCY OFFICERS (CURRENTLY DEFINED AS GS-9
AND ABOVE) QUALIFY.

 

USAA MEMBERSHIP WAS EXTENDED TO SPECIAL AGENTS OF THE FEDERAL
SUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (FBI) AND SECRET SERVICE (USSS}) OFFICERS
SECAUSE THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM HOLDING A COMMISSION IN THE MILITARY
RESERVES, RENDERING THEM ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE USAA MEMBERSHIP. BECAUSE
CTA EMPLOYERS MAY JOIN MILITARY RESERVES, THE BYLAWS APPLY TO THE
AGENCY .
