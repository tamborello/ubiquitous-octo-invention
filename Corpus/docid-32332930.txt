Pittsburgh was authorized to install a microphone surveillance om
above-captioned subject by approval of memorandum T. J. McAndrews,
to Mr. Rosen 1-25-61, Because of the technical nature of the installation,
SA B. L. Sutton of the FBI Laboratory was assigned to engineer details: {
A MUTT transmitter, modified on the scene to handle a particular problem, |
was successfully installed over Saturday and Sunday nights, 1-28 and . {
1-29-61.. The signal was picked up at a secure location by a. special
receiver and fed into a.leased line to the office monitoring plant. }

SA Harold L. Williams of Pittsburgh advised 2-2-61, that this ;
' line was. put in on 2-1-61, and a fine signal was received. ‘This morning , 1
the signal appears to be lost. Since technical modifications. were made
- on the scene to the.equipment by SA Sutton and since no access. to the
installation can be made during the week, it is not desirable to send a’
_ Laboratory man other than SA. Sutton to Pittsburgh to assist in this matter.
SA Sutton is presently in New York in regard to another technical matter. ;
His current assignment should not be of long duration; accordingly, when ;
he completes the New York assignment and returns to the Bureau, the can ;
modify another transmitter and be available to assist Pittsburgh further
in this case.

“ec
This program is satisfactory to Pittsburgh and will be'tollowed’

unless advised to the contrary. “
