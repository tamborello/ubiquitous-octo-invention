Dear Mr. Gunn:

(U) In response to your letter of November 28, 1997, we tasked
appropriate elements of the NSA Operations and the NSA Archives elements to
search for information responsive to your questions. In addition, a member of
my staff reviewed our United States Intelligence Board (USIB) and USIB SIGINT
Subcommittee record holdings. The following represents the composite
response of these elements.

448-660) Question #1:_What were NSA targeting priorities and capabilities
against Cuba during the period 1963-1964? Including

records of the ommunications Intelligence (COMINT)-Board, -......

what records does NSA possess on tasking and results from these 44USC2107(5)(9)(2)(D)
capabilities?_In particular, did NSA target communications betwee _

Havana and
Fogarty suggested that the Army-Sectrity ‘Agency had. a pach eae

Mr. (Howard K.? Harold? Johnny?) Johnson, a former NSA employee,

might have more specific knowledge of such an operation and that | you
could contact him.

from August 1993 provides a recap of the USIB SIGINT. Subcommitiee’s Priority

(U) Question #2. What, if any, additional NSA capabilities were added to target
communications sources within Cuba between November 1962 and the end of
1964? What information does NSA have on the targeting of communications
sources within Cuba by CIA? Was there any liaison between NSA and CIA on this
issue? NSA stated that it may have between six and twelve boxes of Cuba-
related material. Of what do these records consist? May the ARRB staff examine .
these records?

(FS-E6O} NSA collectors, based oni their personal recollections, were
alerted to put greater emphasis on Soviet Block and Cuban military targets to
look for signs of increased readiness ‘in their force posture. Analysts at NSA
were also looking for signs of reactions to, and foreign intelligence
reporting on, the assassination. Any voice and cipher traffic was thoroughly
processed from the surrpunding timeframe. Analysts on targets that were

reviewed traffic patterns to
ensure that no deviations indicating unusual activity had been overlooked.

{$-S6O} A review of the United States Intelligence Board (USIB) records
held by NSA shows CIA and NSA top-level Agency cooperation/coordination on
intelligence targeting via the USIB. However, according to recollections of
individuals working at NSA in the mid 1960s, liaison between CIA and NSA for
the 1962-1964 timeframe was limited and no record of CIA/NSA cooperation/
coordination at the working levels of the agencies was located. We searched for
records of CIA targeting of Cuban communications, but no records were located.
However, the USIB records make repeated reference to Committee on Overhead
Reconnaissance (COMOR) Biweekly Report on High-Level Coverage of Cuba with
the caveat that the information was distributed through restricted channels.
Because we do not have copies of the COMOR reports, we are unable to
determine if the tasking of these missions was limited to PHOTINT, or if SIGINT
was also performed from the overhead vehicles. COMOR was the predecessor
of the SIGINT Overhead Reconnaissance Subcommittee (SORS). The SORS
committee is a subcommittee of the current U.S. SIGINT Committee. The
Chairman of the SORS is Mr. John Berwin (phone number: 202-496-9828).
