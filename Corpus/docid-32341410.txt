L,. BEXRESEV, in a top secret lecture to a Soviet Military Intelligence eouree
_ ot Militery-Diplometic Academy, 1960, said, .

"Case officers who use as cover, let us say, the Soviet Trade
Representation, TASS or Sovinfersbure, ean use their cover
assigusents co backstopping fer non-clendestine meetings with
certain agents whose particuler activities officially associate
then with the previously mentioned. Soviet institutions. However,
such nonedlandestine weetings within a legnl residency should be

_ restricted to a minimum both ag to place ond time. Meetings of
this type showld be carried out only io exceptional. cases with

tested end reliahle agents in order to evoid provocation by the

iecel. counterintelligence service against the Soviet installation
being used as cover. Such mectings are held as a rule in the work
offices of the cese officer or of the agent during working hours. — -
It ie necessary that such meetings be conducted naturally, thet

they do not attreet the attention of outsiders, end that the receipt .
and tranenittal of intelligence natiers, properly camouflaged, be
carried out discreetly. In setting up such meetings, measures sgainst
tepping must be teken. One must bear in mind that a meoting with
persons qutside official premises and during non-working hours usually

signifies & relationship between the tuo parties that is above and,

beyond official matters.“

Also, such contact in official installations may be caused by the agent's own
eareleasness, Agein Admiral BEKRENEV speaks:

"Sens agentd, because of inexperience or because of deliberate  ~

_ Violation of the rules of security through peculiar personal

raghness,.... epproaehed our ease officers at plecea not stipulated
es operational meeting sites, others telephoned the case officer at
his Soviet inetalletion and discussed personal contact arrangements,
vhile others still showed up personally at the Soviet installation in
order to contact the case officer.* .

KOSTI Kev, KEB ept. 13 Officar.
i. According to an intercepted phone cali in HSico City, Lee OSWALD

wes at the Soviet Embassy there on 28 Septesber 1963 and spoke with the
Consul, Valeriy Viedimirovich KOSTIROV. This was learned when OSWALD eallea
the Soviet Embassy on 1 October, identifying himself by name and speaking
broken Russian, stating the above and esking the guard who answered the phone
whether there was “anything new concerning the telegren te Washington. *

The guard checked and then told OSWALD thet « request had been sent, but
nothing had as yet been received. (MEXI 6453, 9 October 1963) The FET idedsen
‘officer, Mr. Paphich, teld me on 23 November that the Bureau has reason to |
believe that 's visit was to get Soviet support fer 2 0.8. pessport or
visa matter fperhaps the new passport mentioned in the press articlas/.

  

  

2, EOQSTIROV is an identified KGB officer. He was a case officer in an { {
operation which ia evidently sponsored by the ‘KGB's-13th Department (responaib

for sebotage and assaggination). This operation, which is controlled by the
 FBE under the cryptonym EUEBLEWEED, involved & German-nationel resident of
Oklahoma whe was recruited in Europe, ond met this year with KOSTIKOV, in Mexico

   

13th. - . + 1

3- Of course it is not usual for a ROD agent on a sensitive mission to_
have such overt contact with a Soviet Exbassy. However, we have top secret
Soviet intelligence documents, describing Militery Intelligence doctrine, which
show that very important agents can be met in official installetions using as .
_cover for thelr presence there some sort of open business: Vice Admiral
