which advises that interview reports of Charles Gorman, John J.
Keating, Robert F. McGuinness and Paul J. Rennard cannot be
made available to the attorney in charge of the subject case
for the reason that their statements were made to the Bureau
in strictest confidence. .

V ; Reference is made to your memorandum of July 20, 1959,

It is contemplated that all four of these individuals
will be called as government witnesses in the captioned trial.
Gorman was Director of Public Safety in Buffalo and Keating was
a Representative of the New York State Watch Dog Committee.

~ Together they interviewed defendants Magaddino and LaDuca and
named co-conspirator D'Agostino. The Magaddino interview is
set forth in the indictment as Overt Act 15. McGuinness can

~ give testimony concerning defendant Scalish. Rennard has —

~ information concerning co-conspirators Medico and Bufalino.
As you indicated in your memorandum of July 20, the identity
of these individuals and the information they can give was
secured from sources other than the FBI. ‘

 

Under the Jencks Act it may be necessary for the **= hi G
Government to produce prior statements of these persons wheri*- “eS
they are called as ‘trial witnesses. To protect these witnesses ~ ”

 

it would be most helpful if the prosecution could have the “* - “ °
information they furnished to the Bureau. mee
Therefore, it is requested that you re-contact thesé-
four persons, advise them of the fact that it is planned toz:
call them as government witnesses and see if under these cirdcun- ‘
a ~ stances they will not permit the information they furnished to
vr the Bureau to be transmitted for study by Departmental attorneys
aN 2% in connection with the captioned trial. (f f# |
