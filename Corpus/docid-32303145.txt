able newspaper publicity, that MFROLA realized that the 5
weapons had’been stolen from a National Guard Armory in ||.
Canton, Ohio. MEROLA later learned from a source he could not
recall that the burglary of the armory was committed by

GEORGE FLOREA and RICHARD STEWART, with help from a "inside
man," and that the guns had been stored in the beer distribu-
torship owned by.VIC CARLUCCI in Arnold,. Pa. RED GIORDANO,

. who was convicted in this case merely because it was proven
‘he had bought some burlap bags and the weapons, when found,

had been wrapped in burlap bags, actually had’ nothing to do -
with the case. ANDY MANGINI, who was never brought into the
case, actually helped load and unload the guns from CARLUCCI's _
beer distributorship to the truck and from the truck to the
airplane. . :

friendly when MEROLA was a used car salesman in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
was the one who first introduced MEROLA to the MANNARINOs, in ..
approximately 1954, MARTIN, who now resides in Miami, Florida,

receive $150 per week flat, and those in charge receive the
$150 weekly salary plus a- small percentage of the net take.
It has been curious.in the past .to note that whenever they so
desire, KELLY MANNARINO or SAM MANNARINO would walk into the
“gambling casino and demand that the cashier give them a sum
of money. For instance, SAM MANNARINO might tell the cashier.

Gun-running

Although the Federal Government was not able to prove it,
there is no question that SAMUEL’ MANNARINO was part of the
conspiracy in 1958 to run guns from New Kensington, Pa., to
Cuba. . .

Originally~-the plans to take guns to Cuba were JOSEPH MEROLA's
plang and the guns were scheduled to go to FIDEL CASTRO, In
the summer of 1958, AL ROSS told MEROLA’ that he. could obtain
Ml rifles and carbines. MEROLA met ROSS at the Warwick Hotel,
New York City, and gave ROSS $4,000 as part payment for the
guns, which money MEROLA had received from CARLOS PRIO..
MEROLA was to return to the Warwick Hotel with additional
money in a day or so and did so, but AL ROSS did not show up.
After MEROLA returned to Miami, Florida, MEROLA learned from
Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO, Miami Springs, Florida, that SAM MANNARINO
was interested in purchasing an Apache airplane. Because
MEROLA is a pilot and acquainted with airplanes, he looked
over the prospective plane with Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO and
advised Dr. PESSOLANO that the airplane was too defective.
After that, MEROLA assisted Dr. PESSOLANO to lease a fwin-
Beech airplane from a company owned by HAL DUPONT, Miami, ©
Florida. When Dr. PESSOLANO told MEROLA that MANNARINO intended
to use the airplane to fly guns to Cuban dictator BATISTA, he
realized that these were the guns that had been promised to
him and that he was being double-crossed. MEROLA then arranged
with Dr. PESSOLANO for MEROLA to accompany the pilot, STUART
SUTOR, on the first flight to Pittsburgh, for the sole purpose
of contacting SAM MANNARINO and asking him about the double-
eross. After SUTOR and MEROLA landed at Allegeny Airport,
Pittsburgh, they took a cab to MEROLA's sister's house ‘in the
Regent Square section of Pittsburgh and borrowed her car. |
They drove to the Tour-Tel Motel on U. S. Route 22, Monroeville,
where they registered for the night. MEROLA and SUTOR then
traveled to New Kensington, where MEROLA attempted to locate
SAM MANNARINO, MEROLA was unable to locate SAM MANNARINO, so
he went to Wilmerding, Pa., to the house of "Sarge" BOTTI,
where KELLY MANNARINO was hiding from the service of subpoenas.
KELLY MANNARINO stated that he knew nothing of the plan to
smuggle guns to Cuba, that this was one of SAM ..MANNARINO's
“hare-brained" schemes, and that he wanted nothing to do with
it. MEROLA then returned to Miami, Florida, by way of Fastern
Airlines, It was not until the pilot, STUART SUTOR, was

NORMAN--ROTHMAN has represented the MANNARINOs in their Cuban
and some Florida interests for many years, ROTHMAN, like all
other MANNARINO employees, steals from them, ‘and when. the

MANNARINOs have lost money in an investment, such as the Sans

Souci Gambling Casino, Havana, Cuba, which ROTHMAN fronted for

them, ROTHMAN always emerges with money. ROTHMAN'S Cuban

connections are over-rated and when anything actually difficult

is to be accomplished in Cuba, ROTHMAN ordinarily needs the
assistance of JOSEPH MEROLA, Currently, ROTHMAN has: the
franchise for the cocktail bar in the Bel Aire Hotel, Miami

Beach, Florida, and his two Sons are working at the bar. ROTH-

MAN is, like SAM MANNARINO, an addict to cocaine, which he.

On August 14, 1961, and on August 15, 1961, JOSEPH. RAYMOND
MEROLA, 2018 North Bay Road, Miami Beach, Florida, was inter-
viewed at Room 201, Federal Building, Miami, Florida, by

SA. JOHN S, PORTELLA and SA. THOMAS qG, FORSYTH III in the
presence of U. S. Department of Justice Attorneys WILLIAM
KENNY and WILLIAM KEHOE, who were there at the insistence

of MERCOLA. At the outset, MEROLA stated he would never testify
to any of the information furnished, and he desired his
identity be protected. MEROLA advised as follows:

 

A, PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

Name Change (
No information has ever been received why the MANNARINO family
name was legally changed from RUGGIERO to MANNARINO.

Marriage of GABRIEL MANNARINO

GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO's wife, JEAN, had no choice in her
selection of mate, The marriage was arranged between her
father, FRANK AMATO, of Braddock, Pa., and KELLY MANNARINO,

JOSEPH PETER MANNARINO, aka, JOJO - Brother

JOJO MANNARINO, who suffers from a palsSy-like twitching and ;
from severe stammering, is a "nut" and "con man." He has ‘
dissipated the fortune of his wife, HAZEL, widow of motion
picture actor LEWIS STONE, in just a few years. KELLY and

SAM MANNARINO allow JOJO to come to New Kensington occasionally
on the conditbn that he "stays out of trouble," but JOJO always
does something to get into trouble, such as writing worthless
checks, and is forced to leave town. After such visits to

New Kensington, KELLY and/or SAM MANNARINO ordinarily make
‘good the amount of the worthless checks written by JOJO.

member of the “outfit,” by birth ‘or by being "made." . Whether
‘one is born into eligibility for admission into the "outfit"
or one is made eligible, the only way one can become finally
accepted is by the commission of a murder, Every man who is
considered a “don! without exception, has at some time or
another killéd someone. Once a man becomes a "don," the only
way he can cease being such and can leave the "outfit" is by
his death. The expression is used that "the door opens only
one way." 4

In approximately the middle 1950's, KELLY. MANNARINO took a
great liking to JOSEPH MEROLA and on Several occasions told
friends that he "was making" MEROLA into a "don," On one
occasim, KELLY MANNARINO took MEROLA to New York City with
him where he introduced MEROLA to VITO GENOVESE and MIKE
MIRANDA, at which time KELLY told them he was making MEROLA
into a "don." On another occasion, KELLY MANNARINO gave
MEROLA a pakage and told him to.deliver it to New York City
without opening it, and when JOE MEROLA had delivered. the
package in New York City and it was opened, it was found to
contain only cut up newspaper. MEROLA was put to other tests,
such as arrests by the New Kensington, Pa., Police Department
all of which were designed to test him to see if he could be
trusted and would remain Silent. Because of this experience
with KELLY MANNARINO, MEROLA became aware that all. of the top
leaders, both. Nationally and locally, of racketeering ae of
Italian extraction and are known to each other as "dons."

Some of the "dons" in the Pittsburgh,. Pas; area are:

It is noted that MEROLA was interviewed by Pittsburgh’
SAs. JOHN S. PORTELLA and THOMAS G. FORSYTH III in Miami at
the request of MEROLA, made to Departmental Attorneys

WILLIAM KENNY and WILLIAM KEHOE.

Prior to the commencement of the interview on 8/14/61, DJ
Attorneys KENNY and KEHOE spent approximately ten minutes
alone with MEROLA, after which SAs PORTELLA and FORSYTH
were called into KENNY's office, Room 201, Federal Building,
Miami, Before the beginning of the interview, DJ KENNY
advised SAs PORTELLA and FORSYTH that MEROLA had set the
conditions that the Departmental Attorneys be present;

that he would never testify to any information furnished;
that he requested his identity be protected so that none of
his information ever could be traced back to him;and that
he would not discuss any matter in which he had been a
participant.

After the interview had progressed for some time, MEROLA
relented and told of several matters in which he had
participated.

on 8/15/61, the interview was resumed under the same con-
ditions. At its conclusion, MEROLA advised SAs PORTELLA

and FORSYTH that he intended to be in Pittsburgh, Pa., on
8/24/61, one day before the time he is scheduled to surrender
to the U. S. Marshal, Pittsburgh, to commence service of his
five year sentence in connection with his conviction in the
gun-smuggling case captioned "STUART SUTOR, ETAL; TGP;

ITSP; FFA; NM; CONSPIRACY." MEROLA said he felt certain

that between 8/15/61 and 8/24/61 he would have recalled
additional information of value to the FBI and would be will-
ing to (talk, without:: DJ Attorneys being present. Arrange-
ments for such contact were made, and results will be made
available to the Bureau and interested offices.

For the information of the Bureau, DJ Attorneys KENNY and
KEHOE requested that they receive copies of all the informa-
tion furnished by MEROLA. Attached hereto are copies for
transmittal to the Department of Justice.
