‘The episode of the British ship and sugar shipment ta Pusrio Rico:
illustrates. again the unwisdom of ad hoe procedures for dealing with.
' covert political action matters. The purpose of this memorandum is :
-not so much to protest. that INR,’ which has responsibility in these matters,
was neither consulted nor informed,. but to recommend that Mongoose,.
like all other:covert political action matters, be handled through the .
_méchanism which was: set-up for such | PRuposes in INR/DDC and which |
“Hag operated successfully ‘without either leaks. or mistakes due to. in- .
; adequate staffing for several: ‘years. oe ; : os 4

  
  
 

Tl facts: in this particular. matter have come: to me- >from’ half a a ;
._ Lthink there are’ serious quéstions: about the mérits
_ But ‘my. taajor point is that neither: the. President nor the ~~

 

inadequare 1 Stating, and that this would not have: happened had. Mongoose: :
been handled in the regular highly secure. procedures. ‘followed iby INR/DDC -
_ J rather: than: ‘the ad hee. onés of Mongoose. ;

"matters; second, to Protect security; and, third, to-see'that.all those who
have a legitimate responbibility | ia such a matter also have an opportunity _
‘to: exercise thelr responsibility. The views of: EUR, especially. SOV, © ;
should. have been sought and would have been sought had the matte? ‘been
; haridled. by the regular covert political. action procedures: . ;

- Things like this will contitiue to happen go. loag. as euch delicate:
and-at. the same time involved matters.are handled on an ad hoc bas is,.
and I ‘strongly urge. that. ixuamediate steps. bé-taken to put them back into

: the. special. group procedures where they belong. So
