Work was discontinued at. this point due to _the time element
for security reasons. ( )

On August 6, 1962, re-entry was again made at which
i time holes were drilled utilizing a carbon drilling bit i
with extension. These holes were made between the wall below
the old protector block. This hole is concealed at the

floor between the wall partition dividing the dining room

and the rear store room of the building. It leads to an area
in an open space below the floor. It was determined this Space
is in a sealed basement area under the dining room, Efforts

i were made to snare.the wire drop from this hole through the .
sealed area to a crawl space located in the basement. Work
was discontinued at this point due to the time element for —
security reasons. (U

 

On August 16, 1962, entry was again made and lines
were strung by fishing the "Mite" lines through the sealed i
basement area mentioned above. These lines were strung to the ee
42-A connecting block and strapped down to the yellow and '
| black lines at this point. It was determined that the microphone
; was in satisfactory working order upon completion of the work
at this point and measures of security in secur ing all points
where lines were made. tu .

It is to be noted that the basement area consists

of a portion of the basement which is regular height for
walking and has a concretefloor. This portion is approximately
one-third of the length of the building and is in the south
portion of the building. It is used for storage space. Following
this portion of the basement approximately one-third in length
of the building which is also the middle section of the basement
consists of a crawl space, At the end of this area is a
concrete block partition extending from the floor section into - i
the ground, The north one-third of the basement area is
a sealed portion of concrete block construction. It has a
concrete block wall which extends directly under the wall

This source was temporarily discontinued on
April 19, 1962, after receipt of information from the ;
source on April 18, 1962, reflecting that shortly there~-
after an extensive remodeling job was to be undertaken at
the location of the source, The remodeling process was
undertaken during the latter part of April,1962, and was
completed during late June, 1962. In July, 1962, means of.
re-entry into the location was obtained and on July 10,
1962, an attempt was made for re~-entr however, was not
accomplished due to security reasons. iD

{ On July 12, 1962, during the early morning hours

{ entry was made into the Armory Lounge and a survey was
conducted thereby it was noted that this establishment had

| undergone a complete face lifting and the prior location of

4 the "Mite" unit was now being utilized apparently as a storage .
t area and contained linen shelves, deep freezes, and a walk-in

; meat locker. It was apparent that this room was not to be 7
utilized as in the past as a private dining room as. it was Jobe
: still possible that this room could be utilized for private
discussions. At the north wall of the main dining room it

was noted that a long leatherette covered booth extending

the entire width of the wall was located and several jacks

for extensions were placed along this booth. A telephone

was noted on the booth. A doorway reaching into the storage
area described above is located directly to the rear of this
booth. It was felt that any meetings in the establishment
would now in all’ probability take place in or near the vicinity
of this booth described above, For that reason then, one
"Mite" was installed in the north wall partition, between

this main dining room and back storage room. The "Mite"

unit is directly above the aforementioned booth in the wall
area, The "Mite" lines were concealed under the leatherette
covering which extends along the upper portion of the wall .

in the back storage room. The lines were strapped down in ‘
the old protector block which is located in the same back

room on. the west extension of the wall partition between the

dining room and the storage room underneath the aforementioned
leatherette wall covering. (v)

It was ascertained that during this installation
that the telephone lines previously utilized in this establish-
ment no longer enter into this protector block. A complete
rewiring had been undertaken by the telephone company installer.
An outside survey was conducted of the area where the telephone
drop lines enter the Armory Lounge. Photographs were made
of this area so a close examination could be conducted to
ascertain the exact point of entry of the new lines made by
the telephone installer when rewiring. Work was discontinued,
at this point due to the time element for security reasons. (u)-

On July 24, 1962, an attempt to re-enter the location
of the source was made, however, again numerous top level
hoodlums «i:: .were observed entering and leaving this establish-
ment immediately- prior to and after the time set for re-entry. :
A twenty-four. hour surveillance was conducted on this establish- ae
: ment from July 25 through July 26, 1962, and on July 27, 1962, ue
/ re-entry was made at which time the existing lines were traced -
' sressgy) the building with particular emphasis on the basement

area (4)

 

It is noted that on July 27, 1962, photographs of

! the interior were obtained through utilization of infra-red

. photography. Work was discontinued at this. point due to the
time element for security reasons, d .

On August 1, 1962, re-entry was made at which time
it was determined: the pay telephone service going into the
building had four lines, going from the protector block
located on the west outside wall of the building where the

. drop lines entefed. The private line business phone was
: connected to the protector block with a quad JKT station wire,
and a yellow and black pair was connected to the spare drop
line located inside the protector block. The quad JKT wire
referred to above initially terminated in a 42-A connecting
block located in the kitchen in a baseboard on the north wall,
of the kitchen. A second 42-A block was installed in the
floor joists in the basement directly under the above-mentioned
existing 42-A block. The yellow and black pair.was strapped
down to the new 42-A block in the basement. The quad
station wire continued southward along the floor joists
to a point under the south end of the kitchen where it goes
upward into the wall. At that point it was necessary to_make
arrangements for further entry into the establishnent. //)
