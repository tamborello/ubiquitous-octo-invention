Dear Sir:

i : This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act as
i amended (5 U.S.C. 552). .

I write to request a copy of the CIA letter to the Rocke-
feller Commission dated June 7, 1975.
Senna ene ae aaa een

fo avoid any possible misunderstanding of what is being

requested, I make reference to the Final Report of the Select
: Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to
‘ Intelligence Activities, Book ¥. The Government Printing Of-
: fice date of publication is April 23, 1976..The reference to
the note ig made on page 59, footnote 65. My request includes
any and all attachments of this letter as transmitted to the
Rockefeller Commission By your organization. :

As you know, the amended act provides that if some parts
of a file are exempt from release that * "reasonably segregable"
portions shall be provided. I therefore request that, if you
determine that some portions of the requested document are :
1 exempt, you provide me immediately with a copy of the remain-
i der of the letter. I, of course, reserve my right to appeal
any such decisions. . . : :

i tf you determine that some or all of the letter is exempt
{ from release, I would appreciate your advising me as to which
{ exemptions or exemption you believe covers the material which
| . . you are not releasing. ,
!

My organization is prepared to pay reasonable costs for
locating the requested document and reproducing it.

As you know, the amended act permits you to waive or reduce
the fees {f that "is in the public interest because furnishing
the information can be considered as primarily benefiting the
public.” I believe that this request plainly fits that category |
and ask that you waive any fees.

If you have any questions’ regarding this FOIA request, please
telephone me at the above number.

As provided for in the amended act, I will expect to receive
a reply within ten (10) working days.
