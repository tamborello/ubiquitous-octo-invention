a cee 08 2 reflected that no evidence had
been obtained to discredit or disprove the subject's
testimony or that of his witnesses regarding the statutory
period of three years prior to the filing of the petition
and nothing was contained in the file to prove that he had-
been other than Loyal: subsequent to the date of the filing
ef the petition. Memorandum dated May 26, 1949, by :
eee mae reflected that subject between 1940 and
1942, had been suspected and accused of being both pro .
communist and pro German. Subject had admitted on a few
occasions greeting visitors to his house with the Nazi
and communist salute, but this was only done-as a joke.
He added that he favored no other form of government in
preference to that of the United States and no legal
competent evidence had been secured to prove he was
either pro German oF communist. The examiner recommended
subject's petition be cleared and that-all the facts
be presented to the court. The petition. was approved
May 26, 1949, and forwarded to the Kansas City office.
