FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date of transcription. 8/4 8

tir. HOWARD C. KENNEDY resides at 55 Harneywold Drive,
Ferguson, Missouri 63136, residence telephone number (314)
521-8221.

Mr. KENNEDY is presently self-employed as a private
investigator and polygraph examiner. He retired from FBI
service on February 28, 1977. Prior to his retirement he
was assigned to the St. Louis Division of the FBI from 1954
to the date of his retirement. During 1974 he was assigned
to general criminal matters and worked as a Special Agent
under the supervision of Field Supervisor ROBERT LL. BENDER,

. Mr. REUNEDY's recollection was refreshed regarding an
interview with him at the FBI Office in St. Louis, Missouri,
on July 28, 1978, by SAC ROY B. KLAGER, JR., concerning a
closed St. Louis file 137-16185; more specifically, serial 5
of that file. Mr. KENNEDY recalled having read this serial
in detail, He further recalled earlier discussion on July 28,
1978, concerning a notation appearing on the above serial
which states, "Notify locals of info re killing", and his
earlier reply that in his recollection this comment pertained
to a matter appearing on page 2 of the memorandum and unrelated
to the MARTIN LUTHER KING information.

Me. KENNEDY was asked if he did in fact disseminate the
information in keeping with the above-cited handwritten
notation. He related that he recalls with reasonable certainty
that he did disseminate the information appearing on page 2
to someone in the St. Louis Police Department whose identity
he does not now recall.

Mr. KENNEDY called further attention to the last paragraph
of page 3 of the memorandum in question which refers to another
killing, unrelated to the MARTIN LUTHER KING matter. Ie
volunteered that this additional unrelated information was also
disseminated, to the best of his recollection, to the St. Louis
Police Department; however, he similarly does not recall to
whom this information was given. Was) Sy,

FILE (62-5097) 8/4/78
SAC ROY B. KLAGER, dR.
HSCA

Attention is directed to two FD-302s in this file,
reflecting interviews conducted on 7/28/78 and 8/4/78,
respectively, by me, of former SA HOWARD C. KENNEDY.
Particular attention is directed to the interview with
KENNEDY on 8/4/78 as it pertains to dissemination of
information by him, which information is reflected in
serial 5 of St. Louis file 137-16185. In this interview
of 8/4/73, KENNEDY stated that he recalls with reasonable
certainty that certain information was disscaminated by him
to the St. Louis Police Department.

In order to document such dissemination, this is to
record that I personally searched our dissemination control
file, 66-2340, for the months of April through July of 1974
and found no record of such dissemination having been made.

It should be noted that the volume of 66~2340 for the
month of March, 1974, and prior months are no Longer maintained
as they have been destroyed under the file destruction program.

There is no FD-159 (dissemination form) concerning this
matter contained in 137-16185 or the related file 87-21859.
