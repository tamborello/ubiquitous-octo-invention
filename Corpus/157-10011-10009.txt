OCCURRENCE:

=" with regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.
1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on
this operation since early October was patently false. Specific references made to the
pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he
used as a basis for memorandtm dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to
a telephonic~conversation-on—the-evening-of-30Oct.—1962_between_Lansdale and@neevcas

   

  

 

 

 

 

  
 

which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.

I have discussed this matter in detail with€@emem and clearly recollects that his

conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.

During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brict

discussion of the COBRA GEEAGERAy teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to (Gees

recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which
SOURCE: WOUIT Tesically Nave led to the discussions he TIME Sp APPS

get rid of Castro or the Castro regime in Cuba; lets put it that way, and no
Limitations were placed on the means. In fact, I never recal having been told by

tbove statements refer to_Mongoose.) tlelms testified that "the pressure was very

“very mitty schemes." (26) Helins testified the pressure built up te the Bay of Pig:
