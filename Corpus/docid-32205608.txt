_ JACOBS performed no travel in any countries other than Poland
or Russia during this trip. His only contacts with persons other
than official counterparts involved a brief visit in Prague with
friends of his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Alois KRUSINOVA. Mrs. (Eva) KRUSINOVA
is secretary to a professor who is head of the English Department at
the Universtiy of Prague. With the exception of bringing Mrs. KRUSINOVA's
teenage son two paifs of blue jeans, JACOBS did not give or receive any
gifts of a personal nature. JACOBS noted that blue jeans are very much
the "in thing” in the Communist bloc countries at this particular time.

JACOBS informed that he took a number of photographs during his
trip but he was extremely careful of all of his subjects and background
material. He had no difficulty or problems concerning his photography.
JACOBS has no knowledge of any serious misconduct on the part of other
Americans that might make them vulnerable in any way, nor was he aware
of any Poles or Communists having contact with any Americans. He was
not contacted by any other U.S. Government Agencies in connection with
his trip.

Prior to terminating the interview, Mr. JACOBS advised that since
early 1960 he has been undergoing psychoanalysis in an effort to reduce
nervous tension and to live more happily and productively. He averages
about four visits a week with his psychoanalyst, whom he identified as
Dr. Edward J. MORTELL, 1904 R Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Mr. JACOBS
explained that in 1959 and 1960, he had many pressures exerted upon him
through his job and he was beset with many anxieties. He realized he had
a problem and, therefore, he spoke with Dr. Alex HALPRIN, a neighbor who is
a practicing psychiatrist. In view of Mr. JACOB's financial responsi-
bilities, Dr. HALPRIN suggested he undertake treatment under a clinic
arrangement... JACOBS remarked that several members of his family also
underwent analysis and he commented that his is now the happiest family
on the block. He feels that this treatment has been. very productive
and rewarding for him and he is able to view the world and his responsi-
bilities in their proper perspective. He advised he is still undergoing
analysis and he does not currently foresee any termination date. He
added, however, that he does not now feel his visits are a necessity,
rather, at this time they are an extravagance. He averred that the
financial aspect of all this treatment has been difficult but added that
never in his life has he had any charge accounts and the only outstanding
debt is his mortgage and his payments are current.

Reference was made to the visit of Mrs. Marina OSWALD, widow of
Lee Harvey OSWALD, alleged assasin of President KENNEDY, with the
JACOBS family. JACOBS asserted that since Mrs. OSWALD's completely
unexpected visit at his home in the winter of 1964, neither he nor
his wife has seen or heard from her.

Mr. JACOBS had no knowledge of his name ever having been entered
into the Congressional Record, He has not communicated with any
congressman or senator concerning the conduct of the Vietnam war or
the administration's policies in Vietnam. He has never been connected
in any way with the National Council of Arts, Sediences and Professions,
and, in fact, had not even heard of that organization. The last time

' JACOBS had any contact with Robert W. RUSHMORE was approximately five
or six years ago when RUSHMORE visited JACOBS' family and introduced
his new wife to them. Mr. JACOBS concluded by stating that there is
nothing in his background that could cause embarrassment to the Agency
or that could be used as a means to coerce or blackmail him.

Initially, Mr. JACOBS expressed reservations in furnishing a release
for record information. However, on December 8, 1967, he furnished a

letter in which he gave his permission for his analyst to be interviewed.
Mr. JACOB's letter has been made an enclosure to this report.

: He furnished the following information with respect to his official

a travel to Russia and Poland as Editor of the magazine, America Illustrated.
JACOBS explained the purpose of his trip was to orient himself to those
countries and to check on distribution of the magazine. He. traveled alone,
departing from Dullas International Airport. He arrived in Moscow on
September 5, and remained ther e until about September 8, when he continued
on to Kharkov. He remained at Kharkov until approximately September 12,
when he départed for Yalta, via Semferopal. On approximately September 14,
he departed for Mineralni Vodi, in the Caucasus. He then traveled to
Moscow on September 16, where he remained until approximately September 18,
at which time he departed for a week-end visit to Warsaw. While at
Warsaw, he took a side trip to Wroclaw, returning to Warsaw on the 23rd
of September. On September 25 he traveled to Prague for a two day visit
and on September 27 he departed for London and his return trip to Washington.

Mr. JACOBS' official contacts with persons in the Soviet Union were
confined to representatives of Soyuzpechat, the news distribution service
in Russia. He talked also with officials of Novsti, which JACOBS explained
was, in Moscow, the equivalent of the AP or UPI. His official contacts
in Poland were with members of Ruch, the news distribution service of
that country.

At his insistence, JACOBS was permitted to visit a collective farm

-in Russia. At first, his request was denied, however, due to his
persistence, this tour eventually materialized and was set up for him

by Novsti. JACOBS explained that he was met by a guide at Mineralni

Vodi and the two of them traveled by automobile to the farm. He noted this
was a six thousand acre farm with six thousand people assigned to work there.
JACOBS recalled that a few weeks ago, an American Army Attache and a
British Army Attache were reported to have been drugged and mistreated

by Soviet Officials at a collective farm in Russia. JACOBS noted that in
his own tour of the collective farm and in the tour by the Army Attaches,
the farms had wineries as part of their operation. JACOBS went on to

say that although he was not subjected to provocation and nothing untoward
occurred in his case, he could appreciate how the Attaches could have

been duped into a compromising situation. JACOBS related that during

the afternoon of his tour of this farm, the Russians persistantly offered
him samples of various vintages of wine. After touring the wine cellars,

JACOBS attended

JACOBS attended a banquet where much food and more drink were served.

The Employee advised that he has a liver condition which precludes him
from using any alcoholic beverage and, therefore, he encountered’ no
problem. He asserted, however, that the Russians were most insistent
that he drink the wine and he viewed the entire arrangement as a perfect
set-up for compromise. JACOBS noted that this information could serve
as a warning to future travelers and might very well be an explanation
as to what happened to the two Attaches above mentioned. JACOBS complained
to his guide that he thought it was in extremely bad taste on the part
of the Russian host. According to JACOBS, his guide agreed with him

but commented he was, "under instructions" and could do nothing about it.
JACOBS believed the guide was very naive and gave as an example the fact
that he showed JACOBS the planned itinerary for the tour, something

that is never done by knowledgable tour guides in the USSR.

JACOBS advised that at no time was he ever arrested or detained by
the police, nor did he experience any personal difficulty with authorities
of the host government, other than as noted above. He had no contacts
with any persons whom he knew or suspected of being intelligence operatives,
not withstanding the fact that when traveling in those countries he had the
"feeling" of being followed. He had no reason to believe he was a traget
for attempts at penetration or compromise.

JACOBS engaged in no illegal activities or transactions and has
no outside business activities and/or investments in a foreign country.

; JACOBS, as Editor of America Tllustrated, was the recipient of
gifts of books from Soviet Life editors and a book and a record from his
Polish counterpart. In return, he gave to those people several books
that are maintained in the USIA library, but which were completely non-
political in nature.

At no time was JACOBS the victim of any attempts at blackmail,
coercion or extortion. He is not engaged in any questionable activities
or behavior which might prove embarrassing. He developed no association
with anyone that might reflect adversely upon him.
