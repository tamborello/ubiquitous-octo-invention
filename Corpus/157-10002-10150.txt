Mr. Wallach. I note your attorney is taking notes. May

Mr. Debelius. If they will be provided to the CIA it
wouldn't be by me, Mr. Wallach. Really, I am doing it here
to organize my own thoughts. And I would be happy to destroy
them in your presence.

Mr. Wallach. I have absolutely no problem. I was just
wondering if you were going under instructions.

Mr. Debelius. Could we go off the record just a moment?

Mr. Wallach. Surely. ‘

Mr. Wallach. Do you recall anybody else] | that
the Agency had contact with on a regular basis?

Mr. Wallach. Did you know whether or not the Postmaster
General, the then Postmaster General, I am not sure who it
was in 1964, July, whoever it.was in that position, had
knowledge of the fact that mail was opened in New York City?

Mr. Osborn. To the best of my recollection, I never heard
that he was.

Mr. Wallach. Had you ever heard either way about the
Attorney General, be it Robert Xennedy or any of his
predecessors?

Mr. Osborn. Not. to the best of my recollection.

Mr. Wallach. When you visited New York on this inspection
trip that you described being possibly with Mr. White, do you

recall whether or not Mr. Rabrimd accompanied you out to the
facility?

Mr. Osborn. I can't recall specifically, but I am sure

that he did.

Mr. Wallach. Have you heard of any arrangements whereby

the German authorities actually provide the mail?

Mr. Osborn. I can't recall that, honestly. I may have,
but I can't recall it specifically.

Mr. Wallach. In other words, would it be fair to say that
you are not familiar with that operation?

Mr. Osborn. I am not familiar at all with it.

Mr. Wallach. As I stated before, we have some documents
here, and there are a couple that I think are relevant. And I
would like you to review them later, but I want to get your
State of recollection now. I realize that it is based on
memory of events years ago, and things you read in the paper.
And in no way am I questioning the truth of your memory.

Mr. Osborn. I understand.

Mr. Wallach. Could you just give us an overview

of your understanding as to how the -- we will call it the

 

New York intercept, @ DONA: GF HT LINGUAL, whichever name
you want to use, developed in the fifties?

Mr. Osborn. I have no specific knowledge of this. It is
a little unusual, but even considering that this is one of the
things, of course, that we reported to Director Schlesinger,
I don't believe we reported this in any detail as to how it

started, because I am not really sure that any of us knew.

I don't recall exactly how it did start. But it was alsways

A)

 

Mr. Wallach. And Counsel, would you just state your name.

Mr. Debelius. The name is John W. Debelius, 570 North
Frederick Avenue, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

Mr. Wallac h. Once again, Mr. Osborn, as the Senator told
you, and as you have been told before, you do have the full
spectrum of rights available to you here that you have under

the Constitution, and in particular you do have the right to

 

remain silent if you choose to as to any particular question.
And in addition, you have the right to request that a Senator
be present if you desire that one be here.

Mr. Osborn. Yes. .

Mr. Wallach. ‘Very briefly, before Mr. Rhea begins his
questions, I would like to ask if Mr. Debelius is here as your
personal counsel today?

Mr. Osborn. ‘That is right.

Mr. Debelius' representation for you?

Mr. Osborn. I take it, then that the CIA in no way secured!

 

 

 

Mr. Osborn. I wish they were paying him, but they are not.
I am.
Mr. Wallach. I will ask Mr. Rhea to begin his segment of

the examination.

Mr. Osborn. Not to the best of my recollection.

Mr. Rhea. That is all I have. Thank you very much.

(Off the record discussion.)

Mr. Wallach. Mr. Osborn, if you would, just very briefly,
on the subject matter that I am going to be directing your
attention to, the mail programs, the various mail programs that
you may have had knowledge of while you were with the CIA, I
would like to have you very briefly trace your career for us
in briefest terms with the Agency.

Mr. Osborn. All right.

fa
I jointed the Agency on 10 October 1974,

 

I worked in what was then known as the Office of Collection
and Dissemination, which concerned itself largely with the
collection of any information that had any foreign intelligence
import from other Government departments and agencies such as
the Department of Commerce, the Department of Interior, the
Department of the Treasury, and so forth. It was essentially
a liaison job.

I served there about a year and a half, and I then jointed
the Contact Division of the Office of Operations, which was
concerned with the selection of foreign intelligence information

from American businessmen and private organizations who had

 

business abroad.
I served there until roughly 1950, when I jointed the.

Office of Special Operations tnuuoms

This division, as I recall, was the Plans Staff of the
Foreign Intelligence Division of the Clandestine Services which
is known as the Deputy Director of Plans, DDP.

I was promoted from that position to be Chief of the Plans
Staff. I served there until 1955, roughly 1955, when I became
Assistant to the Inspector General of the Agency.

I served there until 19 -- correction. I think I joined

the Inspector General's staff in 1954, and I left there in late

 

1955 to go abroad in the position of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

After three years in that position I served brifely for

 

six months as

And then 11 months as

I left there in September 1960 to take the position of

 

 

Deputy Chief of the Soviet Russian Division in the Clandestine

Services of the Agency in Washington. I served in that

position for about a year and a half, and then became Chief of

the Soviet Russian Division. And I held that position until

Septemb er of 1963, when I accepted the position of Deputy

Director of the Office of Security of: the Agency.
