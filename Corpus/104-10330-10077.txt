Executive Director

Review Board

Dear David:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 3 January 1997 to the
Director of Central Intelligence concerning the Assassination
Records Review Board's recent formal determinations with respect
to CIA Records.

The appropriate Agency components have again reviewed the
documents that the. Board has decided to release either totally or
with some information postponed. While the Agency does not plan
to appeal to the President for additional postponements at this
time, we ask that the Board reconsider its decisions with respect
to six documents. These documents contain information relating to
foreign government provided data, foreign liaison relationships,
and intelligence sources--information that we believe merits
protection under current standards set by the Board. A list of
these six documents, together with Agency comments concerning
them, is enclosed. :

We plan no further action on these documents pending
discussion with your staff and review by the Board.
