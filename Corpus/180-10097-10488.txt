RE: DEA Files on Bernardo de Torres

On May 4, 1978 at 10:35 p.m. I visited Dave Melocik
and Louis Backrack at the Drug Enforcement Administration
and saw Bernardo de Torres' files. The file is not complete.
His CI application forms are missing; only the FBI fingerprints
are included. Follow-up on 75 plan is not in the file.

Nonetheless, attached are notes on Bernardo de Torres
and a friend (MMM who informed on him.

Should be read carefully!

BNDD notes viewed at the CIA were also not in the file
at DEA. Need them soon!

Recommended follow-up: speak to S/A Joe Doredanttabout
incomplete file or lack of follow-up. Set up a meeting with
CIA and DEA re De Torres. .
