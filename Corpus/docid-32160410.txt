politicians of the 2lth Ward, the ame voting residence of RUBY.
PC advised that he talked to two persons who appeared to know RUBY.
from many years ago. They advised that RUBY was never anything but
“a punk” and never had any hoodlum connections or associations. One
person advised that he recalls thet RUBY attempted to sneak into a
prize fight in Chicago, believed to be the second DEMPSEY - TUNNEY .
fight, and was caught by a police officer who beat him over the head
with his night stick. As a result of this beating, RUBY now has a. Coe .
plate in his head. Apparently this causes pressure when RUBY becomes . Ce \
excited and causes RUBY to act emotionally. -
