92-792-9-2 continued

issuance of a Teamsters charter to LOU LASKY, a New York labor
racketeering figure, for the organization of a New Jersey
factory but he had directed ANTHONY PROVENZANO, the President
of the Joint Council to issue the charter for that one specific
factory. It appears that CATENA holds the right of approval

of a charter to himself but once that is granted leaves the
details of the organization to a selected subordinates and to
ANTHONY PROVENZANO.

On May 7, 1962, NK 2323-C advised that he had
heard that ANTHONY PROVENZANO, President of Local 560, IBT, had
been the individual who had made the sum of $180,000 available
to (FNU) SILVESTRI, owner of Cabana Club and Palma Room, North
Bergen, New Jersey, which was paid to HAROLD KONIGSBERG, a
Hudson County hoodlum, to settle a debt of long standing.

Informant stated that SILVESTRI had been unable
to come up with the money, the operation of the Cabana Club
and the Palma Room would have been taken over by HAROLD
KONIGSBERG. After payment had been made, KONIGSBERG was given
to understand that he should make no further efforts to take
over this property or he would incur trouble from PROVENZANO'Ss
"goons", . ,

On May 25, 1962, a 2
advised (agent not indicated) that one 5! M ) (apparently

formerly associated with Banking and Insurance Commission of

.New York City and is an attorney with offices located in

New York City) had approached the Hudson County Trustees of

Local 560 Welfare Fund early May, 1962, to inform that group

that he was in a position tozplace the welfare money in secure
real estate values having a minimum return of six per cent.

It appeared that COSMAN has obviously received the recommendation
of ANTHONY PROVENZANO to approach’. the trustees in regard to
placement of welfare funds.

As of May 25, 1962, no action has been taken by
the Hudson County Board of Trustees to place any monies with
COSMAN.
