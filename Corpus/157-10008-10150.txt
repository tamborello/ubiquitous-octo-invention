36. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 4 March 1965.

© Chase recommend# phasing out support to Artime. The CIA is consider-
ing diluting pesticides sent to Cuba; this is similar to the kinds of tactics
mentioned in Items 28 and. 29 above and :re a manifestation of the moral
bankruptcy of U.S. palicy. Also some t:ik here of backing a new exile
group, RECE, though not much enthusiasm for the idea from anyone apparently.
Oddly, CIA wishes to drop its paramilit: ry capability, while DoD and State
want the capability maintained.

 

37. Memo, Grant Hilliker (State) to Burdy, 18 June 1965.

This is a summary of U.S. policy tcward Cuba. The ultimate objective

 

is still to replace the Castro regime. The memo notes that "the paramilitary Pte
program involving CIA-controlled actions was set aside even before it really
started.” . :

38. Memo, Bundy to LBJ, 26 June 1965.

Adm. Raborn recommends reactivatior of a paramilitary effort against
Cuba. Bundy, Tommy Thompson, Rusk, McNemara, and Cy Vance are against this ~
chiefly because of the concomitant international noise level. "Most of us," Bundy
writes, "do not recommend visible violent actions against Cuba." Raborn's
recommendations said nothing about assassination.

 

@ 39. Memo, Rostow to LBJ, 30 May 1966.

Rostow notifies the President that a CIA exfiltration mission ran into
ambush and the agents were captured. Th2 President could expect "the noise
level of Castro's charges of ‘threatened Yankee aggression’ may go up."

40. Memo, Karamessines, DDP, to Rostow, 7 August 1967.
This memo is important because it lists the names of two or three Cubans

who worked on CIA missions. If they are in the U.S., it may be worthwhile
talking to them about their activities.

29. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 12 November 1964, and attachment (apparently
€ a Bundy memo for a meeting with LBJ on 7 April 1964).

The Bundy memo suggests that LBJ approved various options "short of
war to get rid of the, Castro regime," including the possible contamination
of sensitive Cuban imports (not food). The Chase memo indicates that a
Fitzgerald operation was underway in November 1964 to ship contaminating
elements into Cuba.

31. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 5 January 1965.

Chase reports a plan told to Crimmiis and the CIA about an Artime plot
to stage a "palace coup" during which Castro and other top leaders would be
"neutralized." D-Day was to be March 13. This matter was to be discussed
at an upcoming Special Group meeting on whether or not "to cut off Artime's
water." Chase notes: "CIA at this point is loath to make a hard evaluation -
of the Artime/Cubela plot."

Plans for a meeting regarding Cuban policy. John Crimmins will
present several options for discussion. including unleashing of Cuban.
exiles and the intensification of the «overt program.

6. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 2 December 1‘ 63.

This memo is mainly important becaise it reveals who in the Admin-
istration was dealing with Cuban polic).. The list of people to attend
the meeting on Cuba held this day inclided: Lyndon B. Johnson, Rusk, —
Ed Martin, McNamara, McCone, Helms or les Fitzgerald, Don Wilson, Bundy,
and Chase.

7. Memo, Bundy to Lyndon B. Johnson, 12 December 1963.

garding Cuba: "...say...that you expect to take every available means
to stop and turn back the spread of Conmunism in this hemisphere."

9. Chase minutes on meeting with Lyndon B. Johnson, 27 December 1963.

The meeting appears to be the first major briefing for the new Presi-
dent on Cuba. Desmond Fitzgerald did most of the briefing, which in-
cluded a detailed description of CIA assets in Cuba, Proposed sabotage plans,
and attempts by the CIA to stimulate an internal coup which would
dislodge Castro. The CIA was aiding tw> exile groups in particular:
one led by Manuel Artime, the other by fanolo Ray. Bundy recommends

that-Lyndon B. Johns “a more vigorous line /toward Cuba/ than
we have in the past."}

   

“B. Johnson, 9 January 1964. “clay
; Bundy recommends a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle of
covert sabotage against Cuba. He notes that Rusk and McNamare do not
support the program of sabotage, while ‘McCone and the CIA are for it,
and so are most of the middle-level officers dealings with the Castro
problem.” Bundy concludes: "...4n.your position, I would stop sabotage

attacks on the ground that they are ill:gal, ineffective, and damaging
to our broader policy."

This memo suggests that a primary goai of the Johnson Administration was
"to keep the lid on Cuba" until after the November Presidential elections.
Thus, the continued exile raids were view:d negatively since they increased
the noise level. The memo makes it clear that the exile raids were becoming
completely beyond U.S. control despite CL\ financial support to the groups.

 

20. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 2 June 1964.

Chase notes that Castro has executed -hree anti-Castro Cubans and jailed .
two others as CIA agents. CIA admits hav ng a connection with the executed -
Cubans "but that it is completely deniabl:."

© Z1. Memo, Helms, DDP, to DCI, 10 June 196. Subject: "Plans of Cuban
Exiles to Assassinate Selected Cuban Gove: nment Leaders"

‘The CIA was made aware of certain plaus to kill Castro. The Agency told L ;
the sources, according to Helms, that "th: United States Government would not, a
under any circumstances, condone the plamied actions." Apparently on 2 March a
1964 a wealthy Cuban exile was approached with a Cosa Nostra offer to assassinate
Castro for $150,000. The wealthy exile turned down the offer. Similar offers t
were make to other Cuban exiles in early larch. A leading figure in the a
negotiations was a shippinu-businessmen from Ft. Lauderdale.

An agreement was finally made to pay 00,000 for killing . .
Castro, plus $2,500 for expenses. a wealthy Cuban aa
exile in New York was to much of thé jioney, an pay the $2,500 on

“John's own inclination is that the U.S. Government cannot knowingly permit
criminal American involvement in this sort of thing, " notes Chase,
“and should go all out to stop the plot." In marginal notations, Bundy
agrees with John and with the need to forvard the matter to the Special
Group.

23. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 16 June 1964, w.th attachment (Des FitzGerald's
"A Reappraisal of Autonomous Operations")

FitzGerald makes a defense of the autonomous operations. Tom Mann and
Chase disapprove of the operations, thougi for different reasons.

24. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 18 June 1964.

Chase warns that further U.S. support of the autonomous groups is more
likely to lead to a U-2 shootdown and a Ciribbean crisis than the overthrow
of the Castro regime. Chase continues to be worried about noice levels
and the November election. This memo is ery much like his 14 May memo
{see Item 19). ;

25. Memo for the Record, Peter Jessup, 22 June 1964.

@ In a reference to Helm's memo on assa;sination (see Item 21), it was
pointed out in a 303 Committee meeting of 18 June that "these reports, in
effect, put the United States Government on notice that failure to take
preventive action could be construed as condonation. " The AG said Justice
would look into the matter. . ;

26. Memo, McCone to Bundy, 19 August 1964.

McCone summarizes the FBI investigation of Cuban exile plots against
Castro as outlined in Heim's memo of 19 Jime (See Item 21). The Bureau
interviewed many people allegedly invo ved, most of whom denied the existence

of such a plan. (The } did not interv . since he was out of
