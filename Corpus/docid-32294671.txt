persons who have information in their file, but it should
be pointed out to Customs that it is felt if all of the
information is set down in anything other than a confidential
file maintained on a national level, then the life of the
informant is in great danger. It is noted that this informant
was formerly carried as a Top Jewel Thief of the Miami Office
and in connection with investigation of Jewel Theft Matters,
was developed by Special Agent HURST, to whom this informa-
tion was furnished,. as‘a result of almost daily contact by
Special Agent HURST, During this investigative period,
the identity of Special Agent HURST became known to many
of CI's criminal associates, who know there has been a
close association between the CI and Special Agent HURST.
It is felt that CI can be developed to furnish information
of great significance and for this reason, it would be better
if no one at U. S. Customs, except on a national level, know
that this information came from the FBI, as that factor alone
could Jeopardizé informant.

MM 137-1594 Sub Section

WALLACE D. SHANLEY, U. S. Customs, Miami, contacted the
Miami Office and advised he had received information from
a Confidential Source that MARTIN KATZ, son of Miami Top
Jewel Thief, ABE KATZ, was attempting to rent a plane for
a short, quick flight out of Miami that afternoon. The
purpose of the trip was not explained to the informant

of ‘Customs. SHANLEY furnished the information for whatever
value it might have and said he was going to follow the
matter to see if any Customs violation resulted.

Since MARTIN KATZ is the son of Miami Top Jewel
Thief ABE KATZ, and since a $35,000.00. jewel theft had
recently occurred of Center Jewelry Store, Miami, in view
of possibility the plane was going to be used to transport
this jewelry, Special Agents JAMES E. HASTINGS and GEORGE
STADTMILLER interviewed Miami PCI for any
information he might have regarding instant flight referred
to above, as has in past been involved in flyin
matters in the Miami area of questionable nature. —
then advised he had been approached by MARTIN. KATZ on the
morning of November 28, 1959, and been requested to get a
plane for a three-hour trip. C——]was to select a landing
place near Miami, and he was to land there and pick up
several suitcases. PCI had selected a landing strip near
Homestead, Florida, and the trip was being postponed to
11:00 p.m., November 29, 1959. [____]was under impression
flight entailed a smuggling operation into Cuba, and, there-
fore, this information was furnished to SHANLEY of Customs
on November 28, 1959, for whatever action deemed necessary.

On November 29, 1959, SHANLEY advised the Miami
Office he had determined above-mentioned flight had as its
purpose; shipping arms and ammunition to Cuba and, therefore,
no further action was taken by the Miami Office in.connec-
this proposed flight. .

as a result of this, he had been furnishing Customs with

was advised that since he was furnishing information to

organizations other than the FBI, that the FBI was not going

to cont him in the future. As a result of this, the 137-

case on ] was closed in the Miami Office.

 

It does not appear to the Miami Office that with
the above facts this constitutes a violation over which the
Bureau has jurisdiction. In order to further protect the
informant, and since the alleged "leak" apparently is in
the Miami Office of U..S. Customs, it is recommended that
the above information be furnished by the Bureau in Washington
to the Headquarters of U. S. Customs through established
liaison channels. It is recognized that information might
be received from time to time by any organization that
there is a “leak'' which information might be treated lightly,
as it might be attributed to the bragging of a hoodlum, It
is felt that in order to convince U. S. Customs that there
is a leak, it will be necessary to relate to them the entire
facts set forth above, including their file number, name of

arid ROTHMAN swore CI to secrecy that he would not reveal to
anyone under any circumstances that these reports had been
in ROTHMAN's possession. CI stated he knows this is hard
to believe; however, as proof he saw something, he said the
communication was dated December 7, 1959, and had what 1,
appeared to be File Number 23-801. CI said as best heb ld
can recall, the file related how MARTIN KATZ, Miami! bondsman
who is \son-of Miami Top Jewel Thief ABE’}KATZ, had gone to
CHARLEG{ HORMEL, much publicized Miami*adventurer and pilot
who hag \been involved in gun-running to Cuba,in the past,
to get’ HORMEL to get an airplane for him. It set forth
that HORMEL was working with U. S. Customs on this matter,
as was a man named HOGAN, who is with Liberty Aviation at
Miami International Airport. Also set forth was that the
airplane in question somehow was thought to contain jewelry
from a $35,000.00 jewel theft on 163rd Street, Miami, and
an FBI Agent named STADTMILLER was mentioned.

 

It then related how the plane was stopped and
Cubans were found aboard with dynamite bombs. CI was
exhaustively questioned about any further specific details,
but said this is all he can recall. CI said he cannot
specifically say what happened to the above-referred-to ‘papers,
exceptthat apparently the man who brought them to the Biltmore
Terrace Hotel had to return them to some place or person.
CI said on a later date, he had an opportunity to say some-
thing to ROTHMAN about the man who CI saw bring the papers
to ROTHMAN, and ROTHMAN indicated the man who brought the
papers was a waiter who is an undercover man for Customs
and who gets the papers from someone else. CI said he had
hopes he would hear from several sources about ROTHMAN's
having access to U. S. Customs reports, and then he would
not have been so apprehensive about passing on this informa-
tion, but it has not been a subject of conversation anywhere
and CI feels he has been close enough to the situation and
has enough sources of his own that if it were known, even
among a close circle of people, he would have heard it.) f

CI said the pnl inference that has been aad :
by anyone is that-MAXALURIE, who is_attorney for ROTHMAN, i

and also represents & /MANNARINO, well-known Pittsburgh “|-~

casual remark to CI about CHARLES HORMEL being a stool pigeon
for Customs and it was no wonder HORMEL recently received only
a 30-day sentence in connection with a federal case against
him in Miami. CI pointed out that the information given him
by ROTHMAN about the man who brought the papers being a waiter
and an undercower agent for Customs could be a lie, as there
is no question in his mind that in the past on occasion ROTHMAN

_has lied to him.

Special Agent HURST pointed out to CI that it would
be necessary to pass on the above information to U. S. Customs.
\ CI said when he. called to furnish this information, he knew

that- it would have to be furnished to U. S. Customs, and he
‘desired that this be done, as he felt that more and more
people's lives would be endangered if and when more reports
are obtained by ROTHMAN from Customs iff he can obtain. them

as he claims he can. CI said that anyone, such as HORMEL,
from the underworld, who furnishes information, will more than
likely be killed, and ROTHMAN, in his position with KELLY and
SAMMY MANNARINO, members of "The Outfit" in Pittsburgh, is

in a position to furnish information to the “right people"

who could cause people to be "yubbed out."

; CI further stated that he would never furnish informa-
tion to Customs, as Customs Agents are too indiscreet. CI said
he has been interviewed by Customs Agents in Miami and there
was little doubt in CI's mind when the interview was terminated
as to where Customs obtained their information. CI said that
if he obtains any further information regarding the identity

~~ of the person furnishing the information, he will advise.
CL stated he has the reputation of being a '"'blabber mouth"
and talking too much, which he said he probably does, and at
present, he feels he is in a precarious position, and for this
reason, hopes that every effort will be made to protect him
as the source of this information.

, As a matter of information, Miami Office is not aware
of what appears in Customs File 23-801, but the following did
occur, of which Miami has knowledge, which appears to verify
the information furnished by MM 660-C. On November 28, 1959,
