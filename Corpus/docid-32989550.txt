SEMSLIVE Sf atdied EATEUIGENCE OF EZ)
fon 4/9/64, lind 94-S* made the following observations
with regard to the) CP svatus of STANLEY LEVISON:

LEVISON has been an important Party member for
many years (and never at any time differed with the Party with
respect to the Party line. His only difference with the
Party has been with respect to the fact that in his opinion
the Party was not sufficiently "militant" in defending
Negro rights, In this respect, he has been to the "left"
of the Party, LEVISON's differences with the Party are merely

respect to the Party's handling of the Negro question. ‘The

fact that he does not accept domination by the Party with

regard to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement should not be
construed to mean that he has broken with the Party in all
respects, The Party today is as anxious to reestablish friendly
relations with LEVISON as it was in the past.

(zt should be noted that LEVISON never has been
officially- "drummed out" of the Party, nor has anyone ever
criticized him for being opposed to the Party's general
principles. it further should be noted that according to
‘the CP Constitution, it would require formal expulsion of
pines to state that he is officially out of the Party.

LEVISON never has said anything reflecting that
he does not continue to be a CP member, It.should be noted
shat it would be in the interests of the MARTIN LUTHER KING
movement, with which he is associated, if he would publicly
repudiateythe Party, which he has never done. It should be
Surther noted that in an effort to renew friendly relations

Dear Mr. Shaheen:

I want you to know how much I appreciated the °
opportunity to meet with you and your associates the other
day abont the Martin Luther King, Jr. case. It was most
helpful to have the benefit of the Bureau's knowledge con-~-
cerning the background of the case, and I can assure you
that we will do everything possible to avoid joepardizing —
any sensitive FBI sources or ongoing operations.

I do want to reiterate our need for the specific
items set forth in earlier document requests which would
presumably establish the factual basis for your conclusion
as of various dates in 1962, 1953 and'1964 that Stanley
Levison was a "secret member of the Communist Party, USA."
Of course in the event that there is no particular document
in any of those years wherein Levison was so-identified to
the FBI, I think it would be helpful for you to let us know
so that we may consider our outstanding requests in that
context. Finally, of course, we still need wmezcised copies -
‘of the Febrifary 22 and Jume 12, 178
New York which appear to nave been the articulated predicates
for the "cominfil”* case. -! —

|

Cnce again, I want to thank you for your time and
I look forward to nearing from you further on this subject.

U, 3. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS. WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to SSC requests contained in letter
of Senator Frank Church dated November 7, 1975, for materials
concerning Martin Luther King, Jr.

The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery
to the SSC of information and materials in response to requests
contained in the above SSC Ictter.

The attention of the SSC is invited to VBL memorandum

dated November 11, 1975, which referred to a highly sensitive
| oral briefing furnished te Senator Church and selected members

of the SSC Staff by FRE parsonnel on November 5, 1975. This
briefing was intended, in part, to serve in lieu of any
written information in response to SSC requests for communi-
cations documenting Stanley David Levison as a secret member
of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA).

Because of SSC. insistence in requesting items to
establish factual basis for Levison's secret CPUSA membership,
as set forth in referenced SSC letter, our New York office
was contacted for documents zepresenting original recordings
from Bureau informants concerning Levison. As a result our
New York office provided the material which is now being
delivered and which has served as a basis for statements in
various FBI documents that Levison was a secret member of

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Et is noted that referenced SSC letter requested un-
axcised copies of the February 22, and June 12, 1962, communi-
cations from New York which appear to have been the “articulated
predicates for the ‘cominfil* case." The SSC letter did not
identify captions of these communications; nor identify any
specific “cominfil case.” Therefore, we were unable to locate
any pextinent documents bearing these dates in our Headquarters:

Files. At a meeting on November 12, 1975, between SSC Staff
Member Michael Epstein and representatives of the Intelligence
Division of the FBI, it was agreed that the two documents
apparently referred to above are New York airtel dated February 12,
1962, captioned "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; SM«G" and New York
letter dated August 21, 1962, captioned “Communist Infiltration
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; iS-c."

New York airtel dated February 12, 1962, is being
delivered with this memorandum among those documents received
from our New York office. Excisions in this document are
fewer than those made in a capy previously provided the SSC. A
copy bearing no or fewer excisions cannot be provided the SSC
for reasons made clear during the oral briefing of Senator
Church and selected SSC Staff members on November 5, 1975.

It is noted that New York letter dated August 21, 1962,
which is being delivered with this memorandum, is not believed
to have been previously provided the SSC.
