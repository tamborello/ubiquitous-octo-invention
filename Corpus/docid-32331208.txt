_ At that time LANGLEY told informant that he has not been
connected with gambline enterprises for more than a year
and that he intends to retire from gambling. ——s_--

According to informant, LANGLEY purchased a house
at 6351 N. E. 19th Terrace, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, where
he resides with his wife, LANGLEY reportedly owns a
substantial interest in a’ pizza-pie business,

 

 

WFO will follow the activities of NESLINE and
subject closely and will advise the Bureau and Miami of
Significant developments,

. ‘ Miami will interview GEORGE LANGLEY regarding his
i. association with the subject and NESLINE. In this regard
po although LANGLEY claims that he has not been involved in
gambling enterprises for more than a year, it is likely

that he will be contacted by the subject, NESLINE, and other
prominent gamblers and hoodlums when they visit Florida.
LANGLEY is knowledgeable regarding top-level gambling

activity in Washington, D. C., and Florida for a substantial.
number of years.

WFO feels that LANGLEY would be an excellent target

4 ' for development under the Top Echelon Criminal Informant
s Program, . ; °

 

oe Miami, in contacting LANGLEY, should insure WF 1108-C
i _is fully protdcted. - ;
