he could think of is the fact that he is a member of the Rangers
Battalion Assn., which is an association of former members of the
Ist through 5th Ranger Battalions’ from World War II. He said the
headquarters of this group is located at 1772 North Orchid, Los
Angbtes, California, and they do maintain a roster. He said it might

Santa Barbara, Calif., and if his sunpoition is true he might be able
