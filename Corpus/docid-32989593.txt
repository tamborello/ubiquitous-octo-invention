On page 18, the indented paragraph contains a phrase,
"activity of Soviet intelligence agents." Since in this form
the statement would be classified “Secret,” the word "foreign"
will be used in place of "Soviet."

On page 2, footnote ** cites an FBI memorandum dated
June 19, 1966. The correct date is duly 19, 1966. Appropriate
correction will be made.

On page 2, footnote *** cites a date of May 22, 1954.
The correct date is May 20, 1954. Appropriate correction will

be made.

RE: FBI REVIEW OF SSC DRAFT REPORT ENTITLED
“WARRANTLESS SURREPTITIOUS ENTRIES BY
THE PEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS:
‘BLACK BAG' BREAK~INS AND MICROPHONE
INSTALLATIONS *

The following concerns a review by FBI Headquarters
(FBIHQ) representatives of the SSC draft report referenced
above:

On April 26, 1976, FBIHQ representatives and SSC
representatives John fT. ELMff, Janes Dick, and Fred Baron,
agreed that the following changes, corrections, and additions
were to be made to the SSC draft report:

Appendix I cannot be cleared for publication since
it includes statistics which are classified "Secret." Appen-
dix I will be delcted.

Appendix IIL lists surreptitious entries for micro~
phone installations conducted by the FBI in criminal investi~-
gations. Statistics included in this appendix are listed for
the periods 1960 ~ 1968, and 1969 ~- 1975. To be inserted
preceding the latter period and subsequent to 1968 will be

y tho statement: "The following entries were conductcd pursuant
bh to judicial warrants issued under Title IIT of the Ommibus
tt Crime Control Act of 1968."

se Page 22 contains a statement: “The Justice Depart-
i ment and the FBI have not terminated the use of warrantless

Assoc. Dr. _SUYKEptitious entry, either for clectronic surveillance purposes
pore On OL for other forms of search.” ‘The word “either” and the last

ae —porkion of the sentence reading "or for other forms of search"
Admin. will be deleted. Added following this altered sentence will

ne arse —be a new sentence: “Warrantless surreptitious entry for other
Fic &ten LOLS OF search is not presently being conducted, but, as

indicated in the Justice Department statenent, has not been

ruied out as a matter of policy in foreign intelligence cases.”
