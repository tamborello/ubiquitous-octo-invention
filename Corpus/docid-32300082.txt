CG T-30 is former PCI GLADYS EBLE, who resides
in an apartment building adjacent to the Armory Lounge,

position to observe and furnish the identities of automobile
license numbers in and near the Armory Lounge. \

CG T-31 is PCI HENRY H. HODL, who until recently
was employed as card dealer and "lookout" at the Riviera
Lounge, Niles, Illinois, which is an operation of GIANCANA
through his lieutenant, ROCCO POTENZO. He has been extremely
reluctant to furnish information; however, that which he has
furnished has proved to be reliable. \, ;

CG T-36 is a former PCI who was employed in the
kitchen of MEO's Norwood House Restaurant, a one time hoodlum
hangout. His whereabouts are now unknown. \\

CG T-37 is former PCE MICHAEL GALLAGHER, who at

CG T-68 is PCI GERARD C, "HAT" MURRAY, an old
time Chicago bookmaker who was recently severely beaten by
Syndicate hoodlums in what turned out to be a successful
attempt to bring him into the "syndicate" regarding his book-

fact that he has "gone to the other side" makes his current
reliability questionable, although the information he furnished
proved to be reliable. (J

Chicago confidence man who has a long record of arrests for
larceny, forgery, etc. He was in an excellent position to
