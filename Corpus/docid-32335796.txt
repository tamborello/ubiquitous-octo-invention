On January 5, 1965, Penn Jones, Publisher, "Midlothian"
Mirror", Midlothian, Texas, advised Delbert Ray resides at
Route 3, Midlothian, on a farm known as "White Gate Farm", which
Ray is buying on time. Ray is about forty years of age, married
and has two daughters. He is employed in Dallas, but his
employer is unknown.

Society which held meetings at Midland in 1961 and 1962. He
was then a close associate of Edgar Wesley Seay, another John
Birch Society member, who was employed by General Edwin Walker.
Jones stated that at 2:34 a.m., on April 30, 1962, a fire alarm
was sc.unded on an incendiary fire in the office of the
"Midlothian Mirror". This fire was caused by a gallon can of
gasoline or some other volatile fluid, with a paper fuse, which
had been thrown through the front door. Although no arrests were

— made, police felt certain that Seay either set the fire or

caused it to be set.

On January 14, 1965, DL T-1 advised there had been
no recent meetings of the "Minutemen" group in the Fort Worth
area. An individual known as Ray, the proprietor of a ranch
in the Venus-Midlothian, Texas, area, has been responsible for
distribution of "On Target" , the national "Minutemen"
publication to various members of the Fort Worth group.

Qn January 21, 1965, DL T-1, at Fort Worth, Texas,
advised that there had been no recent meetings held and none
were planned for the immediate future for the "Minutemen" group
in Fort Worth. (First Name Unknown) Budson, believed to be a
Sergeant in the National Guard, who either owns or workKs on a
ranch in the area of Bowle, Texas, has recently been seen in the
company of several members of the local group. While Hudson is
not known to be a member at present of this ‘group, it-is possible
he may be a target for recruitment.
