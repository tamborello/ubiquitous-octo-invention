SECRET

YURI I. NOSENKO

On 1/17/83, source was queried concerning any
knowledge he might have of the NOSENKO matter. He advised
that "officially" the KGB never discusses defectors and
generally all one would hear would be rumor and gossip.
NOSENKO is considered a "traitor" in the eyes of the KGB
as far as source is aware. AA.)

The source assumed that NOSENKO told western
intelligence everything concerning Second Chief Directorate
(SCD) activities in Moscow and further assumes that, as is
custom, a “special Commission" of the SCD was convened

following NOSENKO's defection tg do a damage assessment.
As an aside, source noted thatthis defection would be
"examined" by members of the K Directorate of the First
Chief Directorate and by members of the 9th Department of the
Ss Directorate |) ‘

   
  

between the NOSENKO defection in 196
assassination of President JOHN F. NNEDY“in~Ts
to give his opinion on the ome speculation that
NOSENKO defected under the directi of the KGB fo convince

  

source did not believe that to be the case. Infsource's

opinion, NOSENKO's defection and all the information he furnished
about the SCD would have been too great a pricd to pay "to

save one man." :

Source does not believe that(‘the KGB would risk C89
"blowing an illegal" by tasking the illegal attempt to
locate a defector such as NOSENKO in the west.| Likewise,
source has never heard that the KGB killed or attempted to kill
a defector. Such tions, if they ever occurred, certai

ended after OLEG LfALIN's defection in England in 1971 7] GS)

 

COMMENT : §
In 1969 (7% ATBAST illegal] was, in fact, ordered.
by the KGB to 269 vas topréerify ex. [A O's esence ata
Washington, D.C. apartmght complex. [arzash as not, hgwever,
