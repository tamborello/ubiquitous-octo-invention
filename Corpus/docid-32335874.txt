Re: AMERICAN UNDERGROUND, also known as
MINUTEMEN, FORT WORTH, TEXAS

The following information is supplemental to information
furnished in letterhead memorandum of Harch 26, 1965.

DL T-1 on March 31, 1965, advised that on March 30, 1965,
Arthur Pollard, Yan Pollard, Shirley Bob Renshaw, Otto “Duke” Koling,
and am unknown individual met at the Circle A Lounge, 3124 North
Main Street, Fort Worth, Tezas, The purpose of the meeting called
by Arthur Pollard was to discuss future action of the group in the
area. Several of the group commented that they believed they were
beirg followed from time to time and it was strange that as soon
ag they considered burglarizing a local National Guard Armory, that
the lighting around the Armory was improved. About 10:15 PH, a
well dressed white female, blonde hair, approximately 30 years of
age, accompanied by a man dressed in a business suit, joined the
group. The accompanying male did not approach the group. This un-
identified female, who was not introduced, stated that the group ‘-
was, for the present time, to curtail activities. The woman stayed
only briefly and then left, after which the renainng members of
the group dispersed.

 

DL T-1 advised that the woman, umknown to him, was ap-
parently from Dallas, and that Arthur Pollard stated following her
éeparture that this “action did not surprise him as he believed the
people in Dallas were very nervous at present and suspected the
Federal Government was presently keeping a very watchil eye on then.

DL T-1 advised that Otto "Duke” Koling has beem seen during
the past month with a National Guard Sergeant Hudson, from Bovie, Tezas.
DL 7-1 advised ke does not know if Hudson is in fact sympathetic with
the group but that Koling was to try and recruit hin,
