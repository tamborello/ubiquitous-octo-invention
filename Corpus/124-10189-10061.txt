TRAINING OF NEGROES IN CUBA

During late July and early August, 1967, a Latin-
American Solidarity Organization (LASO) conference was held in
Havana, at which the Cubans indicated that they were continuing
their efforts to implement the declared aims of the Tri-

‘Continental Conference. Numerous resolutions were promulgated

at the conclusion of the LASO conference, one of which exhorted
North American Negroes"to respond to the racist violence of

the imperialist United States Government.with an increase in
direct revolutionary action.'"' The American press and other news
media extensively reported on the presence of Stokely Carmichael,
foremost “black power" advocate of violence, in Cuba at the-time
of the LASO conference, which began on July 31, 1967. Since
that date all field offices of the FBI have been alerted to
Castro's obvious intention of infiltrating agents into this
country for the purposes of sabotage and influencing the black
nationalists and other subversive movements throughout the
United States. : :

Cur Agents on a selective basis have briefed officials
of various local, county and state police agencies of the
problem posed by the possible use of minority groups in carrying
out sabotage on benalf of Cuba. Thee officials have been.
requested to alert their racial and security informants to
provide any clues which would aid the ferreting out of potential

saboteurs. In daily contacts with cooperative security

officials of plants handling key Government contracts, department
stores, supermarkets, and similar establishments employing
Sizeable labor forces, our Agents have alerted such officials
to our interest in being expeditiously advised of data indicating
groups or individuals within their organizations are potential

To date, no conerete evidence has been developed to
indicate that any Cuban-trained saboteur has entered this
country since the widely publicized Cuban sabotage ring in
New York City was discovered and immobilized in 1962. Neither
has any evidence been developed of clandestine entry of Cuban-
trained Negroes for any other purposes, including infiltration
of the blacg nationalist movement. The FBI cu ntly is
operating pip Cuban-trained,intelligence agents double agents
or potentTal double agent ainst the Cubans None of these
Cuban-trained intelligence agents have any information indicating

TRAINING OF NEGROES IN CUBA

i
This Bureau is in receipt of a copy of a Central
intelligence Agency (CIA) communication dated October 31,
1887, regarding the training of Nesroes in Cuba. The original
of the communication was addressed to the Honorable Walt W,
Rostow, Special Assistant to the President. (8) (U| ;

‘Information is contained therein to the effect that
thvee Cuban sources during the past four jwonths have reported
the existence of a training school near Santiago de Cuba where
from 100 to 150 young men are being groomed for subversive
operations against the United States to include sabotage in
connection with race riots directed at bringing about a Negro
revolution in this country. One source reported that the
training includes courses in English, taught by Soviet
instructors. While two of the CIA sources described the

‘students as Negroes, there was no indication that any of the
» Negro students were from the United States, The third CIA
.# source described them as young men from North Vietnam, —
North Korea, Africa, and Latin-American countries (gu)

Information in the possession of this Bureau indicates
that the above-described training school may well be an outgrowth
of the Tri-Continental Conference, held in Havana, Cuba, in
January, 1966, the declared purpose of which was organizing
guerrilla warfare in Asia, Africa and Latin America. During the
year following the conference this Bureau received continuing
reports that the Cubans were endeavoring to implement the aims,

< of the conference. Since Castro first came to power in Cuba

  
 

in 1959, we have been alert to his possible use of refugee -

channels to infiltrate agents and saboteurs and have initiated

appropriate investigative steps to detect this. In January, 1967,

an additional program was instituted aimed at detecting Cuban-

trained agents and saboteurs entering the United States through

iegitimate Cuban refugee channels. Such refugees have been arriving

in Miami since December, 1965, at the rate of approximately

4,000 each month. 2in the ten months since our Cuban. refugee

program was first iostituted, over 1,700 cases have been opened

based upon information in the backgrounds of various refugees

S\ pointing toward a sotential or propensity on their parts to

& undertake intellicence, sabotage, or other subversive nissions oi
on behalf of the Cuban Government. Currently hese cases are Pag

. being opened at ‘2 rate of about 200 a month yg A) .
