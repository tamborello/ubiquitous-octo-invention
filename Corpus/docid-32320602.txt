The attached letter to the Director from the
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), advises of
determinations concerning JFK records. The Swiss government
approved the release of the documents this way and the FBI is in
agreement with the ARRB determinations. The details of the five
foreign government documents have been set forth in John A.
Hartingh to Mrs. Morris memorandum dated 12/18/95, which notified
CID and NSD of the release of information.

The other documents described in the 12/18/95

memorandum will be addressed in a letter from the ARRB around
12/27/95, which may raise some appeal issues
