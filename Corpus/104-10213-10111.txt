information reported in paragraph 1, b above, However,-the sinillarity
| of the titles is obvious, and the tentative identification of the composer
lends additional credence to the Station's suspic % regarding the unusual

nature of the intercepted conversation. Headqdaters would appreciate
receiving any further information which gee Wmay be able to develop

* on other conversations between "Alfonso" and his Cuban counterpart, as
well ag any comments or information which Mexico City may be able to
provide on the personalities mentioned in reference.

  

Distribution:
3 -COS, Tegu
2 - COS, Mexi

    

Note: There i: a strong possibility that the songs referred to in paragraphs
1b and 3 are the same since the Spanish words Tres (three) and seis (six)
are often confused when heard by non-Spanish speakers.

HIITA-3762, 17 June 1964
For Your Information

1, The following information was obtained from AMMUG-1 when
questioned concerning his knowledge of songs used in radio communication:
in connection with reference:

AES, KenL OS

a. When gegmeetiie, died "AUGUSTO" personally came to the Hatiural
Liberation Buildin and held a meeting with the officers of that section. He
instructed those individuals who maintained communications ‘with organiza-
tions of their 1espective countries, as well as with some agent, to prepare
a system of communication using some Song, Ivcture, commercial, etc. ,
which could be transmitted by Pidio Havana, Cuba, and could be used to send
easily understood ciphered messages.

b. ANMMUG-1 believes that Norberto HERNANDEZ Curbelo chose
the musical recording of "Las Seis Lindas Cubanas" fSix Beautiful Cubans),
or something similar. He believes this sung was written in the 1920's hy
Antonio Maria ROMEU, who leads his own orchestra; however, the sung
was made popular by the "ARAGON' orchestra during the "Cha Cha Cha era."
(Comment: FOMEU is approximately 80 years old and undoubtedly is identical
with the individual referred to as Antonio Maria ROMERO in reference. )

2, “AUGUSTO" or "Agusto" was previously identified by AMMUG-1 as
Deputy Chief of the DGI, and is probably identical with Carlos Sixto CHLAIN
Soler, Deputy to Manuel PINEIRO, Chief of the DGI. -

3. It is not known whether there is any Connection between the sone
tilles mentioned in reference as "tres lindas Cubanas" and the AMMUG-1
