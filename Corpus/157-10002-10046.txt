Mr. Elder. I remember it very well. I had the weekend

Mr. Elder. Is it a curse or a blessing?

Mr. Schwarz. Have you always had ‘that amazing memory?

Mr. Elder. Yes, I have. It's just a gift.

Mr. Schwarz. What were the circumstances?

Mr, Elder. He had reviewed a paper.

| of Station in Europe but also to visit with the heads of

5 | friendly liaison services. He made a trip to the Far East.
6 The principal point of it was a meeting of the Chiefs of Station

7 from the Far East area | Sor) where, of course, he was

 

8 briefed extensively.
9 | He also received extensive briefings at headquarters between

10 the period, I think he became a consultant technically on
ll the 13th of October. i

12 Mr. Kirbow. Did you accompany him on these trips?

Mr. Elder. No, I did not.

14 | Mr. Kirbow. But Mr. Dulles did accompany him, at least
15 || on the European trip?

16 Mr. Elder. The European trip, Mr. Helms and Mr. Bissell

18 Mr. Kirbow. Would you give us some idea of about how

21 | time he spent collectively with the briefings by the various

2 Bissell and Mr. Helms on the Far East trip?
é ° Mr. Elder. I believe the Far Eastern trip lasted about |
é 4 10 days. The trip to Europe was about two weeks. They |
5 travelled together. They were not necessarily quartered together.
6 | But they were together for the full working day ana there .
7 | were usually evening business sessions.
8 | Mr. Kirbow. Do you of your own knowledge know if they visite

9 both the stations during that

 

 

10 trip?

il Mr. Elder. No, I do not know that precisely.
3 12 Mr. Kirbow. Do you have any reason to think that they
Z . . t
: 13 || would have avoided those two stations? .
; 14 Mr. Elder. I can think of no reason to avoid those

is two stations except that they are not major stations.
16 Mr, Kirbow. Were there any records in Mr. McCone's
1? files of the details of the briefings or of other meetings

18 of importance on either of these trips?

 

2 19 Mr.‘ Elder. There are records but they are skimpy because

8 i
4 20 he felt that he had no official capacity and no official

i 21 need for those records.
