undeveloped LIONION pulse camera film to Headquarters for
processing. Headquarters plans to forward a positive and a
negative copy of the developed film to Station JMWAVE for
reading and possible printing use respectively. The original
negative will be retained in Headquarters for record purposes.

Station Mexico City case officer, during hig recent TDY at
Headquarters, 1t was decided not to send any copies of the

3. To insure moat expeditious handling, the Station
ghould send the films directly to the desk since KURIOT does
