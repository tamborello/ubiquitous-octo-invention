FROM: SAC, CHICAGO (92-349)

SAMUEL M. Ce raNcaNa, Aka. , ;

AR 1
ReBuairtel to New York, cc all offices, dated 2/1/61.
Review of file on GIANCANA reflects: (1) He is

not the subject of a substantive case and no process is out-
standing against him.

 

(2) Investigation to date has not. revealed any
vulnerable areas wherein a violation within the Bureau's |
jurisdiction may be established. A faint possibility exists
wherein GIANCANA, an ex-convict who travels extensively in
interstate commerce, may carry a firearm. All offices who
cover territory where GIANCANA travels have been alerted to
this possibility. y

(3) The area of Internal Revenue violation would
appear to be the most feasible one in that investigation has
revealed GIANCANA to have allegedly invested heavily in Las
Vegas gambling casinos, in motels in the Chicago area, and
in the juke box and coin machine field. The exact amount
of these investments have not been determined to date, and
investigation is directed toward ascertaining GIANCANA's
financial activity with particular reference to the identity
of the individual or individuals who channelize his funds.
Particular note is being made on the following:

 

  

(1) BEN JAFFE, President of the Guarantee Reserve,“
Life Insurance Company, Hammond, Indiana. This company igStied
a mortgage on GIANCANA's River Road Motel in 1957 and has
figured in heavy investments in hotels in Miami and Las vegas.\/

wh (3) Garbage ass poate Fee panes Information has
been received indicating Oo be involved in the .

operation of the Standard Disposal and Metal Company and GIANCANAS
lieutenant, WILLIAM DADDANO, to be involved in the operation of
the West Suburban Scavenger Service. These relatively new
companies are presently fighting the Chicago Scavenger
Association in obtaining new customers and it is noted that
most of the new accounts represent hoodlum controlled night-
clubs and restaurants.

GIANCANA is allegedly the number one man of the so-called
Chicago Syndicate. If this is true, then he necessarily controls
all investments of Syndicate moneygained from both illicit and
legitimate activity. One phase of the investigation on GIANCANA
has been directed to the identities of individuals in a position
to indicate positively GIANCANA's influence and identification
of Syndicate, sic GIANCANA's controlled enterprises. \ }
