‘CUBAN SUBVERSION IN LATIN’ AMERICA

oa Introductory Statement

: The public pronouncements of Cuban leaders, the
“daily record of ‘events in Latin America, and reports
from our “intelligence sources within ‘Comuitinist and :
other. left-extremist elements throughout thig hemis~'

ae

phere ‘all agree on. ‘one salient conclusion: that

  
  
  
 
 

tidel Castro is encouraging and supporting the efforts
Sonmunists to overthrow and seize control of the Y
rnments: in Latin America.

\ Analysis: Andicates that ‘the immediate |

    

; _ stems less. from the subversive efforts of tra- mo,
| vditdonal, Communist movements than from cuban.
“support of: iy. and all. active revolutionary ‘and.

terrorist movements.

 

Be ‘These distinctions aré not: precise. In. some.

‘countries, . ‘Castro’ s original success has ‘Spurred.

  

Sstablished: ‘Communist. movement. to ‘getion, tS

cand “he ‘supports it.” In, others, the old-time

 

“Communists. may. even. “oppose radical action at this
“tiie, and ‘Castro works vith more: active and more

militant revolutionists.
