CG T=9:, who has furnished reliable information in the
past, advised SA ROEMER on June 25, 1959, that he has learned
that GUS ALEX went to Switzerland recently, within the past
five or six months, in order to arrange for the negotiation
of Canadian securities there. He said that the ostensible

‘purpose of ALEX' visit was for a vacation’and skiing trip, but .
that he was actually there carrying out the request of hoodlums
in Canada who had somehow obtained these securities, The
informant stated that he understands that ALEX "botched" the
job and was unable to arrange for disposal ef the securities as
was expected. The hoodlums who were interested, therefore, were
unhappy with ALEX and refused to reimburse him for his trip.

- The informant stated that ‘he Was, unable to furnish .
‘any more information regarding this. He ‘was unable to advise
as to how the Canadian hoodiums ebtained the securities, the
nature of the securities or how ALEX was endeavoring to dispose
of them. :

; CG T-9 was asked for the source of his information
regarding this. He stated that he has many contacts whom he
believes to be involved in hoodlum operations but whom he’ ~
does not knew by name. He said that one of these is the source
for the above.. He said he believes: the information authoritative

- but could add nothing more.

Police Bureau, Bern, ’ switzerland, reported” that investigation
at St. Moritz, Switzerland, has failed to show that GUS” ALEX
was in that locality during March, 1959. Further, additional
inquiry by the Swiss has revealed that it appears improbable —
that subject was involved in the: burglary of a ‘jewelry shop’ at
St. Moritz, Switzerland, March 4, 1959. The Swiss now believe
that this burglary was the work of Italian hoodlums.

CG T~5, above, advised. on August 7, 1959, that GUS
ALEX continues to control the First Ward of the City of Chicago
for the Chicago Crime Syndicate. . He stated that nothing of ~
an illegal nature operates on an organized basis in the First
