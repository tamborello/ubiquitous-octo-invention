TO: DIRECTOR, FBI (92-2940)
FROM: ~° SAC, PITTSBURGH (92-226)
SUBJECT: SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, aka
ANTI~RACKETEERING
(00:PTTTSBURGH)

ly : . : WEEKLY AIRTEL SUMMARY

 

LA ROCCA, according to informants, is still
travelling throughout the State of Florida and has not
contacted any of his business operations for more than
a week.

On Saturday, 2/16/63, Special Agents of the

Pittsburgh Office of the FBI entered the Jockey Club at
hester, W. Va., which was being operated by JOSEPH (JO-JO)
PECORA in the absence of CHARLES FREDERICK TEEMER who

is vacationing at Miami, Florida. PECORA was arrested
and arraigned before the United States Commissioner at ~y
Wheeling, W. Va., on 2/16/63. PG 632-C has advised that .
immediately following his release from incarceration: on

bond, PECORA visited MIKE GENOVESE at the GENOVESE farm
located at RD#2, Box 149-B, Gibsonia, Pa., and remained
in conference with GENOVESE for approximately five hours.
GENOVESE is obviously in charge of the Pittsburgh situation
during the absence of LA ROCCA, but Pittsburgh informants yu
do not anticipate any forced return by LA ROCCA to the
Pittsburgh area as a result of the Jockey Club incident.

SUBJECT SHOULD RE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
