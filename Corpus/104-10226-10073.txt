I, OPERATIONAL

1. As reflected in the attached (separate cover) report submitted
by the ANSCROLL Secretary General, there were two personnel changes
made during the month, The first was to replace the commentator on

“the early morning farm workers radio program who died in May, The
second was to bring into full-time status a former part-time employee
of the propaganda department, .

       
       
   
     

2, The AMSCROLL report also details the contacts made during-
the month with other groups and individuals of significance, and
contains an enclosure by AMBLEAK/1, on correspondence maintained with
officials of governments and organizations of political significance
throughout the hemisphere, Although-these activitios are not of direct
operational value, they are important to the’ AMSCROLL image, which
must bo improved constantly if the organization hopes to have a good
standing in exile and, more.importantly, a future in Cuba, Other
enclosures in the AMSCROLL Secretary General's report, such as the
‘summaries of the activities of the Women's and Labor Department, etc,,
are in the same vein, One item which should be noted is the Cuban
stamp commemorating the third anniversary of the "Victory of Giron,"
which shows the U,S, eagle in a gun sight as it falls to its death,
Perhaps KUWOLF might conjure up an appropriate reply to be used at

the correct psychological moment sometime in the future,
