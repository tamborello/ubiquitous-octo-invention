of Ray to effect an operation inside Cuba, JURE had suffered a psycho-
logical letdown. This letdown has been cozpounded by Ray's July, 1964
failure to infiltrate Cuba. In July of 196 Ray was stopped by US
Customs Agents at Key West, Florida, and in a subsequent attempt to go
to Cuba, he was stopped by the US Coast Guard. Rogelio Cisneros, head
of JURE in Ray's absence, resigned, and minor groups withdrew from

and rule of JURE, which was to fight Castro from within Cuba. Ray
said he had no information concerning the idéntity of those responsible

sible for JURE to have conducted the attack, JURE had no boats in
