and desired charges be dropped against HITSON so ‘he could be
returned to Florida to be of assistance to law enforcement
authorities, HITSON advised he had known Sgt. HENNING for

- some. 15. to 18 years and he Was one of the few honest police officers
in the SO, Tampa, Florida. HITSON stated that he desired
to return to Florida to work back into the organization, where-
by being able to furnish information of value. He said he
realized he was rfsking his life. HITSON advised there were
many dishonest officers but he did. not know their identities.
He stated he is able to make this statement because he knows
from experience that most of the time when a raid is planned
on any gambling club in the Tampa. area, the owners “ upuplly
receive a telephone call prior to the arrival of the officers
in sufficient time to give them a chance to get rid of any
gambling evidence.

‘HITSON advised he would be glad to be of assistance
to the FBI upon his return to Florida but did not desire Sgt.
HENNING to know 6f his cooperation with the FBI at the same
time. He said that if- he is successful in returning to Florida
he would be in telephonic contact with the FBI Office and make
arrangements to furnish information on a confidential basis.

To date, 5/20/64, no further. information has been
heard from ‘HITSON in the Tampa Division.
