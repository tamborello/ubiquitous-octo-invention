(2) Viet Cong-initiated incidents for the week of 11-18
December were at the same level as the previous week. How-
ever, activity in the important delta area declined. The
II Corps Tactical Zone had a 25 per cci:* >. se in insurgency
incidents, with the coastal Binh Dinh Vrovince bearing the
‘brunt of the actions. VC attacks on strategic hamlets in
that provinces have increased sharply since the 9th RVN Army
Division dsr lLoyed to the delta area last September. The one

 

company-size attack ‘during the week was thé first large-scale
operation in December, as compared to 17 in November and a
1963 monthly average of 12. In this assauit of two strategic

hamlets in Ptuice ‘thanh Province cn 14 December, the governmer

 

 

forces surfered cne killed, 2 wounded, anc 13 missing in acti
. Also lost were 27 weapons and radios. No enemy casualties
eon were reported. There is no indication that the VC stepped ur
' their efforts in connection with National Resistance Day on
19 December. .
(3) Military control of two critical provinces has been
shifted to strengthen antiguerrilla operations in the delta
area as follows: The 7th Division, III Corps, took over tne

Kien Hoa sector from the 9th Division, IV Corps on 16 Decembe

IIt Corps Commander,
(4) Three us Army aircraft crashes during the week took

 

the lives of 10 US personnel. In IV CTZ on 12 December, a
CH-37 was hit by VC ground fire while evacuating a downed

 

OV-1, Although the Pilot jettisoned the Sling-loaded Plane,
he <ould. not contro1 the CH-37 and it Plunged to the ground
burning on impact. In another incident, three us personnel

 

‘were killed and one is missing and presumed dead as a result
of a U-1A crashing into the side of a mountain approximately
200 miles northeast of Saigon. On 14 December, a UH-1B

 

crashed into the sea about one-half mile off the shore of
the Binh Dinh Province. The co-pilot swam to shore but the
remaining crew members drowned. Causes of the latter two
accidents have not been determined,

(5) In order to meet requirements for additional artillery
in the delta area, certain 105-mm howitzer batteries have
been increased from 4 to 6 tubes each. Forty-two additional —
105-mm howitzers were airlifted to South Vietnam by 22 December

to meet this requirement.

air drop of troops, equipment, and supplies. Despite this
judgment, the Army has requested that the AURI be prepared

 

to furnish air support to the ground troops in Borneo ~- a
request which it is reported, has angered the AURI. Lacking

suitable airfields in Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan) from

 

which to mount jet fighter escort missions, the AURI is
extremely reluctant to make unescorted TU-16/Badger strikes
against Malaysian Borneo targets.

eC. Malaysia/New Zealand/Australia. The Malaysian Government

asked the New Zealand Government, on 19 December, for aid in

 

training its Army and for assistance in Sarawak and Sabah, to

 

include special service units, AAA units and assist at airfields
New Zealand is prepared to allow its transport aircraft now at
Singapore, and perhaps others, to be used for ferrying to and ~
within Sarawak and Sabah, to commit a naval frigate and make

one battalion available if the situation in Borneo deteriorates.
However, the New Zealand Government, like the Australian, is

reluctant to commit forces directly in defense of Malaysian

 

Borneo. Both believe that such involvement would reduce greatly
or destroy their political influence with Indonesia and perhaps

stimulate Djakarta to take even more aggressive action against

 

the territories.

where he is preparing to cut all ties with the West, except
France, and to align Cambodia more closely with the Communist
Bloc. His recent directives reportedly are spreading con-

of the Indian Government, is inviting danger to Southeast
Asia.

(2) On 24 December, a Communist-led youth demonstration
was conducted in the square across from the US Embassy to
protest the US 7th Fleet extension into the Indian Ocean.

(3) The Tndonesian Navy and Air Force may replace their
Western trarsnort and ASW aircraft with Soviet equipment."
Defense Minister General Nasution reportedly bought six
Soviet AN-i2/U2t cransports during his recent trip to Moscow.
He allegedly also said when he was in Washington that the
Navy would repiace its ASW-configured Fairey Gannets with
Soviet Bloc ASW-aircraft. Indonesia is said to claim that
it can get out of the AN-12 contract if allowed to purchase
five more Lockheed C-130 s. This suggests that any deal
with the Soviets is tentative. The acquisition of AN-12 s
and ASW counterparts of Indonesia's 14 Gannets would require
additional Soviet technicians to provide local maintenance.

(4) The Indonesian Air Force (AURT) visualizes only a
limited role in the event of an open conflict with British

and Malaysian forces; operations would mainly consist of
