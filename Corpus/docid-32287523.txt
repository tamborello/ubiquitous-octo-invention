manifests maintained at Tijuana, B.C., Mexico, failed to
locate any record of TRAFFICANTE and his wife leaving

records are not maintained in good order and therefore
this search would not be conclusive.

Extended investigative period occasioned by
desire to include results of investigation conducted by
an auxiliary office which were not available at time of
