Mr. Edgar. Just a point following up on. Mr. Fithian’ s
comments GI would hope that some research has been done on
exactly how to do what you are talking about. ‘pewause ff I
remember the last two Congresses, we_ took the first ry weeks”
of January off, and. the first. legislative day was not until ~
mid-January at the earliest, 18th, ast, othg aaa Trere is a
great deal of organizational work. that is done ‘there, and Tr
would hope that we wouldn't find ourselves ina position where!
we die on the 3lst and have to ask our staff to be volunteers

Mr. Blakey. It is unlikely that the staff would, given ;
the history of the last similar request. “Nevertheless, there
has to be a resolution introduced by House Administration for
all Committees, Judiciary on, and it would be appropriate to

put us in there, and it would be extremely unusual for us to

 

be taken out. It. would require a vote for us to be taken

;
out. And if it is put. simply as clean-up, which is what it ‘wo uld
t
{
|

i be, I doubt that it would present an issue of controversy.

Spokes De
The Chairman, I think maybe what Mr. ‘Edgar has in mind

is a. pay lag system that occurs*in January.
