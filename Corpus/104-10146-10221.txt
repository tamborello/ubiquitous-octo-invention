to Cornwell that the individual is actually an Agency employee and came on
board in 1974. Cornwell agreed that the interviewer need not be aware of the
Agency connection and I explained that we would instruct the individual to
respond fully to the questions asked by the staffer, but to stay strictly within
his Defense cover, Cornwell fully agreed and said no notation will be made in
the Committee files on his present CLA connection, Ashbaugh was notified and I
requested that he instruct the individual to maintain his cover during the
