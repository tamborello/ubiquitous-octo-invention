NOTE FOR MR. BUNDY

The attached is a good roundup of what
happened in Brazzaville last week and probably
will be interesting reading for the President,
unless he has been following the developments
through other sources. . This is the only
report I have seen that mentions the secret
agreement between Youlou and France, as
well as de Gaulle's personal role in ‘the matter.
