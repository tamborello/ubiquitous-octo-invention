have all of the documents that wa ought to look at, and I think
they are looking for more documants. Things we read referred

to things that were not there. So I don't think we can be

, Satisfied yet that the full record is available for perusal.

The second thing is, in our quick look it is very apparent
We must have the documentation. I saw some which would
been very important in our questioning McCone, which may

helped him remember things. It was vary central to it.

i
!
;

I think we wasted a couple of hours when it could have been
vary quickly with one or two documents.

I saw, there were saveral other documents that immediately

struck me as being essential to our work. I don't think we saw

anything that was revolutionary or that filled in a lot of the

‘euntral gaps.

Senator Tower. You didn't see anything that was sensitive

; to the extent that it might reflect on a foreign government,

“or somathing like that?

Senator Mondale. There might be stuff in there, honestly,
I don't know. But just looking at our work --

Senator Tower. What you're gaying, Fritz, is you don't

: think we need all of it, that we could select out some of it,

‘
|

tis that it?

Senator Mondale. What I am saying is I think there is
mors available somewhere than wa saw, and they said they are

still looking. Hills said he wasn't satisfied that it was all

 
there yet, and secondly, wa've got to have it.

Senator Tower. Right.

Senator Mondale. And we need it for cross-examination and
we need it --
Senator Tower. Well, the question is, do you need every-
thing that you looked at today, or do you think --
| Senator Mondale. I don't know. Some of the stuff we
already have.

Mr. Bader. Some, we already have.

Senator Mondale. So we don't need that.

 

 

Senator Tower. Yes.

Senator Mondale. Tha other material, it struck me that

WARD & PAUL

TI don't see what we have to lose by having most of it. I think
+ imost of it is historical.

Senator Baker. I think we ought to have all of it, John.

Senator Huddlaston. One quastion on the documents.
Is that just the material that the Rockefeller Commissicn
has had?

Senator Baker, No, the Rockefeller Commission apparently

’ "has not had these Nsc Minutes,

Senator Mondale. ‘They did not have tha NSC minutes.

Mr. Schwarz. They asked for them and wa were told about

circumstance.
It 1s also clear to me that some documents have not yet
S .
been located and supplied to us and that parts of some documents

have been deleted. I think we probablv can qet that deleted

jJinformation before very long.

 

The suggestion was made that wa ask the White House to

bring those documents up here by their own personnel on Monday
ho
30 that we could use them to examine witnesses. If they care

i
-to keep someone here to retain technical nossession of the

i documents, to take them back with them at the close of that day
"or any day on which we use them, they might do that, and that
sooner or later we would have to find a way to utilize those
documents, meaning to put certain documents in the record

or to read them into the record or to supply copies.

Rod Hill seemed to think well of that idea. T told him
that I would suggest it to Senator Tower and to the rest of
the Committee, and hopefully Senator Tower or Senator Church
would be back in touch with the White House to see if we can
negotiate an agreement alona those lines. I think we can. I

“think the White House will agreé to that arrangement.
Senator Mondale. There are two points T would like to
: make. N ,
Senator Tower. Fritz?
Senator “Mondale. I think Hills was saying, from some of

‘the documentation we looked at it was clear that we may not yet

Senator Morgen. It was prepared by whom?

Senator Baker. Belin, the Executive Director.

Mr. Bader. The last category, thea fourth category, ara
some Special Group minutas, that is, a file, it is a tiny file,
lreatiy, of assassinations and allegations, and these minutes
were culled from Special Group meatings and they are highly
iiseluctive in the sense that they are documents as thay could

find them in their search that relatsd only to Cuba and it igs

clear that there is a great deal more to come in this category

Senator Schweiker. You mean more that you have not seen

 

_ yet?

: Mr. Bader. More that they have not put together as yet,

or at least they have not made available to us, and those were

ithe four categories.

It is a little hard to judge just how much work it will

. “take to go through them. It is, I would say, somewhere around

-499 to 500 pages, perhaps.

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, I would ask Fritz and Bill

;

to monitor what I'm about to say next to make sure that T reflect

Pit accurately.

There is a general uneasiness at the White House about

. letting us have these documents unrestricted, although pretty

relearly they are committed to let us have them, under some

Senator Towar. Tha Committee will come to order.

Before we proceed to hear the witness, I think we should
have a report from the team that went down to the White House
this morning to examine some documents, and I believe they
will report to us and have a recommendation on how the Committees ;
should agree to handle this material, and shall I call on --

Senator Mondale. Iloward has the notes.

Senator Tower. I call on Senator Baker.

 

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, Rill Rader has the notes.
Senator Mondale. Well then, call on ma, I can raad them.

Senator Tower. Mr. Bader?

WARD & PAUL

Mr. Bader. Thank you, Senator.

The documents that we reviewed briufly at the White House

iigituation room were four different categories.

 

In the first category, there were copies of the so-called
‘Mongoose files. These files contain minutes of the Special

\Group Augmented and copies of the rest of the Mongoose files,
ho

arranged in chronological order. And these holdings are from
: he files of the Fxecutive Secretary of the 49 Committee and
include the files of the Chairman and the Executive Secretary

we “of the Special Group Augmented.

Also these trust files are turned over to the Chairman hy

Mr. Baker. That is a some 80 or 90 Page document which, as.
‘I say, is a‘summary of facts, and this was Prepared by David

Senator Baker. It might he important to note here, Mr.
Chairman, that the White House indicated to us that that summary
was not a Rockefeller Commission document and did not nacessarilv
represant the position of the Rockefeller Commission as such.

That is the way I interpret their languaqe.
