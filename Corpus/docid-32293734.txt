Informant also stated STONE and MILLER are: continuing
their bookmaking activities in Dallas, but only on a small scale,
He stated they are handling this business strictly “hand to hand",
meaning they are meeting their customers at various downtown Dallas
restaurants and clubs where they furnish the customer the line
they have by noon each day,.and then immediately take the custo-
mer’s bet. Informant stated they are not using any: telephones
in their business at 'the present time.

The above information was furnished to EDD HASKINS,.
ERS, Intelligence Section, Dallas, and Detective BH. M. HART,
- Dallas PD, Intelligence Section, on 7/27/63.

RE: RUSSELL DOUGLAS MATTHEWS, aka.
ITAR - GAMBLING :
(DL 166-102)

On 7/27/63, DL 185-C-TE advised that MATTHEWS was.
presently in possession of-$30,000 which he had obtained for
“planting somebody”, meaning murder for money. Informant had no
further details concerning this, but stated he would attempt to
ascertain same.

RE: JAMES WALTER CHERRY, aka.
ITSP; FTSMV
(DBL 87-11447)
(OG ~ KANSAS- CITE)

On 7/26/63, it was ascertained at. the Dallas county so
that a. $2,000 bond had been set on the local charges of narcotics
possession pending against CHERRY. It had been set in-Justice of
Peace CHARLIE DAVIS’ court. [It was further determined that the
detainer for the USM concerning ITSP, charge outstanding at Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, was still in effect, and CHERRY had been unable
to make either the $2,000 local bond or the $10,000 recommended
bond on the Federal charge.

 

Lt. FRANK CORNWALL, Dallas PD, was advised of above on
1/26/63 and he became quite. irritated, “noting: that. CHERRY is a- -
three-time 6%-convict, is charged with. a matter which can :
in a 30 to 40 year sentence. and the small - -g@mount of bond wor
enable CHERRY to gain his freedom and immediately begin burglarizing
again.
