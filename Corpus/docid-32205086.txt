LATIN AMERICA

Most Latin American governments have declared
one or more days of mourning in homage to President
Kennedy, reflecting in part the widespread public
and official sympathy--and concern~-throughout the
area arising from! his death, The leaders in vari-
ous countries have emphasizéd Kennedy's special in-
terest in Latin America and his effort to promote
the Alliance for Progress,

Venezuelan President Betancourt declared that
"Latin America loses the United States President
who has made the greatest efforts toward solution
of its economic and social probléms," a comment which
was reiterated insimilar form by other political
leaders in this country. The Chilean Foreign Minis-
ter pointed out that Kennedy had shown "special con=
cern for the situation of the people of Latin America"
and had attempted to promote "the improvement of their .
social and economic conditions," In addition to not-
ing Kennedy's "vision of a better future for Latin
America" through the Alliance for Progress, the Pana-
manian Foreign Minister specifically commented on the
President's "clear understanding of Panama's problems,"

President Oswaldo Lopez of Honduras, with whom
the United States suspended diplomatic relations fol-
lowing the recent military coup in that country, was
among the chiefs of state who declared days of offi-
cial mourning and expressed sympathy for the "irrepara—
ble loss," No reaction is yet available from the de
facto military-civilian regime in the Dominican Repub-
lic, with which the’ United States also suspended rela-~
tions recently. ; , :

_CONEIDENELAL

Silently in the rain before the city hall as the
Freedom Bell tolled. Mayor Brandt observed, "America
has lost its President and a tortured mankind has
lost-a man of whom so many people believed that
he would show the road toward a just peace and a
better life in the world." He added that Berlin
now put its confidence in President Johnson, who
came to Berlin a few days after the wall was built.

Adenauer observed that Kennedy "gave his life
for freedom and peace. I know that all -Germans
Share these sentiments."

Italian Christian Democratic leader Moro ex-
pressed his grief at the death "of the main archi-
tect of the courageous and renewing policy carried
out by the US the last few years,"

Pope Paul today said a mass for the repose of
the President's soul, and in a special broadcast,
voiced the hope that the death ‘may not do harm to
the American people, that it may strengthen their
moral and civil sense by reinforcing their senti-
ments of nobility and concord." :

_ Dutch Premier Marijnen said the murder was a
disaster for international politics and would have
far-reaching consequences, —

The conservative Svenska Dagbladet in Stockholm
wrote that "The mourning for Kennedy is so grea
because he was in many respects ahead of his tim."
The Washington correspondent of the Swedish radio
reported that the style, tactics, and political
climate in Washington will undergo a change, and
wondered how it would effect the interplay between
East and West. :

On the radio, Norwegian Premier Gerhardsen re-
marked that "In a strange way we felt secure with
} President Kennedy in the high and important post he
: held. We trusted him, and we believed in his de-
Sire for justice and peace, as well as in his ability
to smooth international disputes."

The Portuguese radio said that President Kennedy
had recently taken a special interest in Portuguese
affairs, discussing the problem of African colonies
with Foreign Minister Nogueira and praising the role
of the Azores in Operation Big Lift. , ao

WESTERN EUROPE

Expressions of dismay and Sympathy came from
virtually every government and political leader in
Western Europe. Everywhere periods of mourning
and memorial services have been announced, and
flags will be flown at half staff. Communist party
leaders joined in the lament over the President's
passing. .

The British royal court will go into mourning
for. a week, and a national commemoration service
will be held. Queen Elizabeth sent messages to
Mrs. Kennedy and to President Johnson, and Prime
Minister Douglas-Home cabled Johnson his assurances
of friendship and support. Sir Winston Churchill
said that the act had "taken from us a great states-
man and a wise and valiant man... Those who come
after Mr. Kennedy must strive the more to achieve
the ideals 6f world peace and human happiness and
dignity to which his presidency was dédicated."

The London Times said the event was "a shock -
‘great enough to Shake the structure of the world,"
And it added, "Our hope in this moment must be
that the Vice President will quickly be able to lay
his hands on a helm that cannot be left unheld even
for a moment."

Canadian Prime Minister Pearson told the Com-
mons that "the world can ill afford at this time
to lose a man of his courage." Opposition leader
Diefenbaker echoed this sentiment.

In France, President De Gaulle, said, "Presi-
dent Kennedy has died like a soldier under fire,
doing his duty in the service of his country. In
the name of the French people, as always a friend
of the American people, ft salute this great ex-
ample and this great memory." : :

} ‘West German Chancellor Erhard, whose trip to

‘ the US is cancéIled, will hold a special meeting
of.the Cabinet. on Sunday in commemoration of the
President.

. ‘Erhard cabled Mrs. Kennedy that "Only our
heirs will be able to realize fully what tragic
loss your country and the whole of humanity have .
suffered." More than 60,000 West Berliners stood . ye

WORLD REACTION TO ‘THE ASSASSINATION
OR’ PRESIDENT KENNEDY

(Information as of 0700 EST)

SUMMARY ; ’

The governments and the peoples of the world ae
expressing, from East and West alike, their shock
and regret at the assassination of President John
F, Kennedy.

Some governmental reaction has reflected con-
cern over the impact the President's death may have
on international relations--with Latin Americans, for
example, wondering whether the Alliance for Progress
may lose some of its impetus. Some African leaders
noted President Kennedy's strong leadership for
racial equality. The immediate reaction of TASS
yesterday was to attribute the death to American
right-extremists.

The scheduled joint US~Japanese economic and
trade talks were perforce cancelled when the Cabinet-
level US delegation ordered its plane home a short
distance out of Honokulu. West German Chancellor
Erhard has cancelled his scheduled visit to Washing-
ton. He was to have left Sunday. The UN observed
a moment of silence yesterday and adjourned.

Soviet and satellite military activity is at
normal levels. Shortly after the announcement of the
President's death, certain elements of the Cuban

_ armed forces were placed ona sneaeneantd ner

SINO-SOVIET ORBIT: DINAR

ore

Moscow promptly reported President Kennedy's assas-
sination to its foreign as well as domestic audiences.
Soviet reaction sofar has been highlighted by broadcasts
of official condolences at the highest level. Khrushchev
and Brezhnev, the official Soviet head of state, have
sent wires to President Johnson expressing heartfelt s+,
sympathy. to the American people for the loss suffered by
the “heinous assassination," Foreign Minister Gromyko
also sent a telegram to Secretary Rusk. In an unusual
gesture, Khrushchev and Madame Khrushchev wired personal
condolences to Mrs. Kennedy.

Pravda reportedly remade its frontpage of 23 Novem-
ber to carry a column and a half of biographic informa-
tion on the late President, together withaa two-column
picture. Pravda recalis his speech of last June at Ameri-
can University as marking a new, favorable phase in US- —
Soviet relations. Pravda also carried a TASS report not-
ing that Dallas commentators "are linking this crime with
the activity of ultrarightwing organizations." President
Kennedy's steps in the direction of improving the interna-
tional situation are said to have met with "sharp attacks .
from the American wildmen."

Western observers in Moscow can recall no previous
occasion when Soviet condolences on the death of a West-
ern figure were so expressive and given such prominence
by Russian media.

Khrushchev returned to Moscow from the Ukraine and,
accompanied by Gromyko, went to the American Embassy to
pay his personal respects to Ambassador Kohler. This
gesture appears to have no precedent.

Moscow and other bloc media have so far avoided any
public mention of Oswald. Intercepted Czechoslovak mili-
tary communications refer to the President's killer as a
"radical."

The US Embassy has reported that Oswald and family
had difficulty obtaining Soviet exit visas. When he ap-
peared at the embassy in the summer of 1961 seeking re-
patriation, Oswald stated that he was "disillusioned"
with the USSR. He claimed that he had never applied
for Soviet citizenship.

Moscow and satellite radios have apparently dropped
scheduled programming and featured solemn music inter-
spersed with news. Several East European leaders, includ-
ing Tito and Ulbricht, sent official condolences to Presi-
dent Johnson.

The news of Kennedy's death came too late for
Peiping's morning papers, but Peiping radio has carried .
news reports of the assassination. \.
