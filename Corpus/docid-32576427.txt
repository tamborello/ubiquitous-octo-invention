Re Bureau teletype to Los Angeles, et al,
dated 1/18/65.

On the night of 2/17/65, LA 4448-C-TE furnished
the following information:

Informant had just been to the residence of

NICK LICATA, "Under-Boss", Los Angeles ' 'Familia" While
there, Licata mentioned that FRANK DESIMONE , "Boss" >
Los Angeles ' Familia” 2, ad not been in contact with him
since DESIMONE's trip "back east". LICATA appeared to
be somewhat irritated about this. He then told informant }
that he had just been contacted by "The Boss" from the if
San Jose, California area and that this individual said ig
that he hae to see DESIMONE, personally, about some ca

important matter. He then requested LICATA to make contact
with DESIMCNE and arrange such a meeting. LICATA did not,
at this time, identify this "Bogs" by mame. He has
nesviously, however, identified JOSEPH CERRITO as "Boss"

 
  

‘ the San Jose group, La Cosa Nostre. and JAMES LANZA as
"Boss" of the San Francisco group, La Josa Nostra. It is,
therefore, presumed that he had reference to one of these

 

two individuals. ZF
