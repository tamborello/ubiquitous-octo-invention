prospects, but nothing positive has resulted as the
Lucayan Beach Hotel is still under construction. He
related it is generally felt that some of the hoodlums

in the Miami area will be employed in the casinos or hatels
before next year. According to his sources WILLIAM

G. BISCHOFF (Miami file 92-98) is presently in the Bahama
Islands, ! looking over the possibilities and situation.

He said most of the hoodlums feel»that their element will
have some interest because of the close association of
LOU CHESLER with ALLIE HARRIS, MICHAEL COPPOLA and others.
He pointed out that LOU CHESLER's daughter married ALLIE
HARRIS' son. ‘This source stated the racket element is
aware of the alleged restrictions placed on the issuance
of a gambling casino license in the Bahama Islands but
feel that may be just on the surface and that their
contacts will see that they are taken care of.

MM 509-C-TE and MM 665-C have stated some rumors
have begun to circulate concerning transportation by air
and boat to the Bahama Islands. MM 673-C has stated he
heard some comment that PETE DE MET, of Coral Gables, and
WILBUR CLARK, of Las Vegas, have been talking about ))
purchasing some airplanes. MM 665°C stated a boat owner
at West Palm Beach, Florida, who operated a barge service
Some years ago between Key West and Cuba and Puerto Rico
has been talking about establishing a commuter type boat
service from West Palm Beach to the Bahama Islands.
