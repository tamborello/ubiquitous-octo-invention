-or’ less ago Made a trip to the Soviet Union ete on the

Youth Conference Know as the ‘World ‘Youth Conference.

He will probably emerge: from the New York thing as a~

full time organizer im some special field suchas youth. w u

At the start of the Meeting Genne: brought out
her brief case full of clipbitigs (Newspaper) etc she .
also had a lot of pemciled notes which she was ;
undoubtedly going to use to show what she was doing -
_and.to give others hell for not co-operating with her. eH u)

But the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around .
the late Pres. Kennedy. "4 u)

Arnold explained that since Oswald was Considered a
Communist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode
against the C. party of America but by the time the
recactionaries were getting started it was announced
that it had been disclosed that it seemed like the
extreme ight had been active. This was bore out

by the declaration of Russia that it was not the

Cc. party that had done it beacause Kennedy was a

friend of the Working class but the work of the extreme
right or almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober
the masses that it was the same caliber of people who
had insulged Stevenson only Weeks before in Dallas,
Texas. q nN

 

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S, News about this
Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he.
told them he gets lots of letters of enquiry about the
G. party and he probably answered it as he does hundreds
of others and even sent him literature if he requested
it. They (C.B.S.). wanted him to go on the air with 4
statement but he stated. to them he would have to dig the*
letter out and<be.sure before he Made any statement. —
Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson if when he got back to
New York-to look in the files if he had a letter from 4
Wm Pokas, formerly from Bellaire, Ohio, and also afi

asked Johnson to compare the letter of Pokey's with:
Oswald's to see if they didn't haye a lot: in ‘Common.
Palmer stated that he thought the statement’ by’ the
Methodist Minister: Covered the situation very: good
when he stated that the fact that the Murder. of Bill
Moore, M Edgar Evers and others inthe. south, going
by without punishment had set the stage for the ©
Assassination of Pres. Kennedy. Everyone readily

agreed, Ki u)

Arnold Johnson further stated that no real Marxist -
Could do such a thing. There is not Much doubt that
since the Soviet Union had expelled him by not
giving him a Citizenship im the Soviet. Union: because
they thought him to be an Agent of Fascism. Genne’
Meanwhile was Chomping at the bit trying to get her
story told about the N.A.A.C.P. and CORE. Hu)

)

She finally got her Chance to mies GA

She stated that about the tims of the Civil Rights
March on Washington a few days before she had been
working with CORE and NAACP the reporter from the
Wheeling paper Intelligencer had Called and wanted
to talk about her. She gave'him answers on the
phone and finally hung up on him. from the time -
this phone conversation was completed She had been.
quoted in the newspaper and exposed as a. Communist
party Member, which brought about her. expo@lsion from
the. N.A.A.C.P., but since has been restored to
Membership. Then lately 4 Man (Negro) by name of Johnson
head of the local CORE group was indicted for robbing a
bus driver in Steubenville, Ohio.. Genne had got in
touch with R. Gorby as she thought Johnson was being
| framed. Gorby found out and told her at this Meeting
that he had did the robbing amd was Not being framed.
The best thing to.do stated Gorby was to give. him
help but do not put<CORE.and the NAACP out. om a limb
by doing it. u) ; :
