DN 249-C reported on 7/3/63 that during the last week
in June, 1963, he received a long distance telephone call from
DOLAN who stated that he was calling from the State of New
Jersey, but furnished no other information as to his whereabouts.
DOLAN told the informant that he and some of his associates
whom he did not identify, were having a “beef” with ROBERT

_ PIERRE FETONTI, FBI #459907 and that as soon as they found

“ FETONTI "it would be the end of him". : Se

: DOLAN attempted to secure from DN 249-C the current
address of FETONTI, but the informant told DOLAN that he had not
seen FETONTI for two years and knew nothing concerning his
whereabouts. Informant stated that DOLAN furmished no more
specific details to him, but he got the impression that DOLAN
and his unidentified associates, had the intention of doing.
bodily harm to FETONTI. if they located him. He stated the
call was prepaid and undoubtedly BOLAN used either a fictitious
telephone credit card number or a telephone upper housing key to
make the. call since DOLAN considerably used these methods to
make long distance calls without paying for them.
