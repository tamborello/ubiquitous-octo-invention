This interview of ALLEY gave the interviewing agents
no reason to believe that ALLEY is being untruthful. Any
impression in that regard which might have arisen from the
original interview is believed to be dispelled by the following
observations:

This reinterview of ALLEY afforded interviewing agents
a further insight of ALLEY's personality which it is felt may
now be safely characterized as one of extreme introversion.

_ Therefore, while the reaction to the first interview might have _
raised a question as to the degree of his cooperation, after the
present interview interviewing agents were more of the opinion
that ALLEY's personality is such that even. when ‘completely
cooperative he_appears to vasive_ or holding ‘back. X
believed thatgif BARCHALINE] and/or Soviet stfene fates

 

  
  

i attempting to cultivate or develop ALLEY thatxthe latte?
introversion and general lack of a warm personality would have been
i sufficient reason to abandon such a course of act ioi pa :

As an indication of ALLEY's complete disinterest in
subjects not associated with architecture, he stated at the outset
of this interview that he had not thought about the first
interview until the arrangement was made for the second. interview.
He said that he had been working night and day on an architectual
project which had been assigned to him plus* the fact that he was
recently married.

wim Following this statement by ALLEY the secondary
: . plan of approach as outlined in,myerep was pursued. Pe was advised
that the identity of (the Sovietf/ had been determined and by
innuendo he appeared to be ressed with the fact that his
association with({the Sovie ould have more serious
connotation than he had formerly believed The remainder of the .
interview was conducted with this thought foremost in ALLEY's
mind. It is believed, therefore, that ALLEY has furnished all

we tene information within his best recollection. |

In the final ara would appear that because of
ALLEY's negative attitude<pinig ack of moral einess and
€intelligence potential, ¥that LAV ABARCHALINES ho was
merely screening ALLEY / dropped bine)

Because of ALLEY's nature and personality, Chicago
did not question him specifically regarding the points raise
by the Department of the Navy (outlined in Bulet to Directd#of
Naval Intelligence dated 2/27/61). However, the Bureau may’
wish to advise ONI, with its dissemination of this report, of
the following observations and information gained from this
interview which have a bearing on these points.

 

As evidence that ALLEY and his father do not enjoy
a close relationship is !ALLEY's lack of knowledge of details
of his father's employment and the erroneous impression that
his father does not possess security clearance.

It would appear unlikely that ALLEY's father is
aware of his son's activities because of the latter's negative
attitude and the fact that he had assigned no importancesto, his
association with [Ene Soviet ap Copenhagen .

 

Finally, as to whether ALLEY influences his father,
it is the opinion of interviewing agents that ALLEY's personality,
which is far from domineering, would militate against this
possibility.
In view of the foreg » Chicago feels that ALLEY |
does not possess any immediate informant r (dou le agent potentia
Further, since he has indicate is desire to feooperate with this
Burgau in the event Of any corréspondence or subsequent contacts
| by [Soviet personne t is not believed that any additional
interviews or, furfher investigation of ALLEY is warranted and this
case is being closed,
This report is classified confidential Since it reveals
the Bureau'sXinvestigative interes infa representative of a
foreign diplomatic establishment.
