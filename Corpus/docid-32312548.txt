"Jim Chirstianson then said that, he can no longer accept
without question the positions of the SiW.P. Now, he said, that
the S.W.P.. has accepted Pabloism it has also accepted an
incorrect position on the relationship of World Forces.

"He said that scihce he has taken the position that he feels
that he must be organizationaly independent.

"Excactly what is ment by torganizationaly indépendgnt!.
wansn'it made. clear it” seemed that’ he ment that he would remain
a Troskyite but would not be a member of the S.W.P. or have
any thing to.do with it." :

In conjunction with the above, BS 811-S on 1/6/6h provided

a typewritten letter he had received from PHYLLIS SAWYER
reporting on the 12/30/63 SWP meeting. It is noted that: while-
BS 811-S did not attend this meeting, PHYLLIS SAWYER and her
husband ALAN did. This letter is signed by SAWYER and is being
routed to 1A of 13-193.

BS 811-S has provided reliable information in the past and

the utmost care must be utilized in paraphrasing this informa-
tion prior to dissemination in order to protect his identity.
This letter, in part, stated as follows:

"Youth Report: The YSA is continuing to maintain its mem-
bership at 4 time when many campus organizations have
folded-- Student Péace Union, Young People's Socialist
League, etc.--dus to their loose structure, flabby ideas
and in some instances, state of shock because of the
assassinaticn of the President. .

"Most of the membership of the YSA has been recruited since
1960 and most of that since 19621 :

"Chicago: This is one of our most dynamic branches due to
the devotion of its youth. ;

"In order to be considered a contact of the YSA or the party,
~ you must be selling Militant subs and making financial ‘con-
tributions.

"The people recruited thus have served an apprenticeship and
are solid. 23 people were recruited in this last year.
