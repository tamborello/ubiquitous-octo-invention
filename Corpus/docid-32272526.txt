In Book V of the final report of the Senate Select
Committee to Study Governmental Operations on the performance
of the intelligence agencies in the investigation of the
assassination, : the FBI and CIA are criticized for their
apparent failure to fully pursue leads surrounding the
assassination of President Kennedy and then to fully report.
to the Warren Commission the results of the investigations
they did undertake. One such lead concerned the travel
from Texas to Mexico City of an unidentified Cuban-

American on November 23, 1963, and then his flight to Havana on
November 27. 1/ The lead was made more "interesting" by

the fact that the Cuban-American reportedly attended a vn...
meeting of the Tampa chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee on November 17, 1963. 2/ The House Select

Committee on Assassinations examined the documents connected
to that lead to determine: (a) whether the facts which were
known by the FBI and CIA about that individual warranted
further investigation and what investigation, was} undertaken; :
(b) whether any of that. information waS reported to the Warren
Commission; and (c) whether the known facts suggest any

involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy.

A chronology of the activities of the FBI and CIA
on this lead amplifies the information which was in the

possession ¢ the two agencies.
CIA Investigation

The first information on the travel of the Cuban-
American appeared on December 3, 1963. At that time the
Mexico City Station of the CIA sent a classified message
to CIA headquarters that a source identified as LITEMPO/4 had
requested of the Mexico City Chief of Station at 1300 hours
on that date "urgent traces on U.S. citizen Gilberto P.

Lopez."

3/ The source said Lopez arrived in Mexico on

November 23 en route to Havana and that Lopez had

disappeared with no record of his trip to Havana. According

to the message, Lopez had a tourist card,carrying number

24553, which he obtained in-Tampa on November 20, 1963 and

his passport number was 310162. The message stated that Lopez
left Mexico for Havana on November 27 via Cubana (Airlines).

The classified message listed the cryptonym LIFIRE as the

source of information on Lopez's travel. It indicated the Mexico
City Station had no traces on him. 4/

In another classified message dated December 3, 1963 from
the Mexico City Station to CIA headquarters, the station
reported also that the FBI office in Mexico City had been
advised by Mexican authorities that Lopez entered Mexico on
November 27 at Nuevo Laredo. 5/

Cuban- American...page 3

In another classified message dated December 4, 1963

to the Mexico City Station from CIA headquarters, the Agency
reported that the State Department check on Lopez had produced nothinc
yet because of the difficulty in tracing records using only
a name and passport number. 6/ The message contained this .
paragraph:

We assume you have not told LITEMPO

that Lopez flew to Cuba on 27 November

because you do not want to blow the

LIFIRE operation. This problem is up
to you. 7/

The LIFIRE operation referred to in the classified message

to the Mexico City Station involved cooperation between the

CIA and Mexican federal officials who participated in a

plan of photographing passengers of flights departing for Havana
and obtaining the passenger lists of the Cubana flights.

Mexican officials also had their own program to photograph the

passports of the passengers arriving from Havana. 8/

On December 5, 1963 the Mexico City Station reported
that the LITEMPO/4 source had stated that Gilberto Lopez had
crossed the Mexican border at Laredo, Texas on November 23,
1963 and registered in the Roosevelt Hotel in Mexico City on
November 25 at 1600 hours in Room 203. 9/ LITEMPO also
