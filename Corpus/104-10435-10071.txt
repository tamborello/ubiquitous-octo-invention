, OCTOBER 1950

Early in October 1950, DIMITROV visited the Lavrion Camp where he met

with a number of his Bulgarian friends and advised them that he had been
given a "charter and instructions", by certain members of {
[| to forn a committee of five mémbers: for the planning and execu-
tion of a fight for the liberation of Bulgaria. This committee, according
to. DIMITROV, would be established in Athens and would cooperate with other
similar committees which have. already been formed in France, Germany, and
other countries. The committee would later expand to 20 members and would
establish a so-called "Democratic Agrarian Bloc". Recruits would come from
“among the members and sympathizers of the Bulgarian Democratic Party

(Moushynov) and from the Gichev Agrarians. Eligible Bulgarian emigres

would come to Greece from Western Europe. to assist in the work, and pre

organization.

a. Intelligence activity in Bulgaria.

b. Organization of an underground resistance
movement in Bulgaria, and

c. Organization of sabotage activity against
Bulgaria.
