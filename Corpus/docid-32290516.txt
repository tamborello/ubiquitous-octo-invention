in so-called "open territories." They discussed the men on

this commission who would side with GIANCANA on the matter in
question. ACCARDO related that GIANCANA could count on VITO
(GENOVESE), JOSE PROFACI, and JOE BONANNO frem New York,

Philadelphia with JOE IDA, Buffalo (unnamed), and JOE

ZERILLI from Detroit. It was said, "Since the commission

has 12 men," GIANCANA,; according to ACCARDO; needs “seven i
for a majority, six for a standoff." ACCARDO then went —
into the past and said that the men «whem he recalled as being '
part of the commission were PROFACI, STEVE MAGADDINO, PETE
MAGADDINO, VITO, JOE IDA; ZERILLI; TOMMY BROWN; JOE BONANNO,
and RAYMOND from Boston (RAYMOND possibly Boston Top Hoodlum |
RAYMOND L. S. PATRIARCA, aka, of Providence, R.I.) BONANNO, |
according to ACCARDO, "Must have taken ALBERT!s (ANASTASIA)
cut so you put three men on one of them being BROWN's son's
father-in-law." GIANCANA said, "They don't put him on because

he was ‘an official'." . ‘ . :

; Relative to JOE IDA, PH 251-c (deceased) on 10/8/59

boss" with DOMINICK OLIVETTA of Camden, N.J., being the ‘under
boss." This informant has previously described the territory
involved as roughly covering portions of New Jersey, Eastern
Pennsylvania, and Delaware. When IDA departed, the informant

Mafia. It was also stated that. MARIO MAGGIO, older brother
of PETER MAGGIO, has been a member of “the organization" for
some time. ‘

For evaluation, it is pointed out that PH 251-C
(deceased) furnished reliable information for several years
concerning the Italian underworld. This informant has been
a close personal friend of many top echelon rpagket figures
in the Northeastern United States, particularly the Philadelphia
area.

 

In regard to JOSEPH IDA, mentioned above, it is pointed
out that it is known through information developed by the
Legal Atteche in Rome in connection with the investigation
of FREDERICK J. TENUTO, aka, that IDA has taken up residence
permanently in Rome and has given up his American citizenship.
PH 251-C has indicated that IDA made this move because of |
the prosecution of figures whe attended the meeting in Apalachin,
N.Y., in November 1957. This informant's information was
confirmed in part by information set forth in the "TENUCA"
investigation in letter from Legal Attache, Rome, to Bureau
dated 9/13/60. This letter set forth an interview of CHARLES
LUCKY LUCIANO in Naples, Italy, 9/7/60. LUCIANO indicated
that GUISEPPI IDA (JOE IDA) had fled the United States for the
purpose of escaping a "bum rap" in connection with the Apalachin,
N.Y., meeting. LUCIANO stated IDA and other "boys" had engaged
lawyers to help fight charges against them in connection with
the Apalachin meeting but did not believe that this would be
successful and would not return to the United States because he
believed he would be arrested and prosecuted.

Set forth in this report under date of 11/25/60
will be information indicating that BRUNO has ‘been elected

to "the commission" by his own admission. Further, it is
developed in this conversation, which is between BRUNO and :
POLLINA, that POLLINA has lost favor in "the family" because of
some unknown action on the part of POLLINA in connection with
"a meeting" in Wildwood, N.J., at an unknown time in the past.

Verbatim translations of POLLINA and BRUNO's
conversation was furnished, thé Chicago, Miami; New-York, and
Newark Divisions in 4 "JUNE" letter dated 1/12/61.
