Dear Mr. Attorney General; Ur. line
Enclosed is a photocopy of an article which was published,’
by the Denver Post on December’ 28, 1969. TI have been
requested by the Denver Post and friends of Dr. Riha, 3
who is a constituent of mine, to do everything possible asax
to assist in either locating the Professor or in determin- eis
ing additional facts about his disappearance. Boi

It seems to me that the interest of the nation in general SE28
and the credibility of the FBI in particular is not well. S82 fg.
served by the proliferation of a belief that Professor Riha gas
is the victim of some kind of international intrique, if e338
such is not the case. e298

Despite the implications found in the Denver Post article, S8ks
I think it is quite possible that Professor Riha left es
‘ Boulder because of domestic complication: STEORN: EY-GEINES ‘a
