Reference Bureau letter, 9/9/66.

Referenced letter requested WFO to determine whether

the individual employed by the telephone company who
furnished information to SA WILLIAM D. CAMPBELL con-
cerning the telephones of CHARLES WHITE, had knowledge
of or was in any other way aware of the cooperative ser-
vices rendered by the telephone company to the Bureau,
particularly with regard to security matters.

The individual who furnished such information is WF 1401-58
(J, FORD KELLEY, Division Commercial Manager). He does
not have knowledge of telephone services furnished to

WFO at the field-office with regard to security matters.
However, WF 1401-Sidoes make arrangements for telephone
Services furnished to WFO cit yPh connec with{lookouts

 

maintained throughout the cityPn connection with in-
vestigations conducted in. th€ security field.

A high-level official of the telephone company has
expressed the opinion that if an official, gf the company
were subpoenaed to testify concernings information which bv
was supplied to WFO in confidence, it Wouldhave an
adverse. effect on the cooperation which thé telephone
company renders to this office. : In“view: ofthis fact,
WFO feels that every effort should be made to obviate

~s e necessity of having a telephone company official

v

testify in this matter.
