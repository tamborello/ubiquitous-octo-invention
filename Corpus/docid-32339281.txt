It is obvious that GIBSON has discussed the AHC ge
with RENE RAINDORF and/or JACQUES GRIPPA of the Belgian Communist
Party (BCP) and it appears that he has-a,»message for the AHC

from the Belgians. It would seem likely that the Belgians

have disclosed the identities of CG 6547=S and CG 5908-S to

GIBSON even though he states he has no phone number for the
Committee. Therefore the following letter was sent to GIBSON,

c/o General Delivery, GPO, New York City on 9/14/67, in order

to effectuate meeting with CG 6547-8:

Sept. 14th
. Dear Comrade,
. . I received your letter of the 1llth-Call me at 752-3638;
if I don't answer give yourcnumber to my answering service and I
will seach you-
Comradely
(To be signed with the first name
and initial of CG 6547-8)

The Bureau will be advised by the most expeditious
means the results of the meeting with GIBSON.

1. The following information was acquired by Source from Dan Watt
editor of the New York-based Afro-American militant magazine. Liberator

2. San Francisco is one of the few cities in the United States wh
the SNCC leadership is fully integrated, i.e., including both Caucasians
» and Negroes at the effective leadership level. .

 

3. In this area SNCC is concentrating on developing a draft resistance
campaign, with large demonstrations planned on this theme late this month
(September 1967). Because the draft draws in larger measure on Negro

 

    

    

  

 

inductees (Watts said most white draftees are usually more easily able to
“+ secure deferments on the basis of continuing their education), the _ campaign _

Dear Comrades, —

This note is being written urgently from Brussels
to inform you that I will be shortly visiting the States
again and would like to see you on some matters of urgency.

I deeply regret that none of you were able to stop
in London when you visited this part of the world. In
any case, I believe that a discussion at this moment would
be extremely useful in view of coming events.

I expect to be in New York on the 14th and i5th of
this month. A message can reach me, c/o General Delivery,
GPO, New York, N. Y¥. 10001 or c/o LIBERATOR, 244 East 46th
Street, New York, N.Y. 10017. Just when I will reach
Chicago, I cannot say, but expect. thatwill be in the
two weeks afterwards. Would you please let me know how
te contact you when I do get to Chicago, as we have no
phone number or other rapid contact for you.

Fraternally yours,
