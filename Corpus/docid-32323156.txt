CALDERGN had burned some handbilis that MEDRANO had given him.
He burned them because the handbill read something like this:

“MEBGAR EVARS, President KENNEDY and four ; ;
Little innocent little girls gave their Tye Nee
lives, will you give your vote?" ;

CALDERON did not approve of EVARS being listed first.

the President, he knew him.
