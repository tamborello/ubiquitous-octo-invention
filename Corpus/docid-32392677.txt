CRITERIA FOR SELECTING SUBJECT(S) FOR PHOTOGRAPHING

2. .. . If the target is unknown and/or a previous |
photograph has not been taken, the observer takes one.
At the same time he records the time of arrival/
departure, whether the target is known or unknown,

and records any obvious identifying data such as .
license plate, apparent nationality, apparent occupa-
tion, etc. In addition to the above general visual
surveillance, the agents are occasionally provided
with photographs of targets the Station believes

might visit the compound and on whom we wish a speci-
fic alert - such as visiting agent personnel andithird |
country subversives known or believed to be in the

area.
