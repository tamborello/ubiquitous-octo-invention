with him on 8/28/69. DILUGLIC stated MANACCHIO said he
was "confused as to what action te take" and when he.
took care of sone personal matters over the next two
weeks, he planned to surrender to the FBI. DILUGLIO
stated that MANACCHIO is quite ‘concerned about effect of

‘publicity regarding case on aged mother and brother,

Dr. ANTHONY MANACCHTO, obstetrician at Rhode Island ws
Hospital, Providence. DILUGLIO contended he did not know

RAYMOND JOSEPH PATRIARCA, Providence, R. I.,

Zn of subject PATRIARCA, contacted 9/4/69 and agreed to
Pavel to Atlanta, Georgia, and discuss fugitive status
é MANACCHTO and VENDI with father, currently incarcerated

 

c Atlanta Federal” Penitentiary. RAYMOND JOSEPH stated
ve feels that "heat" generated by the FBI in fugitive
investigation is reflecting adversely on father and other
Subjects in this case, stating that certain unnamed
eitizens in Providence now are saying that "FBI must have |

good cage or MANACCHIO and VENDI would not have run."

RAYMOND JOSEPH also stated he hopes his father will okay
"Dassing word down to Providence" to have subjects surrender
to FBI in order to quell such talk. This aspect of investi-
gation will be followed closely... : .

Investigation concerning subject VENDI is being
centered on cooperation béing given Bureau Agents by close
members of VENDI's immediate family, located in Seekonk
and Fall River, Mass., and Barrington, R. I. Extensive
background information developed concerning VENDI and
leads set forth at Jacksonville, Miami, and Orlando, Florida,
where subject recently traveled on vacation and possibly
has business interests. Both of subject's ex-wives indicate
they will turn subject over if he makes contact. Also,
subject's brother, Deputy Chief of Police MIKE VENDITUOLI,
Barrington, KR. I., who at first was uncooperative in this
matter, is now fully cooperative with Bureau Agents, and
