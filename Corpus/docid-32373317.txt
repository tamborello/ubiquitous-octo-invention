“ 2, During the time COHEN was a CIA employee {1949-1963}, he
was of concern to the Security Offica, due principally to the activities ;
and proclivities of hia wife, Rita C. Heller COHEN, #MS-3185, the form
mer wife of Irving ROTH, #MS-2001 R. COHEN was the subject of an
Employment Review Board case in 1956; and in 1956 waa disqualified
23 a member of the Junior Career Devslopmert Program. It was then
decided to put him on a job in F'BIS in which he would not be exposed ta
highly sensitive material. At the time of his resignation, he was an
i, O. Contact, GS-14, in the Chicago Office of the DDI/ Of Contact
Division, ‘

13. In January 1965, the DCS requested approval to contact
COHEN on an ad hoc basis to participate in the briefing and debriefing
of his employer, Senator PERCY, who planned an extensive tour of the
Far East. In June 1967, Mx. George CARY, Logislative Counsel,
requested a check on COHEN stating that there may be occasion to brief
him from time to tima. According to Mr. CARY, COHEN would be
briefed generally on the build up in Cuba but would not ba exposed ta
cperational information or exctic material.

 

18. There is attached a cepy of the above referred to September
articies in Life magazine, in one of which CAIN is described as tha erste
while chantfeur and courler of Sam GIANCANA. The second of these
articles makes reference to alleged friendly contacts of Jim GARRISON,
of the OSWALD Case, with henchmen of the Sosa Nostra in the Leuistana
area,

_ 1. Reference is made to the attached 5 June 1967 DCS ma...
randum on Subject, which in turn made reference to previous DCS
memoranda on him on 24 and 25 May 1967 and to an Office of Security
memorandum dated 29 May 1967. The 5 June 1967 memorandum
enclosed copies of several 1963/1964 documents from the Chicago
Field Office’s file on CAIN, which ADC/PSD forwarded to SRS with
the comment that "It appears DCS ie cleaning out their files re Lee
Harvey OSWALD, et al." :

 

2. Subject, it is obvious, had been a source of information |
regarding an alleged discussion of the assassination of President
Kennedy at a secret meeting of the Fair Piay for-Cuba Cammittee
held in Chicago in February 1963 under the direction of Richard
CRILEY (#346 116). He also was the source of information regarding
the alleged attempted recruitment into the Communist Party of young

" Cubana in the Chicago area by one Guillermo ESCOBAR, who accord- __.
: ing to the Chicago office was "one of Horace SPEED's (SAS) leads

i obtained from Ralph PEREZ." (Presumably Ralph PEREZ, #444260)

j SPEED is Horace SPEED ID, #199499. The documents also indicated

: _ that in February 1964 CAIN was the subject of a conversation initiated’ .;
{ , by Eldon & COHEN, #38557 o/c, with a representative ofthe DCS =“

3. During review of SAIN's Security file, I noted a message
regarding him from Mexico City, on 25 April 1962 ,which mentioned
a" Willard ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico,"
who obviously had had contact of some kind with CAIN, as well as with
a CIA representative in Mexico to whom ANDREWS had commented that
CAIN claims to have been with OSS during W. W. IL (copy of this memo-
randum is attached). In answer to this message which requested traces
on CAIN, Headquarters, in furnishing limited information obtained regard-
ing him, advised that neither hig claimed employment by OSS, nor a claim
he made to have worked with Task Force W, could be substantiated. The
Station was advised that he did have {or had had) a legitimate detective
laboratory in Chicago.

4. With reference to Willard ANDREWS, Security indices contain
ne record. I believe the individual referred to is Wyllys ANDREWS,
(Edward) \yllys ANDREWS IV, #2769, a former CSS/CIA employee who
has lived in Mexico for many years and has continued to have social con-
tacts with representatives of this Agency in Mexico as well as with Agency
employees from Headquarters who visit him from time to time. ANDREWS,
like CAIN, was born in Chicago of parents who also were horn in the general
area of Chicago. :

5. The firdtime CAIN came to the attention of the Security Office
was when the Mexico Station requested traces on him. Their request
stemmed from an unannounced visit he made to the Station, during which
he stated that he had an investigative agency in Mexico with branches in
Chicago and Los Angeles. He had also stated that his agency in Mexico
was for the purpose of training Mexican Government agents in police
methods, in investigative techniques, and in the use of the lie detector;
and had added that he was investigating Communism in a certain unnamed
Central American country.

6. In June 1962, the Mexico Station advised that CAIN was being
deported by the Mexican Ministry (of) Gobernacion for these violations:

a. Carrying a loaded revolver and brags knuckies
b. Impersonating a Mexican Government official
(He had identification as an investigator for the

Mexican Treasury Cffice. )

Violating his tourist permit by working at his
detective office and at the Mexican Treasury

-7. Subject was subsequently of interest to the DCS in September
1963 when an ad hoc clearance was requested to permit his being asked |
te respond to general requirements regarding his knowledge of certain
Guban refugees and their potential for foreign positive intelligence. On
10 September 1963, the DCS was sent a memorandum which furnished
much of the above information on CAIN. ,

8. On 22 May 1967, the Director of Security indicated thet he
had received information from the FBI which ties Subject to the Mafia
in Chicago; and he directed that the DGS be contacted for information
as to whether or not they ever established contact with him and, if so,
for what purpese. The DCS was also to be advised that, if they were
in centact with him, it wae suggested that they break it off. On 25
May 1967, the DCS advised that there had been no contact with CAIN
since 1963, and furnished copies of eight reports for which Subject had
been the source of information. These had to do with anti-Castro Cuban
activities, procurement of arma, etc. :

9. On 29 May 1967, Security advised the DCS that there is a
current FBI investigative interest in Subject and recommended that
there be no further contact with him at this time.

" 10. The 1 September 1967 copy of Life magazine contains an
article titled Brazen Empire of Organized Crime," in which it is
stated that Sam GIANCANA, Head of the Chicago Cosa Nostra, is " still
running things by remote contrel from a hide-out in Mexico. . . where
he poses as Riccardo SCALZETTI. The real SCALZETTI, GLANCANA's
eret while chauffeur and courier, is more familiar to Chicagoane as
Richard CAIN, a well known former Chicago policeman and more recently
& private investigator, "'

li. Eldon S. COHEN who is mentioned in paragraph Z of this
memerandum as having evidenced an interest in CAIN during the guber-
natorial campaign of the now Senator (from Illinois) Charlies H. PERCY >
#178329 and #EE~-21773, is now PERCY's Executive Assistant. COHEN,
whe became employed by PERCY in J anuary 1964, following hie resigna-
tion from CIA which was effective 31 December 1963, at the time he con-
tacted a representative of the Chicago Office of DCS regarding CAIN on
10 February 1964, did nct indicate that he was amployed by PERCY. He
said, rather, that he'd been adked hy the "PERCY for Governor!’ people
to inquire as te CAIN's status.
