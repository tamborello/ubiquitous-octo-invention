On March 24, 1964, cv-344-c was contacted by
SA FRANK G. DOUDS and. he displayed a letter from GUISEPPL
PINDILLI dated March 5, 1964, In this letter, PINDILLI
wrote that he had written to his good friends, JAMES
TRIPODI, Steubenville, Ohio, ANTHONY RIPEPI, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, thanking them for the help they had given
his. son when he had been in a little trouble. He also
mentioned that he wanted to be remembered to FRANK
De AUGUSTINO, Cleveland, Ohio, and FRANK -MEZZATESTA,
Kent, Ohio, and that he was grateful for the $100. 00
check he had received,

 

cvV-344-c stated: regarding MEZZATESTA he knew
that he had tried to get a nephew into the country on y
a quota; and not succeeding, he had him come to this
country on a'visa; and to prevent his going back to
Italy, he had arranged a marriage through DOMINIC MOIO
while he was working with the NAPIES brothers and ‘
HOLOVITICH in Youngstown. He stated that previously,
from his father, he learned that MEZZATESTA had been
greatly respected in the "organization" and a man who
could be trusted. MEZZATESTA, he said, is very close
to JAMES AMATO, Shenandoah, pennsylvania, who attended ©
the funeral of ALBERT ANASTARU in New York. He :
stated he would call on MEZZATESTA and attempt to
determine MOIO's connection with the CAVBOMB case,
but’ he pointed out that if he could call on him with
his father, GUISEPPI, he would be assured of all the.
information in the possession ef MEZZATESTA including
MOTO's part in the CAVALIERO killing, if he was involved
in the fatal hombing of BILLY NAPIES which occurred prior
to that and in which MOIO had to have been involved.

cV~-344-c stated he was again writing his father
and will mention CHARLIE CAVALLARO and his murder and
will advise any background of their association which
his father may supply later by letter.

cv-344-c made a photograph of GUISEPPL PINDILLI
available to SA DOUDS, as well as the letter he had
written from ARGENTINA-on March 5, 1964, and this is being
