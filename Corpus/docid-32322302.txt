Title: JFK TASK FORCE

Synopsis: Work anticipated by the N.O. Division

Reference: Numerous telephone conversations in May and June,
1996 between Carol Keely, Judy Bowen, Warren Jung, and Elizabeth
Nemeth. fo
Details: This communication is to advise the JFK Task Force what
steps the New Orleans Division will take before forwarding the,
requested documents to the task force. ie

New Orleans will inventory and prepare a list of all
Title III transe¢ripts. As each box of transcripts are
inventoried, they will be forwarded to the Task Force so that
they can be copied. New Orleans will make a copy of the Title
III logs and forward these logs to the Task Force since a copy
must be maintained by the New Orleans Division (these are our
only copies) for retrieval purposes should New Orleans be
required to respond to other requests regarding this case.
Transcripts found for consensual recordings will be forwarded to
the Task Force for copying.

UAC by JFK Task Force New Orleans Division will proceed
as set out above.
