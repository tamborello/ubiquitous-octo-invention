on how to £111 out his "application". . The informant was of the
opinion that this application was an application for registration
with the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor. Both GLEASON
and NOONAN advised ENGLISH, not to put down that he was arrested
or indicted and that he-should take his ‘chances that he can get
. by the Waterfront Commission's “screening. They pointed out
_ that if ENGLISH. got caught, “that was that".

NOONAN explained to GLEASON that he intends to call
Yale Transportation Company and-M & M Transportation Company to
try to.get a job for ENGLISH. NOONAN stated “I will call Gene
(ph) and then Pat‘ Everett (ph)". NOONAN made-a telephone call and
asked for GENE. SULLIVAN (ph).- Apparently when he was advised
that SULLIVAN was-not in, he asked for RED BARNEY. It is noted
that RED- BARNEY is employed by Yale Transportation Company,
and it is. further’ noted that in March, 1963, NY 1716-C advised
that a (FNU) SULLIVAN, the son of FARMER SULLIVAN. an. ex-convict,
is a-shop steward. at Yale Transportation and-is one ‘of JIMMY ALO's
men, : . .

NOONAN was unable to get either” SULLIVAN: or BARNEY
and then called PAT EVERETT and arranged to. send ENGLISH over
-on April 10 to get. ‘a a job with M & M Trucking Company. -

From ‘a review of the indices of the NYO, it was
determined that MATTHEW ROBERT ENGLISH is one of the subjects of
NY File 15-26106.. Discussion. withthe case agent of this file |
indicates that ENGLISH is due to appear in USDC, EDNY on May 20,
and that FRANKIE DOTO is involved in some manner in this case.
A: recontact will be made with NY. 3778- CX by the agent handling ~
this informant and the case agent handling NY File 15-26106.
Any additional information obtained through this recontact will
be furnished to the Bureau.
