TARANTINO said he remembers a small boy in Boston
who lived back of his own home and he recalled the incidents
ROSSELLI mentioned. He said he never knew this boy's last
name and when ROSSELLI said, "I'm JOHNNY ROSSELLI", he
assumed it was ROSSELLI's true name. He has not seen
ROSSELLI since 1925, nor has he heard anything concerning him.

‘ TARANTINO said he lived with his parents at 100
. Cottage Street, . East Boston, from about 1910 to possibly

1914 and that "ROSSELLI" lived around the corner on Maverick
Street. Both families lived on second floors. TARANTINO's
father, MATTEO TARANTINO, operated a barber shop at the

. : Cottage Street address and had a pool'hall in the rear of

; the barber shop, while he lived above the barber shop.

: TARANTINO knew nothing concerning ROSSELLI's family.

LINWOOD REEVES, garage rking concessionaire,
Friars Club, Beverly Hills, on 5/16/66, advised that on
Tuesday, 5/11/6 6, he picked up ROSSELLI at ROSSELLI's ; :
apartment. ROSSELLI had a suitcase and a top coat. He

took ROSSELLI to the office of Dr. VICTOR LANDES in Beverly

Hills and waited for him and then took him to within one

block of Doheny Drive and Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills,

where ROSSELLI left the car.

The office of JAMES CANTILLON, ROSSELLI's attorney,
is located in the Gibralter Square Building on the northwest
corner of Doheny Drive and Wilshire Boulevard. REEVES said
ROSSELLI mentioned nothing concerning his plans. He said
he has not seen ROSSELLI at the Friars Club since 5/11/66.

‘A review of school records by the Boston Office
did not disclose a Maverick Street address for the SACCO
family, but this may be because PHILIPPO SACCO was not yet
_in school.

Boston investigation per airtel to Director,
11/12/64, reveals MATTEO TARANTINO, a barber, resided 100
Cottage Street from 1910 to 1912.
