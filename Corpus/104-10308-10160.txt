information reported in paragraph 1, b above, However, the similarity

of the titles is obvious, and the tentative identification of the composer ;
lends additional credence to the Station's suspicions regarding the unusual
nature of the intercepted conversation. Headquaters would appreciate
receiving any further information which SWHOP-2 may be able to develop
on other conversations between "Alfonso" and his Cuban counterpart, as
well as any comments or information which Mexico City may be able to
provide on the personalities mentioned in reference.

For Your Information

1. The following information was obtained from AMMUG-1 when
questioned concerning his knowledge of songs used in radio communications
in connection with reference:

a.. When GPIDEAL died "AUGUSTO" personally came to the National
Liberation Building and held.a meeting with the officers of that section. He
instructed those individuals who maintained communications with organiza-
tions of their respective countries, as well as with some agent, to prepare |
a system of communication using some song, lecture, commercial, etc.,
which could be transmitted by Ridio Havana, Cuba, and could be used to send
easily understood ciphered messages.

b. AMMUG-1 believes that Norberto HERNANDEZ Curbelo chose
the musical recording of "Las Seis Lindas Cubanas" {Six Beautiful Cubans),
or something similar. He believes this song was written in the 1920's by
Antonio Maria ROMEU, who leads his own orchestra; however, the song
was made popular by the "ARAGCGN' orchestra during the "Cha Cha Cha era. "
(Comment: ROMEU is approximately 80 years old and undoubtedly is identical
with the individual referred to as Antonio. Maria ROMERO in reference. }

2. "AUGUSTO" or "Agusto" was previously identified by AMMUG-1 as
Deputy Chief of the DGI, and is probably identical with Carlos Sixto CHAIN
Soler, Deputy to Manuel PINEIRO, ,Chief of the DGI.

3. It is not known whether there is any connection between the gong
titles mentioned in reference as "tres lindas Cubanas" and the AMMUG-1
