The Honorable William J. Clinton
President of the United States
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. President:

For the reasons set forth in detail in the enclosure,
this letter requests that you exercise your authority, under
Section 9(d) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act of 1992, to postpone the public disclosure

. Of three documents and a photograph ordered released by the
. Assassination Records Review Board.

Consistent with the spirit of the Act, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has cooperated extensively with the
‘Board and made the broadest disclosure of documents in the
Bureau's history. In this. instance, however, release of these
items would severely invade the privacy interests of three
private citizens and subject them to public ridicule and
embarrassment with no discernable contribution to the public's
understanding of the circumstances surrounding President
Kennedy’s assassination or how that crime was investigated by the
FBI. We are particularly concerned that the items, which have
been marked “OBSCENE” for good reason, may be published on the
Internet and will be available to minors following their release
to the public. Moreover, we have been able to warn only one of
the three persons whose character and reputation will be
besmirched by the release of these items. The one person we have
contacted strongly opposes the Board’s decision to release this

PETITION FOR -POSTPONEMENT
UNDER
SECTION 9(d)
OF THE’
PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY
ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992

This petition requests, on behalf of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), that the President exercise his
authority, under Section 9(d) of the President John F. Kennedy

postpone public disclosure of three documents and a photograph

The Board’s determinations concerning disclosure of
the information in question are set forth in a letter dated July

attached at Tab,B. Under Section 9(d) of the Act, the President
has the nondelegable authority to require postponement of
disclosure under the standards set forth in Section 6 of the Act.

The Standard for Postponement

. Pursuant to Section 6 of the Act, disclosure of
assassination records’ or particular information in such records
may be postponed if there is clear and ig Convincing evidence that:

(3) the public disclosure of | ‘the assassination
record could reasonably be expected to constitute
an unwarranted invasion of personal’ privacy, and
that invasion of privacy is so substantial that
it outweighs the public interest .

The Senate Report on the Act provides no guidance with respect to
the standard set forth in Section 6(3) .3

1 44 u.s.c. § 2107, note.

2 Defined by Section 3 of the Act to mean "a record that is related to

the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, that was created or made

.» any Executive agency... ."
