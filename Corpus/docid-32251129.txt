With the exception of two documents, all the material on Lawrence
Howard, Jr. was either known to us or of such little value that a

review of the file contents is not warranted. The material was gathered
largely in relation to the Garrison investigation of the assassination
of President Kennedy.

New information on Howard was supplied in Document #7189, Section 179.
A synopsis follows:

Wyoming County, New York, whom Capwell has personally known for the past
five years and believes to be stable. Margeson supplied his information
to Capwell on April 14, 1975.

' Margeson stated he was living in Los Angeles in 1962 and met Lawrence
Howard, Jr. who was collecting funds for anti-Castro forces. Howard
went to Florida Keys for six months and returned late in 1962 with
Rudy Hernovdez and unsub (sic) aka "Slim", a white male, 5'6" - 5'9" in
his 20's. All were employed by Jack Casey to paint and refurbish the
old Union Temple. Through these people, Margeson met a man called
"Tex" who arrived from New Orleans late in 1962 or early 1963. He
described him as a hit man, in his late 20's, 5'6" - 5'g", slender,

135 pounds, former military and a rotten disposition. He furnished his
name as Lee Harvey. Margeson came forward with the information after
seeing a TV documentary regarding the Warren Commission which said
Oswald was in Russia in 1962-1963.

Additional information on.Howard was contained in File #62-109060,
Section 160, #6498. It involves an interview with Richard G. Lubic
after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Lubic was closely
associated with Kennedy during the California primary and travelled
with him.

The interview with Lubic was.conducted on June 25, 1968. Robert
Kennedy was assassinated on June 4, 1968. -Lubic. states that Stephen
Jaffee, of Jim Garrison's staff, contacted him in May of 1968 trying to
arrange a meeting between Garrison and Kennedy, the purpose of which
was for Garrison to warn Kennedy of a possible attempt on-his life.

Lubic worked through Frank. Mankiewicz to set up a meeting, but Mankiewica
later reported that RFK was not interested in meeting Garrison.

The FBI report (56-156) to the Director, from SAC, Los Angeles, was
titled KENSALT. According to Lubic, Stephen Jaffee related a con-
spiracy story to Lubic who, in turn, asked him to repeat this information
to Ron Buck, a Los Angeles attorney and partner of Pierre Salinger in the
operation of The Factory, a night club in Los Angeles. Jaffee claimed
that "The-Committee”" had placed $10 million in the hands of a secondary
group to locate appropriate individuals to carry out the assassination of
John F. Kennedy. He claims Edgar Eugene Bradley and Lawrence Howard were
members of this group. According to Jaffe, Jim Garrison claims "The
Committee” is composed of National States Rights Party, Anti-Castro Cubans,
oil depletion interests and persons opposed to the U.S. policy of rap-
proachment with the Communists.

This conspiracy story of Jaffe's is similar to the one this Committee
has received from Lila Hurtado, aka LIBRA. Ron Buck figures prominently

in the LIBRA claims of a conspiracy. Jaffe's and Hurtado's reliability
need to be checked if there is any interest in pursuing this angle.

the Sylvia Odio incident. This document had a notation that a five-page
memo, designated Top Secret, Third Agency, had been deleted.
