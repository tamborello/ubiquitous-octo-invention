‘Pursuant to Mr. Thuermer's request to provide

Mr. Gorey of Time magazine information on Agency efforts

clarifying whether or not there was an October 10, 1959
flight from London to Helsinki, Agency records indicate

a message was received dated 24 June 1964 which reflected
that there was a direct flight from London to Helsinki

on 10 October 1959. It was FINNAIR Flight 852 which
arrived Helsinki at 2333 hours. This information was
passed on July 1, 1964 to Representativé Rankin. . Efforts
to ascertain if there. were other more circuitous flights
from London on that date were explored without apparent
success.
