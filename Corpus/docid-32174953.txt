@n April 20, 1970, a check of records of New
HOSKINGS was bora Gcteber 8, 1928, ia Bt. Kitts, British
West Indies. He arrived in the United Kingdos in 1956.
and resides with bis wother at 16, dap Road, Wiebledon,
London. &.¥. 19. In 1969 he waa arrested and convicted
for theft and as of April 27, 1970 was about to be ar-
vested again by Metropolitan Police, Londen, for lnrceay
of money from hig employer.

On April 24, 1970, Detective Sergeant FRED
PARIGH, New Gcotinad Yard, London, interviewed HOS INGS
st his residence, Be described HOSKINGS ac a white anle
with West Indian accent. He bas persisted in saying to
the police that he was not well enough to stand trial
for his present offence of larceny from his employer and
it is believed that the letters he Kage written to the °
¥.U.1, at Washington and Dallas, ag well as lettere to *
American Gebessy, Londoe, U.8. Aix Boreo Remdquarters,
England, and Hew Scotland Yard, London, have all bees aa
attezpt on hig part to say that be hag been cooperating
with New Scotiand Yard and the 7.8.1. im solving major
exises, which be hoped would net in mitigation for his
current offense of larceny from his employer.

When interviewed by Sct. PARISH, he professed
intimate knowledge of #11 the current majer crimom ia Londen,
ineluding a kidmaping and murder case and an esplomage case
currently being tried. He aise claimed to have been a member
ot the Mafia sent to Eneliend.

if

Sergeant PARISH is of the opinier that because of
subject's mental inctability he thought he might be immsdi-
ately brought to the U.S. te aepist U.8. authorities, thus
saving himself from being arrested and sentenced in Londen.
