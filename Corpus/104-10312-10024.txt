... fPeter Houckfas a witness at which time

16M th 1976 |

SUBJECT: Gordon Novel

1. ir. Peter Houck] resident officer for DCD in New Orleans,
telephoned to say that additional problems regarding Gordon Novel
had arisen andr. HouclJrequested that I call the Assistant U.S.
Attorney, Mr. Al Winters, telephone No. (AC 504) 589-2921. On
16 March I called Mr. Winters and he told me that Novel had posted

_ $40,000 bond and had been charged with possession of a destructive

device. However, as they investigated the case there seemed to be
more evidence of a conspiracy with other business associates of Gordon
Novel, particularly with regard to acquisition of fairly sizable parcels
of land in downtown New Orleans including land in the French Quarter.
Mr. Winters indicated that his office was beginning to collect evidence
of suspicious fires which had occurred on some of this property. Mr. |
Winters estimated that the earliest trial date for Gordon Novel would be
late May or early June. . :

2. Mr. Winters asked that. Houclf not discuss the case with .
Gordon Novel or any of his attorneys. Obviously, Mr. Winters is
concerned that such discussions could lead to "Jencks material! and
I assured him-that it was the Agency position that we did not want{Mr
Houck}talking to any of the defendants or their counsel unless a
representative of the U.S. Attorney! s Office was present.

r. Houckican deny the Agency's
approval of Novel's proposal "Project Morningstar , " A second possibility
is that CIA would have to provide a witness from the Office of Personnel

3. It.would appear at this time ot: Gordon Novel may subpoena

to show that Mr. Novel was never employed by CIA,

4. On March 16, I called[Mr. HouclJ and explained to him Mr. Winters'.
request that he not talk to any lawyers or defendants and(Mr. Houclfreadily ~

" agreed to comply with this request and said that he would immediately call

Mr. Winters if any attempts were made to interview him.

ATTENTION =: [Erais Hate]
SUBJECT : Gordon Hichael Dusie Hovel
REFERENCE  : HH-27696, 10 Decenber 1975

1. IT have reviewed the allegations in reference that the
British, either British military or British intelligence (other-
wise not further specified), have cutfitted a converted World
War I] Liberty ship as a floating display case for British
military hardware. 1 have further checked out the bizarré story
in paragraphs two and three of reference concerning use of the
British ship by MI-6.

2. This office has absolutely no information to substantiate
the story told in reference and Africa Division also has no
corroborating information.

3. In short, 1 consider the story developed in paragraphs
two and three of reference highly suspect since I do not believe
the British would be able to mount such an operation without it
coming to the attention of this office.
