trips to Czechoslovakia in the past,and hoped to make
another trip in the«summer of 1962, It is possible
DOUGLAS may have been-instrumental in channeling the
tuo deposits of $5,000 -and $5,500, a11 in $100 bills,
into the FPCC bank account in April, 1961, inasmuch
as there was some indication that these $100 bills
might have: come from a source in Czechoslovakia,
