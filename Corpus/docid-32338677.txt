During his Bh, contact with LAWSON, La 3402-s
received a definite impression that LAWSONhas coaled .
considerably toward the trip to Cuba. LAWSON indicated
that the Cuban spokesmen do not really have much to offer there a
and he again stated he would much rather go to Europe anatead. (9/V(1/

In regard to the possibility of a. European trip
by LAWSON, informants have developed nothing concrete as
yet. In this comhection, however, the following information
received from LA 3932-S on 7/1/60;. may be the basis for
LAWSON's neater: GU) European trip at an unspecified

time in the future. a ‘
gechow
LAWSON was present at a meeting of the :

Council of. the Professional-Cultural Section, Communist
party (CP), Los.Angeles on 6/21/60. Part of the business
of that meeting was a discussion concerning the possibility
that section council members JOHN H. LAWSON and LESTER
COLE (Bureau file 100-2230) were giving considerable thought
to spending sometime in eastern Europe. Apparently this
stemmed from the fact that Mrs. JEAN PESTANA, Attorney ;
and member of the Section Council, (Bureau file 100-389985)
was then visiting in eastern Europe and had written back ..
that. the Communists in Czechoslovakia were interested in
having intellectual Communists from other countries visit
Czechoslovakia; that there agears to be a considerable
difference between the attitude of the Russian Communists
and that of the Czechoslovakian Communists toward outside
intellectuals; that where-as the. Russians feel Communists
should work in their own countr#gg,the Czechoslovakians
feel there is great need for inteflectuals and specialists
in Czechoslovakia at the present time and therefore welcome
such people, in Prague. u

. Both LAWSON and COLE indicated that they have |
good connections in’ Czechoslovakia. Both indicated their i
desires to spend sometime, possibly a year, there if it }
