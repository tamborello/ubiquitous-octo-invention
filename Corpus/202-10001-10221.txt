CONSIDERATIONS

 
 
  

Possible future use im communications and support.

Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose
of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions
controlling these factors. If the recruitment and train-
ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit-
ment and training will be much less difficult than if
they are limited to intelligence -collection purposes
only,

There are “colonies” in Washington, 6.C., and other
U.S. cities which are “little Cubas. Family, Church,
and business interests provoke unusuai.personal ties
inside Cuba for some of these residents; a real potential
exists for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail-
able. {FBI support and coordination is basic in thig
effort.)

As Opa-Locka becomes fully activated, CLA will ae ‘
other interrogation center as promptly as feasibi ae

center ie being activated in Spat Negotiations

local authorities are being undertaken to activate centere,
if possible, in Mexico City, Caracagy San
Juan, Puerto Rico, and Santiago, re being sur~
veyed for possible centers, (CIA r. wibility with sup-
port by others as necessary. }

CONSIDERATIONS

There is a risk that this action will disclose this U.S.
intelligence activity wilhin Cuba. Selected personnel
are being intensively trained. This firat team has Z
agents. An area in which resistance has been reported
hae been aclected, Agent operations must slay alive,
make useful contacts, and report securely to CIA.
Physical risk to personnel is substantial, due to lack
of intelligence. First reports from firet team are
expected by the end of March, while reports from the
second and third tearns, digpatched in March, are ex-
pected to start in April.

Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained
for paramilitary skills as well as intelligence collection,
with the thought that they will be in place inside Cuba
and ready to act whenever paramilitary operations are
decided upon. However, CLA has noted that, once the
agents are inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled
effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort +
will be made to atternpt such control.

These staff intelligence officers may also be used in the
future for communications or agent handling, if future
developments warrant.
