On 3/8/61, PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III, as
follows: . . _

- Recently, one RALPH THOMAS, no other identifying information,
took about $2,000 worth of knives, forks and other utensils, all
made of aluminum, to KELLY MANNARINO in Florida, reason unknown.
There were too many for.MANNARINO.to use in his home in Surfsie,
Fla., so KELLY must have a restaurant or other outlet there.

SAM MANNARINO recently visited Florida, and while he was there
he did not stop to see his brother, KELLY. This probably means
\ that they are still feuding. . _
