15. Section III/2-smerican Consul General Hong Non Comments Qn Pelping Reaction

16

To President Kenredy's Death:

Comment: There is 4 distinctive defensive note underlying Chinese Communist
com entary, which the im ConGen believes can be attributed to Pelping's
realization that except for Corr unist China and s scattering of adherents,
the whole wrld(including the USSR) has joined topether in mourning the loss
of President Kennedy and in wishing President Johnson well, As so often 13
the cise when Petping fcels itself isolated and on the defensive, og. .
regarding Soviet charges that the Chinese Conmmunists advocate war as 4 meuns
of world revolution, Peiping in this instince feels oblired to vilify its
chosen enemies inordinately in order to justify its extreme stand. Insofar
ae leeal Chinese reaction is concerned in Hong Kong, the ConGen contacts
think this line will prov oke adverse affect even among Communist adherents.
What effect such treatment will have on China mainland remiins to be ane.
Meanvhile, we surmise that Peiping senses it will have consider ible difficult
4n shifting its propazanda attacks away from President Kennedy to his
successor, who is unknown quantity due to regime's technique of using hte
Presidnet as the personification of all that it hates in us.
