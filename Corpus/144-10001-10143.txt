Dear Jim

_I am forwarding a letter from a former Security Service member. to you.
It was furnished to us by the recipient,. through his commander, at one
of our subordinate units.

After realizing the- impltecabtans, true or otherwise, we immediately

_ notified our unit commander to turn it over to the OSI in Florida,
believing they would contact the Federa? Bureau of Inyestigation,
since the writer is a civilian now.

Yesterday, this office was contacted by an OSI agent a Lowry AFB, CO;
this agent happens to be an ex-Security Service man. He was instructed
“by his headquarters to interview the writer of the letter to determine
_ the names of other individuals he had contacted. Apparently. Mr. Christen-
“sev has a- long history of alcoholism, family problems and now wants to
see a "cleared psychiatrist" as he attributes all of his problems fren
Oct 1963, per the OSI agent. In addition, he has indicated to the OST
that hee now fears for his life.

 

I-am furnishing this to you as 1 fee} the implication in the letter
should best be handled at the national level and that ycu are in the

best position to contact the Bureau. I have no knowledge that OSI has
not done this, but in view of the fact the subject was interviewed es

a civilian by an AF agent, rather than an FBI agent, leads me to doubt
this. In addition, you are in a much better position to determine where -
the nearest psychiatrist, with access, is. located. For your informetion,
we Blagee the classification markings on the letter.

 

We were told “by ir. Coombs, the OSI agent at ost District 14, that the
doctor to contact at the VA hospital in Cheyenne, WY is a.Dr Seadel,
commercié? celephene number 778-7550, extension 273.

Warm regards
