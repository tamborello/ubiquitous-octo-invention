"World Marxist Review" also referred to as
"World Marxist Review-Problems of Peace and Socialism",
and "Problems of Peace and Socialism", mentioned in
the enclosed LHM, has been subject to past inquiry in
Bufile 105-71639 and NY 100-137025.

CG 5824-S advised on 11/15/73 and on 12/15/73
that PHIL BART (Bufile 100-3284) (CV 100-1207) (NY 100-56579)
and his wife, CONSTANCE BART (Bufile 100-6885)(CV 100-21637)
(NY 100-12959), recently returned to NYC from Prague
where he represented the CPUSA on the editor board of
the "World Marxist Review"; that JOHN PITTMAN, whd might
now be seriously ill, volunteered for the job since it
would give him an opportunity to secure expert medical
aid in Prague. Further, that his wife, MARGRIT PITTMAN,
wants to go with him, but she wants to live in Berlin,
East Germany, only a one hour flight from Prague, where
she could act as a "Daily World" correspondent.

CG 5824-S advised that the CPUSA is apprehensive
about MARGRIT PITTMAN's "petty bourgeoise nationalistic"
feelings for the East German CP which cause her to put
down the CPUSA. Further, that the CPUSA feels that she
must be restrained from dominating her husband, and that
if she goes to East Germany, that Party, must be told
that she is not a representative of the CPUSA in East
Germany.

CG 5824-S noted on 1/3/74 that MARGRIT
PITTMAN, a naturalized US citizen, born in Germany,
has strong feelings favorable to the East German CP;
and, that her daughter, CAROL PITTMAN (Bufile 100-
450605) (NY 100- 164468} is a college student in East
Germany. On 1/3/74, (NY 2705S\advised that CAROL CXL)
PITTMAN, who visited Her pevrefits in NYC during the
summer of 1973, is reportedly still studying in East
Germany.
