Re Miami letter to Bureau 1/11/67.
Efforts to locate SANTIAGO in Miami have been —

unproductive. He has space in the Ainsley Building, Miami,
under the name of SAM BENSON and Associates, however, it
would appear to be a front, since there are people in this
office only on rare occasions. Messages have’been left

| : with the office for SANTIAGO to contact the FBI Office in
Miami, however, these messages have gone unanswered.

In view of the above, this matter is considered

closed.
