It has been mentioned previously to the Bureau
that MORRIS JOSEPH STARSKY as a public employee is known
to be of interest and concern to JACK WILLIAMS, Governor

ROBERTSON (NA), Assistant Superintendent, Arizona Highway
Patrol.

As a general rule copies of reports or LHMs in
security type cases are not disseminated by Phoenix to the
AHP. It is recommended that the Bureau authorize Phoenix
to furnish ROBERTSON one copy each of the enclosed LHMs
captioned as follows:

1. “"SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY, STATE OF ARIZONA ,"
dated 8/16/68 at Phoenix, Arizona.

2. "PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY; NEW PARTY, STATE
OF ARIZONA," dated 9/10/68 at Phoenix.

Se of MORRIS JOSEPH STARSKY but also of other individuals con~
ety nected with ASU and wi\th the University of Arizona, both

Remylet, 7/1/68.
1. Potential Counterintelligence Action

MORRIS J. STARSKY, by his actions, has continued
i. to spotlight himself as a target for counterintelligence
action. He and his wife were both named as presidential
wy electors by and for the Socialist Workers Party when the
SWP in August, 1968, gained a place on the ballot in Ari-~
zona. In addition they have signed themselves as treasurer
and secretary resnectively of the Arizona SWP. Professor
STARSKY's status at Arizona State University may be affected
by the outcome of his pending trial on charges of disturb-
ing the peace. He is alleged to have used violent, abusive
and obscene language against the Assistant Managing Director
of Gammage Auditorium at ASU during memorial services for
MARTIN LUTHER KING last April. Trial is now scheduled for
10/8/68 in Justice Court, Tempe, Arizona,

A recommendation for counterintelligence action
as to STARSKY will be submitted by separate letter,

The status of captioned program in the Phoenix
Division as of 7/1/68 may be summarized as follows:

, 1. Potential Counterintelligence Action

 

It was mentioned in Phoenix letter of 5/31/68 that
MORRIS J. STARSKY, as a public employee, is understood to f
be of interest and concern to JACK WILLIAMS, Governor of a
Arizona, There are now indications that as a result of C
this interest, which is by no means a matter of public record
and is unlikely to become such, the Board of Regents, which
exercises administrative control of the State universities,
may soon find cause to separate Professor STARSKY from the
public payroll. It is considered that he may have falsi-
fied attendance records or something of that nature. STARSKY's
dismissal from the ASU faculty could be expected to disrupt
New Left organizations at Arizona State University and in
the Phoenix area generally.

In any event, Phoenix will explore means of assur
ing that Mr. WILLIAMS is cognizant of the rol® which STARSKY
and others in the ASU Philosophy Department play in keeping
the New Left alive within the State of which he is Governor,

ReBulet to Albany, 5/10/68, copies to all offices,

|

i On the basis of developments to date, it is apparent

| that New Left organizations and activities in the Phoenix
metropolitan area have received their inspiration and
leadership almost exclusively from the members of the faculty
in the Department of Philosophy at Arizona State University

i (ASU) ; chiefly Assistant Professor MORRIS—J.,-STARSKY,, The

fn ~
LoGaily are thercfore pretty chvious.

STARSKY in presently the subject of active invest-
gation in the Selective Service category, as is DONALD W,
GHISCHEN, also an Assistant Professor of Philosophy s- 77
Background information which is thus developed may prove
useful for counterintelligence purposes. Bureau authority
is also being requested to initiate an active security
investigation of WILLIAM MONROE WINGFIELD, who is a Graduate ~2_.
Assistant in the Department of Philosophy.

pal STARSKY has already received considerable publicity

7 in Phoenix papers in connection with his anti-war and anti-

‘ draft activities. It is understood also that Governor JACK
WILLIAMS is well aware of STARSKY's radical proclivities and
has privately expressed concern about him. This suggests an

}/ avenue of counterintelligence approach as well as that offered
; by reliable and cooperative contacts in the news media.
