was reportedly run by an individual known as Richard Davis. ,
(FBI Memos 4/6/67, 5/15/67) ,

To our knowledge, no information has been
received from CIA concerning the alleged
training camp or Richard Davis. An FBI
memorandum of March 3,:1967, reported that
the Bureau files contain no information indi-
cating that Oswald had any connection with
Davis. Davis has been described as a pro-
moter and a hustler, who will do anything for

, - money, and is often carried away with his own
wt, thinking. (149-4801) . So

6. Garrison has charged Gordon Novel and Sergio Arcacha
Smith with the burglary of the Serumbérger Well: Service Company's

_ munitions bunker in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, in 1961,
Garrison evidently believes that some of the individuals in-
volved in this robbery (Hovel, David Ferrie, Smith, and several
Cubans) were also involved in the assassination and that a panel
truck used in the robbery was-used in the assassination. Gordon
Novel reportedly contends that he was employed by CIA, was act-

- ing for CIA, and that the burglary of the munitions bunker was
not; an actual burglary. Novel reportedly contends that CIA had
an arrangement. with Schumberg
and other material in the ammunition bunker; that Schur

_ became upset over the Bay of Pigs invasion and wanted to get out

 
 

 

er to
be taken out by Novel and his 6roup. Novel has indicated that |
he and Sergio Arcecha Smith are still employed by CIA. Novel {
has stated that in the event he is returned to New Orleans to i
face charges of burglary, this will be his defense. (FBI Memo h
4/24/67) Novel alsa claims that he once operated the Evergreen b
‘Advertising Agency as a front. for CIA communications and thet :
funds were channelled to him by -CIA, (FBE Memo 4/27/67) Gordon i
Novel's attorney also stated on May 25, 1067, that Novel worked !
for the CIA in early 1961, serving as an imtermediary between }
the CIA and anti-Castro Cubans in Mew Orleans and Miami before i
the April 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. The attorney, Steve Plotkins, :
