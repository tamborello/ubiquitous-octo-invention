ADMINISTRATIVE (continued)

authorities relative to the recent arrest of the subject

for Attempted Extortion. GRAZIANO. stated that GRANELLO

and his associates are "all washed up" and he, GRAZIANO, Ke
has "nothing to do with them".

The informant was of the opinion that GRAZIANO
remains in close association with GRANELLO and is skeptical
concerning the reports that -GRAZIANO will testify against
GRANELLO., The informant added that he expects/GRANELLO
will endeavor to "fix" the charges against him.

 

 

The informant further commented that several years
ago GRAZIANO expected to develop a system whereby commercials
would be played on juke boxes. However, this prospect did
not materialize, but the informant believes that -GRAZIANO
expected to develop this set up with IRVING HOLZMAN , the
victim of Attempted Extortion by GRANELLO.

Due to the sensitive nature of the foregoing
information and the fact that it is mostly conjegture on
the part of the informant, this information has not been
ineluded in the details of this report.

On 8/14/64, NY 4317-¢ ‘advised that he heard from
ETE PETRELLA that the subject owes his life to_ROCKY
(GRAZIANO. The informant is of the opinion that “GRAZIANO
has probably made arrangements for a "fix" in the subject's
pending income tax case.

On 8/24/64, NY 4461-C advised SA PAUL G. DURKIN
that he has not seen the subject in the recent past, but 4
was told that GRANELLO is not at all worried about his :
arrest for Attempted Extortion in Nassau County, NY. ; i
According to the information received by the informant, .
arrangements have been made to. take care of the matter for
the subject.
