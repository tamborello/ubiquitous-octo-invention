“the Russian Language, Russian ‘history, Russian economy.
Mr. Klein. ‘and woula they have any interest in an

American who had strong anti-American views and who was a

professed Marxist? Would they have any interest in that

kind of person?

Mr. Nosenko. Here were are coming to a very interesting!

[
and sensitive question. From mid-1950, by the order of

Central Committee Communist Party, Soviet Union, KGB was
prohibited to make any approachment and recruitment of

!
members of the Communist Party of the West. -

Mr. Klein. I am not asking about a member of the
|
Communist Party. :

|
Mr. Nosenko. Your question is, and if he. is some type

of Marxist here, the question maybe he is possibly a member
of Communist tParty, and to check it for KGB very difficult
if he is a member of ‘Communist Party or not of his country.
Mr. Klein. Would they ask him if he is a member of
the Communist Party?
i

Would they check it?

Mr. Nosenko. No, they would not ask him.

Mr. Klein. They wouldn't ask him?
Mr. Nosenko. No.

Mr. Klein. woutd the Soviet Union be interested in

someone who was in the military and worked with radar equipment?

Mr. Nosenko. It depends. If he was corporal, private,

is no big interest. If he was officer, maybe they would be ,
