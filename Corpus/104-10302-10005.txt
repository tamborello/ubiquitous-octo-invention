JAPANESE ELECTION OUTCOME

The Japanese’ general elec-
tion On 21 November was charac-
terized by a paucity of real
issues and a low voter turnout.
_It brought no significant shift
in the balance between the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
and the leftist opposition.

 

The LDP won 283 seats and
is expected to pick up most of
the 12 conservative "“independ-
ents." Adherence by all of these
nevertheless would leave the LDP
still seven seats short of the
position it held after the 1960
elections. :

 

   
   
   
  
 
  
 
   

On the left, the important
feature was the failure of the
Japan Socialist Party (JSP) to
gain, while the more moderate
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP)
obtained six more seats than it
won in 1960. The Japan Conm-~
nist Party (JCP) now holds five
seats, a gain of two over its
1960 performance.

The voter's support of the
LDP suggests that the electorate
is generally satisfied with con-
ditions and progress under the
Ikeda government. The LDP's
victory falls short, however,

of assuring Ikeda a third term
as party president or of strength-
ening his position within the
party. Intensification of
internal rivalries for position
within the party is certain

‘until precedences among the fac-
tion leaders can be hammered

out. Actual damage to the

party, and to Ikeda's position
nevertheless will probably be
offset by the fact that the lost iu
seats for the most part went iD
to the DSP, while the JSP, the of
real enemy, was defeated. :

A period of critical self-
examination and possible changes
of leadership clearly are in
store for the JSP. Its net f
loss of one seat in the face l
of gains by its DSP and JCP i
rivals may have seriously \
damaged its carefully self-con- |
trived image as the leftist
“wave of the future," destined
to control the government by
1970. Loss of extreme left-
wing support to the JCP may be f
attributed to the confrontation
of the JSP and JCP over the nu-
clear test ban treaty and to
the JCP's pro-Chinese stand.

The JSP's failure to reforn
internally may have influenced
some voters to shift to the DSP.

PEIPING'S ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH NON-COMMUNIST ASIA 0.

 

es ae

Communist China’ s economic
activities in the countries of
non-Communist Asia now are re-
covering from the setback they
suffered in 1960 following the
failure of the "leap forward."

Peiping's 1963 trade with
most of these countries appears
to be above last year's, so the
Chinese probably will earn more
from their Asian trade this
year than they have in the re-
cent past. These earnings will

imports of Western grain--which
presumably will continue at
about last year's level.

China's net export earnings
from trade with Hong Kong, its
largest source of free world
currency, are up about 25 per-
cent over 1962 and are running
at an annual rate of about $250
million. China's favorable
trade balance with Malaysia may
reach about $80 million this
||) year, about 10 percent over the
‘ level achieved last year with
i{ the members of the new federa-
tion. Sino-Japanese trade is
' gurrently at an annual rate of
i) slightly over $100 million--up
| from $84 million last year.

 

China's economic aid proj-
ects in the non-Communist Far
East have been implemented
; slowly in the last few years.
|| Such activities are expected to
remain at a moderate level as

again be used chiefly to finance.

‘The Chinese may, however,
be willing to provide additional
economic assistance to Cambodia,
which so far has utilized about
60 percent of a total of $50
million in Chinese grants.
Peiping responded favorably al-
though cautiously to overtures
from Prince Sihanouk after his
announcement of Cambodia's de-
cision to end the US aid program.
Earlier good-will gestures in-
cluded Liu Shao-chi's visit to
Cambodia last May, followed by
a trip to China by a Cambodian
bank delegation. Recently

construction of a glass factory

Peiping's largest single

Burma, however, has recently
accepted a Chinese offer to
build two bridges in northern
Burma, and there are indications
that formal approval of other
Chinese aid projects will be
forthcoming in the near future.

Eastern Europe is making plans
to prevent a recurrence of the
widespread. discontent and the se-

_ rious dislocations in some sectors
of the economy which resulted fron
last year's severe winter. The
fuel, power, and construction in-
dustries and the railroads were
the hardest hit, and although a
repetition of last year's weather
conditions would be unusual, it
is primarily in these sectors that
preparations are being made. While
there are signs that the other
Communist regimes are making sim-
ilar plans, the most detailed in-
formation is available on East
Germany's preparations.

The East German regime has
already warned that electric pro-
duction capacity again this winter
will be inadequate to meet demands
of all consumers. The shortfall
results from growing industrial
use of electricity, delays in com-
pletion of new generating capacity,
and the low water level available
for power generation. The regime
on 30 September published an ur-
gent appeal to save electricity.
|. It was followed a month later by
announcement of a "competition"
for "power thrift." Throughout
industry power consumption norms
are being established. Production
during night shifts is being in-
creased to make more efficient use
of the hours when power consumption
is normally at a minimum.

 

In the coal industry, the East
Germans have made an exceptional
effort to increase production and
have succeeded in raising coal re-
serves in industry by 5 percent
since last autumn. Measures aiso
have been taken to prevent freezing
of coal loaded in open rail cars

and of rail switches at the 1 mines,
which posed major problems last
winter.

East Germany is easing the
burdens on its railroads by con-
tinued transferal of short-distan
hauling from the railroads to
trucks. New schedules for contin-
uous loading and unloading of
trains and trucks were instituted
on 1 October.

  
     
  
    
 
 

Production in high-fuel-con-
sumption industries such as steel
and ceramics reportedly will be
curtailed or halted as required.
About 60,000 workers would be af-
fected by such drastic measures.

Czechoslovakia also has warned
that electric power output will be
insufficient to meet all needs this
winter, largely for the same rea-
sons as in East Germany. The Czech
began instituting measures to save
power as early as mid-August, and
preparations at power plants were
to be completed by the end of
October.

Both Poland and Hungary appar-
ently are concerned with ensuring |
adequate coal supplies for the do-
mestic market. The chief of Po-
land's coal exporting agency has
said that the country this year
will export to nonbloc countries
one million tons less than last :
year. This move, along with greater.

plies for the domestic market.

Hungary has announced that
coal production will exceed the
planned level by one million tons
as a result of overtime work, and
that imports of coal will be 1.2
million tons above plan. (SECRET

CUBANS APPREHENSIVE OVER POSSIBLE US POLICY CHANGE

Cuban leaders are appre-

hensivé that President Kennedy's

assassination will result in a.
more "aggressive" US policy. to-
_ ward Cuba.

Fidel Castro's two-hour
speech on 23 November, which he
_ termed an “objective analysis"
of the implications of the |
assassination, warned Cubans
that the President's death was
"serious and bad news." It
could, he said, turn "a bad
situation" into a worse one.
He also asserted that President
Kennedy's alleged promise not
to invade Cuba had been strongly
attacked by those "ultrareac-
tionaries" in the United States
who now are trying to create a
climate of "anti-Soviet and
anti-Cuban hysteria" designed
to pressure the new US Presi-
dent toward a Cuban policy
"highly prejudicial to the in-
.terests of peace and of man-
kind."

Castro stated that he had
never heard of Lee Harvey Oswald
and insinuated that the Castro-
Communist. affiliations of the —
_accused assassin. were fabricated
by.US "reactionaries" who, he
claimed, were the only ‘people

who could benefit from the Presi
dent's death. In this connec-
tion he warned that a “sinister

maneuver" was under way, and

declared "we must be cautious
and vigilant and alert."

Che Guevara echoed these
warnings in a speech of 24
November, declaring that "the
years: coming are going to be
as tough as, if not tougher
than, the years just past...we
must be prepared to repel any
attack." He expressed confi-
dence in ultimate victory, not
only for Cuba but also for
"the peoples of Latin America."

Guevara stressed that the
revolutionary ferment in Latin
America is reaching a climax
and that the people there "are
going to conquer power in what-
ever manner necessary, destroy-
ing. whatever force that opposes
them. He pointed out that)
Cuba's continuing "anti-imperi-
alist struggle" is closely
linked with the coming revolu-
tion in the rest of Latin Amer-
ica. "The'fight of all peoples
is also our responsibility,"
he maintained, “and it is part
of our daily preoccupation."

Moscow apparently has de-
cided to refrain from harass-
ing Allied convoys on the Berlin
autobahn, at least for the time
being. On 21 November the USSR
replied to the Western notes of
6 November which protested tbe

-detention of the US convoy on

4~5 November. The main purpose
of the reply was to restate for
the public record the Soviet
claim that the June 1945 agree-
ment between the Soviet and
Western commanders in Germany
gave the USSR the right to ex-
ercise "protection, maintenance
supervision, and control" on
highways used by the Western
garrisons in Berlin,

The Soviet note sought to
strengthen this claim by stating
that the "harmonized procedures"
conveyed by the Western powers
on 29 October "are in no degree
valid for Soviet military au-
thorities.," Moscow denied
that American authorities have
any right to establish the ob-
ligations and "manner of opera-
tion" of Soviet checkpoint of-
ficials,

The note reflected Moscow's
sensitivity to the point made
in the Western notes contrast-
ing the detention of the US
convoy with the normal process—
ing accorded closely similar
British and French convoys on
5 November which also refused
to dismount. Moscow took ref-
uge in the pretense that
‘these latter convoys were not
challenged because they observed
existing procedures and
"presented taeir.personnel for

checking," whereas the US con-
voy was detained until it agreed
to "go through the same check."

The passage since the 4-5
November incident of five con-
voys of a size. which are non-
dismountable under Allied pro-
cedures, the 16 November Soviet
statement on access procedures,
and Moscow's 21 November note
all suggest that Moscow has
decided to accept a standoff
in the autobahn dispute for the
present, The Soviet procedures
marked a clear retreat from
earlier extreme demands that.all

personnel in convoys of more

than five vehicles are obliged
to dismount, Although the Soviet
procedures are not identical to
the Western "harmonized proce~
dures," the differences are not
great enough in themselves to
give rise to gurther incidents,
The Soviet rules seem to pro-
vide Moscow with a practical
working arrangement not incon-

isistent with normal Western

convoy practices,

In light of the failure
to divide the Allies on the
access issue and the reper-
cussions of the Barghoorn case,
the Soviet leaders probably de-
cided this was not an opportune
time to propose formal negoti-
ations, Their efforts to es-
tablish an exclusive right to
control autobahn traffic, how-
ever, suggest that the Russians
will revive this issue whenever
theyfeel the situation is ripe
for another attempt to bring
the West into a new round of
Berlin negotiations, (SECRET:
