She did not see KEELEY SMITH here, but she said
JOHN J, MILLER used to go with her. There was another :
girl present, but she was drunk and sleeping on the couch
so she never met her. ,

Following the show, the whole party went to the
Hotel Claridge, where they had taken over a whole floor

of rooms.

While here, she had intercourse with FRANK
(LNU), the bodyguard of GIANCANA, and "DOC" STINE.GZANCANA paid the
fee ($50) for FRANK and "DOC" STINE paid $50 for himself. She
then went to sié@p by herself in a room off the living room
of the suite. When she awoke the next afternoon, everybody

alse had left.

She does not remember the names of anyone else
that was present, but it was very crowded and many others
were at D'AMATO's office and the Hotel Claridge. A photo
of ANGELO BRUNO was exhibited to her and she stated she
had never seen him. A photograph of JOSEPH BONANNO
was shown to her and she said he looked familiar and may
have been in D'AMATO's office, but she was not sure.

at the Sea Isle Motel in Atlantic City. She started
hustling out of the 500 Club. WILLIE D'AMAT@, brother of

| SKINNY, tried to obtain $5 for every $25, and $10 for every
$50 she made, but she refused, :

She said the police had a convention in Atlantic 1
\ City and she "entertained" several policemen. One of these

was a PAT VOLPE of the Newark PD and EMILIO DE LEO whom she

also knows as "THE COUNT", paid her for entertaining VOLPE.

"THE COUNT" later took her to Newark where she
lived with another prostitute, DEBBIE YOUNG, 51 Clifton
Avenue, Apartment 2103, Newark, NJ, Here she has met
many Italian hoodlums whom she thinks are in the "Mafia."
She said she has some of their names in her book which
is in her parents' home. She will obtain this book and
furnish the information to the Agents in the near future.

At this party, she recalls, were SINATRA; JACK
E,. LEONARD (comedian); TED STEELE and his wife (disc
jockey); BUDDY GRECO and his wife (entertainer); JILLY
RIZZO and his wife (restaurant owner); HENRY GENNA (connected
with Sands Hotel, Las Vegas); SAM FLETCHER (singer); SAMMY
DAVIS, JR. (entertainer); a Negro girl, name unrecalled,
who accompanied DAVIS; and a "DOC" STINE. There may have
been several other people there whom she does not recall.

Following- this, a number of them, including SINATRA,
SAMMY DAVIS, and the Negro girl, HENRY GENNA, JACK BENANTY,
"DOC" STINE went to the presidential suite, Savoy Hilton
Hotel, where SINATRA was staying. GANDOLFO slept with .
SINATRA and engaged in sexual intercourse with him. The
| next day BENANTY said he put something in her purse for
her. She found two 100 dollar bills in her purse.

During the party at Jilly's, she was told they
were all going to be down at Atlantic City at the end of
the week and she was told to come. She said this was
general talk and nobody in particular invited or enticed
her to Atlantic City, it merely being a general invitation.

SINATRA and several others left that day in his
plane. for Atlantic City. A day or so later she went down,
alone, by bus which fare she paid for herself. :

She arrived in Atlantic City about 7:30 p.m.
and went directly to the Claridge Hotel, but couldn't get
a room as it was full. She checked her bags, changed in
the ladies room and went to the 500 Club. There was a
long line-up outside the 500 Club waiting to get in.

 

BENANTY got her in without waiting and she went
to the bar by herself. After a while, BENANTY came over
to her and invited her into BKINNY D'AMATO's office.
