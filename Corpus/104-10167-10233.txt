1. The referent menorandun reported information fron
a ZRNAHOO intelligence report of a Statement made _by the
Minister-Counsellor (MC) of the Cuban Embassy in

on 24 September 1977, that "Cuban exiles™Such as

AZ L (fnul (sie) and others had been involved in the
assassination of President Join F. Kennedy."") ke believe
that this could refer either to fedro DIAZ Lanz, or his
brother Marcos DIAZ Lanz, formerly Chief and Deputy, Chief,
respectively, of the Cuban Revolutionary Air Force. Both
entered the W.S. from Cuba as exiles in mid-i959. Since
that time the DIAZ Lanz brothers reportedly have been: a
Closely associated with, and. invelved in Aumerous activities
with, Frank STURGIS (aka FIORINIY of Ratergste fame. The
Agency assisted in the evacuation of Marcos, and fedro .
entered the U.S. on his om. Although hoth were debriefed
by the Agency, there is ne indication that they were ever
considered Agency assets. . .

 

2. Station queried source for further infor-
mation as promised in Paragraph 4 of the reference. The
Source said that the MC referred to the Kennedy assassina-
tion during a pep talk to party members to Maintain good:
Security. Further, that the NC said that “recent infor- :
mation had arrived" implicating DIAZ Lan (fan) (sic),
former air force officer, in the Kennedy assassination :
but did not Rention any other Cuban exiles by name or give
any further details, Although the MC did not identify the
source of his information, the Station source had 1b-5
the inpression that the information might have heen included
in a cable from the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The

information from the MC’

 

without jeopardizing his security. :
