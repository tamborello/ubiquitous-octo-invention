GOLITSYN defected during source's period of service with
‘the K.G.B. Source heard about him from various K.G.B. officers

but never met him.

2. With reaard to GOLITSYN's defection, source B id he had butt.
been told in Condon by both Konstantin Tyanovich“2DTOV head of 4u-
K.G.B. Brandi 2. 4teynter- intelligence) there, and Sergey Mik-,

hay lovigh¥CCLUse “tne K.G.B. officer responsible for the S.K.,

that GOLITSYN, whose job in Finland source described as “Branch

2 of something", had clashed violently with: his Resident in

Helsinki. He wrote a number of official and private letters to

Moscow asking that either he or the Resident be transferred.

Headquarters refused to agree this, and when he visited Moscow

threatened that if ke failed to get on with the Resident he

would be in danger.of losing his job. This was too much for

GOLITSYN, so he defected. Source added that this reason for

GOLITSYN’s defection was convincing, and that he had never

heard any rumour that it was not genuine. : ,

following information about the measures

3. Source gave the :
as the result of GOLITSYN's defection: ;

taken by the K.G.B.

(a) He had been sentenced to death; this was stated in
an article in "The Chekist" which appeared some time after
1964. The K.G.B. would try to kill him as soon as they

could find hia.

{b) Within six weeks of GOLUBEV's arrival in London on
12.6.71. he told sourcesthat he had received a telegram.
from Headquarters ordering him to concentrate on obtaining
information about GOLITSYN, (to whom the K.G.8. had given
the abusive nickname UROD), because according to their
information GOLITSYN had visited England several times,

and while they had now established “the place of residence”
they had no approach to him. Moscow required detailed
information about where he was living, his habits and

activities. From the wording of this telegram source : '
deduced that GOLITSY% was not resident in Encland, and

that the object of this order.was to remind GOLUBEY of a

standing instruction that the highest priority was to be

given to obtaining information about him.
