Informant said that Colonel IVANOV stated he
is convinced that NOSENKO defected because of a lack of
morality. IVANOV said it is his opinion that NOSENKO.
planned this whole thing for a long time. IVANOV further
commented that it is especially difficult for him to
understand NOSENKO's actions inasmuch as NOSENKO's father
was a close personal friend of Premier KHRUSHCHEV.

Informant was then asked if it was unusual
that NOSENKO, an employee of the Second Directomate of
KGB in Moscow, should be selected to accompany the Soviet
Disarmament Delgation to Geneva, Switz@land, it being
noted that the specific function of the Second Directorate 1
is to perform counter-intelligence duties against
foreigners in the Soviet Union. Informant replied that
it is not unusual for employees of the Second Directorate
to be selected for such missions. He said that on the -
contrary, it is considered quite an honor among personnel,
of the Second Directorate to get such assignments. He
- said these assignments are eagerly sought and jealously '
-~guaded by those fortunate enough to get them. . As an
example of another employee of the. Second Directorate
who travelled abroad with a Soviet Delegation, informant
cited NIKOLAY RATNIKOW, a chief of a department of the,
Second Directorate, who several months ago accompanied
t@e Soviet Scientific Delegation to the United States.
Information concerning RATNIKOV's visit to the United States
with this delégation has been previously furnished to the
Bureau. : :

of the 13th Department, lst Directorate KGB.

by US authorities for killing NOSENKO inasmuch as NOSENKO
is a Soviet citizen, and that KOSIKOV, in killing NOSENKO .
would not be ons ene a crime against the US or any
eitizen of the US.

IVANOV stated that after it had been decided by cs

FOMIN and himself thatthe above was the best course of

action to follow in this matter, he and FOMIN collaborated

on a telegram which ‘they sent to KGB Headquarters in Moscow
outlining their plan. IVANOV related, however, that one day

(hap they received a reply from Moscow which was signed

(MraDiMiRoy the KGB code name for SEMICHASTNY, the head

of the KGB). ANOV said that in this telegram, Moscow

the proper moment",

 

According to the ‘informant, IVANOV said that the
above telegram was the first of two telegrams to which
IVANOV referted during his conference with KGB personnel.

in Moscow would not allow NOSENKO to be. killed, then it was
decided. that another man from the. Consuldr Group at the .
Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. would be sent to confront
NOSENKO. This man was not a KGB employee, but was "elean",
