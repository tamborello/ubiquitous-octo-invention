INFORMANT COVERAGE:

The following informants and confidential sources
of the Dallas Office are being utilized in coverage of the
subject's activities, associates, etc.

DL-95-C
DL-170-C
DL-140-C
DL-105-C
DL-122-C
PCI JOSEPH N, FERRARI
PCI WILLIAM W, PETREE
JEROME J. CRANE, Confidential Source who is
funeral director handling most of the Italian funerals in Dallas.

Mr. R. A. BURROW, Chief Special Agent, Southwestern
Bell Telephone Co., Dallas - confidential source.

It is believed by the Dallas Office that the
informant coverage of the subject is adequate and should
he become involved in any possible violation of a Federal
statute or should he expand his present bookmaking operation,
it is believed this information will become known to the
Dallas Office through the above informant and source coverage.

A review of investigation conducted to date in
this matter by Dallas and auxiliary offices has failed to
develop any information that the subject is operating across
state lines or is involved in any known violation of any -
Federal statute. Results of this negative investigation
conducted by Dallas and auxiliary offices is not being set
out in this reportibut is being maintained in the files of
the Dallas Office.

It will be noted there is an overlap in the ‘
investigative period of this report due to the fact that
information was received from auxiliary offices after the
submission of the last report.

The extensive investigative period of this report
has been noted by the Dallas Office, however, it was desired
that the submission of a mere status report be avoided and
that investigation requested by auxiliary offices and necessary
investigation at Dallas be completed prior to the submission
of report in order to ascertain if further investigative:
activity by Dallas is necessary in this matter. |
