“> Dear George: Ps

~ Please forgive the delay in my reply to your September 5th letter.

 

- It took time to explore thoroughly the matters you raised... 0%

 

Let me say first that 1 know it must have been difficult for you~”

“to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter. I believe I: °
can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic ~.

_...' death a few years ago and the current poor state of your wife's health. -- —
Iwas extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances. | oo eel

_.. °-In your situation, I can well imagine how the attentions you ;
‘described in your letter affect both you and your wife. However, my ..:
staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your —
activities on the part of Federal authorities.in recent years.’ The —
flurry of interest that attended your: testimony. before the Warren - a
Commission has long since subsided.. I can only speculate that you~
~ may have becowe "newsworthy" again in view of the renewed interest

-- in the Kennedy assassination and, thus, may be attracting the atten- ee

tion of people in the media.
--- [hope this letter has been of some comfort to you, George,:
although I realize I-am unable to answer your question completely.
_ Thank you for your good wishes on my new job. As you can imagine,
I'm finding it interesting and challenging. : - roby :
Very truly yours ;
Georgé Bush

_Director |

. 5. Mr. Helms’ 3 dune 1964 memorandum for the liarren Commission on
the de Mohrenschildts/is attached at C. It describes the Agency's
interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de Mohrenschildt in 1957 asa :.
result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year. Contact Division (now

_ Domestic Coliection Division - DCB) had its resident agent in Dallas,

Nr. J. Walton’ Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschiidt at that time. © The
history of Mr. Moore's relationship with Mr. de Hohrenschildt from 1957 .

' to 1961 is also.attached at C. As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested
traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt. The trace results (attached at D) con--~
tained sufficient derogatory information to preclude. further extensive --
contact with the de Mohrenschildts. (An 0S summary on Mr. de Mohrenschildt

; prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D. . *

 

“6. our files: show that: a mail cover was ‘placed on ‘Jetters, ‘addressed.
to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about’1964 to _
1966: - (This was probably not uncovered at the time of -the external. in- a

_. vestigations.) | This. included opening and photographing the contents of :

... some letters by the CIA Station there. The results of this operation

the Rockereiter ‘Commission investigations. We were asked to respond to: a

‘. memorandum submitted to the Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled "CIA .

Activities. and the Warren sconmiss ton Investigation." Mr. Hoch called for
an identification of Mr..d, Walton Moore's employment affiliation and
asked what Mr. Moore knew about. Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de
Mohrenschildt about him. . Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission is
‘attached at E. : ; ae ; oo. ae

from Mr.'d. Walton Moore who was-contacted in May and Juiy 1976 by writers
‘ connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Diat Press and the Dell.
Publishing Company. Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and _ .
Mr. de Mohrenschildt. Mr. Moore® s reports on these | contacts are’ attached

and poorly connected, and some of his associations in the past have
raised serious questions. Certainly his relationship witn the :
Oswalds has caused him considerable trouble and may nave caused this
Agency and the FBI to\spend more time and energy on him in the past
than was necessary. De co,

interests in.Mr. de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late
1960's. We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could

of President Kennedy. We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond

Mr. Moore's reports. attached at F.. What we can say is that we have
found no indication that either CZA or the FBI has taken any active
interest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent yeays. 9. - PT
