WEEKLY SUMMARY

ALBERT A. FISHER, PCI, advised that he recently talked

to a motel operator on motel strip in Dade Co., Fla., who was
weighing the "pros and cons" as to whether or not he should
pay $400.00 a month year round to some Dade Co. Sheriff
Deputies or a "bag man" for the Dade Co. Sheriff's Office
relative to operating a bookmaking and gambling set up,
without interference at his motel (Miami File 92-812).

MM 665-C related that LOU CHESLER, a millionaire
and a big gambler, recently secured his son-in-law, MEL .
HARRIS, a job with a stock brokerage firm in New York City,
where he reportedly is a customer's man. CHESLER's daughter,
over a year ago, married MEL HARRIS, son of ALLIE HARRIS, a-
hoodlum, who is a gambler, bookmaker and dice game operator,
who was considered part of the MICHAEL COPPOLA group (Miami

File 92-101).

: This source also advised that he had received
information that NICHOLAS DI COSTANZO (Miami File 92-864)
is a close friend of VINCE DE MEO, a contractor, and bankrolls

MM 92-515

MM 509-C-TE advised that MILTON SPITZER's true
name is MILTON SPENCER (Miami 165-211); that SPITZER gave
up the gambling and bookmaking operation at the Miami Beach
Raly Club after two weeks; that SPITZER is now associating
with NAT FARBER (Miami File 92-118) on a daily basis and it
is rumored FARBER is bankrolling SPITZER in his gambling,
bookmaking and shylock operations.

This source also advised that on 3/23/63, JOE
INDELICATO (Miami File 92-404) spent almost five hours with
SAMMY WEISS at the Patio Bridge Club, Miami Beach, in an
effort to secure a loan of $25,000 from WEISS. INDELICATO
was heard to say that he could nottake "No" for an answer and
was heard pleading with WEISS for the money. Near the end
of their meeting, WEISS finally agreed to loan INDELICATO the
money. Comment was made that INDELICATO needed the money
because he was in bad with the "boys" up north.

MM 509-C-TE also advised that WILLIE BAKER, operator
of a gambling establishment in New York City, and now part
owner of the Patio Bridge Club, Miami Beach, who is currently
in Las Vegas, has reportedly secured a "solid OK" to start
big-time gambling at the Patio Bridge Club the-next winter
season and,as a result, has been remodeling to take care of same.
