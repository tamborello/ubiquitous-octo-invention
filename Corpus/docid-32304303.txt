NO 92-365

PC stated that the secret nature of these
conferences was impressed upon the PC because at Churchill
Farms MARCELLO and TRAFFICANTE walked out into the middle
of the fields behind the main house and sat for many
hours, Likewise, at TRAFFICANTE’s home in Tampa, MARCELLO
and TRAFFICANTE sat alone in the back yard..

During the past several weeks CARLOS MARCELLO
has stated to the PC that the luncheon at which he was
arrested in New :York City was just that and that he
would not have been in attendance if JOSEPH MARCELLO
had not been so slow in packing at their hotel. If
they had left fifteen minutes earlier than they did
they would not have received the invitation to the
luncheon. MARCELLO stated that the really serious an

Police would have "seen some real power" if they had
found the meeting the day before the arrest.

else." TRAFFICANTE wishes to come in in the rest of eA

the end of MARCELLO'S control of Jefferson and Orleans ;
Parishes, . :

CARLOS MARCELLO told PC that TRAFFICANTE
presented several problems occurring in this part of
the country to “important people" in New York and
elsewhere and created the impression that CARLOS MARCELLO
was to blame for these problems. PC stated that the
