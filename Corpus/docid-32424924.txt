the UN hés now been briefed on the proposal to approach the Cubans

would be for the purpese of establishing in principal
the possibility of such an exchange.

  

2. Mr. McCone reiterated that all reports of Cuban incer~
vention in the Hemisphere are proving to have no substance when chey
are actually run down. In answer to General Taylor's question as to
what the U.S. might do if hard evidence of this kind is obtained,

Mr. Johnson pointed out that a subcommittee of the OAS, on security,
had been authorized at Punta del Este. This committee was given the
authority to mobilize multi-national action against the Castro regime
in the event that such hard information {3s obtained. It was agreed
that whatever information becomes available should be given to General
White, who is the U.S. representative on this subcommittee.

employed by Cuban exile groups in the U.S. and, therefore, they would
be non-attributable to the U.S. Government. He said that available
