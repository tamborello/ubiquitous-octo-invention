Letter to SAC, Miami (2-387) a
Re: JULIO ATON CONSTANZO PALAU; SECRET
GERALD PATRICK HEMMING; et al.

u . .
NOTES on June 9, 1965, furnished data indicating subjects were
forming a commando force in Miami to be used by Dominican General
Antonio Imbert. They were reportedly recruiting Cuban refugees and
American adventurers to make up this force. We also received
information from GIA that Guillermo Belt Ramirez, former Cuban
Ambassador to the United States, and I, Irving Davidson, Washington,
D. C., public relations man and registered agent of various Latin-
American Governments, may be involved. Subjects indicated. contact
with one or both of these individuals who supposedly represented
the United States Government and/or the Organization of American ‘
States (OAS}in recruitment of Cuban exiles to serve in the Dominican
Republ he son of Belt Ramirez is an informant of the Washington/'s}
Field Off nd has furnished information that to his knowledge hi
father is not involved with the recruiting of any Cubans, |but he
had presented a suggestion to the OAS that Cuban technical people
in the United States could be voluntarily formed and placed in ‘the
Dominican Republic as part of the existing Inter-American Peace
For Miami source close to the subject, Hemming, has described
the erfire story as a figment of Hemming’s imagination. » :

Interview with Belt Ramirez should furnish accurate
information concerning this entire matter. It has been determined
that Belt Ramirez and Davidson are not employed in any capacity by
CIA or the State Department.

SEGREL,
