I. learned that in Today's inaugural meeting’ of the World
Peace Council, on which I am reporting in a dispatch of the
same date, Professor LANGE, Polish Deputy Chairman of the
Council ae State, opened fine work by ‘expressing his profound
sorrow over the death of President KENNEDY and affirming that
his passing must be considered a serious loss for humanity.

The French delegate MADAULE expressed similar sentiments, pro-
posing that the entire assembly join. ‘in them. While all the
other delegations were agreeing on this proposal, a Chinese
delegate seized the microphone and, despite the Chairman's
attempts to prevent his speaking, since the intervention of the
Peking delegation had not been.‘requested according to procedure,
stated, shouting, that KENNEDY! s death should not be mourned
since he was the principal éxponent’ of aggressive Capitalism
and that if there should be grief, it should be expresbed for
all those who had died through the crime of aggression of the-
capitalist system, personified éspecially by the Unitdd States.
A profound silence inthe Assembly followed the untimely re-
marks of the Chinese delegate’, after which work was resumed.
