(6) Dan Dwyer and I reviewed Agency originated =
documents in CIA's 201 File on Gilberto Policarpo Lopez. on
It is our understanding you would reconsider CIA's decision to er
deny the Committee's request for a copy of these documents:
(7) With regard to the Committee's letter of January 30,
we agreed:
(a) We-would for the time being narrow the request
_ in paragraph 1 to include only contacts of Director McCone; cole:
(b) We would not alter the requests in paragraphs ee
2 and 3. : —

I trust this summary accords with your understanding of
our discussion, but please let me know if there is any
misunderstanding. :

Sincerely,

James H.” Johnston
