NY T-1 sarisa on fay P2963, oat that MIRTA igre, ,
who is very NEE) in the office o d National Front of
Escambray, (SNFE) (Operation Alpha 66), had int had informed hin that”
the organization would continue its activities against the
present regime in Cuba. NY T-1 stated that Miss TESTE advised
. that there were plans for the organization to carry out
another attack against the Coast of Cuba, but that as of that
time, she knew no details and doubted very much if she would
have any information until after the attack was actually .
carried out.

 

lA-

NY T-1 advised that Miss TESTE has been absent
several times and has been late arriving for work and her
excuse is that she has been putting so much time in the office
of the SNFE (Operation Alpha 66) that she has been getting .
very little sleep. NY T-1 stated that Miss TESTE informed '
him that she does a lot of clerical work for the organization :
at their headquarters, which are located at 103 West 74th i
Street, New York City. iA

 

NY T-1, on May 20, 1963, advised that Miss TESTE \
had informed him on that date that SNFE - Alpha 66 carried.
out a raid inside of Cuba on the night of
May 18, 1963. Miss TESTE told NY T-1 that the organization
raided an Army post, which is located at Tarara, which is a
well-known beach front area outside Havana, Cuba. Miss TESTE
related to NY T-1 that the office in New York had no details !
on the attack and presumably a statement regarding the attack :
would be made by the organization probably in a release '
from Caracas, Venezuela. '
