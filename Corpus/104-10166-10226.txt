Against reports trat her husband w76 a G-2 agent. It was
’ subsequently reported in the press that CLELLAR had been

executed in PRELMEN on 23 September 1961. Hector FEFLES stated

that CUELLAR lest his nerve after his arrest oy G-2 and was forced

ment of CUELLAK'S executrof was false; that he is still alive. |

  

(218) His present location and status is unknown,

After the disruptive arrests of March and April 1961, UR

activity as a resistance movement was curtailed, but an effort

was made to maintain organizational contace and communication

channels, Much of the interim leadership and direction cane from
. former UR officials in asylum via couriers and dead drops. (26; 184)
- Little could be accomplished for months after the invasion, since
7 many UR members were among thousands arrested throughout the

country. Assessment of UR losses of personnel and equipment

continued, however, and new coordinaters were eventually appointed

to positions left vacant by those arrested or in asylum, (103)

The skeletal lerdership mechznism remaining in PBRUMEN needed

direction from the asylees and it also looked to them fov 4
: obtaining external support after their exfil via safeconduct to :
: PBPRINE, Thus direction of UR was shifting from the strong :

movement inside to the leaders in embassies and, finally, to a
PBPRIME once its leaders left PBRUMEN. (63) Communications were
maintained continuously between these two (internal and external)
UR elements. (26; 149; 170) :

. Owing to his PBPRIME citizenship, first of the UR leaders to
arrive in PBPRIME was Fernando CAVADA in mid-1961. He proceeded
to ZRMETAL, contacted "Bill Billings" and later "Jim Bowdin." Im
September 1962 he was joined there by BRITO, SANCHEZ, ZAYAS, and °

: ethers for discussions and planning on the future of’ the UR’ and F
{ the support to be expected from KUBARK. "Cal Hitch" and"Jim , H
{ Bowdin" represented KUBARK at talks which took place at ZRMETAL ;

4 from, 22-29 September 1961. ZAYAS and SANCHEZ stated the UR had

been reorganized in PBRUMEN and that after receiving certain

training from KUBARK they intended to return, (204) KUBARK

was .committed to support the UR "as needed" in PBRUMEN, but

nothing. was to be done to support UR in exile. The UR leaders

were.advised to join AMBUD to receive support for the organizatio:
in PDPRIME, but this was not made a provision te thelr receiving
eupport for the PBRUMEN element, (31) They were further enjoined
to desist from any show of antagonism toward AMBUD-1 (204) ©

ta. “BRITO and others were seat to training the latter part of ;
a 1981. CAVADA was sent to the JMWAVE area in October to report to
: “hz, Petes" as the contact between KUBARK and UR, and for “epecial
iq assignments" in connection with unigication of -counterrevolutionary
5 Organizations in PBPRIME. (31) He was not utilized by "Mr, Peters"
for weeks after his arrival in the JMWAVE area. According to CAVADA,
both ZAYAS and SANCHEZ were working with Alberto FERNANDEZ and "were.
i more intorosted in politics than in returning to PBRUMEN, re= :
i geiving training, and giving assistance to the membora of the UR
ra in PBRUMEN," (31h CAVADA waa tuformed he would not act as liaison .~
it betwoon the UR and KUBARK. because he lacked "military knowledge."

“special assignmonte”" were given him. BRITO completed training

ousted as General Coordinator of the UR at a meeting in the JMWAVE
area in March 1962. (8) coe

Tie UR in PBRUMEN sutcered further losses in August 1962
(see Part II) but continues to function as a resistance movement,
with exploitable potential. There are questions regarding its
penetration by G-2 (DSE) agents. Individual leaders of UR now
in PBPRIME claim personal networks of trustworthy followers in
PBRUMEN ready to act if provided the necessary weapons and
support.

Although there is no disunity evident in the UR in PBRUMEN,
the movement in PBPRIME today is experiencing what seems ine
evitably to occur among external groups: bitter factionalism,
There are two main factions in existence as of January 1963:

yD RODRIGUEZ Espada with GARCIA Oller, who received

1. documented authority to represent the PBRUMEN group
. in exile; and :

8) the TORRIENTE group, a political conglomeration of
nat pocket organizations having little contact with any
. \ Movement in PBRUMEN. .

RODRIGUEZ Espada is supported by KUFARK, This UR faction is
attempting to enter AMBUD; it publishes a newspaper: it is
intended to provide an overt umbrella mechanism to cover KUBARK
exploitation of KUCAGE, KUTUBE and PM assets, operationally
compartmented and handled unilaterally, (See Attachmeat B for
details.) a

PART I,,
Activity in PBPRIME

The UR in PBPRIME was registered with the Attorney General under
the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 by Hector FEBLES, :
Luis VEGA and Aurelio FERNANDEZ on 22 November 1961. It was
described as “Coordinator of several underground organizations
fighting Communism;" and it listed aa “foreign principals" 27
organizations claimed to exist in PBRUMEN, The number of memberg
of UR.in PBPRIME was given as "four delegates" and the number
outside PBPRIME was:‘noted only as 32 (sic) underground
organizations. (177)

    

Noted in Part I of thie Attachment,-these ‘signatortes:-were |
three of the "delegates abroad" established in the JHWAVE area
garly in 196] by KUSARK to cover for and-‘support the UR in
PRRUKEN, ‘Tho fourth, Alberto FERNANDEZ, waa involved in para~
militery and maritime ops and did not actively participate in
overs political activity. Meetinga attonded by members of the aj.
Sxilé somiunity had been hold by tho ovort UR delegates prior to 7
dune 1961, when it was reported that. anti-Communist loctures were
given at fa N.W. 17th Avenue by Oreatos MARTINEZ (aka: ALCANTARA)

~The UR leadership in PBRUMEN received its most damaging blow
during.the period following the landings at Playa Giron when whole-
gale arrests were ordered throughout the island, Of the 13
coordinators named, eight obtained asylum and are now in PBPRIME,
Rafael DIAZ Hanscomb and Humberto SORI Marin (arrested in March)
were executed on 20 April. ARUFE and his wife were killed 21 .
April in a gun battle with G-2 members who had come to arrest
them,.. BARROSO, arrested at the time, was executed later in the
year... BETANCOURT and BORRON are serving 30 and 20-year sentences
on the Isle of Pines. (184; 13)” Many other members of UR were
also arrested and sentenced to prison terms, Among them: Robert
GEDDES, Cosme de la TORRIENTE, Dr, Raul VILLASUSO, Capt. Felix
CASTRO Guevara, Maj. Gonzalo MIRANDA, and J, M, MENDIOLA. (31)
Jose RODRIGUEZ (PEPE) continued to function with UR, later as
Intelligence Coordinator, and was ultimately arrested in another
roundup of UR leaders on the morning of 30 August 1962.

According to several reports from sources directly involved,
the primary reason for so many G-2 arrests of UR personnel in
April 1961 was its denunciation ty a G-2 collaborator or penetration
Sgent named Fedro Sergio CUELLAR Alon. (aka: Sergio.Alonso).,.
member of a KUBARK infil toam. CUELLAR was sent tn to serva as

a confusing history of CUELLAR's activity, unexplained absencss,
etc., most of which is recorded in his 201 filo. CUELLAR nevor —

SOTOLONGO claims to have porsonally witnossed CUELLAR's denunciation

Materiel from PBPRIME with which the UR resistance was to
operate first arrived at selected reception peints in late
February 1961, Wore clandestine shipments arrived in March and
early April. Marcial ARUFE, National Coordinator for Transport :
and Supply, was responsible for reception, distribution and .
cacheing, with frequent cvoperation and advice from GARCIA Oller,
who was able to provide trucks and warehouse facilities as required
until transfer to safer storage on fincas in the vicinity of the
capital, From these caches the equipaent was to be passed to

1 «~resistance elements in the Provinces, (31; 184)
- By mid-March of 1961 the potential of the UR as an effective
EC

opposition movement in PBRUMEN had grown considerably. Contact
was maintained with member organizations at meetings of their
Coordinators from time to time in Habana. (9) Attempts were made
to organize resistance units in rural areas for an eventual
revolt, (2) It was reported that Robert GEDDES had penetrations
‘in(2Z police stations in Habana with the object of gaining control
over them if revolt. or invasion materialized, GEDDES also was
reported to be working on a plan for the capture of northern Las
Villas Province by utilicing contacts among Rebel Army and police
forces with access to arms to seize the G-2.and PSP offices in -
every city and town in northern Las Villas prior to an invasion.
He yas alleged to have given his word to numerous centacts that

 

no invasion would occur until the UR had completed its preparatory :
work, . (Preparations were incomplete and the UR was surprised by.

the timing of the invasion of 17 April). (153) The UR action : .
program included coordination of uprisings in Pinar del Rio, — u 5
Matanzas and Oriente Provinces; sabotage operations throughout 3
the island; organization of.a rebellion in the PBRUMEN navy; :
and the execution of Operation VACA, which was handled by Wiifredo
H. BRITO and Fernando F. CAVADA. (31) Operational activity and 4°
organized strength were mounting steadily, '

 

Te was at this time of UR ascendency that an unfortunate
security breach occurred at a meeting in the Biltmore section of
Habana on 18 March 1961. Leading members of UR and MRR (and
of other groups) met to discuss unification of resistance
activity. This was apparently a continuation of discussions
held earlier between UR and MRR concerning an operational merger,
What should have bean a clandestine cenference between a fer
UR erd MRR leaders wes expanded until it included over:36>=
leading resistance figures. PBRUMEN security forces learned | «
of the meeting and ita location, ordered a surprise raid and
errested approximately 38 participants. (203) Included among
those arrested: National Coordinators Rafael DIAZ Hanscomb and
Rogelio GONZALEZ Corzo of UR and NRR; Maj. Humberto SORI Marin,
Wilitary Coordinator of UR; and many others whose arrests

While DIAZ Hanscomb was in PBPRIME, the UR organizing committee
appointed his provisionally as the first General Coordinator of the
UR, with Andres ZAYAS as Civil Coordinator and Maj, Humberto sort
Marin as National Military Coordinator, (31) Discussions were held
with the decimated MRR leadership in an attempt to achieve a
complete merger with the UR, A clandestine newspaper was started
(Cruzada, which changed to Unidad Revolucionaria in February 1961)
with a circulation of 20,000 copies every two weeks. Initiated
oy GARCIA Oller, the purpose of the newspaper was to circulate
anti-Communist propaganda. Financial support for the newly
organized UR came from contributions by its leaders, sales of bonds,
and the $20,000 “take” from the holdup of the Tropical Brewery,
planned and exccuted.by GARCIA Oller in December 1960, Rafael DIAZ
returned to Habana on 13 February 1961 and reported that he had
received formal assurances of support from ODYOKE. (184) He began
working on a program of action for the UR and the selection of :
leaders to form the official National Executive. For reasons of
security and operational effectiveness he rejected the concept of
immediate appointment of an executive comprising all National
Coordinators of UR member organizations. (31) . The basic outline

@rief Historical and Political Background

‘The clandestine resistance movem-at, Unidad Revolucionari&
(UR), vas founde]ed in PSKUMEN ta December 19Gy by the Yeaders of 27
counterrevolutionary organizations (ur factivas thereof) to
achieve & cooraination of renintance activity ta one strong
untty, gaia recogaition by FRD (now CRC), and odtain from ODYOKE
the secpons and support required to overthrow the goveranent,
(23531)

The organizing leadership consisted mainly of former menbers
: of the MRR, impatient over inactivity and disillustoned by the
’ inability of ite National Coordinator to obtain effective support

‘ from ODYOKE after several trips to PBPRIME during 1960, Behind
. the planning for the UR based on the unification theory was Rafael
‘ DIAZ Hanscowb (aka: RAFAEL), MRR National Coordinator for —

fptelligence, Though advised by Antonio de VARONA in late 1960
: that for political reasons the "Frente" (FRD) was not in favor of
‘ ereatirg @ unified resistance organization, the founders of UR -
' proceeded with its formation, convinced of eventual recognitioa,
4 (3) 16 was fully intended that if such recognition did not

ef the “Frente” but, as they might logically have felt, with a
