ADMINISTRATIVE:

On July 15, 1969, NO 1075-C advised he has borrowed
many times from the Rex Finance Company, and only recently
failed to make a payment on schedule, and someone at the com-
pany was giving him a bad crédit reputation. Source therefore
went to JOE BOHRER and severly reprimanded him, possibly included
a threat, and left, Later MORRIS LANSBURG called source in
and asked him to go easy with BOHRER, indicating that he was
closely related and said "If you hurt him, you hurt me." Source
advised that this LANSBURG is the same MORRIS LANSBURG that
previously“brought sack full of money (Bills) to CARACCI at
the amusement company office. The above was furnished.to SA
L. M. SHEARER, JR.

On August 12, 1969, source advised that EMANUEL
LANSBURG, 544 Andrew Street, New Orleans, is LANSBURG who
brought large amount of bills in a bag to CARACCI as reported
in the past. This LANSBURG was present when CARACCI called
the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas to get his gambling losses
back. He told CARACCI not to worry about the losses when the
losses were being discussed befdGre the telephone call. NO
1075-C has not observed MORRIS LANSBURG, former owner of the
Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas in connection with CARACCI.
