‘MC CARTHY, JR. is. the Assistant Vice President of the —
Public Bank, Detroit, who was involved in financial
negotiations of JAMES HOFFA of the Teamsters Union.

case feel that he was evasive and would not be the type

. of individual to contact in a discreet investigation.

Since MC CARTHY is Assistant Vice President of the Public
Bank, a-relatively new bank in Detroit, it was not. deemed
advisable to interview him or any other official regarding

SA HQWARD K, RUTHERFORD he had received information from
TNDTOYAINENEZ, a _member of the Movimiento Patriotico de
that a committee of three Cubans is due to come to
Tampa in the near future to purchase two airplanes from
DOMINIC BARTONE, a salesman from Cleveland, Ohio. _It was
stated the Cubans are coming to Tampa from Cuba and are.
supporters of the government of FIDEL CASTRO. They are
supposed to deposit the money for the airplanes with RAY -
CAMPDERROS, an officer of the Marine Bank & Trust Company,
Tampa.

The foregoing ‘information was furnished verbally.
to Customs Agent SAM JOHNSON, Tampa, December 23; 1959.
