i WEEE :
7. Communications Security Survey - The BOB study group has finished with ~
- #¢he Ranch and has completed about 2/3 of the Washington portion of its work.
The balance should go fairly quickly in view of the fact that we recently blasted

loose the information which the group needed on the telephone system at the

’ White House and EOB, The group will probably not examine the emergency

locations. There is not much there that they can usefully do and it does not
“seem worth the time and effort to override Ted Cliftonts objections; besides,
this less urgent task can be done at some future date,

 

“The group is running behind schedule {report due on March 1), They asked for

another month, and I gave it to them; I'm fairly confident they will meet the
new deadline,

OC.
