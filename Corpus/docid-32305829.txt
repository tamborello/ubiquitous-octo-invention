does not expect to do so; however, he agreed to consider contacting
CERRITO in an attempt to elicit an opinion from him.

On 4/2/68 SF-2689-C-TE advised he visited with SALVATORE TARANTO
on Sunday, 3/31/68.

TARANTO advised that he saw MANNY FPIGLIA a few days ago. FIGLIA

recent "Life" magazine article and that the photograph of him

in company with FRANK GARAFOLO took him completely by surprise.
According to FIGLIA, CERRITO is now more determined than ever to :
follow through on his libel suit against "Life", fo

 

 

FIGLIA also told TARANTO that SALVATORE MARINO “got the message" {
in the "Life" article that a cheese man referred to therein was
he. : .

FIGLIA also advised TARANTO that DOMINICK ANZALONE was also upset
by the "Life" article and is in favor of CERRITO's determination
to get the matter into court and has offered CERRITO any financial
help he may need.

It is to be noted that SALVATORE MARINO is the owner and operator
of the California Cheese Co. at San Jose, Calif.

On 4/9/68 SF-2689-C-TE advised that he was in personal contact
with BILL SCIORTINO on 4/4/68 in San Francisco. SCIORTINO ad-
vised informant that he personally contacted JOE CERRITO at his
home in San Jose on the specific ‘instructions of JIMMY LANZA.
fecerding to SCIORTINO, JIMMY LANZA was emotionally disturbed
concerninp the "Life" magazine article, especially in view of the
fact that it plainly identified him as leader of the San Francisco
family of the LCN. . SCIORTINO said that the purpose of his contact
with CERRITO at San Jose was to advise CERRITO that LANZA approves
of and will support CERRITO's decision to carry on his libel suit
against "Life".

“The San Diego Office, by communicaticn dated 4/10/68, advised that
SD-1064-C-TE furnished the following information concerning his

Informant stated that SANTO showed displeasure with the fact that B
the informant is now only a"soldier" after having been a success- ce
ful "Capo" before: going to prison. SANTO did not seem to be a
sympathetic toward California LCN leadership, especially the way

it was portrayed in the recent "Life" magazine article which
ridiculed the San Jose. Femily. He suggested that the informant
attempt to regain his "Capo" status. SANTO indicated he was more
closely connected with the Chicago leadership than with the Detroit
leaders and that he generally liked the idea of one LCN Family

for all of California with closer ties to Chicago.

 

SANTO questioned the informant about the "Life" magazine article
regarding the San Jose Family. The informant told him it was all
true. He told SANTO that at the time he was a close friend of LCN
"Capo" ANGELO MARINO of San Jose. He described how ANGELO's aa
father, SALVATORE MARINO, had been a "Capo" in the San Jose Family
and that several years ago, the San Jose LCN boss, JOE CERRITO,
_wanted SAL to step down. SAL contacted the informant to get his
opinion and the informant advised him that since CERRITO felt that
way, he should step down, but only on condition that his son,
ANGELO, take his place. CERRITO agreed to this and this is how
ANGELO became "Capo",

 

i

SANTO deseribed ANGELO as a very weak man who could not kill any-
one if his own life deperded on it and that he had no talent what-
ever for LCN racket activity; that most of his adult life was
spent chasing women and gambling while his father had to run the
California Cheese Co. .

The informant told SANTO that around 1963 or 1964 ANGELO came to
contact the informant and told him that he had received an
execution contract and sought advice. The informant advised

that ANGELO wanted him to help him but he told ANGELO he was still
on parole and could have nothing to do with it. He told ANGELO

to take a couple of trusted'soldiers"” and carry out the contract.
Sometime later he heard that the intended victim was picked up .
by INS for deportation and he always suspected ANGELO, instead of
killing the intended victim, made an anonymous call to have him
picked up rather than kill him. He stated that from questioning
ANGELO at that time, he learned ANGELO had even talked to the
intended victim while the contract. was in force and he also learned
the contract had been given ANGELO by the LCN San Jose boss, JOE
CERRITO. 7
