that CASAY was subsequently shot by the underground and
ORDONEZ was killed in an automobile accident. All four
of the individuals had formerly worked in the sabotage
group headed by CUBRIA and were to work with CUBRIA in
order to implement the assassination plot against CASTRO.

not a part of the plot. The ‘plan to kill CASTRO involved
placing a bomb in CASTRO’s automobile. ROIG stated that
he suggested: that this plan be deferred until such time _
as more Cubans turned against CASTRO, for he felt that
time would help; however, plans. were made to implement

the attack on CASTRO's life. CUBRIA arrived in Cuba
around, the early part of July,-1961, and a few days later,
while conferring with the four previously mentioned indi-
viduals who were to assist him in his attack on CASTRO, ane
CUBRIA was arrested. ROIG stated that the four individuals oo ane
with whom CUBRIA was plotting were the ones who actually ;
arrested him and turned CUBRIA over to the Cuban G-2. No
action was taken against the other four and ROIG. stated
he feels that they were cooperating with the Cuban Govern-

ment at all times and had no intention of assassinating ah
CASTRO ° :
