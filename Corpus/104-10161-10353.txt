1. On 11 October 1961 Mr. Jeremiah Mullane, WH 4 Security, con-.
tacted me regarding the proposed use of the Subject in Building #25
under the non-official, JMWAVE cover. According to Mullana, the Subject
was to be used as a spotter and recruiter. He is a Type A contract
employee « “ .

2. After review of Subject's covert file and discussing the matter
with the IRD operator who recently polygraphed the Subject, I advised
Mullane that it would appear to be undesirable at this time to use

the Subject in capacity indicated.,n view of the fact that while
the Subject was || in approximately 1960, it was
ascertained that] ey “ :

I agreed and edvised him, however, that in the ebsence
of information to the contrary, it would appear that the Subject's
assignment and use under JMWAVE cover would be an unwarranted risk.

I suggested that the Subject might be able to conduct his duties
outside of the Building and that such an arrangement would be more
secure, ie. in the event that he recruited an individual who turned
sour, he would not be linked with JMWAVE. I referred Mullane to —
IRD for further discussions with the polygraph operator concerned.

I plan to take n6.further action on this matter in the absence of an
official request for his conversjon and/or assignment to JMWAVE.
