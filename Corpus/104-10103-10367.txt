) AMLEO-3 said "it is possible," and CASTRO then asked "but

he calls you every day." This information, according ta,
AMLEO-3, was included in a letter from his wife which he
received on 14 September 1963. There is no copy of the
letter either in tle AMTRUNK Operational file or in AMLEO-3's
dossier to confirm that statement. /Comment: AMLEO-3
defected to the U.S. in December 1963, immediately became

a JMWAVE Station asset, and was used to screen names for
the AMTRUNK Operation. He was terminated in July 1964,
reportedly due to conflict with JMWAVE Station for not
having exfiltrated his wife and children. He returned to
Cuba'on his own in 1965, allegedly to exfiltrate his wife
and children, was arrested, sentenced to 30 years
imprisonment, served two years, and was set free in July

or August 1967, There are two firm accusations that he

was a CASTRO agent as early as July 1963. ‘Comment: if
true, it appears that AMLEO-3 could have been providing
CASTRO information on the AMTRUNK operation from its’
inception. Also, it perhaps could account for CASTRO's
statement that AMLEO-3 called his wife in Cuba every day.7 |

A newspaper article on changing trends among
high-level personnel within the CASTRO Government, written
by Tad SZULC, appeared in a major daily newspaper. SZULC
repdrtedly told a high-level U.S. Government official
that Dr. MORENO, the AMTRUNK team leader, was the source
of his information, 4A debriefing of MORENO produced :
information at considerable variance to that in SZULC's
article. Confronted with the article, MORENO admitted
talking to SZULC but denied that most of the information
in the article was based on anything which MORENO had said.
The article created considerable furor in Washington, D.C.

Comment: specifics concerning the content of the article

and name of the paper in which it appeared were not cited

in the dispatch. There is no copy of the article either

in the AMTRUNK operational file or in SZULC's dossier, If
true, SZULC's article(s) could have been used as a channel
for providing information to the Cuban Government, wittingly
or unwittingly.7

SUBJECT: AMTRUNK Operation

 

1. Description:

The proposal for this operation was presented to
CIA by Tad SZULC, via Mr. Hurwitch, the State Department
Cuban Coordinator, in February 1963, It allegedly originated
. with Jorge VOLSKY and Dr. Nestor MORENO who referred to it
as the "Leonardo Plan." Its objective was to overthrow the
Cuban Government by means of a conspiracy among high-level .
military and civilian leaders of the government culminating
in a coup d'etat which would oust both CASTRO and. the
Communists from power. The CIA supported this activity and
encrypted it AMTRUNK, The AMTRUNK cryptonym was changed to
AMSTEAMER in the Spring of 1965, several additional :
infiltration/exfiltration missions were attempted or
completed, and the project was terminated in late 1966 due
to security problems. In retrospect, the activity appears
oe ee to have been insecure and doomed to failure from its inception
Pe primarily for lack of compartmentatim , and loose talk on
the part of its principals.

on 7 September 1963 at Santa Maria Beach, Cuba, in which
she asked CASTRO's permission for her and her children to
leave Cuba to join AMLEO-3 in the U.S. Mrs. AMLEO-3
reportedly expressed fear that AMLEO-3 would find another
woman if she didn't join him. CASTRO replied by asking :
"do you consider yourself a burden to your husband?" Mrs.

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in top positions of the army were dissatisfied to the point
that they may have been thinking of plotting against Fidel.
'/€omment: There is no proof that the message came to the
‘attention of Fidel CASTRO. However, if the operation was
penetrated, as it appears to have been, this information®
could have reached him,7

The following information was naa
Secret Writing message from AMTRUNK-9 dated
6 November, postmarked 22 November, and received on

December 1963. AMIRUNK-9 allegedly received the information
from two other sources. AMTRUNK-9 reported that during the
early part of November 1963 Fidel CASTRO Ruz, during the
course of a private conversation, expressed fear of the
possibility of "Commando Insurrections" which might take

place on a large scale in Cuba, as the Cuban economy was such
that he could not maintain a state of military alert ‘for a
long time. He indicated that any prolonged period of military
alert might cause discontent among the troops, a situation
which would be dangerous and create irreparable consequences,
So as to negate this possibility, CASTRO was undertaking an
intensive propaganda campaign to give confidence to his troops
and to limit the occurrence of any internal uprising.
/AMTRUNK-9 made an unauthorized trip to Cuba following his
termination by JMWAVE Station. The files do not reflect

his subsequent whereabouts.7

e. WAVE Cable 0952 (IN 03920) dated 23 January 1964;
Aad e :

In a debriefing of AMTRUNK~-9 { ]
on 17 January 1964, he provided rather sen nts
that the Government of Cuba was ready to fall at any moment,
that enormous quantities of weapons were in Cuba, and that
the Soviets were out to get Fidel. However, AMTRUNK-9 was
unable to substantiate such stories with sources, dates and
facts. It was learned that Dr. MORENO planned to introduce
AMTRUNK-9 to VOLSKY. It was pointed out that SZULC, ;
personally or through VOLSKY, may obtain information for a
sensational-type article such as he wrote last September /19637
following the MORENO interview. ~
