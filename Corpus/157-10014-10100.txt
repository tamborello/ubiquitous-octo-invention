A "special" NSC meeting was held on this day:
The only record of this meeting in the NSC
minutes states: "On instructions from the
Executive Secretary no memorandum was written."
(NSC Minutes)

Special Group approves evaluation of agents
for Cuban sugar mill sabotage. GRAY "discussed

‘this matter with his associate" (Eisenhower)

and reported two tactical objections.
(SG Minutes)

GRAY tells Special Group that any covert-action
like sugar mill sabotage should be undertaken
only, after overall consideration of "whether
and how the U.S. wishes to move against CASTRO."
(SG Minutes)

At an NSC meeting, Allen DULLES "reported that’
a plan to affect the situation in Cuba was being
worked on. Admiral BURKE suggested that any

plan for the removdl of Cuban leaders should be
a package deal, since many of the leaders around

CASTRO were even worse than CASTRO." (NSC Minutes)

At a Special Group meeting, after a paper
titled "General Covert Action Plan for Cuba”
was read, there was "a general discussion as
to what would be the effect on the Cuban

scene if FIDEL and RAUL CASTRO. and CHE GUEVARA
should disappear simultaneously." (SG Minutes)

"GRAY asked the [Special] Group's views on what
happens after TRUJILLO, specifically how CASTRO

-can be kept out of the Dominican Republic."

Acting DCI CABELL recommends U.S. military, inter-
vention after TRUJILLO departs. (SG Minutes)

Issues and Questions

Why were no minutes written?

Does context show that phrase "his —
associate" refers to President
EISENHOWER?

Did such consideration involve
assassination plotting?

Was this "package deal" the simultaneous
triple assassination plot that was
mentioned on November 3, 1960?

Does this simultaneous disappearance
plan refer to assassination planning?

Is there a connection between this
Special Group discussion and the NSC
discussion on March 14, 1960, re a plan
to remove Cuban leaders?

. Did U.S. support TRUJILLO'S opponents out

of a desire to keep CASTRO out of the
Dominican Republic? ~ :

At an NSC meeting presided over by Vice President
NIXON, Allen DULLES reported "TRUJILLO'S position
continued to weaken and was now quite precarious.

(he] thought further attempts will be made to kill

or oust TRUJILLO." Under Secretary of State
DILLON said "if TRUJILLO could be removed from

power in the Dominican Republic while pro-CASTRO

elements were prevented from seizing power
in that country, our anti-CASTRO campaign
throughout Latin America would receive a
great boost. The Vice President agreed that
getting rid of TRUJILLO would be a favorable
development for us." (NSC Minutes)

Allen DULLES predicted at an NSC meeting, that

one possible outcome with respect to CASTRO
was an assassination that would make CASTRO
a martyr. (NSC Minutes)

GRAY says "the U.S. has taken publicly about
all that it can afford to take from the
CASTRO government." | (SG Minutes)

Memo from the Chief of CIA's Western Hemis-

phere Division to the Acting DCI recommending
delivery of high-powered rifles with telescopic
scopes to the opponents of TRUJILLO. The

memo said: “approval for delivery of these
arms has been given by ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF
STATE ROY RUBOTTOM."” :

President EISENHOWER met with Secretary of
State HERTER and others to discuss the ;
Dominican Republic. "The President thought
we should knock out of any documents on file

any reference to starting a revolution."
(Conference Memorandum)

abies”

go

Issues and Questions

Were these U.S. attempts to kill TRUJILLO?

DILLON'S comment indicates that the U.S.
had an active interest in removing TRUJILL(

What did NIXON mean by "getting TRUJILLO"? .

Does this show that assassination was not
a favored alternative because it would
produce martyrdom?

General atmosphere of vehement opposition
to CASTRO.

Was the Special Group aware of this action
Was the President aware of the plan?
Purpose of weapons?
