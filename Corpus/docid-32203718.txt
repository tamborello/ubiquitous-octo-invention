(2) Warren Commission Phase. Rocca places the beginning

 

of the Warren Commission vhase around January 23, 1964, when J.

Lee Rankin contacted Helms and asked for CIA assistance for the

Commission. Helms delegated Rocca to be the “voint of contact"

of the CIA with the Warren Commission. Rocca's own Counterintelli-

gence staff involved in research matters for the Commission

included Tom Dooley, Paul Hartman and Thomas Hall. corner CIA

personnel involved with the Commission vere QORREUTIEo) Murohy

(Chief of SB), J.C. King, Wigren (Chief SB Research), and Bagley

(Deputy Chief SB). Rocca noted that as liaison became more

informal, raft members of the Commission had direct contact
( , vith @QEES Murvhy, Wirgren and Bagley. Helms maintained

direct contact with Rankin.

Rocca emphasized that the Warren Commission phase was not

interoreted by CIA as an investigation. Rocca said that when

the Warren Commission "task force'' was established, all 2h B
cables and materials generated in the GPFLOOR period from Qe)
desk were made available to the task force. Rocca added, however,
that the task force made no appraisal of the GPFLOOR phase. When
questioned if the Warren Commission "task force'' reviewed Mexico
City traffic to check name traces, for example, Rocca replied

the material was left alone excevt for the allegations seer as

the Alvarado matter which concerned the Commission. GMRSESM

Cuba. Rocca also suggested that J.C. King might have known of
some sensitive operations in general but that he would have

. 2
been left out on svecifics. Rocca added that thiccon ieee

have known about sensitive overations through osmosis" because
26

(mse as desk Chief, Western Hemisphere, would send out
traffic to stations including traffic dealing with operations.
Rocca noted that the DDP or Director could have by-passed
Care by authoring and cabling a message themselves.

With regard to Western Hemisphere cable traffic and assass-
ination plots, Rocca.. noted that in April 1975 there was an
individual (name unknown) from Western Hemisphere appointed
by Dave Phillips to work with the Inspector General. This
individual found the memo that discussed Desmond Fitzgerald's

having used Robert Kennedy's name in meeting with AMLASH, in

the WH files.

(5) Miscellaneous. Rocca saw nothing strange in the
FBI report on Oswald's FPCC activities being routed to SAS.
He stated that SAS would have received all reports of relevance
to Cuba.

Rocea could offer no explanation as to why the WAVE cable
discussing anti-Castro groups’ public statement on the
assassination was filed in the "sensitive Ops-Kennedy file"

and later placed in the Oswald 201 file.
