like to determine who this is prior to his departure for
Florida on a short vacation, date unknown. The informant
said that LA ROCCA is extremely thankful that Pittsburgh
newspapers did not receive any publicity concerning the
failure of his adopted son to register and the subsequent
interview. He indicated that the entire affair could have
been "messy". According to the informant, LA ROCCA said
that in an effort to determine whether his telephone at
his Ingomar, Pa., residence is tapped, he would intentionally
place a call telling an unknown individual that he would
be going to New York and would Sive that individual a
non-existent New York address. He would thereafter wait
to determine the action taken by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. ‘
