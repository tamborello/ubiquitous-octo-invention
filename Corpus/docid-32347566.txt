MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : HSCA Access to.Mexico City History

1. HSCA requested access to some 200 pages of the
three-volume history. of.Mexico City - about a third of
the material.. Thé substantive content runs the gamut from
the history of Mexico University through detailed operation-
al support capabilities and high level political connect-
ions and activities. It is an impressive accumulation of
operational activity - classical sources and methods, as
well as detailed revelations about past events.

2. We pointed out that the agreement between Chairman
Stokes and DDCI Carlucci directly faced the issue of the :
irrelevancy of the vast majority of the history, and the
sensitivity of it. The. HSCA position had been that it had
to verify this, and.the access given to senior levels was
to satisfy this. Now it was being requested in connection
with depositions, which would serve to get this material
into a Committee transcript. Since some two-thirds of the
station's history (the work covers 1947 through 1969) pre-
ceded the visit of Oswald to Mexico in 1963 and assassination
of the President, that clearly had nothing to do with the
Committee's charter. I added that Mr. Carlucci is out of
town, and will not be back until some time Sunday, so I
could not go back to him. The request was so far beyond the
agfeemént, that.I felt I could not modify it. Cornwell then
asked that I speak to the Director. ~ ; . :

a .
SS. ¥ daw tHe Director at about noon, and summarized
the agreement and the dilemma, also going over the above.
He stated that I could offer access to one senior staff
member (in addition to Blakey and Cornwelljon the condition
that material from the history not be used in depositions.

4. I spoke with Cornwell, giving him the message. He
said that they may wish to use some of the material. I
replied that the history is based on other sources; those
related to the portion that is within the Committee's charter
