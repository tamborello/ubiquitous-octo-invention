WASHINGON, Nov. 39—On Oct. 19,
1963, the then-Attorney General of the
United States put his personal signa-
ture on a document that launched and
legitimatized one of the most horren-

’ dous abuses of Federal Police power in
this century.

In Senator Frank Church’s subcom-
mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and  subse-
quent unauthorized bugging and at-
tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther
‘King Jr. is being gingeriy examined,
with the “investigation” conducted in
such a way as not to unduly em-
barrass officials of the Kennedy or
Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has
fecused on the PB. ‘Yesterday, when<
the committee counsel fiest set forth
the result of shuffling through press °
clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-+
parlment had existed in 1962; today,”
an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it
was Robért: Kennedy who authorized
the wiretap of Dr, King, and that “the
President of the United States and the
Atlorney Generel specifically discussed

- their concern of Communist influence
with Dr. King.”

But the Church committee showed
no zest for getting further to the Ken-
nody root of thie precedent to Water-
gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church
were willing to let the chips fall where

- they may, he would call some know!-
edgeable witnesses into the glare of
the camera lights and ask them some
questions that have gone unasked for
thirteen years.

For example, he couid call Nicholas
Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-
nedy’s deputy and successor, and ask
what he knows of the Kennedy de-
cision to wivetep Dr. King. Who at
Justice concurred in the recommenda-
tion? How does the F.B.L know the ;
President was consulted or informed? -

Aftac Mr, Katzenbach assumed of-
fice, and the wiret«pping continued,
he was told by enery newsmen that
the F.B.1. was leaking scurrilous in-
formation sbout 2r. King. Why did he
wait for four months, and for a thou-
sand telepiionic interceptions, to dis~
continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sert of testimony
vould erode Senator Cnurch’s political
base. That is why we do not see for-
mer Assistant FBT. director Cartha
(Deke) Deloach, Lyaton Johnson's
personal contact with the FBI ip the
witness chair. What did President
Jolinsen know about the character-
ssination n did he
ew it? What conversations tuok
place between Mr. Beloach and Presi-
dent Johnso: on the tapping of Dr.

«Cover-Up
‘e —— =
The committee is not asking embar-
rassing questions even. when answers
are readily available. A couple of
weeks ago, at an open hearing, an
F.B.i, man inadveriently started to
blurt out an episode about newsmen
who were weritapping in 1862 witl
the apparent knowledge of Attorney’
General Kennedy. The too-willing wit.
ness was promptly shooshed into si-
Jence, and told that such information!
would be developed only in executive
session. Nobody raised an eyebrow.
That pattern of containment by the
Church committee is vividly shown by
the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican and Democratic con-

ventions which were ordered by Lyn-
don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-
cal headquarters were worse than the
crime committed at Watergate, since
they involved the use of the F.B.L,
but the Church investigators seem to
be determined not to probe too deeply.

if F.B.1. documents say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why are those men not given the
same opportunity to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent’s men? If Lyndon Johnson com-
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the F.B.I. to spy on political
opponents, who can be brought for-
ward to teil us all about it?

But that would cause embarrass. |

ment to Democrats, and Senator
Church wants to embarrass profes-
sional employees of investigatory
agencies only. A new sense of Con-
gressional decorum exists, far from
the sense of outrage expressed in the
Senate Watergate committee’s hear-
ing room. When it is revealed that the
management of NBC News gave press
credentials to L.B.J.’s spies at the 1964
convention, everybody blushes dernure-;
ly—and nobody demands to know!
which network executive made what,
decision under what pressure. i.
I have been haranguing putient®
readers for years about the double
standard applied to Democratic and
Republican political crimes, and had
hoped the day would come when the
hardoali precedenis set by the Ken-
nedy and Johnson men would he laid
before the public in damning detail.
Obviously, Democrat Frank Courch
is not the man to do it. His jowl-
shaking indignation is all too swlec-
tive; the trail of high-level esbonsi-
bility for the crimes cont 3
