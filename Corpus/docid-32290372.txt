on several occasions during December and January and
advised that she is quite certain that GIANCANA did not

CG 7016-PC and CG 6687-PC, both of whom were
closely associated with GIANCANA, in the ‘leadership of

Both advised that they felt that they would be knowledgeble

being current leaders of organized crime her should
