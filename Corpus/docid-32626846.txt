Mac:

1. Attached are George Ball's first batch of papers.
They are remarkable for their unanimity in thinking that
something strong needs to be done. In my judgment, attach-
ments 1, 6 and 7 are worth reading. The rest add Httle. os,

2. I have asked George Springsteen in George Ball's

. absence to see if we can get copies of the State papers promised

by the end of the day today so that the President can look at them
overnight. If, failing this, I think he might look at the three

I mentioned plus a one or two-page summary I will pat on top

of it. I will let you know further on this later today.

3. Do you think there is any point in talking with George
and Ros for a few minutes at 9:35 or 9:40 before the large

meeting convenes?
