Mr. Papich stated that the Bureau would like to have him subjected
to a polysraph examination by this Agency and would appreciate receiving
word as soon as possible as to whether we will handle the natter since
if we vill not handle it the FBI will have to determine what other steps
uigat be taken to see that this is done. I advised Mr. Papich that I
would check into the matter, that I did not kmow whether we had available
at this time a polygraohn operator who could properly handle this matter
but in any event I would let him mow whether this can oe done.
