Miami, Dec, 25, 1963

Dear IRMA,

I hope that you and your family are well when
this letter reaches you,

A few days ago, I received your letters in New
Jersey, but since I left for Miami with my friends on
Saturday, in order to stay thero two weaks and to take care
of some business, I did not write until I got here.

I want to tell you that there was some difficulty
with the vitamines, because the company which was supposed te
send them could not do so and I had to find another agency
to. do it because nobody wants that merchandise, due to tie
confiscation of the packages, but I was able to find ono
and I sent them to you, and I hope that you will notify me
as soon aS you get them, because this is a new agency
for me, .

 

 

Iam glad that I am able to do that favor becaute
I think as much of that boy as I do myself.

Tell my uncle FRANCISCO that his nephew from liexic
going to write to him and is going to send the IMMA letter t:
your. address .

I will tell you about KENNEDY's death in the othe:
letter when I am in New Jersey. All that is a ?.

Steps are boing taken for your uncle to be able t+
get out of Mexico and I think that it will be possible to get
the visa soon,.and to have him hero.

I am not saying anything to you about Miami
because I do not want to draw any conclusions yot."

Well, IRMA, write to me at my address in Koy Jerse
as usual. Regards to the whole family.

Your brother in Christ,
(Signed with initials that look like J,u.)
