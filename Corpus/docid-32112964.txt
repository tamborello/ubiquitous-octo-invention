MEMORANDUM FOR; PHIL BUCHEN

 

 

 

FROM: THE PRESIDENT

 

In the intelligence evaluation currently underway, both in the
Congress and in the Executive Branch, I would be grateful if you
would direct special attention to two areas that have raised questions
in my mind, Please assemble this information independently and

provide it personally to me, together with your recommendations.

The first matter relates to the Warren Commission. You will
recall that Bill Colby mentioned to me certain assassination attempts,
sponsored by the Agency, on Castro. As I recall, this conflicts with
what I recall was some of the information furnished to the Warren

Commission. The Warren Commission, as 1 remember, addressed

 

 

this question to see what, if any, relationship there may have been

to attempts on Castro, which would cause rataliation against Kennedy.

If you could review the record in the Warren Commission on this point,

it would be helpful. As 1 remember, those of us on the Commission

got the impression the Agency has never engaged in such activities ain |

Castro, Dave Belan might be able to shed some light on this entire

“question and I would be interested as to his recoilection on this subject.

The second area in which I would like you to get some additional
information is onthe A zotian: Matador Project. When did it begin?
What is the relationship with Hughes ?# I first learaed of this program
after I was well into my Vice Presidential term. In fact, Admiral
Anderson of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board suggested that
I raise it with the Agency when I visited there. There was-only one
short briefing and that did not go into the background of the project
which I understood had originated several years ago, The briefing
also did not go into cover arrangements in any depth.

Since becoming President, I have focused more on the status and
operation of this project, rather than the details of how it was put
together. Perhaps it might be well for you to establish just what
has been the relationship of the Agency to Howard Hughes down through
the years. Have there been other programs and projects which have

run through him or his organization?

I would be grateful for your suggestions and guidance as to how you

think we should proceed once you have assembled the information I

have requested.
