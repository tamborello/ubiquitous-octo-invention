when he stated that the. fact that the Murder of Bill
Moore, M Edgar Evers and others in’ the, south going
by without punishment had set the stage for the
Assassination of Pres. Kennedy. Everyone veadily
agreed,

Arnold Johnson further stated that no real Marxist

giving him a Citizenship im the Soviet Umion because
they thought him to be an Agent of Fascism. Genne

this phone conversation was completed She had been
quoted in the newspaper and exposed as a Communist

- party Member, which brought-about her expQ@lsion from
the. N.A.A.C.P., but simee has been restored to
Membership. Then lately a Man. (Negro) by name of Johnson
head of the local CORE group was indicted for robbing a
bus driver in Steubenville, Ohio. Genne had got in
