‘“As Kennedy told me in the last conversation,
he himself had determined the people who were to
murder him, He also told me that the people were
envious among themselves and that each fought to be
able to commit the murder,

"It was most likely for this reason that it later
came to the murder of the murderer, whose action was
begrudged him.

"J had originally predicted, and had also made
it a condition in conversations with the President,
that I would not make known the truth about the murder
to the public until half a year after the deed. I also
suggested the founding of a memorial library.

“However, Kennedy did not agree that the announcement
of the truth about the murder should wait so long; rather,
he demanded that his family be told about it in time.
Therefore, some 14 days after the deed, I informed Robert
Kennedy, who then informed the widow of the President.
Jacqueline Kennedy then sent me a telegram which stated
that she thanked me very much and was of the opinion that
what I had reported was the best solution. of the case.
Unfortunately I no longer have the telegram.”
