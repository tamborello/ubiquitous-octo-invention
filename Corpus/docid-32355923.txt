(2) Kf Subject confessed, but ODENVY does not wioh to ran euch
_acase, presumably Subject would then, on the basig of hie confeasion, he refuced
antry te the U.S. ~

. (3) If Gubject refuses te confess, becange he ia either a gocd
agent or not an agent at all, the Station can osly point out to bim that hie Mile
in the U.8. will be extremely diengreeable with this charge haaging over his
bead and let him go.

b. Te do nothing when Subject's immigration comen up. tharaby
allowing him to proceed to the U.S. unhiedered. The Station believes that this
course of action would be appropeiete only Mf ODENVY preferved te conduct an
jnvegtigation on Subject alter hie arrival in the 0.5. withoat alerting him to
suspicions on the part of the authoritics. This would be a matter which only
OQDENVY could judge. .

The possibility of cauging Subject's immigration vies te be refaged out of hand
hag not been listed gince with the evidence sow at band, it is deemed extremely
uumikely that the responsible authorities would consider gush a refusal warranted.
The Station favors the plan of action described in 7.a. above; however, Hoad-
quayters comments and guidance in thie matter weuld be appreciated. Ginco
coneultation with ODENVY will bs necessary in any case, it is requected that
Headquarters undertake discucsions now im order to reach au understanding of
hew thie cage is to be handled.

8. it would be most helpful MW BEVISION could be queried agais on the
baeia of the aew information now available, better pictures, ete. Theo Station
_ sealiges that clrcumstances protably prevent this, but it le gerieualy doubted
here that LICHOGKI 3a going to be revealed as a PIS agent witheut some
additional ammunition. Headquarters states in paragraph 9 of Reference B
that it ia probable that Subject ie maintaining contact with 2 case officer. Ia
- eaces of Polish WMegals known to the Station, euch contact hag usually been
kept te a minimum while the agent was in the staging area. if Sabjoct is
writing to the Genter from thine to time, but no? meeting a caee olftecr, tho
_ chance of dotectiag thie are exutvemoly amalleig bo le meeting a cage officer

to surveil Subject until eome final eoarae of action has boan determined. Uf
Headquarters wants the confrontation to take place, it is planned to precede

3. Ascording to LIFEAT information, Subject's wife rented a roam in
their house at Cucraavaca 452 to an American Jow mamed Hyman CAHDN, born.
circa 1902. He was recommended by Lidia by a fou LEVINSKI, who describsad,
CAHN ap intellectual, eerious, an American fram Loe Angeles who planaed to

entire gavinge in that inetisution. In a phone conversation between Subject's

wile and igsacio RICHTER, Lidia aaid that CAHN wanted to invest about $27, 600.
im Mexican banks, where he could get 10% interest. A later call to CAHN from

a Miss FLORES from Credito Burcatil indicates that CAHN is buying Mesican
etecks. The Station hag aot besa able to develop any further information on. . CAHN

4 Mail Covezags. In addition te the letter deseribed in MExI-6322,
30 Geptoember 1963, Sadject haa received the following lottere:

a Letter dated 4 October 1963 from Subject's daughter, Krystjan,
writing from Warsaw. Subject apparently gave big daughter the mosey for a ;
two-week trip to Viemna, and she writes a vary fond thank-you letter to him upan
hey return to Wargaw.

7625 Carlyle Avenue, Miami Beach, Florida.

a. The ea gact ia the catire cace which is moat susceptitic of
investigation Je the alleged trip Subjec took to Burege to meat hin cage officer
im late 63. carly 89. AM available sources om Subject have bean cheelted for
teformation on thie trip and have tarned eut negative, with one axception. ,
GABBOTT (ps) recalled that Subject had ateher worked fox or had been aseociated
with a Ladislaw SDROZDOWSKI during the early part of hia etay in Mexico and
therefore might know lukether ba had beea. out of the country for aay length of time.

b. PRACES: According te Station files, DROZDOWSEI wag bora on
28 April 1995 in Poland. He wae a Captais in the Polish-Russian Army (aie) -
during World War 3% and entaesed Meaieco in January 1944. Because of bie failure
to vogistar properly, DROZDOWSKI was ordered by the Moxicas Goverument ta
leave the country in 1948. (Mote: He ds still here.) Source alleged that when.
DROZOGWSEK! entered Mexico, he had connections with the Polish Legation,
bul sovered these comnections, posaibly duc to fimancial matterg. Subject clalme.
te ba a veternarian. (Seurce: LIBIDO, 2) April 1943.)

@. The LIFIREs were seat out to interview Mr. and Mra. DROZDOWSKI
who own a clenaing ostabliabment ia the Polanco area of Mexico. According to
the statements of DROZDOWSKIa, Subject never worked for them, but had sought
assistance from them circa mid-1938 when he act up his causage-making shop
soon after hie arrival in Mexico. The D's did aot thiak much of Gubjest and
stated that they thought he might have lef the country te go to Ierael cometime
im mid-1959 for the purpogs of getting married. 1s ia difficule to evaluate thiz
information at present, ao it is not cleae from tho seport whether the LIFIREs
lod the DROZDOWSEK1e im thely questioning. It aight have been that the D's
would “remember” such a trip if they thought & might get Subject into trouble,
since they ebviowsly disliked him. The LIFIREs will be sent back to the
DROZDOWSHIe for more detailed discussion of thie alleged trip. The alleged
nmrriage is clearly falae -- Subject wae married to Lidia heza in Mexico on
12 Jane 1962.

 

 

7. The Station is now faced with the probability that there will be ne:
breakthrough im this cage before Subject’s immigration application comes up
for processing. At that time, it ecems to the Statlen that the peseible coursea
of astionars:

a. To call Subject im for as interview and put prancare oa him to
confese his agent statuo, then try te recrait kim to work in place in the U.S.
for a sam of measy. Given Subject's very ehaky Unancial statue, elnce bia
money ie all tied up in land apeculation, it is felt that money would act as 2
vury strong incentive fer him to accept recruitment. Lf be agreed, it would then
be necessary for ODENVY to be invelved in the case. Therefore, if thid ccusea
of action le ddemed appropriates by Headquartera, it ia requested that ODENVY
be queried now ag to whether they weald want to rum such a case in PBPRIME.

od Since the preparation of reference C, the Station has instituted telephone ;
coverage of Subject, intercepted his mail, made inquiries about possible trips
outside of Mexico by Subject since his arrival, and puraued other leads which -
are described in more detail below. Ali of thie detailed investigativa’effort
has not thus far developed concrete proof of any clandsatine activity on ‘the
part of Subject, although it is certainly possible that open code messagea __
are being passed by mail or by phone. The one possible exception is described
in paragraph 6c below <- a faint indication that he may have left the country _
in mid-1959.. WEGRZYN was rechecked in HBFINCH files, but there istetill —
