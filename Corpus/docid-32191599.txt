, RE: ASSASSINATION OF
a JOHN F, KENNEDY
HOVEMSER 22, 1978
DALLAS, TEXAS - ~

this encounter, Sturgis stated that he had killed John F.
Kennedy. Wiser stated that he asked Helt “Why would Sturgis
dmpart this interesting bit of news to Holt who was a

known government witness and publicized DEA informant from
the past?" And Holt replied that it was “ one hit man to
another". Wiser advised that Holt had indicated an intention
to go te the news media regarding his allegations against the
DEA, Wiser further stated that he.thought it likely that
Holt would also make mention of the Sturgis comment, in that
he had reported this to DEA, and that they had done nothing
about it. Wiser adviged for this very reason he wrote a memo
concerning what Holt had reported, and for this reason it was
furnished to'the Secret Service.

Wiser made available a copy of this memo dated
Getober 4, 1978, which is attached.

Wiser further stated that in a case in which Holt was
a witness for the prosecution Holt had allegedly called a
Gefendant during a trial and told him he was going to “get him”.
The defendant in this matter, at the time of the call, had a
recording of his telephone call made which was played for the
presiding judge. Holt denied making the call to the defendant,
and the judge ruled that Holt's testimony could not be permit~

ted.

On November 9, 1978, Wiser had advised that Bill
Johnson. was William J. Johson, date of birth March 11, 1931,
FBI number 133677¢c, last known address 1898 N.B. 118th Road,
Miami, Plorida. : : .

On November 31, 1978, Wiser advised that Holt had
been polygraphed on three eccasions by DEA on November 30, 1978,
and he had failed the three polygraphs concerning his allegations
about DEA. . ; ‘ ;
