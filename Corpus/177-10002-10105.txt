missile submarines and the re-
assignment of their crews to
new Y-class units have probably
been at least partly responsible
for the decline in ballistic-
missile submarine activity. In
addition, the loss of a G-class
submarine in the Pacific in mid-
March apparently resulted ina
three-month standdown in patrols
by these units. That incident
probably caused the Soviets to
implement new safety measures.

Moreover, as the Soviets prepare ~

to deploy new Y-class submarines,
they may be reassessing the
military value of sending their
diesel-powered units into the
mid-Atlantic and mid-Pacific
patrol areas.

Some of the submarines on re-
cent patrols have also engaged
in other activities such as
hydroacoustic research and
support of naval training ma-
neuvers. J-class diesel-powered
cruise-missile submarines ap-
parently have. been used primarily
for peripheral defense. In
late 1966, the first of these
units to venture into the
Mediterranean broke down and

older W-class units are equipped
to launch cruise missiles, but
these, too, operate only near
Soviet shores and probably are
being retired from service.

Recent patrols by diesel
attack submarines in the Medi-
terranean have been extended
to as long as six months through
the use of Arab and Yugoslav
ports for upkeep, reprovision-
ing, and crew recreation. Pre-
vious patrols by Soviet sub-
marines in the Mediterranean
had lasted less than two months.

Last year, a submarine
support group operated for nearly
six months off the west coast
of Africa in a program to study
the feasibility of submarine
operations from a floating base.
The group consisted of a sub-
marine tender and a missile
supply ship, and was assisted
briefly by a survey vessel and
two intelligence collection
ships. Several other ships
provided logistic support. Four
submarines participated in the
group's operations. One of
these-~a nuclear-powered unit--
was away from home waters for
more than six months.

Once the new ballistic-mis-
sile submarines go on patrol,
the Soviets may make greater
use of such floating support bases
on the high seas. Floating base
ships would be vulnerable in

Deployment Patterns

Soviet submarines are as-
signed to each of the four
fleets~-Northern, Pacific, Bal-
tic, and Black Sea. Because
of the restricted exits from
the Baltic and Black Seas, how-
ever, most of the missile-
equipped units and all of the
nuclear-powered units are based
in ice-free ports of the Kola
Peninsula (Northern Fleet) and
in the Pacific Fleet.

The Soviets are apparently
trying to reduce the dispropor-
tion between the two major :
fleets~-the Northern and the
Pacific. Although the North-
ern Fleet still holds the favored
position, several nuclear sub-
marines have been transferred
under the polar ice to the Pa-
cific anda number of modern
diesel units have joined the

Northern Sea Route convoy in
past summers.

The Baltic Fleet is re-
sponsible for protecting Soviet
coastal waters and for furnish-
ing diesel submarines for pa-
trols off the US Polaris base
at Holy Loch. Moscow has also
begun sending Baltic Fleet sub-
marines to the Mediterranean to
take some of the strain off the
Northern Fleet, which has been
furnishing most of the units
operating there. There are no
nuclear submarines in the Bal-
tic, and the few cruise-missile
units there operate in coastal
waters.

The Montreux Convention
of 1936 places severe limita-
tions on the passage of Soviet
submarines through the Turkish
Straits. Black Sea - based
submarines can pass into the
Mediterranean only if they are
headed for another fleet area
for repairs. For this reason,
only older diesel units are
based in the Black Sea. Once
in the Mediterranean, however,
these units operate there for
about 60 days on their way to
and from Baltic shipyards.

Patrol Activity

Most of the increase in
the level of Soviet submarine
Operations during the past year
is attributable to the station-
ing of a force of six to ten
submarines-~mostly diesel attack
units--in the Mediterranean since

THE DEVELOPING SOVIET SUBMARINE FORCE

The Soviet naval leadership, commanding the .
world’s largest submarine fleet, is undertaking a pro-
gram to increase the operational capabilities of the
force. Four new classes of submarines—three tor-
pedo-attack classes and a new Polaris-type missile-
firing submarine—are in production, and several older
classes are being improved and reconditioned. In ad-
dition, since the early 1960s the range, number, and
duration of open ocean patrols by Soviet submarines
have been generally increasing.

Fleet Modernization

The new Polaris~type sub-
marine--designated the Y-class--
carries 16 SS-N-6 ballistic mis-
siles with ranges ofsome 1,500
miles. These 425-foot-long sub-
marines. are currently being built
at Severodvinsk in the Soviet
Northern Fleet area. The first
units should be operational soon
and 40 or more could be in serv-
ice by the mid-1970s.

‘Two new classes of nuclear-
powered attack submarines are
also being built--one at Lenin-~
grad shipyard and the other at
Gorkiy. At least one of these
classes probably was specifically
designed to engage enemy subma-
vines. A third class of attack
submarine is under construction
in the Soviet Far East; its means
of propulsion is not yet known.

In addition to these new con-
struction programs, the Soviets
are reconditioning many of their
older classes of submarines.
There are no indications that
the Soviets intend to introduce
a new class of cruise-missile
submarine, however, and con-
struction of these submarines
is apparently ending as the
Soviets approach their desired
force level for these anticar-
rier units.

carried on the older ballistic-
missile submarines, but are
within range of the SS-N-6
carried on the Y-class. By

the mid-1970s, Soviet ballis-
tic-missile submarines may
present a strategic threat com-
parable to that of the US Polaris
fleet and be able to operate with
less risk of detection than fe
earlier classes of Soviet mis-
sile submarines.

The introduction of the new
classes of attack submarines
suggests that the Soviets are
attempting to come to grips
with the Polaris threat. The
Soviets apparently are counting
on their submarines to help
blunt that threat by attempting
to destroy Polaris submarines
before they can launch their
missiles.

Soviet ballistic-missile
submarines frequently patrol
within range of US Polaris
bases and could destroy a num-
ber of Polaris submarines by
attacking these bases. The
new Soviet attack submarines
may be able to locate and de-
stroy a few Polaris submarines
in confined waters through which
those submarines frequently
must pass, such as the Irish
Sea or the Sicilian Straits.
Combined operations with new
Soviet surface ships, such as
the Moskva-class helicopter car-
riers and Kresta~ and Kashin-
class guided-missile ships,
will provide some antisubmarine
capability in the ocean approaches
