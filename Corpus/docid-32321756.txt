Title: POLICY FOR INFORMANTS/ASSETS
UNDER THE JOHN F. KENNEDY
ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION
ACT OF 1992 (THE ACT)

Synopsis: OPCA requests the Criminal Informant/Sensitive
Information Unit, Criminal Investigative Division (CID), the
Asset Unit, National Security Division (NSD), and the
Administrative Law Unit, Office of the General Counsel (OGC)
review current policy regarding informants and assets and provide

guidance for compliance under the Act. fh FWO-M24 fore 4%

Details: In 1992, Congress signed the Act mandating federal
agencies to release all documents concerning the presidential
assassination or information related by conspiracy theory to the
assassination. The Act narrowly defined the types of information
that agencies could still protect by postponement until the year
2017. The Act also established the Assassination Records Review
Board (the Board) as a separate entity to oversee the release of
material from federal agencies to the National Archives and
Records Administration (the Archives). Beyond the Board’s
oversight responsibilities, the Act charged the Board with the
duties of reviewing agencies’ proposed postponements presented
with evidence for approval or denial. Their decision weighed by
the damage to the agency’s program compared to the public’s need
to know. In addition, the Board researches new leads for any
relevant information concerning the assassination. Since the
Board’s inception, the FBI has been working closely with them to
achieve the public enlightenment of the assassination as defined
in the Act.
