to be a Communist and, at the time of this report (1962),
was not considered to be one, He attended artillery
schools in the United States (dates and places unknown) and

stated that Major Jose Ramon FERNANDEZ was the Chief of the
Seccion Preparacion y Organizacion Combativa (Section for
the Preparation and Organization of Warfare - SPOC), the
Cuban Army's key man for defense against invasion, and the

: military brains of the country. He had access to all secret

information, FERNANDEZ received his instructions exclusively
from Fidel and Raul CASTRO with whom he is in personal contact.
He received his military education in the United States. He is
intelligent and reportedly not a Communist.

aka “El Gallego," has an office on the ground floor of the first
building as you enter the camp. FERNANDEZ and a General Enrique
LISTER prepared all the training schedules, pamphlets, and
training aides, as well as joint exercises in which air ground
(armor and infantry) have participated.

1s completely within the confidence of the Soviets with

respect to the military fortifications of the Habana area.

[,  , a report dated 18 May 1963,

A fairly reliable source, in a report dated 7 August 1963,

stated that she dia not think FERNANDEZ was a Communist as. he
has always had Catholic tendencies but that he is a correct
soldier and puts the military above everything. He is divorced
and his ex-wife is living in Miami with their two daughters,

- Francis, born in 195i, and Alicia, born in 1955. ,

A source who is a high ranking Cuban @ilitary officer who has
good contacts among Cuban officials (he has not submitted many
reports, but they appear to have been accurate) reported in
September 1963 that Najor Jose Ramon FERNANDEZ Alvarez, Chief

.of Training, Generai'Staff of the Cuban Rebel Army, is anti-
‘Communist and a military type in the strictest sense of the

 
   

word. He sticks to his military duties aad scrupulously.
avoids politics; he keeps himself completely isolated ftom
all political elements. He is proud of his present status
and thankful to CASTRO for it; for fear of losing it he
appears utwilling to undertake any kind of activity against
the CASTRO regime. CASTRO is undoubtedly knowledgeable of
FERNANDEZ’ attitude and has sufficient confidence in him to
retain him in his present position. CASTRO also is aware fo
that he has few offacers with the milatary discipbine,
know-how, and experience possessed by FERNANDEZ.
