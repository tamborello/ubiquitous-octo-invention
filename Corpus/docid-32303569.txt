On 12/29/62, President John F. Kennedy visited the Orangé
Bowl Stadium, Miami, where he reviewed the returned prisoners of
Brigade 2506. He was accompanied by Jose Miro Cardona and Manuel
Artime, both of whom_wer n the speakers' stand with President
Kennedy. fm 033-8) 15)

After Artime's “return to the US, he used his influence with
the US Government to obtain an interview with President Kennedy in
Palm Beach, Florida. He was to continue as head of the MRR. Artime
made a good appearance, spoke English, and had charmed US Government
officials who were in charge of government policy between the US
and Cuba. He was extremely ambitious and would like to be the head
of the CRC and probably the future President of Cuba. (Higinio
"Nino" Diaz, supra, 1/4/63). ly

As a result of nationwide press, radio, and television
coverage of President Kennedy's 12/29/62 activities at the Orange i
Bowl, which coverage prominently mentioned Artime's name, Artime
now was better known and his position in the anti-Fidel Castro :
movement was greatly increased. Generally among Cuban exiles Artime )
ng

was considered young, immature, and highly ambitious, and many felt
that he would be the victim of his own publicity. eum 639-S, 1/5/63

tractor exchange deal were the three leaders of the invasion -
Manuel Artime, Jose San Roman and Rafael Bolivar Fuentes. The
Cuban Government proposed the exchange of Artime for Francisco
"The Hook" Molina, a pro-Castro Cuban who had been convicted of i
second-degree murder in NYC. However, this proposed exchange failed |
to materialize and in late March - early April 1962, in Havana, Cuba, |
the prisoners were tried before a 5-man military tribunal and con-
victed. The verdict involved heavy ransoms with the ransom for i
Artime set at $500,000. Subsequently, the US carried out negotiations i
for release of the prisoners and on 12/23-24/62 they all were air-
lifted to Miami. Artime, the civil representative of the CRC, re-
portedly had emerged as a focal figure in the exile community. At :
a press conference on 12/25/62, he emphasized that all the returned 1
prisoners regarded themselves as the "troops of the Revolutionary . i

Manuel F. Artime Buesa; (2) a military group under Major Ricardo

leadership, the majority of the CACU membership joined with the :
Rebel Army Officer group to become the MRR. In February, 1950, a . i
