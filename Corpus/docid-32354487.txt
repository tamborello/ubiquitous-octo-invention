SUBJECT: Latin America Division/JFK Task Force How

Research was Conducted |

1. The LA Division Task Force to investigate records
in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy
was formally organized in mid-October 1976. Its purpose,
basically, was to research all Agency operations conducted
against Cuba from 1 January 1960 to 1 January 1965 . ,
(concentrating on the period up to 22 November 1963) for
any evidence that such operations might have provoked the
“Government of Cuba to take executive action against
President Kennedy. Researchers were also alert to activities
seemingly directed against the U.S./CIA. .
2. Reference to material for this research was obtained
from the LAD Registry, the Cuba Desk machine runs, and a
special comprehensive file listing prepared for this purpose
by ISS (Information Services Staff). It was originally
thought that material pertinent to the search would number
“approximately 900 operational folders, plus‘related 201 )
dossiers. .It was later determined, however, that a thorough
review should include additional operational and subjective:
files which brought the total to well over two thousand files.

In-view of the date of the material, much of it, both operational

b. Criteria Used in the Research:

 

As a guide the research group followed some
33 Terms of Reference provided by the Deputy IG, which”

were compiled on the basis of issues raised in Book V,

 

HW 53199 DocId:32354487 Page 3
 

of the Senate Select Committee Final Report on the
Assassination. (Book’V, and a 23 May 1967

Memorandum for the Record by the Inspector General

on Plots to Assassinate Fidel Castro, were required

reading for the researchers.) In addition to the

Terms of Reference, the group remained alert to other

items of interest brought to its attention by the IG

staff, on an ad hoc basis. A name trace was always

run, and/or 201 dossier, if available, reviewed, on

any individual allegedly involved in an assassination : ‘
plot against President Kennedy or Fidel Castro. This

task was made somewhat easier as the result of a

memorandum prepared by the Cuba Desk, in August 1975,

based on traces of the names in the Black Book. that

Fidel Castro passed to George McGovern which dealt

with individuals allegedly involved in assassination
attempts against Castro. )

c. Findings and Organization of the Findings:

 

Each researcher submitted a draft paper noting the

Subject of the folder (s) reviewed, a brief description of the
activity, and a copy of the document (s) (findings) which

_ contained information believed to be pertinent to the re-
view. Also included were Job numbers, Official File
numbers , “inclusive dates Of material researched, and
number of volumes reviewed. Beginning in January 1977, at
the request of the IG Staff, the researchers also began

noting FBI and/or other government agencies knowledge of
