tg 25/26 November): :
lieved to be terminated. The alert, ap- :
parently prompted by President. Kennedy's death on 22 November, was possibly pre-
scheduled to terminate on i:5 November. There have been two orders which sugsest
that the alert vas destined to be concluded on 25 November: They aret :
1) Access to the coastal observetion post at Punta Naisi (20-15% Th-O9W) was |
restricted until 25 duvember because of the alert. '
2) Subordinates of Banos, Headquarters Eastern Naval DMstrict, were to receive
further orders on the 25th, presumably concerning their alert status; n° such orders

have beon noted in communications. :
There bave been no further references in intercepted commmications to the r
alert since 0222% on 23 November.
It is possible that the restricted access
Naisi extends to othar observation posts in Grien
22 Hovenber when First Arny Coastal Observation Posts were placed in alert status,
and that the restriction was to be lifted sa 25 November by all those posts. ‘
Further indications that the alert was terminated is the fact that the Cuban
Havy was engaged in ap island-wide comepications exarcine on 25 November, It is
considered unlikely that such an exercise would be conducted uncer alert conditions.
There have been no further references to the alert status of the (D Percent
Santiago de Cuba) units which was first observed on 23 November. All CRAF and :
Soviet Forces Cuba Communications appear to be normal during this period, :
