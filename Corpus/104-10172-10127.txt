in this immediate area the matter was allowed to rest long enough to

rather than beating around the. bush. Then he was asked to provide
a plan for a fleet which would not be restricted to this immediate

1, SUMMARY. Three female radio operators are now in training, |.
and a fishing boat operation requiring only limited financial * Te
support is ready. to go as the result of the efforts of AMDENIM/1 in ©
this period. He has also contributed both operational and intelli~
gence information and has had some difficulty accepting the longer

_ call for him to continue fulfilling operational requirements in the

fishing organization which would provide cover for various types of

intelligence activity.

operator candidates to the Station for training was completed by
Subject during this period, This involved two side trips from. New -

3. AADENIN/1- continued to handle AMTRIGON/2 during this. period
in the senso of holding iim eccure fullivwediag his Sucecesfel exfiltrae
tion from the target aren, He served as a leg man and made a number.
of supporting contacts and investigations during the period which
assisted ANDENIM/1 and the Station in their overall efforts. AMTRIGON 2
has now indicated a desire to return to the target area, His plans are
being checked out, ANHELM/1, 201-328512, was put on the payroll at
AMDEXIY/ 1's suggestion after much deliberation, As a long time target
area gun runner he is probably the most experienced "fisherman" in the

~ business and well worth a nominal.retainer each month for tho operatio:

qualified agent’ who. would be much more damaging to the’ Station if "s
caught. He is by no means a fully controlled or trusted agente. He

is.a tool who is manipulated through AMDENIM/1 by never explaining

- 4. Regarding internal contacts of ‘AMDENIM/1: on learning of the
well being of AMEPOCH/6 via mail to regular correspondents following
the October crisis an SW message was sent to him early in February

_ requesting that he signal via telegram code when he is ready for a
reception and ‘that ‘he send out SW letters on a regular-basis to give
us the benefit of intelligence available to him, .-No Ply bas as yet
been received,’ This is in part due to his being in’Camaguey and —
probably fiot having received the letter (etter sen “His home in

6. On about 29 January AMDENIM/1 called from New York City
to say that ne wanted to stop by Washington D.C. to see a few
people that he hadn't seen for a long time. He was advised that
this was contrary to Station desires and that it was. not in his
best interests. Despite this advisement he went to Washington with
his friend AMPATRIN and did seo representatives of both ODACID and
KUBARK (under cover). His explanation of this was that he had gone
along with AMPATRIN to Washington for business purposes and despite
his objections had been finagled into the two meetings by AMPATRIN.
He was informed that this was not believed and that the incident
had lowered considerably the degree to which the Case Officer was

_willing to.accept his word on anything. Beyond that it is felt :
that he managed. to let off a little steam and confirmed that his onl

Hogan turned up like a bad penny during the period-and ‘made a few
inquiries. from pecple like ANDENIM/2 as to what Subject: was doing.
No significance other than that of "fishing expedition" which
failed to turn up anything could be attributed to this visit. Sub-
ject's father has threatened to cut.off his monthly stipend presua-
ably on the basis that he is complicating life for. AMBUD/1 by not
joining him, He has heard from the Internal Revenu Service about
his application for tax exempt status for his Cuban relief fund and
is providing the additional information they have requested. He
