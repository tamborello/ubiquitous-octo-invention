February 25, 1958, by SA ROEMER. These individuals
‘have expressed willingness to fully cooperate with

this office and have never refused to do so. However,
they have been of very little assistance. They continue
to point out that they are not in a position to know

of ALEX'ts comings or goings, his activities, his
associates, or anything else which may be of assistance
to this office. The only information they have ever
furnished has been that ALEX, as RYAN, continues to pay
rent for an apartment there. When ALEX was being sought
by this office as a missing witness of the Senate
Rackets Committee, they advised only that someone,
unknown to them and in their absence, paid ALEX's rent
every month by dropping cash in an envelope on their
desk. They have advised that they are unable to find
ALEX®s application for the apartment which he executed
when he moved in. They have also advised that they do
not know whether ALEX keeps a car in the garage stall
which he pays rent on. In summation, they profess
cooperation but have never gone out of their way to
obtain any information and it is suspected that they
could furnish more if so inclined.

concerning [______] above, it ts
reported herein that R ONGTREE, who is now under

deve i as a PCI, advised that he knows that ALEX
pays o report visits of FBI Agents to the
Murr artments, and that it was who
told that he had better not co ith

cooperated with this office, he furnished substantial
information concerning ALEX, including identifying
information regarding the chauff eur-bodyguard of ALEX,
"BUTCH" LADON, the cars LADON drove, taxi numbers, and
he also furnished information about the comings and

goings of ALEX and his wife a thei isitors, although
not on the large scale that was able to. .

On May 20, i Giddings,
an elevator operator on the & T to PM shift
~ at 4300 North Marine Drive, was contacted by SA ROEMER.

He furnished some information regarding ALEX, but not
much. He was contacted once or twice a week from
May 20, 1958, until July 22, 1958. During that time,
ALEX and his wife were not at their residence, due to
the fact that ALEX was evading a subpoena of the Senate
Rackets‘Committee. During that time,| i advised :
that he had not seen ALEX or his wife, but on each - . a
contact he promised that as mon as he observed that
ALEX or his wife had returned to their residence, he :
would immediately so advise this office. He gave no ;
indication that he would not fully cooperate with this
office in that matter. ‘This continued uhtil July 22,
1958, when independent information was received that

* ALEX and his wife had returned to Chicago. He was
contacted that date and he advised that he had not seen
either of them but again promised that as soon as he
did, he would immediately contact SA ROEMER telephonically.
On the evening of July 22, 1958, after Mrs. ALEX had -
been observed at her residence by SA ROEMER,
was recontacted by the agent. He advised again a e ,
had not observed either ALEX or his wife, and then
stated that he was "not going to talk" to the agent
.any more. When asked for a clarification of his attitude
and the reason for his apparent change of mind,
would only say that he did not want to be "found inan . i
alley some night." He stated that it was SA ROEMER's j
job to keep in touch with ALEX and not his, and that '

on July 30, je North

shift, was contacted. He agreed to furnish information
regarding ALEX and did so on that occasion. He was
most cooperative on that occasion and noted that it.was
a civic reponsibility to cooperate with an organization
like the FBI, and that he knew his identity would be
fully protected. He agreed to recontact by SA ROEMER,
but stated that he did not remain in his rented room
only to sleep, and that he had no phone there. He
suggested that he be recontacted on the following —

conversation of the evening before, but that

called, she was not to advise that he was there and
to state that she did not know when he would be there
again. She stated that he informed her that someone
at work had talked to him and told him that he had
better be careful, that if he was to talk to the police
or the FBI, that he'd get "knocked in the head." He
