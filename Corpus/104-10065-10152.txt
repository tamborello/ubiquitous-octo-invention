on 28 June 1973 and as modified in the interim period. It
is the first step of a three-phase, long range reorgani-
zation program designed to enable the Directorate to conform
to the perceptions of the Executive and the Congress as to
the Directorate's role, to adjust flexibly to changing
strategies and priorities, and to make most efficient use of
personnel and material resources allocated to accomplish the
Directorate's mission. .

GENERAL

is comprised of the Office of the DDO and its special staffs,
the Senior Staffs, and the Area and Functional operating
Divisions. (See Figure 1, attached.)

the DDO, and report directly to him and/or the Associate

ment of a Clandestine Corps responsible for the
