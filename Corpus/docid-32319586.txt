Memorandum D. Ryan to. Mr. Bailey ‘ ‘
- Res House Select Committee on Assassinations :

Appendix-Volume XIII ~ MLK.

Item 1: On page 117, last paragraph, the panel

> report, in paragraph 32, lists the results of fingerprint
comparisons on numerous photographs. In paragraph 33, the -
panel report states that the HSCA panel, in examining these
reports, agreed with earlier findings of the FBI. However,
the report stated that "In addition, the panel: determined
that the previously unidentified photograph 115, developed”

. from a coupon from Eric 5. Galt to Modern Photo Bookstore,

a bears an impression made by the left thumb of James Earl Ray."

‘It was pointed out to Mr. Blakey that this sentence
is misleading and incorrect in view of the fact that the FBI
initially-identified photograph 115 as an impression of Ray's — a
left thumb, and therefore the HSCA only confirmed this finding. .

Mr. “Blakey agreed to make the following changes in
the report: (1) On page 116, under photograph 115, the Q
number of 326 was added in parentheses following the word .
“Store”; (2) on page 117, information concerning the identifi-
cation of photograph 115 would be listed in the correct chrono-
Logical order under. paragraph 32; (3) the sentence in the-last
paragraph on page 117, in paragraph 33, beginning with "In
addition," would therefore be deleted.

. Item 2: -On page 127, bottom of the page, under item te) +
_ there. appears the sentence “The FBI received this specimen
‘from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on June 4, 1968." -

The FBI objected to inclusion of this information
because it disclosed the FBI's relationshipp with a foreign
intelligence service. Mr. Blakey agreed to delete this
sentence. ; . . : ot

Item 8: On page 240, paragraph 7, the report states
that the FBI’S Conduct was “morally reprehensible, illegal,
felonious, and unconstitutional.“ The FBI objected to this

_gtatement in discussing the FBI Counterintelligence Program.
because the HSCA, in its report, failed to point out suffi-
cient evidence to warrant such language. Mr. Blakey refused
to make any change in this statement. . uo ,

“Washington instructed the FBI legal attache in Ottawa to con~
duct a similar review of Canadian passports, with-the assis~
