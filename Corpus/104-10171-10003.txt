(fnu), the FEU Secretary General in PBRUNEN, AMHINT=33 added in ~ ‘.
his S/W Message 11 of 10 Docember 1962 that “his friends” are still

in jail,

6. Reference E tranamitted a ictter written by AMHINT-33

on 29 December 1962 in which he states that G-2 infiltration is so

Great that he considers it impossible to organize anything, am he
indicates that some of the agents, os in this cane, have been infile
trated for more than two years, He presumably means infiltrated \
into anti-CASTRO organizations and/or activities.

 

ates 7. Relative to the “other groups" mentioned in para, 1
above, ANHINT-33's Case Officer believes that AMHINT~33 is probably
we preferring to the MRR, the MRP, the MDC and the 30th of Novembor«.?

offer little concrete information.

"a. It is noted that Jorge MEDINA ‘Bringuier is listed

on Page 13 of Attachment C to UFGA-1977 as an MRR member, with #
listed aka of Carlos PRADO. JNNAVE tracing identifies one Carlos
PRADO as “a brother uf Raul, the head of G-2 in Las Villas Province," ]-
as-reported in HAVA-6437, 5’ October 1960; there is no further informa
tion on this Carlos PRADO. However, the original source of the iaforg
ation given in Attachment C of UFGA-1977 was a letter brought out .
of PBRUMEN by AMSTRUT-1 about early July 1962. Said letter contained
a $25 money order, issued at Station No. 9, New Orleans, on
16 March 1962, for Jorge MEDINA. Bringuicr and purchased by Maria
Teresa MEDINA, The envelope, addressed to Sra. Consuclo.C. de
RIVAS in Mexico City, bore the notation, “For Carlos PRADO," and
contained a note, “This money order for $25 is for Carlos PRADO
from his mother," in addition to the moncy order. There is one

' Carlos PRADQ in Mexico. Ne is studying engineering and is. the BY .
brother of<fayatinb-PRibo ba arcia, an engineer who works close to fa wt

"Che" GUEVARA Sand is of currgnt KUTUBE interest Faustino PRADO |, a
is married to Clara ARTIME, 73 sister of Josefina “ARTIME, who is |} +
a close friend of AMGLEN-9,, and she is also of current? KUTUBE interest

when AMSTRUT-2, who could have given this letter to AYSTRUT-1 to |;
“take out of PBRUMEN, was in Mexico City she called Carlos. PRADO by ©
telephone at 249769 and told him that she was.a frien@ of his mother.
This PRADO family is a large one, and includes anothe, brother, 4
Angel, who is ia Spain,’ a sister who is a nun in Ita¥y, and anothen
brother who is a2 doctor in New York City. Additiona] data could

be secured on this yy from AMSTRUT-2 if desired.{ However, it
seems probable that this money order may have been ebid in Cuba -
by Jorge MEDINA and ‘purchased, sooner or later, by th e mother of the
Carlos PRADO sho ig currently a student in Mexico. copy of the .
