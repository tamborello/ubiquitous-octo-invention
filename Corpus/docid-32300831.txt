LA 92-113 C
LA 4268-C has furnished the following information:
On 8/14/64, ROSSELLI was not at the Friars Club.

On 8/17/64, ROSSELLI was at the Friars Club and
told informant that he had sold his Pontiac Grand Prix
and he is now driving KATHY's (KATHY HORDEN) car. He said
he was not going to buy another car at this time. . HERMAN
SPITZEL was at the Friars Club. SPITZEL related that he
had recently been at the Del Mar races and resided at the
Torrey Pines Motel. , -

ROSSELLI was at the Friars Club on 8/18 and 19/64,
but nothing of unusual interest occurred.

On 8/20/64, ROSSELLI arrived at the Friars Club ; i
about 6:00 p.m. and while there received a telephone call.
After he hung up, ROSSELLI asked informant if he could get
three tickets to the Beatles performance in Los Angeles on
Sunday, 8/23/64. ROSSELLI said he just received a call
from a very important person in the Democratic Party, who i

. is close to President JOHNSON, who wanted three tickets

for his children. ROSSELLI | said, "You wouldn't believe i
it, iff told you who it was". Informant endeavored to get H
three tickets for ROSSELLI without success.

s

At this time, BILL SMITH, an official at 20th
Century Fox Studios came to the Friars Club and ROSSELLI
asked him: if he could get three tickets. SMITH said he
would try to do so. .

On 8/21/64, ROSSELLI arrived at the Friars Club
at about 5:00 p.m. with MOE GENSER. A few minutes later
BILL SMITH, above mentioned, came in and delivered three
tickets to the Beatles performance to ROSSELLI. The cost
of the tickets was $30, which ROSSELLI offered to pay, but
SMITH declined to accept the money. SMITH said he was
waiting to take HERMAN SPITZEL to dinner.

}

ROSSELLI told JONIE TAPS, a Columbia ‘Pictures
employee, to call KATHY and tell her to come down to the
Friars Club. TAPS did so and when he returned, told ROSSELLI
that he was to call HARLEY HARMON at Newport Beach and gave
ROSSELLI a number ‘to call. ROSSELLI said it looked like a
wrong number, but made the call and it turned out to be the
wrong number for.HARMON. HARMON is a close associate of

ROSSELLI, who is in the insurance and banking business in

Las Vegas. \
