Central Bureau, Criminal Division, Italim National Police, Rome,
advised that he has determined that the articles referred to in
rrelet of October 21, 1963, were articles which appeared in the
Palermo, Italy, daily newspaper "L'Ora", rather than in a Rome
daily newspaper. Dr. MANOPULO stated that the articles in "L'Ora"
of Palermo were identical with those which had appeared in the
Rome daily newspaper "Paese Sera" and which have already been _—
furnished to the Bureau.

On December 23, 1963, Dr. MANOPULO stated
that repeated efforts by the Italian National Police to date to
locate NICOLO GENTILE have been fruitless. Dr. MANOPULO said
that he feels it is very possible that GENTILE has, left wep LS

was most grateful for the time and effort which were expended
in the preparation of the material furnished to him. He stated
he would keep this office advised of all pertinent information
developed concerning the organization of "La Cosa Nostra" and \
any possible ties between the organization in Italy and in the 1
United States. -

In connection with this latter point, on
December 5, 1963, Dr. MANOPULO stated that the Italian Police
are somewhat gratified by the slight crack which appeared in
the wall of silence which usually surrounds Mafia activities
in Italy. The crack appeared during a trial of several accused
murderers in Palermo, Italy, when one of the defendants fur-
‘nished a‘statement confirming the existence of Mafia gangs and
giving the names of those guilty in a number of murders which
had taken place in the area. None of this information had
any connection with possible international links of "La Cosa
Nostra", but the situation has, perhaps, lessened the fears
in the hearts of those who may have such pertinent information
to furnish.

 

. The Rome office is continuing to follow
this matter closely and any pertinent information developed
will be promptly furnished to the Bureau.
