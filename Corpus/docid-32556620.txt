GUS. ALEX

The Swiss Central Police Bureau, Bern, Switzerland
has furnished the following information:

The Geneva Police have reported that ALEX and
DIETGARD FUEGER stayed at the Hotel Richemond in Geneva,
Switzerland, between January 6 and 8, 1965, and checked in
again on January 12, 1965. The couple left the hotel on
January 13 with flight tickets to Athens and requested that
any mail should be forwarded to the Hotel Bristol in Paris.
It appears that the journey to Athens was short-termed,

. While staying at the Hotel Richemond, ALEX and
FUEGER made the following telephone calls:

No, 32 68 00 Swiss Rent-a-Car, Geneva (several calls)
No, 34 15 15 -Spycher's Swissways, Geneva

No. 31 21 30 Cook's Agency, Geneva

No. 32 06 06 Veron Grauer Co. (Garage Riesbach, Geneva)
No. 25 83 50 Air France, Geneva

The 1964-65 teléphone directory lists SPYCHER's
Swissways as an auto rental service.
