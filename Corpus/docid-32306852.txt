could have easily said something out of turn. He believes, [
however, that PETRO was too experienced to get trapped =~ ia
easily and that, in his opinion, whoever killed him was i
known, to PETRO. i

The informant also pointed out tke possibility
that the killing also could be-connected with the murder
of PETE-DI GRAVLO-of Cleveland. (For the infermatdon. of
Ios Angeles, on‘10/23/68, the Cleveland Office advised that
DI GRAVIO was killed by #ifle fire on 6/21/68 while playing
golf in the Clevelahd area. Four shots were fired into him
by an unknown assassin from the woods adjacent to the golf
course. Since the early 1960's, DE GRAVIO had operated
a shylocking business in Cleveland under the names, MDM
Investment Company’ and DMM Investment Company, both located
on Mayfield Road Hill in the heart of the Italian community.

‘The Cleveland informant advised in 11/66 that
JULIUS PETRO, the former Cleveland bank robber,, moved to
los Angeles after release from prison, and had come back
to Cleveland for a conference with DI GRAVIO regarding
the heading up of a loan shark business in Ios Angeles with
his brother, MIKE,

DI GRAVIO had visited the Los Angeles area on
several cccasions, and his son resided in los Angeles, DI
GRAVIO's son, WILLIAM, was arrested on 1/6/67 in San Diego
for possession of marijuana and In Los Angeles on 2/8/68
for robbery. In May, 1968, PETE DI GRAVIO spent several
weeks in California and eventually brought his son, WILLTAM,
back to Cleveland with him.

. One Cleveland source advised that, in his opinion,
DI GRAVIO was killed as a result of something that happened
in California. during his last visit, but could not be more
specifit.

. Tt should be noted that, when SD 1064.C-TE visited
St. Louis during December, 1968, he contacted Cleveland
