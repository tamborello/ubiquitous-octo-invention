Madrid 92-7

 

 
 

‘

The. writer questioned the caller at several different
times as to his identity and each time received the reply that .
the caller was the "Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy in Pardela)

Inasmuch as the Madrid file on this matter reflected
that Assistant Legat KEENAN had handled coverage on the subject
in November 1961, -when the subject was in Madrid, through
Mr. LUIS POZO GONZALEZ of the Directorate General of Security,
actual surveillance of the subject having been arranged by -
Mr. POZO with the Alien Brigade of the Directorate General of
Security, Mr. POZO was contacted on 12-22-61 and requested to
verify whether the call concerning the subject and the other
two individuals had originated with his office or with the
Alien Brigade. Mr. POZO subsequently advised on the same date
that the call had not’ come from his office and that he had
checked with the Alien Brigade. and’ had been told that no call
had been made from that offic LY)

Inasmuch as Mr. HAROLD MOSS, U. S. Treasury repre-

_ sentative in the Embassy in Paris, had previously expressed

an interest in this matter, the Paris Office was telephonically
contacted on 12-22-61 to ascertain whether the information
contained in the telephone call may have originated with

Mr. MOSS. The Paris Office subsequently advised on the same.
date that contact with Mr. MOSS and his office in Paris had
failed to develop any information indicating that they were
responsible for the call. £23 |W) Le as

The Madrid Office is presently endeavoring to verify
through Mr. POZO whether EMIL ARNSTEIN and ROBERT SCHIFF
actually arrived in Madrid on 12-23-61, it being noted that
reference, Bureau cable indicated that subject GIANCANA, had
been in Chicago and that there was no indication that he planned
to return to Europe in the immediate futur ¢g) Z7(vd

; .The Madrid Office file on this matter reflects that
one JAVIER OCANA of the Alien Brigade of the Directorate General
of Security was the one who apparently handled the surveillance
on the*subject in November and who reported on .the matter to
Assistant Legat KEENAN. A copy of this letter is being sent
direct to the Paris Office with the request that Mr. KEENAN
advise whether he recalls if the telephone number of the direct
line in the Madrid Office, 2 26°61 99, was furnished to OCANA wv)
in the course of his investigation of the subject in Novembe rG

If this be the case, it would appear ‘that the possibility
might exist that the call-on, 12-22-61 originated with OCANA./5 o
