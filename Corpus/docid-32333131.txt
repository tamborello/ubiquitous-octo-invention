and, under a pretext of trouble-shooting, would survey subject's
telephone facilities. At a predetermined time the test
“center would then remove the trouble to indicate that the
surveying agents had located the trouble. Several days later
‘the test center would again throw trouble on the subject's

line and the agents would then make it known that the old

twist pair drop line would have to be replaced. Thereafter,
this line would be replaced with a four conductor line to

be installed by the agents in conjunction with telephone
company personnel who would be selected by the Special

Agent's office. While this line change was being made a
modified 500 series instrument that had been previously
modified would be substituted for mictel coverage.. Inasmuch
as the subject is security conscious it is believed that this
method of penetrating his residence could be accomplished. :

Bureau authority is requested to immediately initiate tesur
coverage.

SUBJECT HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR CARRYING CONCEALED WEAPONS;
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS,

TO: DIRECTOR, FBI (92-2940) DATE: 11/7/61
FROM &b-sac, PITTSBURGH (92-226 Sub 2) JUNE 7

SUBJECT: SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, aka.
ANTI-RACKETEERING
(00 - Pittsburgh)

i

' ReBuairtel to Pittsburgh, 10/31/61, stressing the necessity Le
for developing additional highly confidential. sources to ‘ |.
penetrate LA ROCCA's activities in line with LA ROCCA having {
been designated the "Big Boss" while national top hoodlum, :
VITO GENOVESE, is in jail. I
At the present time this office has Mutt coverage on LA ROCCA's
private office at the North Star Cement Block Company, ~
12 McCandless Avenue, Pittsburgh, but due to the infrequency
of his visits to his office it is believed that additional
technical coverage of his residence might be more productive.
Sources and informants agree that LA ROCCA has no other
established offices or meeting places and it is possible
that his residence may be the scene of decisions affecting
major criminal activities.

In connection with the survey of LA ROCCA's residence for the
purpose of effecting technical coverage, the following was
ascertained:

Subject owns and occupies a stone mansion situated in a wooded’
tract of land at 900 Ingomar Road, Ingomar, Pa., a suburb

of Pittsburgh, which is located at the corner of Ingomar Road’

and Brant Avenue. The house faces on Ingomar Road and is

set back from this road at an approximate distance of 275 feet
while the driveway enters off Brant Avenue and runs for an vie

   

gapproximate distance of 125 feet from this avenue to the houg¢. |
At the present time these premises are occupied by LA ROCCA,
his wife, and a maid and yardman who are employed full time
and are loyal to the subject.

Subject has private residence service, telephone number
Forest 4-5296. This service consists of one main telephone
instrument, one wall phone extension, and one portable
(phone-jack) extension, all instruments being of the 500
series and serviced by a single twist-pair drop line.

The instruments are serviced by Aerial Cable 6, Pair 198, '
which is lead sheathed and egressed from the Forest Central oo. Loe
Office Exchange into the immediate neighborhood. The working iz
, appearance of Pair 198 appears in an outside terminal box res
attached to pole 6/3 which is located on Brant Avenue and - i
directly across the street from subject's driveway. At the ’
working appearance Pair 198 is fitted into a two inch pipe :
which goes underground and into subject's residence. In is
this connection subject's power lines also appear on the :
same pole and are egressed into subject's residence through
a similar pipe. Pair 198 reappears in an outside terminal
box attached to pole 5/6 which is located on Lindsay Road
at a distance of 2,212 wire-feet from pole 6/3. This is
the only multiple of this Pair.

All known ways and means of establishing technical coverage
have been carefully considered. In consideration.ofiall
aspects of technical coverage involving the technical
problems, security consideration and investigative advantages,
the following conclusions have been reached:

1. Although no information has been developed to indicate
that subject is actually using his residence for activities
relating to personal contacts, it would appear that he
considers his residence to be secure and might conduct other
activities there, particularly in regards to telephone
contacts.

2, Inasmuch as the power and phone lines servicing his

- residence are engressed into his residence through underground
conduits from pole 6/3, which is an estimated distance of 125
feet. from his residence, it would be a major problem to
install additional underground wires for conventional microphone
coverage... ‘ :

3. The use of the RFMT unit is not feasible since. the lead
aerial cable cannot be broken between the working appearance
and the multiple and the multiple is located 2,212 wirec
feet from the working appearance. :

4, The use of the SPMT unit, although feasible, necessitates
looping Pair 198 through a monitoring plant which must be
located between subject's instrument and the Central Office.
Such an arrangement would require a local monitoring plant
and additional monigtoring personnel.

5. Due to the nature of the steel and cut-stone construction
of subject's residence and the distance between his residence i
and a point considered to be secure for installing the Vega bees
receiver, it is believed that the Mutt's range would be ao
reduced to the extent that the signal would be lost.

In view of the above factors the following proposals are
being made: -

1. A tesur be initiated immediately with the bridge being j
made at the multiple on pole 5/6. This coverage would

appear to be secure due to the distance away from subject's

residence, it can be initiated immediately and monitoring

would be done at the Pittsburgh Office control plant. It ‘

is suggested that this tesur be maintained for a period of

several weeks during which interim an evaluation could be

made as to whether the subject utilizes his residence in the
operation of his activities and thereby justifying the need

for additional technical coverage at his residence.

2. During this interim arrangements would be made to effect
SPMT or mictel coverage if it is ascertained that additional
technical coverage of subject's residence would be warranted.
In regards to the use of the SPMT with its limitations, it
would be necessary to obtain moniotiring facilities in the
proximity of pole 6/3 or pole 5/6 in order to loop Pair 198
through this unit. The alternative would be to run additional
wires into subject's residence by way of his phone conduit.
In connection with the latter the local telephone company's
cooperation would be solicited and through the local :
exchange's test center trouble would be thrown on subject's
line and maintained until the subject would make a formal -
complaint to the company who would in turn so notify the
sound trained agents. The sound trained agents, using the
company's truck, would proceed to the subject's residence
