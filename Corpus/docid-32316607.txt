Socialist. She said he told her he subscribes to "USSR"
and "China Today".

She said that a member of the Internal Security
Sub-Committee who had a foreign sounding name (probably ‘
A. L. TARABOCHIA, an. investigator for Senator JAMES 0. EASTLAND
of Mississippi) had contacted her concerning MOODY and
had informed her that a check had been made of the U. S.

Marine Corps and that that service was unaware of MOODY's
Socialistic sentiments.

 

.. Mrs. HOGAN advised she had no » knowledge of MOODY's
involvement with Cuban exiles and regarded this possibility
as extremely remote since he is reportedly a paraplegic.
She said it is her understanding that his condition is
not a result of military service but rather a result of
"bends" developed while skin-diving. She said he may
receive a partial disability pension from the Government
but does not believe he has any employment. She said his
wife! s name is ALETA.

The files of the Miami Office contain no other
information relating to either REYNOLDS MOODY or any
COLONEL MOODY identifiable with Cuban. activities in Miami .

; Inquiries made of MM 492-S,. MM 635-S, MM 639- -s,
MM 873-S, MM 974-S, and PSI JOSE T. MEDINA, all of whom are
familiar with phases of both pro and anti-CASTRO activities
at Miami, resulted negatively.in obtaining information
concerning any COLONEL MOODY.

D) No information is contained in the indices
of the Miami office relative to the subject's wife, ALETA.

E) ‘The identities of relatives of REYNOLDS MOODY

F) The present sympathies of REYNOLDS MOODY
are a matter of conjecture based on reports that he
writes liberal political views to Miami newspapers
and reportedly receives the magazines "USSR" and ;
"China Today", It is anticipated that interview of
REYNOLDS MOODY would resolve whether or not he is .
identical with the COLONEL MOODY, who has been reported
by TP 139-S as being involved in some type of operation
against CASTRO in May or June (1964). It is recalled -
that TP 139-S had advised that at a picnic held on
4-26-64, by members of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,
Tampa Bay Chapter, ROBERTYSBRAUER had mentioned in
general conversation t he had heard from a COLONEL Fle
MOODY in Miami and MOODY had informed him that there
would be some type of operation against CASTRO in May or
June.

, On 7-30-64, the Tampa Office advised that
recontact with TP 139-S resulted in no additional

‘information which would identify MOODY or the operation

other than BRAUER had quoted. MOODY as naming the action
"Operation Condor". TP 139-S advised that no one asked
BRAUER any questions concerning this matter, and BRAUER
did not elaborate. TP 139-S said BRAUER gave the
impression that MOODY was a personal friend.

Tampa advised that COLONEL MOODY is not known
to Tampa indices or other Tampa sources.

In addition to resolving REYNOLDS MOODY's knowledge
of or involvement in the alleged operation against CASTRO,
it is anticipated that information will be elicited concerning ~
any knowledge or association he might have with the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee and ROBERT BRAUER in particular.

With respect to any mention that will be made of
BRAUER, care will be exercised to protect the identity of
TP 139-S.
