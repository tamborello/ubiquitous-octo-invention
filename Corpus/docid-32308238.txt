; . A review of the newspaper morgue of The Arizona Re-
public disclosed an article written in the February 22, 1963,
issue of the paper, This article is set forth verbatim as
follows: : ; ; :

"I @id just what I had to do.” "And what did Ricardo
Diaz have to do? oo

"Fashion a knife from a spoon, kill his prison guard,
and navigate 100 miles of open sea in a stolen sail-
boat, ; :

"But it freed the 31-year old Diaz, now 4 Phoenix auto-
mobile salesman, from thé Cuban revolution he embraced
. before it turned down the Communist path.

"Now Diaz, whose full name is Diaz-Lanz, is afraid
someone will consider him a hero.

"It was expediency," he said. "I was like a pig in a
pen. I had to get out. It was my brother who was the
hero,

"His brother ig Maj. Pedro Diaz Lanz, chief of the
Cuban air force “who became disenchanted with the
revolution in July 1959 and told the world of Fidel
Castro's ties with communism.

   

"Ricardo was a social worker in the Castro regime. He
was thrown into prison without explanation. He was
beaten and kicked. Some of his ribs were broken,

has a master's degree in sociology.

, "But he took no part in the abortive revolt of July
26, 1956, at the Havana police barracks; nor in
Castro's landing after his return from exile.

"In fact, his family had been ariong the favorites of
the Batista regime, and Ricardo had a paper-shuffling
job in a Havana government tourist agency. |

"Ricardo said:

He doubts that Castro had any Communist help until
after his successful return to Cuba from Mexico, He
ianded with 17 men and meager supplies.

"Gastro didn't need any help from Russia,

-"Cuba was overwhelmed with hatred of the Batista
regime and ready for revolution. It had been talked
up by the students and young intellectuals of Cuba
for years. : :

"But there was no leadership, no planning. Castro
didn't provide it either.

"But the sheer audacity of his attack on the police
barracks tabbed him as a man of action. And his suc-
cessful return three years later madé him the man of
the hour.

"By the time Cubans learned he had betrayed them to
communism, it was too late. ,

"So what are the plans of a learned young man with a
