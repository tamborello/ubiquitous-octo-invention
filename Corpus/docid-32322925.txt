DETAILS OF PROPOSED INSTALLATION

. Pursuant to Bureau authority, dated February 12,
1964, a survey was conducted to determine the feasibility of
effecting misur coverage on subject's private office at
the Ken Iron and Steel Company, 1263 Third Ave., New
Kensington, Pa.

The Ken Iron and Steel Company is located in the
twelve hundred block of Third Avenue and fronts cn this
avenue, while the rear of the enclosed yard bounds on
Spruce Alley, running east-west between Second and Third i
Avenues and terminating at the east end of this. yard. i
Residences on both Second and Third Avenues are telephonically i
serviced through a lead-sheathed aerial cable traversing the
north side of Spruce Alley from west to east, which terminates
on utility pole #19319 immediately benind the yard. From
this utility pole the cable is dropped into the company's
office's cellar where it terminates in a twenty-five “protector-
paired" box, five pairs of which service the office's various
individual télephone numbers. The location of this office
is approximately 16 wire-miles from the Pittsburgh Office
Consolidated Plant.

CS PG 187-S advised that a cable-record check
disclosed. several line pairs which could be made available
for use. One pair was selected (Pair 847) and on testing it,
measured 2,055 chins with a db loss of &.7 over the approximate
16 wire-miles.
|

Subjects private office is located in the rear
northwest section of the first floor and has approximately
10' by 11' dimensions. The walls are pine-panel plank while '
the 10' ceiling is constructed of acoustical tile. The i
groved pine-panel planks are held in place with 4d nails to
furring strips, 24" on horizontal center. The private office
is serviced with a five-key telephone instrument which inter-
connects, in addition, with several offices and points in
the junk yard. This keying unit obviously replaced a former
number of private-line instruments. On the north wall is
mounted a 44A block. ) :

It is proposed that one mike be installed in the
northwest corner of subjects’ private office on the west :

wall at a height of 34" and a point 22" from the northwest

corner. Ingress to this area can be made by removing one

section of plank, two at the most*, senna BAS amp leads will be .
extended behind the plank, downwatidt pdiarid’ Ev cneree on :
the top interior west wall of the etter and will thereafter

be secreted to the cable outlet.

It is anticipated that the installation personnel
will enter the Ken Iron and Steel Company surreptitiously.
Prior to entry, all logical principals will be placed
under surveillance and will be surveflled during the entire
operation. Special Agent personnel who are acquainted with
the subjects and key associates will be placed in strategic
positions to provide utmost security throughout the entire
operation to insure advance warning of any approach by the afore-
mentioned persons. It is realized that trespass will occur
but every precaution will be taken to prevent any possibility
of compromise.
