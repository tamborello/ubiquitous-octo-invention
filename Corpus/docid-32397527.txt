Re. Gene F. Wilson . so

Dear Mr. Wilson: - va

 

. In response to your letter of November 30,'1976, Mr.°Harold -
Weisberg has authorized me to state his willingess to pay seaxch. -
and. copying charges up to the amount of $1,000 if such charges are!
xequired by his Freedom of Information Act request for records :
pertaining to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his assassination. - 3 jo)
_ Because you require a down payment of half the anticipated charges, ..{_.

i enclose a check for $500.00: ; re ok -

 

 

 

This payment of $500.00 and any subsequent payments niade in a
. connection with this request are tendered with the express resmrva-.
‘ tion that Mr. Weisberg does not waive his right to recover them.

  

OC. TA. regulations provide: |

Records shall be furnished without charge

or at a reduced rate whenever the Coordina-

tor determines that waiver or reduction of

the charge is in the public interest because
furnishing the information can be considered

as primarily benefiting the general public. .

The Coordinator also may waive or reduce the

charge whenever he determines that the inte-

rest of the government would be served there~

by. 32 C.F.R. §1900.25(a). 0 Lo

In accordance with this regufation, I call upon you to
Aetermine that it is in the public and governinental interest to
@ search and copying charges incurred in connection with Mr. .
berg's request. Enclosed herein is a copy of a letter to Deputy
mney General Harold R. Tyler, Jr. which makes a similar request --
the Department of Justice. The reasons expressed in that letter .
¢ granting a waiver are incorporated in my request that you grant.
a waiver. . . ; oo : :

 
  
 
   

Should you réequixe it, I will provide you with affidavits by -
f, Mc. Weisberg, and others in support of this request for a BE

 

of the search and copying charges for these records. I£ you
supporting affidavits, I would appreciate it if you would

  

 

HW 53216 DocId:32397527 Page 9
 

inform me of this as soon as possible. If would also request
that you indicate what standards, if any, you have established
for determining whether or not a request for waiver should be
granted. oo

' You state that ‘you can proceed no further with Mr. Weisberg's.
request "unless and until we are in receipt of notarized state- :
ments of release from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray,

' respectively." Because Mr. Weisberg's request undoubtedly com-
prises records which do not involve any proper claim of privacy,
“this cannot be true. I do enclose, however, a copy of a notarized
waiver by James Earl Ray. I will immediately contact Mrs. King

_about.a waiver by her. In the meantime, I request that you proceed
to make available those records responsive to Mr. Weisberg's xe- ~-
quest which do not involve any proper claim of invasion of privacy.

- Sincerely yours,

James H. Lesar |
