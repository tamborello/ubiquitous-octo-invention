that Mr. SAM and other friends had made the arrangements

that GIANCANA was currently residing in his apartment in
Beirut, Lebanon. He reportedly left Mexico some three to
‘five weeks ago. He retains his home in Cuernavaca and it

locate subject in Beirut through the casinos or golf clubs i
if he is unknown to Lebanese authorities .(; Ww ‘ i

MEX 170 advised 10/31/72 that he had determined
that the full name in the Spanish fashion for CARRETO, who .

It is noted that subject GTANCANA is known to have
frequented the Mananitas and Quintas restaurants (9) a ‘

 

The office of INS, American Embassy, Mexico City,
has been requested to check for the immigrant status of
CARRETO (&)y, :

The Mexico City daily newspaper "La Prensa" for
10/24/72 carried an article concerning the Cosa Nostra in
Chicago and mentioned the supposed presence of subject
GIANCANA in Cuernavaca, Mexico, and the fact that he was
not being bothered by Mexican authorities.(W)

 

- The same date attorney JAIME GUTIERREZ QUIROS,

' Chief of the Inspection Service, Mexican Immigration (protect),
commented concerning this article and asked for verification,
Both he and attorney JORGE VAZQUEZ ROBLES of the Department
of Political Investigations of the Secretariat of Interior,
who also made inquiry concerning this matter, were advised
that subject GIANCANA apparently has been a resident of . : |
Mexico for a number of years, in spite of the fact that the

. Mexican government reportedly has prohibited his entry into
Mexico. Both advised that they would be making inquiry into ,
GIANCANA's status in Mexico and his apparent violation of |
Mexican law.(! . ;

: In addition, MEX 170 advised that the Mexican Federal
Attorney General's office was again showing interest in subject
GIANCANA's whereabouts CEU) ;

These inquiries may have something to do with
subject's reported departure for Lebanon. WwW i

a clerk in the Legal Office of the American Embassy, Mexico ;
City. Mrs, ARNOLD was acquainted with CAIN during his !
