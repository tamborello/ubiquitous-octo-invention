\S As noted CS MEX 287 advised that subject reportedly
returned to Mexico from Chicago on about 1/11/70. However,
vax & it should be noted that source has not been in personal con
‘ \ {tact with the subject since 11/69 and is getting his inform
s Nition second hand. As :
BB & eal Nevertheless flight manifests for all international 4
Boob a a flights arriving at Mexico City 1/11/70 were reviewed and i
aS eS no reference was noted considered identifiable with the
i AS subject. Subsequently source advised that he had a report
¢ \ that subject was seen in Acapulco 1/6/70 and was believed
Q

have arrived the day before. ‘Y Aly ¢ a

On 1/30/70 source advised that he had been in“con-
tact with the LERNERs and they have been doing considerable
speculation concerning subject. They both conjectured that —
subject may have never left Mexico at all inspite of his
(jtalk of visits to the U. S. including the recent supposed /
visit. They noted ithat he has not called anyone and has not _ i
been playing golf and they had a report he had “visitors,”
Subsequently they reported a rumor that FRANKAS INATRA was MeL, -
visiting with the subject supposedly to escape service of Cali Fe me
a subpoena in the U..S. They speculated that SINATRA and --~ a [
subject are now in Acapulco probably staying at the Acapulco +
Towers under false names. There have been no card games
recently and therefore no pretext to get together. They Les
also speculated that subject has traveled to South America

and might be going back and forth forthe, Usn AS. through, nafila.
The next card game will probably, irc Mate, in February. \
