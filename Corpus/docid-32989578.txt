to Jim Adams about the. remarks made by Senator Morgan.
1 have seen him briefly since he made these remarks and .
plan te see him. next week again to talk over the reason for
these remarks at some length. As noted in his response to
you, apparently he hag come to this feeling as a result of the
_ so-called "unchallenged": matters which he has had reported
to him as a member of the Senate Select.Cammittee. It is
true that some mistakes of the Bureau were brought out, but:
the over-all performance of the Bureau has, as you said, been -.
well above that which could even be expected of us and cer-
tainly has. been most.contributory to the safety of this nation
throughout.the years.’ .To categorize us as "rotten to the cors"
and to. indicate that we are a great threat to the United States -
raigs the mark tremendously and are completely without foun-
dation: I will so inform him, but apparently he has made up
his mind and there is little ‘likelihood that we will have a
convert,

Dear Mike:

This will confirm our telephone conversation con-
cerning the procedure whereby we will make available to
you, or your designee, copies of draft reports relating
to the Justice Department. As we discussed, the pur-
pose is so that any classification (or other such
problems, e.g., the identity of informers) which may be

t

inadvertently raised in our reports can be identified.
The first two drafts relating to the FBI are ready. °
They are: ‘

1. "The Use of Informers in FBI Domestic
Investigations"; and

2. "Domestic CIA and FBI Mail Opening Programs".
(Substantial portions of which relate to the
FBI.) .
I would appreciate it if someone very promptly could con-
tact Frederick D. Baron, my assistant (224-1746) , who
will arrange the details of location and time for the
review.

_ Sincerely yours,

. . - io 2 .
