Mr. Wilcott. I do.
Mr. Preyer. I would like before we begin to read a |
written statement concerning the subject of the investigation,

We are operating under House Resolution 222, which man-

dates the Committee to conduct a full and complete. investi-

sination and death of President John F. Kennedy, including
determining whether the existing laws of the United States

concerning the protection of the President and the investiga-

tory jurisdiction and capability of agencies and departments
are adequate in their provisions and enforcement; and whether

there was full disclosure of evidence and information among

 

whether any evidence or information not in the possession of
an agency of department would have been of assistance in
investigating the assassination and why such information was
not provided or collected by that agency or department, and
to make recommendations to the House if the Select Committee
deems it appropriate for the amendment of existing legislation
or the enactment of new legislation.

That is what we are attempting to accomplish, which is
quite a big order.

We appreciate your being here today, Mr. Wilcott.

(Whereupon, a recess was taken while the members of the

| Committee went to the floor of the House for a vote.)
