Memorandum from Mr. J. M. Sturgis

to Mr. W. O. Cregar

Re: Report on Allegations Appearing in
October 14 - 15, 1979, Editions of

The Chicago Sun-Times Newspaper

DETAILS:

On 1/3/80, SAs Emil Moschella, Legal Counsel
Division, and Jim Sturgis, Intelligence Division, met with
Thomas Lattemer, Staff Director, House Permanent Committee
on Intelligence, at his request, regarding the recent FBI
submission to the Committee of a review on analysis of the
case captioned "Report on Allegations Appearing in the
October 14, 15, 1979, Editions of the Chicago 'Sun-Times'
Newspaper; Review of Pending Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) Double Agent Operations, October 1, 1977, to the
President.’ It is noted that the Committee had taken
testimony on the matter of this double agent on October 16,
1979, and the Committee made several requests for information
in the area. (S)

Mr. Lattemer advised that it was the opinion of
one of the members that a piece of requested information
had not been directly addressed in our response and he
therefore made a request for the specific item. Mr. Lattemer
said that the item appears on pages 34 - 35 of the hearing
transcript and that the requested analysis should compare all
of the items passed by the double agent over the term of his
operation with the information received by the FBI from the
double agent so that one may be weighed against the other
in a kind of "cost/benefit ratio." (S)

Mr. Lattemer requested that the analysis be in his
hands prior to the first Committee meeting which is scheduled
for 1/23/80. (C)

PURPOSE: To advise of a tentatively scheduled meeting with
Congressman ROWLAND and to seek the DIRECTOR's approval for the
meeting.

DETAILS: On 8/10/89, Congressman ROWLAND, who was appointed to
HPSCI in January, 1989, visited the New York Office to learn more of
the FBI's effort in counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and drug
enforcement. During that visit, legislative initiatives were
discussed. There was not, however, sufficient time to discuss
counterintelligence legislative proposals. Congressman ROWLAND thus
asked the Congressional Affairs Office (CAO) representative if a
follow-up meeting could be scheduled to discuss the FBI's counter-
intelligence legislative needs in September, 1989.

A briefing has tentatively been scheduled for 9/20/89 at
11 a.m. in Room H405 - Capitol.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. That SSAS MONTE C. STRAIT and JOHN S.
HOOKS, Jr., of CAO, brief Congressman ROWLAND on 9/20/89 at 11 a.m.
