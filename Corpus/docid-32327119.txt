Carvdle Hotel and the handwriting of Sgt. CHACONAS.
WARD has indicated that CAIN staged this raid for the
publicity which he received as a result thereof,

This week, five of the members of the Special
Investigations Unit of the Cook County Sheriff's Office
have been requested to appear before the Cook County
grand jury investigating these irregularities. Sgt.
CHACONAS testified earlier in the week and CAIN testified
yesterday. Newspapers today disclosed that while CAIN
‘was testifying, on 9/22/64, he requested that LOUIS
GARRIPPO, the State's Attorney's Assistant who is presenting
evidence to the grand jury, and a court reporter, be
excluded from the room so that he could give the grand
jury"secret information," It would appear that the "secret
information" would involve the information provided above
by CG 6498-CTE.

 

Lt. JAMES DONNELLY, CAIN's Chief Liatenant in
the Special Investigations Unit, and Sgt. WILLIAM MELVIN
WITSMAN are also scheduled for testimony before the grand
jury concerning their participation in the raid on the

. Caravelle Motel.

WARD has also requested that WILLIAM MORAN be’
called to testify before the grand jury. However, Sgt.
MORAN is currently attending a police school in Wastes, D.C.
tee state ef Washioriws, and Sheriff OGILVIE has, to this
point, refused to call him back to Chicago to testify
before the grand jury.

Although the chronology of events, namely, the
information received from the insurance company by this
office that CAIN was attempting to arrange for a sale of
the stolen drugs to the insurance company, and then the
raid on the Caravelle Hotel led by CAIN, would tend to
indicate the guilt of CAIN in this regard, the Chicago
Office has developed no concrete information substantiating
this. The Chicago Office likewise has developed no |
information indicating that EGAN took any bribe in order
