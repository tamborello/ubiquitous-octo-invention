JFK Board Requests

FROM: : Barry Harrelson
Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: '  ARRB request for access to
indices to CIA histories

Reference: JFK Board Request No. CIA-7,
dated 9 November 1995, item # 6

1. In Request. No. CIA-7, the Assassination Records
Review Board requested access to “all indices to CIA
histories held by the history staff of the Center for the
Study of Intelligence’. The History Staff maintains a list
(64 pages) organized by agency component of all histories
produced under the CIA History Program.

2. We have advised the ARRB staff that access, if
given, would be limited to a designated staff member and
that the review would take place at CIA. Notes taken would
be limited to JFK/assassination-related items and subject to
Agency review. .

3. We would appreciate your view by 26 February as to
the granting access to the list, particularly regarding any
equities that concern the Office of DS&T. A copy of the
list is available for review in CSI/HRG. If you have

questions, you can contact me at extension 30292 (s).
