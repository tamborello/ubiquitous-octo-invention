Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: Possible Extension for JFK
Assassination Board

- 1. This memorandum is for your information. At some point,
the White House or Congress may ask for your opinion on the
subject discussed below.

2. The JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) is
considering making a request to Congress to extend the Board’s
charter for one additional year. Unless Congress agrees to an
extension, the Board's charter will expire on 30 September 1997.
The Board, whose members were appointed by President Clinton, was
established in 1994 by legislation. The original term was two
years, but a one-year extension was granted.

3. We have been advised by the ARRB’s Executive Director,
David Marwell, that the rationale for requesting an extension
would be based on the Board’s delay in getting up to speed, and
on the large volume of records from the FBI, CIA, and other
agencies that the Board must still review.

4. Marwell expects the ARRB to decide in January on whether
to seek an extension. He said that the Board would consult with
the White House before making a formal request to Congress. We
expect the Board, as well as the White House and Congress, to try
to determine whether CIA or other agencies would be opposed to an
extension.

5. From CIA’s point of view, an extension for the ARRB

would call for a commitment to continue devoting resources to
supporting the Board’s efforts. Currently, the Agency has two
