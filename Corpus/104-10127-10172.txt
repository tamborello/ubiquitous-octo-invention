. ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES,

1. We would like to take time out in our investigation of the President's
assassination to appraise the role of the Mexico City Station in the whole affair.
Since the early afternoon of 22 November 1963; Mexico City has been the only
major overseas reporter in the case. While this is partly dictated by the
facts of Lee OSWALD's life, we have not overlooked the really outstanding per-
formance of Mexico City's major assets and the speed, precision, and perception | \
with which the data was forwarded. Here it was relayed within minutes to the ,
White House, ODACID, and ODENVY. ’

 

2. Your LIENVOY data, the statements of Silvia DURAN, and your analyses
were major factors in the quick clarification of the case, blanking out the really
ominous spectre of foreign backing.

3. We regret that we have been able to send you so little information in
return, but we have not been given much yet. We do know that Lee OSWALD denied
he had ever been to Mexico except for a jump to Tia Juana. We have quickly
‘screened the FBI report on the whole case but we do not yet have a copy for -
retention, It does not compromise your sources. Basically, what the New York
Times has printed about the report is all true.

3. We have meanwhile been flooded with fabrications » Of which the ALVARADO
story was the most troublesome. They are still coming in.

kh, You have had good support from your liaison, but as usual the really
outstanding features were Mexico Station's famous generalship and the skill and
devotion of 1ts personnel. Please convey our admiration to all who participated,
down to the last technician, translator, and monitor. We know that the work
your Station did during the President's 1962 visit made you feel this trageay
with particular keenness » as did we. :
