Subject was asked if he knew of any Cubar intelligence officer
who presently used the name "Orlando." Subject replied that Oscar
Garcia, an instructor at headquarters in Havana, does use the naime
“Orlando... This particular information may be of some interest in
connection with the case entitled "Olga Georgina Goicoechea Salas," the
Cuban agent in Mexico City who recently indicated’ “she was willing to
cooperate with the U. SJ She allegedly had contact in Miami with an
individual referred to as "Orlando."

Swenson advised that CIA is currenply giving consideration te
making recruitment and defection approaches of various intelligence
officers identified by the subject. This would be done on a very selective
basis and CIA would concentrate on those individuals who offer the mosi
potential based on data furnished by subject. Swenson commented that if
CIA proceeded with this plan there could be a strong reaction at Cuban
Intelligence Service headquarters in Havana if any individual approeched
reported the matter to his people. He elaborated by stating that once
Cuban headquarters realize that subject is cooperating with the Americans
we cannot discount the possibility that the Cubans could take steps to
protect existing operations. This could mean the recall of certain
agents. Swenson stated that he definirely will give the Liaison Agent
advance notice if the above-described recruitment and defection plan
is to be put into effect. w& :

Swenson stated that he is in the process of preparing reports

based on information furnished by the subject. These reports will be
disseminated to the Bureau as soon as possible. GA (u) -
