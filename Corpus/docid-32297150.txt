On 4-27-65, JACKSON reported that he had
contacted ISRAEL MESA and made rangements to meet MESA,
ORLANDO BOSCH, and MARCELINO:GARCIA on the night of Fria
4-27-65, at the offices of the MIRR (MOVIMIENTO INSURRECIONAL
REVOLUCIONARIO DE RECUPERACION), BOSCH's organization. On
the night of 4-27-65, a surveillance was maintained in the
vicinity of the MIRR office and while it was observed that
JACKSON appeared at that office, no one showed up.

5-7465, PSI FRANK RODRIGUEZ advised that

EVERETT. JACKEOR has continued to maintain some contact with
RAMON BAZ, 900 block of S. W. 31st Avenue, Miami, nerateve 1a)
“toa bombing mission to > Cuba but BOSCH is not intereste » LU)

Tne PSI further advised that ORLANDO BOSCH OF the
MIRR has stated that he placer no trust in JACKSON. RODRIGUEZ
said it was not clear whether BOSCH's lack of trust in JACKSON
related to JACKSON's capability for a raid or whether it

ytained to uspicion that JACKSON might have contact with
chorities ful

In view of the fact U. S. Customs is currently
utilizing CACKSON in an informant capacity and thereby
maintaining some control over his activities, no further
action in this case is contemplated by the Miami Division.
