MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY -
SUBJECT: South Vietnam

' I attach two reports which the President ought to
see. The first is a summiary by the CIA in Saigon of.the

‘current political situation (TDCS-3/552, 770). It strikes
me as being a.fair and accurate appraisal.

The. second.is a report by Maj. General Victor
(Brute) Krulak, USMC, on his recent visit to Vietnam.
It gives, Ithink, a fair and soundly optimistic picture
of the part of the iceberg which is under water, i.e. the

‘war against the Viet Cong.
