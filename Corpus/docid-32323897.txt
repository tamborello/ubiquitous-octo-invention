AR (DL 92-36; DL 162-1)

. On 5/14/61, ASAC DAVID W.. BREEN talked with
PCI JOHN MICHAEL GRIZZAFFI and he related the following:
He pointed out that JOE CIVELLO is one of the smartest

among the Italian element and it will be very tnlikely
that the FBI would find anyone who would have anything
to say concerning CIVELLO. -He pointed out CIVELLO.
-apparentiy has untold resources and that he is most
anxious and willing to underwrite any gnterprise so
long as he can be assured of a ten percent profit on
his investment. CIVELLO reportedly complains that he
is hurting financially because the trial concerning the
Apalachin meeting cost him between $35,000 and $50,000.

@ loud-mouth "Da 0" who talks too much at times and whe could
be used 4g pack ies up against the wall ta force cooperation.

PCI stated FRANK TORTORIELLO bears considerable
watching as he appears to be loaded with momey, is very
clese to JOE CIVELLO end makes frequent and aumerous trips
to Chicago (probably runner), PCI has stated that CIVELLO
has been backing the Pedigo’s Drive-In Grocery, approximately
6 to 7 throughout Dallas. He is preseatly financing the
construction of a big Pedigo Drive-In Grocery at the inter=
section of Fitzhugh and ‘Cole.

PCI stated that approximately 3 or 4 months ago he
was looking for a drive-in grocery himself and had made
prelimisary negotiations with the Metzger Dairy people to
assist in a financing of a new location. While he was
negotiating fer this new location he was contacted by JOE
CIVELLO whom he knew of previously, but did not know personally.
CIVELLO told him that he had heard that he was interested in
going into.the drive-in grocery business and that he should
deal with CIVELLO as CIVELLO could finance everything and
anything be needed. As a result ef this contact with CIVELLO
he met CIVELLO at CIVELLO'’s instructions each day at approxi-
mately 9 AM at the “pump” (Gulf Station on Ross) and they
would ride around town looking for new locations. This went
on for approximately 14 weeks. PCI stated that a decision
was made for him to open up ® drive-in grocery at the inter=
section of Inwood and Lemmon Avenue. CIVELLO would put up
$90,000 to lease the property and PCI would have to pay
$4.00 @ month rent for the property over a 5 year period
with a 5 year option for renewal, PCI stated that CIVELLO
is extremely cagey and non-committal and when he came to draw
up the contract PCI was concerned as CIVELLO’s name did not t
appear anywhere in the transaction. He inquired of CIVELLO
as to where he would stand if the thing fell through and
CIVELLO told him that he would have no worry that he, CIVELLO,
would take cave of everything for him. PCI stated that —~
CIVELLO wants a minimum of 10% profit from all investments of
this type he undertakes. Before the contract was fully
. negotiated there was some difficuity in the actual obtaining i
” of the property, therefore, PCI was able to get out of < ‘
the agreement. He was having considerable trouble by his
wife’s pressure being brought on him not to negotiate with yon
CIVELLO and this was @ graceful way for him not to deal with {
CIVELLO. PCI stated that pr QI i \
Ross Drive-In on Lemmon, w#s completely financed by CIVELLO. -
