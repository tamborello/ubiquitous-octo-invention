1800 G Street, N.W., Room 842
Washington, D.C. 20006 '

Dear Mr. Goff:

In connection with its investigation into the cir-
cumstances surrounding the death of President Kennedy, the
Select Committee on Assassinations would like to provide
the following additional identifying information on John
David Hurt:

Date of birth: 5/12/09
Place of birth: River Bend, Colorado
Social Security #107-05~-5407

The request was first made on March 1, 1978 (#85);
the Secret Service responded on March 14th indicating that
it had no files identifiable with John Hurt. We hope that
this additional data will further assist you in locating
material relating to Hurt.

Thank you for your continued cooperation.
Sincerely,

[4 Moe 2s)

G. Robert Blakey
Chief Counsel and Director
