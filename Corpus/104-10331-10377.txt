Note to: C/HRG
Subject: Meeting with ARRB Staff, 5 January 1996

. a
1. Marwell stated very strongly that without an appeal
to the President, the Agency will have little credibility.
His staff is finding it more and more difficult to defend
Agency positions. To date, the Board has been able to teil
the staff “told you so” i the strong statements made ..
to the Board concerning the Agency should appeal.
We need to demonstrate a willingness to go to the. President.
If not, Marwell expects a continued erosion of the Agency's
ability to protect information in these documents.

2. Gunn and Mary McAuliffe seconded Marwell's comments
and emphasized the need to have our best defense upfront:.
Mary said her credibility with the Board was almost shot.
They are particular concerned about the second “name day”
scheduled at the end of this month.
