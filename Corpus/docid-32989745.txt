Re FBIHQ teletype to Atlanta, Birmingham, Chicago,
Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, and St. Louis, 8/18/77.

         
 

Atlanta is furnishing FBIHQ, under separate cover,
two xerox copies each of 3250 Atlanta documents relative
to captioned matter.

   
 

  
   

3 Referenced Bureau teletype pointed out that nl! ey
House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) which is
investigating the assassinations of JOHN F. KENNEDY and

: E MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., had requested access to investigative

   

files of recipient field offices concerning the Bureau's

investigation of the assassination of KING (code name MURKIN)..

FBIHQ instructed that recipient offices using
the criteria set forth on page 2 of referenced teletype,

      

|

yi furnish FBIHQ with two xerox copies of the MURKIN investigative
Ig file.

ii
in Based on the above, Atlanta noted that it had
(& a main 44 file on MURKIN, namely 44-2386, consisting of

 
 

ae

23 volumes (2495 serials), plus subfiles B (1 volume -
: bulky exhibits), C (1 volume - xerox copies of Atlanta transmitta

AT 66-2242

In addition, Atlanta had a racial matter case on the assassination
of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., Atlanta file 157-3094 which

consisted of 3 volumes (266) serials and appears to have

been a repository of information regarding KING's assassination,
the KING funeral, etc., prior to the opening of the Atlanta

44 file on MURKIN.

Atlanta has reviewed all the above files and volumes
and two xerox copies of each serial in these files are being
sent to FBIHQ as requested by the Bureau:

Atlanta file 44-2386 on MURKIN consisting of 23
volumes and 7 subfiles:

VOLUME 1

Serials 44-2386 - 1B-1 through 6
1 through 47

marked 47)
48 through 125

LA 44-1574

It should be noted that serials 748 and 908,
located in Volume V, are missing. A review of this
volume failed to locate the missing two serials, and
Los Angeles is unable to determine whether they are
misfiled or the serials in Volume V were misnumbered.
