VANDERVETTER is married to the daughter of the owner
of Rembrandt Frocks, a dress company in NYC. The name of this
individual is not known to the informant. However, the
informant stated that the father-in-law of VANDERVETTER is
completely alienated from VANDERVETTER and regards him as an
individual only interested in his daughter's money. VANDERVETTER
reportedly withdrew all the money available to the: daughter
and is apparently trying to arrange for a large mortgage on a
home owned by the daughter in Harrison, NY. a

BURNS is reported to be lending considerable sums of
money to VANDERVETTER. The informant theorized that this money
is undoubtedly being put out in the form of shylock money and
that repayment for such loans will undoubtedly come from the
proceeds of the mortgage obtained by VANDERVETTER. In the
event this maneuver does not materialize, the informant is of
the opinion that GRANELLO will endeavor to exert pressure on
Rembrandt Frocks, through the intercession of VANDERVETTER's wife
with her father,

Since the informant is directly involved with the
subject and VANDERVETTER in this matter, this information has not
been included in the details of this report.

On several occasions on 2/13/64, N¥ 3936-C advised
SA VERICKER that he had been in contact with the subject and
the subject was still undecided whether or not to defy the
court order. However, late in the afternoon of 2/13/64,
GRANELLO finally decided against any travel to Puerto Rico.

with the informant in this matter, this information has not been
ineluded in the details of instant report.

During February, 1964, NY 3936-C advised SA VERICKER

a loan for this company. ‘The informant stated that an associate
of his had loaned Avon Wreckers $20,000.00 and the latter had
