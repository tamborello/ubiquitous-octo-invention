Harrelson directly. As usual, they will provide you with
the specific information you need as quickly as possible to
continue to record CIA's compliance with the JFK Act.

As to your request for a complete description of the
steps CIA has taken to respond to specific requests, I
understand that there are several outstanding requests. HRG
has assured me that these requests have been discussed with
your staff and responses will be provided to you as quickly
as possible. Given the number and breadth of the requests
that are being made by the Review Board and the limited
Staff resources available to CIA to process such requests, I
ask that the Review Board ‘continue to prioritize all its
requests for information or‘documents. With the Review
Board's priorities established in this way, the Agency can
immediately work on those requests that are most important
to the Review Board. Of course, as CIA responds to these
requests, HRG will provide any information the Review Board
needs as to how the searches were conducted. I believe that
this method will best meet the needs of the Review Board and
will allocate CIA's limited resources in the most efficient
manner possible.

Finally, as to your requests to interview CIA officials
responsible for this Agency's compliance with the JFK Act,
Mr. Pereira has always been available to the Review Board
for informal discussions ag well as for giving sworn
testimony including depositions. CIA has never objected to
the Review Board deposing or interviewing informally any of
its current or former employees and has, in fact,
facilitated such interviews. You will also recall that, on
6 August 1996, Messrs. Pereira and Harrelson gave sworn
testimony at an open hearing of the Review Board.

I trust that this responds to the concerns raised in
your letter. Of course, if you should have any questions
regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact

 

 

jan attorney in the Office of General
Counsel, at (703) 874-3124.

With every good wish, I am

Sincerely yours,

5. Compliance Depositions. Starting on or about August 1, 1997, the Review

Board; pursuant to its statutory authority, may conduct depositions,
under oath, of the Agency Compliance Official along with any other
agency officials with responsibility for complying with the JFK Act. The
decision to take a compliance deposition of an agency will be made ona
case by case basis, taking into account the importance of the agency to the
work of the JFK Act and the sufficiency of the agency's efforts to account
fully for its compliance with the JFK Act. In the event that the Review
Board decides to commence a compliance deposition of an agency, the
responsible agency designee(s) will be expected to testify under oath with
respect to any and all issues relating to the agency’s record search,
including the scope of the search, the identity of files searched, the
destruction of any relevant records, and any other matters set forth in the
Final Declaration of Compliance. Any person obligated to appear for a
deposition under oath shall be fully entitled to obtain legal representation.

We look forward to receiving your initial response, by December 9, that designates your
Agency Compliance Official and includes your statement regarding your position with
respect to the provisions outlined in this letter. To the extent that you have any
questions or suggestions regarding the Compliance Program, please do not hesitate to
contact our General Counsel, T. Jéremy Gunn, at (202) 724-0088.

Thank you for your cooperation with our work.

Dear Mr. Marwell:

The Director of Central Intelligence has forwarded to
me your 27 November 1996 letter. for response. .I commend the
efforts of the Review Board and its staff in reviewing and
releasing hundreds of thousands of United States Government
documents for greater public understanding about the
assassination of President Kennedy. I also confirm the
Central Intelligence Agency's commitment to continue working
closely with the Review Board in carrying out its statutory
authorities.

With regard to the requests made in your letter, I
understand the Review Board's desire to demonstrate to the
public that it has carried out its duties thoroughly and
diligently. You have requested that CIA appoint an Agency
Compliance Official to be responsible for ensuring CIA's
compliance with its obligations under the JFK Act. The DCI
has full confidence in Mr. John. Pereira as Chief of the
Historical Review Group (HRG) and has determined that Mr.
Pereira will continue to act as the CIA official responsible
for ensuring full compliance with the JFK Act and will
remain the Agency's focal point with the Review Board...

Youhave also requested that CIA provide an Initial
Statement of Compliance. Mr. Pereira and Mr. Barry
Harrelson, tthe senior review officer for HRG, as well‘as the
rest of the HRG staff, have always been available to you
without restriction. ‘The Review Board and your staff have
been provided access to any relevant documents or
information you have requested. As you know, the Review
Board was fully informed ‘as to the steps CIA took to
designate Agency records aa part of the President Kennedy
collection. HRG has also arranged for multiple briefings by
senior CIA officials from a wide variety of CIA components
so that the Review Board can better understand the
information it is reviewing. Given the current effective
yvelationship between HRG and your staff, ghould you require
additional assurances of this Agency's compliance with the
JFK Act, I suggest that you contact Messrs. Pereira and

The Review Board has recently considered how it, along with the relevant federal
agencies, can best demonstrate to the American public that a thorough, good faith, and
diligent effort has been made to locate and release all remaining assassination-related

_ records within the control of the United States Government (and that the Government is

not hiding any such materials from public disclosure). Pursuant to the Congressional
mandate under the JFK Act to “create an enforceable, independent, and accountable
process for the public disclosure of such records,” 44 U.S.C. § 2107(2)(a)(3), the Review
Board seeks to have the relevant federal agencies provide a complete and specific —.
accounting of their efforts to locate and release assassination-related records, including
a full explanation for any destruction of such records.

Accordingly, the Review Board requests that each relevant agency adhere to the formal
compliance program (hereinafter “JFK Act Compliance Program”) outlined below and

‘ devised by the Review Board pursuant to its powers under Section 7(j)(1)(A), (B), (C),
: (D), and (F) of the JFK Act. We hereby request that you undertake the following

measures by the dates provided (these dates were set in view of the fact that the
Review Board's operations currently are scheduled to expire on September 30, 1997): |

 

intent tn comply with the fF Act We request that oy December 9, 1996,
your agency designate an Agency Compliance Official who ultimately will
be responsible for ensuring that the agency has complied with its
obligations under the JFK Act, including the identification, location, and
organization of assassination records and the transmission of those
records to the National Archives and Records Administration (“National

Archives”). . Although the Review Board assumes that Mr. John Pereira or
Mr. Barry Harrelson will serve in this position, we nevertheless await
your formal confirmation. If necessary, your agency may designate
additional persons with knowledge of the measures that have been
undertaken to locate assassination records.

We also request that by December 9, 1996, the agency convey its
agreement to adhere to the compliance procedures outlined in this letter.
To the extent that any compliance procedure described ‘below appears to
be unreasonable or to present difficulties that we may not have
anticipated, please explain why and make alternate suggestions to us.

Re: The Central Intelligence Agency’s Compliance with the JFK Assassination

Dear Mr. Deutch:

Since 1994, the Assassination Records Review Board (“Review Board”) has been
working with a number of Federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency,
to locate and publicly release records related to the assassination of President Kennedy.
These actions have been taken pursuant to The President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection “Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) (“JFK
Act”). We have been working with Mr. John Pereira, Chief, Historical Review Group

. and Mr. Barry Harrelson, Senior Review Officer, Historical Review Group of CIA and

have appreciated the cooperation we have received.

The purpose of this letter is to request your agency’s cooperation in assisting the
Review Board in discharging its responsibility of assuring Congress and the American
people that the goals of the JFK Act have been accomplished to the greatest reasonable

" extent. We want to assure the American people that the United States Government has

identified, located, and released all records relating to the assassination of President
Kennedy. Indeed, one of the paramount purposes of the JFK: Act is to certify to the
public that the United States Government is not withholding relevant materials related
to the assassination. See, e.g., Assassination Materials Disclosure Act, H.R. Rep. No. 102-
625, Part 1, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. (1992) (“The Federal Government's fdilure to release
official materials has contributed to numerous conspiracy theories and fueled charges of
government complicity in the assassination . . . a salutary purpose is served in opening
these files [relating to the JFK assassination | to allay the suspicion of government
cover-up. ”).

agency’s compliance with the JFK Act (“Statement of Compliance”),
setting forth the steps that the agency has taken to locate and process
assassination records. The Review Board recognizes that many of the
relevant federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, have
previously written letters to the Review Board apprising it of their
progress at various stages of identifying and processing assassination
records under the JFK Act. The Statement of Compliance, while it may
include information previously reported to the Board, is to be the agency’s
comprehensive and final report to the American public of what it has
done to locate records relating to the assassination. This Statement of
Compliance shall include, to the fullest reasonable extent, the following
information:

a. A complete description of all steps that your agency took to
identify and locate assassination records including, but not limited
to, an identification of the major record collections and files that
‘were consulted in the agency’s search, any departmental file
indices consulted, the names and titles of the persons who were
responsible for conducting the searches, the physical locations of
the records that were searched, the off-site storage facilities (e.g.,
Federal Records Centers) searched, the specific steps that were
taken to locate and retrieve materials in archives, and.any other
criteria used by the agency to locate assassination records.

b. A description of the steps that the agency took in direct response to
specific requests of the Review Board to locate certain additional
records or information relating to the assassination. In particular, .
we ask that the CIA describe what specific steps it has taken to
address the following requests: CIA-9, Publications and Analytical
Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated March 6, 1996 to Mr.
John Pereira); CIA-11, Silvia Duran’s Original Statement (See David.
G. Marwell letter dated May 3, 1996 to Mr. John Pereira); CIA-12,
JMWAVE Materials (See David G. Marwell letter dated May 22, _
1996 to Mr. John Pereira); for HTLINGUAL records (See T. Jeremy,
Gunn Memorandum dated October 1, 1996 to Mr. Barry Harrelson);
and for Monthly Operational Reports on Cuban Exile Groups (See
Manuel E. Legaspi Memorandum dated October 17, 1996 to Mr.
Barry Harrelson).

c. To the extent that any assassination-related records have been
destroyed by the agency or any agency official, a full and specific
explanation of the circumstances surrounding the destruction of
such records.

d. The status of remaining work that you can now identify that needs
to be completed by your agency in order to comply fully with the
JFK Act, including an identification of the categories of records
that must be processed and transmitted to the National Archives, a
description of ary additional searches for files that must be done,
and the projected date(s) for completion of these tasks.

 

Shortly after the submission of the. agency’ s written n Statement of
Compliance, we ask that the Agency Compliance Official (as well as any

- persons who helped prepare the agency’s initial Statement of

Compliance) be made available to the Review Board for an interview
regarding the location of agency assassination records. The interview will
be used as an opportunity to resolve any outstanding questions regarding
the agency's search, including any follow-up tasks to be completed by the
agency. The Review Board anticipates that these interviews will be
conducted in January 1997.

nal Ag ance. By July 1, 1997,
Federal agencies al are re expected t to complete the process of identification,
location, and declassification of its assassination records at which time
they should submit to the Review Board a final declaration certifying,
‘under oath, their compliance with the provisions of the JFK Act (the “Final
Declaration of Compliance”). Because of the volume of CIA records, such

a “final” statement may not. be practicable at that time. However, wedo
expect that CIA will provide a complete status appraisal by July 1, 1997.
This final declaration shall set forth all of the information initially set forth
in the initial Statement of Compliance and shall also supplement the initial
Statement of Compliance by detailing any further steps-that were’
conducted by the agency in identifying and locating assassination records.
The agencies’ Final Declarations of Compliance will be included in our
final report to Congress.
