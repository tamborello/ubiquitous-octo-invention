page 144 The author. claims MI-5 identified the Krogers as
the Cohens before the arrest by comparing photographs of Krogers
and the Cohens and that the FBI confirmed this fact.

._This is completely false. (it was only after the
arrest when the fingerprints of the Krogers were compared with
the fingerprints of the Cohens which we had furnished to the
British earlier that an identification was made ."](s )

page 149 The author states that.a locket found in the
shop of Cohens contained a microdot which was a newspaper
article concerning the Abel. case.

: ; Again ‘this is wrong. A locket was found,
however, it contained photographs and no.microdots. __

SYNOPSIS: .

: This memorandum reviews :a book entitled /*The\War- Within"
_ written by. Coner\Clarke, British author, and dealS-with the .
Lonsdale and Cohek cases. Bufiles negative on Clarke.

t
By letter 6712/61 Legat, London; furnished a copy of wx
"The War Within." A review of the book reveals it is full of ly
inaccuracies, erroneous assumptions, and conclusions and other — SS
_items which are outright lies. He mentions the FBI in one place SS
,in a derogatory fashion. The author claims we had seen Morris and S
jLona Cohen meeting with Colonel Rudolf Abel and had investigated >
zAbel but Abel's cover was so good we decided he had no espionage .
connections. As a result of this, the author states "... FBI '
had slipped up -- and badly." This statement is pure.fabrication Q
and has absolutely no basis in fact. It is an obvious attempt S&S.
to shift the blame to the FBI for the fact that the Cohens = ©
operated in England for over six years without being detectedy

This book appears to be thrown together hastily in an

This is not correct. Fuchs’ name and
British address were in Halperin's notebook.

page 51 . The author claims that Fuchs came to the
United States in 1946 and asked fellow scientists about the
duties of a communist scientist which was reported to the
FBI. Then the FBI watched Fuchs:and reported to MI-5 that
Fuchs had been seen meeting Soviet agents.

This is a complete f ication. We identified
(5) Fuchs from Bureau Source 8) informatio old the British, who
interroga Fuchs and hé~c nfessed-} J

 

page 52 The author claims the FBI followed the Cohens

after the arrest of the Rosenbergs. The author claims the i

FBI found out that the Cohens were friends of the Rosenbergs. ‘
This is false. .

page 53 The author states Lona Cohen was co-director |
of "Save the Rosenbergs" campaign.

This is false.
pages 54-55 The aithor tells of Lonsdale's training in
Winnitsa which is allegedly the town in Russia which is set f
up like an American town. :

_ We have received reports of the existence of this
town, however, it has never been proven. . ;

_ page 55 The claim is made that an FBI source in the
United States stated Lonsdale was trained in this town.

This is a lie.

page 61 Contains a fanciful description of Lonsdale
meeting the Cohens in Tokyo in 1954 on their way to Canada.

This has no basis in fact.
