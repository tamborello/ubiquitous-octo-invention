effective action in Cuba. According. eofeerépivo CUBELA C1)
desires. some sort of. compact ‘equipment with which he can
possibly eliminate TRO; “however , CIA keeps offering
him only large, bulky; unserviéeable material.

£. a ‘According to [EPEDINO,\ there is now under discussion

i. some plan to kill FIDEL CASTRO, in which CUBELA will figure.
CIA allegedly was formerly in favor of such a plan; however,
inasmuch as Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY would have no
‘part of it, it was shelved. Now the plan has allegedly been
brought up again for consideration. President JOHNSON
allegedly is aware of it, and has not ruled against it.
If set in motion, it will be scheduled to occur sometime
before the elections in November.

[TEPEDING|told the informant he has not been able u)
to learn much more concerning this plan, other than that ;

CUBELA is supposed to participate, that it is to be
accomplished by men in Cuba, and possibly someone from
Europe, :

 

 

. The informant advised (cerEDiNo| did not spectftcattiy)
indicate how he had acquired this information; however, the

informant presumed from his manner of speaking that he had
obtained it from CUBELA.

i The above is for the information of the Bureau,

and is not being submitted in form suitable for dissemination\l)
since. both[{TEPEDING]and CUBELA are apparently of operational
interest to CIA. Dissemination would also lead to the
disclosure of MM 761-S. Although questioned closely,

MM 761-S was not able to furnish any further details.
