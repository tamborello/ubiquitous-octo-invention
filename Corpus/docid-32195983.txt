Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Senator Hart contacted the Attorney General personally
and asked the Attorney General to furnish the identity of a Bureau
informant. The Attorney General instructed Steven E. Blackhurst,
Assistant Special Counsel on Intelligence Coordination in the °

[becartaens of Justice, to make some accommodation with regards to
Senator Hart's request.

With the approval of Deputy. Associate Director James B. -
Adams, SA Paul V. Daly of this Division and Mr. Blackhurst met with
Committee staff members Michael Epstein, James Johnson and Paul
Wallach on 5/21/76. At this time it was explained to the staffers
that the Bureau was. unalterably opposed to the disclosure of the
identity of a Bureau informant. Various alternatives were dis-
cussed with the Committee including a characterization of the
informant. Arrangements were made to meet again on 5/24/76 con-
cerning the same matter.

On 5/24/76, a meeting was held with the same individuals
present. At this time, Johnson, acting on behalf of Senator Hart,
Jno longer pressed for the identity of the informant but stated for
their purposes it would be sufficient if they had a characterization
of the informant and a description of the types of information he
furnished, including information concerning organizations.

~ Special Agent Sam Miller of the Intelligence Division
advised that the informant who is MM761-S (former) has furnished
information on pro and anti-Castro activities by Cuban exiles and
was a member of the Cuban exile community. He stated that dis-
closure of this information would not’ compromise the identity of
the informant. He indicated he had talked to SA Vinicio Nasca of
the Intelligence Division who agreed with this. It should be
noted that should the Committee request the aforementioned in-
formation it would be within their authority as contained in the
agreement between Chairman Frank Church of the SSC and the
Attorney General. It is felt that we should furnish them this
information.
