should be placed on whether or not the underworld is investing money in

NOTE ;:

 

Allegations previously received but not substantiated that
Marcello possibly involved in International Time, Inc. -{ITI), a firm
incorporated in the State of New York. PCI Hansen is president of this
organization. ITI reportedly involved inititernational oil scheme to |
purchase Venezuela oil at reduced price and sell same to European ;
countries. - Oil to be shipped directly from Venezuela to Europe and '
ITI only handling finances and deals regarding legal transactions. So
PCI Hansen advises the scheme being formulated through the intervention

of Delesseps Morrison who was recently appointed by President Kennedy as
‘Ambassador to.the Organization of American States. By virtue of Morrison's
appointment and through his contacts in Venezuela, he allegedly is to have
a.law passed by the Venezuelan Government enabling this oil to be Sold

for $161 a barrel, whereas the current posted price is $2.50. The oil is

to be purchased by ITI and resold at approximately $1. 66 a barrel.
