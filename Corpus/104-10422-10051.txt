Sylvia DURAN - secretary in Cuban Embassy in Mexico. She was one
Oswald contacted tc apply for Cuban visa. Her name
came to our attention & the Mex. Gov's via the teltap.
All info about DURAN which was published in the Warren
Report was provided the Commission by the Mex. Gov. via
State Dept. CIA was never tied in publicly to DURAN

LA Division wishes to withhold mention of DURAN because
the ultimate source in identifying her contact with Oswald —
was the teltap.

II. Gilberto ALVARADO Uguarte - Nicaraguan who a walked inte the American
Am Embassy in Mexico after the assassination ‘claiming he had knowledge
of the matter. Claimed Oswald had received $ from a Cuban at the
Cuban Embassy. Turned out thru tracing that ALVARADO was an agent
for the Nicaraguan Intel Service. However, Alvarado's story was
only his invention and had nothing to do with Nic. Intel. Alvarado's
gak story does appear in the Warren Report but his identity is
wilthheld,. . . :

Leave in info re ALVARADO but delete his identity including
citizenship @ also delete identity of Nicaraguan service.

taken in Mexico in front of Sov Embassy, but do not want
