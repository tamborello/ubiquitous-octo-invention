“RECEIVED FROM.
@ 12 April 1974

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

 

SUBJECT :

#343 589

A memorandum dated 12 March 1970 seems to pinpoint

the time period during which M@ebYifirst made available to this
office a copy of Howard HUNT's manuscript, "Give Us This Day,"
as being early March 1970. The memorandum from
to C/SRS advised that (ime) had telephoned from

home that afternoon and had asked if we had received the copy **-
: of/"Hunt Ms." told Riasy Ithat it had come in‘and
I. en) asked whether he should vem to determine any more.

@ details concerning the origin of it. suggested that

. Gaeas do nothing until we advised him, (Although
referred to it as the "Hunt Ms,’ in his memorandum, it would :
seem that QWAIEEY: was not aware of the true authorship, at this
point). Que y, expressed concern for his friend in the publish-
ing house, who had ''filched" the Ms., as he allegedly had
informed BYE! to be very careful with it.[ —s—s*éAaVsed
that he informed Eismeny. that in all probability no decision would
be made on this for another three or four weeks.

Information from gimmie

: Re: LEB HARVEY OSWALD, (RBSSE89)] met Oswald last winter

in Greenwich Village, New York City at the "Fat Black
Pussy Cat" (which was much less expensive than it is
now, with fewer tourists). @Si6GaN saw him there several
times with extreme leftist, peacenik types, He seemed

to be a "loner", but did associate with a couple in
their early thirties, (See below.) .

The last time that @ASe8CaL! saw Oswald he got into a
conversation with hin, and it almost ended in a fight.
ABSSCSLi lost his temper and wanted to hit Oswald be-
cause of his strong communist position. He was very
eanti-U.S.A., pro-Castro and pro-Chinese Heds (but not
pro-Soviet. Union).

What interested fAbascAl: most was that Oswald hed no job
but still had sufficient money, oO

The couple Oswald associated with were quiet, but during
political discussions the man would feed Oswald key words
or bits of information when he was backed into a corner,

(Note. I urged MBEStal! to go to the FBI with the inf : a

~amm offered to arr a& meeting. He promised to tell: ther “a
the story, and made contact through an agent (O'Brien) whom -
he kmew because of past’ activities.)

  

  

 

Sources from inside Cuba have rkported that HERBERT MATTHEWS
and two Russians met with Fidel Castro several months ago

and tried to convince him to step down in favor of a coalition
gov't, that Khrushchev and Kennedy nad agreed on. Castro
refused to consider it. (Some Cubans think that Gastro is
behind the Kennedy assassination ~ that he was acting to
block this deal which was to take effect before the 196k.
election. ) :

In early Dec. (see memo on my telephoned report for exact
date )@OS5ceT} revorted that CARLOS FRANKE of the Castro
publication "Revolution" was at Idlewild Aircort. He had
arrived on flight 509 of BOAC from Paris & London, Franke
had just finished a trip behind the Iron Curtain,

Regarding @Uescal, his Office of Security

veracity: ~

Office of Security/Security Research
Staff memorandum dated 15 August 1966:
n@Bascal has for several years furnished
information to SRS source which has been

@ - usually fictitious."

Office of Security/Security Research

"(Apaseal) has furnished source with
intelligence information which appears
to be complete fabrication.”

PBI letterhead memorandum dated

30 September 1963 captioned "Movimiento
Democrata Cristiano (MDC)" contains the
following statements about ‘Apaseal! by
FBI sources: “One would only have to
know Enrique-Abascal>to know that this
(a Life magazine articles) was nothing

- but”a publicity stunt on his part and
that he has no importance whatsoever in
the anti-Castro Movement." ‘Sometimes

know whether or not he should pity him
or try to afford him some kind of medical
