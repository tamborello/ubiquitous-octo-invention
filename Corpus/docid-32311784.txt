The case against LANE was hy Us. approximately.
December, 1961 on a complaint from Alexander's Department
Store, Queens ,N¥.., concerning a bad check received from
a customer, one PHYLLIS. DENISE OLDEN in the’ amount of
approximately $100. GOLDEN was Subsequently contacted
‘by Mr. ANDERSON and promised to make the check good. At
that time she stated"her boyfriend" would have to make the
check good since she had “enough on him" to keep her the
vest of her life. When GOLDEN failed-to pay the money to
5 Alexander's, ANDERSON told her that she could possibly be
prosecuted. GOLDEN then stated she was mad at her boyfriend
for his failure to give her money and wanted to furnish
the District Attorney's Office with all details concerning
this person she identified as the attorney, MARK LANE.
In this connection, GOLDEN stated she had worked for LANE
as his secretary for six months with no pay. She further
stated she had another woman who would give inf mation con-

cerning LANE. 'o, fo /. 4 Spt C3! a

Xs Accordingly, "GOLDEN and one ELIZABETH TEE
Ss

  

STEPHENSON appeared at the Queens County District Attorney' s

ffice and each furnished signed statements concerning
Sadistic and masochistic acts performed by them on the
person of MARK LANE.’ ‘She further furnished an obscene
photograph of LANE , which she said had been taken by her
using a Polaroid Land camera.” (Details of these alleged
acts have been previously furnished the Bureau as attach-
ments to the report of SA JOHN E. WARREN, entitled "SARAH
SCHOENKOFF; PEACE CORPS + APPLICANT" (New York file 161+
1207).

 

Mr. PATTON decided to present the entire matter
to the Queens County Grand Jury, but realized at the time
that the charges against LANE were vague in that masochism
is not covered as a crime under present statuites. He
further stated that neither girl would admit that sodomy
took place during the acts referred to.

The Grand Jury failed to return a true bill and
the matter was closed.

Mr. PATTON stated that he believes PHYLLES GOLDEN
apparently related her actions to MARK LANE, at which time
LANE came to the District Attorney's Office and denied
all charges and also denied he was the person in the photo-
graph. Mr. PATTON said that prior to the Grand Jury hearing,
pressure to drop the charges against LANE was brought by
LL LAN who was then New York City Commissioner
in) charge of Investigations. (He has since been appointed
a Wew York City Judge). KAPLAN accused PATTON's office of
impropér behavior in the matter, a charge which PATTON
ignored. On 2/5/82, PHYLLIS GOLDEN submitted an affidavit
recanting her previous statement and testimony before the
Grand Jury. In this affidavit, GOLDEN stated she had
lied and the original information furnished by her to the
Queens County District Attorney's Office was false. This
statement had been sworn to before STANLEY GELLER, Notary”
Public, State of New York, and was witnessed by NORMAN
DORSEN, believed by Mr. PATTON to be a member of the
faculty at the NYO Law School.

Mr. PATTON stated serious consideration was given
to charging GOLDEN with perjury in view of her testimony before
the Grand Jury, but it was decided the case was weak and no
further action was taken.

 

The other person involved, ELIZABETH STEPHENSON,
following the submission of her statement, refused all further
cooperation on any basis with the District Attorney's
Office.

The above is placed in the administrative section
of this report since it contains a great deal of conjecture
and opinion on the part of PATTON and ANDERSON.
