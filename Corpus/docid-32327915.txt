such a car by the-end of the year. GUIGA also indicated
that the best time to buy one of these stolen cars

was at the time of the big rush for license plates

(at the end or the beginning of a calendar year) since
the Motor Vehicle Bureau would not check numbers during
such rush periods.

NY T-1, on September 10, 1962, defined a "button
man" as the initial step of membership for a recognized
and accepted member of the Italian criminal organization
known as "La Cosa Nostra".

SALVATORE GRANELLO, also known as Solly Burns,
FBI number 2120006, was born on June 15, 1923, at New
york City, and possesses an arrest record dating from
1940.

NY T-3; in January, 1963, described SALVATORE
GRANELLO as a member of the VITO GENOVESE "family" within
"La Cosa Nostra".

VITO ANTHONY GENOVESE, FBI number 861367, born
November 21, 1897, Risigliano, Italy, arrived in the United
States on May 23, 1913, and was naturalized on November 25,
1936, in the Southern District of New York.

GENOVESE, an attendee at the Apalachin, New York
meeting on November 14, 1957, has been described by NY T-1
as a member of "La Cosa Nostra" and the head of the
GENOVESE "family". He is presently serving a fifteen
year prison sentence at the United States Penitentiary,
Leavenworth, Kansas, as a result of conviction on
narcotics conspiracy charges.

2. Hijacking

NY T-4, on December 10,1955, revealed that he
and HANK PERRONE had visited the Rex Bar and Grill, Grand
Street, Manhattan, where he was introduced to LOUIS GUIGA
and another individual described as GUIGA's partner.
During this meeting, LOUIS GUIGA discussed the possibility
of "taking" a large load of liquor from a Queens, New York
express company truck which was known to pick up shipments
of liquor from the piers on a regular basis. In discussing
this matter, GUIGA indicated that he had two good "drops",
one in Brooklyn, the other in Harlem, and that he had a
buyer who would take such a load immediately. It was

informant's understanding that GUIGA and his cohorts
had to forego effecting this plan because of their
inability to elicit the cooperation of the driver of
the truck involved,

3. Gambling

A review of the records of the NYCPD in 1954,
Py SA JOHN HENRY DOYLE, determined that LOUIS. GUIGA,
245 Mulberry Street, Manhattan, NYCPD number B-268762,
was listed as a gambler under consideration by the NYCPD
| as a prime bookmaking suspect.

E. HANGOUTS AND PLACES FREQUENTED

NY T-2, on June 20, 1957, advised that he had \
contacted LOUIE GUIGA in the Elizabeth Bar and Grill, |
Elizabeth Street near Kenmare, New York City, where |
GUIGA often hangs out, |

|
\
!
|

NY T-4, on December 10, 1955, advised that he
had met with HANK PERRONE at the Rex Bar and Grill,
Grand Street, Manhattan, where PERRONE introduced informant
to LOUIS GUIGA.

It is to be noted that, during the course of '
another investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of H
Investigation, information was obtained prior to December 10,
1955, which indicated that the above-described Rex Bar and
Grill was owned by an uncle of LOUIS GUIGA, name and address
not indicated. ‘

F. MISCELLANEOUS 1

Mrs. THERESA BORELL, License Records Section, |
New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, Albany, New York, !
advised IC PHILIP M, DILLON on May 27, 1963, that she !
could locate no record concerning LOUIS CHARLES GUIGA, 228 '
Mott Street, New York City.

The files of the Credit Bureau of Greater New York,
furnished by Miss PAULINE DE FIORE to IC MULLINS on May 21,
1963, noted that LOUIS GUIGA, 228 Mott Street, New York
City, was sued by Dr. JOHN B. CASALE, 530 Park Avenue,
New York City, for $100.00 on September 29, 1961. The ; :
attorney was noted as Hoyt and Hoyt, 99 Wall Street, New
York City.

ADMINISTRATIVE (CONT'D)

It is to be further noted that, based upon
information supplied by NY 169-C to the effect that
LOUIS GUIGA was a downtown, East Side Manhattan "button
man", it was initially considered that GUIGA might be
a member of the JOSEPH BONANNO "family" within "La Cosa
Nostra” since it was initially believed that BONANNO's
territorial allocation within the organization included
the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

Subsequent investigation, however, has determined
that territorial rights relative to the Lower East Side
of Manhattan are not assigned exclusively to one particu-
lar "family". ;

In view of this development and that fact that
NY 169-C has expressed the belief that GUIGA operates
with and under SOLLY BURNS (SALVATORE GRANELLO), who
has been identified as a member of the VITO GENOVESE
| "family", LOUIS CHARLES GUIGA is now being considered
a member of the VITO GENOVESE "family".

Information set forth in instant report under
the caption "E, HANGOUTS AND PLACES FREQUENTED" indicating
| the Rex Bar and Grill, Grand Street, Manhattan, was owned
| by an uncle of LOUIS GUIGA, is located in case captioned ~
| “NATHAN KLEMAS, was., ET AL; TFIS", NY 15-10144-138,
| pages 64-65.
