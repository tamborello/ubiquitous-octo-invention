ARNOLD RAYBER, Gun Dealer, 202 Flatbush Ave.,
Brooklyn, NY, an A & TT informant, contacted Special
Investigator KALES on 9/26/58, and advised that a
representative of Cuban revolutionary leadey JOSE ALEMAN,
requested RAYBER to meet with member of Mafia named JOSEPH
MEROLA. Shortly thereafter, RAYBER met with MEROLA and two
Cubans in an apartment in vicinity of 138 St. and Riverside
Dr., NYC, MEROLA stated he was associated with JOSE ALEMAN,
and that he was interested in purchase of large quantity of ,
firearms, including machine guns. MEROLA advised RAYBER
that he has been respénsible for supplying over a million
dollars in arms to revolutionists, and that he and his
associates anticipated fat gambling concessions in Cuba from
new government. MEROLA said that two men in Miami, who
were peddling B.A.R.'s are BOB GREENE, FR 3-7415; and JIM
RASKIN HT 4-8873. MEROLA mentioned to RAYBER that he was one
of financiers of the vessel HARPOON, which had been seized
in Miami with arms and men aboard, and was also one of the
men responsible for the LILLY BELLE, a vessel allegedly —™
engaged in illicit arms transfers between Miami and Cuba.

A & TT temporarily loaned to RAYBER a number of _
seized weapons, so that he could have a representative stock
to display to MEROLA,

On 10/6/58, RAYBER advised KALES that MEROLA had

connection with the procurement of arms. MEROLA wanted
RAYBER to accumulate a large pile of American "stuff" for
him, and would temporarily postpone any purchase of arms,
since Miami was then filled with FBI Agents looking for
stolen arms.

On 8/10/59, RAYBER was interviewed by Agents of
NYO. He confirmed information furnished by A & TT, and
identified photograph of MEROLA. RAYBER could not identify
photograph of SAM MANNARINO. RAYBER stated that about one
month after MEROLA contacted him he was contacted by CHARLES
COLLE, Gun Dealer, MILLVILLE ORDINANCE CO., Union, N.J., who
said he knew where a lot of M-1 rifles could be bought.
COLLE told RAYBER that it was hot stuff, part of the loot
lifted from the armory in Ohio, and that the one who had the
guns wanted to get rid of them. COLLE said that it would be
necessary to meet the seller in Washington, D.C., and from
there go to where the guns were stored, RAYBER had no
information as to where the guns in question were stored.
RAYBER said he was sure he had furnished this information to
A & TT, but nothing further materialized.

Regarding the vessel, HARPOON, RAYBER said that he
learned from a source in Miami, whose identity he refused to
disclose, that information leaked from Customs Service in
Miami that the HARPOON and ILLY BELLE were scheduled to be
seized whenever they sailed for Cuba. Following instructions
received from his Miami source, this information was made
available to the July 26 Movement, who made it available to
MEROLA. MEROLA agreed to pay $3,000.00 for it. The money
was never paid. RAYBER stated that as a result of this leak,
he would not trust the Customs Service in Miami.

Newark 1s requested to interview COLLE concerning
any information of instant case, and in such a manner as to
fully protect the identity of RAYBER, a current informant of
A & TT, NYC, and one who has requested his identity be
concealed. ;
