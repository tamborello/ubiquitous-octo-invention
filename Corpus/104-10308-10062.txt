11. The boat then travelled east for approximately two to three
miles down the coast from Guanabo, and they attempted to land on the
beach again, Due to large rocks and heavy surf they decided -not to
attempt a landing and instead anchored the boat beyond the surf line
(about 30 yards out) and both RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ swam into the beach,

RODRIGUEZ went inla hd: bus to Guanabo, and they went back
to the safehouse of 6 At the Bafehouse he found the :
pickup team of =~ and some 28 people whom they had

acquired as pass@€ngers., These passengers were all relatives of BLANCO
and AMBIG-4, and BLANCO and AMBIG-4 told RODRIGUEZ they had been unable
to locate the homes of Jesus—GOMEZCalzadilla and AMLEO-3 and therefore
had not been able to contact these families. They then returned the
bona fides photos and messages to RODRIGUEZ to take back to AMLEO~3
and GOMEZ. (AMLEO-3 commented bitterly on this point stating that
AMBIG-4 and BLANCO probably went to their own homes first,.and after
seeing the number of their relatives who wanted to come, ni even
tried_to_find his home nor that of GOMEZ. ) RODRIGUEZ, AMBIG-4, and
BLANCO agreed upon another exfiltration point to the east of Guanabo,
and arranged recognition signals. RODRIGUEZ then returned to the boat,
leaving AMBIG-4 and BLANCO to convoy the passengers in three cars to
the exfiltration point. - : a
pie

12, RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ arrived at the exfiltration point about
20 minutes after the appointedtour of 2300, and halted the boat about
100 meters offshore, They saw a light on top of the reef at which
point RODRIGUEZ told LOPEZ that the light was the proper signal,
(When asked about the recognition signals, LOPEZ stated that he did not
know what the exact signals were, but that they involved 2 or 3 lights
and an exchange of names, He maintains that RODRIGUEZ handled all
these details), They brought the boat right up to the reef at which
point they were fired upon from the top of the cliffs from the directic
of the highway. (AMLABEL~1 asked LOPEZ how they had planned to get
women and children down these steep cliffs. LOPEZ replied thatthe
difficulties-involved.had..not, occurred to them, By the same token, ~
they had no extra food on board the boat to feed the families. )

13. RODRIGUEZ shouted to LOPEZ to jump overboard to use the
boat as protection against the rifle fire. LOPEZ states that RODRIGUE:
was hit as he jumped overboard. RODRIGUEZ could not swim because of
his shoulder wound, On RODRIGUEZ' command, LOPEZ (who by this time
had RODRIGUEZ around his neck) started to swim toward shore. LOPEZ
decided this avenue of escape was foolish, and turned back toward the
boat, LOPEZ pulled RODRIGUEZ aboard. He then claims that the rifle

 

14. LOPEZ started the motor and was proceeding north when he
saw the signal lights of 6 or 7 small boats ringed in a semi-circle
in front of his boat, LOPEZ apprised RODRIGUEZ (laid out flat on the
deck) of this new development, Even though bleeding and barely con-
scious RODRIGUEZ asked LOPEZ if he could see the lights of Matanzas
City. LOPEZ said he could, RODRIGUEZ advised him to head toward
Matanzas hugging the coastline. The patrol craft (or fishing boats)
had since extinguished their lights, LOPEZ followed his advice and
several hours later arrived off Matanzas City having eluded the patrol
craft. RODRIGUEZ then told LOPEZ to turn the boat to the left until
the compass showed "N", straighten out and follow that course to Key
West. Three or four of the gas tanks had been pierced by the barrage,
and there was barely enough gas left to make it to Key West. Their
last remaining water tank was also shot up. They arrived at approxi-
mately 1730 hours at Sunset Harbor Marina, Stock Island, Key West,
Fla, on 12 May 1964,

15, Upon arrival in Key West, Fla, RODRIGUEZ was hospitalized
and X-Ray pictures disclosed that the bullet had entered above his
right shouder blade and came out on his right side and penetrated thro
his arm, He had four cracked ribs, and it appeared that his right
lung was not punctured, but there was some blood between his lung and
the pleura @nd the Subject was operated on successfully the morning

AFTER ACTION REPORTS

16, After the abortive exfiltration attempt hy the M/V ADA, .
various relatives of people involved began to receive telephone calls”
and telegrams from Cuba reporting on the arrest or safety of various
individwis, The following excerpts were taken from various BARR cabl
and debriefings of Romelio LOPEZ Sosa and AMLEO-3:

A. On 13 May 1964, AMSWIRL-1 visited Tomas RODRIGUEZ
Fuentes, of 1021 Margaret Street, Key West, former Captain with the
National Police in Havana who had received a telegram from his daughte)
Elsa OLIVERA, at 0920 hours 13 May 1964, (She was supposed to have co
out with BLANCO and AMBIG-4 in the exfiltration). The telegram stated
(English translation) "Congratulations, we are well, love to all,
embrace, Your daughter,", and supposedly indicated the daughter was
safe, .

B. On 14 May 1964, AMSWIRL-1 was told by Daniel RODRIGUE
Santos that Valentin BLANCO, relative of Armando BLANCO Lorenzo, had

‘received three telegrams from Cuba: the first on 10 May stated

"Armando arrived all is well" ; the second on 11 May stated, "Armando
departed, all is well"; and the third on 13 May stated, "Yesterday's
cable no good, Armando admitted or hospitalized", meaning Armando

BLANCO had been picked up by Cuban authorities.

C. On 14 May 1964, AMLEO-3 called the C/O and informed
him that the 14 year old son of Mario REMIS (see para 3 A above) had
called his father in Miami at 1130 hours that same date, and told him
he had been arrested along with his mother and some other people while
trying_to leave Ciba, and that the police had let the children free,
but continued” t6 hold the adults under arrest. Reportedly only
one car had. been picked up near the exfiltration point, and the people
in the other two cars had supposedly escaped arrest for the time being
As of 23.May 1964, no other information has been been reported to_KUBARK.
on the fate of ‘BLANCO, AUBIG=4, Ox_thenassehgers_who were at the
exfiltration n_point,

 

GENERAL COMMENTS ON TRIP OF ‘THE M/V ‘ADA

17. As noted in paragraph 8 of reference J, various operational
inconsistencies still exist _in the e account submitted above re the
exfiitration trip of the M/V ADA to Cuba, WAVE is of the opinion
that~some-ofthese—inconsistenciéSs ¢an be attributed to genuine con-
fusion of facts by the principal source of information, Rogelio LOPEZ
Sosa, (who did not see the infiltration team of BLANCO and AMBIG-4
again after their infiltration inland), and the withholding of facts
by_AMLEO-3 who considers _this activity was_his_own_personal bisiness—
and_had hothing to do with KUBARK. Daniel RODRIGUEZ Santos is ,
probably more Knowledgeable of exactly what occurred during the infil-
tration, but due to his illness AMSWIRL-1 was not able to interrogate
him in Key West, and reportedly RODRIGUEZ is still very ill and
KUBARK does not consider it worthwhile to attempt an interrogation
of him at this time. It is also believed that RODRIGUEZ will withholc
information he considers privileged, and it has been noted that
AMLEO-3's principal organizer of the expedition, Ma EMIS, has
peen visiting RODRIGUEZ daily in Mount Sinai hospital in Miami, Fla.
Since the two infiltrees, BLANCO and AMBIG-4, are either under arrest
or in hiding it is doubtful that their inside activities relative to
AMLEO-3's family etc., will ever be completely clarified. '

18. As noted in paragraph 9 of reference J, AMLEO-3 continues
to look for methods whereby he may exfiltrate his family from Cuba,
and has reached the point where he is no longer rational in his
reasoning re the risk factors to himself or his family, AMLEO-3 is

exfiltration attempts to rescue his family, he has decided that he
would prefer to terminate his relationship with KUBARK so that he can
earry out”™such exfiltration attempts on his own in a completely
independent manner,

 
 

   
  

2. Since November 1963, JMWAVE has noted in all AMLEO progress
reports that Mrs. AMLEO-3 was dabbling in exfiltration attempts in-
side Cuba, and has also successfully managed to pry funds out of
AMLEO-3 in attempts to buy her way into such efforts. As a result
AMLEO-3 has porrowed money from susan aba 1 and family relatives in the \
U.S. attemPting to support his wife in these attempts, and is nowin £&
debt_to these individuals to. the tune o 7900.00, On 5 May 1964,

to nave confirmation of the attempt by 1900 hours on 10 May 1964,
Nothing was heard from AMLEO-3 the night of 10 May 1964, but the fol-
lowing morning, at 0840 hours 11 May 1964, AMLEO-3 contacted the C/O
and-gave him the following information:

"The exfiltration of my family will begin on the night
of 11 May 1964, and the group will consist of some 11
adults and children. They plan to depart from Playa
de Guanabo, between Havana and Matanzas, during the
night of 11 May 1964 and expect to arrive in Key West,
Florida sometime on 12 May 1964,"

 
 
    
 
   

follow, etc. It was not until 13 May 1964, that AMLEO-3 mentioned

to Bruce P, VEDDER and Leon C, FLUTEO, during a routine operational
meeting, thajhe-had_sponsored and masterminded the_ahkorted exfiltratiio
operation, _andthat_the-operation_had_bean mounted from the U,S. and

not ‘from_inaide. the_island, as he had previously claimed to the C/O.

3. On 14 May 1964, the C/O contacted AMLEO-3 and requested an
explanation of his sponsorship of the exfiltration operation, AMLEO-3
claimed he np longer felt bound to confide these activities on his
part_to KUBARK,—Since KUBARK had refusad—to-centinue—its effort to_
rescue his wife and family from Cuba, and furthermore that he would
continue such unilateral exfiitration efforts with or without KUBARK
help until he either rescued his family from Cuba, or died in his
attempts to do so. AMLEO-3 claims he orgarized the trip of the M/V
ADA by passing himself off as a PBPRIMER, and utilized the following
individuals in the operation,

‘ A. Wario REMIS.,. probably identical with Mario REMIS-
CAMEJO, A-12 834 780; PDOB; Havana, Cuba on 6/20/23; who formerly
resided at Calle 130A, #36506, Wajay, Marianao, Havana, Cuba; came
to the U.S. from Cuba in August 1962 departing from Guanabo by small
boat with five other Cuban refugees, AMLEO-3 claims he used this
individual as.his- principal organizer in_t xpedition, and REMIS
had agreed to go into Cuba a@ting aS a guide and leader of the group.
REMIS had previously resided in an area close to AMLEO-3's home in
Wajay, Cuba and had agreed to go tq A-3's home and bring his family
gut. . REMIS-did recruit and organize the boat crev., but at the last
minute supposedly was unable to to make the trip because -ofother———
committnents and instead turned hi _his_responsibilities over to the next

individual Daniel (RODRIGUEZ) _Santos,.

B. Daniel (RODRIGUEZ) Santos is the owner of the M/V .
ADA, and brought the boat out from Cuba in his escape in November 1963.
Since REMIS could not make the trip, he and A-3 reportedly briefed
RODRIGUEZ on the location of A-3's home in Wajay, and supplied him :
with a recent photograph of Mrs, AMLEO-3 and her children, and AMLEO-3:
wrote a bona fides message in his own handwriting on the back of the
photograph ‘and also listed his home address without revealing (he says.

GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION

1. During the past year and a half AMLEO-3 has been placated,
and kept under control, by the continuous effort of KUBARK to assist
him in obtaining aSyilim for his wife and family in a third country
diplomatic installation in Cuba, Since the failure of the last
asylum attempt for Mrs. AMLEO-3 in March 1964, as reported in refer-
ence I, and the refusal of Mrs. AMLEO-3 to even consider taking asylum
without advance guarantees of a salvo conducto; AMLEO-3 lost what
little optimism he had remaining for a safe method of bringing his
wife and children out of Cuba, After the failure of the asylum
attempt in March 1964, Mrs. AMLEO-3 again. renewed.her attack upon
AMLEO-3 by phone. and letter, urging him to rescue her by any means
at his disposal, and by her efforts she has successfully convinced him
that his family will escape only if she can arrange an exfiltration
mounted from inside the island, or if AMLEO-3 sends someone to get. her
or comes himself to exfiltrate her and their children. Up until
recently the C/O has been able to persuade AMLEO-3 that undertakings
of this nature were foolhardy unless carried out by trained maritime
assets skilled in clandestine infiltration and exfiltration, and
equipped with the proper vessels and support to carry out the mission
successfully. Now that the KUBARK asylum efforts have been discon-

to lead the infiltration mission, and personally contact AMLEO-3's
family and the family of Jesus. GOMEZ Calzadilla in Guines, Cuba and
take them to the exfiltration point. RODRIGUEZ also planned to bring
out his fiancee, and the other boat crew members had agreed to bring
out one or two relatives each, the total number of passengers was not
supposed to exceed 15 persons.

; Cc. Armando BLANCO Lorenzo, Romelio LOPEZ Sosa, and
AMBIG—4 ywere_recrujted by RODRIGUEZ for the mission, and supposedly
AMLEO-3 did not have contact with them prior to the mission, nor were
they witting that he was one of the sponsors of the mission. AMBIG~4
was to bring out his father, mother, sister, younger brother, and his
own and LOPEZ's fiancees; BLANCO his wife and daughter; RODRIGUEZ,
his fiancee, and the wives and children of AMLEO-3 and Jesus GOMEZ
Calzadilla. AMLEO~3 has never been informed by his C/O that AMBIG-4
was a KUBARK asset, and AMLEO-3 has never indicated in any way that he
knew AMBIG-4 was a KUBARK asset, Since the boat in question, the M/V
ADA, was not equipped with a radio set, AMBIG~4 was obviously not
desired for use as a radio operator by the group.

4, AMLEO-3 informed the C/O that he had previously warned his
wife that something waS to happen the weekend of I0-May 1964, and “that |
someone wou e comin @ See her with bona fides from him, ‘ffs.
AMLEG-3 also was instructed to supply this contact man with all the
pesos she had at her disposal, since the infiltrees reportedly were
able to take in only $170.00 worth of pesos with them. Sjnce_the
abort_of the mission, Mrs. AMLEO-3 has talked to A-3 by phone at least
three times, and she claims no one ever contacted her; that no one
has bothéred her since the failure of the mission; and that she is

5. During this period the gasoline, food, and other necessities
were purchased along with four sets of green fatigues which the group
bought in a local Army/Navy store. They were also equipped with two
Colt .45 Cal pistols, one P-38 pistol, one Browning automatic .38 Cal
pistol, and 250 rounds of ammunition for the four weapons, These
weapons were taken on the mission for self defense purposes only.

The boat, the M/V ADA, was located at Sunset Harbor Marina, Stock

6. On 9 May 1964, at approximately 1800 hours, the M/V ADA
departed from Sunset Harbor Marina, Stock Island, Key West, Fla for
Cuba. The crew was made up of Daniel RODRIGUEZ Santos, Rogelio LOPEZ
Sosa, Armando BLANCO Lorenzo, and AMBI8-4, The M/V ADA was enroute
fo Cuba during the remainder of 9 May 1964, and nothing unusual
.reportedly occurred during the voyage.

7, The infiltration crew arrived in Cuba at a point approxi-
mately 4 mile east of PJlayaGuanabo on 10 May 1964 at 1625 hours,
There was no beach per se at this spot but reefs from 6 to 9 feet high
They had difficulty mooring the boat because the water was turbulent
at the base of the reefs. In broad daylight, all four went ashore and
walked across the highway 'Via Blanca', There were several empty
trenches between the highway and the coast line, but the group could
detect no vigilance in the area, ° LOPEZ was left hidden in the bushes
near the highway, while the other three proceeded into Guanabo to

8, LOPEZ. began to count cars to while away the time, During
the period 1630-1900 hours LOPEZ counted 38 6X6 type trucks with
approximately 50 militia each, all travelling in the direction of
Matanzas, One other truck, containing about 15 negroes and 6 whites,
who LOPEZ states were not Cubans, was observed going in the same
easterly direction, LOPEZ states that the traffic was unusually heavy
in both directions, RODRIGUEZ returned about 1900 and he and LOPEZ
went back to the boat. RODRIGUEZ told LOPEZ that he had been able to
get transportation for both AMBIG-4 and BLANCO; AMBIG-4 to Quivican and
BLANCO to Artemisa where their respective families are lacated.
RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ took the boat out about a mile, shut off the
engine and went to sleep. (The above information in para 8 is the
version AMLABEL-1 obtained from LOPEZ, )

9. n_the AMLEO-3 version of this period, again acquired from
LOPEZ, AMLEO=3 reported the following activity: Upon his return to
the boat about 1900 hours, RODRIGUEZ saw LOPEZ and told him to wait
and then RODRIGUEZ returned to Guanabo to see his fiance and reportedly
to establish contact with friends of A-3 in the GOC. A=3 would not
say how these contacts were carried out, but due to the time factor
it -is assumed they could only have been done by phone. A-3 claims

relative to these supposed inside contacts of his. AMLEO-3 states
that RODRIGUEZ returned to the boat about 2330 hours on 10 May 1964,
and then he and LOPEZ boarded the boat and went out to sea for the
night. A-3 also stated that LOPEZ told him that at least eight local
fisherman dropped by to look at the boat while it remained at the reef,
and nothing was done to insure the cooperation of the fishermen nor
did LOPEZ attempt to hold them at the spot to prevent their informing
on th® infiltration to local security authorities.

10. After putting out to sea, RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ slept during
the night and awoke the next morning, 11 May, at about 1130 hours to
find themselves directly across from the city of Matanzas. They
returned to the Guanabo area about 2030 hours, (LOPEZ said the boat
would only do about 4 to 6 knots). They took the boat back close to
the original landing piacé, waited to see some light signals indi-
