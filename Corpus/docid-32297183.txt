: "Set. R. SHULTZ, Bertie Township Police, ‘who is
a close friend of the MAHONEYS, advised that Charlotte
MOYER.is a divorcee from Philadelphia who visited Mildred,
: ' MAHONEY at Ridgeway during July, 1962, having met the MAHONEYS.
‘ at a race track in Florida. According.to SHULTZ, Mildred
; MAHONEY will be leaving for Florida within the next. week and
will not be returning to Canada until the summer of 1963. It
is felt that Mildred MAHONEY ° ‘would supply any information
: desired to your Bureau,. however she. was not interviewed due
| to the nature Of. this enquiry."

It. is ‘noted that WILLIAM MAHONEY - is referred to as a
_gtate Senate Majority Leader of the State.of New York. It is
“further noted, that: WALTER J. MAHONEY is the State ‘Senate
Majority. Leader of the, State of New York.: Buffalo is requestcd
ito detérmine whether MILDRED MAHONEY ‘is the wife of WALTER J.
: MAHONEY or WILLIAM MAHONEY. -

For the ‘information, of all offices, it is pointed out
, that "a report was published recently in which WALTER J,
: MAHONEY, Majority Leader of the New York State Senate, | charged
that. FBI Agents were -honeycombing New York State at the direction
' of Attorney General: ROBERT KENNEDY to gather. information ‘that
: could damage the. Administration of Governor ROCKEFELLER, "

The above appears in an articlo by JOHN WHEELER of the
North American Newspaper Alliance. For this reason, discretion
must. be utilized by all offices to avoid causing embarrassment
to the Bureau.

Buffalo is requested to determine: the address of
MILDRED MAHONEY in Florida. Miami, upon receipt of this informa-
tion from Buffalo, is requested to interview MILDRED MAHONEY
concerning CHARLOTTE MOYER. Philadelphia is requested, upon
receipt of background information from Miami, to obtain all
, available information concerning MOYER, and furnish same to the
NYO,
