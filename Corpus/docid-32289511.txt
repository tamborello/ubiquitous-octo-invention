by Legat, Havana (protect) as having been involved in a shooting
of a girl in Havana 11/13/58, However, the girl recovered and
claimed the shooting was accidental and that due to this
individual's influence with the subject along with subject's
influence, the BATISTA police regime made no official record

of the matter.

Sources reported that under the influence of the
subject, SCALIA thought of himself as a "big shot and gangster"
and left Havana where he had been in a high position at the
Sans Souci Casino for no particular reason other than it was
suspected that there was a reward for unknown favors rendered
to TRAFFICANTE,

Sources advised in December of 1959 that SCALIA
had indicated a desire to obtadn a Florida State Beverage
license in Miami, Florida, possibly the "Twenty-Two Club",

 

It was ascertained on 3/2/61 from Sgt. CHARLES
SAPP, Intelligence Unit, Miami PD, Miami, Florida, that y
SALVATORE SCALIA ran a grocery store in the 700 block of oo
W. Flagler, Miami, Florida and admitted to Sgt. SAPP that :
the subject had visited him in Miami but refused to advise
the sergeant where TRAFFICANTE was staying in Miami. SCALIA
advised Sgt. SAPP he came to the United States in 1955 from .
Italy, worked as a technician in Washington, D.C., then went ;
to Cuba where he worked as a technician and while in Cuba
met TRAFFICANTE., Sgt. SAPP advised SCALIA's grovery store
was nothing more than a hole in the wall, that his entire
inventory would not amount to $500 and that when he again
tried to contact SCALIA, SCALIA had sold hisstore, left Miami
and allegedly went to the West Coast to the State of Washington.

The Seattle Office advised by letter dated 5/28/59 -
regarding information received by Legat, Havana, that a RON
WARNOCK was reported making efforts to buy the Sans Souci
Gambling Casino from SANTO TRAFFICANTE .in Cuba and reported
that RON WARNOCK is the brother of TOM V. WARNOCK, Shriff of
Snohomish County, Washington 1/1/47 to 1/1/55 and that
informants have advised that since such time, RON WARNOCK has
been the “pick up" and "fix" man for that county.

 

s

The Seattle Office advised that they had a source,
EUGENE ALBERT PETERSON, close to RON WARNOCK who had also been fo
in contact. with SANTO TRAFFICANTE while in Cuba and who advised i-
that the source of capital that was to be used in purchasing
