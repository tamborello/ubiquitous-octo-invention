CRANDUM ‘FOR: C/CCS/DE

 

: 'TARASOFF, Boris D.
OSt 104 887

REFERENCE : DDS/IO5 Memorandum Dated 3 February 1972

, Per our 7 February 1972 telephone conversation with
Nr. concerning the contents of the above
Reference, WH/l’ reviewed Mr. Tarasoff's case. It is our

view that since § Tarasoii was under NOC cover prior to
his retirement in Mexico and since his U.S. Government
files of(éte as Ten Cagbeen | ac know tedscd publicly, that the

  

files of(Stonhe's Mercantile \should continue to be blocked.
Despite Iris retirement stat s, public knowledge of

Hr. Tarasoff's past association with the Agency could

nt to the latter. We suggest that
this case be reviewed again in 1973 in order to determine
if, at that time the blocking of the files of (Stone's zy
Nercentile \continues to be warranted.
