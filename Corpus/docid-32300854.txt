a PETRINO then agreed to the telephone call and he
said’ to LUBIN, "Tell JOHNNY I coulh't get in-any way.....
I don't like them looking to grab me...,it isn't nobody...
coppers are on me...I don't want this guy to get heated up".

. LUBIN then piicked up his telephone and asked for the number

of the Friar's Club, dialed the number that was apparently
given to him, and asked for JOHN ROSSELLI. ROSSELLI was not
there and LUBIN declined to leave a message, and said he would
call back later.

- On 6/1/64, the same source furnished information,

as a result of a conversation between LUBIN and HAROLD MELTZER,
that there are twenty guys "out here” that owe Chicago money
and there are people out here from Chicago to collect from
these guys. The possibility exists that the PETRINO conver- ,
sation with LUBIN pertains to the information concerning the
people who owe money to Chicago.

: The Las Vegas: Office advised that ROSSELLI checked
iiito‘the Desert Inn Hotel, possibly on 5/26/64, Information
has been previously furnished to the Bureau that ROSSELLI
allegedly left Los Angeles for Las Vegas on 5/28/64.
