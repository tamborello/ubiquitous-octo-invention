MEMBERS WHO DID NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AND HOPED PROVISIONS wouLD PE
IN PLACE TO ENABLE THEM TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE SCHEDULED
MULTILATERAL MEETINGS. HURRYING fO A RECEPTION SHORTLY AFTER
ARRIVAL FOLLOWING A LONG FLIGHT, HE DID NOT WISH TO BE LATE BUT
NEITHER DID HE WANT TO LEAVE OTHER DELEGATES FAR BEHIND. WHEN
IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THEY WOULD HURRY ONCE THEY SAW HE WAS
READY, HE COMMENTED -- WITHOUT ANY HINT OF REGRET -- THAT
EVERYONE WAS DEMOCRATIC NOW AND IT NO LONGER WORKED THAT WAY.

2. HE EVIDENTLY HAS A GREAT INTEREST IN, AND RESPECT
FOR, THE JAPANESE, REFERRING TO THEM AS A SPECIAL CIVILIZATION.
AT THE RECEPTION, HE AND JAPANESE DELEGATES AGREED TO MEET LATER
THAT NIGHT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS iN SPITE OF SOME BADLY NEEDED
REST.

2. A PERSON WHO LIKES TO ESTABLISH A ONE-ON-ONE
RAPPORT, HE EXPRESSED A REGRET AT NOT SPEAKING SPANISH SINCE

 

 

LATIN AMERICA IS ONE OF HIS MAIN AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY. HE
NOTED THAT LATIN AMERICANS DO NOT REALLY OPEN UP WHEN SPEAKING
THROUGH INTERPRETERS. TIME CONSTRAINTS PREVENT HIM FROM
LEARNING SPANISH AT PRESENT.

4. RCOLOGY - A SPECIAL CONCERN: MAMEDOV SHOWED A
PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR ECOLOGY AND NOTED THAT RUSSIA WOULD NEED
HELP IN DEALING WITH ITS PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA. HE RUEFULLY
COMMENTED THAT MAN WAS THE ONLY CREATURE THAT WOULD DESPOIL HIS
ENVIRONMENT. THE PROBLEM WAS A GLOBAL ONE AND REQUIRED
CONCERTED COOPERATION ON AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.

5S. PROBLEM AREAS FOR RUSSIA: ACCORDING TO MAMEDOV,
RUSSIA’S CURRENT OPEN BORDERS MAKE THE COUNTRY VULNERABLE TO
TERRORIST INCURSIONS (IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN WERE MENTIONED) AND
TO THE OVERFLOW ONTO RUSSIAN TERRITORY OF BORDER CONFLICTS.
WHEN PROBLEMS BEGAN IN AZERBAIJAN, IRAN SENT FIGHTING UNITS
ACROSS THE BORDER TO ASSIST AZERIS; RUSSIA WAS NOT NOTIFIED.
THE PROXIMITY OF THE CONFLICT IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND ITS
POSSIBLE ESCALATION IS VERY WORRTSOME. THE CIVIL WAR IN
CHECHNYA HAS “THE POTENTIAL OF BECOMING MORE SERIOUS AND IS A
VERY TROUBLESOME ISSUE.

6. THE ECONOMIC TRANSITION: MAMEDOV ASSESSES THAT
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH CANADA AND THE UNTTED
STATES, WILL BE STRENGTHENED THROUGH COMMERCIAL TIES. ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS IN RUSSTA STILL HAVE 50% GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT .
THE BANKING SECTOR IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS
INTERNATIONAL-STYLE BANKING. YOUNG MANAGERS (MID 30'S) ARE
INTRODUCING NEW IDEAS, WHILE OLDER EXPERIENCED STAFF PROVIDE THE
NECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. THE CURRENT PERIOD IN WHICH
RUSSIA IS BEING ROBBED BY SOME, IS SYMPTOMATIC OF TRANSITIONAL
UPHEAVAL AND IS COMPARABLE TO THE POST CIVIL WAR ERA IN THE
UNITED STATES WHEN A NUMBER OF ITS CITIZENS” ACQUIRED-WE

ESTABLISHED FACT.)

 

 

 

 

 

OPERATE UNDER THE GUISE OF RELIGIOUS FERVOR, NORMALLY HAVE AN
UNDERLYING FINANCIAL MOTIVE ACCORDING TO MAMEDOV. RUSSIA, AS
OTHER COUNTRIES, IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED THAT ADEQUATE
SAFEGUARDS BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT TERRORISTS FROM ACQUIRING
NUCLEAR MATERIALS. RUSSIA ALSO WANTS TO SEE AN IMPROVED
INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO DEAL MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH
TERRORISTS AND PREVENT THEM FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LEGAL .
LOOPHOLES .

& ——~4-—— COMMENTS ON TERRORISTS: Femvor, wommanoy saws an \ 4

8. MAMEDOV ALSO MADE THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ON SEVERAL
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

 

( (ZYUGANOV)}- ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS AND THE RESULTING
DISCONTENT HAVE ENHANCED HIS CHANCES AT THE PRESIDENCY. IT
\WOULD NOT BE OF CRITICAL CONCERN SHOULD HE WIN THE COMING
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SINCE THE COMMUNISTS HAVE UNDERGONE A
TRANSFORMATION AND WOULD NEITHER BE ABLE NOR WILLING TO TURN THE
;CLOCK BACK. THE NEW RUSSIAN COMMUNISTS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO
| ITALIAN COMMUNISTS BUT MAMEDOV WOULD DREAD TO SEB AN
ITALIAN-TYPE POLITICAL SCENARIO IN RUSSIA. THE RETURN OF
COMMUNIST PRESIDENTS IN POLAND, HUNGARY AND ROMANIA HAS NOT
CAUSED DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH WESTERN NATIONS, NOR
SHOULD THIS HAPPEN WITH RUSSIA.

((ZHIRINOVSKY})- A POLITICAL HOOLIGAN, ZHIRINOVSKY HAS
LOTS OF FINANCIAL BACKING. WITH HIS ATTENTION-GRABBING ANTICS,
HE PROVIDES A DIVERSION WHILE OTHER ELEMENTS CARRY ON THEIR
UNSAVORY (I.E. CRIMINAL) ACTIVITIES. IT REMINDS ONE OF THE
RUSSIAN TALE WHERE TWO CHARACTERS DISTRACT A CROWD WHILE THE
THIRD IS BUSY RIFLING THEIR POCKETS - ZHIRINOVSKY HAS PRESENTED
NO SERIOUS PROGRAM TO PERMIT HIM TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT VOTES.

 

((LEBED)) WITH HIS BASS VOICE AND PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT
APPEAL TO THE DISCONTENTED, HE HAS EARNED SOME POPULARITY, BUT
HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOLID PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE
AND WILL NOT BE A SERIOUS CONTENDER FOR THE PRESIDENCY .

 

 

 

 

9. RELATIONS WITH CANADA: MAMEDOV FAVORS CLOSER TIES
WITH CANADA AND PARTICULARLY IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE. THE
HALIFAX SUMMIT AND ((YELTSIN‘S)) BACKING FOR STRONGER ECONOMIC
COOPERATION WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD (1.E. THE CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT'S BLESSING IS ESSENTIAL TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN). THE
NORTH IS AN IMPORTANT COMMON FACTOR. FOR RUSSIA, DEVELOPMENT OF
THRIR NORTHERN SEA ROUTE WILL BE A HIGH PRIORITY AS IT WILL
PROVIDE A SHORTER LINK TO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING ROUTES.
