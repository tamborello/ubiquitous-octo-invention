THERE HAS BEEN A _NEED TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF. BRINGING ANERI AN INTELLIGENCE CLEA

SCHORR: DID YOU THINK THAT IT CGULD BE HANDLED AS AN INTERNAL REFORM’ PROCES
ANY PUBLIC EXPLANATION OR- Fustic RETRIBUTION? DIRECTOR COLBY: NE!

AND SENSATIONALISM.: AND I THINK. THE NORMAL CITIZEN IS. INCLINED To -THINK) THAT I SPEND
MY DAY IN THIS OFFICE PLOTTING ASSASSINATIONS. WELL, THE ACTUAL FINDING OF THE COMMITT
EE WAS REALLY QUITE REVEALING, BECAUSE: IT INDICATED THAT THIS AGENCY, -IN THE LAST 25 ¥
EARS, DID GO OUT TO. TRY TO BRING ABOUT THE END OF THE LIFE OF TWO INDIVIDUALS, NEITHER
OF WHOM DIED AS A RESULT. OF THAT EFFORT. THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO’ VE BEEN KILLED I
N THE PROCESS OF OPERATIONS, CERTAINLY; THERE ARE OUR OWN OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLE
D. THERE ARE FOREIGNERS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE COURSE OF REVOLUTIONS. AND COUPS, T
HINGS OF THAT NATURE. BUT THERE HAVEN’T BEEN ANY ASSASSINATIONS CONDUCTED BY THIS AGEN
CY. SCHORR: BUT THEY TRIED. DIRECTOR COLBY: THERE WERE TWO SITUATIONS IN WHICH CLEARLY
THIS PARTICULAR REPORT INDICATES THAT THERE WERE STEPS TAKEN HERE TQ BRING THIS ABOUT
. _BUT THEY DION’ T HAPPEN.. AND, YOU KNOW, OVER 25 YEARS, TO SAY THAT THAT. CHARACTERIZES
THE WORK OF THE AGENCY I THINK IS JUST PLAIN WRONG, AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A

PEOPLE WHO DON’T WANT YOU TQ CLEAN UP YOUR SHOP BECAUSE THEY’RE AFRAID OF THE CHAIN RE

SOME SUCH ACTION AGAINST THESE PEOPLE. TI AM. CONCERNED ‘BECAUSE “THE TESTIMONY -GIVEN-IN 7 o

ECY AGREEMENTS THAT APPLIED TO OUR EMPLOYEES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE. PROVIDED LARGE AMOUNTS oO:

F DOCUMENTATION TO. THE SENATE COMMITTEE SO THAT THEY. WOULD BE FULLY. INFORMED ON THESE

EVENTS.” THE PEGPLE WHO DID TESTIFY, I BELIEVE IN: GOOD FAITH. ANTICIPATED THAT THEIR EX. |

ECUTIVE SESSION TESTIMONY WOULD NOT BE FOLLOWED BY THEIR EXPOSURE FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL :

ACTIVITIES. I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE BE ‘SOME FEELING.THAT THERE BE AN OBLIGATION TO

REVEAL THESE. ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THERE IS SOME DISAPPROVAL OF. -THEM. . THIS DISAPPROVAL; 0:

F COURSE, IS SHARED BY: MANY OF US. THE PRESIDENT.-HAS EXPRESSED HIS CLEAR POLICY AGHINS
T ANY SUCH ACTIVITY. I HAVE ISSUED DIRECTIVES IN THIS AGENCY. TWO YEARS AGO WHICH ‘CLEAR -

LY PROHIBIT ANY INVOLVEMENT IN ASSASSINATION ACTIVITY, SO THERE’S REALL ee QUESTION A

BOUT WHETHER THIS IS. GOOD OR-BAD. IT IS BAD. THE REAL QUESTION is WHETH

"WILL IMPO +
SE -AN-EXTRA LEGAL RETALIATION ON PEOPLE WHO AT ONE TIME DIO WHAT THE GENERAL. CONSENSUS

OF THE PEOPLE AND THE. COMMAND STRUCTURE AROUND THEM THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE AT THE Tr |

ME, I BELIEVE THAT. IF ‘THERE IS DIAPPROVAL OF THESE ACTIVITIES, THERE ARE VEHICLES BY
WHICH WE CAN TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THEY DO NOT RECUR. THERE ARE ALSO VEHICLES BY bi
HICH ANY PARTICULAR PUNISHMENT COULD BE METED. QUT ACCORDING’ TO THE LAW, BUT I THINK TH
AT THE. EXTRA LEGAL, EX POST FACTO EXPOSURE OF GUR PEOPLE TO HOSTILE AND IRRATIONAL RET

FLIATION IS NOT WITHIN ‘THE TRADITION OF. OUR COUNTRY AND. CERTAINLY. IS TOO MUCH TO EXP °

ECT_OF PEOPLE WHO VOLUNTARILY ACCEPTED THE LIMITATIONS OF LIVES OF ANONYMITY AND SERVI
CE TO THEIR COUNTRY IN THE INTELLIGENCE BUSINESS. I THINK ONE ‘PARTICULAR THING THAT CO

IEVES HIMSEL:

SSTUN LAST BEEK, AS YOU KNQM, HITH THE HOUSE COMMITTEE AS TO THE GETAILS OF HOM BE Rou
LD OO THINGS. AND I THINK THAT IS AN ARRENGEMENT; IT’S A COMPROMISE SRRANGEMENT, Aho 1
TOHFFORGS 9 VEHICLE FOR REASONABLE MEN TO COME TO GOOG CONCLUSIONS AS TO WHAT SHOULS “a

ALISTS ARE VERY ENERGETIC IN PROSECUTING THE POSSIBLE STATEMENTS OF GNE MAN AND COMPAR

T THE MOMENT. BUT I HOULD HOFE THAT HE AMERICANS, AS WE TRY TG MAKE INTELLIGENCE RESPO
HSIBLE, WE CAN BE RESPONSIGLE QURSELYES IN THE MAY WE DO IT, WISE: MR. COLBY. Su SAID
THAT ASSASSINATION IS NOT A GOOG SUBJECT TO BE DISCUSSING PUBLICLY. BUT AT A HEARING
ABOUT THO WEEKS AGO. YOU DISPLAYED THAT FOISON DART GUN AT THE CHURCH COMMITTEE HEARIN
GIN THE SENATE. AND I WONDERED IF THAT GUN OR THAT TYPE OF HEAPON HAS BEEN USED AGAIN
ST ANY FOREIGN POLITICAL FIGURES. COLGY: THE GUN HBS NOT BEEN USED. -THE GUN MAS SROUGH
T UP THERE BECAUSE THE SENATE COHMITTEE RATHER INSISTED OM ITS BEING THERE. I GItN?T ¥
GLUNTEER IT, CERTAINLY. BUT IT WAS RA PART OF THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE ca
MMTTTEE. AND THERE WAS REALLY NO REASON TO SAY THAT IT WAS SO HIGHLY CLASSIFIED THET I

THAT GONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL. HOT GO AWAY 15 THE POPULAR MISUNDERSTANDING ABGUT THE
ASSASSIMATION OF PRESEDENT KENNEDY. I GUESS YOU'VE RUN INTO THAT. AND TIME FIND TIME A

’ Ken Knaus ~
E0/DDO 24 November 1976
rind omeer designation, room umber, and E COMMENTS (Number each comment to show from whom
se . - to whom. Draw a line ocross column efter each comment.)

You asked the other day .
about public statements made
by either Mr. Bush or Mr.
Colby concerning Agency
policy on assassinations.
Attached is far more. than I
am sure you ever wanted to.
know about this subject.

You will note however, among
all this. verbiage’ the only
really explicit public state-
ment against assassinations

or at least the only one

that the computer has recorded.
is the one made by Mr. Colby
in his TV appearance in ;
October 1975. Mr. Bush's

only public reference is in

an implicit rejection. Would
you please return these .
statements if you have no need
for them as I assume the
subject will reoccur each time "|
the new investigating committer
turns the subject over. :
