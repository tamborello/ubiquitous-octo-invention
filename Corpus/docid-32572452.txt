The above individuals are targets for early ‘prosecu=-
tion under the crash program. Both Mannarinos are notorious ’
hoodlums from the Pittsburgh area.

Departmental attorneys in Miami have requested that the
Bureau interview Joseph R,ilerola, a top jewel thief'> and hoodlum

currently residing in Miami, | a source of information concernigg
@ Mannarinos. The Departme torneys have indicated there is -:

. a possibility that Merola is willing to tell what he knows con-

. cerning the Mannarinos. We have talked to Merola on several
oceasions ‘in the past. While he has not been cooperative, the
Bureau has long recognized that if he were willing he could give
voluminous information not only on the Mannarinos but on many
other criminal matters. .

SAs Forsyth and Portella of the Pittsburgh Division
have in the past interviewed Merola, who has indicated that he
has confidence in these Agents. .Both these Agents are .thoroughly 4
familiar with all the ramifications: of the Mannarino cases as
well as other matters about which Merola could be expected to_
furnish information. In order to fully develop this potential,
SAS Forsyth and Portella of Pittsburgh have been instructed to
interview Merola-in Miami and develop all information in his
possession. This interview will not require these Agents to |
away from Pittsburgh more than two ‘days.
