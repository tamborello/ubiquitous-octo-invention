he told unman not to testify (to knowing MAGADDINO? ). MAGADDINO
retorted that they only asked about him because of "POPS"

(JOHN PAPALIA or one of the PAPALIA brothers) and “that

other guy" (ALBERT AGUECI?),and the "other things in New York."

MAGADDINO then began to discourse as to how this
unmen could testify by claiming inability to remember or
recall, and by claiming to have met numerous people. He : i
then asked when the investigation is to start, but the answer
was not learned by the informant. The conversation then
brought out the name of a newspaperman named (FNU) COLLINS,
CARLS or CORLINS (PH) whom all present derided as being ;
"bossy" and a "pig." -

MAGADDINO then reverted to the possible testimony
of unman who, according to MAGADDINO, could admit knowing
MAGADDINO, but only casually. and nothing of a derogatory
nature. .

Later, when MAGADDINO commented that he was proud
of the “family” he had raised, RANDACCIO asked in an '
apparently facetious manner which "family." MAGADDINO
expressed disapproval of RANDACCIO's comment, RANDACCIO |

; quickly added that MAGADDINO had done a good job with !
‘ "both families." MAGADDINO then related that his niece,
age 55, who lives on Devoe Street (Brooklyn, New York),
had been interviewed by the FBI regarding him. :

 

It was not clear to the informant from the above
information whether PETE BROCIOTA and the unman who is
apparently in the process of being subpoenaed to testify
before a Canadian Inquiry Board are identical.

On 5/20/64, fisurs by Bureau Agents in Buffalo
indicated personally owned car of RANDACCIO at his residence.
NATARELLI's car observed parked at Connecticut Street .
Athletic Club, Buffalo, which is a known hoodlum hangout.
Coverage by Bureau Agents was instituted at Chippewa,

Restaurant in Crystal Beach, Ontario, Canada, a small resort
near Buffalo. He stated that NASCA had become involved

with Canadian Customs authorities due to smuggling merchandise
into Canada in small quantities over a period of time and
having been reported. CI was not aware of the disposition

of this matter, but stated that NASCA was in extremely poor
financial straits due to high attorney's fees. "The Chief"

is believed to be identical to a Canadian gambler in the

Ft. Erie, Ontario area and Buffalo sources are being con-
tacted to fully identify him.

Records of the Toronto, Canada Telephone Company
showed on 5/21/64, that telephone number RO 9-2512 was
originally issued to G. TARANTULA of 95 Ashburnham, Toronto.
This same number was transferred to TARANTULA's current
address of 64 Cordella Street, Toronto, on 4/28/64. The
current Toronto City Directory lists a GUISEPPI TARANTA,

a bricklayer,as residing at 6h Cordella Street. There

is no record for TARANTULA or TARANTA in the records of

the Metropolitan Toronto Police Department (MTPD) or the
indices of the Buffalo Office. Information developed to
date indicates that "DON SIMONE" mentioned by CLI is possibly
DOMINICK SIMONE, a well-known Toronto hoodlum and associate
of JOHN PAPALIA. . :

With reference to the JOSEPH FALCONE mentioned
by RANDACCIO, it should be noted that BU 280-C* tentatively
identified a visitor of STEVE MAGADDINO in the-morning and
afternoon of 5/19/64 as JOSEPH FALCONE of Utica, New York.
The Albany Office was telephonically contacted on 5/20/64,
to ascertain,if possibly, the whereabouts of FALCONE on
5/19/64, and to determine if he is by chance known to be
in the Buffalo or nearby Canadian areas. On 5/21/64, the
Albany Office telephonically advised that FALCONE had been
observed at his residence in Utica between 2:00 and 3:00
p.m. on 5/19/64.

The information furnished by CI in this matter
is being disseminated to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP), Toronto, on a confidential basis and with due care
given to protecting the source.
