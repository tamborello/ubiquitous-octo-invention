RE: Mary Ceciliadell Bertucci

This lady placed a-call to our Committee at 2:30 p.m.
on July 18, 1978, seeking Mr. Bill Brown, and. spoke to me
when advised the former would no longer be available. ’

She advised she and her husband had been interviewed
on past occasions by Brown and it was impérative these
reports be modified regarding "the reward." Previously she
had indicated she wasn't concerned with the one hundred
thousand dollars, but she's since reconsidered and has decided
to accept this recompense.

I checked the files and reviewed 5117 (2/7/78), 7196
(4/14/78), and 7255 (4/18/78) submitted by Bill Brown and found

she reiterated the essential story. Today's notes added the
following data:

1. Maiden name Tinner; DOB, 9/28/43; SS qovreact 6) |

2. John Fitzgerald Kennedy was her first cousin. (It
was due to circumstances that they never met.)

3. Judge Garrison is her attorney of record.

4. She's currently confined to "Parker 3 West" of
De Paul Hospital in New Orleans, with 11 of the
15 days" confinement to go.

None of these four items verified at this time.
