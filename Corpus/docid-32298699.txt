RE: Newark letter dated 6/8/65
, 0-1 dated 6/29/65

\ The information in the Newark file concerning - ‘cap=
tioned. matter has been furnished by Criminal informants and
Highly Confidential ‘Sources, ;

. Newark has conducted no open investigation in this
case, since there has been no indication of violation of ;
Federal Gambling Statutes, Further reason for no investigation
is that New Jersey State Police contemplates a raid of the game
as soon as their investigation justifies that action,

. Two Newark Informants (NK 2381-C-TE and NK 2181-C)
have attended this game in the past and efforts. are being made
.to have one of these sources visit the game again in order
to assist the New Jersey State Police in obtaining a search
warrant. : .

.. :. In view of no apparent Federal violation and ‘the
fact that information available precludes submission of an
intelligent report in the 166 classification, this case is
being placéd in a closed status, _

This matter will be re-opened as a 162 ~ IGA class=
ification and a report will be submitted by 7/16/65/
