threatened with the thought of going to prison. In 1964

Sal MORGAN (201-33001

occasions. He applied for and received a permanent
residence visa to the U.S. and returned to take up residence
in New York City in 1953, He became a naturalized U.S.
citizen in late 1958. He returned to Cuba in January 1959.
He was ordered to organize and head a ministry police force
responsible for security of gfounds and property of the
tiinistry, (Ministry for Recovery of Stolen Property.) In
late 1959 he joined the G-2. In December 1959 he became
acquainted with Santos TRAFFICANTE, /extensive info. see
copy of dispatch attached.7 TRAFFICANTE reportedly wanted
to remain in Cuba and was prepared to cooperate with the
Castro Government in order to continue business as usual.
One person in the G-2 most willing to become involved with
TRAFFICANTE was Manuel PINEIRO, a high intelligence official.
PINEIRO's reasoning was that TRAFFICANTE and the Mafia had
collaborators in the U.S. Government and the FBI which could
be useful to support G-2 operations in the Miami area,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Traces on Santos TRAFFICANTE

1. There is no official 201 file on TRAFFICANTE,
Following are extracts from references in Agency files:

a. Memo for the Record dated 6 March 1964 on
Moises SANTI y Marcheli, sourced to AMNIP-1
(Miguel ROCHE - former G-2 defector)

1. This memo concerns the involvement of
AMNIP-1 (A-1) with a group in Cuba headed by SANTI, in
exchanging dollars for Cuban pesos, A-l's involvement
was by invitation of SANTI who turned out to be G-2.. SANTI
told A-1 that they would have to be on the alert because
of other important group, also involved in money changing,
directed by Evaristo GARCIA, then in Miami and a friend of
Cuban gambler fnu SANTOS Trafficante (sic);;Roberto SUSI;
and fnu LEAL, with whom they would sooner or later have
trouble. Money was sent to Miami by diplomats accredited to
Cuba in the false bottom of a cardboard suitcase made by
ae ®ANTI's younger brother in the latter's office in “old
eee . Havana." The suitcase was received in Miami by a person
—_ of confidence who had a passport and a visa. Travel’ by
plane and permissio to leave the country was obtained by
SENTI through the Chief of the Department of Technical
Investigations (DTI) of the Department of Investigation of
the Rebel Army (DIER) at the International Airport at
Rancho Boyeros. Suitcases with false bottoms for the other
groups were also made by SANTI's brother as he was the only
one who could make them with perfection. A crisis did
develop between SANTI and the other. groups, because they
diverted money exchanges to themselves.

2, SANTI reportedly left Cuba on a Greek ship
(date unknown). In October 1962 SANTI had reportedly just
opened a store in New Orleans, Louisiana. A~1l learned from
a person in Miami in 1963 that SANTI had said he was prepar-
ing a false bankruptsy for his store in New Orleans. SANTI
also reportedly declared a false bankruptsy for a store he
owned in Caracas, Venezuela, when he returned to Cuba
following the downfall of Batista.
