Dear Mr. Torricelli:

In response to your letter of February 28, 1995
regarding the whereabouts of Mr. Gilberto Lopez, we have
examined Agency records and have found no reference to his
activities after his departure from Mexico in November 1963.
With regard to the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, Joaquin
Hernandez de Armas, our information is that he remained
Cuba's Ambassador to Mexico. He was recalled to Cuba in
July 1970 to attend the ending of the sugar cane harvest.
Our records reflect that he died in Cuba in September 1972.
(Ss)

If you have any further questions, please do not
hesitate to call. (VU)

Sincerely,

oanne O. Isham
Director of Congressional Affairs
