HALL, Loran Eugene, aka Lorenzo PASCILLO wi Page 2°of 47 pages

developed: HALL stated that he took part in the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cubag

  

HALL is presently on a fund-raising campaign in the United States to raise money, 1»? ante

for an invasion which is' allegedly scheduled to take part in Cuba on 12 September of

“1963. HALL stated that the purpose of this invasion of.Cuba is to counteract a

"pseudo" invasion of Cuba which is sdeduled to take place on 18 September 1963.

The invasion of 18 September 1963 is slated to be headed by three gyoups, one of
which is to depart from Guatemala, one from Nicaragua, and the third’ groups

point of departure is unknown. HALL related that each of the thrée groups is led
by a known Cuban Communist. HALL stated the CIA is aware of the invasion of 18
September but has been led to believe that these three group leader. are former
Cuban Communists: who are now. "anti-Castro". Actually, Hell stated, these group
leaders are still ‘active Communists. The invasion of 18 September 1963 has been
designed to oust Castro from Cuba but still retain a Commmnist regime thereby ”
allowing the present U. S. administration to play down the Cuban issue for politi- ..
cal purposes. HALL stated the new regime in Cuba will give the appearance of .
over-throwing CASTRO and the establishment of a democratic government but in effect

‘will still be a Communist stronghold and Soviet controlled. HALL alleges that

the present administration is fully aware of the outcome of the invasion planned
for 18 September 1963. HALL stated that the administration is "for" that invasion
so that the Cuban situation will not be an issue in the forthcoming election. HALL.
stated that the next election for president will probably be between KENNEDY and
GOLDWATER and that GOLDWATER is presently "riding high" politically on the Cuban
situation. HALL stated the purpose of his invasion scheduled for 12 September 1963.
is to destroy refineries, powerplants, etc., and to fight against the forces
invading on 18 September. HALL stated he also plans to take motion pictures of

the action and return to the United States for further fundzraising speeches.
The polygraph eXsminer, BARRICK, stated that HALL agreed not to accept money from
the John Birch Society until his return to the U. S. after the inv -sion. BARRICK
related that HALL appears to be Cuban in that he is dark ana wears a beard but

has no Cuban” accent. BARRICK further related that HALL is apparently: vehemently
anti-Semitic in that HALL claims that of the one hundred forty top advisers in

the present administration, one hundred four of them are “atheistic Jews". Each “
time the subject of Jews came up in their conversation, BARRICK related, HALL

 

nearly “went through the roof" berating them. BARRICK stated that thé.individual

requesting the polygraph examination, TEUNNISON, appears to be well-read on
Communism and "seemed to know what he was talking about". TEUNNISON alleges that
the man directly under J. EDGAR HOOVER in the structure of the FBI-is slated to
take HOOVER's job in the event of his death or retirement. Thi- inaividual, whose

“name BARRICK could net recall, supposedly was deported from this country for

his activities in the Communist Party many years ago and return in the early 1950's
to take his present job. .TEUNNISON stated that the planned invasion of 18 September
is just a part of the “international conspiracy” designed to take over this and

- other democratic countries.

3. HALL was given a polygraph examination as to his intentions regarding his
activities in the planned invasion of 12 September 1963. The results of the
examination were reviewed by the undersigned. Although the results were some-what
slight and difficult. to determine, the results indicated teaghtruthfulness and

no deception was indicated. It is the opinion that the test was not properly
constructed in thefthe relevant questions were not of significant strength, «

HALL, Loran Eugene, aka-.Lorenzo PASCILLO "page 3 of .~_ pages —
