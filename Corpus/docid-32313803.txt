time, no information developed by the FBI is made available to
Golitzyn without specific Bureau authority. They stated that with re-
gard to Nosenko's information, they would like to secure Bureau per-
mission to make the results of our investigation (based on Nosenko’
information) availabie to Golitzyn for his review and analysis. Th
feel that this will be necessary for successful handling of the No
interrogation. They also advised that in the forthcoming interview -
Krotkov they would like to have similar permission from the Bureau for.
any investigation we have conducted based on Krotkov's information, but
it is noted that Frotkov had very little information concerning ac-
tivities in the United States and had no information concerning any
Americans supposedly cooperating with the Soviets.

 
 
 
 

OBSERVATIONS

. Both CIA and [the pritisi?onain absolutely convinced that both
Nosenko and Krotkov Kishen oe cae If this is so, then the Soviets
are well aware <i wha Ormation they have furnished us and. the infor-
mation is of no value for future operational use to us. it is believed
in view of this that we should accede to CIA's request and permit them to
make available to Golitzyn for his analysis the information we have de-
veloped by our investigation based on Nosenko's information,, with the un-
derstanding. that the information will be paraphrased and Golitzyn will
not see any actual FBI reports or communications. It would appear we
could lose little from this and if we did not agree and CIA is not
successful in their interviews of Nosenko and Krotkov, they could always
claim that they might have been successful had the Bureau, permitted the
use of the results of our investigation,
