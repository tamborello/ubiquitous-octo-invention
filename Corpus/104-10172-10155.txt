Appraisal of Content: 3..

1. Tho militia is no longer regarded by the Cuban Government as a serious
faotor in internal or external defense. Instead, it is used ag a recruiting
ground for the Armed Forces, which are now thoroughly profeseional and

well-trained.

2. Armed clashes between opposition groups and goverment forces have ooourred
in several provinces, including Matanzas ,-Camagusy, ani Pinar del BLOe

3. ‘There has been a notable increase in sabotage since February or March 1962.

' ‘Buildings and factories have been blow up or burned, cane fiolds set on
fire, and above all, passive reistance has grown in certain industries,
especially the sugar refining industry. A different pattern of sabotage
has emerged. Instead of setting off explosive or incendiary bombs where
they might cause logs of life or injury, thus arousing popular resentment
against the opposition,targets are chosen for the maximm financial damage

or dislocation.
