wife Edna,, who resides at 39 Lorne Street.

 

  

2. Prior to interviewing irs. ELLICTT, our inves-
tigator established that cdna ELLIOTT and Patricia Ann
. BOWEN were sisters, Mrs. ELLIOTT being 15 years senior.
my. It was also established that GROSSI nad visited at the
ELLIOTT home in 1963 and that William and cdna =LLIOTT
had a very poor opinion of GROSSI, however, tolerated him
4n consideration of Mrs. BOWEN.

36 Mrs. ELLIOTT was interviewed on January 18,

however could offer no information whatever of value.

She stated she had maintained close contact with her wos
sister, both by letter and. telephone. She openly stated:

her dislike for GROSSI and advised she would assist to :
locate him in any way possible. .

Investigation is continuing.
