NUNEZ recalled that in the U. N. General Assembly of last year Cuba had aspired
to a seat on the Security Council and hsd had the promise of Panamanian support
in this matter; however, Cuba had withdrawn when Peru claimed precedence in ita
right to a seat on the Security Council, He also indicated that at’ present

Cuba is soliciting support, through its diplomatic representatives, for a seat
on the Sacurity Council which will meet in November 1955, and, because at present
there is no other Latin Anecican member of the U. N. with similar asp{rations,

ha does not anticipate any conflict of intsrest, NUNEZ stated that the Cuban
request for support had been replied to affirmatively by Chile, Argentina, Hon<
duras, Haiti, Casta Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Peru.

request for support in this matter. NUNS2 added that if he becomes a ‘member of
tha Security Council FABREGA may consider that he will represent Panama as well
as Cuba, He reminded FABREGA that, because of recommendations which NUNEZ made,
Cuba voted in the Genetal Assembly for Ricardo ALFARO, Panamanian jurist, for a
position on the International Court of Justice as well as a position on the In-
ternational Law Commission, when this was requested by the Panamanian Government.
