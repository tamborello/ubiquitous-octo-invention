a A CHRONOLOGY OF UNEVALUATED REPORTS ON
eu. RECENT SOVIET MILITARY AID TO CUBA

Early July 1962--Around 12 July Fidel Castro personally
ordered the evacuation of a farm just south of
Havana city, Saying he needed all the farms border-
ing a special zone, Rumors were that the area was
to be used for military storage.

15 July-15 August--In this period 18 Soviet ships with rela-
tively light loads passed Istanbul from Soviet: ports
‘on the Black Sea and falsely declared their destina-
tions; COMINT later indicated that all 18 were bound
for Cuba. Such Soviet behavior has frequently in-
dicated military shipments in the past, and many of
the 18 ships involved are frequent arms carriers,
Subsequent reports have confirmed that many of these
ships did in fact deliver military or military-
related equipment to Cuba. During the same period

two Soviet ships traveled to Cuba from the Baltic _

with small naval craft on deck. pe
95 July--Residents of several private homes in the vicinity
of a former reformatory near El Chico, Havana prov-
ince, were ordered to vacate their homes within 72

“fours, Cuban authorities told the residents that
