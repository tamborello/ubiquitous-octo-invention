Service, Federal Narcotics Bureau, and local law enforcement
agencies, These investigations have developed that the Italian
orimiaal element has had little success in operating as an
organization in the Dallas area, CIVELLO'’s activities are
very limited and his associates tend to operate individually,
either in Legitimate enterprises or in gambling activities.
There has been no evidence that CIVELLO actually controls or
axbitrates disputes among the Italian element in Dallas.
CIVELLO is said to be im a “stand-by” position due to the fact
that the organization is mot able to operate as such in Dallas
because of the local law enforcement.

in any criminal activity since the Apalachin Meeting, 11/14/57.

activity at this time. Reliable informants and all other
law enforcement agencies im’ the . Dallas area are well aware of ,
