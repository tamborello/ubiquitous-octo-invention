On 3/23/61, the informant advised that LA ROCCA had just
returnaifrom Florida and had entered his office at the North
Star Cement Block Co. at approximately 2:15 PM. Informant
advised that LA ROCCA appeared to be extremely tanned and
physically fit and indicated that he would be in the Pittsburgh
area for an undetermined period. Indications were that he
would seek some information on the automation of his plant on
or about 3/27/61.

On 3/24/61, the informant advised that SAM TEDESCO visited
North Star but did not indicate whether or:not he came to
see LA ROCCA. TEDESCO is. known to the Pittsburgh Office as
a burglar and expert safeman who is extremely active in

the Southern Ohio area. His prior connection with LA ROCCA
has not fully been determined but his activities are being
fully covered by a live informant, PG 575-C.

On 3/27/61, LA ROCCA was in his office and was advised,

according to this informant, that JOHN CONTI and ROY VEY,

who were operating the company in his absence, have "deactivated"
AIMO PRUNER as Vice President of the "association," although

he still holds this position in what is ostensibly a cement

block organization. LA ROCCA asked if it were true that this
"association" is "cutting" prices and was advised by CONTI arid
VEY that the “association” is doing a lot more than this and

that they do not feel that North Star should become involved

in view of the position of LA ROCGA. LA ROCCA did not comment
upon this. The informant advised that it appeared that LA ROCCA
was attending to some personal affairs and would put. in regularly
scheduled appearances at his office as soon as he straightens

up some details to which he did not attend while he was vacation-
ing in Florida.

On 3/28/61, this informant, advised that LA ROCCA visited his
property at 500 North Craig St., Pittsburgh, during the late
morning hours of 3/27/61, and inquired whether the FBI had
been there looking for him or asking any questions relative
to the operation of several businesses to whom he is renting
at that location. The informant stated that LA ROCCA is anxious :
to sell the entire building at the aforementioned address but '
will not’ name his price and must. be called personally by anyone

desiring to buy or inspect. He stated that this sale will not

include the carwash which adjoins 500 North Craig St.
