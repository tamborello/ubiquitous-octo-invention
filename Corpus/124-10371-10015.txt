A, The Partido Revolucionario del Pueblo (PRP)

to Ignacio LEDON, responsibility for the disintegration of the
PRP falls on its leader Antonio SANTIAGO, whom |] describes
as.a "farsante." Lore a aoe : GC). ;
Se B. Mario RIVADULLA, a member of the PRP Executive,
“Committee who now lives in Santo Domingo, told that )
. it is impossible to organize a pglitical movement in exile
which would be capable of influencing in any way the develop-

ment of events in Cuba.  RIVADULLA now believes that there

events in Cuba and a possible:overthrow or assassination of
‘Castro by the military. ‘

aoe Or LJ ittencea a meeting of about 15 persons
on 16 August presided over by Rolando MASFERRER, Director
_of the weekly "Libertad." MASFERRER told the participants
‘that they should begin firing practice on a Florida farm to

and with the government of Chile. Ramiro de LA FE claimed oe
already to have contact with Patricia-BERDUGO, a-Chilean ;
