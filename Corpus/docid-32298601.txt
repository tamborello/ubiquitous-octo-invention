ReBulet of 7/24/68, states that recent contact by
Chicago informants with SUE FRANK "may be expected to greatly
enhance, the intelligence potentialfof the Ad Hoc Committee
(AHC). It is also stated that the Bureau will consider another
trip by these informants to NYC in the fall to recontact SUE
FRANK and that. Chicago shoyld consider accepting FRANK's offer
