23 Nowhere 1963

PO: Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Attention: Mr. 6. J. Pepich

FROM: Deputy Director, Plans

SUBJECT: Lee H. OSWALD, Suspected Assassin of President Kennedy

L. Reference is made to CIA Out Teletype Shinber Sh915, dated
Q3 November 1963.

Be Forverded a as Enclosure A is‘ a. tvenseript of ‘the 28 ‘Beptenber
1963 telephone call. reported in referenced teletype and of a 1 October
1963. phone ¢all to the Soviet Eubassy by a man who identified himself
ab Lee OSWALD. It is noted. that the “North Auerican" whe participated
in the first call 1s the sane man who identified himself as Lee OSWALD
in the ‘second.

3.  Porvarded as Enclosure B is « transcript. of three phone calls.
made on. 27 Beptember 1963, one made on 1 October 1963 and one made on
3 Cetober 1963. Voice comparisons indicated that the "North American"
who participated in séveral of these conversations is probably the
perpon-who identified himself ag Lee OSWALD om 1 October 1963.

ke Gur tentative. eonelusion from reading these trenseripte is
that OSWALD went to the Boviet Embassy hoping to get. a visa to go to
the Soviet Union and live and thet, failing to get. it quickly, he -
tried to get a Cuban transit visa so he would go to Cuba end wait for
the granting of the Soviet vies. ‘This is also thé conclusion reached
by Silvie Duran, the Mexican netional employee of the Cuban Exbessy
who déalt with OSWALD.
