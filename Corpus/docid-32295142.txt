as Supervisor ofan airline which operates between Jamaica and
Venezuela, Subject is apparently e Cuban and his visa
application was accordingly referred to our office in Kingston.

A the United States authorities that he justifies re-tention -
ty on the black list. : .

Ne “By It would seem that refusal by Jamaica of a Cuban visa

aw - application would not endanger sources but should Jamaica

BS decide ‘to do this in respect of a person on the I.N.S. black
list presumably covering approval from I.N.S. should first
