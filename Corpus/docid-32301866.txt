_ “CG. 105-8235

. Regarding the alleged plans of JOHN SELTZ and JACK,
NORDEEN of Chicago to organize an attempt to overthrow the }
government of Nicaragua, the following observations are :

considered pertinent: '

SELTZ,-age 21, the subject of Bufile 62-105585,

Chicago file 105-8235, Miami file 2-262, was last interviewed
September 26, 1960, by the Chicago Division, SELTZ was
determined to be a headstrong, immature individual of
considerable means who has expressed a desire to "free all
the backward nations of the world", - . ae

NORDEEN, age 23, the subject of Bufile 62-105584,
Chicago file 2-71, Miami file 2-257, was last interviewed
August 4, 1960, by the Chicago Division, A PSI investigation
reflected that NORDEEN (who had shot and killed his younger
brother in 1956) was considered to be an erratic, unstable
individual "full of fantastic ideas", Upon interview June 4,
1959, NORDEEN told of working with the Castro forces in Cuba.
in 1958 and 1959 and then in June, 1959, travelling to
Oklahoma to search for gold, .

. In. view of the above, it is felt that the informa
tion furnished by SAUL SAGE does not provide sufficient
_,basis for further investigation of SELTZ and NORDEEN,
i Accordingly, unless directed otherwise by the Bureau,
| Springfield may discontinue on the lead set out, in relet and
| Chicago will conduct no investigation of SELTZ and NORDEEN
,

at this time.
~ For the information of WFO, Chicago, with the

concurrence of ,the Bureau, no longer initiates contact with
CONSTANTINE GLES, former-legal-.counsel for the Castro.

cy t Government..in_ the U,S but accepts any information
CE Gover. A The UV Deng
‘Se volunteered by KANGLES.

| AW 53074

Chicago will remain alert to any pertinent
information regarding SELTZ and NORDEEN and their
participation in any activities of interest to this office,
