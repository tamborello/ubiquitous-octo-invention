(C) This is to alert you to an issue that has been raised regarding release of sensitive CIA information by the JFK Assassination Records:
Review Board. At its meeting on 14 October, the Board decided to release records that identify tn Secor Center as.an
Agency facility. Responsible components in the DA object to this release.

. FOUO) Consequently, OIM, OFSS, OGC, and we are recommending that Dick Calder send @ memorandum to the JFK Board Chair
(Judge Join Tunheim) asking the Board to reconsider its decision. We'll also propose to Tunheim that a senior officer brief the Board on.
the issue. . : : oo

(Fouo) If the above steps are unsuccessful, then it is likely that the responsible components would recommend that the Agency appeal
the Board's decision to the President, as allowed under the JFK Act. OGC would prepare any appeal for the EXDIR's approval.
