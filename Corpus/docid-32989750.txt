Atlanta noted in conducting this review, that
a few of the original Elsur logs had several entries made
with a light blue ink and as a result:;s, these entr¥es were
somewhat faint on the xerox copies. Efforts to improve
the quality of these particular copies of the Elsur logs
were: unsuccessful as the light blue ink does not copy
well. :

It is noted that Atlanta has placed a three by
five card as a flag on the serials listed below, namely:

Atlanta Serials 157-582 A-33

as these serials had information in various paragraphs,

that by its nature, identified a former confidential source
of the Atlanta Office and this information should be deleted
prior to being furnished to the HSCA. These three by five
card flags set forth the appropriate paragraphs that should
be deleted in these serials.
