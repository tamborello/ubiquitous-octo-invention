contact I had with Sommersett was initiated by Sommersett,

_ and any information developed as a result was accepted at
face value and either verified or discredited, as the case
may have been. To my knowledge, Sommersett. was not paid
for any information he furnished to the FBI during my tenure
handling extremist matters.

Whatever contact the Miami Police Department had |
with Sommersett is unknown to me with the exception of a
bombing matter which fell under the jurisdiction of the Miami
Police Department and of which Sommersett apparently had
direct knowledge. I was shown a memorandum by the House of i
Representatives interviewing officials which was allegediy
written by an Officer Sap of the Miami Police Department on
April 25, 1968, to Chief of Police Headley, wherein Officer :
' Sap stated he had developed information from Sommersett on
April 3, 1968 indicating that Martin Luther King would be
- killed in Memphis, Tennessee. I never met Officer Sap and
never saw this memorandum. I do not recall Sommersett or
any Miami Police Department official relating any of the
information contained in this memorandum to me.

Prior to the conclusion of this interview, I was
’ asked about several names which were unknown to me .and. was.
interrogated about any knowledge I might have regarding an
FBI "Cointell" (phonetic) Program as it pertained to the Miami
Division. I have no knowledge of this program in the Miami
Division or anywhere else in the Bureau.

At the conclusion of the interview, I was advised
that I would be notified of any further inquiries in this
matter wherein my presence or testimony would be necessary.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS

INTERVIEW OF
SPECIAL AGENT DAVID N. JELLISON

On March 29, 1978, I, David N. Jellison, Special

Agent with the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, was interviewed by Richard C. Wrose,

Mark Speiser, and Wendy Collins, investigators,’ and

Peter G. Beeson, Staff Counsel, for the United States House
. of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations.

This interview took place at the House of Representatives
* Select Committee Office Building, Washington, D.C.

At the outset, I identified myself as a Special
Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and obtained
names and titles of the interviewing officials. I also
furnished my date of birth, Social Security Number, and general
background information relating to my FBI career to date. I
specifically furnished the date I commenced my assignment in
the Miami Division as June 1966. Upon arriving in Miami, I was
assigned to the investigation of civil rights and extremist
matters as they existed in the Miami Division at that time.
In this regard, I was assigned to handling the Martin Luther King
en investigation as leads developed in the Miami Division
yn e

 

I was asked to comment on any contact I had with
William Sommersett, an extremist source in the Miami Division
at the time I was assigned to investigate extremist matters.
To my recollection, regular contact with Somersett had been
discontinued prior to my arrival in Miami due to his unstable
behavior and to avoid possible embarrassment to the Bureau.
I am of the opinion that for some years prior to-1966,
Sommersett had furnished reliable information to the Bureau
relating to both extremist and criminal matters. Any direct
