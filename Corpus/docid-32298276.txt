MI 92-262

Informant does not know JOE ZERILLI (alleged
boss of the Detroit family).

From the above, and as indicated by the informant,
he is in no position to know if any new members have been
taken into the Detroit LCN family since 1946-1947,

Regarding the possibility of sons of LCN members
inheriting "the right to become members" of the LCN, in-
formant stated that to the best of his knowledge, this
has not been done and is not done. Informant pointed out.
that among many, and probably the majority of present LCN

“members known to him, these members purposely avoid having
their sons become involved in the LCN and related illegitimate

or criminal activities, In this regard, informant pointed
out that many long-time LCN members in view of developments
in recent years feel that they have been "Stuck" with their
membership, and it is difficult and sometimes impossible

to break away from the organization and friends who are
members, Such disilussioned members, in effect, fear the
stigma of their association with the LCN,

Informant said that as far as he knows, he feels
quite certain that sons of members would have to prove
themselves and go through the initial procedures. Informant
said that it would not be necessary for such prospective
members to prove themselves by fulfilling a contract to
make a "hit" on anyone, :

The statement among LCN members that "He was
made", means that the individual was initiated into the
LCN, The statement, "He is his father's son", in LCN
jargon possibly means that a son takes after. his father.
However, this does not mean that the son is a member of
the LCN, because of his father's membership. . .

For the confidential information of Detroit,
MI 623-C-TE is a long-time member of the Milwaukee LCN
family. Any reporting or utilizing of the above information
from this informant should be paraphrased and should not
indicate in any way that this information came from the
Milwaukee area, To do so could compromise the informant
and jeopardize his personal well being.
