In. view of Bureau instructions contained im referenced Bureau ,
letter and set forth under the Administrative Data of this
report, the New York Office is requested to review case -
captioned, "BERNARD J. EZHAYA; EP AL; ITSP-MT," to ascertain
any legical persons who may have authored the anonymous letters
pertinent to this investigation. In this regard it. is noted
that- those communications of which copies have been directed
to the Pittsburgh Office have been reviewed. It is also
logical to assume that anyone who would have the information
furnished in. these letters would have to be associated in some

manner with the MANNARINOs, LOUIS COHEN and possibly with JOHN vs
