ing of WALTER GLOCKNER, and that his associates haa no idea

From these conversations, the informant stated that

told Herold Fitssisnens on the morming of 5/24/63 that he had the
License number ef the automobile which. sped from the scene of the
shocting is Frank EKimwerle or whether there may be another witness
who has not yet been located, ‘Necessary investigntion to clarify
this goint should be conducted.

{It ig noted furthér that rerep does not indicate that
during interviews some. persons who may be suepects in this case

should ineure that in aii interviews conducted in the future with

oe ; rn
On the basis of information set out in rerep and in the
veport of SA Russel F. Sullivan, dated 6/7/63 at New York, it is ~
suggested that the following lines of investigation, in\addition to
the other investigation which is-now under way, be pursued to a
proper conclusion. - _ \

\ \ ‘

New York PCY John Strong advised that Tom Benny, "Bull" Keany
and "Borky” Daley, friends ofTkowis J. Reynolds, are strong-aro sen
and carry guns. It appears that the only investigation which
has been conducted is an Anterview with Thomas Keany ‘set cut on
page 216 of rerep. Accerding to this individual, “Werky"” Baley
died several years ago. Wo information was developed ner was
any investigation conducted concerning “Bull” Kenny, it is suggested
that inguivies be made in an effort to verify the death ef "Porky"
Daley; that "Bull" Kenny be identified, lecated and interviewed; me
that statements be obteined from hin and Thomas Kenny as te their where-
abouts during the pertinent peried and that investigation be conducted
to verigy or vefute the alibis that they furnish. Efforts should be
made to determine further whether these individuals have been known to
carry guns. Uf so, the guns should be located and considered 2s

possible suspect weapons im connection with the shooting of
Glockner, . : ,

Similar investigation should be conducted with respect te
Richie Barrett and Tomay Clark, former employees of the Quinn Freight
Lines who, according to Joseph Mitchell smith, are closely associated
with Reynolds. Smith also said that Barrett usually carries a
pistol. Ufforts also should be made te verify Smith's statement
that Nunzio Provenzano reportedly was seen giving money to Barrett
and Clark. If this can be substantiated the reason’ for Nunzio
Provenzano paying these individuals should be determined,

With respect to the gun invelved in the murder of Glockner,
it is noted that the laboratory repert of the New Jersey State
Police, set out on pages 306 and 307 of rerep, did not state the
make of weapon used in the murder or the probable make of this
weapon. For the information of Newark and New York, the FBI Labora-
tory has advised that frem descriptive data set out in the mentioned
laboratery report it appears that the bullets would have been fired
from a Colt revolver chambered for .38 caliber Smith and Wesson
cartridges. This opinion is based én the fact that the rifling
characteristics are six jands and’ grooves with a lefthand twist.

The possibility also should not be overlooked that some Spanish made
revolvers may have similar rifling: characteristics. :

Newark and New York should consider the feasibility of
examining pistel permits issued by lecal authorities in an effort
to determine whether any permits were issued to officials or members
ef Local 560 or their associates for a .38 caliber Colt revolver.
If so, consideration should be given to endeavoring to lecate the
weapons in order. that test specimens may be fired from them.

Investigation should be made te determine whether Angelo
§peracs, reported by NK2282-€ as a strong-aru man for the union and
as having visited the office of Teamsters Local 810 in New York City
twice during the week prior to 5/24/63 accempanied by Nunzio
Provenzano and Sal Briguglio, was involved in the murder of Glockner.
Sporaco’s whereabouts during the pertinent period should be ascer-
tained and necessary investigation conducted to verify or refute his
alibi. :
