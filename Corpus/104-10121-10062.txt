MOSBY, Aline #172252

According to several sovvces Boris Y. Belitskiy is an associate of
Aline Mosby, whose name eppeared in Oswald's address book. (Page 61 of
the address book, which is on page 22 of the FBI memorandum of 31
December 1963. She is mentioned else in CI/SIG's cover memorandum
dated 10 January 1964.)

According to sr/2/cE, #56948 SD & SSD, in September
1958, Aline Mosby was irect contact with Boris ¥. Belitskiy, a
Russian official at-the -Brussels- World, ir, and "was the center of a
great deal of activity for (him)". €} stated that Belitskiy, who was
the Head of the British Division of Radio Moscow,had been an interpreter
for the Russians et the Brussels World Fair. He previously had been in
the United States with his father, who was with AMPORG in the late 1920's/
early 1930's. said that Belitskiy attended school in New York City

. With further reference to Mosby, Nnotea that there was a direct
relationship between Mosby, Koch (carl ¥ Eenry Koch, #50001 ) and Volkoff
(George Volkoff;” #152385 = SSD) — all of whom had been of interest with

reference to Belitskiy.

 

Others whom Mosby knew included Alexander. porkSee, #165652 ~ ssp,
to whom she was introduced by McKinney H, Russell 293853 - SSD, still
another who was of interest in connection with Belitskiy.

CI/SIG was advised in late 1958 regarding the above individuals and
informed that CI/OA was also interested in them. .

' According to information furnished by Fitzgerald Curtis Smith,
ALY6L7T8 - SSD, during a debriefing in June 1959, Boris Y. Belitskiy, whom
Smith knew in Moscow, was in great fear of being purged, "as was his
father, & Russian Jew, who had once lived in New York." According to
Snith, Belitskiy knew and trusted no U.S. citizens in Moscow other than
himself (Smith) and Aline Mosby, UPI correspondent in Moscow. Smith aaid
Belitskiy met Aline Mosby at the Brussels World Feir in the summer of 1958,
at the same time he mt Smith. Smith said he subsequently contacted
Belitskiy in Moscow in December 1958, through NBC Correspondent Irvine R.
Levine.

Another who knows, or has known, Aline Mosby is former Agency employee
George Winters, “55769. Winters stated during an interview in November/
December 1060, when discussing Americans in Moscow who lived beyond their
means, that newspaperman Harry Schapiro*was a very heavy loser at poker —~
to the extent that “one got the impression he was on the Soviet budget.”
Schapiro, he said, had a Russian wife who was more aggressive than he.
Winters added that newspaperwoman Aline Mosby was in Schapiro's office;
and commented that she "stuck mostly to the Foreign circuit rather than
the Embassy circuit." He said that she had been in the hospital on several
oecassions during the previous year, so that “one didn't see too much of her"!
and added that according to gossip one hospitalization was ocassioned by an
abortion.

Another newspaperwoman in Moscow, whom Winters mentioned, was Priscilla
Johnson, #'71589-DL. She has been mentioned in newspaper articles as one who
recalled having come in contact. with Lee Hervey Oswald in Moscow, where she
interviewed (or talked) with him. Her name, like Mosby's ,was listed in his
address book under her lest name only.

Mosby was born on 27 July 1922 in Missoula, Montene; and graduated
from the University of Montana in 1943. She was employed by United Press
in Seattle, Washington, from 1943 to 1945, and was Hollywood Correspondent
for UP from 1945 to 1957. According to the UP Bureau Manager at Los Angeles,
she resigned voluntarily in 1957 and her employment wes satisfactory. Ac-
eording to Confidential informant R-l, during an Agency investigation in the
fall of 1958, she was dropped by UP when she was subpoeaned in connection
with legal suits against Confidentiel Magazine, for which she had done re-
write work without the knowledge of UP. She went to the Brussels World Fair
os a stringer for the North American Newspaper Alliance. She was considered
loyal by her associates during the above period; but was described as "the
co-existence type who essociates with Russians" ("plays footsie with the
Russians"). No informant questioned her loyalty.

In January 1960, Mosby reportedly was introduced on the Dave Garroway
Show, "Today", as NBC News' Correspondent; but in a State Department dis~
patch of 12 December 1960, which listed "Western Correspondents in Moscow",
she was named as representing UPI.

According to HCUA records, Mosby did @ motion picture critic type
article for the Daily Worker in 1947; wrote an article for the Daily Worker
at Laguna Beach, California, in 1949; and contributed a column to the Daily
Worker on 23 November 1956. According to records of the Civil Service Com-
mission, the Daily Worker of 26 July 1957 and 29 August 1957 carried infor-
mation regarding her.
