Memorandum Mr. W, C, Sullivan.
to Mr. A..H, Belmont
RE: LEE HARVEY OSWALD

 

Absence of Payments to Oswald

Had any of our offices even made payments to him
under the SAC*s authority, these would have been shown in

; the.receipts and vouchers submitted by each office, These
| records have been checked and double checked and no such

Payment was ever made,

number used, past or present. The number 179 supposedly

assigned Oswald is currently used by the Dallas Office

for a criminal informant, Velma Yvgnne Graham, a Negro madam

who runs a house of. prostitution, Min New Orleans, where ‘Oswald

, Spent some time, the number 179 wa's-used by the New Orleans

| Office back in 1941 to designate an informant, Joseph A.
Partridge, who was reporting security information and who was
discontinued in 1944, As previously noted, once a number is
used in any capacity, whether to designate a security or a

iminal informant, it cannot be used by the field office again.

In Mexico, to which Oswald traveled just prior to the assassi-
nation of President Kennedy, our Legal Attache there currently

| has a security informant 179 who was so designated in 1960,

He is Ignacio Olivo, who furnishes information on the Mexican-

Russiay Institute of Cultural Exchange in Morelia, Michoacan,

Mexico U) So,

Procedural Steps Never Taken

| Furthermore, Oswald could not have been assigned such
a symbol number without a prior,.background investigation by any
‘field office considering him for development, Had any field
office considered developing him, it would have had to obtain
approval by the SOG. There is no record of any such request
by any field office and no record of any such approval,
