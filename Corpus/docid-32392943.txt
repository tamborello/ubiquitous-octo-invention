Action Required: See paragraph 1

1. Forwarded for Headquarters retention are 70 volumes
(5 packages) of the photographic take of LIONION from late
1961 through December 1968. Since the Station is trying to
reduce its volume of hard copy records, it is requested that
Headquarters retire these volumes to the Records Center so that
in case a need arises, they can be reviewed by Headquarters.
The Station suggests that a retention period of 10 years from
the date of information may be desirable. . :

2. The above volumes are being forwarded Headquarters
via the IURADIAL flight of 19 August 1969.
