CG 92-1684

PCI WALDEN advised on 4/20/67 that DAVID YARAS has -
only been observed twice at the apartment in the last three
months and the last time was approximately one and a half
months ago.

RONALD YARAS, the other son of DAVID YARAS, is now
operating Unique Import Trading, Ltd,, at 1644 North Honore,
Chicago, This was formerly operated under the name of M&E
Sales Company and at one time was run by MANNY GREENFIELD.

On 4/21/67, PCI MANNY GREENFIELD advised that DAVID
YARAS has not been seen for a couple of months in Chicago and
only occasionally comes here, The informant stated again that
to his knowledge DAVID YARAS has no direct connection with
Unique Import and that the operation is handled by RONALD YARAS,

On 3/23/67, BEN KAPLAN, 6521 North Sacramento, Chicago,
advised he has worked at M&E Sales for ten years and now works
for RONALD YARAS at Unique Import. KAPLAN said DAVID YARAS
has no voice in the company and it is run on a legitimate basis.
He said DAVID YARAS visits at the business occasionally, but
has not been seen for sone thbme, |

On 4/21/67, KAPLAN said he has not seen DAVID YARAS
in Chicago for several months.

On 4/20/67, PCI Mr, L.J, MATHIS, Credit Manager of
the Continental Plaza Hotel, 909 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago,
advised SA CARLTON H. WOLFARTH that DAVID YARAS does not reside
at the hotel and has no apartment leased, The informant checked
his records and showed a photo of YARAS to his security force
with negative results,

Chicago in its coverage has been unable to determine
the exact whereabouts of YARAS outside of the Chicago area
and has presumed he is in the Miami area when not in Chicago.

Chicago has no objection to be designated office of
origin in this investigation, but at the present time, Chicago
cannot assure more coverage than is already maintained due to
YARAS' infrequent visits to Chicago, There appears to be no
indication that YARAS will be in the Chicago area on a more
frequent msis than he has been in the past.
