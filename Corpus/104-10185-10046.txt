%. —._-Re the Station Comment at the end of the dispatch; The question eon -
cerning the extent of tracing of potential agents for this KUTUBE/ D purpose has
been fully discissed at Headquarters, and the following policy has beea eutablished:
Candidates will be traced ia selected U. S. files; tracing in foreign files will be |
permitted oaly when the foreign indices concerned can be traced perscnatly bya
KUBARK atafler who will be ia a position to certii, that the foreign service or
police dows not know wha wag traced. Tracing by a penetration agent is not ani-
lateral enough to fit this maxinroum sensitivity effort since there is no acceptable
guarantee that & recard of the tracing {s not left in foreign files. Theoretically,
tracing subject of OIRA 27542 in Staltan files would be desizable; practically, we
cannot take the slightest chance of exposing our.interest in Subjoct to a foreign
aorvice and will therefore have to forego the additional tracing. For your infor-
mation, our tracing at Headquarters consists of the following minimum: RL Ri
archives, Greenlist, KUSCDA files, Lalian Branch files {and other branches as
appropriate}.

   
 
    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    
    
 

    

3. Please handie any future traffic pursuant to OIRA-27542 in accordance - F
with paragraph 5, OIRW 18582. ‘The use of the RYBAT slug alone ain't what it
used to be.
