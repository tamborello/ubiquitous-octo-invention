MEMORANDUM FOR THE STANDING GROUP OF THE NATIONAL
; SECURITY COUNCIL

SUBJECT: Cuban Attacks on Reconnaissance Flights -- Contingency
‘ Plan (submitted 28 May 1963)

1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have reviewed this plan, and offer
the general and specific comments and recommendations set forth below.

2. General

a. The proposals in the plan are considered only a segment
of the spectrum of possible provocative measures that could be
taken to incite the Castro-Gommunist regime to take actions which
would justify U.S. reprisals aimed at the elimination of the Castro
regime. It is understood that other provocative measures may be
considered which would provide an equally just and credible frame -
work for overt military action on the part of the U.S. to achieve
the same end result. 2

b. It must be recognized as probable that there would be a

22 requirement for CINCLANT Op Plans 312 and 316 to insure the
2 i g elimination of the Castro-Communist regime.
He 3. Specific
oers a, Subparagraphs 2d, 4a, and 7b(1); the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Es £3 disagree with these provisions for medium altitude overflights.
a Eas They consider that the military feasibility of such flights is a
= &
g iu matter which should be evaluated at the time.

aod

Ps &
i | 2 b. Subparagraph 3a: while the Joint Chiefs of Staff agree
2 ee ° that response to Cuban provocation is the "most feasible’ means

of action, they would not rule out unilateral actions without
provocation should circumstances so indicate.

c, Subparagraph 4a: the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend
that this paragraph be revised to indicate timing, i.e., how soon
after the incident occurs the actions described in subparagraph 4a
are to be taken. (Comments 3a and 3f of this memorandum also apply.)

 

Lo TEEN SEE RS

d, Subparag raph 4c: the parenthetical phrase '(DEFCON 3
for SAC)" should be deleted, as all U.S. forces would be placed in:
appropriate states of readiness.

e. Subparagraphs 6b(5) and 6c(2); in connection with these
subparagraphs, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the paper
should be expanded to include consideration of the possibility of
building up in advance a potential for revolt within Guba. |

£, Subparagraph 6c(1): the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagree with —

the provisions for intensification of reconnaissance as a provocative
measure as contemplated in this subparagraph. In this connection,

: the exclusive use of reconnaissance flights to this end is not considered

: the optimum use of this resource. Other methods of provocation,
involving aerial (e.g., armed flights flown under the facade of
"yeconnaissance') and perhaps other operations, which do not unduly
place into jeopardy American lives and highly classified equipment,
should be considered. Reconnaissance should be intensified only if
such flights can be justified by operational requirements for military
intelligence. @

g. Subparagraphs 7b(1) and (2): the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider

that these subparagraphs should be clarified to indicate whether the
actions contemplated are intended to be taken before an incident occurs
or at the time the incident occurs. If the former, they believe that the
proposal should be reconsidered in light of the costs and disruptive
‘effects that would result, and that, in any event, the nature, timing,
and duration of the prepositioning envisaged by the proposal should

be indicated.

h. In order to avoid any implication that the consideration of
reconnaissance flights for other purposes connotes a reduced need
for their intelligence contribution, a statement should be made at ;
an appropriate point reemphasizing the requirement to conduct
aerial reconnaissance for the purpose of insuring an adequate flow
of information for intelligence purposes.

i. In view of the gravity of the matter, more detailed analysis
should be made of the question of U.S, -U.S. &.R. confrontations
likely to result from the proposal in Cuba and elsewhere, the impact
of possible Soviet reactions upon the time phasing proposed, the
possibility of escalation, and the capability of U.S. forces to cope
with simultaneous crises.

4. It is recommended that the Contingency Plan be revised in
accordance with the foregoing, and made available for further review
when revised.
