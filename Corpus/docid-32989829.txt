HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

    
   

Captioned. committee, by letter dated June 16, 1978, .
requested an interview with Special Agent D. Alan Reighley, III,
Allentown,,Pennsylvania, Resident Agency, Philadelphia Division,
i at a date to be later decided. The interview was subsequently
| scheduled at 11:00 a.m., on July 11, 1978, at the House Office
Building, Annex 2, Second and D Streets, S.W., Washington, D. C.

On July 11, 1978, SA Reighley was interviewed by
Staff Attorney Tom Sacco, House Select Committee on Assassinations
(HSCA), at the above address. Mr. Sacco advised he is in the
process of "tying up loose ends" in that portion of the Martin
Luther King assassination dealing with "extremist groups". All
of his questioning concerned activities of the Klan. and Minutemen
groups in the Reading, Pennsylvania, area during the period of
August, 1867, through April, 1968, when Dr. King was assassinated.
SA Reighley was able to give Mr. Sacco a fairly detailed account
of the general activities of these groups during the pertinent
period.

During the above interview, Mr. Saeco advised that
he is in receipt of certain- "allegations" from certain sources
regarding the relationship between the FBI and Klan and
Minutemen groups in the Philadelphia FBI territory, and, more
specifically, the Reading area. The "allegations" being that the
FBI "on a regular basis" furnished right wing extremist groups
with intelligence information for their use against Dr. King.
He stated he has specific reference to an allegation that the FBI
in the Reading area furnished extremist groups with photographs
of Dr. King in attendance at a meeting with "communists" which j.
the extremist groups used to try to discredit Dr. King. :

House Select Committee on Assassinations

In answer to the above "allegation", SA Reighley
emphatically denied that the FBI in the Reading area had ever
engaged in such activity during his assignment there, nor
had he ever received any information that this had been done
in the FBI elsewhere.

Mr. Saceo stated that the above "allegations" came
from Roy Frankhouser (former Grand Dragon of the.United Klans
of America for Pennsylvania and activitist with numerous white
hate groups including the Minuteman); and that he had also received
the same information from “other sources". He later admitted
that his investigation indicates that the information received
from "other sources" emanated from Frankhouser. Mr. Sacco then
asked numerous questions about Frankhouser and his background
and SA Reighley answered these questions in detail. He also
asked questions regarding the relationship between Frankhouser
and FBI Agents in the Philadelphia Division. He made specific
reference to retired SAs William E. Davis and Frank Kauffman,
formerly of the Reading Resident Agency; and retired Assistant
Director Joe Jameson, former Special Agent in Charge of the
Philadelphia Division. SA Reighley stated that his relationship
with Frankhouser had always. been an "investigator-subject"
relationship and that to the best of His knowledge, this was the
same relationship that Davis and Kauffman had with Fraiikhouser.
SA Reighley also advised Mr. Sacco that he has no information at
all as to whether or not Frankhouser had any relationship
whatsoever with Special Agent in Charge Jameson but that it is
highly unlikely that Frankhouser had ever even met Mr. Jameson.

Mn. Sacco stated that SA Reighley had sufficiently
covered the area in which he is interested and he sees no
necessity to call anyone else from the FBI concerning this
particular matter. He-indicated that he had certainly questioned
the reliability of the source of the allegations, namely,

..Frankhouser; however, his main concern was leaving the "allegations"

unanswered. SA Reighley thanked Mr. Sacco for the opportunity
to answer the "allegations" and offered to be of any future
assistance in this regard.
