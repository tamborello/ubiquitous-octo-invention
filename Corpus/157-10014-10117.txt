Areas of Inquiry for Goodwin
i

-- What, if anything, does Goodwin remember of the August
10, 1962, meeting of the Special. Group which he attended?

 

-- Is this meeting different than the meeting he refers to _
in his initial interview where McNamara broached the sub-
ject of assassinating Castro? Or has he simply confused
them and are they one and the same?

-- How does he explain McCone's recollection of having given
an oration on the immorality of assassinating Castro when
it was brought up at the August 10 meeting?

 

-- Was McNamara the person who|brought up the subject at
that meeting? :

-- What discussion, if any, followed?

assassinating Castro. After the Bay of
Pigs, a Cuba Task Force was established,
first chaired by Paul Nitze and then by
Goodwin in his capacity as White House
Staff Officer. Ati a.meeting of the Task
Force, held at the State Department,
McNamara suggested "getting rid of Castro",
someone from the CIA, perhaps Bissell,
then asked if McNamara meant "Executive |
Action". McNamara’ responded that he did
and stressed his interest in the idea.
However, Goodwin did not bring the topic
up later in the. meeting after McNamara
left. (See interview infra.)

 

 

 

C. The Goodwin Documents
The documents which Mr. Goodwin has furnished

the Committee are of no startling significance. One docu-
{ ° . .

ment, the May 2, 1961, memorandum from Bissell to Goodwin,

 

is noteworthy because it does not advise him of the Roselli
. connection or the efforts to assassinate Castro. Bissell
notes, "T have not attempted to. provide you with much
detail." A May 24, 1961, Memorandum of Conversation with
Bissell by Goodwin does not mention any reference by Bissell

to actions against Castro on the assassination front. An

 

Arthur Schlesinger memorandum of June 30, 1961, to the

President discusses the need for revamping of the "intelli-

gence set-up" of the United States... In a footnote in that :

memorandum, Schlesinger notes that the CIA is not ‘able to -
t

control its operatives once they are in the field and of

 

the attendant dangers this poses. (See page 6 of the memo. )

 

 

 

HW 50955 -Docld:32423505 Page 8.

 

 
noted that McCone never nade any oration upon the. immorality

 

Fr ; .
of assassinating Castro. He remembered the August 10 meet-

 

ing and said that "assassination was not shot down". When

pressed for details at this point, and after being shown

 

the Lansdale (8/13/62) and Harvey (8/14/62) memoranda, he

. |
said he wanted to think about the meeting. before he made

 

any more statements about who Said and did what. He noted, nn
. aa . .
however, that in 1966 while injPeru with Robert Kennedy that
. . ni .
Kennedy, in a fleeting retort to a series of questions

about U. S. assassination attempts against Castro, said
t .

 

"Tell him (the interpreter) I gaved his (Castro's) life."

. At the conclusion of!the interview he turned over
to the Committee various documents related to Cuba which he
had found in his personal papers. Those are apperided to.

this summary.

 

_B. Goodwin Interview of May 27, 1975

During the course of ,this earlier interview,
Goodwin alluded to the Cuba Task Force. According to the i
Committee notes of that interview, the discussion went as

follows: .
In general, Goodwin had not heard much
specific talk of assassination, although
it would not have/surprised him if it had
gone on. He mentioned one specific in-
stance in which he had heard talk of

during the conversation between President Kennedy and Tad

 

Szulc concerning the question of assassinating Castro. goo
(See Szulc's testimony infra.) | He spoke with ‘the President
after that conversation and remembers JFK saying about

assassination: "We can't get into that -- we'll all be
targets.” He noted’ that Bissell never mentioned anything
