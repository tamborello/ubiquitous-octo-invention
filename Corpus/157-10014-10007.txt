problem of trying to clean out the combination of Communist
Party members, probably Soviet intelligence, and also known
homosexuals which also were in the counter-intelligence side.

So, I think that what the record does not reflect is that

there were very strong counter-intelligence stressed by the
\

very people who, in a sense, played a part in the originating

ef the entire program.

_And I find that conflict with,as I say, DiSilva or Doran,
Dawa burn d 7
Dan Doran, or he stated or made some comment that it should
not be a -- it was not for counter-intelliyence purposes, that
it was entirely misleading.

And in the penetration part of it, of the problems con-
fronting security, Mr. Horton had much to do with that as well
as Mr. O'Neal. In other words, there was a very firm
relationship going back into all of the other kinds of cases.

Mr. Wallach. I'm not entirely sure I understand, when
you talk about the Office of Security at that time probably
continually being occupied with penetration, how that would
affect their handling the project. Are you talking strictly
about manpower, because it is my understanding that project
still took up a heck of a lot of time for the Office of
Security in terms of manpower.

are you talking about manpower down at Headquarters?

Mr. Angleton. No. I only saw and noticed the effect that

in one of Herman's memos which he drafted, he talked about the

freeze in Security, the fact that Security were hamstrung for
personnel, etc, and starting out in 'S5, the staff having been
pulled together in '54, we did have a lot of slots and we had
a lot of latitude,,that it would be very natural in terms of
the associations for someone to put up to the staff for taking
away the project.

Mr. Wallach. This might: be kind ofa hypothetical that I'm
going to pose, but if you really don't feel that you can give an
answer on it, just let me know.

For example, if Security had continued with the project,
would they have had the expertise to really do anything with it

besides really straight, positive intelligence? I think you may;

 

have suggested that, that there was sort of a natural gravitatio
to CI staff once it developed,
Mr. Angleton. Yes, I think there was a natural gravitation

I think the Security's interest,, they would have been able to

handle, but it would have been a very small slice of the project!

{
In other words, theirs would have only been personnel, and then, ;

in correspondence within Agency people, and Soviet units and
so on.

Mr. Wallach. JI’ would like at this time, Mr. Angleton, to
show you a document that I will just ask’ the Reporter to subse-
quently mark as Angleton Exhibit 1 for identification of
this date. It is --,I am not actually sure whether it is

there were a number of matters involved here. I think one of
them was that security was undergoing some kind of freeze.
Second, I believe the Division wanted out. I think there were
a combination of factors which led to the feeling on the part
of many that the program would be discontinued for lack of
funding and personnel. The other point is that Mr. Horton
had very close relationships with the Office of Security and

I assume they went to him on it because even though there is
memorandum by DiSilva to the effect that the project was not
to be used for counterintelligence purposes, that is very
unrealistic, because Mr. Timm, who put up the project, was
himself a counterintelligence officer. ie had been formerly
FBI, and then he was OSS counterintelligence during the war,
in fact his whole career was in a professional sense in counter-
intelligence. And I dontt feel that the thrust of it was
entirely positive intelligence in his mind.

I knew him extremely well.

Further, there was, which I have not seen reflected in
the papers I have read, the security was very much involved
operationally in terms of penetration of the Agency in
security cases, and this goes back to the post-OSs period,
at least after the war when I was abroad, and there were a lot
of hearings on penetration of OSS, and this was supported by
some very highly sensitive documentation, Soviet in nature, to

the extent of penetration and security were charged with this

TESTIMONY OF JAMES ANGLETON == Resumed

Mr. Angleton. I don't know the date, but I assume that I
learned of it through Herman Norton, who was my Deputy in 1954.

Mr. Wallach. At that time it was being run by the Office
of Security, is that correct?

Mr. Angleton. That's right.

Mr. Wallach, Did there come a point in time when the
operation was taken over, at least the substantive parts of the

Operations as compared to the procedural and mechanical aspects

 

of gathering together and intercepting the mail, that this was
oT
taken over by the CIA, atafe?
Mr. Angleton. That's right.
Mr. Wallach. When was that, sir?
Mr. Angleton. Well, there is a chrono on this entire

thing.. I think the best chrono is this report, if I can find

it in the Rockefeller Commission. '55, I believe, at the time.

 

Mr. Wallach. Is the document you are looking at now the

| attachment, prepared for the Rockefeller Commission and submitted

the day you testified there?
Mr. Angleton. That's xvight.
The time was 1955,
Mr. Wallach. Given that approximate time, Mr. Angleton,

ol
do you recall how the decision was reached that CIA.staff would

take over the project?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I think there was a question, I think

TOP SECRET

 

 
 

‘Mr. Wallach. Mr. Angleton, on behalf of the Committee,
let me express our appreciation on the record for your coming
back again. As you recall, I was present for a portion of the
testimony that you gave to Mr. Johnson on the Houston Plan, and
I still think for this session that the oath that was applied
at that time would still pertain.

Do you understand that you are still under oath?
Mr. Angleton. I don't know. You know the regulations,

Mr. Wallach. In any event, you at that time were also

 

given then, you were advised of your rights to counsel, etc.
. }
I take it, once again, by the fact that you have come without

counsel, that you have taken to waive that right.

Is that right?

Mr. Angleton. That's right.

Mr. Wallach, The subject matter that we'll be discussing
here today primarily focuses upon the New York Mail intercept
! program that was run by the CIA for approximately 20 years,

I realize you've already given some testimony on this,
both for the record, for the Commission, and briefly touched upon
it as a sidelight'to Mr. Johnston's examination, and I will try as
best I can not to be repetitive. I, of course, have access
to the Rockefeller material and have read it, and we will try

again not to cover the same ground except insofar as I would Like

I also have some dccumenta here I would like to show you
in varying degrees that will have to be read, and I think we can
take them one at a time, and you will be given an adequate chancd
to read them, and should we reach a determination it is necessary
to do so, the minute there are any questions on them, wa can
do that for each document.

Mr. Angleton, do you recall when you became aware that.therd

was:a mail intercept project in New York City?
