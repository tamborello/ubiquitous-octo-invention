' . . Pans

It is. recommended that this surveillance be maintained for” an’, : -
additional period of ninety days and such will be done UACB, - =!
There can be no. doubt that the general quality ‘and quantity of — ‘
information obtained through’ this source. has’. greatly decreased | my
since its peak three years ago.. However, this source does continue
to be active to Some extent as can be ‘seen through the information ||
set out under number 9. In addition, attention is drawn to thes OR
‘fact that no expense'is involved in monitoring this source due to. \
the fact that the same employees who monitor other surveillances a
on the Same.subject conveniently and with only. nominal‘ additional
effort monitor this source. In addition, it should be‘ clearly i
understood that there does not, appear to be any- particular risk,
involving the security of this source, the only risk being that .
which would be inherent’ an making an entry to retrieve the
N microphone. rn
