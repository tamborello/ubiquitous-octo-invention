WEEKLY SUMMARY

MM 440-C advised that RUBY STRAUSS, once connected
with the big bookmakers in the Miami area, is no longer gambling
or bookmaking. He stated STRAUSS has remarried a stable woman
and is employed by the Gulf American Land Corporation as a real
estate salesman.

MM 743-C was told that MELVIN RICHARDS, Mayor of Miami
Beach, and BERNARD FRANK, Miami Beach City Councilman, will make
a "big pitch" to establish a separate county for Miami Beach,
with the ultimate pitch" for legalized gambling in the proposed
new county.

MM 883-C-TE reported the local Cuban bolita operators
have come up with a new system of selecting the winning bolita
numbers on a daily basis, The new method involves the use of
the numbers of the winning dogs at the local dog tracks and thus
the bettors can verify the winning numbers by reading local
newspapers, He stated the local Latin Americans and colored
individuals are switching to this type of bolita or numbers game,
as they feel this method protects them from fixed drawings, He
pointed out that every day except Sunday, bettors can bet on the
three numbers in the hundreds, three numbers in the tens and three
parlays on all local dog races. He cited for example that in each
dog race there is a win, place and show and if #4 dog won, #1 dog:
placed and #3 dog showed, the above numbers would become the

 

numerical number 413. ie. -F_. 2
