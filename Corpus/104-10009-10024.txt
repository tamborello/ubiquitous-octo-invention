ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

1. A Paris correspondent of Newsweek, Ray Sokolov, told RODIGAST he had the
assignment from his home office to, to track down the manuscript of the Manchester
book on Kennedy's assassination. Hgyfioped that it was now in the hands of a French
publisher for translation, and that would be able to get hold of it at least
temporarily, because Newsweek understands that Jacqueline Kennedy was withdrawing
the book, at least temporarily, perhaps to insist on certain cuts.

2. RODIGAST checked locally and learned that the book's French rights had been
sold by a London literary agent,/Gornall of Intercontinental Literary Agency (phone
COVent Garden 3181), jointly to\two French publishers, Editions Robert Laffont and
Editions Stock, who were going publish it. But they do not have a text, and only
one person, Jean Rosenthal of itdions Laffont, has had a significant amount of text
in his hands. Andre Bay of Editions Stock said he felt that the Kennedy family was
going to withdraw the book for serious cuts for political reasons.

3. Bay's wife works for tndithons Arthaud, which will soon publish Mark Lane's
Rush to Judgment. Lane will be in Paris (probably very shortly) to appear on a
long French television program dealing with the Kennedy assassination, The French
publisher thinks Lane's book (which describes the 14 persons who had died violently
since the assassination, all of whom were key witnesses) is quite factual. Lane is
also reportedly involved in the Bertrand Russell mock trial, but the French publisher
does not think the television appearance will deal with this.
