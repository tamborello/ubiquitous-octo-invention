Re: FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

97-4196

our aim is to produce additional witnesses who can testify

as to the Cuban Government's involvement with the FPCC,

her position as to testifying, openly or otherwise, now or

in the future, should be determined. It is pointed out that
testimony by her that the Cuban Government retained Taber to
start a pro-Cuban group in New York City and that an official

of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations actually hired

Taber to do so could conceivably: be used as basis for prosecutive
action against Taber and/or the FPCC when added to the previous
testimony of Buch.

The Bureau feels very strongly concerning potential
of Cobb's interview. However, if she positively refuses ;
to cooperate with your office and you are wi j to accomplish
this satisfactorily, it is possible fthat Ci Tapeatia her

s

along: the above lines, It is not believed hat Cl

interview as thoroughly as your office~and a request

Ghat CTA dle it would be made only as a last resort. Cobb
e

should contacted as expeditiously as possible.
