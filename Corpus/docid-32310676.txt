‘Agent LEMAN L, STAFFORD, Jr. that ENRIQUE LLACA, Jr.,

of dissidents in Brigade 2506 after their return from
imprisonment in Cuba, He stated LLACA has very few
followers and that he has heard little or nothing con-
cerning his organization during the recent past, and
in fact, felt it had been dissolved,

; On August 5, 1963, MM 492-S advised he had
heard of captioned organization, that several months
ago they sponsered several radio programs, but had
become defunct and no longer transmitted these anti-
CASTRO broadcasts. He said he had learned there were
possibly only 10 or 15 individuals supporting ENRIQUE
LLACA, Jr. and he is not considered an tmportant figure
whatever in anti-CASTRO Gircles..
