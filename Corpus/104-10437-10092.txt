Gaerious, US Secufity, breach which involved a Mrs. Lillian BAXTER of

Calcutta, India who also was known to CORE. Sirs. BAXTER who was
believed to be an American with Indian citizenship, had formerly been

- married to an Anglo-Indian planter in India and was said te have become

@ prostitute and in 1951 to have been kept by a wealthy Marwari... She
was believed to be controlled by Indian Intelligence and it was thought
that she might be an agent for any of several governments including

’ England and Russia. She was an associate of David Gilmore BALDWIN
- and was suspected of stealing security documents from him.

There ia insufficient informatian regarding Jesse CORE, Clay
SHA ‘V's associate, to positively identify him us BALD ‘VIN's friend,
Jesse R. CORE, but it seems quite probable that they are the same.
BALDWIN is from New Orleans and it would appear that his friend CONT
is aleo, in ag much as he geerrs in all probability to be the husband of

a Mrs. Jess CORE. nee: Lucy tugsles, who as of 1956 was said to be
married to a man in the State Department and to be somewhere overseas,
and as of 1957 was said to reside in New Orleans, Louisiama.. This
