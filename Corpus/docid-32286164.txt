The instant report is divided into three sections.
The first is a series of excernts taken from the file
reviewing ALEX's rise to power. This was done with the
purpose of attempting to identify a fresh approach on this
case. The second traces ALEM's current activities. The
third section provides a thumbnail sketch of ALEX's
reported employer, Apex Amusement, Deluxe Cigarettes, and
Ajax Phonographic. Virtually all of ALFX's reported
income has been from this source. One again, it is
speculated that if ALEX is to be brought to justice, that
it will be necessary to attack him through this source.
So long as this corporation insulates him from his
illeqal activities/income, it will be improhable to
develop a prosecutable case. Chicago, therefore, intends
to explore more the function and activities of the cor-
poration as a means of reading ALEX.
