8, (S) There is a group of officers within the Cuban Officers Training
Program at LAFB who contemplates submitting their resignations if the United
States has not done anything for the freedom of Cuba by December 1963, Many offi~
cers have indicated their desire to resign in order to join Manuel Artime who is
supposedly organizing a training camp in Nicaragua, Artime has some contacts
among the officers undergoing training at LAFB, and for a long time, these officers
have been undermining the present training program by spreading dissension among
their fellow officers. These men also have developed.a recruiting campaign to
supply Artime with qualified leaders for the Nicaraguan camp, Artime's recruiters
at LAFB are: Diego Emiliano Borges-Torres, 2d Lt, C2 312 431; Ladislao George.

private enterprises, The Somoza regime in Nicaragua has also promised assistance

“to Artime in the forthcoming operations against Communist Cuba. In early August

4. {C) Source has heard of the existence of a group of officers in the Cuban
Officer Training Program who are considering resigning from the Program in the near
future. At LAFB, there are a number who are waiting for the termination of their
English course to resign, while others plan to turn in their resignation after
arriving at a new station, One of them is Rene F. Gomez-Fipgueroa, 2d Lt, C2 312.
397, Source believes that the reason for their leaving is that they plan to trans-
fer to Nicaragua, or another overseas base, in order to continue their fight against
Communist Cuba, This group is in contact with Pedro Acebo-Rodriguez “and Antonio ,
Iglesias-Pons, both of whom resigned from the Cuban Training Program upon completion
of the Course at Fort Benning and who are in Nicaragua organizing anti-Castro regime
activities, (This group’ consists mainly of men who fought in the Bay of Pigs in-
vasion of Cuba)

S. (8S) There is a group within the Cuban Officer Training Program presently
undergoing training at LAFB who are planning to submit their resignations upon
completion of additional courses. One of these individuals is Ladislao George
Fernandez-Martinez, 2d Lt, C2 312 392, The motive for presenting their resignations
is to go to Nicaragua and organize an attempt to overthrow Castro. This group is
in contact through correspondence with Pedro Acebo-Rodriguez“and Antonio Eugenio
Igiesias~Pons,/both of whom resigned the course while at Fort Benning in August
1963, Fernandez is expecting te hear from Manolo Artime“in order to submit his
resignation in late November and go to Nicaragua. Artime revealed to Fernandez
details about his conference with Charles de Gaulle of France and Conrad Adenauer
of Germany, Artime showed documents and pictures to Fernandez corroborating his
conferences with de Gaulle and Adenauer, Artime told Fernandez that de Gaulle and
Adenauer have promised him help to establish a camp in Nicaragua for the purpose
of taking over Cuba. Such help should start to be received by Artime after Novem-
ber 1963, Alberto Maleo Munia-Bozj 2d Lt, C2 312 400, another officer who re~-
signed from the program in August 1953 and now residing in Miami, wrote a letter
to Federico Garcia-Geli, 24 Lt, C2 312 393, LAFB, explaining his reasons for

resigning the program and requesting that the letter be circulated among the fel-
low officers of the class at LAFB, The letter said that he (Muina) left the
course because many of the men who had applied for the various schools, such es
the Intelligence and the Armored Schools, were still at Fort Benning wasting time
Also, Muina had applied for a demolition course and after he was placed on orders
to go to the course, the orders were cancelled. Muina did not like this and de-
‘cided to get out. Source, who knows Muina well, is certain that Muina is working
for or with Artime also. Muina has indicated repeatedly to his friends and to
the officers undergoing the nrogram that Cuba will not gain its liberty with the
assistance of the United States, but needs to look for help from another country.
Muina believes that the United States has decided to apply the principle of co-
existence towards Cuba. Muina also has stated that the United States Government
lacks the ability to understand the Latin American problems, and that he is going
to join Artime.

plating resignation, exact reasons unknown, Of the officers who have resigned
with the intention of joining a group to defeat Castro, Source remembers Antonio
Iglesias~Pons“who resigned recently, Miranda-Hernandez has heard that Iglesias
is recruiting people in Miami to be taken to a camp in Nicaragua which is operated
by Manolo Artime, Pedro Acebo-Rodriguee” and Luis de Jesus Sierra-Lopez, 2d Lt,

7. (S). Diego Emiliano Borges-Torres, 2d Lt, C2 312 451, is attempting to
find out if the ultimate purpose of the Cuban Officer Tratming-?rogram is identical
to the program which is controlled by Mamel Artime to train people in Nicaragua,
Upon obtaining this information, Borges-Torres is going to inform Source. If the
plan is the same, everyone in the program will immediately go to Nicaragua because
in Nicaragua the fight against Castro is more imminent, Help has been offered to
Artime by Somoza of Nicaragua and by de Gaulle of France, who apparently has
offered the Isle of Martinique for the operations against Castro. Manuel Artime
visited Columbus, Georgia, a few months ago and spoke to many Cuban officers and
tried to recruit them as instructors to go to the camp in Nicaragua, Source was
not present at any of the meetings with Artime,
