1. YForvardea under separate cover is a clipping frou the 20 March edition
of Bl Pais which records the adhesion of a nucber of democratic student
orgenizetions to the stand taken by subject during his recent visit to Montevideo.
Also qvoted are excerp*s from a speech given by the executive secretary of a
staticn-influenced nationvide student organization. .

2. The apparently spontaneous nature of such declarations ie having a
cumulative effect on broad segments of the Ursguayan pudlic. Furthermore,

such statexents appear “to be having a demoralizing effect upon the Commmist .
Party of Uruguay (FCU) es evidenced by its frenzied efforts to hold dexonstrations
in the Urvguayan interior and as confirmed by penetration agents and the ‘shrill
demmeiation of these student groups by the PO daily, Bl Popular.
