ordered by her doctors and an operation may be necessary in early 1964.

It is therefore unlikely that she will bé able to work during the coming
project year. Station does not plan to request cancellation of her operational
clearance at this time, but has not included salary payments to her in the
estimated costs of the project for the coning year.

 

The unusual salary increase reflected for LIHMPTY-19 in the "Project Costs"
(below) sactionfor the coming year is due to this agent's new duties of LIF=AT
processing in addition to her old duties as translator. Agent's OA vas emended
for this use on 2 January 1963. '

i

The comments made concerning the project's effectiveness in the Project
Renewal of 1960 (HMMA 15979) remain valid. Indeed the Station's need for the
type of services provided by the assota of this project are at least as great
today as they were when those coments were originally forwarded.

III. EFFECTIVENESS

IV. PROBLEMS 7

There are presently no know major, problems facing the operation which tould
affect either the security or the effectiveness of this operation. The security
problen facing the LICALLA portion of the operation and described in HittA-15979
and subsequent renewal. requests has been resolved by the Cuban Government's release
of three KURIOT personnel earlier this year. As was noted previously, one of
this group hal knowledge of the LICALLA. operation.

Both SCANTLING and GERENDS took tha LCFLUTTER during! the month of October
1963. No security problems were revealed by this test.
!

Vv. PLANS i
Tne Station considers that tne project is operating at its optimum size and
does not plan to expand it during the coming year. Efforts will be continued to
refine and better utilize the existing project organization and to ixprove the
compartmentation and security of the project.

VI. COSTS i

’ a. Support of the sensitive AMROD operation, in which Reymond H.
GERENDE also played a vital role, was of singular importance to
the success of the operation. SCANTLING's many fields of op-
erational experience were drawn on fully and he thereoy provided

_ & unique contribution to the operation. Without the assistance
of SCANTLING and GERENDE with thelr unique qualifications » this
operation would have been difficult in the extreme if indeed at

¢e. SCANTLING is used as the alternate contactin a sensitive LAURICLE
project. This is for the purpose of minimizing the danger of the
pereon agent in this project baing recosnizei as being in contact
with an obvious PRPRIME citizen. SCANTLING's contribution to this
operation has been noteworthy both from the standpoint of security
and agent handling. ,

da. SCANTLING continued to conduct numerous pretext ani neighbornosd
investigations. As in the past mony of these investigations were
in relation to hishly sensitive cases,

L, Although SCANTLING® 3 LIEMPTY project objectives can not be conpleseiy
fulfilled, it is the Stetion's opinion tinat SCAMTLING continues to m2ke valuable
chirlbutions to the objectives of the project and to other Station activities. |
BQNTLING's production, measured against mometary o:spenditure, case of. Picar tine
anl other intangibles factors, unquestionably justifies his continuing as an

2. "To collect operational infornavion and identify operational leads

ied by GERSHDE, is still tho major contributor to this objective.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations including the
renting of hotel reoms and safe apartments, renting and servicing offpost ofrice
boxes, and conducting counter-surveillmces." GERENDE's contribution to the ~
AyROD operation was noted in parazraph I.A.3.a. above, GiRENDE's conorehensive
area knowledge and personal overational capabilities enable him to make a ,
valuable contribution in such operations as AMHOD and also enable him to procure
the most desireable safe sites in support of the Station's operations. The
vroject's assets, particularly GERENDES ani LIEMPTY-10, presently provide 20
post office box mail drops for use of Mexico City Station and other Stations.
Although it is planned to reduce this namber considerably during the naxt year,
(since other Station assets now can provide a number of live accomnodation
addresses), a number of post office box3s will be retained for use in future
oserations.

4. The quality and quantity of opsrational information produced by the
pyhotosrephic bases and other activities under GERYNDE's control and supervision
is considered by the Station worthwhile and in some cases unique. It is con-
cluded, therefore, that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project shold be continued.

C. Relationshin to the Related Mission Directive

As noted in the examples given above, Project LIEMPTY has providei valuable
support to many Station operetions and chereby has been « contributing factor to
the fulfillment of the Releted Mission objectives of the Station. The project
has not produced any positive intelligence nor is it intended to do so. The
project's sole purpose is to provide a mecnanism for tiie development of opera-
tional information.

IZ. CHANGES :

I. CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION RELATED THERETO

 

A, Oliver G. SCANILING Segment (in relation to Project objectives.)

1. "fo collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK personnel
and vhysical facilities." SCANTLING has continued to provide worthwntle in-
Tormation in support of this objective. 1 (See previous project review forwarded
by HMMA-20052 of 18 October 1962.) Duri.g the past year SCANILING was used to
follow up leads produced by both LIFEAT and LIENVOY in support of this objective.
In particular SCANTLING provided, in biueprint detatl » casing reports on the
hones of two Soviet intelligence officers who are targets for Station technical
operations, . {

. t
SCANTLING also is used te aid the Station in maintaining current records
of the residences of Soviet perscmmel living in Mexico. This is accomplished by
SCANTLING's followup of LIENVOY Leads which indicate Soviet interest in renting
specific properties. : .

 
 

2. “Po colle che: B i on pertaining to other targets of op-
portunity, ‘TERE monGusEniegn roe, mand personnel of intelligence interest
operating in " LING has proved successful in providing information

on other Station targets:

a. SCANTLING ovtained information on AmMIQUELET-2, a suspect Soviet
support agmt vhich was ths basis of further Stetion overations
ageinst this tarzat. . '

  
  
 

b. SCANTLING provided a casing of the forner ¥ : a
Office against which the Station had planned a technical operation.
However, this site was evacuated py the taryet mission befcrte
plany were completed for this attempt.

c. SCANTLING has conducted detailed investigations in various ceses
involving possible agents or contacts of hostile intelligence ser-
viees. These cases were of prime concern to Station Maxico but
erequently were undertaken at the request of Headquarters ov other
Stations. ° : .

,

3. "To provide support to other Station operations as may be requested by
the Statioa officsrs concerned." In the past SCANTLI2G's activities. in this are
