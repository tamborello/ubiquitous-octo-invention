; The disturbed political situation in'Cuba and the resulting

decrease in tourism has had a severe affect in recent months on the

gambling casinos in Havana. Most. of the casinos are barely breaking

even. It is apparent, however, that American gamblers continue to
.,have an optimistic long-range view concerning the eventual. success i
“of gambling casinos in Cuba. In récent months on. the occasions when ~
; -gamblers have sold interests in casinos, there has apparently, been
¢i!“ia number of other gamblers interested in buying those interests.
Gon addition, the Legat, Havana, continues to receive information \

indicating that other gamblers in the United States are planning

to invest in and construct more casinos in Cuba as soon as the
’ political situation stabilizes, . -
