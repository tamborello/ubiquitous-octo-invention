city. councilmen have been "owned" by the MANNARINOs since. their

" election approximately eight years ago. At one time, JOSEPH MEROLA,

at the instructions of KELLY MANNARINO,.."wired" the New Kensington
City Council. Chambers so that tape recordings of the proceedings
could be made. ; ; :

’ Chief JOHN BORDINARO, New Kensington, Pa., Police Department, is

the personal selection for that job of KELLY MANNARINO.

“It-is noted that Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK of New Kensington was

defeated in the primary elections of May, 1961, and will not--be : \
a candidate for re-election in the general elections of November,

1961. ;

F, PENDING PROSECUTIVE ACTION

It is noted that it ‘has been reported previously that SAMUEL :
MANNARINO has been under indictment in the United States District
Court, Chicago, Illinois, since 1959 on‘a charge of aiding and

‘abetting in the use of a wire or radio communication in a scheme

to defraud a Swiss bank, in connection with the pledging of some
of the Canadian Government bonds which had been stolen from a
bank in Brockville, Ontario, Canada, in October, 1958.

On October 17, 1961, SAMUEL MANNARINO appeared before the United
States District Court, Chicago, Illinois, in order that trial date.
on the above charge might be set. However, the United States ;
District Court ruled that they would take no action as regards
setting of trial date until other defendants, including NORMAN
ROTHMAN, currently incarcerated at the Federal Penitentiary .in
Atlanta, Georgia, could be brought before the court personally.
Appearance of the defendants was rescheduled for October 31, 1961,
at which time the United States District Court would set trial date.
