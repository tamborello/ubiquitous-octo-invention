Re: Carlos Marcello

'

NOTE: Former WF 1633-C-—-TE was in recent personal contact with
Carlos Marcello, a leading hoodlum and racketeer in Louisiana.
Marcello related he had obtained a news photo showing him
carrying his raincoat on the arm he allegedly used in an
attempted assault on a Bureau Agent. WF 1633-C-TE later viewed
this photo in possession of Marcello's attorney who also stated
he had found an error in the impanelling of the Federal Grand
Jury which indicted Marcello. New Orleans is being instructed
to discreetly attempt to locate copies of news photos taken of
‘Marcello at the time of the attempted assault. It is noted that
Marcello was re-indicted on this charge by a new grand jury on
6/1/67 because of the possibility that the original grand jury
which indicted him 10/7/66 was improperly impaneled. It is not
clear which grand jury WF 1633-C-TE refers to.
