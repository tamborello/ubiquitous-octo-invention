States for his training camp located either in the Deminican
Republic or the Bahamas. It was unknewn hew he left the.
United States, who might have gone with him, or what he
took. His followers figured that he tock his military
equipment with him when he left and this equipment would

be shipped to his military training camp.

PATRIA is a Spanish language paper published
weekly in Miami, Florida.

On September 11, 1964, PATRIA contained an article

stating that the MDC iss ued a lengthy document accusing

. American agencies of being led by exile movements that are
split up and divided. The MDC claimed the United States

‘ government artificially creates leaders for the Cuban

.@dile movements, persecutes independent Cuban exile organ-
izations, and interferes in Cuban exile affairs. The MDC
uses the term "check-eaters" to refer to those persons cr
organizations which have received financial aid or backing
from the United States government.

 

MM T+2, another government agency which conducts
intelligence investigations, on September 30, 1964 advised
as follows:

: -A Cuban exile with excellent contacts in the
Antillean Marine Shipping Corporation, on September 15,
1964, reported that BATISTA epcke with officials cf the
Antillean Marine Corporaticn about the unloading from the
M.V. TITAN in the Deminican Republic of. one 23! Viking
class boat, equipped with twin Mercruiser engines, and a
radio telephone.

MOVIMIENTO DEMOCRATA CRISTIANO (MDC)
As of August 13, 1964, BATISTA did not leave

the United States for his military training camp, or the
Dominican Republic. He planned to leave cn August 13th

 

but canceled his plans for some unknown reascn.

The MDC previously maintained a clandestine
radio at its military headquarters, 837 S.W. 28th

“Avenue, Miami. This clandestine radio was recently re-

moved and reportedly returned to its cwner.

On August 17, 1964, ANGEL A and CESAR GARCIA,
two members of the military section of the MDC, went to
Key West, Florida. The purpose of the trip was to try
to locate a commercial shrimp boat to buy for the MDC.

’ BATISTA feels that if the organization had a commercial

fishing boat, money could be earned to support the or-
ganization's revolutionary activities.

At the MDC military headquarters, self-study
courses in military training and theory are being given.
These courses do not deal with the actual firing of ~
weapons or the use of detonators or explosives.

During the middle of August, 1964, BATISTA was
studying a number of detail maps of Cuba. Some of these
maps bear the stamp "For official U.S. Government use
only."' These waps were obtained by BATISTA from ROBERT —
KO°BROWN, ah American adventurer, part time writer,

former University of Colorado student and U.S. Army

Reserve Captain. BATISTA set up a copying camera on a
tripod, photographed these maps and is in the process
of making a number of copies. The maps do not appear to

be classified and are regular military type maps used by
the United States Amy.

On August 24, 1964, BATISTA stated he would

‘ now concentrate on raising funds for the MDC. He planned
to meet a number of leading Americans for the purpose of
soliciting contributions, He algo planned to contact Dr.

. FREDUROCKETT, a Miami Dentist, and an active member in
the JOHN BIRCH Society. BATISTA felt that through

“eg CROCKETT he could solicit funds from the JOHN BIRCH

; Society.

BATISTA was working on a 12 page memorandum
designed to show the organizations needs, what could be
accomplished with sufficient money and material, and re-
quested individuals to contribute ts the MGC, This memor-
andum was written in English and was planned by BATISTA
,to serve as a stimulus for money contributions from
Americans.

 

On September 9, 1964, classes were given in
the theory of demolition at the MDC military headquarters.
BATISTA stated he planned to leave Miami about four. days
previously but he has had preblems with the U.S. Immigra-
‘tion and Naturalization Service (INS), and consequently
he had postponed his trip.

On September 15, 1964, BATISTA's followers at
the MDC military headquarters were getting ready to ship
military equipment out of the United States. They were
packaging and crating miscellaneous military equipment
and planned to make the shipment on September 16, 1964.
