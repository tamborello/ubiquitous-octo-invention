LA COSA NOSTRA:

a, The Central Bureau, Criminal, Division, Italian
National Police, Rome, Italy, advised in 1967 that the
Judicial Tribunal. of Rome had inquired if Scimone was ever
considered a suspect in the attempted murder of Larry Gallo,
a New York hoodlum, or if he had otherwise come to the attention
of the New York Police authorities.

Investigation conducted by the New York Office
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1967 determined
that Francesco Scimone, known to the New York City Police
and ‘involved -in the attempted Larry Gallo murder, is not
identical with the above-mentioned Scimone, the band leader
and Manager of the Coral. Gables Club, Weymouth, Massachusetts.

 

 

Scimone; in a previous interviéw, advised he had
started civil action against 23 newspapers in Italy for
"defamation of character," which action is being handled by — {
his attorney in Italy and he also had legal representation . F
in the United States relative to this matter.

 

It is requested that Legat, Rome furnish any
and all pertinent information regarding Francesco Scimone
