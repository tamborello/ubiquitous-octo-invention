1. a. The cryptonym{FUTUBE is apparently a garble an@/FRTURE

is probably meant instead. This is a cryptonym belonging
to LA Division assigned to a U.S. citizen formerly of
operational interest to us. His true name should not

be divulged because, according to our records, he still
resides abroad in the country against which he. was
targeted as a reporting source. Revelation of his
identity and of his past association with us would be
dangerous to his security. co

b. The cryptonym KUTUBE referred to FI Staff, now known
as the Operations Staff.

c. The eryptonymJDNLIVID was assigned to a sensitive foreign
operational target personality whose identity should not
be revealed for reasons of his personal security.
