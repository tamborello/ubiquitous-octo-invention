A Re Newark airtel to Bureau dated 7/26/62.
g

Referenced Newark airtel expresses Newark's
inability to understand the meaning of a sentence described
by NEWARK as being on page 4 of Philadelphia airtel to
Bureau dated 7/13/62. It is believed that Newark is
questioning the last sentence of paragraph 3 on page 5.

For the information of Newark, PH 614-C-TE is
not "absolutely certain" that TONY (LNU) is from Trenton,
N.d.3 however, he "believed" TONY LNU is from the
Trenton area as stated in Philadelphia airtel dated 7/13/62.

 

 

Informant stated that his beliefe is based
on two observations:

(1) ONY's obvious friendship with CHARLES
COSTELLO, a resident of Trenton, N.J. rN

(2) COSTELLO's statement to informant that TONY
had seen him tGegaEeno} driving in Trenton and that TONY .
had told him (COSTELLO) the names of streets on which he
(COSTELLO) was driving when observed by TONY.

Informant was again contacted 7/27/62 concerning
the above and was unable to furnish additional Information.
PH 623-C*;has to date been unable to furnish additional
Nlanformation eoncerning TONY's identity. Leos
