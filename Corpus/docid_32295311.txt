ADMINISTRATIVE:

NO 1457-C-TE advised on September 4, 1967, that. CARLOS
MARCELLO had indicated.to the source that he had been in touch
with several individuals who had appeared.in the. recent ."Life"
magazine article. From speaking with these individuals, MARCELLO
is convinced that the whole "Life" article was based on information
obtained from "bugs". MARCELLO determined from the unknown
individuals with whom he spoke that they are just. going to sit
still for this situation. MARCELLO advised that he is not going
to sit still for it as he feels he is politically too strong in
Louisiana,

Informant believed that MARCELLO has probably been’in-
touch with some of his political associates and advised them of |
his belief relative to the source of the "Life" magazine article,

NO 1457-C-TE, on September 14, 1967, advised that CARLOS
MARCELLO is highly enraged at his attorneys for allowing a change
of venue motion to be granted in Federal District Court, Eastern
District of Louisiana, on September 13, 1967. MARCELLO and his
attorneys never thought such a motion would be granted and this
motion was merely for harassment purposes.

Informant stated that during the evening of September
13, 1967, MARCELLO roundly cursed his attorneys and during the
evening of September 13, 1967, he also telephonically contacted
several unknown political figures.: These contacts were for the
sole purpose of attempting to determine how he could have the:
change of venue motion decision rescinded. Informant stated
that MARCELLO firmly believed that he can beat any case in the
State of Louisiana;..however, he is in real trouble if tried
outside the State of Louisiana.

Informant stated that during the evening of September
12, 1967, he determined that CARLOS MARCELLO had two electronic
devices which. he contemplated introducing into evidence in Federal
District Court on September 13, 1967. MARCELLO had an electronics
expert waiting to testify relative to these .devices. MARCELLO
contemplated claiming that one device came off a telephone pole
at his Churchill Farms Estate and the other came. from his home at
3908 Clifford Drive, Metairie, Louisiana. MARCELLO intended,
through. his attorneys, to allege that these devices were United
States Government devices.

On September 22, 1967, the Houston Division furnished '
the duplicate sheets of the Gulf Oil Company Credit Card issued :
to MARCELLO for the previous six-month billing period. No :
information of value was contained in these bills. H

It is noted that MARCELLO has received extensive |
regional coverage due to a recent series in "Life Magazine". |

The period of this report overlaps the period of the
previous report due to investigative results not reaching case i
file in time for inclusion in last report.

New. "fT" symbols assigned to instant report for clarity
and to protect producing informants.
