On 3/15/67, the Liaison Agent met with Richard
Helms, Director, CIA, and took the opportunity to review
the status of relations between FBI and CIA, It was
felt that this was an opportune time to do so in view of
the Director's concern:as expressed above.

"Bao 4nOh @

Helms stated that he personally was pleased with
‘Yelations between the two Agencies, He stated that sometines
he is irked or disturbed when people outside and inside of”
the Government ask the question "How are you getting along’
with the FBI?" He indicated that this question is frequently
=" asked by members of Congress, Helms stated that he
religiously has followed a practice of lucidly and firmly
advising such people that relations are excellent, He-
stated that he personally believed that this was true,

| to be concerned regarding éffective coordination on those | we
cases which are of interest to both FBI and CIA because there
appeared to be developing an atmosphere where people in both
Agencies felt that there was now wide-open liberty to conduct
operations and activities of a joint nature, The Agent “er
stated that he wished to emphasize that such an atmosphere ir
, cannot exist and that Mr. Hoover would never condone any ue
[trend in this direction, The Agent commented that work in
this area had to be very efficiently coordinated and that we-
in the Bureau were closely scrutinizing) each Situation as it
develops where both Agencies had arsintérest. The Agent
suggested that Mr. Helms. might desire to alert appropr iate
