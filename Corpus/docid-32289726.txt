ALEX oh either h/23 or 2u/59, and that this was the frst
time he has seen him for several weeks. He stated that
this is not particularly unusual since he very frequently
does not see tenants from month to month. He stated '
that last week he was in contact with ALEX due to the
fact that ALEX renewed his félease until 4/30/60. He
cannot remember whether Mr. or Hrs, ALEX paid. the rent
for March and stated that it was paid, as always, in
cash.

- 180 West Randolph, advised on 4/27/59, that ALEX is a
member of his club and that he was in the club on .
. u/2k/59, but that he does not recall whether ALEX was
in town during the latter part of February or during any time
in March. It is noted that POSTL is believed to be
senile and is not particularly cooperative, he stated
that there were no records which he could check to
determine whether ALEX was in town during March, 1959.

ALEX, was in Florida from December, 1958, until April

Law 10(a)2

  

it is noted that Mr.
CHRISTIANSEN and other officials of the bank have refused
ibe re-examined
and the only reason they furnishe em in the first
instance was due to the issuance of a subpoena in con-
nection with an investigation being conducted by Secret
Service, It is noted that these companies are controled’
by EDDIE VOGEL, Chicago top hoodlum, and that investigation '
at the companies to determine whether ALEX was in town
on 3/4/59, has not been conducted due to the fact that
it is obvious VOGEL would furnish no information in that
regard and that he would furnish details concerning con->
tact of him by Bureau Agents. :
The informant, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised that he observed .
ALEX at the Tradewinds Restaurant on Rush Street, in
Chicego, on the night of 3/23/59, but. could furnish no
information concerning ALEX's whereabouts in early ‘
_ March or at any other time.

Information was received this week indicating
that possibly ALEX was maintaining a second residence
in the Esplenada Apartments, 900.Lake Shore Drive, but
extensive investigation this week at that address and
at the realty company which manages the Esplenada Apant-
ments, determined that ALEX has never lived there.

 

‘Contact has been made with the following
individwals at the following airlines who carry almost
all travelers of this area to Burope. This investigation
aid not determine that ALEX has flown, under his true
name, from the Chicago terminals of these companies
during the past year. It is noted that ALEX may have
used another name in traveling but this is not believed
