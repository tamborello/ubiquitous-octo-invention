7 investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance is a times . .
consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks, .
includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness, and
availability of’a-suitable position at such time as employment may be offered.
This is called Uelearance".of an applicant. ; |

This clearance - perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware;
‘perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency
make unacceptable. In any event, adverse findings by the Agency are cone
iclusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, and no statement of

specific reasons is made to the applicant. .

3, Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon!
which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment which is subject to full
clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an
unsuecessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptunce
