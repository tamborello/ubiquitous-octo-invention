Howard ang,

Reference is made to my note to you dated 12/21/95,
addressing five FBI documents containing Swiss Government
information, indicating a forthcoming letter from the Assassination
Records Review Board (ARRB) .

The above mentioned letter, delivered from the ARRB
yesterday, is attached together with Hartingh's opened copy; it
advises of the determinations concerning FBI records containing FBI
informant identities and information. A seven day period for
appeal to the President exists, per this letter. The details of
the 47 documents (20 originals and 27 duplicates) at issue in this
letter have been set forth in John A. Hartingh to Mrs. Morris
memorandum dated 12/18/95, which recommended that CID and NSD
advise you of their positions on release of the information
described.

The last two pages of the attached ARRB letter list
mutual consent release documents as of 12/13/95. These numbers
will be verified upon receipt of corresponding FBI document numbers
from the ARRB. ,

I understand you met on this matter this morning.
Please advise me or John Hartingh if we may assist you further in

this matter. .
