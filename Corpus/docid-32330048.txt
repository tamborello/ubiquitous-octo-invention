Reference is made to your memoranda of octchen Tand 10, 2/7622-47
1960, with enclosures, in which you requested to be advised whether
the information developed to date indicates a violation of the
neutrality statutes within the jurisdiction of the Bureau and war-
rants further investigation.

We are of the view that the facts surrounding the invasion
force which landed in eastern Cuba in early October 1960, indicate
a possible violation of the neutrality statutes. You pointed out
in your memorandum of October 10, 1960 » that Masferrer stated that
his boat, which participated in the movement of members of the
expeditionary force from the United States to islands in the Bahamas,
will continue to make such trips.

Accordingly, it is requested that further investigation be
conducted concerning this matter. In this connection, it appears
desirable to reinterview William Otis Fuller with respect to the
information set out in your memorandum of October 10, 1960, to the
Department of State... Specifically, we are desirous of ascertaining

' the basis of Fuller's statements concerning the invasion force which
“left Miami on about September 26, 1960. We are particularly in- —
cterested in acquiring any information in his possession concerning

- his. statement that Masferrer was active in the organization of this
invasion. |

fo Furthermore, it appears desirable to reinteriey aul —loseph
- Hughes and Frank Joseph Williams, who _are_also mentioned in your,
memorandum of October 10, 1960, t9 the Departaent of State anger
