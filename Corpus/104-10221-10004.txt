reveals RICO to be at once a very intellectual leftist wie also hae his

‘feet pleated quite firaly on the ground. His appreach is praguatic, not
time

theoretical. The text of the tape indicates that it was msde sone
after February and before aid-Osteber 1964.

There is little at hand to indicate what manner of man is RICO Galan.

His 201 file reflects facts but not iapressions. ile apparently 1s knew
by LICOOKYs1 and LITAMIL-9 in Hexiso City, and these ten -

sources should be be queried.

Heveacnt (ML) in Mexico Clty, a rabidly antieU.S, and pro-Cestro organi-
gation. Subdjest is slese to Fidel Castro and coapany, and ts ecusidsred
ag a Cuban “agent” (degree of Cuban sontrel unknown), Subjoet was a
foanding menber of tho MLN. In an artiela in Sieepre in xerch 1953 he
rly reflecting thy tdsslogy

advyoeated the feundation of a new political pa
ef Gonsral Lazaro Cardenas, leftist former Prevident of Mexteo. This

weuld have provided, in his helfie?, tho Mextean left a polities] srgani-
zation traly respenaive te tho radics] tendensies ef the 1910 revolution.
This was msesusary beeauss the MLN, whose monbership cevars the spestmaa
