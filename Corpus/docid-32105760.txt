By Brig. Gen. Lansdale

We are in the fourth week of the Special Group's revised plan
; for Operation Mongoose. There are fifteen more weeks of Phase 1, if
| which is essentially intelligence collection with low U.S. visibility. G v

Intelligence collection is reaching a point where the U.S. is

| starting to get a firmer fix in detail on order of battle, the political

. structure, the economy, and internal resistance groups. Our Center

Lee ot in Miami processed 1, 309 refugees last week. The refugee debrief-

_ ing center in Ma is now in operation. Means for debriefing
visitors to Cuba, a number of free world ports, have been estab-

‘lished. Mr. McCone can provide details.

CIA reports one team in place, a second team on the way, and two

; really competent personnel go in. It should be noted that this is
only one sector of the collection effort inside Cuba. Again, I defer
to Mr. McCone for details.

CIA has identified seven resistance organizations inside Cuba,
as realistically potential. A hard assessment, up close, is still to
come, Under the revised plan for Operation Mongoose, proposals
for supplying arms and equipment to these groups will be submitted _ (0
to the Special Group for decision, ad hoc. No proposals have bee: have been _
received.

On political activities, State reports that the Cuban government
was made aware that a deal for the prisoners could be made, through
the Italian UN mission. Also, as reported in the press, a refugee
delegation is seeing the Cuban government, to negotiate a deal, State-
ments calling for a fair trial and humanitarian treatment of the pri-
soners were stimulated from 9 Western Hemisphere chiefs of state
or foreign ministers, and in an OAS council resolution.
