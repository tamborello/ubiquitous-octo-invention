Comment:

ing American
and Swiss press accounts of NOSERKO’s defection

was by error not thar of NOSENKO but’ of .

a sensitive source Vladimir SHUSTOV, whon*SQ3RiM and NOSENKO both
idenrified as a "clean" Soviet diplomat at the
Geneva Disarmament Conference.

Noting the publicity accompanying the defection of -KG3
officer NOSENKO in Switzerland, GOLITSYN recalled that
NOSENKO had been a Second Chief Directorate efficer working
against American citizens.

Comment: Routinely, GOLITSYN had reviewed in March 1962
(before NOSENKO contacted CIA) a list of
Seviet delegates to the Disarmament Conference.
NOSENKO'’s name, which was on the list, did not
at that time prompt any comment from GOLITSYN.

Ail February 1966

Ambassador DOBRYNIN informally notified the Department
of State that a Soviet note would be delivered later to ask
how NOSENKO had left Switzerland, to request his release,
and to demand an immediate interview with hin.

12 February 1964

S.k. TSARAPEIN, the head of the Soviet Delegation to the
Disarmawent Conference, read a staterent at a press conference
in which he strongly condemned the Swiss autnorities for
permitting NOSENKO's “kidnapping” and for hindering efforts
to locate him. TSARAPKIN demanded that immediate ateps be
takem to return NOSENKO to Soviet custody. — - .
