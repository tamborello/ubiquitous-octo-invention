From conversations ak a’ teptesentatives, it
appeared that the agents were compromised because they were
seen to be in direct contact with the undercover operatives
whom CIA had placed. in Cuba. The CIA agents assigned to
the Embassy evidently mixed socially with the CIA undercover
operatives and in this manner became known to Cuban authorities.

 

Another (tgrssentative, DAVI RALES, has
also been recalled to the United States as it has "been
feared that his contact with counterrévolutionary groups
in Havana, Cuba,. might be known to Cuban G-2.

_ With respect to the four operatives who were
undercover and who are presently. being detained by Cuban police,
these individuals have not been seen by any representatives
of the U. S. Embassy for the past month. The Cuban Government
has given no indication as to t penalty they might suffer.

(0 H® CIA station Chief, a expressed his concern
"7, to the Legat, Havana, comcerning the possible action which
the Cuban Government might take against these individuals.
One source informed Legat he was informed by a G-2
representative that the Cuban Government might ask for the
death penalty for these four, but that if such penalty is
decreed, it would be reduced to a jail term of 30 years.

The present set-up of the CIA station in Havana
is as follows:

   
 
 
  
    
 

ibee onl transfer to Rio de Janeiro for the
past month, Assistant Chief. He has explained
that his transfer has been delayed due to the
fact that if he is removed, it is doubtful
whether any replacement would be sent in his
stead. .
