I can't see how it's gonna do.one darn bit of good to have the
fix in Chicago. If he gets convicted in Tennessee, because

if he's convicted in Tennessee and comes to Chicago witha .
recent felon, he's had it. No matter how much your Judge might
help .. . because under those circumstances ...

. - . it's. just too soon ...-
Inaudible

- « . At least we can keep track of it in Chicago because
we'll be in a position to help .. . apparently they're’ just
gonna make sure that the one down South is...

I don't know why...

N

Inaudible

I don't think it's helped him a lot to get it moved,
. A ft .

Well, I think as a matter of fact, it's probably hurt pecause

this is a little town...

Sort of a home town type thing where everybody knows everybody
and there is certainly no industry there compared to Nashville.
»» in an industrial community .. . why he might just on the

.law of averages get friendlier ...

tee . that bothers me because you surely think that...

He's the fellow I met before...

‘They have, they have...

» » « . and we've worked with Clements and we've worked with
his .. . and these are practical guys

; Well, Clements is . oo I understand a practical ...

+ « « » and anybody that's on the bench down there. is gonna
listen . . . which is from that point of view a practical thing
but it bothers me cause he's gotta come out of Tennessee I :
think without a conviction otherwise when he comes to Chicago

It can't be done by Jimmy, it's got. to be done by somebody

real money. Maybe . . . deposited out of the United States on

had seen Jimmy, of course they were on this negotiation and

‘he was the one who told me about .. . this was actually

before it.was in the paper that they're moving down to
Chattanooga and that .. . tough one . .. I Know from the

work we've done in that state and knowing that state, they

don't like outsiders. I don't see how he's gonna come out unless
they get a fix in there. I just don't know how. This is
the toughest one he's ever had.

Well, I'm not so sure that that isn't actually gonna be the
route, that, they can get some help down there cause’ ....
working as we did... that's a practical state . . . and on
the other hand I've never seen, you know you talk about
clannishness up.in New Hampshire or the clannishness out on
the North Shore in Chicago. Those people are all related to
each other and unless you're in, you're out and they don't
like anybody from the outside. Now that would be true . .
they wouldn't like Jimmy but on the other hand, they're not
gonna like Bobby either... :

One thing that concerns me though is when we talked* in Washington
and talked about the possibility of Chicago and so on . .
