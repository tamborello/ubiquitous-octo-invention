your information is a summary of NSA's contacts with Senator
McGovern's Subcommittee. on International Operations. As indi--
cated in the summary and as discussed previously with Mr. Andrews
of your staff, we have not shown nor discussed any material with
Senator McGovern's staff representative pending the drafting of
an approved memorandum of understanding by your office and the

execution of such an MOU between the Executive Branch and the
Senator. : , :

4. In his letter received by NSA on 20-December; Representa-
tive Louis Stokes, Chairman of the House Select Committee on oN
Assassinations, requested certain information from NSA relating
to the Cuban intelligence network during the period 1959 - 1964.
Chairman Stokes also certified that access to any NSA material
would be restricted to those staff members with a TOP SECRET.
security clearance; access to NSA material, of ‘course, requires
indoctrination for SI as well. No response has been made to
Chairman Stokes' correspondence pending resolution of how NSA
should deal with non-oversight committees. Once that decision
is made, we recommend that any SIGINT information selected for
the Select Committee on Assassinations be provided only by the ;
DoD or DCI as part of a larger submission of data and that the i
SIGINT be properly sanitized.

5. Mr. Ira Nordlicht's 16 December letter to vou vevecvea!
information from NSA on the flow of oil to South Africa and ¥
Rhodesia. At the time. of his initial telephone call, Mr. Nordlicht
had a TOP SECRET clearance. It is our understanding that he has
since been indoctrinated for SI/TK by DIA. While any SIGINT
‘pertinent to-Mr. Nordlicht's request may contain unique informa-
tion, it must be emphasized that SIGINT alone may be incomplete

or misleading unless it is examined in the context of all-source
intelligence information. .In this instance, .after the execution
of a suitable MOU, we recommend the requested information be
furnished by the DCI combining the SIGINT with other materials

“available to him. You may recall that earlier this year the’
: Senate: Subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy requested and was

provided information on Arab foreign-investments and the lifting
and sale of Saudi and Iranian.oil.. This is the information which
was provided specifically to.Mr. Jerome Levinson, then counsel

of the Subcommittee, and which subsequently formed the basis for
a 20 June 1977 letter from Senator Frank Church, Chairmam of the
Subcommittee, to the Secretary of State citing "-...a substantial
discrepancy between CIA and NSA estimates of Saudi crude oil
exports in the first quarter of 1977." This charge was repeated
