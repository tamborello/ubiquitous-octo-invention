Title: CUS ALEX
Characte:  ANTI-~RACKETEERING
Synopsis: ALEX continues to reside in apartment 1001, 4300 North

Marine Drive, Chicago, with his wife, MARIANNE R¥EN

ALEX, however, ALEX has spent very little time in

Chicago since June. ALEX returned to Mayo Clinic

in the middle of November and obviously. is in very

poor health. Information from four independent .
sources indicates ALEX continues to rule the First

Ward of the City of Chicago, including the Loop,

for the Chicago Crime Syndicate, ALEX is associated

with JOHN D‘ARCO, Alderman of the First Ward and . .
reportedly with Captain FRANK PAPE, Commander of the
Central Police District, Chicago Police Department, in
his role as "Boss of the Loop" for the Crime Syndicate.
During his prolonged absence from Chicago ALEX'S
operations have been handled for him by FRANKIE FERRARO,
his chief aide and by LOUIE BRIATTA, his gambling boss,
The authority of ALEX is necessary in order to operate
handbooks and girls in the Loop. FERRARO recently
"fixed" the, State trial of his brother,who was on trial
for shooting his sons, through the efforts of a Chicago
politician who apparently "got to" the local judge

trying the case. In the middle of November, the son

of AL CAPONE requested $24,000 from the Chicago Crime
Syndicate. Four leaders of the Syndicate voted on this :
matter and after some debate, folldwed the lead of ALEX 4
in denying CAPONE's request, ALEX has been eliminated

as a suspect in the $100,000 St. Moritz, Switzerland
