   

or

A. We cannot contradict the facts; it was not even destroyed when the Germans

got out of there.

B. There is ... I am telling you ... you can look at the map ... to Kaliningrad.
You cannot get to Sovetsk from Moscow through Kaliningrad by railway, no.
You can go from Kaliningrad to Sovetsk on a local train, because there is
the narrow-gauge railway from Sovetsk to Zelenogradsk -- it is the former

German town of (?Grants?); this is a resort area) in North Prussia.
A. We are talking about Baltiysk.

B. There was no road to Baltiysk, on the spit.

There was only a highway.

A. There was, and it is there to the present time; it was there before the war,

during the war and after the war.
B. Well, I travelled ... it is a narrow place.

A. I do not know how you travelled; if you did not go by train, it is

something else.
B. No, no, no.

A. Another question -- that there is a railroad; last time, you told me that
you remember very well that ... when you arrived in Kaliningrad, there was

no railroad ... you got there by hitch-hiking.
B. There is no way you can get to Baltiysk by railroad.
A. Perhaps you went by car, not by rail; but there is a railroad.
B. You go this way -- Moscow - Kaliningrad.
A. Railroads go in all directions from Kaliningrad, including to Baltiysk.

B. No.

Well, then it would have been’most easy for me to have transferred at the

station to go to Baltiysk.

Well, let us go back.

You have tried to correct yourseif ((by)) saying, "Sovetsk by the sea",

Let us say so -- it could be; but, all the same, @ person in the Army -- and,
especially, in intelligence -- they do not address letters to him in the way
you seid; they address them to the military unit ((i.e., using the field

post office number)).

No... even... for ... the Far East -- "Sovetskaya Gavan', Military Unit
such-and-such" ... although we were not in Sovetskaya Gavan’.

And, you know , why?

I do not know.

Because it takes the letters a few months to get there.
Why a few months?

Well, not a few months, but a long time, if one will write to the military

unit, as -- during WW II -- "Field Post Office No. such-and-such".

Do you know how the Army field postal system was organized?

I do not know.

If you do not know, then it is not necessary to say "It will take a few months"!

Well, not a few months; it will take a long time.
And in the Far East, they wrote, "City of Sovetskaya Gavan', Military Unit

such-and-such".
And did they also write which oblast or kray?
No, simply "City of Sovetskaya Gavan'".

There is only one city of Sovetskaya Gavan'; it is a large city.

Perhaps you are confused.

No, no.
Sovetsk, Primorskiy ..- Primorskiy ... in my memory, Sovetsk, Primorskiy Kray --

although tr understand very well that there is no kray there ... well, I... I

do not know.

Why?

I have thought about it -- why "Primorskiy Kray"?

It could be that during the war this was one of the fronts ... "“primorskiy
rayon (a rayon by the sea)" ... "morskoy kray (a coastal kray)" os
“primor'ye (coastal area)".

On the map, you yourself see that there is a "Primorsk" and a "Primor'ye” ....
I had not seen the map before this; they did not show it to me ..e«.

Everything indicates that there is something ... "primorskiy" ... Sovetsk.

What there is «se. there is no Sovetsk in Kaliningrad Oblast which is located

on a spit.

Well, look, one minute ... not on the spit, before you go out on the spit.

I will tell you even more --~- Sovetsk is just a little place ... Sovetsk ...
there is ... a narrow-gauge railway ..- but it does not go onto the spit.

The narrow-gauge: railway went to Baltiysk ... Sovetsk.-. there was a check-point
(shlagbaum) before the spit ... they checked passes ..+ Sovetsk ... before

going out on the spit.

Inasmuch as you have raised this question, I wanted to remind you that again

you were wrong. ‘

About what?

When you said that there was no railway.

I intentionally listened to you and did not interrupt.
There is no railway; there is a narrow-gauge track.
I am talking about the railway from Kaliningrad to Baltiysk.

There is absolutely no railway to Baltiysk, and there is no railway on the spit.

_ ‘The railway was there before the war, during the war, and after the war; it

was built by the Germans ... the devil knows when, and it exists to the

present day.

B. ((Asks for a cigarette; speaks in a very low voice.)) You know, I want
to say a word about Sovetsk, Proimorskiy Kray.
You know, it is not just my memory ..--
It is another thing -- perhaps I am confused about the kray, but there is
somthing connected with "Sovetsk by the see (primorskiy)" -- either
Primorskiy Rayon or Sovetsk By the Sea.
And why?
You know, I was thinking -- "What is it?”
Somehow I have connected Sovetsk with Primorskly.
The thing is that yourself said, "Here is Sovetsk" ...-
There are many Sovetske ....
"Here is Sovetsk." -- apparently, in all probability, to differentiate this
Sovetsk from another .. this Sovetsk.
IT have in mind the Sovetsk “by the sea (primorskiy)", in order to differentiate
it from another -- this is why, in my memory, Sovetsk is something connected
with "primorskiy (by the sea)" ... either "Sovetsk Primorskiy” or "Sovetsk of
Primorskiy Rayon" ... well, Sovetsk by the sea.
Now, another thing -- this Sovetsk is a very small place; it is not even a
city; there was no raykom there ... nothing.

Well, precisely, "Sovetsk by the sea", in my memory «+++
A. Well, if "Sovetsk by the sea", what else?

B. It could be this way ... it could be this way «+>
I do not remember, I do not remember.
It could be this ... "Kaliningrad Oblast, City of Sovetsk by the sea” or
ce on

"of Primorekiy Rayon” ... I do not know.

 

I, how ... well, Sovetsk by the sea... it pointed out "Sovetsk -- by the sea".
In my memory, it is "Sovetsk, Primorskiy Kray".

I myself understand: you have reproached me for wy ignorance -- that I do

not know geography, although I graduated from an institute ....-

I know very well that there is only one Primorskiy Kray -- in the Far Bast :

there is no Primorskiy Kray here.

A. That is not a justification.
This is not the telk of an intelligence officer.
A man can make a mistske; but you cannot say at the beginning that you
were there and there and there, and then when they ask you about it, find
some difficulties in answering; and then you'say that you do not know why

you said it and that you were not there.
B. Again, in this case, they will not believe ....

((XG; A and Bispeak at the eame time. ))

 

The question about me was resolved while I was in Moscow on leave in June
1952.

Even the question of my study was discussed.

I refused to take training.

Then the decision was made to send me to the ((Navy Intelligence)) point.
At that period of time, at that time, at that time when the decision was
made and it was decided to send me to that point in Sovetsk, the point was

in Rostock, and the idea was to send me to Berlin and from there to Rostock.

A. I know about that and the rest.

My question was from this field, but was not posed that way.

“ B. I did not get there; why?

Because the base was moved, was moving «+...

a. ((In the beginning)) ... you said that you had been there, but then you said
you had not been there and you said that you did not know why you had said

you had been there ~~ "T was not there".

B. Because, actually, it happened that I was directed to go to Rostock; I did
not go there; why did I not go there?
Because the base had been moved, and they did not know where it was to move

from Rostock.

A. In life, it goes this way -- if a man was there ..-+

And I said that I would not go there -- “why should I go from one eity to
another?

Make a decision on where I am to go, and I will go there".

((Signals end of meeting. ))

I do not want you to become upset.

REEL # 6
30 July 1965

TRANSLATION
A. «ee 5O that we can find a common language.

No matter how much we have talked today, it is impossible to believe that
you were there, in the Baltic, etc.

:

i
B. I told you how I was.

A. want to understand what is the matter; it is in no way understandable
to me -~ you can imagine that if a man were a counterintelligence officer,
or -- at that time -- an intelligence officer, if he was there, he would

remember something.

B. I told you what I did.
What else could I have done if I did not do that?
What else can I tell you?

I aid not do anything else there.
A. Perhaps it would be better to say, "T was not there".

B. I had not been there, I would say, "I never was there”.

Why do I need this -- to get confused here?
A. Tf "I was not there", then, of course, "I" did not do anything there.
B. I told you what I did.

A. Well, the last question for the day -- how do you explain that earlier you
said you were there for quite a long time?

Earlier, you said that you had been on Rugen Island and somewhere else.
B. No; I... just a minute ... I did not say it that way.

A. This is a fact; but then, you said that you were not there.

BS

You see?

B. Why, why? SF in

I told you.
