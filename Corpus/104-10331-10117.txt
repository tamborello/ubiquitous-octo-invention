SUBJECT: DR Station

The DO/IRO discussed with the DDO Front Office the issue of continuing to protect the existence of OR Station in 1960 and 1961 in light
_of the Church Committee report and the impending release by the HRG. The ruling is to acknowledge release of the Station.

I recommend filing a pleading with the court that the matter was reconsidered at the highest levels of the Directorate of Operations. It
was learned during thesa consultations that the existence of the DR Station was to be officially acknowledged in records soon to be
released pursuant to the standards of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. In light of the
impending disclosure, the Agency has decided to acknowledge the existence of the Station in 1960 and 1961. | think how CIA will treat
the requested documents (cables) should be coordinated with the DO/IRO.
