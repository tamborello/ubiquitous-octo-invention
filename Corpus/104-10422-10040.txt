AC/CI/1S
Attached is a request from the
National Archives and Records
Center for a review of all CIA
documents held in the Warren

, Commission records. DDO/FIO
C/CI/1S/PA . s asked whether CI Staff was the
appropriate component to under-
take the review. At the time,

as I recall, Mr. Hartman and

Mr. Crooks were transferring
responsibility for much of the

CS records holding on Oswald

to SE and LA. I do not know

what the answer should be to

Mr. Randall's query. (I apologize
once again for an item which was
unduly delayed. )
