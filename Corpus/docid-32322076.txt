Title: JOHN F. KENNEDY RECORDS COLLECTION
ACT OF 1992 (THE ACT)

Synopsis: Results of indices checks.

Details: On 6/15/98, computerized indices were conducted on the
below listed individuals.

John F. Kennedy Assassination
C) Lee Harvey Oswald

Jack Ruby (aka Jacob Rubenstein)

Marguerite Oswald

Marina Oswald

Michael Paine

Ruth Paine

George DeMorenschildt

David Ferrie

Clay Shaw

It should be noted general and Elsur indices were
searched on these individuals in April, 1992. At that time, ~
Sacramento file 62-34, John F. Kennedy Assassination, was
forwarded to FBIHQ. (File charged out to FBIHQ on 4/27/92).

No other records exist at Sacramento except for a
letter from an anonymous individual claiming to be the daughter
of the late President who stated she knew who assassinated JFK
and that the person was “still very much alive’. It is enclosed
for whatever action FBIHQ deems appropriate.

It is unclear exactly what “archived SAC material” is,
but it is not believed that Sacramento has any.
