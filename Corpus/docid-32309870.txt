and Mr, NEELY said he felt certain that if subject was Ye
being sponsored by New York or any of their other
offices he would have been informed at Miami. NEELY
did not rule out the possibility that subject's activi-
ties might be sponsored,in some way by either the U,. S,
Navy or U. S. Army. V4

prove unproductive, it being noted that New York in its
airtelAdated 6/22/62 had requested the Bureau contact
that gency and attempt to determine the full extent of
CIAYs utilization of subject's group,as alleged by ALEXANDER
I »PRORKE , IFoo interviewed by New York on 6/22/62.
