€ supposed with the assistance of this ship -- was supposed to hijack
a Russian vessel, and in hijacking this Russian vessel, I was supposed
to go off the coast of Venezuela, receive assistance from the local
Cuban colony there, plus the officials that I was in touch with of
the Venezuelan LaborParty, to assist and use the hostages and the ship
_to approach the Cuban Government for the release of Cuban political
prisoners, It was a known fact at that time that Fidel would not
release the prisoners. That would be a propaganda victory, in one
aspect to this operation. But the main overall idea was that when
Fidel refused to release the prisoners, it was then going to be where
we were going to ask for the release of the USS PUEBLO and the
American crew that was captured and being held by the North Koreans.
& ; This was to create -- the capture of this Russian vessel was tO create
q an international incident, possibly put world pressure on the Russians
to release the American crew members and the USS PUEBLO.
OLSEN: Did that ever take place -- did you ever meet that ship
off the Mexican coast? ,
STURGIS: No, sir. I went off the Mexican coast; I went into a
small town called Progresso (?sp); at the time in 1968,
al i I did

rent--lease--a boat in Progresso, Mexico; I went off the coast with this

 

 

boat; I gave a written document to the captain of the boat that if this
boat and the crew and myself and the members of the group were captured

either by any foreign government, that he would have a document sagned
