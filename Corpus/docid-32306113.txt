The.Bureau has been previously advised under Boo
case captioned, "FRED G. RANDACCLIO, aka; ET AL, AR ~ HOBBS re
AcT," Bufile 92-9993, Buffalo File 92-174,..of .the con- .
victions and sentencing of RANDACCIO, STEPHEN CINO,
PASQUALE NATARELLI, CHARLES CACT, § and LOUIS SORGI in

On 1/8/68,-.Deputy U. S. Marshal EVALINE L. WAHL,
Buffalo, New York, advised that NATARELLI is currently in-
carcerated in the Federal Penitentiary, Atlanta, Georgia;
RANDACCIO at the Federal Penitentiary at Terre Haute,
Indiana; and CINO at the Federal Penitentiary at Lewisburg,
Pennsylvania. All of these individuals are to be confined
at these Penal institutions, and any contemplated plans by
Penal authorities to transfer these individuals to any other
Penal institution must be cleared first with the Attorney
General.

Since the conviction of RANDACCIO, the under boss
of STEVE MAGADDINO, close contact has been had by the Buffalo
Office with Top Echelon criminal informants and with local,

_ State, and Federal intelligence agencies in an effort to
determine any changes in the LCN structural setup since
RANDACCIO's conviction.

BU 409-C-TE has reported that no successor to

has been made in the courts concerning RANDACCIO's appeal.
This source stated that no change will take place until
such time’ as RANDACCIO's pending appeal is denied, if this
be the case, in order that no power struggle will result
among members of the "MAGADDINO Family," should the results
of his appeal. prove successful.

This source reported that SALVATORE J. PIERI,
subject of Bureau file 92-6573, Buffalo file.92-389, is.
attempting to curry favor with former RANDACCIO associates
in the gambling field, particularly in bookmaking, without
success.

 

It is to be noted that this source has previously
reported that PIERI is not a member of the "MAGADDINO Family"
but is alleged to be connected with the "JOE COLOMBO Family"
of New York City.

. BU 305-C-TE has also reported that no change has
taken place nor any contemplated pending the adjudication
of RANDACCIO'S appeal on his recent conviction. Similarly, -
this source reported that no replacement for RANDACCIO will
take place in order to avoid any power struggle between the
members of the "MAGADDINO Family" until such time as the re-
> sults: of RANDACCIO's appeal is known.

, Local, State, and Federal intelligence agencies con- -
tacted in connection with this matter have in substance fur-
nished the same information as furnished by the above sources.

As the Bureau is aware, VICTOR RANDACCIO, the brother
of FRED RANDACCIO, is the Secretary-Treasurer of Local 210,
International Hod Carriers and Common Laborers Union of America,
« Buffalo, New York, Bureau file 92-5354, Buffalo file 92-246. '
"It would be logical to assume that in the event any change or
any replacement of FRED RANDACCIO is made by the "MAGADDINO
Family" that the first indication will be the removal of ©
VICTOR RANDACCIO from his position as Secretary-freasurer
of Local 210. In this connection, close contact is being
maintained with all sources of this office to determine any
contemplated changes in Local 210 replacing VICTOR RANDACCIO,
which would be an indication that the "MAGADDINO Family" con-
templates the removal of FRED RANDACCIO from a position of
authority in the "MAGADDINO Family."
