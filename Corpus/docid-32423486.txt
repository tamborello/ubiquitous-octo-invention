Dear Dan:

In keeping with our conversation and discussion of Monday,
21 July 1975, regarding what I feel could be accomplished by getting to-
gether on a more formal basis with the Committee, is as follows.

“First, I feel I could definitely show that Robert Kennedy was the
major instigator during the Kennedy Administration for sanctioning attempts
against Fidel Castro's life by the Agency during that period and, also, in
formulating South American policy for his brother.

Second, we can prove that missile installations were being pre-
pared in Cuba as early as March 1961 prior to the Bay of Pigs, and that
missiles of the IRBM range were installed prior to the end of that year, ive.,
1961, with the full knowledge of the Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy,
and some select Senators. Needless to say, if the information was passed on
from RFK to JFK, it must have put ‘his brother the President in a rather awk-
ward position, At any rate, given the opportunity, we can provide foreign
government sources as well as Cuban underground sources to prove that the
missiles did exist in Cuba in 1961. I remembered it quite well and would also
be willing to testify to the Committee that such was the case. It first became
known to me in mid-1961, at the time I rented the house on 36th Street NW for
Mario Kohly Sr. : ,

If one analyzes the ramifications of this fact being kept secret by
the Administration, the missile crisis must have become a nightmare to the
Kennedys. The Russians finally flaunted their missiles in American faces in
October of 1962, knowing full well they would have to be discovered along with
the large number of their bomber aircraft being assembled in the open on
Cuban air fields. Faced with such a situation, the Kennedys were placed in
the position where they either had to invade the island risking an all out war

or, in effect, give up something. -They chose to give up something. They
chose to allow Cuba to remain an independent state. This resulted in sup-
pressing the exile groups, while outwardly promising equipment and other
held, As you know, six major attempts were made on Fidel Castro's life,
all sanctioned or known about by our own agencies. Of course, none of
these attempts were successful. I feel we have the ability to show the Com-
mittee that the Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, instructed it to be
known to Fidel Castro every time one of these attempts was to be made.

“Third, it is my contention that the missiles were never physi-
cally removed from Cuba ‘in 1962, but were taken back to previously prepared
sites, well camouflaged, well hidden, and out of the sight of either our U-2's
or low flying reconnaissance aircraft. Keeping this fact in mind, youcan ~

_readily see why the Kennedys under no circumstance could allow any exile
group to succeed in an invasion, or allow Fidel Castro to be assassinated,
thus ‘providing the impetus for an internal take over by the underground. In
the event either occurred, the discovery that such installations still existed
intact would end the Kennedy Administration,

_ Faced with the dilemma of the underground continually telling
Kohly of the mis siles' existence and the Kennedys still promising support and,
in fact, in some minor cases, giving it, Kohly managed to maintain a tight
reign on his organization, while being continually thwarted. This situation
came to a head on 1 October 1963. That's the date when the Administration
plew the counterfeiting operation that I personally conducted in Baltimore, and
was the last rnajor shot the United Organizations had for recapturing their :
homeland. This action on the Kennedys' part was completely unreal consi-
dering Maxwell Taylor, the CIA, and several high ranking people on the Hill
were completely appraised about what was going on. . :

By covering up the real facts behind the missile crisis, the
Kennedys were able to successfully maintain a strong political image; but, in
my opinion, it sealed JFK's death warrant. ;

: Certain right wing radical groups associated with the Cuban
exiles and American mercenaries, such as the Minutemen in New Orleans
and Dallas, the Anti-Communist Brigade in Miami, as well as a myriad of
others knowing this information, were incensed | that the Kennedys, although
overtly seeming to support all types of small paramilitary operations, were

Dear Mr. Kirbow:

This refers to your 10 July telephone request for:
1) a newspaper article printed before the death of
President Kennedy in which Castro indicated that Castro
was aware of a plot to assassinate Castro; and 2) a news-
paper article in more recent weeks in which Castro said that
‘1f the American Congress wanted to know about plots to ; —
.assassinate Castro it only had to ask Castro. ; : :

 

On the first question, Daniel Harker filed from Havana ;
a report of an informal interview given to him at a i
Brazilian Embassy reception on.Saturday, 7 September 1963..
This was not a public speech. The Harker item appeared in
the Washington Star and in the Times Picayune of New Orleans.
Please see Tab 1. These are accurate transcripts but we
don't have photographic copies available.

Our answer to your second question may not be precisely
what you want since it is based on a Swedish newspaper report,
and not one which appeared in a Cuban or Washington newspaper
as you had thought. It is attached as Tab 2.
