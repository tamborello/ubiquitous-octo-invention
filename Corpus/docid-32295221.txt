a Enclosed LHM is being classified SECRET inas-
_much as it contains information so classified by CIA. (i)

The Bureau will note that this case origin- /
ally started out as recruiting by/subjects CONSTANZO
and HEMMING of Cuban exilessfor military duty in the
Dominican Republic. It now appears that this idea has
been taken over by GUILLERMO BELT RAMIREZ.and the “~~
Comite Pro Gobierno de Cuba en el Exilio (CPCE), Miami, /

file 105-10238. (5° i.

\
., The Miami Office has a main case file on the _\
CPCE and activities of this organization have been re= /)
ported to the Bureau. ; Se ° :

 

; . Information received from[CIA concerning BELT // -
and VIRGILIO SANCHEZ OCEJO and the CPCE|/should have bees
’ carried and reported in the CPCE file. Au) ‘

subject ATON CONSTANZO PALAU is now a very minor figure
in this meceer | ; ; , oe calpss

The Bureau will_also note that€LUIS POSADA “{j.5. lus
CARRILES, a CIA informant Kand€LUIS SIERRA LOPEZ, a U,S.l¢7-

(8) rns 974-S, who is. an older and more mture man,
with much experience in Cuban exile politics expressed

‘ his opinion that no Cuban force will be recruited and

it is‘ highly unlikely that GUILLERMO BELT will ever get
the support and backing of the OAS and U.S. government.

On July 25, 1965, JOSE FERNANDEZ BADUE, a
coordinator for Cuban Representation in Exile (RECE),
stated that BELT is doing nothing more than offering
an apparatus to the OAS and U.S. government, but it is
highly unlikely that this apparatus would be acceptable.
The majority of the Cuban exiles in Miami feel that this
entire matter is a waste of time and has no chance of
success. :

The Miami Office will continue to follow the
activities of these individuals through established in-
formants and sources and will keep the Bureau advised.
