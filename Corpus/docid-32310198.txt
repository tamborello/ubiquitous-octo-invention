MM 2~192 : ;
a

source who is very close to FIORINI has been unable to
furnish current information regarding FIORINI or the IACB
because FIORINI is presently out of town. This source
did advise, however, tiat:if FIORINI and/or any followers of
his have gone to Mexico, they may be at the Buchanan
Ranch in Cozumel.

According to thé Mexican Tourist Office, Miami,
contacted telephonically onW/2/68, Cozumel is in Quintana
Roo, Territory, Mexico. ()

It is believed that the above U. S. Customs source ~

very close to FIORINI. JOHNSON was formerly contacted
by the Miami Office until his direction was turned over
to U. S. Customs, Miami.

CAUKAS also indicated that U. S. Customs, Miami,
was not conducting active investigation in this matter
aside’ from contacts of the above source.

On 10/2/68, a no-name inquiry was made for FIORINI
at his employment, G. M. Used Cars, 2480 Northwest 36th
Street. According to an employee there, FIORINI departed
about ten days previously to visit his ill mother in Norfolk,
va. He was to be gone approximately one week but has not
been heard from since his departure.

on ‘10/2/68; MM 1312-C advised that he has been
unable to learn anything further regarding the plans of
captioned organization since FIORINI has not yet returned
from West Virginia, where he is reportedly visiting
relatives. Prior to his departure for “West Virginia",
FIORINI indicated to this source that he would contact him
promptly upon returning to Miami regarding possible
service of the source with the captioned organization.
