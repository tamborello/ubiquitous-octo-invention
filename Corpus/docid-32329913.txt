In a letter dated 2/9/60, the Bureau called to
the attention of the Salt Lake City Division the cooperation
that BINION has shown in the past and the information that
he has furnished concerning his own activities as well as the
activities of others, which was of special interest; therefore,
the Bureau instructed that the top hoodlum investigation.
should be closed and that efforts should be made to develop
his cooperation in connection with overall investigations on
criminal intelligence matters. Therefore, on March 10,
1960, LESTER BENJAMIN BINION was considered a potential
criminal informant of the Salt Lake City Office and since
that time has been furnishing information concerning his
activities and also the activities of many other persons in
the gambling business in Nevada on a regular basis. The
information furnished up to this point has been reliable
and it appears that he will. be of value as an informant
on criminal matters in Las Vegas, Nevada, and surrounding
territory.
