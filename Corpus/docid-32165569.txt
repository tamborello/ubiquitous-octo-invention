1964 about Douglas WEBSTER u)

} oO ; . 2 We asked | CIA’ bout WEBSTER. They

: oo _ told us that he Mad~suffered some form of .
nervous breakdown in 1940 and had subsequent]
been rejected for a Foreign Service appointe .
ment. Later, he had been dismissed from a
military unit. In the 1960's he had been
in Indonesia and Malaya with the BARD
Corporation and. the GOODYEAR RUBBER CO.
An un-named Indonesian acquaintance had
alleged. that he was a leftist and a homo-
sexual :

four days, an American and 4 Russian, both '
of whom had had some form of mental disorder |
and had been rejeeted by their respective '
foreign services: should have approached the

‘ British Embassies in WASHINGTON and MOSCOW

with stories about the KGB's involvement in
the actual or intended assassinations of one

3. WEBSTER has now written to our Embassy from Malaysia. a

We enclose a copy of his letter from which you will see that i

he has developed his assassination theories to the point of. of

is‘ “pemarkable and leads one to wonder whether indeed it was just —
a coincidence, It seems t.o us just possible that the approaches

6sey8 Provided you have no objection, we propose to ask the
