Froject, the actual payments made by Mexico City
Station per the terms of cach Memorandum -of Oral
Cenmitment (MOC) and in accordance with Mexican

law and custom exceeded the estimate for termination
costs made by Headquarters at the time the Amendment
(was requested. Termination payments made to each
agent aré as follows:

KDEACTOR-2 (Recruited 1956) $8,160

KDEACTOR-$ (Recruited 1956) 2,366
KDFACTOR-6 (Recruited 1956) 2,830
KDFACTOR-8 (Recruited 1965) 649
KDFACTOR-$ (Recruited 1966) 1,568

The long tenure of three of the terminated
agents, the relatively high monthly salary of
KDFACTOR-2 ($440) plus the computation of the
termination payments in accordance with Mexican
law and custom were the primary reasons that the
final agent termination costs amounted to $15,573.

5. All agent terminations were accomplished
in an amicable manner. No visible security risks
were apparent at the time of the terminations
although any one, or all, of the terminated agents
may at some future date decide to divulge to an
interested party the details of the KDFACTOR Project
operations. KDFACTOR-2, KDEACTOR-5, and KDFACTOR-6
have worked in photo surveillance operations for
the Station since 1956 and, therefore, obviously
have considerable knowledge of targets, former
satesites, personnel, and modus operandi of the
Station. However, since the KDFACTOR Project was
not concerned with incompatible operations or
targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station
relations with the Mexican Government in the event
of exposure of the KDFACTOR Project operations by a
terminated agent are within acceptable limits.

6. It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project
be amended to provide the sum of $7,246 for FY -
T2 to cover the costs of terminating five agents
and two basehouse surveillance sites under this

preject.

: and Termination Request. ~-

j 1, The KDFACTOR Project (until 1970 encrypted
po - - as the LIEMPTY Project) was initially approved in
, 1958 to provide financial and material support for
‘ visual and photographic surveillance operations
i targetted agdinst the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City. In June 1972 the project supported five
agents and two basehouse surveillance sites,
2. The KDFACTOR Project was approved by the
Abpc in the amount of $19,000 for FY - 72 and
$20,000 for FY - 73, Per DIRECTOR 285255, dated
30 June 1972, the ADDO approved Amendment ND. 1
to the KDFACTOR Project in the amount of $9,844
for FY + 72 to provide for costs of agent
terminations,

a : 3. The decision to terminate all agents and
facilities under the KDFACTOR Project was based
on a security review of the project activities
which indicated that the VWBLANKET principal knew
the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations,
including the target, the location of the surveillance
sites, and probably the true names and former
cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project, 4

4, The cost of terminating the agents under the
KDFACTOR Project amounted to $15,573; the cost of
closing down, the two basehouses under the project
was $1,412. The total amount charged to the KDFACTOR
Project in FY 72 was $36,090 which is $7,246 over
the approved authorization of $28,844. The overage
was incurred in terminating the agents and
facilities associated with the KDFACTOR Project.
Although Anendment No. 1 to the project was
approved in the amount of $9,844 to cover the
cost of terminating the agents in the

MEMORANDUM FOR: Associate Deputy Director for Operations

THROUGH: MPS/BG
SUBJECT: Amendment and Termination of Project
KDFACTOR

1. Project KDFACTOR supported a visual and photo-
graphic surveillance operation in Mexico City targetted
against the Soviet Embassy. Assets included five agents
and two baschouse surveillance sites. Termination of
this project, effective 30 June 1972, was the result of
a security review which revealed that the VWBLANKET
principal knew the basic details of Lhe KDFACTOR opera~

tions,

i: @e Agent termination was accomplished without any
immediate difficulties; however, continued security will

. depend on the terminated agents’ silence. In the event

there is a compromise, the risk of damage to the Sta=
tion's relations with the Mexican Government should be
minimized because of the compatible nature of KDFACTOR? 8

operations.

3. The ADDO approved Amendment No. 1 to the proj-
ect in the amount of $9,844 for FY 1972 to provide for
the agent terminations, but an overrun of $7,246 oc- —
curred as the result of miscalculation of termination:
costs. This project action requests this additional ~
sum of $7,246 to cover these expenses, oy

4. The FI Staff recommends approval of this amend~

ment/termination request.
