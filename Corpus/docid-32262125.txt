SYNOPSIS

~

On 4 September 1963, information was received from a source that had administered
@ polygraph examination -to an individual who claimed he was an Anti-Castro Cuban
and that he was to take part in an invasion of Cuba on 12 September 1963, the pur-
pese of which was to counteract a "pseudo" Anti-Castro invasion which was actually
led by three Cuban Communists and is scheduled to commence on “t8 September 1963.
The results of the polygraph examination were reviewed and, although the test
could have been more detailed and accurate, the op9nion is that the subject of
the examination was being truthful in relating his intentions as to his activities
in the invasion of 12 September 1963. The following information was developed,
and was relayed to the Los Angeles, California, office of the Central Intel! gence

Agency on 4 September 1963.
DETAILS

1. Predication |

 

This investigation was authorized by LCDR F.-J. LESSING, USCG, Chief, Intelligence
and Law Enforcement Branch, llth Coast Guard District, pursuant to information

received by an investigator on 4 September 1963.

2. On 4 September 1963, the undersigned investigator became engaged in a conversa-
tion with Mr. Robeft BARRICK, Director, and Mr. Bert BOVAY, Polygraph Examiner,

of the West Coast Lie Detection Center, 842 Redondo Avenue, Long Beach, California.
BARRICK’ and BOVAY related the following: On 30 August 1963, BARRICK administered

a polygraph examination to Loren Eugene HALL who is presently using the alias of
Lorenzo PASCILLO. The polygraph examination was requested by one Bill TEUNNISON
who identified himself as a member of the John Birch Society. T.EUNNISCN requested
the examination be given to HALL to verify the facts that HALL hed told TEUNNISON
regarding his (HALL's) activities in an invasion of Cuban planned for 12 September
1963. HALL was scheduled to give a talk before a local chapter of the John Birch
Society. The purpose of this talk was to raise funds for an invasion group in which

HALL is to take part. During the, course of the examination, the following wes

HALL, Loran Eugene, aka Lorenzo PASCILLO : Page 2 of .3_ pages

developed: HALL stated that he took part in the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba..

HALL is presently on a fund-reising campaign in the United States to raise money

for an invasion which. is allegedly scheduled to take part in Cuba on 12 September
1963. HALL stated that the purpose of this invasion of Cuba is to counteract a
"pseudo" invasion of Cuba which is sdeduled to take place on 18 September 1963.

The invasion of 18 September 1963 is slated to be headed by three groups, one of
which is to depart from Guatemala, one from Nicaragua, and the third groups

point of departure is unknown. HALL related that each of the three groups is led

by a known Cuban Communist. HALL stated the CIA is aware of the invasion of 18
September but has been’ led to believe that these three group leaders are former
Cuban Communists who are now “anti-Castro". Actually, Hall stated, these group
leaders are still active Communists. The invasion of 18 September 1963 has been
designed to oust Castro from Cuba but still retain a Communist regime thereby
allowing the present U. S. administration to play down the Cuban issue for politi-
cal purposes. HALL stated the new regime in Cuba will give the appearence of
over-throwing CASTRO and the establishment of a democratic government but in effect
will still be a Communist stronghold and Soviet controlled. HALL alleges that

the present administration is fully aware of the outcome of the invasion planned

for 18 September 1963. HALL stated that the administration is "for" that invasion
so that the Cuban situation will not be an issue in the forthcoming election. HALL
stated thet the next election for president will probably be between KENNEDY and
GOLDWATER and that GOLDWATER is presently "riding high" politically on the Cuban
situation. HALL stated the purpose of his invasion scheduled for 12 September 1963
[is to destroy refineries, powerplants, etc., and to fight egainst the forces
invading on 18 September. HALL stated he also plans to take motién pictures of
the action and return to the United States for further fund-raising speeches.

The polygraph examiner, BARRICK, stated that HALL agreed not to accept money from
the John Birch Society until his return to the U. S. after the invasion. BARRICK
related that HALL appears to be Cuban in that he is dark and wears a beard but
has no Cuban accent. BARRICK further related that HALL is apparently vehemently
anti-Semitic in that HALL claims that of the one hundred forty top advisers in
the present edministration, one hundred four of them are “atheistic Jews". Each
time the subject of Jews came up in their conversation, BARRICK related, HALL
nearly "went through the roof" berating them. BARRICK stated that the individual
requesting the polygraph examination, TEUNNISON, appears to be well-read on
Communism and "seemed to know what he was talking about". TEUNNISON alleges that
the man directly under J. EDGAR HOOVER in the structure of the FBI is slated to
take HOOVER's job in the event of his death or retirement. This individual, whose
name BARRICK could not recall, supposedly was deported from this country for

his activities in the Communist Party many years ago and returnd¢in the early 1950's
to take his present job. TEUNNISON stated that the planned invasion of 18 September
is just a part of the "international conspiracy" designed to take over this and
other democratic countries.

3. HALL was given a polygraph examination as to his intentions regarding his
activities in the planned invasion of 12 September 1963. The results of the
examinetion were reviewed by the undersigned. Although the results were some-what
slight and difficult to determine, the results indicated weak':truthfulness and

no deception was indicated. It is the opinion that the test was not properly
constructed in thelthe relevant questions were not of significant strength.
