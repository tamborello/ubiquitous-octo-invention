Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for
Additional Information and Records _

Dear Barry:

Iam writing to update the Review Board’s understanding of the status of CIA’s
responses to our formal and informa! requests for additional information and records
that have been requested pursuant to the Review Board’s authority under Section
7(j)(1M(C)Giiof the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) (TFK Act).

We appreciate recent CIA efforts to respond to our outstanding requests. As we have
written in our formal requests and as we have said to you orally, you should interpret
our requests in the broadest reasonable sense. To the extent that you believe that a
request poses an unreasonable burden that we may not have anticipated, or to the
extent that you have suggestions to modify or to amend our requests in such a way as
to better reach our goals, you should not hesitate to make suggestions or seek
clarification. As has been noted in earlier letters, these requests will be incorporated
into the Agency’s final compliance declaration. In requesting these materials, we are
not designating them “assassination records” at this time and we are not requesting that
copies be given to the Review Board. All outstanding ARRB requests for additional
information, both formal and informal, are scheduled to be completed by April 1, 1998.
As noted in your meeting with Michelle Combs on February 27, 1998, we recognize that
some requests, such as CIA-7, are ongoing and w: “ill continue. In addition, the ARRB has
formulated some new requests, CLA-IR-34 and IR-35, which shouid be completed as
quickly as possible.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts involving, first. the formal requests
for information and records, and second, the informal requests for imfarmiation and
records

attempted to influence any journalists or publishers regarding public discussion

at the DO follow-up briefing on April: 1, 1997. CIA has had no response and no
time frame for a response.

FOIAIPA cases they received from anyone for records on the following individuals:

Edward J. Epstein

Josiah Thompson

Mark Lane

Harold Weisberg

Sylvia Meagher -

As a result of PIRD's search, they advised that there were two FBI referrals for records on Mark Lane (F-1993-01446 and
F-1994-02092). | have requested that these files be retrieved from the Records Center for our review. There is no record of requests
received specifically for information on Epstein, Thompson, Weisberg or Meagher.

However, the search revealed three requests that mentioned Epstein's name in the subject line. The requests have been destroyed in
accordance with records control schedule approved by NARA as noted below. { have provided the subject as identified on computer
printout provided by PIRD:

a, F-1980-00168 (The Secret World of Lee Harvey Oswald by Edward J. Epstein all info - Cancelled 9/8/1087 & subsequently

b. F-1981-00894 (Correspondence hewteen IPD & Anthony Summers and/or Edward Jay Epstein - destroyed 8/5/1985)

c, F-1988-01338 (George de Mohrenschildt documents released te Edward J. Epstein - destroyed 7/6/1993}

The search revealed one request that mentioned Waser in the subject line. File destroyed as noted below. Once again, | have provided

a. F-1977-00383 (NIS referral - JFK and Oswald documents, 20 Oct 83 - this is identical to release made to Harold Weisberg also as
result of same NIS referral - destroyed 6/12/1997}

At your specific request, PIRD also conducted a search to determine what requests had been received FROM the individuals referred to
above on any subject. The results of their search revealed the following:

Edward J. Epstein - 10 FOIA requests received all of which have been destroyed in accordance with the records destruction schedule.
Josiah Thompson - no requests received
Mark Lane - 6 FOIA requests and 1 PA request (F81 REF) received. The records show that four of these requests have been destroyed
and that there is no data such as Job and Box number to indicate the

disposition of the remaining 3. However, | have been advised that since the remaining three are such old cases it is almost
certain that they have been destroyed as well. These three are identified below

1. This is with reference to your 2 February 1998
memorandum (Tab A) and our subsequent telephone conversation
on 6 February wherein you requested that the Directorate of
Administration (DA) search for files or records on Warren
Commission critics Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark
Lane, Harold Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher.

2. Based upon the limited biographic information
provided on Subjects, the Office of Personnel Security
(OPS), the Office of Human Resource Management (HRM) and the
office of the Publication Review Board conducted thorough
searches. No records were located on Josiah Thompson or
Mark Lane. As you know, OPS located a file on Harold
Weisberg as a result of its search in response to CIA-IR-27
(DA/IRO No. 14). At your request, on 6 February 1998 (Tab
B) we requested that OPS make arrangements to have this file
reviewed by the ARRB to determine which documents are
Assassination Records. Accordingly, OPS did not address the
Weisberg file in this CIA-IR-11 response.

3. As a result of DA's searches (Tab C) we located the
following files and/or information:

Edward J. Epstein - AIN 0 488 768 (found in OPS)

CIA-IR-09 George Bush Computer Search.

The Review Board provided CIA with a copy of an FBI document, dated
November 29, 1963; prepared under the name of John Edgar Hoover, which
states: “The substance of the foregoing information [on the assassination of
President Kennedy] was orally furnished to Mr. George Bush of the Central
Intelligence Agency ....” We have been informed that the DO has no record of a
“George Bush” being in n the employ of CIA in 1963 with the exception of

Mr. George William Bush who has already given a sworn affidavit that he is not
the “George Bush” in question. It is our understanding that the CIA has
confirmed that the search query included George Herbert Walker Bush prior to
1970. CIA should determine whether George Herbert Walker Bush is the person
to whom the memorandum refers and should provide a definitive statement
regarding the scope of its search and the basis of its conclusion. Any and all
personnel files of George Herbert Walker Bush should be reviewed to determine
whether he had any affiliation with CIA during the 1963 period. Once the formal
statement is provided, this request will be complete.

CIA-IR-10 IG Reports.

CIA will determine whether the IG’s office maintains an index or inventory of its
reports and determine whether the IG’s office prepared a report on the handling
of Oswald. Since April 1997, CIA has had no response and no time frame for a

_ Fesponse.

3To the extent that CIA possesses FOIA files or records on any of these

with the courts, such records are being requested for review by the Review Board.

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

 

Dear John:

Iam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concer about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board's requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)! and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April-1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so. that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CLA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CLA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.
