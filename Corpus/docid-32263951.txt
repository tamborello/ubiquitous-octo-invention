that Ferries father had died. Boesch was interested in flying
and this brought him in contact with Ferrie, Ferrie had hair
when he first met him, Later he saw Ferrie and Ferrie wasbald
because of some type of accident, Ferrie flew many of the
Cadets around the New Orleans Lakefront, Boesch once flew with
him over a seminary north of Lake Ponchatrain and Ferrie mentioned
that he was either a priest at one time or that he had studied
for the prissthood. Boesch thought that he might have indicated
that he went to that seminary to stydy. Boesch stated that
_Ferrie had his own plane at the time and was doing well, Ferrie
was very intelligent and to Boesch's knowledge he never had any
tendercies towards homosexuality. Boesch was surprised to
learn later from others that Ferrie had drinking parties at
his home and about some of the other things he herad about,
Boesch left the CAP around 56-7 and did not hear of any of the
Cuban issues or Ferrie's troubles with the airlines until
much later, Boesch remembers Ferrie as a decent sort of guy
that was interested in flying and teaching flying to kids.

FERRIE and Boesch went to the MOisant Squadron to help
them get started witth a CAP program, Ferrie did not like the
idea of girls learning anything about flying. He was even
against them being in the CAP, Boesch went to Moisant for
two or three months and remembers seeing LEE HARVEY OSWALD ©
there, He can remember because there were only 12-15 people
at those meetings as opposed to sometimes 60-80 at Lakefront.
Boesch did not have any social contact with OSWALD but remembers
him as wif) He remembers others by faces but can not put ~
names to thém because they did not gain the notoriety that
Oswald did, He ean not place Oswald and Ferrie together at any
other place then these meetings,

saw
Boesch last FERRIE when he (Boesch) was driving a public
service bus, Ferrie was handing out leaflets on Canal St.
and Elks Place and he waved to Boesch after seeing. him, Boesch
didn't know what the leaflets were about but later saw on
televésion that this group (others unk) was handing out leaf-

lets about Cuba. He can not remember if they were around the
same time as Oswald was arrested, .

Boesch stated that he never visisted Ferrie's apartment
on Atherton Drive or on Louisiana Ave. He had no knowledge
of the parties that went on there, He Suggested that the
following might be able to help us: James Lewallen, from Dave's
home town, Gene Cheralack (sp)-a radioman whose family owns
Ferncrest Day School. .
