The foregoing individuals were also listed as

Authorized sto¢ék was to be 1,000 shares of Capital
Stock without par value.

Confidential Informant BA T-1, who is familiar with
the gambling element in Baltimore, Maryland, advised on
March 20, 1964, that he had had no recent contact with JOE
CORBI except that he had seen him for the first time in several
years. He mentioned he had known JOE CORBI very well in
their younger years. He added JOE was never active in the
rackets until about 7 years ago when he got caught in a one
million dollar lottery deal out of Canada. JOE CORBI had
been picked up in Baltimore. Informant knew that béfore this
had occurred JOE CORBI had driven a truck for Free State
Brewery and when Free State Brewery went out of business he
took over the management of the Villa Nova Night Club.

On March 6, 1964, Confidential Informant BA T-2
advised that the prior arrangements with FRANK CORBI regarding
weekly lay-offs from numbers operators to FRANK CORBI through
HITTY WILDSTEIN had been cancelled. Informant advised that CORBI
was not then receiving lay-off money from any gambler in
Baltimore due to instructions received by CORBI from JOE GALLO,
a New York hoodlum. This weekly lay-off money was not to be
collected until JULIUS SALSBURY is released from confinement
for evasion of Federal income tax. .
