ing information concerning JOSEPH ZERILLI, whom he has known
for over forty years.

JOSEPH ZERILLI came to the United States in 1914
from Terrasini, Sicily, and- entered the United States at
New York City, New York.

Source stated that after ZERILLI arrived in
New York City, he immediately came to Detroit, Michigan,
where his oldest sister, JOSEPHINE ZITO, and her husband,
THOMAS, lived. Upon his arrival in Detroit, ZERILLI. took
up residence with his sister and her husband at 2259 East
Congress Street and secured a job as a milkman.

Source advised that after working at this job for
a year or so, ZERILLI got married and rented the upper flat
of the ZITO house on East Congress Street. Shortly after
ZERILLI's marriage, he secured a laborer's job with the old
Morgan-Wright Company which did all of the construction work
for the Michigan Consolidated Gas Company in Detroit.

After World War I, ZERILLI with his. brother-in-law,
WILLIAM "Black Bill" TOCCO, started a small Italian bakery
in Detroit which, according to source, prospered very well
and ZERILLI and TOCCO both worked very hard at the bakery
making it a success. ;

Source stated that along with the bakery, ZERILLI
and TOCCO sold imported Italian cheese and other imported
Italian foods retail. It was through selling the imported
Italian cheese and foods, according to source, that ZERILLI
and TOCCO became acquainted with the late JOSEPH PROFACI
of Brooklyn, New York, who was in the importing and exporting
business.

Source advised that he had heard it was through
this business that PROFACI, ZERILLI and TOCCO became very
close friends and business associates inasmuch as ZERILLI
and TOCCO were the only Italians in Detroit who were selling
Italian cheese, foods and spices,
