or establishments in order to avoid prosecution by
United States security agencies. He commented that
his organization has men in New York, New Jersey, Miami
and Washington, D. C., as well as in California, who
can be used in these terrorist activities. He claimed
that complete preparations have been made and these
men are only awaiting orders to begin this campaign.

MM T-3 stated that RODRIGUEZ definitely _.
indicated that this campaign of terror would only
take place in the event the United States should sign
a peaceful coexistence agreement with the CASTRO
Government. —

On December 20, 1972, MM T=-3 advised that he '
had received no additional informé#tion reflecting that | 4
RODRIGUEZ has taken any steps to carry out his plans.
MM T-3 recalled, however, that in about December, 1971,
RODRIGUEZ disclosed that he had three “Lapiceros",
(.an M~-L time delayed device used to detonate a bomb),
and that he needed some C-4. RODRIGUEZ then added that
he already had some dynamite and a clock.

of the Junta Cubana Revolucionaria (JCR). The ASI is
headquartered in Miami and the JCR in New York City.
CONRADO RODRIGUEZ SANCHEZ, a Cuban exile and former labor
leader in Cuba, now residing in Miami, ‘Yepresents both of these

- \erganizations in Miami. The membership is composed of

Cuban exiles residing in Miami and the New York area.

Previous. investigation also disclosed that in
October, 1971, RODRIGUEZ allegedly had plans to blow
up diplomatic establishments of countries wnich maintained
relatiom with Cuba and he was accumulating the explosives
for that purpose. These plans, however, never materialized.

' On April 10, 1972, MM T-1, who is well acquainted
with many Cuban exiles in the Miami area, reported that

- RODRIGUEZ. was looking for ‘some C-4 plastic explosives during

the preceding week or 10 days.

; On May 26, 1972, MM T-1 advised that RODRIGUEZ
met with leaders of several other groups several days
previously to discuss the possibility of organizing some
sort of anti-CASTRO sabotage program to be carried out
outside the United States. Among those attending this
meeting were MIGUEL and JUANA ISA, Publishers of a

“If the U. S. abandons Cuba and betrays the

principles of anti-Communism, the Veterans of Fort Jackson . -

would react. with violence.

* RODRIGUEZ stated that his group has no quarrels
with other anti-Commmist groups, only with FIDEL CASTRO
and his followers. If the groups fail to work with the ©
Comite Ejecutivo Libertador, one should ask TOMAS CRUZ
for the answers.

“ISRAEL PINO stated that the Cubans who become
involved in local politics are no longer exiles, but
aconomic immigrants. They are Americans, not Cubans."
(All of the organizations mentioned above are anti-
CASTRO Cuban exile groups).

On December 8, 1972, MM T=3, who is acquainted

_ with some members of the ASI advised that CONRADO
RODRIGUEZ disclosed that he had attended a meeting ;
held in New York City on November 24 and 25, 1972 with
the delegates of the ASI and JCR. At that time, there
was a discussion concerning action, which would be taken
by these two organization in the event the United states
should sign any kind of a peaceful coexistence agreement
with FIDEL CASTRO of Cuba. RODRIGUEZ disclosed that it
was agreed that these organizations would initiate
terrorist activities inside the United States. He pointed
out that the principal targets would be ships belonging to
countries that would trade with Cuba. Other targets
would be diplomatic establishments of countries that |
maintain relation with CASTRO. He said that these
‘organizations would avoid attacks against American ships
