FRANCISCO M,. MELENDEZ, Deputy Collector, United
States Customs, Ponce, Puerto Rico, on January 17, 1964, advised
that a yeek or so before the "Vertis" arrived in Ponce, RAMON EB.
4 DAPENAWVIDAL». described by MELENDEZ as an insurance agent in :
“Ponce, ‘came to the offices of United States Customs. DAPENA
requested information as to the requirements for becoming or
acting as an agent for a ship coming into Ponce. DAPENAhad no
information concerning the ship's cargo nor did he know where the
ship was coming from. Based on the fact that little was known
about the ship, Customs said the vessel could enter but that
the agent would have to place a bond of $10,000, ‘This was done.

ALBERTO A. PICO, Supervisory Customs Agent, United
States Customs, Ponce, Puerto Rico, on January 17, 1964, advised
that DAPENA had come into the Customs office about two weeks
before the "Venus" arrived in Ponce and requested information
concerning becoming an agent for a ship. PICO furnished him
with the necessary documents to be completed by DAPENA and gave
him information concerning the obtaining of a bond. PICO |
explained that ships entering United States ports, when the
cargo was not known, were placed under bond to insure that no

goods on which there is a duty would be unloaded before checked
by Customs.

According to PICO, it was determined, when the ship
arrived, that she carried no cargo. On the after deck she
carried 10-15 empty oil drums. The ship, on arrival, was yellow
in color and PICO noted that the ship, while in Ponce, had -been
repainted and now has a blue hull with a grey superstructure,
