CG 92-350 Sub U

by LURIE, MARCY, and Alderman D'ARCO, According to
CG 6443-C, this lot is utilized by persons in the First
Police District to drop off Police payments which are
in turn picked up by either Policemen or the "bagman"
in the District. This informant has further advised
that JOEY DI VARCO has utilized this location as a
drop off point for payments for Police favors also.
LURIE has been known to be very close to LOUIS ARGER
and CHAPPIE BERTUCCI, two Syndicate hoodlums who
operate burlesque houses, strip joints, and amusement
palaces on the south side of Chicago's Loop.

It is interesting to note from the foregoing
conversation that the apparent close relationship held by
Chicago hoodlums with the Exchange National Bank stems
from the personal relationship existing between JOEY
DI VARCO and GEORGE SAX, President of the bank, The-
reference in the early part of the foregoing conversation
that LURIE made to the fact that "he held off getting
the money" for Little CAESAR refers to a loan owed him
by JERRY SAX, son of GEORGE SAX, It is pointed out also
that SAX is known to have operated prostitution activities
in his Saxony Hotel, which was formerly owned by him in
Miami and which hotel was a well known hang-out for
Chicago hoodlums who were in that area in years gone by. \

DOMINIC SENKESE is a brother-in-law of TONY ® }
ACCARDO and also runs a Loop parking lot, JOHN MATASSA| :
is one of the top lieutenants for SAM GIANCANA and has
not been known to be employed by any union much less
that of JOEY GLIMCO in present organizing tactics. |
GLIMCO is well known to the Bureau as a Chicago top
hoodlum and head of Teamster Local 777, Taxicab Drivers:
Union, JULIUS ECHELES is one of Chicago's leading
criminal attorneys,

JOHN LARDINO is a former Business Agent of |
Local 450, Hotel Clerks, Restaurant Employees and ,
