Ll. On 30 December, the undersigned met with Howard

Moore, staff member. The meeting was to permit the Committee
to read an KSA end-product report on Cuba in response to the
Committee's letter #5900 dated 20 December 1976. ‘The Committee
staff members exhibited keen“interest in the product and the

“two Cuban national names contained therein. The Committee
staff also indicated that they intended to broaden the scope
of their inquiry and would forward to’ NSA another letter
(which has been received and is inclosed) requesting access
to all Cuban reports stored in the repository for the period
1961- “1085,

2. After the meeting, the undersigned contacted LTC Don
Bennett of Mr. Latimer's office to inform him of the. first
letter since it had been sent directly to NSA. LTC Bennett
indicated that another DoD component had been asked for similar
information. As a result, LTC Bennett stated Mr. Latimer was
revising his earlier containing policy on providing to the
SSCI information on the assassinations and now had decided on
a policy of full cooperation. At Mr. Latimer's direction,

» LTC Bennett will draft a letter to Staff Director Bill Miller
suggesting a meeting between the SSCI staff and Mr. Latimer's
staff; the meeting will focus on projected DoD responses to
the Committee's inquiry. NSA will be invited to attend these
meetings. : :
