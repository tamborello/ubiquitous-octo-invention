‘LEETWOOD Well there's a large Cuban community in Venezuala and they :

‘felt that if they just deported him he would have snuck in
the country ‘anyway and would have set off bombs in Venezuala.

It may have been a kind of: a way of buying him off.
ERGUSON So he got his santuary in Venezuala, then what happened?

LEETWOOD He apparently arranged for. the planting of a bomb on a

 

commercial airplane belonging to Cuba. The bomb went off and |
‘ 73 people on the plane were killed. Two of the people who
actually planted the bomb, confessed to planting the bomb and

implicated Orlando BOSCH. He was then put into jail and he

 

was very upset because he claimed that, well my: deal was that
L had a sanctuary here if I didn't set off any bombs in

Venezuala I wouldn't be put in jail.

/ERGUSON Is he quite bitter about it?
EETWOOD lie's very bitter. about it. He told me, he said he was going | ;
to go to war with Venezuala and when BOSCH says he's going
to war, he means bombs and killing people and while we: were

sitting in jail he said, did you hear about the bombing of-

 

the Venezualan airlines office in Puerto Rico.” I said no.
He said, well we hit it yesterday. “I said, oh yes, you have
better information in jail than I do. Ana he ‘said, yes, there's |

po : going to be a lot of bombing, a lot of kidnapping...

did, I walked in and got in line with all the womenfolk,

was going to see.. Once I got in the prison I asked a couple |
of other prisoners if. they knew where this Orlando BOSCH was
and they took me to him. He wasn't expecting me at all. I
walked up to him and said, hello Dr. BOSCH, my name is Blake
PLEETWOOD, I'm a reporter, I would like to talk to you. He

was flabbergasted. He said, how dadid you get in?

How was he being treated, (a) by the prison authorities, :
and. (b) by his fellow prisoners?

CONFIDENTIAL June 16, 1977

Mr. Joseph A. Marion, Jr.
c/o United States Embassy
Ottawa, Ontario

Dear Mr. Marion:

Further to the Burns/Prentice conversation on -
13 June 1977, attached is a transcript of the 'As it Happens'
ip programme. This concerns the interview between Blake

od, free lance reporter from New York, and Qrlando |
ja, in his Yenezuelah cell. os ;

Cn page 4, ‘BOSCH states that his organization recently
bombed the Venezuelan Airlines' office in Puerto Rico. It
would be appreciated if you could determine whether this
incident did actually occur.

 

 
  
  

Reports of anti-Castro terrorist attacks in the USA
and other parts of the western hemisphere are not always
available to us. These incidents do not have any direct
impact on Canadian security but the frequency of Cuban exile
attacks does indicate the seriousness of their purpose. As
Canada is known to be a potential target area, particularly
Cuban establishments and personnel, it would assist us
in evaluating the potential threat to Canada if we could
be advised of those anti-Castro incidents that come to the bd

attention of your organization.

* E. R. J. Miller
Assistant/Officer i/c
L, Security Intelligence

Yours truly,

MAITLAND Orlando BOSCH, one of the world's most dangerous terrorists,
may be behind bars but he still is the spider at the centre

of the Cuban web of terror. The one time friend of Fidel

“CASTRO has! admitted to countless murders and bombings and
says he will stop at nothing to destroy the Cuban Premier.
BOSCH is now inva Venezualan prison awaiting trial for the
bombing last October of a Cuban plane off the coast of
Barbadoes. Even in jail he's directing terrorist activities

around the world.

and he hadn't talked to a reporter in all that time. I went.
down there just on a hunch that maybe I could talk to his:

going on down there. I hoped that maybe I might be able to

get some written questions to him. But I found out that on
