“(BENITEZ has been identified)

(Originally referred to by the Cubans
as.Oscar Luis ACEVEDO. The FBI points”
-out spekbing should be Oscar Luis :
“Cuban and’*FBI DOB's match.
Therefore it is felt that all are
talking about the same person. This
individual has keen identified)

(originally. ceferred to ky the Cubans
as Carlos DE VARONA. The FBI had no
recorg of a DE VARONA) - 8

The Cubans referred to a Israeli

DEL PLINO originally. The FBI believed
DEL PINO to be the same person as
Israel PINO-RAMOS, DOB: 29 Aug 36.
Obviously they are not the same person)

(The three PINO's mentioned are not the
same person and it is-impossible to
mateh the correct one to the pHétograph
without further particulars} nan
(Cannot establish which Israel PING
matches the photograph. Therefore we
cannot identify subject accurately)

(It has now been established that the

Orlando BOSCH previously referred to by
the Cubans and identified as Orlanca

BSO0SCH AYILA are not one and the sane
persons. We also cannot establish
whether or not. Grlandy BOSCH and Orlando 7
BOSCH MELUSA are one and the same person)

(The FABIAN previously mentioned by the
Cubans and the Luis M. FABIAN PENDAS
mentioned here are probably the same.
