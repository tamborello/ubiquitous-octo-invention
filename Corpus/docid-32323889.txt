the individual introduced to him several years ago at’
Hollywood Park Race Track as JOHN RUSSO or JOHN ROSSI, an
LCN “member" of the Texas "Brugad" by Los Angeles LCN "Capo"
ANGELO POLIZZI. Informant had not seen PATRONO since and

RUSSO or JOHN ROSSI, as these names were the recollection of
an introduction of several years past, and they have not
appeared from other sources as names used by PATRONO,
