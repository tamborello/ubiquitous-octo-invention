two documents that opens the identity of Ricardo Anibal Morales
Navarrete as a source. In the material being processed for
_release there are other documents that describe the death of the
informant in Miami on 12/22/1982. Since the Board's instructions
are to release any known deceased informant without evidence to
justify the postponement, the Board asked for evidence to support
the postponement. Based on the informants death and no known
threats to relatives, the Board would not protect the informant

because he did not meet their criteria of revealing “...the
identity of a living person who provided confidential
information...” or compromising “...the existence of an

understanding of confidentiality currently requiring
protection...and disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs
the public interest....”

. (UX) Although the source testified at the Bosch Avila
trial on~“federal charges of damaging foreign nations' vessels
that were trading with Cuba in 1968, he continued providing
information to the FBI. The source was’ also known as MM 1550-KS
(Key Source) (IS - Cuba), who first started reporting information
to the FBI in 1961. Initially he reported on information related
to Cuban exiles in the United States and then focused on Orlando
Bosch Avila and the Cuban’ Power Action Group's plans to blow up
freighters. The information in the released documents concerns
the informant's knowledge of Avila's actions that lead to his
conviction. However, after 1968, the MM office continued to
accept information from the source. In November 1974, the source
moved to Venezuela and helped the Venezuelan government locate
Avila who was a federal fugitive at the time. After this he
accepted a position with the Venezuelan government and continued
to provide information to the MM office about attempts of groups
in Venezuela to overthrow the Cuban government.

(Ne The Board voted to release information that
reveals the’ source. The information and informant were
eventually used by federal authorities in the Avila trial.
However, there are other documents from the source's file that
will be reviewed as assassination records according to the Act.
Most of the material relates to the bombing matters that
eventually went to trial. However, some information is related to
the time Avila was a fugitive in Venezuela and the MM source was
passing that information to the MM office. The concern of this
office is the information not yet addressed by the Board that
reveals the MM source continuing his cooperation while he served
as a Venezuelan official. Currently in the other documents, not
yet reviewed by the Board, the only information proposed for

. postponement is an attempt to protect the MM informant's

cooperation while he was a Venezuelan official.

({U) Before the documents were reviewed by the Board,
'HERU contacted MM's Chief Division Counsel (CDC) Bill Dolde

concerning the harm to any family or any other concerns the MM
office could have regarding the release of the informant's
identity. The opinion of MM was that should the Board vote to
release the identity, then the MM Office would not object .to the
release. However, MM could not locate their file and did not
know about the Venezuela information.

(U) HERU requests NSD to review the information and
give OGC and OPCA a recommendation concerning the release of the
informant. If you have questions please contact Supervisory
Paralegal Specialist Carol L. Keeley at 4-0671 or Contractor
Classification Specialist Carl L. Valentine at 4-0556.
