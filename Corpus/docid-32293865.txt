Concerning the iam ‘informant's allegation about the Sevilla-
Biltmore Hotel trying to get a gambling casino permit, it is believed
that this information may be true, although this office has no definite
information to corroborate it. Two or three years ago, AMLETTO BATTISTI
leased the Sevilla-biltmore to a Chicago group ‘and one WILLIAM HOGAN came
to Havana as Manager of the hotel. HOGAN died at the hotel aboupthree
or four months ago.and the management was taken over by one SQMSIMON, $L+ Lhe

also out of Chicago. (3) ( U) : “gio

Havana FCI who is connected with the gambling
casino in the Tropicana night club, advised some time ago that SIMON
was encouraging Havana street prostitutes, of which there are many in
the downtown area where the Sevilla is located, to frequent the Sevilla |
bar and endeavor to make pickups there. It would seem logical that SIMON
might try to go one step further and establish a casino in the hotel,
although it is believed that he would have much difficulty in obtaining
a permit due to opposition on part of other casinose ® |

downtown Havana during the’ 1952-1953 season. It has not been possible +o;
