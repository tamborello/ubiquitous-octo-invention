Memorandum Baumgardner to Sullivan .

‘RE: HOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES
_ KLAN INVESTIGATIONS :

15705

The source further. advised that Robert. Scoggins, Grand Dragon
for the State of South Carolina, had been notified: by. the. Veterans
Administration that his disability pension has been reduced. Shelton
feels that this was a retshatory measure taken by the Committee and the .

' Veterans Administration against Scoggins, Therefore, the Klan is
lodging a-protest. with the American Legion and the Disabled American
Veterans,. Shelton stated that when Raymond / Anderson, the. Grand Dragon
for the State of Tennessee, appears to testify before. the Committee,
Shelton and members of the press would accompany Anderson to the.Veterans
Administration to inquire if Anderson’ s disability pension will also be
reduced, % :

 

It is noted that Anderson is a Bureau informant ,- who while
‘ serving in the Armed Forces during the Korean Conflict lost his left.
. ATMs This loss entitled him toa. @isability pension. 4 7
Observations: a

’ Chairman Willis | is béing contacted by Assistant: Diz sector
DeLoach concerning the information furnished to him by Chalmers regarding ©
Oswald-and.to advise Willis that the information is not factual, It aoe
appears that Shelton is circulating the. story in order to possibly
discredit Venable, whor. he feels has furnished information to the
Committee concerning Shelton and. Shelton's Klan organization. - ‘Although
Venable did testify in executive session, -a review of the testimony
indicates that he furnished little or no. information of value, and.
Shelton's assumption is erroneous. oe

The information regarding Shelton's “proposed visit: to the
Veterans - Administration is known only-to a Limited number of individuals
including the source and Anderson, who is also a Bureau informant, in
\the event we advise the Veterans. Administration of this matter, it could
possibly result in the loss of two valuable sources since the Veterans
Administration may reveal that they had advance knowledge of this visit.
It\is not believed that any real harm will be caused by this action. on
the ‘part of Shelton and, therefore, it is felt that the Veterans
Adminis ration should not be advised.

We have
General regarding Wi
