On 8/18/59 FRYE's sister, MARGORIE LOFTICE, was
reinterviewed as a matter of routine and in order to allay
any suspicions by her. LOFTICE denied any contact with any
known persons or with FRYE or POPE since last interviewed.
She stated that about two weeks ago she got a call from an
unidentified man who stated he wanted to talk to FRYE, LOFTICE
stated she had forgot to contact the FBI concerning this call
as she had previously promised.

Sheriff BILL DECKER, Dallas SO, on Lane advised
he had received an anonymous tip that on 8/17/59 POPE and/or
FRYE had contacted Fort Worth police character ANGELO THOMAS
CASTEN requesting financial assistance. CASTEN has been inter-
viewed on numerous occasions by Bureau Agents and has been most
uncooperative.

On 8/18/59 BILL ALEXANDER, Dallas County Assistant
District Attorney, advised he had information from a police
character whom he described as a reliable source, as follows:

When questioned by ALEXANDER concerning the whereabouts
of POPE, source stated he had not seen POPE but that a friend of
his (the source.) had seen POPE about a week ago at a trailer
lot operated by FLOYD VINCENT's widow (LOIS VINCENT) near
Richland Hills, a suburb of Fort Worth. The source stated it
was his understanding that POPE had been in contact on numerous
occasions with LOIS VINCENT during the past two or three months
and that while POPE was "partying with LOIS" PEGGY FRYE was
"partying" with police character, WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN NEWMAN,
The source had no information that POPE and FRYE had split up.
Investigation to verify this information is presently being
conducted by Dallas at Fort Worth.

On 8/18/59 Detective H. M. HART, Dallas PD, Criminal
Intelligence Section, advised he had information that the bail
bond money, $15,000, recently put up for the release of LILA JO
BENTLEY, POPE's ex-wife, consisted of $10,000 on a property bond
signed by LILLY IRBY, BENTLEY's aunt, and $5,000 put up by POPE,
HART stated his informant told him that POPE makes contact with
IRBY for relay to BENTLEY through IRBY's brother in Lewisville,
Texas. LILLY IRBY has been previously interviewed on two
occasions by Bureau agents concerning this bond and contacts
with POPE and has vigorously denied the above allegation.
