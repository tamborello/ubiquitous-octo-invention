was in contact with an individual by the name of NICK (LNU).
According to CLEMENTE, NICK, at one time, operated 13
horse rooms with individuals by the name of JOEY and JERRY.

only made $200.00 a week out of these horse rooms, since
a quarter of a million dollars a year, from 1941 to 1950,
passed through their hands. CLEMENTE stated that NICK

handling the politicians, police, and customers in the

very much dissatisfied with RALPH RUSSO, who is apparently

him about a number of "dead loans" that were involved in
their dealings with LIVOTI and ODDO. CLEMENTE indicated to NYR2

went to LIVOTI about these people, He indicated that if
LIVOTI gave them (MILT TIE and MOISHE) a run around, they

that he would receive the ads for his journal, CLEMENTE

stated that when he questioned MC CARTHY about his association
with CURLY, MC CARTHY: indicated that a lot of people say that
he, MC CARTHY,and CURLY were partners and indicated that,
although this is not true, he sharesvarious ventures with CURLY.

fifty percent of the profits derived. from the advertisements
received in the journal,

CLEMENTE stated that after he and MC CARTHY were
in complete agreement he invited MC CARTHY to have a drink with
him and ascertained that MC CARTHY at that time was a little
worried that JOE CURLY would be highly suspicious if he knew
that he, MC CARTHY, and CLEMENTE were taiking. CURLY.
according to CLEMENTE, would not be to much concerned about
the organization of the bowling alleys, but would be worried
that CLEMENTE and MC CARTHY would be talking about IZZY
SCHWARTZ. CLEMENTE assured MC CARTHY that he had no interest
at this time in IZZY SCHWARTZ, and,as far as CLEMENTE was
concerned, this ended the particular dealings with MC CARTHY.

According to CLEMENTE, PROFACI's men stated they had a charter
that they received nine months ago from JACK iC CARTHY.

MC CARTHY to leave the meeting. CLEMENTE indicated that
PROFACI's men were smart and immediately left this meeting and
went back. to PROFACI to explain what had happened.

CLEMENTE made the observation that PROFACI did not
‘trust CURLY or DOYLE and apparently had a very oid grievance
against DOYLE. CLEMENTE theorized that this grievance dated
back to the time that DOYLE was working for LUCHESE while
in the garment center and surmised that JOSEPH MAGLIOCCO was
involved in some dealings with DOYLE, .

MC CARTHY. Prior to this meeting, CLEME ENTE stated that he
had determined that BOB and TONY shared an office with
MC CARTHY, but the charter for the newly orgenized bowling
alleys was in MC CARTHY's office.

At the meeting, CLEMENTE indicated that he asked
MC CARTHY if these fellows had a charter. When he established
that MC CARTHY gave them a charter, CLEMENTE insisted that the
charter be given to them outright and moved to their office.
CLEMENTE stated that MC CARTHY was in agreement with this
move,

MC CARTHY and that MC CARTHY was an honest man to do business
with. He stated that MC CARTHY's only worry in this matter was
