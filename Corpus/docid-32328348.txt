ADMINISTRATIVE

The following information from informants is being
set out on-the administrative pages as they could easily
be traced back to the source,

CG 9561-PCI, on 6/12/72, advised that some years
ago the Chicago outfit headed by LENNIE PATRICK, JACKIE
CERONE,and others,muscled their way into the Black Angus
Restaurant, Chicago. This place became a meeting spot for
Chicago hoodlums. It was operated by BEN EPSTEIN, who died,
and the operation later was taken over by IRV SINGER.

DAVE YARAS became involved shortly following the outfit's
taking over the Black Angus. YARAS spent much time in Miami
Beach, but when inthicago he operated out of the Black Angus.
The report is that he takes money out of the restaurant

for the outfit. :

On 7/19/72, informant advised that Black Angus
had been sold to one CHRIS CARSON, associated with the
Millionaires Club, and that allegedly YARAS, with LENNIE
PATRICK, héd something to do with the deal. Reportedly,
BEN EPSTEIN, who formerly had an interest in the Black
Angus, waS eased out by PATRICK and YARAS who took out of
the place a considerable amount of money. This was managed
somehow through manipulation of the liquor bills for the
restaurant, Informant also advised in September, 1972,

that GUS ALEX, a good contact man for the outfit, has for

: somé time been closely associated with the subject and that
they may have worked out some "sweetheart contracts" with
hotels, :

During July, 1972, CG 6597-PCI advised that he had
t determined that there was a new State of Illinois regulation
: requiring all shop windows in Illinois to be, henceforth, made
of safety glass. According tothe informant, most of this is
now being provided by large companies such as Pittsburgh
Plate Glass, however, because of the weight involved, it is
extremely expensive to ship. Informant advised that he
understood on the plan he had that this glass would be pro-_
duced in Chicago, and if successful, it would have a
tremendous profit potential, Informant went on to state
when they had a meeting to consider and discuss this glass
manufacturing, there was present MORRIE KELLMAN, JOE EPSTEIN,
and individuals who were introduced as DAVID YARAS and his
son, LENNIE. Informant stated that he understood that YARAS
is an outfit-connected individual and that he is closely
associated with two "juice" men who ran a laundry on the
north side of Chicago. According to the source, YARAS made
a.comment to the effect that an investment by his associates
would be an excellent "tax shelter." Additionally, the
informant advised that at the meeting one JOE EPSTEIN made
the remark that YARAS’ offer was to be taken very seriously
as he was with good people with almost unlimited funds.
