MEMORANDUM FOR: Information Review Officer
Directorate of Operations

FROM: David D. Gries
Director, Center for the Study of
Intelligence
SUBJECT: Release of Form 362

1. Thank you for your Memorandum of 27 September giving
reasons why the Directorate of Operations should not release Form
362 (used for name traces) under standards of the JFK
Assassinations Records Act. After careful review, I do not
believe that it is defensible to withhold the form itself.
Information entered on the form is a separate matter; all or part
of it may be withheld _in appropriate cases.

2. The reasons follow:

« The JFK Act requires that a case be made establishing a
clear and convincing link between postponing release of an
assassination record and a threat to intelligence operations
“of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest."
That case cannot reasonably be made for a generic form that
lists a number of offices no longer in existence. Examples
are the Domestic Collection Division, the Central Reference
Service, and the Central Registry. Although an updated
version of this form is still in use, release of the form as
used in the 1970s would not seem to threaten intelligence
operations today.

e As you note in your Memorandum, the fact that name traces
are made in the Directorate of Operations has become public
knowledge. This would weaken an attempt to defend
postponement by claiming damage to intelligence methods.

SUBJECT: Release of Form 362

e Release of the form would not constitute a precedent. The
JFK Act is a unique piece of legislation; it explicitly does
not establish precedents for other declassification
activities, which are governed by specific laws, such as the
Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act, or by internal
CIA regulations, such as the Guidelines for Historical
Review.

e The Presidential Review Board, which must approve all
decisions to postpone or redact documents in the JFK
collection, is unlikely to side with CIA in this instance,
resulting in a costly and publicly embarrassing reversal of
our position.

3. Let's discuss this further and try to find a
satisfactory resolution, which may lie in releasing more than
one-fourth of the form but less than the complete form. Please
give me a call at your convenience.
