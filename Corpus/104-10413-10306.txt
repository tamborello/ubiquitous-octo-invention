can we find ,hotc that PENKOVSKY identified of
MOSKALEVSKIY.

 

May I see PENKOVSKIY's 201 file for period 61-63?

Get photos and check dut MOISEEV and BABKOV.

Via CI Staff, find out if we can show photo to DERYABIN
and ROSTVOROFF?

Could MOSKALEV be Dept 13? Could OSWALD have met with

him in Mexico City clandestinely in 1963?
 

- that OSWALD was involved in the Kennedy assassination

plot, but that he, "Saul", fired shots that killed

Kennedy.

- that two hours after the assassination he, "Saul",
was out of the U.S. That he used limp as a

disguise.

QUESTIONS
1. Could MOSKALEV be "Saul"?

2. Could MOSKALEV, therefore, be mystery man who
boarded plane in Mexico City for Havana on 22
November 1963?

3. Was assassination a Soviet comspiracy without

Cuban knowledge?

RECOMMENDATION
1. Can we obtain voice tape of MOSKALEV, since he
has delivered speeches at scientific conferences
in U.S. and abroad?
2. If so, could we arrange to have McDonald (unwittingly)

hear it, to see if he recognizes it as that of "Saul'!

April 1977

SUBJECT: Theory re MOSKALEV, Yuriy Ivanovich and

Unidentified Man

That Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be identifiable with
the "unidentified man" going into and coming out of the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The "unidentified man"
was recently identified by SLIPSTREAM as a KGB type by name of

"Yuri" whom he knew in Moscow in 1964.

- According to travel records MOSKALEV was in the

USSR in 1964. in the U.S. in October 1963 .

- MOSKALEV functions officially as a Soviet scientist
and often attends international conferences. He

has been in contact with known GRU Soviet diplomat in

the U.S.

MOSKALEV bears a striking resemblance to composite of
"Saul" in book Appointment in Dallas who claims he was involved
in the assassination of President Kennedy. "Saul" claims:

- he crossed border into U.S. illegally and was in
Dallas on 20 November.

- That he had been to Mexico City, had a contact in
Soviet Embassy there, in 1963, and that he knew the
identity of OSWALD because he (OSWALD) had been

fingered to him in Mexico City.
