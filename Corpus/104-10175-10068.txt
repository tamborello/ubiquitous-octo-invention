Defection Program

1. When I phoned COBB this AM, she informed me that she had heard over
tho radio last night that Luis BUCH and two other functionaries had arrived
in Key West, and that a great emotional scene had ensued. The broadcast
also indicated tht BUCH had been working with the underground.

2. Ihave informed both FI and PROP. Dave Phillips was interested since
he had been told by some â€œhigh authority" in WAVE not to release anything
on the defection at this time. He.also said that they knew the identities
of the "2 other functionaries" but hadn't released the names.

3. The broadcast wee called:

Tribuna Democraticia (Spanish language program)
