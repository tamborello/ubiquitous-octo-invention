The following is technical information for review by

_ En a letter dated 2/10/65 in captioned matter, you oa
furnished line information of the telephone service for captioned ~Y,
individual's home, and inquired whether or not the (Radio-Frequency
Wicrophone-Telephone (RFUT) or the Zener Activated Microphone (ZAM) }

techniques could be used to effect MISUR coverage.

 

it. is necessary to alter a Western Electric 500 type
telephone instrument to make it respond te the RFT unit. It
fellows, therefore, that entry must be made into the target area
to complete installation. If entry is necessary, there are other
techniques such as the SPMT and 4-wire devices which should be .
ue considered before resorting to the use of a classified technique
requiring extremely tight protective custody.

: . In general, the ZAM unit follows the same installation
procedures and uses the same line switching principles as the

SPMT device set forth in Chapter 26, Part I » Page 181 of the .
a Handbook of Technical Equipment. A special microphone unit, known
as a ZAM, must be installed at a point in the target area where it
caa be connected directly across the telephone line. The ZAM may
be disguised in a number of different configurations, for example,
in a 42A connecting block, in an auxiliary ringer, in the network
of a telephone instrument, in a block measuring 1 9/16 inches long,
2 §/9/16 inch wide and 2/8 inch thick, etc. ‘The target. telephone
 Zlline must be looped through a local plant between the telephone
g|central office and the target area. While it is desirable to
jloop the target line through a plant by adding a minimum length
of wire, there are installations of record where spare pairs of
wires are used te develop the loop circuit. a

_\ high, and one measuring 11 1/2 : ches wide, 15 inches long and 5 3/4 |
inches high. The space should as dust free as possible and
accessible for periodic maintenance checks,

 

    

if, after weceiving authorization to make a “stirvey of
the target area, you desire specific detaiis concerning the
possible use of the ZAM or other. techniques in, this’ case, submit
cable prints, cable records . Shewing multiple appearances, block
