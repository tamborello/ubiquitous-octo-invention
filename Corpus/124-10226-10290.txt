raid indicated that Rorke was closely associated with Frank Fiorin

and had distributed a leaflet which referred to participation in
expeditions against Castro in the Spring of 1961 which were commanded
by Fiorini, the Commanding Officer and organizer of the Anti-Communist
International Brigade. It was reported that during April, 1963 Fiorini
had claimed that plans were in progress for a new strike"; also,

that Fiorini had been in contact with Edgardo Sopo Barreto of the MRR
who, on 5/1/63, alleged that Fiorini made frequent visits to Manuel
Artime Buesa's organization* where he made irresponsible claims that
were not true. During an interview in Miami on 4/27/63, Fiorini
advised that he first met Rorke in 1960 in Miami, at the home of a
leading anti-Castro Cuban, Pedro Diaz Lanz. He stated that about one
month previously in Miami, he met with Rorke, Hansruedi Tanner and
Geoffrey Sullivan who wanted Fiorini's help in proposed aerial action
over Cuba; however, Fiorini declined to assist them. He denied
knowledge of the 4/25/63 mission beforehand and expressed doubt that
it actually took place:
