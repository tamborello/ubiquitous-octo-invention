of Oswald's voice.* Shanklin cannot explain the statements

set forth in Belmont's memorandum.

* Telephonic staff interviews.of Shanklin and Rudd, on March 4,
1976. Unfortunately, Mr. Belmont cannot be contacted as he has
been seriously ill for quite some time.

‘

By letter dated February 19, 1976, we asked the Bureau
to deliver "all materials pertaining to the receipt, analysis,
review and present whereabouts of the voice recording" referred
to on page five of Mr. Hoover's report to the President. The
Bureau's response, dated February 24, 1976, stated, “The re-
cording in question was never in the possession of the FBI and
was not listened to by FBI agents."* Prior to receipt of this
response the staff met with the agents responsible for its
preparation. The agents then showed us an unexcised copy of
the attached November 23, 1963, teletype from SAC Dallas (Tab)
which advised that "the actual tape from which this transcript
was made has been erased," and the November 25, 1963, cablegram
from Legat to Headquarters which in relevant part reads "Papes
obtained by [deletion] here erased after two weeks following
making of typewritten transcripts of contents of these tapes.
There appears to be some corifusion in that no tapes were taken
to Dallas but only typewritten transcripts supplied by CIA, .
the tapes not being available because they had been erased."
(Memorandum attached at Tab.)

The staff submits that the matter is_not as simple as the
Bureau asserts. Attached at Tab is a Belmont to Sullivan, Novem-
ber 23, 1963, memorandum in which Belmont recounts his 11:50 a.m.
telephone conversation with SAC Gordon Shanklin . In the second

paragraph, Belmont states:

* A copy of said response is attached hereto at Tab.

Docld:32423556 Page 5
Inasmuch as the Dallas agents who listen-
ed to the tape of the conversation allegedly
of Oswald from the [deletion] and examined
the photographs of the visitor [deletion]
and were of the opinion that neither the
tape nor the photograph pertained to Oswald. ...
On November 25, 1963--some two days after Dallas cabled the
Bureau that the tapes had been erased--Bureau supervisor
Burt Turner cabled legat stating:
If tapes covering any contacts subject
with Soviet or Cuban embassies available
forward to Bureau for laboratory examination
“and analysis together with transcript.
Include tapes previously reviewed Dallas
if they were returned to you.
As noted. previously, Legat replied later that day to the effect
that the tapes had been erased.
It is unclear as to how Shanklin learned on November 23,
1963, that the Oswald tape had been erased. CIA documents

Fy

reflect that it was not until after 5 p.m. on November 23, 1963,
that Agency headauarters cabled its station in Mexico City

~ inquiring as to whether the original tapes were available.
David Phillips recalls that this inquiry precipitated CIA sta-
tion's search for the tapes which confirmed the fact that they
had been erased. Agency headquarters was so informed on November
24, 1963,

Neither Gordon Shanklin nor Elbert Rudd [the Special Agent

then assigned to Legat, Mexico, who personally delivered the

alleged Oswald photograph to Dallas on November 22, 1963] recall

ever having been aware of a tape recording (alleged or otherwise)

Re: References to FBI Review of. Tapes of Oswald's October 1, 1963
Mexico City Conversation .

On February 19, 1976, the staff received a November 23,
1963, Bureau memorandum which Hoover forwarded to President
Johnson under cover letter of even date explaining that the

memorandum set forth "the results of the Bureau's inquiry into

\

the assassination of President Kennedy and background infor-
mation relative to Lee Harvey Oswald."* In relevant part the

memorandum states:
The CIA advised that on October 1, 1963,

an extremely sensitive source had reported

that an individual identified himself as

Lee Oswald, who contacted the Soviet Embassy

in Mexico City inquiring as to any messages.

Special Agents of this Bureau, who have con-

versed with Oswald in Dallas, Texas, have

observed photographs of the individual referred

to above, and have listened to a recording of

his voice. These special agents are of the

opinion that the above-referred-to individual

was not Lee Harvey Oswald.

You are aware of the significance of this language. You are

also aware that the stated position of ‘the CIA --as reflected in the
testimony of David Phillips and contemvoraneous CIA cables -- has alweys
been that the actual tape recording of this conversation was erased

sometime in October of 1963. s

* A copy of this memorandum is attached at Tab. On February 2,
1976, the Bureau delivered us. a copy of a 11/25/63 Legat Cable-
gram which is attached at Tab, along with the more complete
version that was furnished to us on February 24. You will note
that the references to the Oswald tapes and their erasure on
page two of the cablegram were deleted from the copy we first
received.
