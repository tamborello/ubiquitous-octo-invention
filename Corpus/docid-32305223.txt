instructions are relayed te members or other persons by word of
mouth, FRANK BALISTRIERI claimed that this procedure is now going
on all over the United States among- the several LCN families.

. '-* FRANK BALISTRIERI also stated te these other members
that guys like MARSHALL CAIFANO recently pled guilty to federal
charges in Chicago, Illinois (FBI - ITSP case) to protect other
hoodlum leaders there. Informant pointed out that this is contrary
to-usual procedure in the past whereby family members would not
enter guilty pleas. In this instance informant also pointed out
that CAIFANO was probably playing for a concurrent federal i
sentence to run with a state conviction in California for which

he has to serve time, : Se, 4

in the past the Milwaukee family and particularly the boss, FRANK
BALISTRIERI, has been receiving orders from Chicago and has been
considered under the direction of the Chicago family, Informant

explained that. there is speculation among the soldiers in.
‘Milwaukee that Chicago is probably having. to make changes. due to
the convictions of family leaders there which would necessarily
cause considerable disruption im the Chicago family. Therefore,
it is possible that both Chicago and Milwaukee are having to —
‘seek direction and orders from New York City as far as family
leadership is concerned. Informant acknowledged that this is
‘strictly talk or discussion and not to be considered fact,

Milwaukee will advise further in the event the
informant obtains any substantiation or additional pertinent
information concerning the above matters, - :

furnished reliable information in the past, : . .
