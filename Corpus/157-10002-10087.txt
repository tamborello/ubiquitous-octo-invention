‘cers whose objective would be to plan for the overthrow of

the Castro regime. .

Mr. Smothers. Was it your understanding that these
plans were to extend to assassination? |
Mr. Halpern. That word was not lused, sir. But no

holds were barred, and we had no Limitation.
Mr. Smothers.Let me ask you it arjother way. What was
your understanding of what Mr. Bissell jhad been told to do
by the President and the Attorney General?
Mr. Halpern. To get rid of Castro and the Castro regime
on the Island of Cuba.
Mr. Smothers. Did Mr. Bissell convey to you the idea
that that included killing Castro?
Mr. Halpern. The subject never came up per se.
Mr. Smothers. What did you come away from that meeting
expecting to do?
Mr. Halpern. We were very hard put to come upwwith
any real ideas. We didn't know what to ido, frankly. And we

went back ~= one thing we both agreed on,

 

I, is that we were not going to come up with a piece of
paper which said this was going to be easy or could be done

overnight, or could be done with mirrors.

 

The Chairman. Did you come away after your conversation

with Mr. Bissell with the idea that he had instructed you
1

to come up with a plan of some kind designed to overthrow,
