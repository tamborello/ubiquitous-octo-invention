For 1 (Type of Action),m enter "B", scheduled records.
For 5A (Description of Records), please enter the following:

"On 11 May 1992, CIA delivered to NARA a small 124-page package which
included originals of many of the documents and redacted copies of the others which
constituted the entire collection of documents held by CIA in its 201 File on Lee
Harvey Oswald as of 23 November 1963. (In CIA's first submission of copies of the
contents of this pre-assassination file to the Warren Commission in early 1964, CIA
was not yet ready to release in full its own documents and, therefore, replaced them -
with a memoranduin summarizing them but protecting sources and methods.) We are
now transferring an updated version which differs from our May 1992 submission in
four ways: All of the third-agency documents which were lightly sanitized in the May
version are hereby released in full; all of the Agency documents are hereby released in
much less redacted form; the summary memorandum submitted to the Warren
Commission (but composed in early 1964) is hereby released in full; and the original
file folder is hereby released in full."

For 5B, enter “one irich."

; For 5C, we judge that thePrivacy Act does not apply to the sanitized or declassified
parts of these records which we are turning over, insofar as CIA equities are concerned.

For 5D, there are no restrictions on this submission, and any CIA equities contained
herein are released.

For 5D, this submission is a part of Records Schedule No. 40-76, Part B, Item 1.c(1).
