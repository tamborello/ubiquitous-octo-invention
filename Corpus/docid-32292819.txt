MEX 92-13

Subject en route tried to offer money to secure
his release. He was taken to the Offices of Mexican
Immigration in Mexico City and asked for his tourist
card or passport and how he entered the country. He had
no papers or documents and said that he flew in from
Laredo, Texas, but they were unable to find any record
of this. Since he had no papers and apparently was
illegally in Mexico, it was decided to report just that he-
had no lan and his deportation was arranged on the same
date. y

. Source was certain that subject's attorney, CASTILLO,
was in Mexico City at the time but was unable to do anything
to stop the deportation. ) \

| Subject''s deportation from Mexico was the source of

considerable comment and speculation on the part of acquaintances
in Mexico such as the card and golf playing group around

his Mexican attorney, JORGE CASTILLO. Repo#tedly CASTILLO

claims that he was not in Mexico at the time of the deportation

.. and that if he had been in Mexico he could have averted it.

SS The speculation was that subject would still have been

if forced to leave Mexico but could have chosen a destination

/ other than the United States, such as Paris. There were

two further fields of speculation concerning the deportation.

One is to the effect that the failure of CASTILLO or his

associates to avert this action must have the effect of

: putting CASTILLO in very bad graces with the subject who has 4

j undoubtedly been paying him a substantial retainer. A A

second speculation is to the effect that CASTILLO himself

may have arranged for this action because subject's presence

in Mexico was a cause of embarrassment to CASTILLO, who s

has a number of wealthy and important clients and whose : i

business largely depends on good contacts within the Mexican

Government. Shortly before deportation one of CASTILLO'S

children married the son of a high governmental official. and i

there was a huge reception at the Churubusco Golf Club. i

Subject reportedly was in attendance and his presence there

was commented by other guests. .In spite of this, CASTILLO

reportedly has spoken about holding a big celebration to wel-

come the subject should he return to Mexico, There was py 4
