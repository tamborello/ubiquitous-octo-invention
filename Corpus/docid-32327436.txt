Mr. REED COZART was contacted on February 8,
1961 for information concerning SNYDER. At that time,
COZART advised that SNYDER had contacted him at his office
sometime in the latter part of January, 1961. During this
contact, SNYDER discussed two individuals by the names of
PERIERA and BRADING., COZART stated that SNYDER gave him
the impression that he was a big shot in San Diego who was
working on a deal to redaim desert land in Nevada. The
above two individuals were to be instrumental in completing
the deal to reclaim this land, and it was absolutely essential
that they be released from their parole to travel extensively
in the west in order to complete this deal.

COZART stated he had furnished SNYDER certain
papers to be filled out by PERIERA and BRADING. These papers
were applications for Executive Clemency. SNYDER airmailed
these papers to PERIERA and BRADING and approximately three
days later brought them to COZART's office. COZART stated
that he is a Pardon Attorney in the U. S. Department of
JuBtice and acts on Executive Clemency Appeals, however,
he flatly denied the appeals from PERIERA and BRADING and
told SNYDER that these two individuals would have to seek
relief from their local parole officers and that his office
could not help them.
