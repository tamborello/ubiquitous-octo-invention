RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended the Bureau initiate steps to
have the Legat, Rome determine whether or not an interview
of TANCREDI TORTORA, aka., could be conducted in Italy;
the circumstances under which it could be conducted: and whether
or not a Bureau Agent other than the Legat could assist in
the interview or be present or closely available during the
interview. ,

It would be desirable if the. interview and the
subject matter could be maintained in a confidential manner
as TORTORA's life could possibly be endangered. For
security reasons it might be desirable to conduct the interview
at some other location away from TORTORA 's home town.

 

 

The Los Angeles Office recommends that when arrangements
for an interview have been completed the Bureau authorize i
SA HAROLD F. DODGE to participate, if possible, in
the conducting of the interview.

There are several factors indicating TORTORA will
cooperate in this key interview. For example, according to
LA 4u48-c-TE, in the late 1920s the close relationship between
TORTORA and ROSELLI was already deteriorating. Thereafter,
they developed separate interests and the close relationship
never again existed. As noted above, ROSELLI has, through
the years, indicated distrust of TORTORA. Several years ago
informant received a letter from TORTORA for ROSELLI in which
he expressed financial need and made a request for money.
ROSELLI told informant he was ignoring the letter and
refusing to send any money and again expressed his distrust

of TORTORA and his concern that TORTORA might cooperate with
authorities and expose his past. This concern is well
founded, for, as noted above, TORTORA is in possession of
highly compromising information concerning ROSELLI's past.

 

 

 

 

; Therefore, in view of the above and considering the
fact that the Italian Police will be able to exert some
persuasion on TORTORA, there is a logical basis to believe
that TORTORA might cooperate with the Bureau. It is felt
that this critical interview should be conducted utilizing .
the element of surprise. As TORTORA speaks English, it is

On March 4, 1964, LA 4448-C-TE who is an admitted
member of La Cosa Nostra and for many years a known, friend
and associate of ROSELLI, first furnished information that
ROSELLI was a member. of the Chicago "Brugad" of La Cosa Nostra i
and one of the most powgr and influential members of this
organization. Informa so stated that ROSELLI's true
name is FILIPO (Philip}ASACCO; that he was born in Caserta,
Italy about 60 years do

     
    

aa
and that he was brought to the we epmon / ak
“Gnited States by his parents when he was a young boy. He “~~ oe
said that ROSELLI has observed unusual precautions to guard i
the secret of his birth. :

Investigation has verified the fact that FILIPO
SACCO was born in Italy and came to the United States with
hig mother when a small boy. He attended school in Boston, _
Massachusetts, leaving school in November , 1917. In May , 1923 vA

Chicago newspaper stories of the death of TONY CHARLANDO
(for which TORTORA was charged) state that TONY CHARLANDO and
five of his. "gang" heavily armed, went to the home of his
brother CHARLES CHARLANDO and that this was the culmination
of a feud between the two brothers. During the ensuing fight
CHARLES and TONY CHARLANDO and a thirdman, who endeavored to
assist CHARLES, were wounded. Several days later TONY died.
Shortly after the shooting, five men were arrested in the
—~vieinity. The names of these five men were not idéntitcal to
any~of_the known aliases of TORTORA or ROSELLI. However, it
y is noted that TORTORA was charged with this murder so was
: probably ene of the five men arrested.

 

— ‘ "te Journal", a Chicago newspaper which merged
in the "Chicago Daily News", in its issue of April 29, 1922,
relates that TONGREDE TORTORA was arrested at his soft drink
parlor in Chicago and a quantity of opium, cocaine and morphine
were found. Two men and two women were also arrested. The
men arrested were RALPH STORTOTO, age 21 and GERONA DURANDO,
age 30. . :

No record of the shooting of TONY CHARLANDO or the
nartocics arrest of TANGREDE TORTORA has yet been located in
the Chicago Police Department files. The fingerprints of
ROSELLI were searched through Chicago Police Department files
with negative results. :

 

Assuming that ROSELLI was one of the five men involved
in the CHARLANDO shooting and/or was one of the two men
arrested on the narcotics charge with TORTORA, it is logical
to speculate that he had the Chicago Police Department record
purged. This becomes more logical in view of LA 4WNB-C-TE's
statement that ROSELLI showed him a police department photograph
of himself. and TORTORA taken when they were young men and
that ROSELLI is a member of the Chicago "Brugad" and no
doubt had access to contacts in the Chicago Police Department.

In view of the above it is apparent that TORTORA
has knowledge concerning ROSELLI's activities which is
vital to the continued investigation of ROSELLI's past. He
is the only person known and. may be the only person living
who knows this information. If he would talk he could
possibly. furnish information which would enable the Bureau
to bring this investigation to a logical conclusion either

by furnishing information to link ROSELLI to a prosecutable
crime or deportation as an alien.

‘ ‘

 

The Legat in Rome has furnished information

that TANCREDI TORTORA currently resides on Corso Italin
_Street, Acerra, Italy and is a dealer in fruits and vegetables
with his brothers PARIGI and COMIZIO. He is single, reportedly
in good health and since his deportation to Italy has not

been known to engage in any suspect activities and hasnot

come to police attention. It was not possible to determine

if he is now or has been affiliated with La Cosa Nostra.

TANCREDI's nephew,. CARMINE TORTORA, son of PARIGI,
is a graduate of the U. S. Naval Academy ‘and now an officer
in the U. S. Navy. . 7 an
Nearly a year has gone by since LA 4448-c-TE
originally furnished the information concerning ROSELLI. :
it is the opinion of the Los Angeles Office that an interview
t of TORTORA’ could now be conducted without unduly jeopardizing
: the informant. : -

; The interview of TORTORA is an extremely critical
and important step in the ROSELLI investigation. It should’

‘ be well thought out and planned. It should be thorough and
tO ~ exhaustive. To accomplish this, the person conducting the ~
interview should have‘knowledge, or have readily available
knowledge of ROSELLI's complete history, background, and
“activities as the Bureau knows them. Such knowledge would
suggest lines of questioning which might not otherwise be
apparent. It would assist _in discerning if TORTORA was .
telling the truth and in general would tend to make the interview
more productive. '

The Los Angeles Office for more than seven years
‘has, under the Criminal Intelligence Program, conducted,an
intensive investigation into the background, history and
activities of ROSELLI. It is a complex case involving
numerous associates and varied activities. During all of
this period the ROSELLI case has been assigned to SA HAROLD
F. DODGE who is familiar with all phases of the investigation.
