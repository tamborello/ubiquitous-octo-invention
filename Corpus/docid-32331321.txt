LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISES

 

By letter to the Bureau dated February 1, 1966,
Washington Field requested the Legat, London, Engiand to conduct
investigation to determine whether JOSEPH FRANCIS NESLINE, :
CHARLES TOURINE and DINO VINCENT CELLINI are licensed for em- 4
ployment in any gambling establishment or are registered as owner U) |
or part-owner of any gambling establishment in London, England. (U
|

By letter dated March 15, 1966, Legat, London advised f
that the above request was- furnished. to Criminal Intelligence _
Squad Officers, New Scotland Yard. The names of NESLINE, TOURINE !
and CELLINI were known to the Criminal Intelligence Unit and !
information now developed from an informant of one of the police {fy
officers who has connections in the gambling casinos, indicates . 4
that at the moment TOURINE and NESLINE are looking for a club () |
in which to invest, but have not yet located one. This informant
also states that while CELLINI is a skilled trainer of croupiers
he has had little or no experience, at least in London, of
managing or running a gambling club.

NY T--7, on April 28, 1966, stated that JOSEPH FRANCIS
NESLINE has a substantial interest in the Colony Club in ;
London, England, and has left the operation of this club to
DINO CELLINI. This source further indicated that CHARLES
TOURINE owns the Friar's Club in. London, England, but the
source has been unable to determine who is operating this
club for TOURINE.

 

 

 

NY T-1 on May 25, 1966, stated that neither NESLINE
or TOURINE actually own a piece of any gambling clubs in London,
but are trying to get connected with them. In addition, TOURINE
supposedly has hired lawyers who are trying to get him permission
to enter England.
