MORA told informants that the only way OSWALD could

trip to the Soviet Union. -She was very interested in ;
obtaining information concerning the date OSWALD departed for
Russia. MORA considered it "terribly important" to have any
press references to OSWALD's activities in New Orleans before’
he went to Russia, She stated that if something regarding
his activities at that time appeared in the press it could
"blow the lid and we could ali get fried." MORA indicated to

Mexican officials.

Imbassy, which would select the proper official to handle the {

interview, and this office cculd cooperate closely with him,

 

a | . |
A It is suggested also that an Agent of this office 4
sit in with the Embassy official during the interview to i

insure that the Bureau's interests are protected and pertin-
ent points covered. It is believed that SMOLIKOFP, as an
American citizen, would respond to a request from the Embassy
to appear at the Embassy for an interview. ;

  

For the protection offfaex-18 and MEX-19
suggested that the predication rp the interview Be ‘that !
several American Communists who have visited Mexico, when
returning to the United States, have stated that SMOLIKOFF
had been of assistance to them in many ways and that the
January, 1964, National Guardian-tour was entertained by hin;

sconsequently, it was desired to determine whether or not S|
OSWALD had contacted him or visited his store. In the event :
fa Ou EOE *F claims that he was not in Mexico City when OSWALD a4
in this area, it is felt that the interviewer could point |

  

 

; to him that the airline records show that he left for i
Rew York: on 9/14/63 and returned on American Airlines 9/29/64 !
ane that the airline menifests do not show any other travel '
by him in the period prior to 10/3/63. It is felt this

Appeo ch would direct attention away from effective informants
of this office.

SMOLTKOPE to visitigps American Conmynists, this matter again . :
was Gistussed with€Mey-13 and six fon 5/5/64, <fhe informants wT)

in which they are interested. SMALL helps them make
