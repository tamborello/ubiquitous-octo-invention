FRANK ANNUNZIO, operater of the Lake Personnel Service
and Democratic Ward Committeeman of the First Ward of Chicago in
1944 and State Director of Labor for the State of Illinois wader
Governoy ADLAI STEVENSON, was interviewed on 1/23/62 by GAs HILL ~

: seliciting his cooperation in view of the fact that ke,
ANNUNZIO, was a wellerespected Italian businessman and leader
of several Italian civic groups. He is the Chairman of the
Villa Scalabrini Old Peoples Home and is Director of the Italian

interviewing Agents as to “why is GIROLAMI in the position he is
in today? 1°11 tell you why.. He-.was tapped on the shoulder

Italian-American politician hand picked by the syndicate to
lock efter their affairs. GIROLAMT, who is CG 6498-PC, contacted
SA ROEMER immediately after D°ARCO advised him that ANNUNZIO
