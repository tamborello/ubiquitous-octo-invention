1. (U) Per your request, attached is a memorandum

that no further action from the Inspector Generals office is
required, and that this matter may be considered closed.

The Office of Information Management/Historical Review Group
(OIM/HRG) will notify the Assassination Review Board (ARB)
.and file a copy of this memorandum in HRG files to refer to

when writing the compliance letter to the ARB.

3. {AIUO) It is also understood that original —
documents are not required when material is requested ‘for or...
being added to the sequestered collection, and that copies
of the material which were inadvertently destroyed were
previously provided to the HSAC and ARB (or special task
force) before their destruction in 1995.

4. (ATIUO) With the assistance of HRG, the OIG/IMO has
been able to reconstruct the file and will maintain it as a
permanent record, also adding a copy of the attached to that
file.

26 November 1997

TO: Rick Cinquegrana, D/IG/INV™
AD/IG/INV
FROM: (C), OIG/IMO

 

SUBJECT: (AIUO) Possible Illegal Destruction of Records

1. (AIUO) The OIG/IMO received a request from the
AD/IG/INV to search for records needed to verify certain
nominees. During the course of this search, the IMO
discovered what appeared to be the inadvertent destruction
of permanent OIG records.

2. {(AIUO) The records, cases from 1977, were retired
in 1980. See exhibit A for a copy of the original records
retirement request.

3. (C) When form 140 (exhibit A) was approved by the
Agency Archives and Records Center (AARC) and returned with
a job number (80-01770R), the records were prepared in
folders, placed in boxes, and a shelflist was created (see
exhibit B for shelflist).

4. (ATIUO) Please take notice of the highlighted
portion of the shelflist that claims the records disposition
as ‘permanent’. This along with the use of the terminology
‘case no.', led me to believe these were permanent records.

5.  (AIUO) Exhibit C is a completed request (form

141b) from AARC for authority to destroy these records. All

of the records. except those listed on a. handwritten note
(exhibit D) attached to form 141b were destroyed.

6. (AIUO) At this point, I referred to the original
form 140 (exhibit A) to determine what Records Control
Schedule (RCS) and Item Number was used to retire these
records in 1980. I ordered a copy of the old. RCS 07-76 and
checked the disposition of item number ‘3b’ (see highlighted
section of exhibit E). The disposition does allow for the
lawful destruction of these temporary. records.

SUBJECT: (AIUO) Possible Illegal Destruction of Records

7. -(ATUO) I then noticed that the destruction
authorization form 141b (exhibit C) listed the RCS as 10-84
and the Item Number as 29B. Referring to the newer :version
of the RCS I found that this schedule and item number also
allow for the lawful destruction of these temporary records.
Please see the highlighted text of exhibit F.

8, (AIUO) At this juncture, I reviewed the material
and noticed a note on exhibit D that stated, “IG 37/77
Lonnquist (Kennedy Assassination) destroyed on 5/1/95 by
S.K.”%. : ‘

9. (AIUO) Please see the attached JFK Assassination
Act (exhibit G), para (a) (1) thru (6). In short, this law
was enacted in 1992 and these records were destroyed in
1995. The fact the records were scheduled as temporary and
then destroyed according to Agency regulations does ‘not
override Public Law'102-526, the JFK Assassination Act.

10. (AIUO) TI found three entries in Textware on
Lonnquist. . Two pertain to nothing of interest in this case;
however the third entry states, “allegations regarding the
Lee Harvey Oswald file” (see the highlighted text of exhibit
H).

11. (AIUO) In May 1997, I told the JFK Assassination
Review Board (ARB), in an informal hearing, that OIG had no
knowledge or record of any JFK records under OIG’s perview
being destroyed. This was during discussions at the table,
and not one of the listed questions for the OIG/IMO to
answer. .

12. (AIUO) My plan is to contact the DCI/IMO, enlist
his assistance in notifying the National Archives and
Records Administration (NARA) and the ARB that records
pertaining to the JFK Assassination were inadvertently
destroyed and explain in detail the events surrounding the
discovery and what steps have been taken to prevent this
from happening again.

13. (AIUO) I personally doubt that there was anything
of value to the ARB in the Lonnquist case file, but, because
LHO is referenced it is considered a JFK ARB file, and. by
law I have to report its destruction to NARA and the ARB.
