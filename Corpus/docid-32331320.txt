— On February 16, 1966, NY 3610-C-TE advised
Special Agents CHARLES G. DONNELLY and PAUL G. DURKIN,
that as, yet he has not obtained the telephone number of

CHARLIE: {WHITES telephone answering service, but expects

to in the ve near future, _ y
: y OSEVIASTBSSAATR.

In conversation with the informant, WHITE told
him that JOE STASSI's son, JOSEPH, JR,, was arrested because
of a lette?? which was found in his apartment. However,
WHITE said that as yet STASSI has not been caught. [It is
obvious that WHITE does not know that STASSI was apprehended
several weeks ago in Miami, Elorida.,

For some weeks, WHITE has been requesting the
informant to install a gadget on his telephone so that he
will be able to record all of his ‘incoming and outgoing
telephone calls. Informant has stalled WHITE, but said that
eventually, at his insistence, he may put the device on his
telephone. According to the informant, this device acts as
a transmitter, which means that all of his conversations
would be broadcast and monitored by the use of the gadget,
as the informant referred to as a "freak". It is pointed
out that the agents did not request this procedure and it
was further stated to the informant that they were not
interested in utilizing a "freak" in order to monitor any
of WHITE's telephone conversatinns.

Periodic spot checks of subject's residence during
the investigative period were made by SAS PAUL G. DURKIN and
CHARLES G, DONNELLY.

Information from the NY Telephone Company was made
available by OSKAR G,. DANIELSON, Security Supervisor, NYC.

In.a separate communication, leads to identify and
interview subscribers residing in offices not receiving this
report have previously been set out.
