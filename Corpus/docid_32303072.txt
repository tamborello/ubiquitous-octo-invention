“PG 92-277

Continuing liaison with the police departments of Richland and
West Deer Townships, which cover the neighborhood surrounding
the GENOVESE residence at Gibsonia, Pa., has reflected that

no new information concerning GENOVESE has been developed.

The Pittsburgh Office is presently reviewing and re-evaluating
its major hoodlum investigation in'an effort to ascertain

the actual financial holdings of this subject. Constant
checks are being made in this regard, keeping in mind that an
estimate of the net worth of a major hoodlum such as MIKE
‘GENOVESE, based upon his scale of living, will be invaluable
not only for uncovering heretofore unknown sums of money,

but for dissemination to the local office, of the Internal
Revenue Service as an aid to that agency's investigative
efforts. This information will be evaluated for comparison
with the suggested agenda of the Apalachin meeting to
determine whether the transactions are in any way coincidental.

There has been no new information coming to the attention of
Pittsburgh agents, through informants or sources, which would
indicate that the Apalachin meeting was held for anything other
than those purposes listed under Section E of referenced
| Albany airtel. :

had obtained it that same day from MIKE GENOVESE, that
at the meeting it was agreed to build a string of motels across
the country and local representatives of the group were to
pegin construction in their territories. The group at
Apalachin would be called upon for any financial aid needed
in this regard. At this same time GENOVESE reportedly advised
TIANI that he and his partner, ARCHIE NELSON, also a Pittsburgh
top hoodlum, had plans to build a motel at Monroeville, Pa.

MIKE GENOVESE was contacted by SA ROBERT A. VOEGE on 5/29/58- 3
at. which time he advised that inasmuch as he had little
education compared to that of a FBI Agent he would consent to
an interview only int the presente of his lawyer, VINCENT CASEY
of Pittsburgh. He admitted that he was "shook up" over the
investigation which has centered around him to date and he

does not believe he has done anything wrong to warrant such

an investigation. He admitted that he was at Apalachin,

New York, on 11/14/57, but stated he "didn't know what it

was all about." He said that he wishes now he had never been
