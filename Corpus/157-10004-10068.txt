However, the Inspector General's Report of 1973 (First pages of
Senators' White Book) contains a two-page summary of ZRRIFLE describing
its purpose as an Executive Action operation. It alleges (with no
reference as to source) that:

“'~he White House’ urged Richard Bissell to create an
Executive Action capability; i.e., a general stand-by
capability to carry out assassinations. The Executive
Action program came to be known as ZRRIFLE. Its principal
asset was an agent, QJWIN, who had been recruited earlier
by , for use in a special operation in the Congo
(the assassination of Patrice Lumumba)...."

Summary Chronology

 

ummary

ZRRIFLE is ostensibly a program to rectruit criminals for teams
hich could break into §iGmewenwenpaseneamiccmsteaeicode’s. However,
here is evidence in the files that this purpose, though useful to
he Agency, was in reality a cover for another operation. From other
ources, it appears that the real purpose was at least kidnapping and
ossibly murder.

 
 

ZRRIFLE was run out of the [ejpeoloees) counterintelligence shop
D Pin the Bureau of Forman Intelligence. It began sometime
nm late $60/early-1961 and lasted until at least mid-1963, although
‘ayments to its principal agent QJWIN were continued into 1964.

  
 
  

ZRRIFLE appears to have been part. a: a larger set of programs
Weerres'-the files indicate FAaMNcORNjand gZRRNGRENE: The
s aof these programs are unknown. quWIN was also in a category
feents which included at least one other SOUBARNERS who in fact

The principal events in the chronology are set forth below, but
she major phases were:

Congo allegedly for a kidnap or assassination of Lumumba.

--1961-1962 - QJWIN becomes contract employee. Seeks out
potential candidates ¢ oye ia eae in . Possible
more permanent assignment to Leopoldville under considera-
tion but finally dropped.

 

 

--1963 - While supposedly establishing cover fit man
in minimal contact with case officer, QJWIN apparently
meets Wm. Harvey in Florida in April and engages in some
kind of operation involving a boat.

HW 50955 Bocld:32201957 Page 3

 
This 1s apparently based on 1967 CIA Study which states that
Harvey said that early in the Kennedy Administration

 

"Bissell called him in to discuss what Harvey refers
to as an Executive Action Capability, i.e., a general
stand by capability to carry out assassinations when
required. Harvey's notes quote Bissell as saying
‘the White House has twice urged me to create such a
capability.'"

It should also be noted that ZRRIFLE was not a covert action but
was conducted under the aegis of counterintelligence--for which no
formal mechanisms of high-level review appear to exist, even today.)
