SUBJECT: Whereabouts and Current Activities of Luis CONTE Aguero.

le On the afternoon of 12 February, called the Anthony Abraham
Chevrolet agency (on Sv 8th St and LeJuene Avenue, Miami,
tel: 444-3561) and asked the operator to speak with Subject.
Ky call was transferred to a secretary who said he was
“around, but stepped out 4 minute." She asked if he could
‘geturn my call, but I said I would call back later.

“2, Minutes after, I called Alberto BEGUIRISTAIN, a salesman

 

with Anthony Abraham. (Since Ce July 1974, I have been in 08.27
loose contact with Alberto,: Hqs and .
had expressed an interest in assisting his mother obtain

a US non immigrant visa when and if she received a temporary
permit from the GOC to visit Alberto.) Under the quise of
inquiryirg about his mother {she is still inside hoping for

an exit permit) and offéring to send him my new PO Box, I
discreetly inquired if Subject still worked there. AFFIRMATIVE
was his answer. In fact, he wanted to qet him to the phone,
thinking I wanted to talk tc him. I thanked him but said

I would probably come by another day to see him. I asked him
not to comment my call with Subject and he agreed.
