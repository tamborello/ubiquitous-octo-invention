Bolivia Calm but Political Maneuvering Goes On

Bolivia is generally calm despite the continuing
roundup of leftist labor leaders.

The move of troops into the mines will apparently
occur in a day or so. Co-Presidents Barrientos and
Ovando are still discussing implementation of the
government's mine reorganization decree with delega-

; . tions of miners, and efforts to sell the government

i program seem to have achieved some success. The
miners are still well armed, however, and could start
further trouble.

Despite their public display of ccoperativeness,
Barrientos and Ovando are almost “httachgecent at

 

odds. Barrientos toldfthe US Air AttachéMéecently
that after the mine problem was settled, Ovando should
take a well-earned rest in Spain -- perhaps as ambas-—
sador. Barrientos: also seems to be building up bhi
own strongman within the army -- he frequently empha-
sizes his trust in the Chief of Staff, Col Vasquez.
