Father MC FADDEN advised that from conversations with
crew members of the ARGENTINE, he ascertained that the Greek
ship HARIKLIA from Piraeus, was in the process of unloading
sugar from Cuba and planned to take back a load of coal to
Cuba. He indicated that a Greek crewman stated that a Cuban
ship located further up the dock planned to take a large
shipment of Soviet trucks to Cuba. These’ trucks are clearly
visible in Father MC FADDEN's slides. Father MC FADDEN stated
that when the sugar was unloaded by the Greeks it was placed
under heavy tarpaulin approximately eight feet high and extended
for one-quarter mile up the wharf. He stated he observed the
sugar being loaded into boxcars for transmittal by rail.

Father MC FADDEN added that in conversation with
Captain SIMMONS of the ARGENTINE, he ascertained. that several
members of a Cuban ship further up the dock had attempted to
make contact with members of the American crew but were stopped
from doing so -by the Russian Soviet Security Forces at the dock.

Father MC FADDEN stated that he did not particularly
wish to be identified as furnishing these photographs but that
if it were necessary for another agency to further interrogate
him concerning the pictures, he would be glad to do so.

It should be noted that Father MC FADDEN is an established

source of the Philadelphia Office and materially assisted this
office in research material regarding Communism and the Communist

Party philosophy in connection with the trial of Dr. ALBERT EMANUEL

BLUMBERG in Philadelphia in 1956.

Father MC FADDEN was thanked for furnishing thése
slides and assured that they would be returned to him promptly.
