10, Subject concluded the interview with some of his opinions
and observations concerning the state of public morale in Cuba today.
He pointed out that much of the population, the “better people" of
the country, understood the United States position on Cuba. (The
implication being the reason for United States {fnilure to take direct
action or intervention in Cuba.) He said the people understand that
CASTRO is their own doing and that the United States cannot be held
responsible for his presence. He described the greater part of the
populace as sick and tired, undernourished, disgusted with blatant
propaganda lies, terrorized by repression but ultimately disposed to
resist at all costs. That if arms were generally available among the
populace, especially rifles and ammunition for them, CASTRO. would have
been overthrown by now, without a bit of outside help. That the farme
and some city folk, in desperation, leave their homes to join the
guerrilla bands with no hope for supply and many times turned down by
guerrilla leaders who cannot supply their own band as it is. Subject
departed with the reminder that the “Cubans traditionally prefer to
live good or not live at ali."
