On Kaach's second visit the landlady informed him that
LHO had moved to Dallas. Kaach said that he.then trans-
ferred the security case to the Dallas field office.

Leap ask Kaach: if he was censored by the FBI for
the manner in which he handled the LHO security investigation.
Kaach said he was not censored. Kaach said he retired
rather than be transferred to Springfield and the transfer
was not related to the LHO investigation.

Kaach said that he was certain the LHO was not a
security informant for the N.O. office.. As S/A assigned
the LHO security investigation, he would have been advised

if LHO was an informant.
