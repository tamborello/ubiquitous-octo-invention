due to a difference of opinion with two other members, (74) ile was

to lack of production and his obvious desire to break contact, (74) (75)

International Workers Movement (INM), Jater contact indicated that JARDON
suspected he was in contact with a WOLADY Intelligence Service.) (76)
In 1961 JARDON became Director of Prensa Latina (PL) in
Mexico City, In 1967 he was dismissed from this pesition by Orlando :
FUNDORA Lopez, Cuban General Director of PL, It is believed that his : .

became Director of Politica, which was on the verge of closing down in
- September 1967, again leaving JARDON jobless.
