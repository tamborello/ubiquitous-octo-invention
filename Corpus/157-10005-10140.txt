to the threatening aspects of Castro's interview (Tab 2). There are
attached a number of statements made by Castro and other Cuban leaders

Office and OCI completed a thorough review of relevant files (Tab 3).

4. Our records contain no direct information that any foreign
government or foreign group was considering possible assassination of
an American leader. However, it should be noted that on 9 January 1964

forwarded a duplicate copy of a raw report dated
5 Jaruary—1962, dealing with a year-end CPG cell meeting. At this
meeting the cell leader, Morse Benitez Zabola, told the cell members
that the CP in Guatemala should form a single new party. Benitez is
also noted as stating: ‘We need not preoccupy ourselves over the
politics of President Kennedy because we know, according to prognosti-
cation, that he will die within the present year (1962). It should be
noted that this item of raw reporting was received after the Kennedy
assassination. We have no indication thus far in the file as to whether
any action was taken on the item with the Warren Commission.

 

5. We have no indication in our records that there was any
communication to President Johnson regarding the matter dealt with by
this question. :
