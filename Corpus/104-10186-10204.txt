The following report is one of a series containing personality
information provided by the source and includes supplemental
information from the records of this Agency.

It is requested that the addressees take no action on any of
the individuals mentioned in the personality reports without

first checking with this Agency.

Upon further questioning of source, he revealed that the full
name of Armando, subject of the above referenced report, is Armando
TORRES Mesones, alias "El Francés." He is the curriculum administra-
tive officer in the Departamento Escuelas Especiates (Department of
Special Schools - EE), responsitle for guerrilla warfare training,
in the Direccion Genéral de Inteligencia (General Directorate of
Intelligence ~- DGI). Operations officers from the Departamento
de Liberacion Nacional (National Liberation Department -LN) of the
DGI send TORRES a statement as to what an individual agent, or
groups of agents, is expected to do upon returning to his native
country and TORRES arranges a training schedule which will prepare
each individual for his assignment; he decides how many hours of
instruction each trainee will have and in what subjects. In addition,
he arranges the schedules of the instructors in the various schools
and handles the overall administration for them. TORRES does not
teach courses himself although he ranks as the chief instructor. He
works particularly close with the Venezuelan desk officers and has
relatively less to do with other LN Department operations officers, 1
