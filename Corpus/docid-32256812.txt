The Honorable Harold Brown

Secretary of Defense

Dear Mr. Secretary:

On December 16, 1977, I wrote to Vice Admiral Inman of
the National Security Agency, requesting that certain members

. of the Committee staff be allowed access to data, if any, re-

lating to the assassination of President Kennedy, but particu-
larly relating to the Cuban Intelligence network of Premier
Castro, with emphasis on operations by Cuban Intelligence
operatives. A copy of that letter is enclosed for your informa-
tion. : : . .

Subsequent to this request, Professor G. Robert Blakey,

'-Chief Counsel to the Select Committee, had a number of conver-

“sations with your Special Assistant John Kester, in an effort ©

to set up a briefing by appropriate staff people from NSA. We
had hoped that this briefing could have taken place. prior to
the end. of March when Committee members and staff personnel
were to.be out of the country on matters relating to this re-
quest.

Nevertheless, a briefing was not arranged until May 15,
1978 at 1:00 p.m., over a month ago. The briefing was held,
as scheduled, but the content of it had nothing whatsoever to
do with our initial request. We have been waiting. since that
time for another briefing to be set up. What we have received
is one short, hardly adequate, letter saying essentially that
no information is possessed relative to the President's
assassination.

It is the Committee's feeling that to pursue this matter

in the future as we have in the past would be a futile effort
on our part.
