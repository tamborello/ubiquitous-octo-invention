File No. July 3, 1968
VINCENZO MARTINEZ

; The following information was: made available :by Police
‘Headquarters, Italian.National Police, Palermo, Sicily, on June 26,
1968, and by the Consular ‘Section, U.. 8. Embassy,.Rome, Italy, on
July 2, 1968:

The trial of VINCENZGTARTINRZ and sixteen other persons
charged in Italy with .aggravatéd criminal .conspiracy resumed .on
June.14, 1968. After several hearings extending through June 22,
1968, which were devoted. to the arguments of the defendants!
attorneys, the court recessed until June 25, 1968.

On June 25, 1968, the court ruled that there was. in-
sufficient ‘evidence to sustain the charge of aggravated criminal
-conspiracy against .the defendants and ordered their release. ‘Two
of ‘the Italian nationals face :charges elsewhere and were sentenced
.to a period of obligatory sojourn.

Under Italian law. (Article 479 of the Italian Code of
Penal Procedure) the term "insufficienza di prove" (insufficiency
of evidence) is a qualified acquittal because it is ordered when
the evidence is inadequate to warrant a verdict of guilty; however ,
the inference remains that the trial.established elements of ‘guilt
which were offset by elements of innocence. Under Article 479
three other acquittal.verdicts were possible; (1) "Per non aver
commesso il fatto," meaning there was no evidence incriminating
the defendants or the evidence clearly established innocence.
(2) "Il fatto non costituisce reato," meaning the act committed
does not constitute a crime. .(3) "Il fatto non sussiste," meaning
there is no evidence that a crime has been. committed.

The Public Prosecutor has ‘appealed the court's decision;.
however, as of July 2, 1968, no ruling had been made on the appeal.

The interrogatories éxecuted by GERALD SHUR ‘of the U.S.

Department of Justice were not introduced into evidence at the
trial.
