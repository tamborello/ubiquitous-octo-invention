JFK Project - Status

CIA _JFK/Sequestered Collection:

T.Oswald 201

(4565 records/25,707 pages) - Complete
Tit. CIA/JFK Hardcopy (63 boxes)
HSCA (30,000 pages) - Complete
Boxes 1-12 (4565 record/22389 pages)- Complete

Boxes 13-63
: (26652 records/156,241 pages) - 65%+ Complete

To be re-reviewed: approximately 50,000 pages
[The ARRB staff designated “priority” folders in boxes 13-
63; the review of these folders is almost complete.]
III. CIA/Microfilm - Approximately 160,000 pages

To be re-reviewed - 80,000 pages

{1994 release plus newly designated Assassination
Records] ,

The remaining pages are either duplicates (Oswald 201-
26,000 pages) or are pending a decisions by the Board. At
its November and Decembers meetings, The ARRB is scheduled
(Nov./Dec. meetings) to act on proposals by the ARRB staff
to declare over 50,000 pages of the microfilm as “Not .
Believed Relevant.” The ARRB has agreed that duplicates do
not have to reviewed prior to 1 October 1998. .

New Assassination Records (to date)- To be reviewed.
DO working files - 40,000 pages
Security Files - 3,000 pages

We anticipate the number of new records to increase as the
ARRB staff continues its review of Agency files.
v

Referrals from other Agencies are increasing -
To be reviewed: At least 40,000 pages.

This is a rough estimate and could easily be higher. We
reviewed in August, September and October over 18,000 pages
compared with less than 10,000 the previous 7 months.

Declassification and Transfer to NARA:

The increase in assassination records plus the.
requirement to declassify and transfer to NARA all JFK
assassination records to NARA by 30 September 1998 will
require a significant increase in support resources
(indexing, redaction, reproduction). Currently most of the
indexing and reproduction for the project is done on
overtime. Two support ICs assist the reviewers with the
review and redaction tasks. To meet the deadline, I estimate
that the current cost of support will .double.

Resources: See previous memo.

The projected requirements are a rough estimate at this
time. They assume that HRG will have computer connectivity
with the CIA SCIF at ARRB offices and access to summer
employees (5) to assist with preparing documents for NARA
during June-Aug. 1998. The actual cost could increase
depending on the decisions by the Board on the NBR. proposals
and if number of referrals and new assassination records are
much higher than projected. ~

SUBJECT: CSI Resource Request regarding JFK

In Brian Latell’s absence, | am providing the following response to the Exdir's questions regarding the et for additional resources for
review of JFK documents: .

1. What is the size of the JFK declassification problem ? How.much work remains to be done ?

- An additional 40-50,000 pages of CIA records remain to be reviewed by 30 September
1998.

- A large volume of documents are being referred to CIA by other agencies for review,
including the FBI, State, and Presidential Libraries. . The documents are either ClA-originated
or contain CIA information. No figures are available, but we estimate at least 40,000 pages.

- The JFK Beard has also asked CIA to re-review approximately 130,000 pages of material that
we released earlier to the National Archives. The reason is to determine whether
information deleted earlier can now be released.
2. How many people do you have working on the JFK projectnow?

- Following are dedicated to the JFK project: _

-- One staff officer {Project leader Barry Harrelson}
“+13 independent contractors (work 3/4 days per week}

- The 00 unit detailed to CSI to coordinate the review of JFK records recently added two
contractors and may add more.

Lad

What difference would X more make ?

- The additional resources requested would allow us to increase the pace of the review of
CIA documents and third agency referrals. Unless the pace is increased, it is highly unlikely
that the Board's requirement te complete the review and declassification of all JFK-related
records by 30 September 1998 could be met.

Request for Additional Funds for the JFK Assassination
Records Review Project, through 31 September 1998.

Reference: Ltr. to Executive Director form J. Jeremy Gunn,
Executive Director, Assassination Records Review Board
(ARRB), copy attached.

Background.

1. The ARRB will go out of business on 31 September
1998. Before that date, it has a statutory obligation to
complete its review of all records held by the U.S.
Government which relate to the assassination of President
Kennedy, determine those which are relevant to the
assassination story and ensure that the same are transferred
to the National Archives. As the board begins its final
year, it has become increasingly concerned about the pace of
the review and transfer process. Referent letter is the
latest of a number of exchanges dealing with that concern.

2. CSI/HRG has carefully reviewed its current position
with respect to its ability to meet the deadlines imposed
and has concluded that it cannot fully do so without
additional resources, at least through 30 September 1998.
This conclusion is based in large measure on three changed
circumstances:

A. The ARRB has recently exercised its statutory
authority and designated additional CIA records to be within
the JFK collection (to date approximately twenty cubic feet
or 40,000 pages). Additional records may be identified as
the ARRB staff continues its review of Agency files.

B. Over the past three months we have received an
increase in the number of “Assassination Records” referred
from third agencies which include both Agency documents held
by another agency or third agency documents which must be
reviewed because they contain CIA information; and

Cc. The ARRB itself has established a deadline which was
not anticipated. All agencies had understood that the
review process and ARRB action would have to be completed by
30 September, but it was widely assumed that final
processing and transfer of the documents to the National
Archives could occur after that date. However, the Board has
now mandated that all relevant records which are not
duplicates must be transferred to custody of the National
Archives before it goes out of business.

Additional Resources Requested.

 

3. The following estimate is based on our understanding
of the ARRB requirements at this time.

A. Review of records: equivalent of 2 man-years (3

contractors -- average daily contractor cost
$270);

B. Preparation of documents for National Archives:
equivalent of 1.5 man-years (2 contractors --
average daily contractor cost $180);

C. Indexing: approximately one-man year of overtime
($25 hourly rate);

D. Reproduction: approximately one-man year of
overtime ($25 hourly rate).

Estimated cost FY98: $300,000
