Fact Sheet on March 27, 1978 Letter

This is in regard to the Committee's request for
the Navy camera used during the autopsy of President
Kennedy at the National Naval Medical Center on 22-23
November 1978. Based on information provided to Ms. Judy
Miller by the Select Committee staff as to the location
of Navy documentation pertaining to the autopsy camera
and lens, a thorough and diligent search was conducted
of the files at the National Naval Medical Center, and
the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Unfortunately, these
additional efforts have failed to reveal any records
stating the identity or location of the camera and lens
ih question.

“Et! is presumed that the camera previously provided

sto the Committee was the camera used at the autopsy; the
‘“caimera.Was described in a previous Committee request as a
emg x 5‘Graphic View type, and the camera provided to the

_ Committee was the only one of that description in use at
the Natidnal Naval Medical Center in 1963. The lens pro-
vided to, the Committee is a standard lens that was in use
at the Medical Center in 1963. Although other lenses were
also in use at the Medical Center during that time they
have been replaced. Furthermore, no records have been
located that indicate specifically which lens was used
during the autopsy, nor does the Navy hold any records
pertaining to the film holders used for the autopsy
photographs. It is likely that those holders have been
replaced due to normal wear and tear,

Fact Sheet on John David Hurt Request

In a letter dated March 13, 1978, the Defense
Department was requested to provide any documents it has
on a Mr. John David Hurt of Raleigh, North Carolina.
Subsequently the House Select Committee staff informed
the Department that Mr. Hurt was a member of the Army
Counterintelligence Corps during World War II.

The computerized index to the files in the National
Personnel Records Center indicates that a John David Hurt,
SSN 107-005-5407, born May 12, 1909, River Bend, Colorado,
enlisted in the Army on November 5, 1942, and was dis-
charged on December 28, 1945. His Army Service number was
14180986. The personnel file on Mr. Hurt, to which this
index entry pertained, was destroyed in the July 1973 fire
at the Center that destroyed 16.5 million files on Army
personnel who served before 1960. The Defense Department
has found no other information on Mr. Hurt. If he served
in Army intelligence, he would have had an intelligence
dossier on him, but such a filé would have been destroyed
before now: files of this sort containing derogatory
information on the subject of the file are destroyed after
25 years; files without derogatory information are
destroyed after 15 years.

Although the Defense Department has no further infor-
mation on Mr. Hurt, it may be able to aid the Committee
in verifying certain facts concerning Mr. Hurt's service
in the Army. If he served in Army intelligence, Mr. Hurt
would have been provided a badge number. If he can
remember this number, the Army could search its records
of intelligence badges issued and try to verify the fact.
Also, if Mr. Hurt can remember the units to which he was
assigned and the places where he served, Army files could
be checked to determine whether the units he mentions were
assigned to the places he mentions at the times he mentions.
Neither of these avenues of inquiry, however, would turn
up any new evidence on Mr. Hurt.
