NY 92-1108
ADMINISTRATIVE:

On 5/11/64, AL 3050-PC advised that during the prior
week at Aqueduct Race Track, the informant met JOIE KAUFMAN.
The informant stated that KAUFMAN advised him that he had a
fight with his wife and hit her during the incident. KAUFMAN
advised the informant that she threatened to go to the police
and since he was afraid the police might come to the house
on her complaint, he had to get a gun and "other stuff"
which would involve others, out of the house, so it would
not be found if the police appeared at his residence. KAUFMAN
told the informant that he put the gun and ‘other stuff" in a

‘friend's apartment. He stated that KAUFMAN did not identify the

"other stuff" or "the others who would be involved" or the
apartment in which the “stuff and gun" were relocated. Since
the aforementioned information does not specify that this
involved the subject, this information has not been inciuded
in the details of the report.

In the event additional information is developed to
further clarify this situation, appropriate steps will be taken
to forward any pertinent information to the NYCPD.

.-Byelosed is one copy each of the following communications
4 captioned, “Pacheco Petroleum Company:" Legat Havana letter to
Bureau 6/21/55 enclosing a blind memorandum also dated 6/21/55 and
Director's letter to ir. Dennis A. Flinn, Director, Office of
Security, Department of State, Washington, D. C., dated 7A4/55.

; -It is believed that the latter communication is identical i
with the letter referred to by AUSA Charles Stillman, Southern District |
of New York. ource T-1 referred to is HAV-11, formerly NYC-25~-
Criminal Informant, whe is Albert Nathaniel Schapir New York files ()
should contain considerable background on this individual. It is

noted that Schapiro voluntarily left the United States and took
residence in Cuba in 1947, following an Immigration and Naturalization
Service deportation hearing, which was cecasioned by the State
Department withdrawal of Schapire's passport based on 2a consideration
that he had been born in Poland, rather than in the United States as

he claimed.

During recent years, Schapiro has vesided in Paris, France,
and was last known to be under indictment for an undetermined crime
in Switzerland.

is believed that AUSA Stillman should be informed that |
the sourcexT-1 in the letter in question was a source abroad whopis.
Ry no longer in contact with this Bureau, and whose exact current A)
fy whereabouts are not known.
