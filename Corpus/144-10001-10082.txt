The personality and political background of) ‘President LYNDON
B. JOHNSON, as well as the circumstances which brought him to
power, seem to indicate that American foreign and domestic
policies, umder the new Administration, will probably, adhere to
the following basic directives: Z

1. In the short run, as a natural result of the momentum
of a strong Administration, such as’ that of President KENNEDY, no
profound changes are expected, especially in the field of foreign
policy (President JOHNSON has already stated that he.will follow
the foreign policy of Presidesit KENNEDY) ; :

2. In the longer run, however, one can foresee:

A) In the field of foreign policy, with the prec
dominance of the State Department over the White House "staff"((A))
(which reflected the strong perscnality of President KENNEDY and
his marked interest in international policy), there Probably
will be:

. I) No substantial change from the : KENNEDY line

. II). In the field of relations with Western
morepe. | or more precisely with France, a less rigid ‘attitude
and one of ‘greater acceptance of the French position, with the
objective of: maintaining a united Western front vis-a-vis the
possibility of. a political offensive by the Kremlin;:

III) « In relations with Latin Ameri¢a, the inter=
view which President JDHNSON will have this afternoon with the
Foreign Minister will certainly be more enlightening: than any
prediction made at this time;

B) In the field .of domestic policy, there will possibly
be an improvement in relations between the Executive ‘and the
Legislative within the line of "compromise"((A)); thé new Presi-
dent, much more the conservative than the innovator, with intimate
connections with the Congress, ‘and a Southerner, will: have more
facility in [gaining] approval of.the big bills ("civil rights,"
"fiscal reform," "medical aid," "aid to the aged," etc.) precisely
because he will accept more conservative formulas of compromise;
the new Administration will also tend’ to be more consérvative with
regard to government intervention in the, economy; however, radical
changes cannot be expected, since JOHNSON: will also face the
pressure of the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party, and
any more pronounced split within the Party would be fatal to the
hopes for victory in next year's election. :
