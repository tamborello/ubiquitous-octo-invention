time to time on a targets-of-opportunity basis, as has been
done in the past. In such cases the Station could use its
D& TO funds. This use should be limited, and the outlay
of funds should be minimized as much as possible.

of Identity A may continue to the end of FY 63. Beginning

1 July 1963 we would like the Station to phase out this
expense at whatever rate seems most suitable, but the phase-
out should be completed by 31 December 1963. Further contri-
butions cannot be authorized beyond that date. .

LIHUFF-1. He can be kept as a cutout to LIHUFF, but with the
curtailment of KUBARK's connection with LIKUFF, his services
will not be used enough to justify the salary that has been
proposed. The Station may either reduce his salary or use

c. Many of the activities contemplated in LIHUFF
are already fully covered by other operations of the
Station. LIHUFF would not contribute enough beyond the
overlap to be justified.

 

da. The Project would tend to put too much reliance
on conservative elements, around whom we have already
built a sizeable proportion of our program in Mexico.
Headquarters does not wish to expand further our involve—
ment with these elements.

e. We have noted, in both LIHUFF and LISIREN, the
reluctance of Mexican busineszmen to contribute to anti-
communist programs because they cannot deduct the contri-
butions from their income taxes. As a matter of principle,
we are moved to ask why ODYOKE funds should be spent in
any program--whose primary objective, after all, is to
preserve the capitalistic system under which these
Mexican industrialists hold and increase their affluence-~
if those who will benefit most materinlly and most
directly from it are unwilling to cortribute without
some recompense. Should the PBPRIME taxpayer assune
the burden of helping those who are unwilling to share
that burden? We feel he should not when he bears such
& heavy burden all around the world.

The latter, of course, is contingent on his suitability-~-
in terms of security considerations, his aptitude for certain
types of operations, his own preferences, time available, and

profitable use of LIHUFF-1 in other operations, it may ternin-
ate him at its discretion. If the Station plans to keep
LIHUFF-1, he should be placed under a project as soon as his
operational use is determined. If it is not feasible to put
him under the project that he will be working on, then a
separate project should be written to cover hin.

1. The LIHUFF Project has been stidied fully and
thoughtfully by Wi Division, including a review by Oliver
G. GALBOND. It has also been discussed with the KU#O0
Staff officers who review such projects for approval”
After thorough consideration, it 16 the consensua“in
