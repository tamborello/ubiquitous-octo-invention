Harlingen area since 1957 and he had no idea where ROGERS could be found, |
ROGERS worked for MEDDERS in 195, and part of 1955 dusting crops in the
Republic of Nicaragua. MEDDERS described ROGERS as being unstable, untrust-
worthy, nervous to the point of having seizures, that he was alcoholic and was
too rough on the Company's equipment. MEDDERS said that in Nicaragua pilots '
were allowed to carry side arms and that ROGERS went armed with a pistol. :
ROGERS was deported from Nicaragua for taking some shots with his pistol at {
personnel around a local airport. \

"MEDDERS stated that he had formerly known a duster pilot named B. OLSEN
who fit the general physical description of SHAND's source. MEDDERS said that
OLSEN was even more unstable than ROGERS and had worked in the Harlingen area
for several years. MEDDERS stated that OLSEN was in an advanced state of
alcoholism, that he lived around Wichita Falls, Texas, and that about six months
ago he heard that OLSEN was working in Oklahoma."
