ADMINISTRATIVE:

Two symbol numbers have been used to further conceal
the identity of NO 1283-C-TE, whose identity is known to the
Bureau. .

Inasmuch as the subject of this case is being
contacted under the TECIP, this case is being placed in a
pending inactive status.

Information relating to telephone toll records is
not being set forth in this report inasmuch as this investiga-
tion has failed to disclose any pertinent information.

The following is being set forth in the administrative
section due to the singular nature of the information:

NO 1283-C-TE furnished the following information
to.SA HAROLD V. HUGHES on 4/16/74: —

a
Source advised that NOFTO PECORA, JUR., son_cf7the
well-known New Orleans hoodlum, NOFIO PECORA, is-g0ing in
business with the Orleans Parish Coroner, Dr< FRANK MINYARD,
in the purchase of a 400-acre farm at McNeil, Mississippi.
This farm will be used for raising cattle and was formerly
owned by the late Senator Av’ D. SMITH, brother of FRANCES

PECORA. =

a

i

; This farm is being purchased for $125,000 and a
Government loan is being obtained so that the total cash
outlay on the part of young PECORA and Dr. MINYARD will only
be $10,000 or $20,000. ~ ‘

Source said this extremely favorable price was :
obtained from the bonding company which has taken over all of
the assets of the late Senator A. D. SMITH because of FRANCES
PECORA's relationship with SMITH and because of her position
of influence in the State of Louisiana, with the State Insurance
Board,

Source pointed out that the house alone on the property
is valued at somewhere around $75,000.00. Source said that
he believed that realistic evaluation of the property would be
somewhere in the neighborhood of $300,000.
