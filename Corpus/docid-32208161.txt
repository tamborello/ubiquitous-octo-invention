iLately, he has become a serious and general nuisance stemming

"from his impersonation of Assistant Director William C, Sullivan
of this Bureau by renting post.office boxes in his name, by
sending literature in his name to the Central Intelligence Agency

at Mr, Sullivan's office and became so belligerent it was necessary
for him to be escorted from the building. He has an obsession to
serve this. Bureau as an informant; however, we have advised him

crimes committed by him, including the above-referred-to .
impersonation violation of Mr, Sullivan and a violation involving
his.signing the late President John F, Kennedy's name as the

SSR and joffered his services as an espionage agent in the |
United States. [He has also been in contact with the Soviet Embassyl5]],
é] He is well known ;
to the U.S, Secret Service which has previously had him committed
in St. Elizabeths Hospital; however, he left this institution on
his own and there is no order for his return, On April 8, 1964,
he attempted to call President Lyndon B, Johnson from Dallas,

As an indication of the subject's potential dangerousness,
it is pointed out that in March, 1955, he mailed a post card to

his stepfather in Essex, Maryland, stating he was armed with a

38 caliber pistol and. would kill him if he caused him "personal
contact!' On May 10, 1963, he was arrested in Fairbanks, Alaska,
for carrying a concealed weapon, On May 13, 1963, he wrote to
Mr, Sullivan enclosing a receipt dated May 7, 1963, for the
purchase of one Smith and Wesson ,38 caliber revolver and one
British. Army rifle with a notation in his handwriting "Am in
possession of. the described firearms," ae ; :

The U; S, Embassy in Quito, Ecuador, found subject there
on May 5, 1964, completely destitute and reported him to be highly
mentally unstable, He was returned by ship to Tampa, Florida, on
May 28, 1964, by the Department of State which had requested that '
a doctor from the Veterans Administration be on-hand to meet him a
when the ship arrived, The subject was met but, declined to be i
hospitalized which apparently was his prerogative and, therefore, 7

‘he was not detained,

On July 13, 1964, the subject telephonically contacted
Special Agent L, Cottrell Schmidle at our Washington Field Office,
He advised Schmidle that he was calling from Buffalo, New York,
and he would be in Washington, D, C., in a few days, If he
contacts Special Agent Schmidle, he will be thoroughly interviewed
concerning his statement "I have information which may solve the
mystery of November 22, 1963," appearing on the post card.

_ Attached for your assistance is a copy of a report
dated April 2, 1964, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, concerning
the subject, In this connection, it is requested after a review !

in respect to the subject, ~
