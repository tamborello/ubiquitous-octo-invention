DATE: 03/28/96 01:19:41 PM
SUBJECT: HPSCI Request for staff brief on JFK assassination

HPSCI staffer Susan Ouellette liked John Pereira’s 27 Mar 96 telecon on the JFK assassination issue (see attached note) so much that
she'd like to schedule a staff brief for sometime in the next two weeks. She'd like the brief to concentrate on two issues mentioned by

John in the telecon:
~-Differences with the Board on release of certain info (names of former employees, identification of stations),
and ~Current appeal to the White House of decesion of Board to release certain info we redacted.

Defer to John and DO addees to work out who'll brief (see separate note from poormg st Bill McNair.)

Quellette suggests c. 1000 either Apr 2, 3, or 4, or Apr 9, 10, 11 since HPSCI recess schedule is pretty open.
John, pis advise your timing preference. Thanks.

Memo for Record RELEASE IN FULL

Subject: - Status of JFK Records Review 2000

References: Letter from Marwell to Pereira, dtd 15 Dec 96,
(same subject) ;
Letter from Pereira to Marwell, dtd 19 Jan 96,
(response to above letter);
Phone Conversation with Marwell, 22 Jan 96,
(same subject). :

1. Marwell requested a figure for the number of
records in the sequestered files that contained
postponements. I explained that our review figures were
based on pages and that there was no record count for the ‘
microfilm part of the collection. However, based on the HRG
index unaudited record count (see below) of the Oswald 201
file and the JFK hardcopy boxes, I was able to give him an
estimate of 28,000 records.

2. Unaudited HRG Index statistics:

Total Records Records w/Postponements
Oswald. 4,349 See orate gery
JFK :
(63 boxes) 28,532 oo 12,132

32,881 (154,724 pages). 14,003

The page count for the hardcopy part of the collection is
within 10,000 pages of the Microfilm (163,500). Given that
the microfilm contains many duplicates and similar records
as the hardcopy, the percentage of sanitized documents
should be close to the same. I estimate the total number of
records with postponements to be approximately 28,000.

NOTE FOR: All HRG Members
SUBJECT: Briefing of HPSCI on Denied JFK Documents

’

This is to let everyone know that HRG has been asked to
brief the HPSCI staff on the 10,000 pages of JFK materials
that we have denied in full (so far).

The request came from HPSCI Chairman Dan Glickman, who
apparently anticipates questions from others in Congress
about the denied documents.

Among the questions we are asked to address in the
briefing are the following:

- How many documents are involved (as opposed to
pages)?

~ What specific types of sources and methods are
we protecting?

- What is the review process?
- Who made the judgments to deny the documents?

~ Are there provisions for continuing review of the
denied documents?

We've asked that the briefing not take place until the
week of 30 August, but HPSCI may want it sooner.

this. .
