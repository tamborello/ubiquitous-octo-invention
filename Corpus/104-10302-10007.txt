On “about 16 we November a.
. Soviet E-class nuclear~powered
{/ Submarine, equipped with cruise
;/ missiles, completed a 41-day

{; patrol in the northern Pacific.
ij This voyage, the first known

; out-of-area mission by any of
the USSR's nuclear missile sub-
marines, may presage their regu-
‘lar use on patrols in the Atlan-
tic and Pacific Oceans.

  
 
 

The first Soviet nuclear
| submarine was probably completed
i in 1958, and some 30 nuclear~
fh powered units have since been
j placed in service. Until re-
yi. cently, these seldon left home
| waters, perhaps with good
(| reason. There are numerous
' reports of troubles with venti-
| lation and propulsion systems.

 

 

Since June of this year,
however, there have been several
long-range nuclear submarine op-
if erations, culminating in the

Pacific cruise. This. suggests
i that technical problems have
generally been ironed out and
|; that the submarines, or at least
i. some of them, now have ‘become
i. fully operational.

i:
\ These operations included
a five-week voyage by an E-class

submarine “from ‘Wiadivostok to
Petropavlovsk in July and August,
which apparently simulated an out-|
of-area cruise although the sub- |
marine probably never left So- \
viet waters. From late July to Li
early September an unusual de-
ployment of auxiliaries, includ- ||
ing submarine support ships, to i”
an area near the Canary. Islands
may have been in support of a it
nuclear submarine mission into
the Atlantic. There is also some
tenuous evidence that, during the ||
same period, Northern Fleet H-
class and N-class nuclear subma- |
rines may have participated in
an interfleet exercise in the
Norwegian Sea and northeast At-
lantic.

  
           
       
         
     

In early September an N- |
class torpedo-attack submarine My
of the Northern Fleet left the j
Kola Inlet, transited polar seas, i

and arrived at Petropavlovsk

some 15 days later. Another N-
class submarine apparently carried|\)
out a polar operation in late \"
September and early October which ||:
may have included the circumnavi- ||
gation of the Spitsbergen Islands. \

The only extended operations /
by Soviet nuclear submarines
noted earlier were four probable |
under-ice cruises near Spits- |
bergen and some N-class submarine
participation in the 1962 summer }
interfleet exercise in the At- i
lantic and Norwegian Sea. (TOP |.

Cuba

CUBANS APPREHENSIVE OVER POSSIBLE US POLICY CHANGE

Cuban leaders are appre-
hensive that President Kennedy's
assassination will result in a
wore “aggressive US policy to-
ward Cuba. Intercepted Cuban
military messages revealed that
certain units of the armed
forces were put. on defensive
alert immediately after news of
the President's death reached
Cuba. The alert was maintained
for about three days.

Fidel_Castro's two-hour
speech on 23 November, which he
termed an “objective analysis"
of the implications of the
assassination, warned Cubans
that the President's death was
"serious and bad news." It
could, he said, turn "a bad
situation" into a worse one.

He also asserted that President
Kennedy's alleged promise not
to invade Cuba had been strongly
attacked by those “ultrareac-:
tionaries" in the United States
who now are trying to create a
climate of “anti-Soviet and
anti-Cuban hysteria" designed
to pressure the new US Presi-
dent toward a Cuban policy
"highly prejudicial to the in-
terests of peace and of man-
kind."

Castro stated that he had
never heard of Lee Harvey Oswald
and insinuated that the Castro-

29 Nov 63

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY REVIEW

Communist affiliations of the
accused assassin were fabricated
by US “reactionaries" who, he
claimed, were the only people

who could benefit from the Presi-
dent's death. In this connec-
tion he warned that a "sinister
maneuver" was under way, and
declared "we must be cautious

and vigilant and alert."

Che Guevara echoed these
warnings in a speech of 24
November, declaring that "the
years coming are going to be
as tough as, if not tougher
than, the years just past...we
must be prepared to repel any
attack." He expressed confi-
dence in ultimate victory, not
only for Cuba but also for
"the peoples of Latin America."

Guevara stressed that the

‘revolutionary ferment in Latin

America is reaching a climax
and that the people there "are

going to conquer power in what-
. ever manner necessary, destroy-

ing whatever force that opposes
them."" He pointed out that
Cuba's continuing "anti-imperi-
alist struggle" is closely
linked with the coming revolu-
tion in the rest of Latin Amer-
ica. "The fight of all peoples
is also our responsibility,"

he maintained, “and it is part
of our daily preoccupation."
