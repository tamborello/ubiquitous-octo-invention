12 It must be stressed that the voice intercept and photographic
coverage was not (and normally is not) processed in “real time." The
means of acquisition and the volume of the information precludes anything
but the spot reporting of items judged by the monitor to be of more than
ordinary interest and, therefore, noted in summary logs. Full texts of
selected items require consultation of the tape and either a full tran-
scription or full translation or both. Photo coverage tends to become
available in quantity lots which requires scanning and selection on a
rapid and accelerated basis in four or five day “peaks.” One of the
"triggers" that normally operates to focus and accelerate more speedy
review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is the mention of
aname. This was precisely what occurred in the second of two conversa-
tions on 1 October with the Soviet Embassy, during which the speaker said
he was "Lee OSWALD." It was this information reported by the Station to
Headquarters in its first indication on OSWALD on 8 October 1963.

13. The Mexico Station did one more thing in its 8 October report
on Lee OSWALD based on its 1] October voice intercepts: it coupled the
data with descriptive information it had acquired from a sensitive
collateral source--a photograph of a male individual, apparently an
American, who was observed entering the Soviet Embassy on 1 October.
The Station reported this detail on the 8th as a matter of coincident

fact. The Station did not assert or suggest that the data deduced from

the photo was in fact OSWALD, or indeed, was in any way related to OSWALD.

Lee Harvey OSWALD - CIA Coverage of His Mexico City Stay

14. One additional element of background must be stipulated now as
the final precondition to understanding the relevance (or irrelevance)
of the photo of the unknown individual placed in the chain of evidence
on 23 November in Dallas by FBI Agent Bardwell ODUM: what was the
totality of CIA Mexico's coverage of OSWALD's activity as of the after-

noon of the 23rd when all available coverage had been checked?

15. The totality of Mexico Station coverage on, or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD, consisted of five (5) voice intercepts as follows:

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday), 1605 hours Mexico City time.
Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national, a local employee of the Cuban
Embassy, Consular section, a receptionist, speaks with an unknown
male at the Soviet Embassy. Silvia DURAN tells the man that the
American citizen was there, the one who wants a visa for Cuba on
his way to the Soviet Union, and he wants to know with whom he was
talking there because she (Silvia DURAN) had sent him to the Soviet
Embassy saying that if they accepted him and gave him a visa, then
the Cubans (Embassy) would also give him a visa without further
paper work, only advising Immigration in Cuba. The American, she
says, wants to know with whom he had talked there because he says
he was told there would be no problem. The man in the Soviet

Embassy says to wait a moment. A different Soviet speaks, and

10. At no time during his stay in Mexico City did the CIA acquire
a photo of OSWALD. A careful review of all coverage, voice intercept,
as well as photographic, of both the Soviet and Cuban Embassies was
conducted by the Station on 22 and 23 November 1963 after the assassina-
tion, going back to materials from August 1963. It is, therefore, firm
that there was no CIA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his
Mexico trip or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a
cabled request on 15 October, the Mexico Station had no photo of OSWALD
in its records, nor did it receive one from Headquarters--which did not

have one either--before 22 November 1963.

1. byvita Enis intensive review of voice intercept transcripts
by the monitor and other personne] on the basis of the 1 October inter-
cept--which had been reported to Headquarters and disseminated to the ,
interested members of the intelligence community (as an ex-Marine OSWALD
was a Navy and FBI case under the Delimitations Agreement, and potentialTy
of interest to the Department of State)--turned up matches based on
content with materials intercepted on 27 and 28 September 1963. These
matches were reported to Headquarters on 23 November 1963. Analysis
based on voice comparison (except for what could be recalled by the
monitor--and this was not an insignificant element because of the
memorably poor Russian spoke by OSWALD) could not be made because the

tapes, in accordance with the normal practice, had been erased and re-used.

1963 to about 8:30 a.m. 2 October 1963. His place of residence was a
smal] commercial traveler hotel, not frequented by "gringos"~-the

Hotel Commercio--where he was registered under alias. Exhaustive and
detailed interviews and interrogation by the Mexican authorities and

the FBI, after the assassination, established that in the recollection of

all hotel personnel he left early and returned late each day of his stay.

8. Assuming, and allowing for the fact of late arrival and early
departure, that he slept one-third of the time of his stay (38 or 39
hours), there remain some 78 hours of activity to be accounted for.
Qverall, CIA's information can account solely for very brief periods
during 27, 28 September and 1 October. Al] coverage by CIA during the

entire period was technical. The Station had no live source (living

 

agent) coverage

 

 

 

9. It should be noted that OSWALD was in no sense “under investi-
gation." None of the facts of his defection and stay in the USSR and
return to the U.S., 1959 - 1962, were known to Mexico Station files
before 10 October 1963, when the bare bones of his biography were
forwarded by Headquarters in response to a Station cabled report of
8 October which had forwarded, on a routine basis, what appeared to be
a contact by an American for a visa to Cuba in transit to the USSR. This
was indicated and deduced from technically acquired information on
] Octobér, which was the first and only occasion in which OSWALD

identified himself (partially) by true name.

sensitive intelligence operation being conducted in October 1963 by the

Embassies in Mexico City.

3. Under the extraordinary press of effort to develop information
on the assassin and the assassination, copies of the photograph were
made available by CIA's Mexico Station Chief on the afternoon of

22 November to the local FBI representative, and later that day,

‘assertedly on the decision of the Ambassador, copies were conveyed by

an FBI representative by a special flight carried out by the U.S. Naval
Attache to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use in the ongoing
investigation. One photograph, cropped by the FBI, was shown to

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD (Lee Harvey OSWALD's mother) in Dallas on the
evening of 23 November 1963 by FBI Agent Bardwell D. ODUM.

4. The Warren Commission's report describes the sequence of events
at pp. 364-365 and 667 (Attachment B) which ultimately resulted in .
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a cropped
photo of Jack RUBY the day before he murdered her son. (A further
complication compounding this erroneous conclusion was the fact that
when she had been shown a copy of the same photograph in her appearance
before the Commission, it had been cropped by the FBI in Washington in

a slightly different manner.) -

politicized, rigidly deterministic interpretive climate that has been
nurtured by the media over the past decade about the Kennedy Assassina-
tion. The photograph, acknowledged now not to be RUBY, has continued to

preoccupy "specialists" and has become the centerpiece of another

hypothesis that holds OSWALD to have been "framed" by the use of a

double in his activity in Mexico city.2

Lee Harvey OSWALD - Reporting on Mexico City Stay

6. Although in no way related to Lee Harvey OSWALD or his stay in
Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 to the morning of
2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the unidentified man
originated during OSWALD's stay there. It is important, therefore, to
an understanding of the acquisition and handling of the photographs by
the Mexico Station to review what the Station ascertained and did with
the information it developed about OSWALD in Mexico City, together with

Headquarters action on that information.

7. From all credible evidence known to this time (none, incidentally,
added since the exhaustively unique work of the Warren Commission),
Lee Harvey OSWALD spent four (4) full days and two (2) partial days--

about 116 hours in all--in Mexico City from about 10:00 a.m. 27 September

4. The point of the referenced memorandum is that
consideration should be given now to "whether or not the : “|
entire matter can be fully disclosed at this time." This gle}e
submission is designed to make it possible for you, the :
IG and others whom you may desire to consult to make this
decision. The narrative-interpretive summary has been
put together in such a way that it discloses no cyptonyms, !
pseudonyms or other CIA jargon. However, its contents qo -
well beyond what has been released to the public thus far .
in the Warren Commission documentation. This point must :
be borne in mind in making a decision on Mr. Belin's i
question. To remove any question in anybody's mind about
our good faith in this matter, the narrative is backed up
by copies of actual documentation from our files. It
seems to me necessary, in reply to Mr. Belin, that he or
his representative review the documentation that backs up
the narrative. The documentation has not been keyed into
the narrative presentation, but it follows the chronologi-
eal order of presentation from 9 October into the latest
developments in the matter, and there is an overall index
to facilitate reference to individual items. [NB: There

is only one copy of this collection; this is it.J7

5. As noted above, one of the photographs taken in
Mexico City on 4 October 1963 was introduced into the
Warren Commission public record. However, it was intro-
duced into that record in two cropped versions. The
Warren Commission and its staff were made fully aware in
the course of their inquiry at Headquarters and in
Mexico City of the origins of the photograph, the fact
that we had additional photographs of the same individual 2 :
taken at different times in Mexico City and on the basis i
of full knowledge of these facts reached their own con-
clusions regarding the irrelevance of the photograph to
OSWALD and the assassination.

tion of analytical error, misjudgement and under the
stress of an urgent desire to contribute to the develop-
ment of the investigation of the assassination, a
cropped version of one of the photographs of the
Unidentified Individual was introduced into the chain of
evidence in the OSWALD case on 23 November 1963 by an
FBI representative in Dallas. The successive vicissi-
tudes which have now made this event a cause celebre
right down to the present moment are detailed in the

had indicated in writing to Chief, CIOPS, that he has no
objection. for Mr. Belin to do whatever is desired with
these photographs at this time. It should be noted that
Mr. Fensterwald in 1971 - 1972 was actually shown, by
Mr. Houston during a visit to the Agency, two of the
twelve photographs, other than the one already published
in the Warren Commission report. (It is these two that
he has published in The New York Review of Books article
which Mr. Belin attaches to his memorandum.)

7. It seems to me that whoever makes a decision on
whether the entire matter can be fully disclosed at this

_ time should bear in mind that a subsidiary decision must

also be made, i.e., whether to crop or otherwise fuzz up
the background of the photographs or, alternatively, to
publish the entire run of the photographs for the first
time without taking out the background. Obviously, none
of these questions apply to the passage of this material
to Mr. Belin and the Rockefeller Commission itself. I
think they should see the entire documentation as it
stands. Perhaps after that, the question of what could
be discussed and the question of "how?" and "how much?"
could be taken up with Mr. Belin himself. My personal
recommendation is that the more we can say about this
matter in a fully open and final manner, the better off
we will be as an Agency. But it is my understanding
that there are still sensitivé aspects deriving from the
fact_that the operation which produced the photographs
was and as a consequence

 

 

 

 

. publication at this time would create additional problems

at that level in Mexico. Also, it should be noted that
the Ambassador, according to Win Scott's memorandum to
J.C. King on 22 November 1963 (see Item 8 in the backup
documentation), allegedly played a direct role in the
decision to put the photographs into the hands of the FBI
in Dallas laterally from the Field. As far as I know,
there has not been anything published about this aspect

"at any time in the past nor have we had any discussions

with the State Department about that aspect of the matter.
