Subject: - Analysis of LIFEAT Traffic Relating to LIEING/3 for | y)
. - the Period 19-26 Apis 1957. .

 

L “In reviewing the traffic for the period indicated Bowton ford :
valuable confirmation of LIRING/3 and LIRING/4 contact with Ranire » é

Abreu, indicating that both persons complied with.Rowton's suggezsions. ‘

LIRIKG/3's ‘telephonic contacts. with Enrique Morales in Guatemate City .
confirmed reports given to him (Rowton) before and after the evezt. :

The only item not reported to Rowton by LIRING/3 is a dinner engzze~

ment which Enrique Morales had in Guetemala City on 25/4/67 with ‘friends" ;

of Morales' wife, Esperanza. SAN~10 (17.5) also reveals that LERZHG/3

and Morales are engaged in some sort of deal for the purchase of : ‘parses :

or briefcases (bolsas). ‘either in Guatenala or San Cristébal for z resale

in Mexico ‘Caty or import into the U.S. at a higher price. (LIETNS/3

mentioned the opportunities in this line~to Rowton previously, cu Row-

ton did not react favorably). | |

2. The following are Rowton's comments ‘on specific portions of tke take
which will serve to clarify them in relationship to reports made to him
by LIRING/3 and LIRING/4: ©

LIRING/4: Contacts with Ramiro Abreu: ‘on 20/67, shortly after Zowton

suggested that LIRING/4 recontact Abreu and attempt to effect shrovgh
hima reconciliation with the local mission, LERING/4 telephconed the
Embassy- and attampted to reach Abreu. From the content and tone of her
questions and remarks, it appears obvious thet LIRING/4 has net had re-
cent contact with the Cuban mission. She asxs.when Abreu is leaving for.
Havana, but is given no information. She tries again at abort 1900 and
2000, but there is no answer. She finally gets througo to Abrez on
14-13-26 who promises to come to her home jbetween 1C00 and 4400 the
following day (23/4/67)... She has to give. ‘Abreu the address, indicaiing
that bhé is not fauiliar with the hone add: ess of LIRING/3 orfz.

SAN-10 (5.0, 8.2, 12. 2) reveal that Abreu ealled or talked to 222 hiG/4
>on the telephone - “three times on: 14/4/67. LIRNG/A makes reference to

cussed between her and Abreu at their 23/4/67 ‘Gonversation. vhher re-

marks made both by LIRING/4 and Abreu indicate that Abreu is, or watne

in aubstance by LIRING/3, although Rowton has not as yet had a chance
to talk directly with LIRING/& to get her version of the conversations
with Abreu. Apparently in ordes to put Abreu off (in his ‘amonmous, de-
signs) LIRING/4 tehls him on 25/4/67 that her husband auapects: that
something is going on between them. In reply to Abreu'’s anxious ques-
tioning, LIRING/4 states that her husvend asked her whethor ashe liked
Abreu and whether Abreu like her, to which she said that whe replied in
the affirmative (this apparently was calculated to cool Abreu off
without alisnating him). Abreu's visit to the ppartment’ and his pro-
poed luncheon date with LIRING/3 were confimmed by the latter in his
report to Rowton on 27/4/67.

Conversativns Re the Birth Certificate: In SAN-10 (2.5) LIRIKG/3 asks
hie(Guatemalan friend (Jacobo icdriguez Padilla?) whether it matters if
the birth certifiente te for a nerson 10 years older? Jdaabo revlied
in the negative, but ‘would prefer it of a person ten years younger.LI~.

 

: RING/3 promises to have the birth certificate in his possession by

25-26/4/6' 9, This is the first confirmation Rowton has had of a state-
ment made to him some two weeks previously that when he wont to pick up

the (false) birth certificate at Registro Civil on instructions of his

half-brother (and the lawyer Rolendo Riojas). he discoversd that it was
tor a person born in 1946 and hence useless for himself. LIkING/3 also.
reported to Rowton that:Jacobp kad contacted him recently and asked for
help in obtaining false papers for himself. The above conversation .

‘therefore would indicate that LIRING/3 plans to give Jacobo the false

document originally procured for himself through his half-brother. Li-
RING/3, however, has not revealed this plan to Rowton. :
SAN-11 (16.0) reveals that LIAING/3 inforied his brother two days late
that he has spent over. ten days at Registro Civil but it is ninpossible
to get the birth certificate. the book no longer eximsts." He adds thet —

he has written his half-brother a letter explaining everything. LIRING/3

reported to Rowton that he had asked his half~brother to obtain an
“acta notorial” in lieu of. ‘oritah certificate and hoped to have the doca-
ment soon. ‘
