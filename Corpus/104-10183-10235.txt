b. A/1 was requested to meet Carlos Jorge
ROBRENO Marquez aka “El Mago" who has communicated
with A/1 by letter and phone from Paris 02 several.
occasions, having brought 2 “personal™ message from —
AMLASH/1 for A/1. A/1 is also to get a good assessment
of "EL Mago", including a determination his reasons
for Teaving Cuba, or considering so, permanantly. it
is possible that "£1 Mago” may be a good prospect for
récrustiient;: although as an individual, he is not
particularly palatable. This opinion is also that
of both AMLASH and A/1; but as an action type, he may
be suitable for specific tasks. (See report of
28-29 February 1964 Meeting) A/1 was told to bear
in mind that a person of this type could have been
co-opted hy the DSE in return for dropping of possible
criminal charges for public brawls, etc. As discussed
in the previous contact report, "EL Mago" drinks
heavily to the extent that he upon more than one
occasion has gotten into serious brawls, including
the one several years ago in which he shot an American
citizen for alleged advances to a girl friend of his.
("EL Mago's" motives and truce allegiance remain clouded,

to say the least.)

c. According to letters from "El Mago," Jose
Alberto IBARRA Martin, aka “gE, Loco Blanco", is
expected to follow "El Mago" to Paris; and he too
has additional information from AMLASH., At this
writing, "El Loco" has not arrived in Paris. ("E1_Loco”
is of the Same ilk, same crowd, as "EL Mago,” but a0
very bright.) 4/1 was also asked to debrief him,
assess, and report if he showed up while A/1 was in town.

: o
O& d. According 0% letter from (RASANCOS)(Paris
Embassy vice consul 9), Ambassador CARRILLO q/1i9}} ol
was most anxious td see and dine with A/i. Thén, just .
prior to A/i's departure for Paris, he received a
call from Havana from an old friend and former jeweler,

_ Jose IGLESIAS (also a lawyer and university professor )

who said that the Cuban government wished A/1 to go to
Peague to appraise and arrange for the sate of a large
quantity of jewelry taken from the Batistianos at the
end of the revolution. The government was asking
300,900 dollars for the jewelry. A/1 said he refused to
go to Prague as it would possibly jeopardize his
standing with the U.S. Imnigration Service. IGLHSIAS
said he uaderstood and would relay A/l's answer.
