match the correct one to the photograph
without further particulars)

matches the photograph. Therefore we
cannot iGentify subject-accurately)

the Cubans and identified as Orlando
BCSCH AYILA are not one and the same
persons. We also cannot establish
whether cr not Orlando BOSCH and Orlando
BCSCH MELUSA are one and the same person)
