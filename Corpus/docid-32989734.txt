. There has been no information developed to show
that violence is intended or expected by persons active in .
the racial and civil rights matters.

There is only one person on the agitator index
who might be the subject of future counterintellizence by
this office. This individual is JOHN EOVIN JACKSON, Route . .
1, Box 191, Hayneville, Alabama. He is a Negro male, born
2/17/48, and is employed as a farmer. Much of the militant
Givil rixhts activity in Lownies County, Ala., is believed
. traceable to J: ACKSON, and he is a contact of STOKSLY
CARMICHASL when CARKICHASL comes to Lowndes G@unty.

Investigation is being conducted at the present
time to determine if SNCC reopens an office at Selma, Ala.,
which was maintained by SNGC. in the past. If this office
is reopened to direct shCC activities, then that office would —
be a logical tarkét for counterintelligence activities.

Concerning suggestions for the over all counter~
intelligence action, it is felt that the Bureau misht consider
the creation of a paper Negro nationalist zroup for the
purpose of drawing together militant leaders and militant
Broups in order to plant seeds of dissension among such leaders. ‘It

, also should be considered that counterintelligence action
‘ ° could be aimed apainst radical racial leaders in any organization
, by the use of reliable press contacts being given information
‘ which would sorve to diseredit these leaders. Such infor-
mation, indicating that leaders are using the civil rizaots
movement for thelr own gain and are not instituting programs
aimed at encouraging a Negro to help himself, could be used
throush reliable press contacts or responsible national
Negro leaders. This type of action might serve to bring about
a feeling of distract anong radical Nerro Leaders.

Specific suggestions, as may be developed for
_ possible use in the counterintelligence field, will be sent to
‘the Bureau by separate Letter. Quarterly letters will be
submitted as suggested. -

“As the Bureau has been separately advised, in-
vestigation has not been developed that any militant Black.
Nationalist group has been in existence in the Mobile
territory. There has been no activity of The Revolutionary
Action Movement (RAM), Congress of Racial Equality (CORES),
or Nation of Islam (NOI). The Southern Christian Leadership
. Conference (SCLC) has representatives in this division, but

no organizational headquarters or office. The Student

Nonviolent Coordinat tinz Committee (SNCC) has representatives
coming to the Mobile Division periodical ly, particularly

coning to Selma, Tuskegses or Hontgonery, dees but investi-~ :
gation has not shown that SUCC has any office in this territory.

The Lowmdes County Freedom Organization {LcFo), ,

- which is also known as the Lowndes County Freedom Party and
the Black Panther Party Ys is a Hegro civil rights organization
established in Alabama Novenber, "196 $5. It is a political
party, designed to: run candidates for public office. It. has
received publicity as the Black Panther Party, bub is not
affiliated with the Black Panther Party established in New
York City during 1956. In the organization of LCFO,-assistance

By pandling as above, we would eliminate the
possibility of these rumors being attributed to the FSI.

Consideration has been given to some method of
discouracinz A ALBERT TURNER, who is “Field Secretary for KING s
project, and is spsareheadinz the recruitment throughout our
territory and other portions of Alabama. From our contact
with TURNER, who is a linison source, it is the opinion of
contactin; agents that he is so sold on the project that it
is almost impossible to disiliusion hin.

It is also felt that some method of setting an
article in the ‘Southern Courier” along the lines of the aboye -
would have a discouraging effect on the Neero community in
and around Montzomery, Ala., since the Courter is very widely
' read, Consideration is being given to the method of scconme-
pLishing this. os :

The Bureau is requested to, consider the proposal
set forth above and aay vise. :

° I have considered this matter, discussed it with”
appropriate a;ent and s uperva sory personnel of the Mebile
Office and the Pollo: wine is proposed ag a counterinteliigence
move on KENG!S Yashinston Spring Project. Dye

_ KING has quite a folle: wing in and around the Selma,
Ala, area and has apreared recently in Selma on one oacragsion
at the church of Reverand L. i. SANDERSON, who, at the time of
KING's apyearance, vas cunning for mayor of Selma. ANDERSON,
Was tentatively endorsed by KING and was subsequently defeated
in his race for mayor of Selma,

Reverend FREDERICK DOUGLAS RESSE, who is head of
the Dallas County Voters Leasue and is quite influential among
the Necro community in the Selma area, did not endorse ENDERSON
for mayor and informed sources indicate he more or less corn
tributed to the defeat of ANDERSON. REESE has been knoim to
make derozatory remarks concerning KING and was allecvedly
miffed that KING did not advise him, REESE, of Mis, KING s,
gontemplated visit te Selma. .

In ylew of the above, ‘4t is felt that af ‘sone
method can be devised whereby REHSE can be advised of certain
items rélative to the Washington Spring Project, he would take
action to Giscouwrage individuala from participating therein,

Ib is mot believed that REESE could be contacted
by & Bureau Agent, although he his on occasion furnished us
Anformation which has proven to be reliabie. .

it is, therefore, proposed that an anonymous letter
be directed to REESE at his home address, 1566 Ranme, Selma,
Alabama 35701, wherein it is called to the attention of REESE
that KING is merely using the Negroes of the Selma area for
his own personal acgrandizement: that he is not genuinely
interested in their welfare, but only in their donations; that
in all probability the individuals going to Washington for
the Spring Project will be left stranded without suitable
housing or food. The letter should also play up the possibili-

_ty of violence, particularly the fact that althoush CARMICHAEL

and BROUN of SNCC have a so-called sentlemens' agreement with
KING not ta take over this action, there exists a strong
possibility that such will occur, There is also the possibili-
ty of RAM and NOI taking over the project since it lacks
organization and direction, The letter should also peint out
that KING was in Alabama on about 3/21/68, and did not make

‘his schedule in the Selma and adjoining counties area, which

was another indication that KING was talking out of both side
of his mouth. . ,

It is felt that this letter should be mailed from
either Washington or Baltimore since, if the letter is mailed
from anywhere in the south, REESE may feel it is the work of
the Klan or some other racist group. It is felt that Raltimore
would prohably be the best since a letter from Washington would
indicate the possibility of the government doing this,

Simultaneous with mailing the letter from Raltimore,
it is proposed that a copy of the letter to REESE, tosether
with a cover letter, be mailed to ROSWELL FALKENPERRY, Editor
and Publisher, Selma Times-Journal, Selma, Alabama. The cover
letter should indicate that attached was a letter directed to
REESE and that he, FALKENBERRY, might want to contact REESE
relative to REESE's receipt of the letter and what it said.

The thought behind this is to give FALKENBERRY 2a
chance to interview REESE concernins receipt of the letter -
and thereby create a news story which could legitimately be
published and read by the Newro comunity inthe Selma area,
it is known that the Selma Times-Journal has a large circula«~
tion amon; the Negro community in Dallas and adjoining counties
and has taken a rather liberal attitude in connection with
elvil rights movements.
