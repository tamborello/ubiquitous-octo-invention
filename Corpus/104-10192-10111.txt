’ they accomplished this, the naval vessol left,

the boat, went alongside her, but. tho authorities did not board
her, Since the deck of the vessel was ‘considerably higher than

that of the MDC Loat, .it was easy for the authorities to observe

aboard her a S7-mm fecoilless cannon, _& 20-ag Finnish-mide
cannon, an AR-15 rifle, and. two wermait machine guns, In order
to avoid arrest and having thelr poat confiscated, the crew of
the VICKY I decided to throw all thoir weapons overboard. Once

The, Santa Cruz -digtillery. was selected as a target because it te i
the second most important distillery in Cuba and because the MDC

‘pad received information that a special gasoline to be used for

military purposes was being distilled there.

As a result of the designation of Hernandez Rojo as ¢hief of the
woc's military sector,?, three raid operations were prepared
between late June and late July. In addition to Operation Cacahual,
the. MDC: has prepared Operation Maceo, which involves a naval

attack against the radar installations at Cabo de San Antonio on

the Peninsula of Guanahacabibes, Pinar del Rio Province, and

’ Operation Machete, which is. to be directed against the destruction
- of the refrigeration. equipment at the fishing cooperative in :

Dimas, Pinar del Rio Province,4 These two operations are ex-

‘pected to be launched as soon as circumstances permit.

The MDC has always had the policy of. conduc ting military opera- ;
tions against Cuba, but it had not been able to do anything because

of the lack of strength of Laureano Batista Falla,. former military
leader of the MDC, Butista Falla had Knowkedge of Operation

Cacahual, but he did not participate in it.

The military budget of the MDC is $750. per month, which amount
is received from Batista Falla‘s private funds, However, the MDC
expects to receive financial agsistance from its delegations in
Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Mexico, Now York and West Germany.

Field Comments:

1. The W-42 has been“identified as a United States Coast Guard
vessel out of New Orleans, Louisiana, The Coast Guard has
denied the involvement of the W-42 in this incident. -

2. Another source, who has been trained in informtion collection
and whose previous reporting has been accurate but lacking
in depth, has reported that, according to Angel M, Hernandez
Rojo, the crew of the VICKY I first became aware that they
were being pursued when they were about 23 miles from Key
West on the night of 26 July. : : .

3. CSDB-312/01498-65, dated 24 June 1965, reported that Hernandz
Rojo had been appointed chief of the military sector and was
to assume his responsibilities immediately. °
