CHICOFSKY stated that he believes that JOHN KELLEY
was involved in the robbery of the VA Hospital and he said
this because CHICOFSKY claims that on several occasions in
the past KELLEY, who CHICOFSKY says believes the Post Office
has some kind of an apparatus on his 1966 gold Cadillac
which enables them to ascertain the whereabouts of this
ear, has intentiionally left his car in. downtown Boston,
proceeded with.the informant via the car borrowed from
"PRO"LERNER or from some other person, to Hyde Square ‘where
they would.walk over to a 1962 or 1963 Buick, two-door,
hardtop, light blue, and cream in color. CHICOFSKY said
that the car was a light blue top and light blue bottom, and
had a cream stripe; that the driver of this car was 40 years
oftage; 5'7" to 5'8"; stocky build;,approximately 160 lbs.3;
very dark complected and appeared to be an Italian and
had a flat nose and black ‘hair.

CHICOFSKY said that this individual would get
in to the back seat of the car and KELLEY would sit in the
passenger seat and he would drive on KELLEY's instructions
into the vicinity of the VA Hospital, and that this
individual would get out and walk towards the VA Hospital.
CHICOFSKY stated that on other occasions he would drop them
off one street car stop away from the VA Hospital, and they
would take the street car to the VA Hospital, and he would
be back in an hour and a half to pick them up. CHICOFSKY
advised that this was taking place during the late morning
hours and that from conversation he knew that KELLEY was
looking over a score from the lobby of the VA Hospital.

Informant said he never heard this unknown person's
first name, but he got the impression that KELLEY was doing
this individual a favor by cutting him in on a score since
he. missed out on the Post Office score.

Informant further advised that KELLEY, in the last
two months , has not been associating openly with "PRO"LERNER
as he has.in the past, but that he definitely was still in

contact with LERNER but only on "clandestine meets."
