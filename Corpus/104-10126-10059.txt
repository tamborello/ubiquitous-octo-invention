vt CRET,

These files contain materials cited in the SUMMARY, includ-
ing sample photographs of the Consulate gate using the
K-100 and Robot Starr systems triggered by the VLS-2.

These systems are readily identifiable by nature of the
resultant prints. The K-100 is 16 mm. format and is so
marked on the reverse side of the print (although misidenti-
fied as Attachment A to HMMA-22433 when it should have been
Attachment B). The Robot Star is 35 mm. format. None of
these prints, which were sent to Headquarters as test
results on.7 November 1963, has the distinctive mark of

the Pulse Camera in the lower left corner. The Pulse
Camera recorded a time-date image in the lower left corner
from an internal Accutron movement. This can be seen in a
sample picture sent to Headquarters on 22 June 1965 (HMMA-
26414), entitled Details of LIONION Pulse: Camera Operation.
This report confirms, too, that the Pulse Camera did not
begin operation until "mid-December 1963." -

 

' ‘INFERENCES

The Warren Commission record concludes, from Duran
testimony, that Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate some-
time after arriving in Mexico City on the morning of
27 September 1963. That same morning, across the street
at LIERODE basehouse, the new trigger device and K-100/
Robot Star systems were in process of being installed. If
the installations were to have gone smoothly, the systems
may have been tested against the target at the very
moment when Oswald is supposed to have appeared. However,
the record of that morningS® efforts shows that the K-100
had a malfunctioning part which had to be remachined, It
is possible that this installation, begun in the morning,
may have \take II. into the afternoon to complete because
installation in a new room of the base-
house and (2) the technicians experienced problems with
the equipment. The ultimate setup would have been tested
on the target when it was complete. But the Consulate
officially closed at 1400 hours, after which there would
have been few, if any, targets (at the gate) for test
purposes. It may have been likely, then, that the instal-
lation, when completed, was not tested against actual (and
available) targets until the opening of business Monday
morning, 30 September. Oswald is not known to have visited
the Consulate after Saturday, 28 September. The LIOQNION
photographic site did not operate on Saturdays.

 
 

I conclude that the probability of having taken a
photo raph of Oswald during his visit(s) to the Cuban
onsulate on 27 September 1963 is remote.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Subject: LIONION Photographic Operation;
Targeted Against Cuban Consulate

SUMMARY

Available records show that the VLS-2, an automatic
camera device, was in process of being installed at the
LIONION basehouse on 27 September 1963. This device was
to be used with the K-100 16 mm. movie camera or the
Robot Star 35 mm. still camera. These systems were aimed
at the gate of the Cuban Consulate. The first test pictures
were sent to Headquarters as attachments to HMMA-22433 on
7 November 1963. One of the attachments, (A), shows the
VLS-2 coverage of the Consulate gate. Obvious in this
photograph is a sign indicating the hours of the Consulate
(for visas}. The hours are 10:00 to 2:00, Monday through
Friday. The date this test photograph was taken is un-
known. A later monthly report for 1 - 31 December 1963,
(HMMA-22726), discusses the installation of a SEQUENCE
camera on 17 December 1963 with hours of operation against
the Consulate 0900 to 1400, office hours of the Consulate.
Subsequent monthly reports confirm that the SEQUENCE camera
was indeed the Pulse Camera. The record, then, shows:

 

A. The Pulse Camera was installed, for the
first time, on 17 December 1963.

B. No coverage of the Consulate existed prior
to 27 September 1963 when the VLS-2 and
K-100 or Robot Star systems were being in-
stalled during the morning.
