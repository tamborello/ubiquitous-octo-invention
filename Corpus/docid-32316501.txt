INFORMANT PROGRAM
NEW YORK DIVISION

NY 4860-PC was interviewed on 2/24/88, 3/18/65,
3/31/65 and 4/23/65.

. To date, informant has not furnished any
information of value regarding the organized underworld's
activities. He willingly meets with SAS FRANK R. GERRITY and
JEROME N. BOWERS and appears cooperative about discussing
burglars, check passers, pimps and prostitutes, but has not
furnished any information of value concerning the above.

’ On 3/30/65, shortly after the EMILE GRIFFITH vs.
JOSE fight for the Welterweight Title, informant,
SEne ee rsation, said that STABLE was controlled by
"TONY "Pro™ OVENZAN

  

On 4/23/65, informant was specifically asked about
JOSEPH FARACCO aka - FUGITIVE; CRV, NY File 76-2663. Informant
said he knew subject as GEORGIE FARACCO and stated that we should
save our time and forget about looking for "Georgie". Informant
said that "Georgie" was "dumped" about two years ago. Informant
added that he is personally acquainted with "Georgie's" wife and

she believes her husband to be dead.

It is believed by the NYO that since informant
willingly meets with Special Agents and will discuss some
criminal matters, further efforts should be made to develop
this informant as an active top echelon eriminal informant .
