Mr. CISNEROS stated he listened to the re- a
cording but he did not know what significance it might
have since he could not understand it and therefore
he desired to turn it over to the FBI as possibly
being a coded message by anti-CASTRO-elements. He
said it would appear, or at least be his guess that

ibe fenfetccisn was being'’sent from the area

E cl bly directed to Cuba. Mr. CISNEROS
stated ALDO GIL at Littleton, Massachusetts could furnish
further details and also the name of the JURE member in
the Boston area who monitored and recorded the trans-

‘ mission. CISNEROS added he understands that other
Mo transmissions of a similar. nature have also been re-
corded by the member of JURE at Boston. He said the
, JURE delegation at Boston also possesses an identical

copy of the tape recording which CISNEROS turned over
to FBI, Miami. &
