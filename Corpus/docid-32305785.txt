LCN
MONTREAL, QUEBEC
CANADA

It has been previously reported that in January,
1965, STEVE MAGADDINO mentioned that he had "Been in Canada"
for hs years and specifically mentioned Montreal, Quebec,
as a location where he had considerable influence,

On April 8, 1968, BU T-16 advised that information
was received that on October 17, 1966, GIACOMO LUPPINO, of
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, suspected LCN member, and SANTO
SCIBETTA had visited Niagara Falls, New York, where a meeting
of about 45 minutes' duration took place between these men and
a member of the "Magaddino Family." BU T-16 furnished no
further information at this time concerning this meeting.

LON
INTERNAL DISSENSION

On August, 25, 1967, BU T-4 advised that leadership
in LCN was still vested in STEVE MAGADDINO, with FRED
RANDACCIO next in line to assume command of the "Family"
contingent. upon the outcome of the legal proceedings against
him.

“yn

On December 26, 1967, BU T-6 in discussing the likely
successor to RANDACCIO as Underboss,~ pointed out that such
discussion was pure speculation and that MAGADDINO would not
name a successor until all of RANDACCIO's appeals have been
exhausted. BU T-6 pointed out that if MAGADDINO should name
a successor before RANDACCIO's appeals were decided and
RANDACCIO was subsequently released from prison, a power
struggle leading to violence would probably evolve between
RANDACCIO and whoever was named as his successor,

BU T-6 stated that RANDACCIO is feared by most
of his underlings and actually hated by many of them.
Many members of the "Magaddino Family" are actually glad
that RANDACCIO is now in prison. BU T-6 pointed out that
the "Magaddino Family" was then without an "operating head"
in Buffalo and, as a' result, is in a disorganized state.
