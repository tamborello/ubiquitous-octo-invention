' RE: ROBERTO ALEJOS ARZU
INTERNAL SECURITY - GUATEMALA.
NEUTRALITY MATTERS

| ROBERTO ALEJOS ARZU, a wealthy Guatemalan National

i residing in Miami, Florida, during March and April, 1965,
planned an attempt to overthrow the Government of Guatemala;
however, on May 4, 1965, U. S. Customs Agents im Miami con-
fiscated arms which were to be used in this attempt.

MM T-1, a Cuban exile who has been involved in
revolutionary activities for the past five years,on June 21,
1965, advised that he had been in contact with ALEJOS and no
additional developments or significant happénings transpired
concerning ALEJOS’ possible future plans against the
Guatemalan Government. ALEJOS did indicate that he would
only need about ten Cuban exiles from the Miami area in con-
nection with his next attempt against the Guatemalan Government.

MM T-2 has been active in Cuban revoluationary
matters for the past six years and on June 22, 1965, advised
of the following information:

GERALD PATRIC Nanas, an irresponsible adventurer
and soldier of fortune, jthat date claimed he had been in
touch with ALEJOS and dad attempted to convince him that he,
HEMMING, should be in charge of ALEJOS’ military plans and
do the recruiting for ALEJOS’ next attempt against Guatemala.
HEMMING said he would attempt to sell ALEJOS* plans to the
Government of Guatemala and expected a representative of the

(P-Gnatenatan Gevernment to arrive in Miami in the near future.

On June 28, 1965, MM T-2 stated that HEMMING has
not since mentioned ALEJOS or the Guatemalan representative
and it is doubtful he has had any further contact with
ALEJOS or ever met with a representative ef the Guatemalan
Government .
