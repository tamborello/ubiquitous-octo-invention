ADMINISTRATIVE:

On 11/23/64, NY 3936-C advised SA WILLIAM A.
VERICKER that he had received information that SALLY BURNS
is attempting to settle some difficulties in NY for JAMES
HOFFA. The informant advised that he had been told that
HOFFA is in trouble with the "wise guys" in NY and if
GRANELLO is able to settle this situation, he will be able
to obtain anything he desires from HOFFA. The informant was
unable to pinpoint the source of HOFFA's trouble.

The informant further statedthat on 11/20/64,
BURNS met with TONY PROVENZANO in an endeavor to negotiate
some loans from the Teamsters Pension Fund. However, in
the event that any positive action is taken relative to these
proposed loans, PROVENZANO will not handle the loans for
GRANELLO.

information that on 11/13/64, BURNS was supposed to pay an
unidentified individual in Nassau County the sum of $25,000
to "fix" the current extortion case pending against BURNS

GRANELLO was only able to raise $10,000 of this sum and
would pay off that amount of money. NY 3936-C was unable
to ascertain the source of this sum of money.

mentioned data and the strong possibility. that the informant
might be compromised should this information be disseminated,
