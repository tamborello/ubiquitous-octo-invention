Re: Ilando CAPOLINO - Brooklyn, N.Y.; oS
Guido CAPOLINO - Brooklyn, N.Y.;
Samuel (Sam) MANNARINO -

New Kensington, Pa.

In October 1965 our Prince George Detachment
in British Columbia received information from a confi-
dential source that the three captionally noted persons

7. met in the interior of British Columbia during September
23 to 25, 1965, using a hunting trip as a "cover".

 

20 According to information received, the two

CAPOLINO brothers arrived in Prince George, B.C. in

the pam. of September 16, 1965, via Canadian Pacific

Airlines from Edmonton. They stayed in the Prince

George Hotel during the night of September 16th and

on either September 17th or 18th were flown by private

plane (Northern Mountain Airlines Limited, Prince George,

B.C.) to a hunting lodge on Warwa Lake in the interior of

B.C. From Warwa Lake the CAPOLINOs then proceeded to

Belcourt Lake, B.C., on September 23, 1965. When the

CAPOLINOs and party arrived at Belcourt Lake, they were ;
met by another aircraft which contained another hunter a Lea
and a big game guide named JohmyCALLIOU of Kelly Lake, (@"7°"%
B.C. Investigation has indicat that the hunter waiting

at, Belcourt Lake may have been Samuel (Sam) MANNARINO of

New Kensington, Pa, When the CAPOLINOs arrived, they

were warmly greeted by the hunter believed to be MANNARINO.
These three persons then proceeded to remain in close
company for one and a half days and were observed to
engage in secret conversations, separate from other
persons in the hunting party. The feeling was that. the

CAPOLINOs and MANNARINO had pre-arranged this meeting.
The CAPOLINO brothers and MANNARINO departed company
on the morning of September 25th when they continued
on their separate ways to hunt big game.

3. Investigation in B.Oy, revealed that Sam MANNARINO
of New “SoARSER Pa., Albert AHANNA of New Kensington,’ Pav,

 

 

and Dr, D.HA\SCHUMAHER of Road..#2,..Leidberg,.. BC yr, were
hunting in the interior of B.C. ring dain
question and were guided by Johnn YXCALLIOU “ Fithérmore,

the CAPOLINOs were overheard to meAtion that the man they

met at Belcourt Lake was caught in the Apalachin Mountains
during a Mafia meeting. This, therefore, led our investi-
gators to believe that the hunter met by the CAPOLINOs was
Samuel MANNARINO.

Le Our records indicate that Samuel MANNARINO is
subject of your FBI #115840, born 1-Jan-06, Pittsburgh,
Pa. MANNARINO's last known address was 20] Highland ~
Avenue, New Kensington, Pa., and his brother Gabriel ‘
MANNARINO, born 31-Oct-16, New Kensington, Pa., was an \
Apalachin delegate. Gabriel MANNARINO is subject of your
FBI #854-850, our FPS #889382. Samuel MANNARINO, you will
recall, was arrested by your Department in connection with

the Brockville Bank and Trust Company robbery in 1959-60.

 

5 The following particulars were obtained on the
CAPOLINO brothers: - ,

1) TIlando CAPOLINO - born about 1923.

6, Investigation on the CAPOLINO brothers revealed
that they previously hunted in the interior of British

were in search of property in B.C. in order that they might
escape the influence of the Mafia in the United States.
