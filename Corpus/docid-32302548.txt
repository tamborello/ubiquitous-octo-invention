On 6/26/61, PG 615-6 advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, IIL
as follows: ; .

The imminent incarceration of the convicted defendants
4n the. "GUN CASE (STUART SUJOR, ET AL; TGP; ITSP;
“FFA; NM; CONSPIRACY)! has caused some consternation in
the MANNARINO mob leadership. On Saturday, 6/24/61,
SAM MANNARINO, while at the Bonfire Restaurant near
‘Leechburg, Pa.,said that it was a real plow to lose

 

NORMAN ROTHMAN, Miami, Fla.,

who is a top-flight

Cuban contact-man; JOSEPH "RED"
pa., who is a first-rate fence;

“GIORDANO of New Kensington,

and even DANIEL "SPEEDO"

HANNA of Arnold, Pa.,

who is very efficient as a gambling
dealer and "Strong-arm" enforcer collector. Ty

MANNARINO

said the loss of these men would create some hard-to-fill
openings. For instance, to take HANNA's place, two men
were considered so far, JOE HORGAN and AL SPISANO,

both of New Kensington, but while elther man would make
a fair dealer, neither was physically or mentally

 

 

 

 

constituted for strong-arm work.
