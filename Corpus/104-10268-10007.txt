Today, Friday, March 27, 1964, I mot at CIA hendgquarie:s with
- Me. Rocca to review the CIA filo on Lec Harvey Oswald. The file
-conteins those materials furnished to us previously by CIA. in
eddition, it. contains the following materials: .

. a. Cable reports from the CIA station in Mexico of Novenber

i 22 and 23, 1963 relating to photographs of a person who had visited

! the Cuban ond Soviet Exvbassics in Mexico City during October and ;

bo ; Novenber. 1953; and reports on these cables furnished on Hovesber : oo
| : 23 by CIA to the Sceret Service. These messaves are accura :

: paraphrased in the attachments to tho CIA meworondur of March eh,

1954 {Comission Document ; Z6T4). ; ;

b. Cable of October 10 froa crA Honico City station to CIA
headquarters reporting on Oswald contact at Soviet Embassy, and -
October 10, 1963 message from CIA headquarters to Mexico City station
or background information on Oswald. Whese messages are accurately
reported in the CIA memorandum of January 31, 1964.

i I did not xeview any materiale later than Noverber 23, 1963.

. Mr. Rocca also showed me the “printout” of the references to
Oswald documents in the CIA electronic data storage system. There

was no ite: listed which we have not been Given either in full text
or paraphrased.

When I evidenced an interest in the CIA olectronic data
processing system, Mr. Rocca said that he would arrange. & detailed
explanation at a future visit. . . %-

7) From all the evidence on hand, we deduce that
CSWALD visited the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City on
patrmg pf. 27 Sepesmber 1963 and again come tice

after big initial visit, and that this later visit was ax
the afternooa of a day on which the Cuben Conga taloe
Pound the Soviet Comaulate shaw OSWALD ‘'s visa
prebiem, This may well have been 29 September, but
we canact be certain af this conckusion,

4, We 2e net keow whether Cubsn Consulate
erchives contained information on CSWALD ante~
dating bis Segbember-Octeber 1963 visit. From the
Statermesio of Siivia DURAN, one could conchae that
vhe had never heard of CSWALD until be visited the

this would mean that eo one there could sponser him,
