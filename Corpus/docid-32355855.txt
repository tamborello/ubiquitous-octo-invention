BACKGROUND

1. On 3 January 1963 Quinton N. OUSLER tumed-over the
responsibllities of inside Station control of the LIMOPOR Project
to Marvin A, CABOT during a meeting held with the outside Staff _
Agent for the LIMOIOR Project, Seymour D, TRINNICH, What follous
is the first in a series of Progress Reports which it is hoped
will not only serve to keep Headquarters advised of Just what
1s going on in the LIMOTOR Project but will also serve to apprise
Headquarters in greater detail of the performance of the LIMOTOR |
Staff Agent on the outside under student cover. During the
period under review TRINNICH's replacerant, Natalie S, MICHNOFF
arrived to take over the outside responsibilities for LINMOTOR,

In the future regular Progress Reports on LIMOTOR will. be
submitted on a quarterly basis,

area, They have code names and were chosen to allow for maximza
chaak of pessible counter-surveilimee (use of me~my streets,
ote.). CAROT tusges TRINNICH at, the predetermined site at a
predetermined tise and ultimately picks-up TRIMGCH fin his aP
vehicle. These meetings are then held in CABOT's car. Tro
special exergensy meeting altes have been seleeted but never
used; one 1s clase to TRINNICH's residance, and the other elese
te the UNAM

3. As can be seen fron the mumber of uestings helé in a .
seven month period, they were ususlly held once a week, TRINNICH's
seatings with the other LINOTOR assets were so arranged to allow
for a minisam passage of tire between the Meld agents seotings
and the meoting with CAROT, Tha TRINNICH-CADOT zactings usually
last, on the average, too hours. Specifle requiresents were
passed end eduinistrative matters wre attended to, Usually
TRINNICH reviewed with CABOT each report received Prom the LIMODOR
agents and inewdilabe guidentce is given where possible. Since
these meetings were WUIIICH'’s only contact with the Station,
Geliterate efforts were unde to keep him abreast of gener}
Station develonmmte as well as EURARK developments. This has
proven to be a distinet advantage from the standpoint of the
outelde Staffor's morale, making him feel mich more part of the
Station and whet it is trying to accomplish.

4, ‘TRINMICH is turn hed predesigmtsd reeting sites for
LIERTOR's 18, 19, amd 22, similar to those eited in paragraph 2 above,
and picked up his agents in his QP vehicle. Effective 7 March
TROINICH began preparetion of contact reports with each of hia
agente. In tum LIMOTOR-14 vas instrueted to prepare a short
repost on each of his meetings with LIELBROIL-2,

OPERATIONAL

5. Since Jamary 1963, the Station has attemted, throuzh
its regular contact with Seymeur D. TRINNICH, to gain further
insight into Just what mes on at the UNAM which is of interest
to the Station, and at the same time to examine the LIMOTOR
assets and their capabilities in terms of the UNAM. The LINOTOR
project is, as stated in tha Project Renewal, an important
Station “eyes and ears" mestanism at the UIAK, Based on a Look
at LIMCIOR for the period under review the Station notes the

Go. .&& the beginning of the period under review, the LIMOTON

- atshle consisted of the following assets:

LIRGIOR-LA (uho maintained contact with LIEMBROIL-?
. and LIKAYAK~63 the letter earved as a
contact to LIRMGROYL’s 3 ang 4)

LIHOTOR-19
LIMOTOR-22

At an early stage in the TRINNICH-CALOT relationship, i.e., ot
the 24 January seeting, steps were initiated via LINOFOR-14 to
{ aesemplish the termination of LIMAYAK=-6 end LIEYBROIL’s 3 end - Job
. & for Inck of prefuction, This wis Pinally cemleted effective : 2
the end of March 1963, Although a bid for drep or termination . . ‘
7 pay was made, it was pajected. In order to provide LIKAYAK-6
Vor with a mane of contaat Gould scmthing of importanes develop
-. in the future, LIMOTOR-14 was instrusted te acquire a Post
Office. Boz, whieh be did. It was taken out in the alias used
by LIMOPOR-1N with EIRAYAK-6 (Pedro MORAN) and also the altas
used by LINOTOR-28 with LIEPBROIL-2 (Huge de la Torre} as an
exergancy saans of centaet (using a telegram).

7. As a matter of operational background, Seyzour D, TRERNICH
vas know to LIMOTOR's 18, 19, and 22 under his truo agne, They
" ales lnew bis hore telephone number which wan used for commmtcations
' from them to him, LIPOTOR-1%' was unaware of the existence of
LIMOTOR’a 29 and 22, He knaw OUSLER under his trua niches.
- Although LIFOTOR’s 19 and 22 mew each other slightly socially,
‘they were unaware of each othors clandestine relationship with
' TROGSICH, LIMGTOR-19 knew Phineas F, SLINKARD through their
- @lere cooperation on the BRCHICK/BEKNAVE operation (under true
nama). LIMOTOR-19 also Inew OUSLER wndor true first name,

ras been a key writer for ane of the leading UNAM student
newspapers, Revolueionaric. He is well-versed in UAH
