1. According to OPLA-0174 IN 25921, 20 Sept 62, an untested
source reported driving in an easterly direction on Avenida 23,
Marianao, Habana, on 12. September 62, when he encountered a con-
voy of 20 Soviet-driven trucks pu i canyas-covered 65-70
féet_long trailers, proceeding west towards Ciudad Libertad.

Upon arrival at Ciudad Libertad, the militia jeep escort lead-
ing the convoy was waved off and the convoy entered the installa-
tion. Trailers were loaded with what source believed to be
large missiles which extended over the end of the trailer. Can-
vas, over what appeared to be wood framers, presented the
silhouette of what source believed were four fins on the trail—-
ing edge of the missile. The source drew sketches of the load
silhouette, which resembled a SURFACE-TO-SURFACE. SS-4 "SHYSTER" .

TFW/Intel R/Comment: The SS-4 "SHYSTER" is a single stage,
vertically. launched, liquid propellant, medium range ballistic
missile with a range of 500 to 700 nautical miles.

 
 

2.- In March 1962 two amphibious tracked carriers were
observed at. the military garrison of Jovellanos, Matanzas
Province. Uncovered rockets were visible on the carriers
where canvas covers had been rolled up and secured with straps
at the side of the rockets. (Field Comment: Source identified
the above rocket im a technical manual as a FROG rocket, quali-

. fying the identification by saying that altho the rocket .was
mounted on a tracked amphibious carrier, it did not appear to
have the bulbous tip shown in the photograph but, rather, the
rounded configuration of a 45. cal bullet.) (TDCSDB-3/651,616,
5 October 62).

TFW/Intel R/Comment: The FROG (Free Rocket Over Ground) is an
unguided field artillery rocket mounted on a modified JS tank
chassis, sometimes confused with the SS-1 guided SURFACE-TO-
SURFACE missile "SCUD", which is also mounted on the same
chassis. The FROG has a range of 70,000 yards or 64,000 meters.
(OPLA-0174,. IN-25921, 20 September 62).

3, At 1100 hours 9 August 62 an untested source observed
numerous Soviet vehicles between Placetas and La Esperanza,
Las Villas Province, proceeding northwest on the Central Highway.
The vehicles in the convoy consisted of 20-25 large Soviet
trucks and Low-Boy type trailers, about 15 of which were trans-
porting JS model tanks, one “tank-like vehicle of tracked .
mobility with long -canvas—covered rectangular object mounted
on top of tank frame, possibly identifiable as a JS tank
chassis modified for transport of ROCKETS or SURFACE-TO-SURFAC E
MISSILES, or Bridge-Laying purposes." All convoy personnel
were apparently young Soviet types.
(TFW/Intel R/Comment: A-canyas-covered tank chassis would have
approximately the same configuration for a bridge-laying unit , FROG
Rocket, or ‘S8-1 "SCUD'Surface-to-Surface GM, The SCUD is a single
stage, solid propellant, GM mounted on the modified :chassis of the
3S tank series. The "SCUD" has a, maximum range of 75 to 100. nautical
miles; the nearest US ean arene is the Corporal. : . :

4. Two flat-bed trailers were joined together in order
to transport a 1,000 mile range rocket. The vehicles departed
Santiago de Cuba (no date given) in the direction of Palma
Soriano, Oriente Province. (TDCS-3/525,272, 16 October 1962)

5. On 4 or 5 July 1962 an untested source reported ob-
serving a cleared area approximately 50 meters square, at SOROA,
Pinar del Rio Province. Along steel object constructed of
girders, was on the flatbed of a trailer truck, and one end of
the object was attached to the trailer bed, while the other end
was attached to a heavy chain & hook suspended from a truck-

\ mounted crane parked nearby. The object appeared.as if it might
be a launcher of some type, and was approximately 50 feet long.
More than a dozen "cylindrical metal tubes, approximately 30'
long and 18-20" wide, were on the ground near the object.
(00-K-3/118,381, 31 August 1962)

In August 1961 an untested source had reported a missile or
rocket-launching site and a large underground storage room or
tunnel on the ranch of Dr. Jose "Pepe" Avita, near Soroa, in
one of three high hills in the immediate area.
(00=K-3,193,688, 18 August 1962)

6. On 19 September 1962, according to an untested source,
large Intercontinental Rockets, over 20 meters long, were un-
loaded from the ship. (Headquarters Comment: It is more likely
that. source observed SA-2 missiles being offloaded.)

7. At 0700 hours 18 September 1962, and.at 1200 hours
17 September 1962, trains stopped at the Victoria de las Tunas
(Oriente) railroad station, On each occasion the trains were
transporting equipment "which lookéd like missiles, and other
equipment. which might have been big generators. The missiles
were deseribed as “about 25 to 30 feet. long, and about 3 to
3h feet in diameter. The missiles were in open flatcars, and
each car was carrying two of these. missiles, There was no way
to determine the destination of the trains. On 17 or 18
September two farmers were overheard talking in Tunas de Zaza
about a.rocket base being constructed at Las-Mercedes, near
Niquero. (TFW Field Comment: Sources were shown pictures of
the SS-4, which appeared in the Army Tech man . The sources
said, in essence, "the weapon they saw was s hat similar to
the 38-4, however, was only about 25 to 30 feet’ long and had a
much plunter. nose section. (UFG-1657, 9 October 1962).

(TFW/Intel/R Comment: The SS-4 "SHYSTER" is a single stage,
vertically launched, liquid propellant, medium ballistic missile,
similar in many ways to the US Redstone. The SS-4 SHYSTER has

a range of 500 to 700 nautical miles.) :

   

-* 8. According to The Cuban Report, publis by the Students
Revolutionary Directorate, 28 September 1962, ami, "one of the
principal Soviet strongholds in Matanzas. Provi .» AScvin the
Yumuri Valley, about 1 mile from the north coast of M&tanzas
Province, and about 5 miles west of the City of Matanzas. Its
construction was begun about a year and a half ago..." In some
of these tunnels can be found some equipment about 70 feet long
and 8 or 10 feet. in height. Their description forces us to
believe that they are ballistic missiles of intermediate range
(IRBM) of great destructive power...”
