Hardy Allegation

"The following day, I went to the FBI Office in
Camden and asked them for advice. I told them I
did not want my friends to go to jail. They told
me at the time, just to keep them posted on
developments. I then went to the group of people
I had just mentioned, and in a short time they had

taken me into their confidence as a member and
fellow sympathizer."

apparently worried about the 4th floor for some
reason or reasons unknown -to him.: He advised .
he did not know the exact details of how :
ANTOINETTE got into the building. +t

HARDY advised that he has been given an. assign-
ment to go into the Post Office] and get a detailed
floor plan of the 4th and Sth floors, specifically
looking. for any electrical tape, alarm systems

on the windows. HARDY made the observation that
they are going to come into the Post Office
through a window on the 5th floor. GRADY and

his group are concerned about the key system as~
far as security measures are concerned. They
want to jknow exactly where alarm systems are located
They also want to know how many windows and how
many windows ‘line up with other offices on the

uth floor in order that they can check the guard's
movements when they have the Post Office under
surveillance. CHARDY 's report to the FBI
following his meeting with GRADY's group on

June 29, 1971.) :

report to the FBI of his conversation with MIKE
ot on the afternoon of June 25, 1971.)

a considerable amount of surveillance on the

watching the night watchman make his rounds inside
the Post Office. HARDY felt that the break-in
will occur some time between l a.m. and 4 a.m.
ona Monday morning. ;

He was coming to the FBI because he was \
troubled by something that-a good friend ‘of his
(MIKE GIOCONDO) was trying to get him involved
in. GIOCONDO had approached him concerning a
"draft board demonstration like the one the
BERRIGANS were involved in.

Paragra hn 3

GIOCONDO wanted his assistance in finding places
for large groups of people to stay overnight,

in finding a meeting hall, and the use of his
truck. (He assumed that the truck would be

used to move groups of people. His truck could
transport up to 20 people at one time.) GIOCONDO
mentioned that there are about 25 people in the
area who are working on the matter and that
there are about 200 more whe will be coming to
the area from New York State and Pennsylvania
to provide assistance. The planning has been
going on for about 6 to 8 weeks, and GIOCONDO
has told him that many of the “ex-religious"
people involved in the movement are people who
have been known to both GIOCONDO and him for

quite some time.

STATEMENT OF ROBERT W. HARDY
BEFORE THE HOUSE SELECT
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
NOVEMBER 18, 1975

On Tuesday, November 18, 1975, Robert W. Hardy
appeared before the House Select Committee (HSC) dealing
with the subject matter of intelligence activities and
made a statement concerning his performance as an informant
for the FBI. In this statement, Mr. Hardy made certain
allegations against the FBI which are set out below with
appropriate responses.

The succeeding pages set out each of Mr. Hardy's
allegations which are excerpts from his testimony. Each
allegation is followed by a refutation. Except where spec~
ifically noted, these responses to Mr. Hardy's allegations
are excerpted from the FBI report of Special Agent Michael M.
Ryman at Philadelphia dated November 18, 1971, entitled, “Camden
Action; Jayma Ann Abdoo; Et Al.“ This report is a chronological
compilation of debriefings prepared following the daily meetings
of Hardy with the FBI Agents assigned as his contacts. The
report is attached. The refutations of Mr. Hardy's testimony

are, therefore, in the main taken from his own con
reports to the FBI. Femporary
