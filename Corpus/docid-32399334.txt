(om Operational ;
§ SPECIFIC Field Traces on Subjecte of HRS-W-1326 NP:

Reference: HRS-W-1326 of 3 September 1957 -

1. The files. of all appropriate Panama and Canal: Zone agencies were re-.

viewed for information ‘concerning the Subjects of reference, as ;

_ requested therein. The.only agency with information on Subjects wis
HYAFFIX, and a verifax copy of that organization's file is forwarded
as a separate cover attachment to this dispatch for the information of
KUSODA, Information available in Station files was solely that con-
tained in information copies of HYAFFIX reports. Station realizes
that the information contained in paragraph 2 of reference was undoubt-
edly based on these same HYAFFIX reports and therefore does not
necessarily constitute confirmation. As will be noted, Subjects have

_- mot been a matter of record in files of any local agencies since
“May 1945. ao

2. In view of the elapsed time since Subjects were employed in Panama,
current investigation was not deemed feasible.

~3. Headquarters may provide Stetions San Jose and Habana with copies of |
’ the separate cover HYAFFIX file at its discretion.
