recorded interviews’ conducted by CIA representatives with
AMMUG/1 are absent from the files provided thus far to the
Committee. These twenty-two reels of tape recordings were
listed as attachments to the above-referenced CIA dispatch.

fhe actual interviews from which the tape recordings were
generated were conducted shortly after AMMUG/1's defection

from the Cuban Intelligence Service. Furthermore, three trans-—
scripts of tape recorded CIA interviews with AMMUG/1 are absent
from the files thus far provided to the Committee. These
transcripts were listed as attachments to a CIA-originated re-
port of 30 April 1964. The actual interviews‘upon which the
transcripts are based were also conducted shortly after AMMUG/1's
defection from the Cuban Intelligence Service.

In the case of Luisa Calderon's CIA files, CIA informa-
tional reports, cables, and dispatches yeferenced to in her 201
file have been found to be absent from that file. In addition,
a CIA transcript of a telephone conversation in which she par-
ticipated on the day of President Kennedy's assassination is
absent from her 201 file. ‘

fhe absence of these reports, notes, memoranda, and other
material from the AMMUG/1 files and the Luisa Calderon files
reviewed to date may be an indication that other related
materials have not yet been made available to the Committee for
review.

The Committee therefore reiterates its request that all
files and index references on Luisa Calderon and AMMUG/1, in-
cluding but not limited to production files, operational files,
soft files and subject files, be made available to the Commit-
tee as soon as possible.

The Committee further requests that AMMUG/1 CIA case
officers Harold Swenson, and Barney Hidalgo, FNU Langosch, and
Daniel Flores be made immediately available for personal inter-
views with Committee staff members.

As some of the matters discussed herein may be of a
sensitive or classified nature, this communication may require
appropriate classification.

Thank you for your continued cooperation.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Breckinridge:

Po
I write in reference to the Committee's requests of 6 P
June 1978 and 8 June 1978 that the Central Intelligence Agency
make available for review by Committee staff members all files
and index references to the following individuals:

Luisa Calderon
AMMUG/1

During the week of 2 July 1978, various files concerning
the above-named individuals were made available for review to
Charlies Berk of this Committee. Mr. Berk has now reviewed
Luisa Calderon's 201 file and AMMUG/1's Office of Security file,
Office of Personnel file, and Volumes One and Two of AMMUG/1's
201 file covering the period 25 April 1964 - October 1965.

After a careful review of these materials, it has been
determined that CIA-originated reports of 5 May 1964, 6 May «ple
1964, 7 May 1964, 8 May 1964, 11 May 1964, and 19 June 1964,

Gach based upon AMMUG/1's knowledge, are absent from the /
materials provided to Mr. Berk. Furthermore, neither notes nor
memoranda upon which these reports may have been based are

present in the files. The content of these reports, notes and
memoranda are of substantial interest to the Committee. It has
also been determined .that AMMUG/1 material now stored by the

CLA at its Warrenton, Virginia facility has not been made fully
available to the Committee. This omission came to Mr. Berk's
attention inadvertently during a conversation that he had with
Chris HopkinSv—— NOt  -
