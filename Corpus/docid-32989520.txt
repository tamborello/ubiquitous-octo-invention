Senator Tower. What criteria do you use in the selection

of informants?

Mr. Wannall. Well, the eriteria vary with the ‘needs. In-
our cases relating to extremist matters, surely ia order to get
an infoxrmant who can mela into a gxoup which is engaged ina
criminal type activity, you're going to have a different set
of criteria. If you're talking about our internal security
matters, I think we set rather high standards. We do require | Ves
that a preliminary inquiry be conducted which would consist
principally of checks of our headquarters indices, our field
office indices, checks with other informants who are operating
in the same area, and in various establishea sources such as
local police departments.

Following this, if it appears that the person is the type

| who. has. credibility, .can.be depended’ upon to be reliable, we

would interview the individual in order to iiake a determination
as to whether or not he will be willing to assist:the FBI
in discharging its responsibilities. in. that. fiela.

Following that, assuming that the. answer is positive, we
would conduct a rather in depth. investigation for. the. purposé
of. further attempting to establish credibility and. reliability.

Senator. Tower, “Wow. does. the. Bureau. distinguish between

the. use of informants. for law enforcement as opposed to

. intelligence. collection?

Is the guidance different, or is: it the same, or what?

Mr. Wannall. Well, Mr. Adams can probably best address
the use of informants on criminal matters since he is over
the operational division on that.

Mr. Adams. You do have somewhat of a difference in the fact
that a criminal, informant in a law enforcement function, you
are trying to develop evidence which ‘will be admissible in
court for prosecution, whereas with intelligence, the informant
alone, your purpose could either be prosecution or it could be
just for purposes of pure intelligence,

The difficulty in both is retaining the confidentiality

of the individual and protecting the individual, and trying to,

through use of the informant, obtain evidence which could be
used independently of the testimony of the informant so that
he can continue operating as a criminal informant.

Senator Tower. Are these informants ever authorized to
function as provocateurs? , ,

Mr. Adams. No, sir, they ‘re not. We have strict regula-
tions against -using informants as provocateurs. This gets
into that delicate area of entrapment which has been addressed
by the courts on many occasions and has been concluded by the

courts that providing an individual has a willingness to engage

in an activity, the government has the xight to provide him the |,

opportunity. This does not mean, of course, that mistakes don'

occur in this area, but we take whatever steps we can to

‘avoid this, Even the law has recognized that informants can
