work activities in Chile that she knew of were
writing and painting. She said he told her he
‘was a physigian and owned a clinic in Miami,
Florida, RU

"His son, ORLANDO, 15, of Miami, visited him
in Chile for about 20_.days in October 1975, she
said, She said BOSCH left Chile for about five days

. around the middle of last, year, but she did not
say where he went,

"Referring to BOSCH's reasons for being in
Chile, she said: ‘He told me that he was here in Chile
| because, I don't ‘know, it was more peaceful, because
i he liked it . . : Lu rstood that he didnttwant to
talk about that,’ 75 C5)

"She said she did not know of any contacts other

than casual ones that he might have had with’ Chileans,

\ - tand I prefer, not to know at this time,* BX)

"She emphasized: ‘He is a very correct person who

loves his fatherland very much--that is his only defect, WY
"BOSCH was.detained in Venezuela for questioning

about the explosion of a Cuban airliner that killed 73

. persons two weeks ago. 5)

\
\

"The Washington Post said Thursday that he was expelled
from Costa Rica in May for using a; false Chilean passport,‘

 

\
c advised that discreet inquiries
had estabPished the identity of SCH AV, ‘gs mistress, who had. b
interviewed by_LONG, as ADRIAN, LGADO
advised that DELGADO had 1o0Véd from the San Borja Towers address €
another location in Santiago beiteved to be Calle ‘San Francisco 15

 

 

    
   
  

 

ion . : Obviously DELGADO would: have - -yaluable information concernil
Cuban exile contacts who visited BOSCH in Santiago during the year
he resided in that city, When photographs of all known Cuban exile
members in the continental United States and Puerto Rico known to
have visitéd BOSCH in Chile are received by Legat, Buenos Aires,
arrangements will- be made for an in-depth interview with DELGADO
during which the photographs will be displayed in an effort ‘to
elicit complete information concerning these individuals and their

activities in Chiles Gwe) uw)

invited to Section XXVI Gi xeWEonep L whlch contains a partial 4
text of a report dated 10/8/76 prepared by the Ad Hoc Working
Group on situations of human rights in Chile, United Nations
General Assembly, This report contained information concerning
DINA, which in some instances is obviously incorrect and based
on rumors and heresay. For example, Page 296 of rerep indicates
that DINA Headquarters and office of DINA Director was located
on Marcoleta Street in Santiago at the former offices of the
Chilean Communist Youth, As previously reported, DINA Headquarters
and the DINA Director's Office are located at \Ll Calle Belgrado,. .

 

in Santiago would be able to take a passenger to DINA Headquarters
‘on request, From the nature ofinformation contained in this

report, it appears that the Ad Hoc Working Group compiled information
volunteered by various Chilean dissidents concerning DINA operations
in Chile, Nonetheless, an extremely intoresting piece of informa-
tion is contained. on Page 300 of rerep, which identifies various

DINA premises in Santiago, One of the locations identified as a 4
DINA situs is listed in Paragraph (D) as an apartment in the San
Borja Housing Project. As noted in the above Associated Press
dispatch, BOSCH AVILA resided with his Chilean mistress at the

San Borja Towers Housing Development, e)

 

: It would be extremely significant if it could be established
with any degree of certainty that BOSCH’s apartment, was in fact

a location utilized by DINA, Accordingly, it is suggested that’ WFO

or the New York Office give consideration to ascertaining from

the Ad Hoc Committee Working Group whether thé exact location of

the alleged DINA apartment in the San Borja Housing Project can be
identified and if possible the source, who identified the apartment

as a DINA location be located and interviewed. ts)

AL shou e noted - thatl. advisec¢
that invésTigatio sclosed the exact qddress of BOSCH AVT nd .
sis

his Ghilean mistr' ‘S$ apartment as Building #1 Apartment #24,
Torres de San Borja, Alameda, Santiago, Chile. (x)
