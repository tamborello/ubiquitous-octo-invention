\

; It is noted that considerable information has been
developed in recent months regarding the existence of La Cosa
Nostra and the identities of leaders and members in your division.
A great deal of this information has come from MI 623-C-TE, who
for many years has been personally acquainted with a number of
important Cosa Nostra figures in the Springfield area.

You are to carefully review this and other pertinent
material and advise the ‘Bureau by 11/12/64 of your plans to
maintain a thorough and continuing project to fully develop your
investigation of La Cosa Nostra in the Springfield Division. As 2
has been noted previously, the lack of information on the 8,
prevalence of La Cosa Nostra existence and activity in a given
area cannot be construed to mean that it does not exist in such
a locale, but rather, innany instances, that there are no
available highly placed sources capable of furnishing reliable
data on this phenomenon in the organized underworld, as recent
experience in your division has again illustrated.

 

In order to fully develop our intelligence picture
of La Cosa Nostra nationally, it is necessary that each office
_ covering an area having La Cosa Nostra membership and exist ie,
‘completely determine the make-up of such a group locally, a
its relationship to more important "families" and/or the
' "*¢Gommission."

This matter is to receive immediate attention and you
are to establish logical and continuing investigative procedures
volson______ Which will enable~gou to ot REC. 44 the coverage necessary in this
