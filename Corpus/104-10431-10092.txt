Oana VLADIMIROVICH KOSTIKOV — .

1. Please refer to our conversation of 6 May. KOSTIKOV, born 17 March)
1933, Moscow, was posted to Beirut in 1978 as lst Secretary _and may stilD

be there. He is identified KGB_and served in Mexico City from rom 1961-71)

There is a reference to him on page 307 of BARRON's KGB which suggests)
that he may have been Department_V. |

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. We also note that EPSTEIN in "Legend" claims that accerding to a CIA
telecheck KOSTIKOV was Lee Harvey OSWALD's KGB case officer in Mexico City.
According to BARRON (page 335) OSWALD was in Mexico between September and
November 1963 and was seeking to obtain a Soviet visa. There was certainly
a KGB interest in OSWALD, although according to NOSENKO this was defensive.

 

 

 

3. The reason for our current interest in KOSTIKOV will be obvious, A
you are aware, our Embassy in Beirut, in common with other Western Missions}
has been-subjeét threats and violence iin recent months, and in view o

earlier hostile attentions from the KGB, we have been reviewing our records)
tacti

of KGB staff in the area who might have’ been involved in promoting strong-arm)

 

 

"4. We would be grateful for your views as to whether the KGB are likely to)
be behind any of the recent incidents (possibly through the Syrians) and fox
any information on KOSTIKOV and his activities in Mexico and in Beirut. Xn |

i particular, what are your comments on the OSWALD story; can you confirm that
KOSTIKOV is still in Beirut; is there anyone else in Bejrut—or_Damascus_whos:
trace record suggests an Active Measures role, or worse’

 

 

 

 

 

    

 

5. We should be grateful for_an early ‘reply and as I said on 6 May will treat)
anything you | can tell us on a_ “strictly Service ta Service besie
_ ice FILE COPY. FOR (Yours ever)
