necessarily been released for public review in their entirety.

Under the JFK Act, originals to all material deemed
assassination records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of |
whether the material is open in full or released with information

The copies contained within the previously mentioned
file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date
