~s

At the request of Mr. Fred Bucci of 0S, a review was made of
Bubject's file to determine if there is any indication of an alleged
: acquaintance between Subject and one DEBORD (phonetic). The inquiry
; originated with WH Division who called Mr. Bucci for information because
A ith Project JMWAVE. Subject was approved as 6

in January 1968. The Division had heard
a Primer that BUD yee @usinted with one DEBORD (phonetic) who was

“close to GARRISON® (District Attorney Jim GARRISON of New Orleans). AU
review of Subject's 08 file proved negative.

 

 
 

The undersigned also reviewed the security file (#¢ 241598) of
; Lawrence J. LA BORDE whose son, Michael, furnished information to
GARRISON. ‘he results of this review were aleo negative. (Copy of
summary on LA BORDE prepared for the GARRISON Case ie attached).

The only similarity of information in the two files which might
be considered as a possibility only of such acquaintance is as followg:
Subject was employed as @ small boat operator with Project JMARC et —
Key West, Florida from January to September 1961. Lawrence J. LA BORDE
was granted a Provisional Covert Security Approval in March 1961 for use
as a maritime asset for Project JMATE in the Miemi, Florida area.

Mr. Bucci advised he would furnish the undersigned any additional
information that might develop that would involve Subject in the sRrsoH
investigation.

AnFEI report of Auzust 1652 stated that Subject had duped
certain persons into buying a schooner, the "Elsie Riechart,” by
eleiring that he and u crew would operate it for Cuban operations
which would be paid for by the U. &. Government, although, the
Government could not openly acknowledge the support.

DETAILS: So oe

When LABORDE visited the Nev Orleans DCS office on 11 May 1967,
he 6afd he feared thet GARRISON would subpoena him and said he was
willing to leave the U. S&S. to avold a subpoena and that he wanted .
the DCS office to tell him what to do. Subject's visit wis believed
to be a provocation by GARRISON in an attempt to entrap CIA inte
advising Bubject te leave Louisiana. ‘This would beve buttressed
GARRISON's charge that CIA and the FBI are attempting to obstruct

the course of justice in New Orleans.
