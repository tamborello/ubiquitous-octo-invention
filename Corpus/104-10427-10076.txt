NOTE FOR : The Director LEO #78 202 / 3
FROM H Haviland Smith .

SUBJECT - : - The HSCA Investigation of the Mexico City Station

1. The memorandum from Scott Breckinridge, attached hereto, dated
15 June, addresses only one aspect.of our problem with the HSCA. In the

 

 

example, is ‘their telephone tap activity, the evidence from which will .be
an integral part of the HSCA's conclusions.

2. Mexico City is a focal point for Soviet intelligence operations
against the continental United States. There is a long, documentable history
of Soviet activities based ‘in Mexico being run into our Country. -The relation-
ship thatiwe have with the Mexican Security Service)ts a critical ingredient
in.our ability to protect ourselves. against. these Soviet -intelligence acti -
vities. You will recall that the Boyce-Lee. case was brought to our. attention

 

 

 

 

by of the Mexican government.. If, as we suspect, the Committee

the problems which are ‘inherent “in-an ultimate declassification and- publica-
tion of the sensitive information -they ‘have: gleaned -fram.aur files an general
intelligence activities. in Mexico City. This may not prove to be helpful
in dampening the ardor of the HCSA staff, but it most certainly will put
them on notice that the course they are taking will have direct repercussions
not only on CIA activities in Mexico City, but on our bilaterai relations
with that country. i
