It appears that the information concerning MIRR

plans, which was furnished on 4/26/66, by Lt. EDWIN M.

STER, JR.,U.S. Coast Guard, San Juan originated from
a GIA report dated 4/16/66, classified "Confidential,
entitled:"Plans of the MIRR To Sabotage.A Vessel in Miami
or Puerto Rico." This CIA report is based upon information
received fromja source described a s a member of a group of
Cuban emigres, trained in the techniques of information
collection. . it ‘related that on 4/12/66, JORGE GUTIERREZ

information from a non member of the MIRR who was acquainted
with ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA, head of the MIRR, that the :
MIRR planned to make an attempt to sink a Russian ship, however, bee
no mention was made of San Juan in this regard. tee

. MM 105-2855

 

 

On 4/11/66, MM 639-S advised that BOSCH had recently
remarked to one of his MIRR associates plans. relating to
guns and explosives, MM 639-S received the impression that
this remark related to his second plan, which BOSCH intended x
to carry out immediately after the plans which he was then
making for a raid against Cuba. (96)

It is to be noted that as of 4/11/66, BOSCH was mi
laying plans for a raid involving the use of a plane and a
bombs to strike a target at Nuevitas, Cuba. Upon the
basis.of information furnished by, MM 639-s, this raid was ;
aborted on 4/2//66, when BOSCH and two companioris, BARBARO BALAN, oo:
and JOSE ANTONIO MULET GONZALEZ, .aka GUAJIRO, were arrested at :
a roadblocky 15 miles east of Naples, Fla., by Collier
County deputies. Ge) (U) .

BOSCH and his companions had six loaded 100 pound aerial,
bombs in one of the automobiles. They had intended to load :
these bombs on a plane in naples, Florida airport for the _ ;
bombing raid, which was scheduled to take place that night .(K 1%)

Miami tas subsequently received no additional }
information concerning any specific plans by BOSCH, however, ;
in view of BOSCH's past performances, it is possible that _ |
he may make another bombing’ ox sabotage attempt in the immediate a
future. He is presently scheduled to face trial on extortion .
in Federal Court, Miami, 6/7/66. |

‘On 5/2/66, U.S. Customs, Miami, advised. that BOSCH
is also scheduled to face trial in Federal Court at Orimdo,
Fla., om charges of conspiring to violate the munitions
control act, ow s- 30-66.

In the event that Miami receives. any indication
that BOSCH may have plans affecting San Juan, the Bureau
and that office will be immediately notified.
