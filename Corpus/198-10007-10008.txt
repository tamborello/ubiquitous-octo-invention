CURRENT INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Alleged Cuban Arms Shipments to Venezuela
via British Guiana

1. There is no confirmation of reported Cuban
arms Shipments into British Guiana either for,.local -

 

up rice and could offload weapons without “detection
along the unguarded coast before reaching port. Once
in Georgetown harbor, all Cuban vessels are searched
by Guianese under nominal British supervision. Re-

orts of these searches:are made available through
poe Sito US authorities; all such reports to
date have been negative although . there are several
ways by which this inspection can: be evaded.

 

2.- Two Cuban . seamen who defected in Canada on

6 February have alleged that the Cuban merchant ship
BAHIA DE TANAMO has been smuggling Czech guns into
British Guiana destined ultimately for revolutionaries
in Venezuela, The BAHIA DE TANAMO did visit George-
town on 6-7 January and the BAHIA DE NIPE-~-rumored to
be smuggling arms in 1962-~-was there on 15-22 Janu-
ary. Both of these ships--the only two Cuban vessels
to go to British Guiana in January--are engaged in a
regular trade between the two countries. Since 1961
British Guiana has been selling rice to Cuba, and re-
cently added timber; Cuba sells cement to British
Guiana. Travellers have also used these ships occa-
sionally to enter the colony from Cuba and the ships
have picked up students for Cuba and onward transit
to the Soviet bloc.:

 

 

3. These ships could have carried weapons when
they left Cuba and it would be possible for them to
evade port inspection by first offloading any clandes-
tine arms into small boats somewhere along the

unguarded Guianese coast. The area on both sides of
‘the Venezuela ~ British Guiana border is almost un-
populated and is cut by many small creeks. This
would appear to be the most likely of many possible
ways for Cuba to ship arms into Venezuela without de-
tection. One unconfirmed report of last November
mentioned a discussion between Mikoyan and Castro
about an “economic treaty" between Cuba and British
Guiana that would provide for sending Cuban arms and
Sabotage experts to Venezuela via British Guiana.

4. It is generally believed that Cuban policy
is to avoid the actual shipment of arms to subver-
sive groups abroad on the theory that such groups
should be self~sustaining. Should Cuba feel the
Venezuelan situation ripe for an overthrow of Betan-

_ court, however, an exception might be made. No arms
which can be traced back to Castro provenance have
been detected in Venezuela, however.

. . 5. Neither the Venezuelans nor the British
patrol the coast. The British maintain no ships
in.the area; the Venezuelans have suitable patrol
craft but not in adequate numbers. As British Guiana
now has full internal self-government, inspections

in the Georgetown area are actually made by local per-
sonnel; the commissioner of police, however, is a
British national. Inspection in the countryside for
possible smuggled arms caches is not feasible because
both the local police. and the 600 British troops in
the country are concentrated in the Georgetown area.
However, |have: been cooper-
ating closely with their US counterparts and state
they have no evidence in support of press allegations
that Cuban arms are being sent into British Guiana.

 

 

 

6. An untested source in a position to know.
stated that in November Jagan's party decided to ac-
quire arms--—presumably from Cuba-~--and to start its
youth on a military training program, These plans,
as reported, involved military training in the party's
downtown headquarters. No such activity has yet been
noted, however.
