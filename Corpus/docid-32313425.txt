DETAILS: -

 

"(AT PORTLAND, OREGON:
On February.15, 1964, PD T-1 made available to the

. Portland Office ‘of. ‘the FBI copies of two publications which
. he had received ‘that date through the: malls ‘from "Minutemen,

Post Officé Box 68, Norborne, Missouri.."..Thesé publications
entitled "Special Bulletin" and. "On Target" are quoted below.

“SPECIAL BULLETIN (undated)

"The Minutemen Organization is now the object of an
intensive investigation. Apparently, this. is.part: of the
announced plan of the ‘Warren ‘Commission! to..investigate.
‘possible. connections. between ‘the radi¢al:.right: and the
‘assassination of President Kennedy. *:. - me

"All real patriots will recognize that such an impli-

~ cation is without foundation. If Robert. Kennedy had spent. as
‘much time investigating the communist-socialist. movement as
» he did in worrying about ‘the pro-American ‘movement, then his

brother would probably. still be alive.

"This will not. prevent the ‘conspiracy! (through
the use of the controlled news media) from trying to give the

death,

_impression that the right-wing is somehow to blame for ‘Kennedy's

“This 1s an extremely serious situation.

"Yost of our members will already be familiar with
the facts that Earl Warren has voted to favor the communists

. in almost every: case involving this nation's internal security

that has come before the Supreme Court since he has: been a

member of that body. -Most, too, will be aware that when Earl

Warren first heard of Kennedy's death that he immediately issued
a statement blaming the assassination on ‘right-wing fanatics. !
In fact, this investigating committee was set up just three days

. after the communist: newspaper, The Worker, made a suggestion

to that effect. The Worker also suggested that Earl Warren
be made the head of the committee exactly as-ocecurred. —

"Nicholas Katzenbach who was in charge of the Federal

Marshals at Oxford, Mississippi has been named as chief investi-

gator for the Warren Commission,
