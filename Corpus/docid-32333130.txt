SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, aka
AR f

Reuriet 11/7/61.

Your request for authority to make an installation
at LaRocca's home in Ingomar, Pennsylvania, appears to be
premature. Informants and other sources should be able to furnish
information as to where LaRecca conducts his racketeering activities
or the ‘identity of the person or persens who handle such affairs
for hin. -

The Bureau cannot at this time authorize tesurs on
matters such as this, however, if a kidnaping should occur or a
life is definitely in danger involving a substantive violation
over which we have jurisdiction, definite consideration would
be given to utilization of a tesur.

If you are able to develop facts indicating LaRocca
: uses his home” in connection with his. racketeering activities, it
\ would appear from your very detailed survey that consideration
\ _ ghould be . Siven to the use of a modified SPIT. :

Pittsburgh is endeavoring to establish an additional
on LaRocca since he has been alleged to be the "Big Boss"
Vito Genevese is in jail. oo
