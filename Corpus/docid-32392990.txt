L. BACKGROUND

The LIEMPTY Project is designed to collect operational infor-
mation on the LIMERICK installation and personnel, as well as targets of
opportunity, through ‘stationary and mobile photographic coverage, In addition,
the project provides the means for investigating leads from both the above
noted coverages and other Station sou rees, It supports other Station operations
through the renting of safehouses, providing and servicing post office box mail
drops, conducting countersurveillances and pretext investigations and perfor- ,
ming related tasks. .

   
 

9 OPERATIONS Se ee

 

LIEMPTY provides the majority of photographs used by the
: Station in its CE operations aga inst the LIMERICK «a rget. In this phase of
i the operation the LIEMPTY basehouses and photo truck produced approximately
140 rolls of operational photos in support of the Station's CE program during
‘the reporting period, The Station considers the photo coverage of the
LIMERICK installation as essential tool in following the daily activities of the
personnel of that installation, including known and suspected intelligence
officers, and individuals visiting the . establishment. .

. Selected examples of the LIEMPTY contr ibution to the Station's
CE program and its support of other Station operations are as follows:

operation has been unique, The cutouts provided. professional level

_ countersurveillance during the actual meetings between AMRIBT-1
and Oliver E, FORTSON (ps), passed. letters to the LIERODE insta l-
lation, wrote many letters and placed numerous phone calls in support
of this operation and have actually carried on the daily activity of the
operation, ; :

b. Inthe Soviet area the activities under this project have been
many and varied, Examples of this are: Stake out of a meeting be-
tween a Soviet intelligence officer and LISTEED-1; reporting of LICAL
on the agitation of Aleksandr SIDOROV, Soviet Military Attache and
known intelligence officer, following a Station provocation of him,
LIENTRAP coverage of Lorenzo CA RDENAS Barrajas, a Soviet contact
a stake out of a bowling alley popular with PBPRIME citizens and officia
living in Mexico to determine the extent of a Soviet intelligence officer’
attempts to cultivate these individuals; and LIMITED's radio dispatchi
of the LIEMBRACE team when this team was assigned to surveillance ¢
LIMERICK iargets,

c. Oliver G, SCANTLING greatly aided the Station's operation
to discredit and harass ESLARD-1 when ESLARD-1 returned to Mexicc
from his native country, On one occasion SCANTLING made anonymiot
phone calls to all major wire services informing them ofthe location o
ESLARD-1 who at that time was in hiding under an alias,

_ qd, Inthe Station's continuing attempt to provide greater cover
of the outlying states of Mexico, GERENDE has been assigned to devel
_contacts in Zacatecas and Aguascalientes which can be act ivated into
operational assets in future. GERENDE has already met with some
success in this area, but due to his heavy workload in the operational
role.assigned him in the Station's support mechanism, continued ex-

ploitation of thes? contacts probably will be a slow process,

e, LILYRIC reporting has been of great interest in a matter c
LAURICLE concern, .

f, In the general support of other Station operations, tasks of
the cutouts continue as reported in reference, SCANTLING performs
as alternate cutout to LICASA-1 in a sensitive LAURICLE operation,
The project cutouts service 18 P. O, Box drops used not only for Statir
operations but also in support of Headquarters, JMWAVE, and other
Station requirements, The completion of a new 4.5 meter security
wall at the LIMERICK installation was fully reported on by the LICAL'
basehouse operator,

.. g. Numerous investigations and miscellaneous assignments w
conducted by the project agents; a sampling of these follows: an inve:
tigation of a contact of the Cuban Consul in Merida, a casing of the sil
ESLARD-L had planned to use as a secluded retreat (including picture
support of the DMHULK operation in arranging by telephone the conta:
between DMHULK and a KUBARK staff officer, investigation in
Cuernavaca of the purchaser of the Alfred STERN property located
there, anda report by LIEMPTY-13 of the support of former Mexican
president Lazaro CARDENAS among the troop command officers of ti:
Mexican Army.

The security wall recently erected to the height of 4,5 meters

around the perimeter of the LIMERICK installation has reduced somewhat the |

area of coverage of the LICALLA base. Certa in interior arrangements have

een made, such as raising the floor of the operating room at LICALLA, which

will allow. continued operation of the base, However, if some sort of vegetatioi
grows over the wire strands at the top of the fence, the view of the base will -
he shut off completely and other arrangements for photo coverage of the

- LICALLA area of responsibility will have to be made.

4, EQUIPMENT

No new equipment was purchased during the reporting period
nor is any such purchase presently planned, All assigned equipment tunct iones
normally during this per iod, . ; : :

5, PERSONNEL

No change in personnel assignments, recruitments or termin-
ations was experienced during the reporting period, The performance of all
personnel in the project continued to be completely satisfactory during this
period, The support rendered by SCANTLING and GERENDE to the AMBOD
operation deserves particular mention and their superior performarice in tha’
operation was noted in paragraph 2a above,

; In recognition of his continued good all yound performance the
Station recently requested that GERENDE's contract be amended to provide
for an increase in annual salary from $US 5, 500 to $US 6, 000. This raise.
not only desired, it is considered necessary to offset the continued inflation:
trend of the Mexican economy. ;

 

  

6. ‘TRAINING

As in the previous reporting period, no training other than
continued review of tradecratt principles was conducted during this per iod,
Photographic product continues to be reviewed daily and the action agents a!
instructed as necessary in order to improve or correct their technique in
both the taking and processing of this product.

7, PLANS
Since the Station considers that this project is operating at i

optimum size, it does not plan to expand it at the present time. Efforts wi
continue to refine and better utilize the existing operational mechanism,
