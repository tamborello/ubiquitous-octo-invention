On May 11, 1953, during an interview with JOHN LA ROCCA
in connection with an official matter, ‘the Subject of
the Mafia came up and LA ROCCA advised SA JOHN S. PORTELLA

as follows: - .

He denied current or past existence in the United States

of any organization known as the Black Hand or Mafia.

He said Sicilians who had come to the United States had
congregated in certain communities in the same fashion as

had Irish and other nationality groups, because of similarities
of ‘interests and backgrounds. These communities had-

naturally given rise to social, fraternal and civic groups

and members of such groups as a matter of course assisted
other members who were in ay sort of trouble. The tactics

used in some instances to achieve the ends desired by some |
of these groups were not always according to the letter of the

law, but they were generally more effective. In any group
there are those who refuse to work for a living and sometimes
resort to extorting a livelihood from anyone who could be
frightened or terrorized. In an Italian community these i
few would naturally be referred to as the Black Hand or i
Mafia because of the history of similar activities on the

part of the Mafia in Sicily. by A Manmneri no
