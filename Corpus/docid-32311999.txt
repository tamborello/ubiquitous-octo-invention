ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT

JOHN F. KENNEDY

November 22, 1963, Dallas, Texas
MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING

‘On the night of March 28, 1966, Mrs. Jean Lollis Hill,
9402 Bluff Creek, Dallas, Texas, telephone number EV 1-2271,
telephonically contacted the Dallas Office of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) and requested that she be contacted by a
Special Agent familiar with the assassination investigation. |

On the morning of March 29, 1966, Mrs, Hill advised
that during the past week she has been telephonically contacted
on several occasions by an individual identifying himself as
De Antonio who indicated he and a Mr. Black were preparing an c
educational television documentary concerning the assassination
of President Kennedy and desired to interview her in detail. She
stated that she had not consented to such an interview but on
the evening of March 28, 1966, two individuals identifying them-
selves as De Antonio and Black, appeared at her residence for the
purpose of interviewing her. She stated that she questioned them
as to the exact nature of their visit and being a school teacher,
herself, doubted that they were endeavoring. to compile data for
any edicational television documentary relating to the assassination.

Mrs. Hill stated that she had previously talked to an
individual named Jones Harris, who was also desiring to interview
her for purposes of a book he was writing and that Jones Harris
had indicated to her that De Antonio was one of "Mark Lane's men."

Mrs. Hill advised that she specifically asked De Antonio
and Black if they were connected with Mark Lane and De Antonio
admitted that Mark Lane was "one of their backers." She stated
De Antonio mentioned that some of the backing was coming from
England for his project.
