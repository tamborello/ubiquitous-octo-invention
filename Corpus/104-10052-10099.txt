5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,

; although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project.objectives can never be com-

pletely fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made
important and valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives
specifically and to other Station activities in general. SCANTLING's
production, measured against monetary expenditures, case officer time
and other intengible factors, unquestionably justifies | his continuation
as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY. |

. B. Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relati ion to project _

object ives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK —-

“personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic basé houses. "

Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to this objective. To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute :
to the above objective. This was described in detail in the 1960 Request for
Project Renewal. (HMMA~15979)

2. “To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objeciive,
Among LIENTRAP's regular and extensive photographic assignments, was
the photo stakeout of prominent Mexican Communists (some of whom have...
never been photographed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party

--Headquarters, During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover — -

the recent move of PCM Headquatters (the first information Station had | .
of the move) and to continue photo surveillance at the new site,

3. “Fo provide operational support to Station operations, i.e.’ -
rent hotel rooms and apart ments, and conduct counter-surveillances, *
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other —

extremely vaiuable Sation asset.for such support activities, “GERENDE :
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them,

  

ss

'4,. The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE s control _
and supervision is considered worthwhile and in some cases unique.. The |
Station concludes, therefore,. that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project Joe
should be continued, oo Be af
|

C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in previous project renewals, it can readily be noted that ; |

“-! Project LIEMPTY has provided stipport to many Station operations and in °°
this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related |
Mission Directive, . The project has not produced any Positive intelligence
nor has it been interided that it should do so. The project's sole purpose . \

is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational informati ion :
‘in support of other Station operations, Oo

base has been compromised. :

The Station considers that the project is operating at its optimum 4
‘size and does not plan to expand ir during the coming year. Efforts will —
be continued to refine and better utilize che existing project organizational
arvangements, As in the past, the Station will continue its efforts to
improve the compartmentation and security of the project,

Review of Project LIEMPTY

 

(For the purpose of Project Renewal)

CUR RENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A. Oliver G, “ SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
object ives): .

."To. collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK - ;
personnel and physical facilities!" SCANTLING has continued (see pre-
vious Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-17999, 31 ,
October 1961, HMMA-14093, 13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18 | ae
November 1960) to provide worthwhile information pertaining to this ob- _
-jective, During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be used ex- ; i
tensively to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT and LIENVOY, An ex-
cellent example of this blending of various Station support assets was the
.investigation and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads from both.
LIENVOY and LIFEAT indicated the possibility of launching a successful
technical operation against the residence of a high ranking LIMERICK. _
intelligence officer assigned to Mexico under diplomatic cover, Withthe i
aid of the thorough casing report and neighborhood investigation completed
by SCANTLING, Station KURIOT personnel, supported by other Station
.support assets, were successful in installing a technical device inthe ; ;
target. : ; !

 

SCANTLING continues to be the Station's primary means of keeping
.current records on the residences of the many Soviet personel in Mexico. :
‘City. This is primarily accomplished through SCANTLING's follow up of
_all LIENVOY leads which indicate interest by Soviets in specific quarters. i
(See previous project renewal requests for additional details.) - - +

i

2. "To collect operat ional information pertaining to other targets of
-opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence in-. -
terest operating in Mexico", SCANTLING is very useful for collecti ing: in-
formation on other Station targets:

 
 

‘a, On the basis of. a lead from the » ODACID installation in. ;
Veracruz, the Station (with Headquarters support) mounted an : 4
operat ion to unobtrusively sabotage a large unit of agricultural
machinery (of U.S. origin) which was in transit.to Cuba, To
mount this operation, a precise and detailed casing of the imple-
ment was essential, This SCANTLING was able to accomplish in i
one trip to Veracruz ¥ with results i that contributed subf oO
' the oper vation,

b. SCANTLING provided the Station a detailed investigation
of Harotun ("Harry") KOPOIAN, employee of American Communists
Albert and Margaret MALTZ, which . | determined the residence ~
of KOPOIAN as well as his family status and connections,

~c, In the Satellite area, SCANTLING completed a casing of
an official Yugoslav installation in conjunction with a Projected
Station technical operation,

"3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, “ debriefings, ~ . 7
~ and surveillances," SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both .
directly and indirectly as noted in the following examples: |

a. SCANTLING completed a detailed and secure interview of »
the fiancee of BESMOOTH to determine her connection with the
principals in the MCMAYFOWL case, particularly any connection
with procurement of documents used in the flight behind the Iron

_ Curtain, This assignment was extremely sensitive (SCANTLING.
was not told true reason for interview) and SCANTLING didan. .
admirable job while maintaining his cover for having the interview.. ~

b. SCANTLING was calied on for extensive initial spade work
in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation. SCANTLING © gave his ae
usual competent performance despite the fact that the role assigned
him was unique to his experience.

c. SCANTLING performed one man surveillance of a sensitive an
“Station Soviet double agent which contributed Significayely tothat - |
operation. oo . i:
4

cd. SCANTLING was used extensively during the visit of — a i
GPIDEAL as part of the Station's effort in providing maximum a

’ protection for the GPIDEAL party, = , ee ne

 

‘In additi ion, SCANTLING performed. numerous pretext and .
woighborhood investigations, some of which were highly:sensitive:.

SCA ANTLING @ iso doés most of the local investigations requested by a
ODACID and other ODYOKE components,

 

- 4, In addition to his contributions to the above objectives, SCANTLING
is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the Station, For example,
SCANTLING nandled-LIEMBROIL-2 until the recurn of LIMOTOR -14 in July
1962. SCANTLING is also used to spot and rent safe houses.and.apaxergents
for other Station operations, Nya . i
