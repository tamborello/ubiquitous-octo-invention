On 10/5/63, while the group was lodged at a motel
and visited by the American Military Mission, BUSH, COLLIER and
KAY were interviewed as a group by the mission. HEMMING and.
asseciates were interviewed at a later time by the military,
mission. During the interview HEMMING was abusive, belligerent and
disrespectful and told the military mission that Senator THURMAN
had an interest in this matter. a “(al :

Informant advised that HEMMING and his group were
dressed in an odd assortment of war surplus uniforms, fatigue
suits and boots. HEMMING wore an orange colored flight suit.
HEMMING and his associates were a disgrace to the U.S. and

created a very bad impression. On the other hand, the basic dishonest!

of the Guatemalan Government, coupled with its suspicions and its

propensity te a Class B movie, caused a great amount of
confusion, & ws

Informant claims that the Guatemalan Government is as
dishonest, unscrupulous, and deceitful as is GERALD PATRICK
HEMMING and his associates, and the encounter between the Guatemalan
Government and HEMMING, et al, resulted in the Guatemalan
Government being out-deceived by HEMMING's lies and insinuations
resulting in. the Guatemalan Government's deporting HEMMING and
his grou. (3 5H)

Informant feels that any responsible government would
have immediately recognized HEMMING as nothing more than an
adventurer, Informant was highly complimentary concerning the

courtesy, dignity and restraint shown by the American Militar x
Mission during the interview of HEMMING and his group. lus |
For the information of the Bureau, details of this Y
matter are set forth in a form suitable for dissemination in \

the occupants of the airplane were detained and flown to
Guatemala City in a Guatemalan Air Force C-47 airplane. On
arrival in Guatemala City, they were taken to the Air Force
Headquarters and there detained. After a time, a group of
Guatemalan Air Force pilots came to the headquarters and
iavited the search party to the officers’ club for a party.

At the officers’ club, the search party was questioned very
thoroughly by the Guatemalan pilote, who spoke English and
¥veadily admitted they were representing the Guatemalan
Intelligence Service. During this period, HEMMING, WILSON

and HERNANDEZ got drunk and furnished the Guetemalan pilots
with much untrue information. HEMMING talked at great length
against U.S. Government officials, U.S. Government policy, and
the corruption and ineptness of the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency. HEMMING talked so unfavorably about the U.S. Government
that the Guatemalan officers started suspecting him of being an
agent of the Communist Cuban Government. The behavior of
HEMMING, WILSON and HERNANDEZ was @ source of great embarrassment
to the others in the search party. & {tu

The search party was then lodged that evening at
the Motel Plaza, Guatemala City, and although there were
no armed guards, they were under surveillance and restricted
te the motel. & Gx) /
