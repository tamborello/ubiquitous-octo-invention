ALEX had departed from the hotel on January 25, 1961
unexpectedly and without giving prior notice to. the hotel and. removed all

also asked for maps of Austria and stated that he would travel to

Innsbruck and Kitzbuehel, Austria, and would return the car on Sunday,

any visitors at that hotel, nor was he observed in any conversation other: oo
than with hotel personnel, :

. It could not be established where ALEX went after leaving
. Munich on January 25, 1961 until he checked in at the Bayerischer Hof
