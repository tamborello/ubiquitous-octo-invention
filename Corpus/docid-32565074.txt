appearing at INS hearing.

PH 665-C-TE has advised BUFALINO stated to Informant that
WASSERMAN wants to subpoena records of Federal Agencies including
FBI into hearing, and will do anything to accomplish this.

FBI has not been mentioned in press in connection with
WASSERMAN's charges, Article appearing in Philadelphia Inquirer
Friday morning, 4/10/64, states as follows: "Attorney for
RUSSELL BUFALINO, 60, charged Thursday at deportation proceedings
that the Federal Government was monitoring telephone calls and
mail of his client, and called upon the agencies 'to disclaim
this contention or acknowledge it'".

Since WASSERMAN's charge was emphatically refuted in
official records of hearing, and since FBI not specifically mentioned
in press in article reporting instant hearing, it is felt best
interest of Bureau has been served, and no further action is
recommended,

Hearing will be closely followed and Bureau advised of
any pertinent developments.
