where this happened,’

Laurel, Mississippi
June 26, 1964.

Informant advised that during the regular meeting of The White
Knights of the Ku Klx Klan of Mississippi (WKKKOM) (The Boguehoma
Hunting and Rifle Club) on Tuésday 6/23/6), the situation regarding
CLINTON CLARENCE COLLINS, SR., was discussed. It was reported that he
had been riding around Laurel, Mississippi with two white women in the
car with him. Some of the members were rather "hot" about this and it
was indicated that something might take place if he did not cease this
activitye

It was reported by DON HENSHAW that he had observed several whites
and negros dancing at the 01d Negro American Legion Club just off
Highway #59 ut the Hast side of Laurel. It was reported(b@aleved by as
HENSHAW) that recently the Sheriff or one of his deputies rode by the - J
American Legion Club and the person stopped dancing andwent in the back

. room, when he left. they came back and started the dance agains Some .

member of the WKKKOM claims to have H&X "peeped" in the window at this
club but did not see anything since the lights were turned outs .

He states (FNU) GRAHAM, who lives on the lower Myrick Road, near i
Laurel and CECIL SESSUMS, Preacher from Shady Grove, Mississi ppi had an
some project recently and several negros were reported to have run :
through the woods, when frieghtened. Informant does not know when or !

-. Informant advised that there is very little discussion about the
various projects prior to the time they are carried out. This is due

to no one except the Division leader and LAWRENCE BYRD, acting project
chairman, knowing about it. The Division Leader pickes his men then’
gives them the project and it is up to them to carry it out. The results
of the projects are discussed at the next meeting after carried oute

   
    

* Informant rode to a meeting with B. PF. HINTON, EG, recently and HINTON
talked about "leaks" in the organization. He thinks there are about two
and maybe more. He did not identify any of the suspected leakso

He feels that the recent incident where HERBSTON STRINGER and the other
man were "sworn out" was due to a misunderstanding between STRINGER and
ED WADSWORTH, Police from Ellisville, Misse. WADSWORTH was supposed to
attend an initiation but missed the group and felt that STRINGER had
crossed him. This was straightened out and the two men were taken back.

into the #XYNX Klan on 6/23/61. (They were sworn out by LAWRENCE BYRD)
