veapon, motor, ete. ia most airesoult for hin. Oa certain test problems, ‘of thie
type, he froze completely, and deteriorated to to aimless movements. His memory -
of numbers and recall of designs which he was required to drav were poor com-.
pared to his other abilities. However, he appears capable of relating 8 clear,
logical sequence of events.

All 4n all, this individual does not heve mech leatership potential in terns
of experience, self-confidence and drive; he needa strong guidance. He feels he
must.do acmething and is pushing himself to volunteer provided he can get re-
ascurence that his job is part of a bigger plan. Although he is sincere and
basically a bright pereon, his performance is apt to vary a good deal and at
times become confused and almost immobile.
