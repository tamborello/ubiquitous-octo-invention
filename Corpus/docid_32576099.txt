MORRISON, several other gamblers, and with JOSEPH MOSHER.
HARTNETT said the IRS Agent had used the alias of BILL SEAMAN
and became acquainted with MOSHER as a fellow bettor. HARTNETT
advised that SEAMAN had utilized an old car, participated in

the raids, was observed by several of the arrested gamblers at
IRS Headquarters during booking and arraignment procedures, and
could very possibly have been recognized as. the undercover Agent
at this time.

On June 22, 1964, Chief of Police JOHN TUFFEY, Albany,
adviséd JOSEPH MOSHER had been known to him for years as a long-
time resident of the Greater Albany area, except for a short
period when he resided in New York City. Chief TUFFEY described

courage to commit-a murder. Chief TUFFEY described PERRONE as
a "blow-hard with political connections in Albany". TUFFEY said
PERRONE "could ‘not even fix a parking ticket". Chief TUFFEY
further advised no information was brought to his attention con-
cerning the Club 21 being up for-sale, indicating that this is
most unlikely, as if such was the case, he would have heard of
it, .

information from the NYSP, a check of the Albany Telephone
Directories reflected that there is a Seaman Real Estate
Agency. in Albay which is operated by a MAURICE SEAMAN.

On June 19, 1964, AL T-6 was contacted under cover
of a routine contact, It should be noted that at no time

during this contact with-him was any mention made to him of
the information heretofore set forth. concerning the alleged
meeting of June 14, 1964. During this contact with him, as on
every contact with him, he was. asked if FALCONE, MANCUSO or
SAM.GRIO had been in contact with him or if he had seen them.
He stated that they have not been in contact with him and that
he had not seen them.for at least two months. At this time,
informant was queried about any gambling interests that FALCONE,
MANCUSO and GRIO might have in the Saratoga Springs, New York,
area. He stated that back in the.1940's, when he operated the
Brook.Club in Saratoga, MANCUSO, FALCONE and several others whom
informant could not recall had.attempted to "muscle in" on DOC
FARONE's gambling interests in Saratoga Springs and had been
literally thrown out of Saratoga by FARONE. Informant further
volunteered that FARONE detests MANCUSO and probably would have
nothing to do with MANCUSO, therefore, would not become involved
with him in gambling. It should be noted that informant advised
that DOC FARONE was a very good friend of his, stating that
FARONE backed him financially when informant operated a restau-
rant and bar equipment supply business in Albany, New York.

During the.contact with informant, he was also asked
what the feeling around town was as.a result of the IRS gambl-
ing raids. He said it was common knowledge around Albany that
an elderly man driving an old car was believed responsible by
loéal gamblers. for furnishing information to IRS that led to
their arrest. He said he had learned this from JOSEPH MOSHER,

an employee at the State Campus Site, who resides at 35 Holmes ...

Court and is employed by the Basic Construction Company as a
truck driver, that 'SCOTCHY'' MORRISON was the source of this

information, and it was indicated by MORRISON that the local

gamblers are out to "rough up" this elderly man. He knows
nothing about this elderly man and could furnish no information
concerning his identity. The above information was volunteered

and at no time had Agents mentioned MOSHER's name nor the alleged

tive to an appeal of SAM FARRAR on a bookmaking conviction in

It should be noted DAN O'CONNELL is well-known and
best described as the political boxx of Albany County and
CHARLIE RYAN is alleged to be one of his chief lieutenants. of

From all information to date, it now appears

MAGADDINO family, which is best illustrated by information
furnished by AL T+4 on April 22, 1964.

Set forth elsewhere in this report is information
furnished by AL T-4 concerning a meeting apparently held
with STEVE MAGADDINO, SAM FARAR and ROSARIO MANCUSO pertain-.

report, this was determined through information previously
furnished by AL T-4, ALT-5, AL T-7, AL T-8, AL T-10, AL T-11
and AL T-15.

, As indicated under. MANCUSO's caption, this business
is no longer being run by FARRAR and MANCUSO due to a falling
out which they had with the Manager, NORMAN JOHNSON. AS a
result of this trouble with JOHNSON, MANCUSO and FARRAR are
now operating amaw siding company called Aluminum Specialties
of America, which is located on North Main Street, Syracuse,
