very concerned over the a sassination of President KENNEDY
and the involvement of OSWALD, who was connected with the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee .(FPCC). Although she did not
indicate which organism of the _ PCM had reached this decision,
it is to be noted that MORA was a member of the so-called —
Leadership Branch of the PCM. She stated that the PCM had
decided that there were only four Americans in Mexico who
might possibly be involved in FPCC operations as far as

the Mexican police might know: ASA ZATZ (Bufile 105-16890),
CHARLES SMALL, and the informants.

As the Bureau is aware, e informants came to the
attention of the Mexican authorities when HELEN LEVI TRAVIS
(Bufile 100-336032), who was admittedly a member of the FPCC,
was arrested and deported in November, 1962. At that time,
the Mexican police found the informants! home address and

telephone number in TRAVIS' motel room and it was necessary
for the informants to go into hid until the Mexican police
gave up efforts to interview them (1)

On 11/23/63, MORA advised the informants that. if
any action was taken against them by the Mexican police,
they should immediately get in touch with JUAN MANUEL

_ GUTIERREZ, the Mexico City attorney whom the informants had
previously been instructed to contact in case they were
arrested for political reasons (Kf wu)

Under the above circumstances, therefore, any
request of the Mexican police to interview SMALL on the basis
of his relations with members of FPCC would focys the
attention of those authorities on{MEx-18 and MEX-19,Jas well EC 4]
as on SMALL, with the possibility that the Mexican police,
who, as pointed out. above, are difficult_to control, might
also take action against the informants

’ Consideration has also been given to calling SMALL,
who is an American citizen, into the Embassy for interview.
It is not felt, however, that such action would be advisable
since any interrogation by Embassy personnel, including this

office, d necessarily have to be predicated on informa-
tion from MEX-18 and MEX-1934} ich would jeopardize the EW}
informants the same as if e by the Mexican police (59

The informants have also advised that SMALL o

a heart condition, claims to have suffered a slight heart

attack while in United States in September, 1963, and is
in poor health. ormation received from CIA, Mexico, clas-
sified "SECRET" not to be disseminated outside the Bureau,

also confirms SMALL's reported heart condition and his
frequent_claims that he has to be very careful not to aggra-

vate it. } An aggressive interview of SMALL by either the cu )

Mexic lice or American personnel might either pakcips te
another heart attack or cause the subject to claim anoth such
attack and accuse the Bureau of being responsible for it

In addition to the above factors, the Mexico City
office has no information to show that such an interview, :
either by the Mexican police or the American officers would |
be productive. Available sources have given no indication \
that SMALL actually ever knew or saw OSWALD. His claim that
he must have known OSWALD at some time and. t he t
have met OSWALD in Mexico was, according to MEX-18 and MEX-19
based on the fact that many American communiSts visiting _
Mexico go to SMALL's store and that he assists them in con-
nection with their problems while visiting Mexico City ,

SMALL, however, has given no indication that he
recognized OSWALD from the newspaper pictures printed in
Mexico City or recognized his name as being one of the 3 «>

, visitors at his store. The informants have reported that

f following the assassination of President KENNEDY and the

‘pn public identification of OSWALD's- leftist. connections with .

the FPCC and his former residence in the Soviet Union, the

f; HN American communists in Mexico were extremely fearful, expect-
7 ‘Sng police harrassment of all leftists. They considered
SMALL's concern-over the possibility that OSWALD might have
. visited his store to be part of the general concern of all
| American communists here after'reading that OSWALD had been
in Mexico. No information has since been developed to the

contrary. .

 

In light of the above, the Mexico City Office does
not believe that an interview of SMALL should be undertaken
by either Mexican or American officials. au :
