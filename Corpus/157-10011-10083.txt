A Well, let's see. I would say that was probably around

1965 because Fitzgerald then became Chief, W.H., and then
later DDP.
Q Now, tit.Harvey ~~ do you recall what position Mr.

Harvey held after he left Task Force W?

 

A Yes. He was { } :

Q And is he still with the Agency?

A Oh, no. He retired a long time ago.

Q Do you know where he lives at the present time?
A Frankly, I don't. I have an idea where he lives.

He went to work for a friend of mine who had a law firm.

 

Harvey is a lawyer.
Q Indianapolis area?
A Yes, some place around there. It is in the midwest,
Indiana.
Q What was the role that was assigned to Task Force
Ww?
A It was the overall Cuban operations.
Q Did the Miami -- when was the Miami Station estab-
lished?
A Well, I think they had a forward operatio~s base down

there about 1960 which was small,

 

Q This was, then, orior to the Bay of Pigs?
A Oh, yes. 5

A Right, except that at the present time the Station

has no Cuban operations.

Q I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-

A At the Station? Let's see. (rent down

there in 1972. It was during fiscal year '72. I think it was

Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing-

called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And

 

 

Y Fitzgerald took over, it became Special Activities Staff.
; It wasn't attached to anytning except -- it reperted to the

Deputy Director, Plans.

And that was Mr. Karamessines?

Yes.

not immediately. I think sometime around --

in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in

something like that, 1961.

And that subsequently became the Special Activities
