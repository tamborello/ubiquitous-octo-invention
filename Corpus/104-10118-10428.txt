COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Although this employee is a fine intelligence officer and has worked
very hard for the Chief of Station, Mexico City, I consider the reting
of Outstanding in e11 specific duties end for over-all performence to be
excessively high. Reporting on the activities she supervises hes been
as good eas that from other Mexico City operations but is still not up
to DDP standards. While most, .oivthe projects she is concerned with are
hendled with proper cost c cere, ‘et least one of them, the LITEMPO
Project,is not. The Seente Wes paid too mech and their activities are
not adequately reported. This hasbeen called to the station's ettention.

Miss Goodpasture has been on sick leave since July 1972 awaiting
medical retiremant in October 1973. She is a charter member of the Agency,
having entered on duty from OSS and its succe organizations. Her
career is highly distinguished by virtu aaeyatently strong to out-
standing performance, all of which Ly ote ented.

. In addition to several s : skassignments, Miss Goodpasture
served in support of the su » up against the,communist government
in Guatemala in 1954 and comi\eted tours of duty in Monterrey and
Mexico City. Undoubtedly, the high point of er_caréer otcurred during
her service in Maxico City from 1957 through Gs79) where she served as a
"trouble-shooting" case officer for the ougit C379) Winfield Scott
(deceased), who was then the Chief of Station. Mr. Scott, a stern task-
‘master, described Miss Goodpasture over these years as “intelligent, hard
working, conscientious, versatile, valuable and unquestionably one of the
most competent SI/CE officers he ever had the privilege of working with."

-Miss Goodpasture's fitness reports were totally consistent with this
appraisal, and were characterized by outstanding ratings. In her final
assignment prior to acute medical problems, she worked for the CI Staff

(October 1970-October 1971), earning the following remarks from her

supervisor: "...1 venture to rate her overall performance, thirty years
of it, as Outstanding. Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which

By virtue es eae duty which over a

period of several yea consistently long hours,
