Re San. Diego airtel dated 11/7/58 captioned
“Top. Hoodlum Program = AR, Weekly Summary," wherein informa-
tion was. set forth regarding one Maurice Mickey Mandel, was.,
who had recently been discharged from the Federal Penitentiary
at Leavenworth, Kansas. According to information furnished
by SD 968-C Mandel. named Benny Bennion (phonetic), Las Vegas,
as owing him a favor and described him as a person. who would
bank roll-him if he needed it. It is considered most
likely that Mandel was referring to Top Hoodlum Lester Benjamin
: Binion. ‘In view of efforts: being made. to cultivate Binion
as a Bureau informant, Salt Lake City should consider
questioning him during next regular contact regarding his
connections with Mandel. Any Significant information should
be. promptly furnished to the Bureau with copies for the
San Francisco and San. Diego offices.

 

 

 

 

For the information of the Salt Lake City Office,

Mandel approached CI to rob bank in area and requested CI to
obtain firearms. He told CE he had appointment to meet 2

fellow prisoners. from Leavenworth in San Francisco in —

January, 1959..' Mandel was subsequently identified as a

Conditional Release Violator Fugitive and was arrested in
Oakland, California, by Agents of the San Francisco Office
on November 5, 1958. Sufficient discretion must be employ
in the approach to Binion in this matter so as. not to
compromise ;the original informant.
