PROPOSED RESPONSE TO MR. BLAKEY FROM MR. KESTER

Dear Mr. Blakey:

This letter is in reply to your letter of 15 November 1978 to Secretary
Brown, requesting certain information relating to the investigation of the
assassination of President Kennedy.

Cognizant elements of the Department of Defense have made a thorough and
detailed search in an attempt to find records which might relate to the matters
as’ recently discussed between you and Ms. Miller of my office.

The search efforts included discussions with individuals familiar with
relevant operational procedures existing during the 1963 time frame, a review
of records of stored files that might be applicable to your inquiry, and a
physical review of specific records in warehouse storage (recognizing that
most records from this period no longer exist).

The search efforts described above revealed no information relevant
to your request.

Sincerely,

JOHN G. KESTER

M/R: On 8 November, Mr. Robert G.. Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff Director

for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, posed a number of questions to
NSA regarding a former Air Force enlisted man's allegation that he had intercepted ©
information linking an assassination plot against President Kennedy with a figure
in organized crime. Mr. Blakey subsequently submitted a written request (dated

15 November) to support his verbal one. :

“In essense, the questions probed NSA's ability to quickly and thoroughly
probe for records from the Air Force site in Kirknewton, Scotland (USA-55,
now closed), for information relating to the allegation.

i
’

G809 and N33 personnel reviewed both a listing of data and boxed records
from USA-55, but their efforts failed to reveal evidence of the alleged incident.
The actual traffic from this period was minimal and no other records are extant.

The Director has approved.
