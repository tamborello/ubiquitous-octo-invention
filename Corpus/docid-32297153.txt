Re: MIRR ;

reported that on the same day, he observed a Cuban
entering the front office of a sugar company at Clewiston.
IGLESI immediately thereafter contacted his cousin, Sa
ALBER' MIREZ, who is also his ranch manager, who was Lle_
at th ugar company office, and ascertained that the
individual mentioned above had identified himself to
RAMIREZ as "MIMO." RAMIREZ told IGLESIAS that "MIMO"

\ stated he was in Clewiston on behalf of the MIRR, "MIMO"

 

requested RAMIREZ to contribute some dynamite to the MIRR,
"MIMO" also stated that he was trying to obtain permission
to use a ranch to experiment with some new weapons which
the MIRR had developed.

IGLESIAS, on May 12, 1965, identified a photograph
of GERVELIO GUTIERREZ CONCEPCION as being identical to
"MIMO." (Previous investigation has reflected that
GUTIERREZ is the so-called “bomb expert" of the MIRR,)

 

On April 21, 1965, MM T-2 advised that several
days previously, BOSCH stated it was necessary to keep
alive among the Cubans in exile the idea that Cuban liberation
is essential, and that financial contributions had to be
obtained in whatever way it was possible to do so, whether
by robbing a bank, or killing someone, if necessary, BOSCH
claimed there are many wealthy people in the Miami area
who are not at all concerned about Cuba. He labeled them
as traitors.

BOSCH also claimed that his organization is planning
a big attack on Cuba, and that instead of dropping bombs on
sugar cane fields, the bombs would be dropped on oil -
refineries. BOSCH claimed that his organization has acquired
some good equipment, and that they have a supply of forty-
eight bombs and several cannons. He did net describe either
the bombs or the cannons in greater detail, '

On April 19, 1965, MM T-3 reported that MARCELINO GARCIA
of the MIRR disclosed that the MIRR has been trying to find a —
place outside the United States from which the MIRR can operate,
GARCIA stated that BOSCH is afraid of the United States Government
