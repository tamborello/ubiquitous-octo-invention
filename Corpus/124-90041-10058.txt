MM 105-9002 ereREn

On July 21, 1964, STANLEY SCHACHTER, U.S.
Customs, Miami, advised he possessed no information
concerning OSAC and he did not know of any boats which
JUAN MESA might have an interest in.

On July 21, 1964, Captain JOHN LOWRY, Merrill-
Stevens Drydock Company, 1270 N.W. 11th Street, Miami,
Florida, advised he is well acquainted with all the
vessels given berth in Merrill-Stevens facilities in
Miami, but had no knowledge of a boat fitting the des-
cription of 75 to 80' which was berthed at 17th
Avenue and the Miami River, according to information
received from MM T-1 of this report. Captain LOWRY
also advised he was not familiar with the name JUAN
MESA.

On July 22, 1964, MM T-1 said he believed
OSAC may be utilizing MARCELINO GARCIA of MIRR to ob-
tain a bomb or torpedo. He said GARCIA is secretive
but apparently has contact with someone, Cuban or
American, in the Carolinas whereby he may be able to
ebtain a bomb or torpedo.

MM T-1. was advised that on July 20, 1964, JUAN
MESA and "TONY' ARANGO were interviewed at approximately
9:00 AM and 3:00 PM, respectively. MM T-1 said he
_ planned to tell MESA he was visited by an FBI Agent,
name unknown, on July 20, 1964, and was worried because
of questions about OSAC, although revealing nothing to

Agent. This arrangement is believed desirable for pro-
tection of MM T-1l.

- At 4:45 PM on July 20, 1964, RAY DuBOIS,
CIA, Miami, called the Miami Office and asked to speak
to SA JAMES J. O' CONNOR, This call occurred approxi-
mately 10 minutes after SA.O'CONNOR had talked with

$)[Attorney JIM McDONALD]by telephone at Homestead,

Florida. Mr. DuBOIS was telephonically contacted on
the evening of July 20, 1964 by SA O'CONNOR, at which
time he advised CIA has an operational interest in
NELSON IGLESIAS, and in the Marine Engineering and
Training Corporation. (oA

It was pointed out to Mr. DuBOIS that IGLESIAS
is evidently involved in OSAC. Mr. DuBOIS advised he
had no knowledge of such affiliation by IGLESIAS but
that it would not be the first time a party of CIA in-
terest became involved in some side operation, ending
up on the ma (uy resulting in charges against

CIA. BQ (u

Mr. DuBOIS was requested to advise if possibly
the "controlled" actions of IGLESIAS might, for publicity
purposes, be attributed in the past to OSAC. - It was
pointed out to Mr, DuBOIS that according to information.
received in the investigation of OSAC, that some. American
attorneys are reportedly involved. Mr. DuBOIS stated
he would check into the matter and further advise. PUG

On July 13, 1964, MM T-1 accompanied Agent: _ |
in an attempt to locate the home where the OSAC meet- |
ing of July 8, 1964 occurred. MM T-1 pointed out the
house, located at the southwest corner of Douglas
Road and Stewart Avenue, in Coconut Grove, Miami, MM Tel .
stated he believed this was fa CIA "safe house because(S)
no one seemed to live there,~although it was furnished
and contained several telephones. \

Also on July 13, 1964, MM T-1 pointed out ~ {
_ the residence at 743 Sistina, Coral Gables, Florida, as
the home at which he believed one of the American
attorneys was dropped off after attending the meeting
at the house in Coconut ‘Grove.

“it is to be noted that the Miami file on
CASADO reflects he has a close friend named ARGELIO ;

“with respect to the identity JUAN. MESA, it
appears he is identical to sualiues DRIGUEZ, who as
of June, 1963, resided at 1868 i3th Street, Miami,
Florida, and who was.reported to the Miami Office at at |
that time to be operating a short wave radio station. at

 

| that address. [Contact was made on July 16, 1963 with
] of CIA, Miami, at which time he advised
that JUAN MESA RODRIGUEZ was of operational interest to

his agency; was residing at 1868 S.W. 13th Street with
his family, and was out of the country as of July 16,
1963, and not expected to return until July 24, 1963.

' This information is set forth in Miami file 105- “7969 Tai) (u)

Efforts to locate a file on JUAN MESA in the

files of U.S. INS, Miami, have thus far met with negative
results. MESA, as described by MM T-1, is a man in his

early 40s, who had a radio busfness in Cuba and who
speaks Spanish and English fluently.

that telephone #444-8751 had been listed to JUAN Ms
RODRIGUEZ at 1868 S.W. 13th Street, Miami. . This phone
was disconnected on June 6, 1964 and a new telephone,
#238-6863, listed to RODRIGUEZ at 9910 Pan American
Drive, Perrine, Florida. Mrs. ANDREW stated RODRIGUEZ
had indicated his employment as "U.S8%-Government Public ~
Relations" and a reference as MAURICE f SHORAGO, telephone
HI 8-8320. : o

The above was furnished to SA LEMAN L,
STAFFORD, Jr. :

It is to be noted that MM T-1 of this report
is an officer in the anti-CASTRO organization, Frank
Pais Revolutionary Movement (FPRM). He has advised
that in addition to being personally acquainted with
JUAN MESA, MESA has sought to include him in the acti-
vities of OSAC, because the FPRM has considerable Cuban
exile man power, which MM T-1 states have various skills
which might be utilized by OSAC. One such person is
eva "PEPEIUNCO, whom MM T=1 states is proficient in setting
up. remote control apparatus.

_MM T-l has. stated he has the impression that
considerable financial support is being received by
OSAC from American citizens, and he is not clear as. to ~~
the motivation. He stated that he also has the im- ;
pression that the operations of OSAC are being conducted
through liaison with CIA, [He stated he is aware that
JUAN MESA in the past has worked closely with CIAL 16+: Ms)
