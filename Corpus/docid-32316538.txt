On Page 51 of the "New York Times" of May 25, 1963,
an article concerning the killing of WALTER GLOCKNER was
carried and mentioned that in June, 1961, ANTHONY CASTELLITO,
Secretary-Treasurer of Local 560, International Brotherhood
of Teamsters, had disappeared and is presumed dead. "Observers
believed that his popularity had posed a threat to the
PROVENZANO leadership."

Motive for SAL BRIGUGLIO

It is to be noted on July 3, 1964, NY T-1 advised
that he heard from RICHIE BARRETT, who was incarcerated at
the New Jersey State Prison, Trenton, New Jersey, that
KONIGSBERG murdered "Three Fingers" CASTILLANO, stated
CASTILLANO (undoubtedly reference to CASTELLITO) was the
forner President of Local 560, International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, in New Jersey. KONIGSBERG was assisted in this
murder by a SALLY BORGIO (phonetic) (undoubtedly SALVATORE
BRIGUGLIO) who became a business agent for Local 560 right
after the murder and as payment for his part in the murder.

On June 22, 1965, HAROLD KONIGSBERG advised that, as
part of the deal for killing CASTELLITO, ANTHONY PROVENZANO
(TONY PRO) promised SAL BRIGUGLIO a business agent job.

According to the "Local 560 Teamster,'' Volume 2,
Number 5, May, 1963, which 1s published by Local Union 56,
Tnternational Brotherhood of Teamsters, 707 Summit Avenue,
Union City, New Jersey, one of the business agents listed was
SAL BRIGUGLIO,.

Location of Murder Site
KONIGSBERG, on June 10, 1965, stated, "When they got

him (CASTELLITO) to a farm in upstate New York, CASTELLITO was
killed.
