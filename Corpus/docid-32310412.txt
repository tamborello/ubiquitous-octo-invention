| that he has known e applicant—since— 1962-7~dnd_regards
him as:a soldier of fortune and an adventurer who has |
earned a reputation for his wild flights of fantasy
and his occasional uncouthness. He stated that the
character of the applicant is highly questionable and
he commonly tells people things which he knows are
not the truth. He stated that the applicant is a
very impressive person physically, being approximately
6'5" tall and well proportioned. He is quite intelli-
gent, well read, and well versed in military infor-

j mation. However, BROWN stated that because of the
many times he has seen the applicant stretch the truth,
he would hesitate to.recommend him, for any position
where the applicant's personal reports of a situation
would have to be accepted. He stated that in his opinion
the applicant could be a very valuable man if his
trustworthiness and truthfulness could be depended upon,
