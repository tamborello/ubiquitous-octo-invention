NY 92-2568

Upon the completion of the telephone call,

two unknown individuals entered NOONAN's office, The

- 4nformant advised one was BERNIE (LNU) and the other
one,whose name the informant could not furnish, was
described by the informant as an individual living in
Yonkers, NY, who is suffering from high blood pressure : i
which consequently forced him to seek employment requiring |
little exertion and who worked with MICKEY MC LOUGHLIN (ph) ~ ;
some 12 or 13 years ago on Plier 58. The two unknown
subjects: requested NOONAN'S assistance in obtaining a job
for the unknown subject with high plood pressure. NOONAN
first remarked that Local 807 (IBT) is no good and, therefore,
he will try Local 707 (IBT). NOONAN called NICK (LNU) at ©

: Local 707, IBT, and. requested NICK's assistance in obtaining

! : a position for the unknown individual. Upon completion

of the call, NOONAN advised that NICK 1s going to call back

and that meanwhile the two unknown individuals should :

i remain in NOONAN's office. -
;

 

. /BERNIE (LNU) asked NOONAN “how's the big fellow,
_' EDDIE." NOONAN's answer is inaudible. It is noted that
NY 1716-c has advised.in the past that the term "big
fellow" .is used among NOONAN's associates when referring
i a to EDDIE MC GRATH. BERNIE (LNU) then remarked "MURPHY 1s
\ in Candlewood (?)" ahd "what do you think of SONNY
CAMPBELL?" There:follows a general discussion and
poy . "eonversation between the two unknown subjects and NOONAN
‘pegarding CAMPBELL's arrest and the fact that CAMPBELL is
out on bail, ‘The unknown individual from Yonkers remarked .
that he saw CAMPBELL's sister, GRACIE, the day before :
yesterday (5/5/63) and NOONAN remarked he never thought
: that "they" would let him out on bail. NOONAN discussed
. CAMPBELL's forthcoming trial and stated the best that
_ CAMPBELL could hope for is a hung jury. NOONAN remarked
that there are a number of individuals involved in this
H matter and some are doing five years, some are doing seven
; and a half. years, and some are-doing 15 years and "you can
bet your life that none of those doing 15 years are | ; i
snitching." NOONAN is of the opinion that CAMPBELL is |
in serious trouble and again reiterated that the best :
CAMPBELL can hope for is a disagreement among the jurors.
