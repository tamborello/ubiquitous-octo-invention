As/a result of information developed by Rolling, ‘the FBI
was: the first Federal investigative agency to learn that Marcello.
had obtained a fraudulent Guatemalan birth certificate in 1957.

In addition ‘to identifying the individual who actually obtained :
these false papers, Rolling also named the Guatemalan attorney and Guater,
malan Government officials who assisted in this matter. This

information was immediately disseminated to INS by us for assistance
Mis that agency since it had been attempting to deport Marcello since
1953. |

; For the past three years, Rolling, who has been employed
as a handbook andi barroom operator in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana,
and is closely associated with several New Orleans top hoodluns,
including Marcello, has furnished considerable information concerning
underworld activity in this area, including detailed information with
respect ‘to. the operation of the Nola Printing Co., Jefferson Parish.
The Nola ‘printing™Co., which is owned and operated by Marcello and , f
some of ‘his associates, furnishes horse race information throughout”

the southeastern United States. REC-7 G 2— Zz q / 3 __ h vel |
