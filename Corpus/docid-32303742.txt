-

NY 3864-c-TE advised SA BENJAMIN F, GRAVES on
4/17/63, that he did not know the subject.

Review of references on the subject's name and
variations, as well as review of file of persons believed to
be associates of the subject, failed to reflect any additional
information regarding his identity or membership in any organized
criminal element.

Inasmuch as the NYO is unable to place the subject in
"La Causa Nostra" or any organized criminal element, and also is
unable to fully identify him, this case is being closed by the
NYO, UACB. :

In the event information is developed through other
investigations which fully identifies TARTAGLIA, this case will
be re-opened in the NYO and investigation will be conducted in
accordance with the Criminal Intelligence Program.
