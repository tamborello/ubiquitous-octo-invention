DAVID G. MARWELL

Biographical Information

SF uly 1, 1994, the Berlin Document Center (BDC) was wansferred to the German
Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv) marking the end of nearly 48 years of American control
of this unique organization. With an estimated 25 million Nazi-era personnel-related files,
the BDC was once a crucial source of evidence for the Nuremberg Trials and is today an
incalculably important source for the study of the Third Reich. The transfer also marked
the end of David Marwell’s tenure as Director of the BDC.

A well-trained scholar with a PH.D. in History, Marwell came to Berlin in 1988 from
the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), U.S. Department of Justice where he held the
position of Chief of Investigative Research. At OSI, he was involved in researching and
preparing cases against accused Nazi war criminals residing in the United States. In
addition, he was selected to participate in the Klaus Barbie Investigation (1983) and played

‘a major role in the Josef Mengele investigation (1985), both of which received
international attention.

In connection with the Joseph Mengele and Kiaus Barbie investigations, Marwell was
in charge of assembling all relevant documentary evidence relating to any possible
connection between these individuals and U.S. institutions or personnel. The
investigations were two of the most unusual ever undertaken and through them he gained
siginificant experiences in the identifying and locating documentary resources. The former
Director of OSI, Allan A. Ryan, Jr., in his book Quier Neighbors: Prosecuting Nazi War
Criminals in America, described Marwell as “an experienced and careful historian who
could find documents in archives when no one else could." ;

When Marwell arrived at the Document Center, the institution had been rocked bya
scandal involving a significant theft.of documents. The resulting focus on the €enter
revealed that it had been neglected in many areas for many years and suffered from an
outi#8d8d administrative structure, a disaffected and undertrained staff and a lack of
professional. guidance. It was Marwell’s job to bring the Center up to standard and prepare
it for turnover to the German government.

The challenges facing Marwell were not only to manage a complex institution (with
an annual budget of eight million deutschmarks) and repair past deficiencies, but also to
define a future for an institution in transition. He prepared a “five year plan" for the BDC
that set five goals, developed a corresponding program to meet each goal, and designed a ~
system to monitor the progress. In achieving all of the goals, Marwell:

¢ Introduced computer technology (there was nota single computer at the

BDC when he arrived) and developed a sophisticated, integrated information

_._Tetrieval system that has been described as a model for archive
= “Sadministration;

¢ Created a fully professional document conservation and restoration program;
¢ Developed a staff (50 Germans and 20+ Americans) that is better trained and

far more responsible, flexible and creative than it had been;

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director. of Central Intelligence

VIA: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence
Executive Director
Director, Center for the Study of
Intelligence

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: Request of JFK Assassination Records
Review Board for Courtesy Visit with DCI

1. Action Requested: Paragraph 4 below contains a
recommendation for your approval. The Chairman of the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), John Tunheim, has
requested that you meet with him and the other four Board :
members at Headquarters Building some time in the next several
months. He asks that the meeting be arranged to coincide with
one of their monthly sessions, which are held in Washington.
(The schedule of their meetings is attached.) The Board's
Executive Director, David Marwell, would also participate.

2. Background: Mr. Tunheim, recently appointed a
federal judge in Minnesota, would like to provide you with
a brief description of the Board’s purpose and activities.
The Board has paid similar visits to the FBI, where they _
met with Director Freeh, and to NSA and the Secret Service.
The @REB members were appointed by President Clinton in 1993
as required by statute. Their principal responsibility is to
ensure public disclosure of government records related to the
assassination of President Kennedy. The statute grants the
Board full access to all documents that are related to either
the assassination or past investigations into the assassina-
tion.

3. CIA has worked closely with the Board and its staff
from the beginning. The Board's Executive Director and we have
worked out cooperative arrangements for resolving differences
of opinion as to what information can be released to the public
and what should be withheld because of sensitivities. We have
released approximately 227,000 pages of relevant Agency records
