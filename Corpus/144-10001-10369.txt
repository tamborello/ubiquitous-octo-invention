You have met- Me. LYNDON JOHNSON several times.’ May we ask you,
sis of the conversations which you had with him-in
what your impressions of bhe, mew Feeatdepe of the
United States are? + mt :

Answer: Well. It is true that I nad the good fortune to
have talks with the new President’ ‘of the United States, scarcely
two weeks ago, and these talks inspired my confidence, } I had
the feeling that the Vice President completely. ‘shared President
KENNEDY 's political ideas. .1 believe that he is a very ex-
perienced man and that there is no’ teason to doubt his:wish to
follow President KENNEDY's policy. Therefore it is necessary
to have confidence and to work with him with’ the same desire for
co-operation as that which we Showed to President KENNEDY.
