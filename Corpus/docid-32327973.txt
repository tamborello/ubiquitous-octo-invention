Re: Salvatore Granello Wf

it has been alkged that an individual named De Joie,
the former Prime Minister of Haiti, is leading a revoluntionary
group from the Dominican Republic in an attempt to overthrow
the government of Haiti.

 

Salvatore Granello, a member of the New York criminal
element, has indicated a desire to establish gambling casinos
in Haiti. It has been alleged that when De Joie requested
$20,000 in cash immediately to purchase arms and food, Granello
and James Plumeri, who is also interested in establishing
gambling in Haiti, backed off temporarily since they did not
want to lay out this amount of cash.
