5. In the Pittsburgh area if anyone has a bank

he gets police protection. If he goes along
fairly well someone from the organization wii1l

co Because of the fact that this was the first
‘ time informant really began to open up, SA PORTELLA
chose not to make copious detailed notes and chose
not to ask detailed questions because he felt that to
' do either of these things might cause the informant
to suddenly stop talking. During the interview informant
touched upon the following items:

1. TONY GROSSO of Pittsburgh is an independent

'* numbers operator whose only ally is the Deputy
Superintendent of Pittsburgh Police Department
LAWRENCE J, MALONEY. GROSSO is the biggest '
book and/or bank in Western Pennsylvania and
it is generally conceded that he supplies the
Pittsburgh Police Department, through MALONEY,
with information that they use to eliminate
competition for him. GROSSO has a current .
girlfriend in the Greentree section of :
Pittsburgh, whose husband drives a Pittsburgh :
‘Post-Gazette or Pittsburgh Press newspaper
truck, The husband is aware of GROSSO's
relationship with his wife and tolerates it.
He-allegedly purchased for this girlfriend
a new 1963: Cadillac automobile. GROSSO |
has been the topic of discussions many . ‘
times among the soldiers or workers. Several
offers were extended to cause him trouble,
put. JOHN: LA ROCCA vetoed any of these moves A)

 

 

because he did not want trouble stirred up
in Pittsburgh. . '

2. When informant ran the Bachelor's Club in
_East Liberty for CHUCK TEEMER (in essence
for JOHN LAROCCA), he had complete control ae
and recalled that for a two year period he
paid Deputy Superintendent LAWRENCE J,
MALONEY of the Pittsburgh Police Department,
$1,500: a week cash, i

and on more than one occasion has stopped hasty drastic
action that the others wanted to take, and the matter was
settled peacefully.

-

Informant stated that the gambling syndicate or
organization in Pittsburgh is set up as follows:

JOHN LA ROCA and FRANK AMATO are the leaders or
besses, TONY RIPEPPI was a leader but he is retired and
has little or no voice, The next leader or sub-boss is
GABRIEL MANNARINO who is married to the daughter of FRANK |
AMATO. Below MANNARINO are the folowing who might be
called lieutenants: '

 

JOE SICA. LOUIS VOLPE.
JOE ROSA MICHAEL GENOVESE

Below the deutenants are the soldiers or workers namely, . . j
AL ROSS, FRANK VALENTI, JOHN FONTANA, PHIL GENOVESE and
LOU MILANO (deceased). &

CHARLES FREDERICK TEEMER, who operated the Jockey
Club and now the Red, Dog in Chester, W. Va., accounts only
to JOHN LA ROCCA who gets 50 per cent of everything that
TEEMER has in operation no matter where he is,

JOE ROSA exerts control ‘of YEE TERLESKI of
Pittsburgh's South Side, and he obtains the lion's share
of everything that TERLISKI has operating for him anywhere,
.ROSA in turn contributes to JOHN LA ROCCA and accepts
orders from LA ROCCA.

 

JIMMY HOFFA, President of the Teamsters Union,
is acquainted with both JOHN LA ROMA and GABRIEL MANNARINO
and whenever HOFFA really wants something in Pittsburgh

_he calls on one of these two.’ JACK ARMAND, also known : ;
as. ARMANDO CARLOMAGNO; President of the Taxi Cab Union
of Pittsburgh, is flashy and loud and gives everyone in
Pittsburgh the impression that he is HOFFA's contact in
Pittsburgh but actually this is not true.

. - By way of history of the setup in Pittsburgh,
informant related the following:

LA ROCCA succeeded JOHN BAZZANO, SR., who was

the undisputed. leader of Pittsburgh. BAZZANO, overwhelmed

with his importance, ordered the killing of the three

VOLPE brothers of Pittsburgh, MIKE SPAMQLI (Phonetic)

carried out the execution of the VOLPE boyS. ‘SPAMOLI ‘

is allegedly in prison in Italy where he is serving a ‘

life sentence for murder, Informant said this crime

was not sanctioned by the organization and the killing

of moe ‘than one member of a particular family is .

always looked upon with disfavor, The only two additional
“items that cause trouble in the organization are stealing i

another member's wife and/or his money. i

After the VOLPE killings, JOHN BAZZANO went’
to New York to attend a banquet given in honor of |
JOE MASSERIA (Phonetic), a big boss of the organization.
' BAZZANO knew he was in trouble with everyone over the :
VOLPE killings and when it came to his turn to make a
toast he asked those present what they were waiting
\ for and why they did not get his killing over with.
' As soon as BAZZANO completed his comments each of the '
32 men present stabbed him with an ice pick and his |
dead body was shipped on to Pittsburgh.

 

 

According to the informant, this gave JOHN
LA ROCCA his chance and inspite of the informants
opposition and the opposition of FRANK VAIENTI, LA ROCCA .
gained solid control’ in Fitvisburgh. As a result of their
opposition, informant and / VALBNTT were branded as “outlaw
soldiers," Since that time, they have had to live by : i
their wits and.do not enjoy the wealth that the others .
who are "in" enjoy. .

Informant said that he first met FRANK VALENTI i
in Cleveland, Ohio, many years ago and it was VALENTI
who brought him to, Pittsburgh and later introduced him to
the MANNARINOs of? Mew Kensington. ;

. Informant is presently living. at the Hotel
Carlton, Room 1302, Pittsburgh, where he intends to
remain until the several. cases in which he is involved
are disposed of.

On 1/9/64, informant and JOSEPH MEROLA contacted
SA JOHN S. PORTELLA at the Pittsburgh, Pa.-.office, and
indicated that they desired to talk to SA JOHN S, PORTELLA.
They suggested that SA PORTELLA come to Room.1302.

SA PORTELLA went to Room 1302, Carlton House
Hotel, where JOSEPH MEROLA was busy packing to return to
Miami, Florida on a 7:40 P.M, flight. They both commented
that they had worked on a business deal and earned.a little
money but not enough to meet all their expenses.

JOSEPH MEROLA left the hotel for the airport,
leaving SA PORTELLA and informant alone,

: 8 SA PORTELLA noved that the informarit was in an
extremely good mood and appeared to be willing to talk
about matters that heretofore he refused to. talk about.
Informant remarked that he desired to help "straighten
out" certain facts that the FBI might be interested in
provided he could be assured that he would not have to
testify in Federal Court or before any investigative or

administrative committeés. and that his name would not be used
nor made public in any way unless he first approved it.
Informant was told that any information he furnished would be
treated as confidential and no attempts would be made to force
him into testifying unless he first agreed to it. Informant
said that with this understanding he would be willing to
relate a few of his experiences and some of his knowledge of
what he termed "the outfit."

; Informant remarked that he has been with "the outfit"
since he was 16 years old and has associated with this element
from coast to coast for the last 41-years. He claims that at
age 16 {n Cleveland, Ohio, he began running “booze" for the
organization there, He considers himself a soldier or worker :
who has faithfully carried out orders given him and, as a result
of this, he gained a reputation and stakure throughout the
United States,

He claims that there is a tightly knit "gambling
syndicate" operating throughout the United States and member~
ship in it is not limited to Italians only. He states that the
primary requisite for membership is that one be engaged in :
gambling, regardless of nationality. The italians have taken ‘
over the ieadership of the gambling world and while they make !
the big decisions in it, others such as,Jews, Irish, Polish © i
and so forth are part of the operation. The Italians have
gone a step further than the others, in that members of their
respective families intermarried and this made the bond much
tighter.

 

Informant said that it is better to say that there is
a "gambling organization or syndicate" in which the Italians are
the leaders rather’ than to:say that the Italians have a criminal
syndicate. .known:as LA COSA NOSTRA or the MAFIA: with the meniezship:)
' being exclusively Italian. He:said that:he knows from first
hand knowledge‘that:the gambling: syndicate looks down on crimes
of violence and crimes involving narcotics and prostitution.
Only in a few isolated cases would the organization approve
such actions, ;

 

For example, he stated that JOHN LA ROCCA of
Pittsburgh, is one of the most’ peacful leaders in whe
country. If someone inhis group steps out of bounds,

LA ROCCA will gO out of his way to check the circumstances
