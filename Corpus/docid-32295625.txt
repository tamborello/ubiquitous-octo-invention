business as a channel for secret funds. Therefore, they are
only interested in high level burglaries and trailer loads

of merchandise. This attitude should discourage the street
level hoodlum from attempting to unload the proceeds of a
low level robbery, i.e. a purse-snatching, at the business.
However, for the individual or group more prominent in the
eriminal hierarchy, no deal will be too large or too small
for perusal by the operation. .

Chicago made arrangements with the Austin Resident
Agency, San Antonio Division, to have a background entered
for the UTSA into the Texas Drivers License Computer. The
background was furnished to FBI Liaison at Austin with the
Chief of the Texas Drivers License Bureau by letter which
accomplished the entry by legal means. Notations in the
computer will reflect the actual Texas license was reported
lost by the individual and application was made by him for
a State of Illinois Drivers License. Chicago made the actual
application for the Illinois Drivers License and furnished
an appropriate cover letter to the Chief Investigator of the
Secretary of States Office, who has had liaison established
in the past with the Field Supervisor at Chicago directing
this operation. Other UT. identifiers for the UTSA have been
applied for through FBI ‘Liaison under separate cover.

and a guest list of those in attendance is being obtained
