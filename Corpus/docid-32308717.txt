military leader _of the anti-Communist erganization known fbbe
as Movimiento..Democnata.Cnistiano.(MDC}, heacquabtered at _
1732 N. W. 7th Street, Miami, advised that he had never
heard of the ACI, and although he had been personally
acquainted with ALEXANDER I. RORKE, Jr., he had never
heard RORKE mention this organization., BATISTA
estimated that. for RORKE to properly maintain his boat, .
the "Violyn III," which is worth about $10,000.00, and his
seacheraft, which is worth about $50,000.00, RORKE
would have to have had about $2,000.00 a month income. \
BATISTA said he did not know the source of RORKE's funds,
of which he never spoke, but BATISTA had not doubt
that through RORKE's lecture tours, he was able to meet
a number of people who were willing and eble to make
large donations.

Communist Youth work in Israel, but because cf the Communistic

. WILLIAMS advised the source not to worry. '
He said that although he has little money at the

moment, he was to meet two individuals on January 7th >
and 8th (1964) to arrange financing and that, he would talk '
to them and try to raise some more money. Km

NY T-2 stated that WILLIAMS advised that he
belongs to no organization, that the operation is
entirely a private venture. WILLIAMS added that several
people lost a great deal of money when CASTRO took over i
Cuba, and that many of these persons are now willing
to finance an operation which will drive CASTRO and the
other Communists cut of Cuba so that they could recover
their lost propertice. (i) !

WILLIAMS stated that he had talked to “the
General of the Cossacks" but that the General's wife
is sick and might die. He said that he really does not
know what to do about the General. He said that this
is ancther example of SCHIEBER talkjng too much and
trying to push things too fast. ro

. WILLIAMS said that another such example was

ALEXANDER RORKE. He said that RORKE flew to a
small island off ‘the tip of Yucatan, near the
Honduras coast. He was supposed to.make a refueling stop
at this particular place. Unknown to anyone else,

’ RORKE picked up a third man named GARCIA... Although RORKE
was supposed to be flying tc Panama, and had filed a flight
plan for this destination, as soon as GARCIA was picked up H
and the plane was airborn, he radioed that he was changing’
his course and destination to Honduras. WILLIAMS said that
he kept telling RORKE that he was handling things all
wrong, but RORKE would not listen’to him. He said that
when RORKE left, he had a tremendous amount of money with
him, and that this money disappeared with RORKE. He said that
RORKE was travelling with a pilot nained SULLIVAN, who had
flown RORKE many times before. After the plane took off 4
from Yucatan, it was not seen again. He said that ;
since no wreckage has ever been found, he jis convinced that
the plane was forced to land in Cuba. yoo) : ;

in such plans. SCHIEBER thanked the source for this
information and he said that he would not contact
anyone from the Free Lithuania Committee. U

SCHIEBER said that his group is’ and®ious to
