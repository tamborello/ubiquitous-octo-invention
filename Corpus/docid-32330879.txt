a success, as he later heard Mrs. PECORA mention to
someone that KEITH had sold SCHWEGMANN some vitamin .
tablets for stocking in three of the stores.

and during the course of this dinner a number of items

Source said that the original agreement with
BALOGNA was that although BALOGNA owned property, he had
placed this property in the name of his son-in-law, PHILIP
f CIACCIO, in order that there would be no inheritance tax
| to pay when BALOGNA died. The agreement was made at the
time of the signing of the $100,000 note between PECORA ;
and CIACCIO that upon the sale of any of this property |
that PECORA would be repayed any money which he might be
required to expend in satisfaction of the note. Source
said that he learned from PECORA that to date, CIACCIO
has not paid one cent towards the liquidation of the note
of his late father-intlaw and has completely alienated
himself from PECORA by his various acts. a

Source advised that the reason PECORA has been
forced to repay the money is that the original $100,000
note was placed wits the bank, and it was necessary to
mortgage the property at 6027 Chef Menteur Highway, which
is now known as the Tropical Building and Tropical
Trailer Park.

 

Source advised that in recent conversations with
NOFIO PECORA that PECORA reminisced about "the good old days"
and said that the time he talked about before when CORRADO
GIACONA got him out of trouble by sending him to Chicago to
get a new job was actually the beginning of a new. life for him.
He said that the person that he was instructed to see in
Chicago, the person he was sent to meet was AL CAPONE. He
said that upon his arrival in Chicago he met with CAPONE
and was given the job at the Union League Club as mentioned
before. Source said that PECORA reminisced about CAPONE
for awhile, stating that he was well regarded by most of
the Italians, as he liked to paay the role of Robin Hood and
could often be seen giving money to the poor Italians.

On 3/28/73, NO 1283-C-TE advised that he recently
saw JOSEPH PORETTO when they both were visiting NOFIO PECORA
at the Methodist Hospital, where PECORA was confined for
several days in connection with high blood pressure and a
slight heart condition. Source said that PORETTO seemed to
be in good spirits and was discussing with PECORA the
possibility of PECORA's purchasing a small farm or acreage
outside the Greater New Orleans Metropolitan area. Source
said that PECORA told him that he is currently offering
his business for sale for $850,000, and has a great desire
to retire in hopes that he will live longer.

recently been in touch with several of his long-time
friends as a result of some of the wakes and funerals

people, including NOFIO PECORA, who reminisced for awhile

to him that "These young punks don't know nothin’." Source
said that PECORA reminisced about "the Black Hand" and said

guys I dealt with are dead now."

Source said that PECORA told him that he was
happy to see JIMMY CAMPO die, and said, "That's good
riddance." Source said that he then questioned PECORA

stood up for the girl, not for him."' Source said that
CAMPO, according to PECORA, was one of the six original

’ guys who came down to New Orleans from "back East" and

New Orleans natives.

: Source said that PECORA gave him the impression
from the way he talked that there currently are several
factions of "organized crime" elements currently within
the New Orleans area. Source said that it was his 7
impression from talking to PECORA that PECORA was a "Black
Hand," and did not care to be identified with the current
version of the Mafia or La Cosa Nostra.

. Source said that PECORA told him that when he
originally purchased the Fropical Tourist Courts in about
1954 or 1955, PECORA expended all of the money that he had
been able to raise to purchase the business, and when he
was requested by the electric company to post a $1,000
advance fee, he cou not do so. He said that PECORA then

 

contacted Mr. PHILI UAGLINO, since QUAGLINO had a
cigarette machine in e tourist court office at the time
of the purchase, He said that PECORA endeavored to obtain
$1,000 from QUAGLINO, and QUAGLINO refused to. lend him

the money. Source said that PECORA then went to the new
owner of Crescent Cigarette Service and obtained the $1,000
loan. Later, during a wake ewer mutual friend, PECORA

 

. |
observed CARLOSWWRCELLO, JOEWWARCELLO, Jr., WSNCENT La
RCELLO, and several other asswciates standing with PHILIP ,

JUAGLINO. When QUAGLINO spoke to PECORA and attempted to a
ake fafids with him, PECORA spat in his face.

      
 

This recollection was triggered on the part of
PECORA when the source mentioned to him that he had heard
4 the story about the time that JIMMY CAMPO allegedly spat in
the face of CARLOS MARCELLO, who which PECORA replied, —
"I'm the guy who spit in somebody's face." Source said that
PECORA told him that he knew nothing of the alleged incident
between CAMPO and MARCELLO.

On 10/30/72, NO 1283-C-TE advised that about
two months ago it came to his attention that JOHN SCHWEGMANN
had been contacted by NOFIO and FRANCES PECORA, and FRANCES
PECORA inféroduced a man named JOHN KEITH, who supposedly
represented FRANCES PECORA's brother DALTON SMITH. The
purpose of this introduction was to attempt to interest
SCHWEGMANN in a line of vitamin supplements produced
by the Weider Company of California, wherein SCHWEGMANN
would purchase these items and stock them in his nine
supermarkets. Source said that apparently the meeting was
