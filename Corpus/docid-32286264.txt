In the early part of 1963, informant obtained
option for operation of a gambling casino at Normandy
Hotel, San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he and his brother have
other business interests. Informant is anxious to obtain
financial backing on a partnership basis in this venture.
In July, 1963, he read an article in the magazine section
of a Miami, Florida newspaper indicating that SAM GIANCANA,
the well-known Chicago hoodlum, was seeking partnership
arrangements with American businessmen who could obtain
gambling concessions in the Caribbean area and South
America, which article indicated GIANCANA interested in
‘investment in such ventures. U

 

: ._ Subsequently, informant contacted an acquaintance,
DAVID SAX, of Chicago, owner or former owner of Saxony Hotel,
Miami, Florida, and now a banker in Chicago, formerly a
manufacturer of punch beards. He told him of the article
and. asked how GIANCANA could be approached. SAX told the
informant he knew one of GIANCANA's close business associates
and could arrange a contact. v

 

: : Some time later, informant received telephone
call from one DAVE (last name unknown) and TEDDY (last
name unknown), who claimed to be GIANCANA's business
associates and desired a meeting to discuss the matter. v

Informant met DAVE and TEDDY in Miami, Florida,

‘and they seemed to know considerable about his financial

standing, the fact that his resources were committed and’ 4

that the brother of informant was principal controller of
their business interests.

 

At first, DAVE and TEDDY wanted to know some thing
of informant's connections to assure themselves he could
get gambling concessions in Puerto Rico. and/or another
Caribbean area.

In the presence of DAVE and TEDDY, informant
called L, O, PENDLING, a Negro attorney and membey of Parliament,
Nassau, Bahamas, with whom PCI had had prior business
associations and made an appointment to meet PENDLING in :
Washington, D.C., in late August, 1963. PENDLING was . |
unable to keep the appointment since the March on J) : {
Washington made it impossible to get hotel reservations. .
