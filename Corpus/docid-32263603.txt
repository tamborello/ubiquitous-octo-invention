AT SEATTLE, WASHINGTON oO — —— -

The following le was received by SA GEORGE L.
LEWIS from Commander R. W,ASMILEY, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard

Bremerton, Washington. P rked Bremerton, Washington, |
August 23, 1964, which states as follows: oe.

“Dear Commander Smiley: oo, here ee

. “Please destroy this letter just as soon as you ;
have read it because it is probably extremely dangerous
even to be writing it. As I told you when I was upset
about my son's letter from Panama--you're the most —~
influential person I know & that is why I am entrusting
this confidence to you. -

"We do not always know | exactly how close. :
another world is to us. I only know that sometimes
I get ‘designs' € perhaps messages from ‘somewhere.* -
Something is impelling me to write you tonight that _
more investigation should be made of Pres. Kennedy's .
death. You see people from Wash D.C. often--there
must be some way you can get word to the Pres‘ brother
Bobby Kennedy that he should do some careful but .- :..
_ strenuous investigation. One of the wedenesses of
we people who are raised in the Kennedy's circumstances

; is that they have known too little of ‘struggle’... -

& feel that all persons are honest € straight forward
& kindly like themselves not having enough knowledge
of the motivation that will lead less fortunate -.

people to lie & steal € kill for power & prestige. "

' This too trusiess attitude was death for Pres. Kennedy.

I for one do not want to cast a vote in the next election.

_ for the forces that brought about his murder. I don't: -
‘believe for a minute that Oswald did this thing on his

own--or even that he was a communist tool--there are .

- too many persons in our own country who could have had
' strong reasons for killing the President for certain

stands he was taking. oo
