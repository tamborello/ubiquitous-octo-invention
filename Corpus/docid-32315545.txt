stated that he heard that MIKE RUBINO supposedgy "had a hand" in
DANNY COSENTINO’s operation too, although, Informant emphasized,
he would think that COSENTINO's "book" belonged to TONY GIACALONE.
He added that "BREEZY" can be found every Sunday in a restaurant
on Dix owned by the brother of TOMMY KARAMANOS, a missing Greek~
town gambler who is believed to be a victim of gan gland
assassination.

Informant advised that MIKE RUBINO. formerly owned

\ the Navahoe Bar on E. Jefferson Ave. but that a number of years

ago he sold the bar to NICK DITTA and FRANKIE MUDARO, Informant
revealed that DITTA and MUDARO worked the bar for a while and then
DITTA burned the place down. He added that DITTA and MUDARO
collected from the insurance company also.

Informant advised that ABIE RAHAIM is being sought
by the Detroit. Police Dept. following a numbers raid on ‘an office
on Orchestra Place which was operated by RAHAIM, Informant said
that RAHAIM lives on E. Outer Drive near Harper Ave. He said that
RAHAIM has worked for EDDIE WINGATE for several years and that he
does much of WINGATE'’s betting on the horses and also handles
WINGATES’ Layoffs" to the "horse books" around town. Informant
said that RAHAIM has the "horse disease" and that he lives with
the Negroes now, working in WINGATE's numbers and horse books and
handling some of WINGATE's many race horses. Informant added that
the talk is that RAHAIM is in Florida "on the lam" from the Detroit
Police.

Informant revealed that the wining number comes
out ‘around 5:30 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. each night six days a week.
He said that this is about the time that the last digit is received
from the single action offices. Informant stated that the winning
number is followed closely by numbers people, including workers and
bettors, as it is "turned out" by the single action, the lst
digit, the 2nd digit, the 3rd digit, and so on. He said that, to
get an idea of the enormity of numbers betting in Detroit, a per-
son need only try to dial a WAlnut exchange around the time the
number gets out. He commented that the winning number gets _
around town in less than seven minutes and most of these contacts
are by telephone. He advised that shortly after the winning
number is “turned out" you sometimes wait up to three minutes
for a dial tone in the WAlnut exchange, which covers-a predomin-
antly Negro area in Detroit.

“Informant advised that he has long known of a>

dévice to "prostrate" the numbers in Detroit. He said that the
numbers would be thrown into "complete turmoil” if someone
(Such as the FBI) should print up a phony “green sheet". In-
formant offered that this "green sheet" should be a duplicate
of the numbers tip sheet printed up and distributed weekly by |
the syndicate in Detroit, although it should reflect that a
number of "fancies" fell the previous week, numbers which are
played daily on a very heavy basis by many bettors. These
numbers, of course, would be printed in the "green sheet" in
place of the. actual winning numbers which had previously come __
out. Informant emphasized that the phone company would be tied -
up completely ten minutes after the phony tip sheet came out.

He: said that not a numbers writer in Detroit could show his face
onthe streets the following day. The volume of complaints from
bettors, who used ‘the "green sheet" as their "numbers bible", for
twenty-five years and who hand't. been paid on a "hit", as they ~
can see it:.reflected in the phony "green sheet", would be
‘staggering. ~~. : : ;

 
 
 
 

; - Infermant stated that one could print up no more -
than 1000 phony "green sheets" which would be put out on Friday
' for just two weeks. He said that the "green sheets" came out.

to each package. Informant offered to distribute such a phony
numbers tip sheet.. He said that he would drop off four bundles
of phony sheets at each of four locations in different parts

-of town. .Informant advised that he would sugreptitiously leave
_a bundle of 250 tip sheets at a blind pig on Canfield Avenue

pundle of 250 at a blind pig on Brush Street, another bundle.
at a numbers headquarters in the barbershop he knows on 12th . .

Informant advised that JOHN DE FOREST finally
got out on bond on the "meat case", He said that Dr. JOSEPH
RASAK told him that on the day following DE FOREST's release
DE FOREST came to him (RASAK) and demanded $4590.00. Informant
stated that DE FOREST apparently thinks that it was Dr. RASAK
who "put him down". He said that obviously DE FOREST must have
something good on RASAK, at least enough to "put RASAK in the
grease", or else why the shakedown. Informant stated that
DE FOREST demanded that RASAK have the $4500.00 in DE FOREST's
attorney's office by Friday afternoon, 4/5/63. Informant
stated that he does not know the identity of DE FOREST's attorney
nor actualiy, for that matter, that DE FOREST even had an
attorney. Informant advised that Dr. RASAK pays "juice" weekly
to SAMMY FINE on a shylock loan he has with JOHNNY SERRA,

Informant advised that he recently ran into Little

EDDIE MORAN at the coffee house on E. Jefferson across the street |
from Fr. HEALEY's Antique Store near the Chrysler Expressway.
He said that he mentioned to ‘MORAN that he frequently sees MORAN's
old "sidekick", DAVEY EDWARDS and MORAN pleaded with Informant not
to mention to EDWARDS or any of EDWARDS associates that MORAN was
in town. Informant stated that MORAN told him that he was now '
working with "some guys" in Youngstown, Ohio. Informant advised
that he believed that EDDIE MORAN was “working the pigeon drop"
or else "going with the switch", ie a type of con game, in Youngs~—

’ town, Ohio. ;

Informant stated that LOUIE PETERS, who owns
Master Realty, 13331 Mack Avenue, telephone VA 22600, had
the real estate listing for HANK THOMAS' home. Informant said
that PETERS told him that THOMAS pulled his house off the market
recently. He stated that THOMAS is "in a world of trouble" *
as he has now "double-crossed" the Judge who sentenced him and
who stipulated that THOMAS must move out of the neighborhood.
Informant advised that, from stories he hears from PETERS,
THOMAS' neighbors want to force THOMAS out of the Grosse Pointe
area but THOMAS does not want to go. He said that THOMAS is con-
sidered to have plenty of money though he has moved his wife and
children out of the family home. Informant stated that he heard
that HANK THOMAS actually had been carrying on an affair with
the mother of the young girl THOMAS was sentenced to jail for
molesting and that THOMAS now intends to use this “affair" as a.
"big stick" to hold over the head of the doctor, who is the
father of the young girl supposedly victimized by THOMAS and who
was the one pressing the case against HANK THOMAS, in order to ;
stay in the neighborhood. '

pocket" to “pay the coppers" ini many instances where "the outfit"

in wouldn't “come up with" the money. He stated that EDWARDS told
him at length about a Detroit Police Sergeant, DAVE HARRIS, who
is now assigned to the 13th Precinct, who "has to be" one of the
richest cops in Detroit as he has been "shaking down" gamblers and
hoodlums for years. Informant said that EDWARDS told him that
years ago DAVE HARRIS arrested him on numbers and took $6200.00
‘as "evidence" off him. EDWARDS claimed that when he "got off"
the charge and went to get his money only $1300.00 had been .

steal" for years. A
