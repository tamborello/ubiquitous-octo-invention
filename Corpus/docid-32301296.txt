that it had originally been sponsored by some unknown
cultural ; gxoup.. In connection with CONTE's broadcast,’
he mentioned the name of the station as “WRUL" and when
asked to repeat it, did so in the same manner. It is.
noted, however, that he named the station manager as Mr.
BRENT and that New York letter of June 15, 1962, (Bufile
109-584, New York file 105-35255), page 9, sets forth
information identifying a Mx. BRENT as the president of
radio station WWRL in New York City. Accordingly, it i
possible that CONTE is working for station WWRL rather than
WRUL, as he indicated.

s

During interview, CONTE stated that he has been in’
contact with CIA representatives in Miami for some time and
that he furnishes them with information which. he receives
in letters from Cuba in response to his radio broadcasts.

He noted that the CIA representative has never ackgowledged
to him that they are sponsoring his broadcasts. CE)( 4)

As CONTE has disbanded the subiect organization
and is active in radio propaganda work,/apparently for or)
no further investigation of this matter 1s believed
warranted at this time. .
