SF. 2550-C-TE advised on July 24, 1964, that
MRS. ALEX CAMARATA returned from Irvington, New Jersey,
where she had attended the .Golden Wedding Anniversary
of her parents, MR. and MRS. JOHN MISURACA. MRS. CAMARATA
indicated that the anniversary party was small and was
held at a small restaurant of a friend of her father in
Irvington. She stated photos of the party were taken,
which Informant will attempt to obtain in the future in
order that copies may be made.

MRS. CAMARATA indicated that her father
expressed concern about the trouble that had been caused
in the New York area among the members of La Cosa Nostra.
Informant is of the opinion this referred to the GALLO-
PROFACI feud in the PROFACI Family of New York. MRS. CAMARATA
stated because of this trouble the wives of the members of
La Cosa Nostra have become fearful for their personal safety
and many of them have taken to carrying switchblade knives
in their purses. She stated that her mother carries a
switchblade knife in her purse and that MADELYN GRECCO,
her sister of Brooklyn, New York, has carried one in her
purse for a long period of time.
