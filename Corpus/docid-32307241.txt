On 6-11-54 CI HAV-11-C advised that he had been informed the -

MEYERYTANSKY, well known U. S. hoodlum, is planning on setting up 4 large _

\ operation in Cuba, exect nature of which is as yet unknown to informant. VN
said he had been told that the locally well known law firm of NEST #\\y

is é NDOZA has been retained to handle the legal technicalities involved in iy

Digs setting up a company in Cuba. Informant said that he was told that the

operation will run into large sums of money and he was of the opinion thatd:*.

TANSKY OO trying to get away from the more rigid controls of U. S. !
Uu .

 
 
  

It will be recalled that IANSKY had a piece of the gambling é
casino in the Montmrtre night club in Hevana in the 1952-53 season. -
This office received no information to indicate that he was connected with’
gambling activities here in the 1953-54 season. (3) Bw

This matter will be followed closely and the Bureau will be
advised of any additional developments. ‘

Apart and unconnected with the above, source advised on the same
date that he had recently been told by a person he considers reliable that
NORMANROTHMAN, FBI No. 1525858, had offered this person $200,000 of
counterfeit U. S. currency at 12% of the face value. Source said the
person told him that he was not having anything to do with the operation.

It is believed entirely possible that ROTHMAN may be making
this offer. He is known to have been forced to close the Sans Souci
night club and gambling casino, which he had been operating in Havana,
due to lack of money. Information has been received that he has @ number
of debts in Havana and ROTHMAN himself has ntly advised this office
that be hardly has "bread money” anymoree Wy NS —

Source recalled that three or four years ago JACKIXfAVIS, wasey , o -—
FBI No. 1159304, had offered the source a similar quantity of counterfeit
money and he believes that this may be the same money which ROTHMAN is
trying to push. DAVIS was at that time cqnnected with ROTHMAN in the
Sans Souci as a shill and steerer. s last known t been in -
