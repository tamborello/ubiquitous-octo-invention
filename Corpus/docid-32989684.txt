The Honorable Edward H. Levi O67 23 1975

Attorney General

U.S. Department of Justice

Washington, D. C. 20530 0 LA

Dear Mr. Levi:

One of the objectives of this Committee is to establish
the cost of domestic intelligence. This letter is to request
that you provide FY 76 budget numbers (dollars and manpower)
concerning intelligence activities and intelligence related
activities within your Department. Should this kind of data
not be readily available, by Department, Bureau, Administration,
etc., your best estimate and an explanation as to how the
computations were made will suffice. We have a good deal of
budgetary. data re: FBI, DEA, etc. already. However, it is in
a format that does not readily lend itself to isolating intelli-
gence activities per se, hence this request.

Should there be any questions regarding this matter, Roger
Carroll of this staff, at 225-9751, is available for more
details. We would appreciate your response by October 31, 1975.

Sincerely,

Okabe

A. Searle Field
Staff Director

Director Sec’y —_

Attached is a memorandum from Michael E. Shaheen, ,,
Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the ip?
Department, addressed to John A. Mintz, Assistant Director, c
Legal Counsel Division, dated October 9, 1975. The memorandum
instructs the Bureau to provide access to the House Select Com=-
mittee Staff Members to the Kissinger 17 material which was
previously made available for review by the Senate Select Com-
mittee. This material is exclusive of logs pertaining to 4
electronic surveillance matters.

Upon receipt of attached memorandum, SA Paul V. Daly
of this Division telephonically contacted Steven Blackhurst,
Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the
Department, and advised Blackhurst that the instructions insofar
as allowing the House Select Committee Staff Members to take notes
on the materials and remove these notes without screening y Bureau
personnel back to their offices was contrary to the agreemient set
forth in the Departmental letter to the Senate Select Committee of
July 15, 1975. This letter required prior Bureau screening of
notes taken by Staff Members during their review of the afore-
mentioned material. Blackhurst subsequently advised SA Daly that
the Committee was agreeable to having their notes screened by
Bureau personnel prior to their removal to their offices.
Blackhurst was then informed that inasmuch as this involved the
State Department and the White House, the Department should ad-
vise the appropriate representatives of the White House and the
State Department of the aforementioned matter, especially in view
of information furnished by the Committee indicating that Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger would be testifying in executive session
before the House Select Committee og Friday, October. 3lst.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: HOUSTUDY ©

 

On 10/30/75, Shaheen telephonically advised SA Daly
that the Committee representatives were on their way with
Blackhurst to Bureau space to review the Kissinger 17 materials
and that Daly was to advise Blackhurst that the Attorney General
had instructed the Committee not be granted access to the materials.
Upon arrival, Staf£ Members for the House Select Committee John
Atkisson and Timothy Oliphant were advised of the Attorney General's
decision by Blackhurst. Oliphant promptly consulted with Committee
Counsel. Aarron Donner and Donner advised Blackhurst that the Com-
mittee was. considering issuing subpoenas for the material and
would hold a press conference concerning the Department's noncomp-
liance with the Committee request. Blackhurst indicated to SA
Daly that ‘he was not fully cognizant of the background concerning
the Attorney General's instruction; however, apparently the White
House had instructed the Attorney General not to make the material
available. He stated that he had informed the White House of the
aforementioned requést and their compliance thereof. early on the
morning of October. 30th and that the White House had apparently
telephoned the Department objecting to making the material avail-
able.

Subsequently, Blackhurst telephonically advised SA Daly
that the Attorney General had teviewed the motion to modify the
Protective Order covering the Kissinger 17 documents which was
filed on October 28, 1975, and signed by the Judge on October 29,
1975, which allowed for Housé Select Committee access to the
documents protected by a Protective Order which was issued by
that court on June 28, 1975, with the exception of electronic
surveillance logs. The Attorney General after this review in-
structed that the material be made available.
