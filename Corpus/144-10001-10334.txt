carry out its firm policies, The flood of opposition parties,
including the Civil Rule Party, opened a fierce struggle to block
the guarantee of a majority policy by the party in power under the
slogan "Check government dictatorship." In their general election
campaign they did not confront the [Democratic Republican Party]
policy and they began an attack which offered.‘no counterproposals.

tion to manage this historic day's election cleanly and fairly,

out the country it has been decided that the ballot counting will
begin immediately at the 196 vote counting stations, It is felt
that the results of the elections will be fully confirmed on the
afternoon of 27 November. (Seoul Sinmun)

originated by a number of overly loyal officials who disregarded
the real meaning of the Government's pledge that the elections
would be unprecedentedly clean. '"He went on to say, "It is a
fact that the P'aju ~ Hamp’yo'ng case had already taken shape and
the people knew everything; however, because the Mokp’o Police
Superintendent said that he alone had taken part in the Mokp'o
case, evidence on the Police Superintendent is now being collected
so that public action may be taken, This not expected to extend
