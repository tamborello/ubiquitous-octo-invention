ADHUNISTRATIVE

In connection with YITO SABIA, a highly confidential source.
has been developed which is designated as NH 413-Cr.

In connect‘ on with RALPH TROPIANO, serious efforts have been
made to develop a highly confidential source im the newly _
constructed residence of WILLIAM PHILIP GRASSO, the closest
associate with TROPIANO in the operation of his numbers .
business. There was a gang style killing in New Haven,

Conn. on or about 11/24/62, and at the present time, TROPIANO
and GRASSO are considered the prime suspects. In view of |
the "heat" on TROPIANO and GRASSO by police authorities
investigating this matter, efforts to develop a highly
confidential source in connection with TROPIANO’s operations
have been temporarily discontinued,

 

 

It has also been recently learned that because of the
above-mentioned “heat” by police authorities, the office
for the TROPIANO operation has been moved to Bridgeport,
Conn., and for the time being, is being operated by JOSEPH
"SHORTY" GAMBARDELLA, another trusted employee of TROPIANO.

In connection with FRANK LEWIS PICCOLO, some efforts are
being made to develop a highly confidential source in the’
alleged office of PICCOLO and DAVID TACOVETTI at Newtown, - _'
Conn. Set forth in this report is information in connection

i>. with their opening a drive-in restaurant to be known as thie |
"Straw Hat”, which will possibly also be used for PICCOLO's
gambling activities.
