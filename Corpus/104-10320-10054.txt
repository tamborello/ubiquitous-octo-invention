Subj : Request for Information under FOIA on OSWALD

 

- We have attached a copy of the print-out on OSWe D from the
U.S. Defector Machine Program, a sub-program of the Soviet GICS
Machine Program. (The 26 page computer print-out to which Mr.:
Lané makes reference is probably the file content listing, It is
remarkable that FOIA requests now and then indicate leaks of -:
information. )- Under the terms published in the Federal Register,
we are not.obligated to provide (a) material from newspapers, books,
and’ other overt sources; nor (b) information provided by other USG
agencies; nor. (c) information provided by foreign services. Data --
from those three sources ‘have been marked in yellow, leaving only” :
some 16 lines,’ ‘CThe. sources are SB Division's SPR filed in 201-305052 .
and HMMA-~ 31932... . Lassume that both of these sources involve foreign
liaison, and hence are exempt.) In any case, there is ‘nothing in the .
machine summary which is not covered by the 201, If you want to send -
the machine dossier along to DDO/FOIO, I have no objection, but nothing _
from this machine dossier should be passed to the requester.
