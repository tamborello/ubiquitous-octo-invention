an interview with BARTONE, Miami would be so advised. In view
of this fact, it is not recommended that BARTONE be interviewed
in subject case at this time. -UACB, this will not be done.

In view of BARTONE's past record, it is doubtful as to whether
he would furnish accurate information regarding any contact
made with him by A.W, LAPPIN, It is recommended that the
Washington Field Office, in connection with: its proposed -
interview of A, W, LAPPIN, keep in mind the contact made from his
room at the Leamington Hotel to DOMINICK BARTONE's residence

on February 23, 25, and 26, 1963, If LAPPIN will furnish
substantial information regarding this contact, it is recom-
mended that consideration be given to then interviewing
BARTONE, However, until such time as BARTONE is made avail-
able for interview in the case mentioned above (Bufile
29-31889), it is not believed interview with him is desirable.

Information in this report is also set out in
report captioned, "PAUL MAGLOIRE, IS - HAITI,'"' (Miami File
105-7441) (Bufile 105-55981).

FRANK NATHAN has been a subject in the case
entitled, "ABRAHAM TEITELBAUM, was.; ET AL, PERJURY - BRIBERY,"
(Miami File 74-48) (Bufile 74-1459). There appears to be. no.
objection to direct interview with FRANK NATHAN in this matter,
