who talked with Allan Krebs, an American leftist who is erica
the Free University in New York City: and who is close to Russell

US and London to consult with Ralph Schoenman, Director of the Bertrant-*
Russell Peace Foundation (BRPF) regarding the Foundation's activities. +
There are now only three officials in the BRPF. Stetler is undecided ie ‘
‘about his political future and is considering the possibility of /
returning to graduate school. Schoenman does not have inexhaustable +t
BRPF funds at his disposal and sometimes there are great financial [a#&
crises. At times Stetler is very bitter about Schoenman's methods of”
operation and often feels that the latter “sells dow the river those
