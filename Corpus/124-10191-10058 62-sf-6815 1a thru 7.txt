Enclosed for San Francisco is one copy of page and
3 of a newspaper known as "The Daily Californian" dated 2/20/74
at Berkeley, California. SR BWES, WOKS

For information of San Francisco, thé HOUGHTON
family of Corning, New York are a prominent and wealthy family
who have controlled the Corning Glass Works (CGW), Corning,
New York for many years. They have been concerned about the
wave of extortions and kidnapings that have occurred in the
recent past and have thus been alert to what they consider
unusual incidents.

On 7/11/74, ROLAND L. LOOMIS, Manager of Corporate
Security, CGW, Corning, New York, advised that on 7/9/74,
Mrs. JAMES R. (MAY) HOUGHTON, wife of the vice Chairman of
the Board of Directors, CGW, was home alone at her isolated
home known as The Field, Spencer Hill Road, RD #2, Corning,
New York. At about 4:15 P. M., a man came to her door and
gave her a copy of "The Daily Californian" dated 2/20/74 at
Berkeley, California, which contained an article by MITCH
CLOFF, Staff Writer, and which concerned one ROBERT LEE LEWIS.
The person identified himself to Mrs. HOUGHTON as ROBERT LEE
LEWIS. LEWIS asked Mrs. HOUGHTON where her husband was as
LEWIS wished to discuss the ROBERT KENNEDY killing with him.
She informed LEWIS that her husband was not at home and
about this time, a handyman arrived and LEWIS hurrie left

in what the handyman described as a light colored Datsun,
bearing a white and green license plate, number unknown,
which he believed was a Kansas License.

LOOMIS advised that a check with the secretary of
JAMES HOUGHTON indicated no one had attempted to contact
HOUGHTON through his office and it seems unusual that subject
would attempt to contact HOUGHTON, at the time indicated,
at his home rather than at his office.

MISCELLANEOUS » INFORMATION CONCERNING

Enclosed for San Francisco is one copy of page and
3 of a newspaper known as “The Daily Californian” dated 2/20/74
at Berkeley, California.

For information of San Francisco, the HOUGHTON
family of Corning, New York are a prominent and wealthy family
who have controlled the Corning Glass Works (CGW), Corning,
New York for many years, They have been concerned about the
wave of extortions and kidnapings that have occurred in the
recent past and have thus been alert to what they consider
unusual incidents.

On 7/11/74, ROLAND L. LOOMIS, Manager of Soxporate
Security, CGW, Corning, New York, advised that on 7/9/74,
Mrs. JAMES R. (MAY) HOUGHTON, wife of the vice Chairman of
the Board of Directors, CGW, was home alone at her isolated
home known as The Field, Spencer Hill Read, RD #2, Corning,
New York. At about 4:15 P, Me, @ man came to her door
gave her a copy of “The Daily Californian” dated 2/20/74 at
tkeley, California, which contained an article by MITCH
CLOFF, Staff Writer, and which concerned one ROBERT LEE LEWIS.
The person identified himself to Mrs. HOUGHTON as ROBERT LEE
LEWIS. LEWIS asked Mrs. HOUGHTON where her husband was as
LEWIS wished to discuss the ROBERT KENNEDY killing with him.
She informed LEWIS that her husband was not vat home! an

in what the handyman described as a light colored Datsun,
bearing a white and green license plate, number unknown,
which he believed was a Kansas license.

LOOMIS advised that a check with the secretary of
JAMES HOUGHTON indicated no one had attempted to contact
HOUGHTON through his office and it seems unusual that subject
would attempt to contact HOUGHTON, at the time indicated,
at his home rather than at his office.
