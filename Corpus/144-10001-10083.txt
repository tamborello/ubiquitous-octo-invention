SEES AT am ORTENTE PROVINCE BELIEVED TO BE: TERMINATED

The alert in Oriente Province (see 2/0[—]R196+63) is be-
lieved to be terminated. The alert, apparently prompted by.
President KENNEDY‘s death on 22 November, was possibly pre-
scheduled to:terminate on 25 November. There have been two orders
which suggest that the alert was destined to be concluded on
25 November; they are: ‘

 

1) Access to the Coastal Observation Post at Punta °
Maisi (20-15N 74-09W) was restricted until 25 November: because
of the alert (see 219s{__yRo67- 63); and

2) Subordinates ae Banes, Headquarters : ‘Eastém Naval
District, were to receive further orders on the 25th, | “presumably
concerning their alert status. (2/0__f196- 63)5 no such orders
have been noted in communications.

There have been no further “references in intercepted commini--
cations to the alert since 02222 on 23 November (279s ___1R667- -63).

It is possible that the restritted agcess: to the Observation
Post ‘at Punta Maisi extends to other Observation Posts: -in Oriente
Province ‘such as reported on 23 November when First‘ Arey Coastal.
Observation Posts were placed in an alert status ‘
(2/LRL[___/R188- 63), and that the vestrtetion, was to, bé: Lifted on
25 November by all those posts.

Further indieation that the alert hae” remained ig the fact
that the Cuban Navy was engaged in an island-wide communications
exercise on 25 November.. It is considered unlikely that ‘Bele an
exercise would be conducted. under alert conditions.

There have been no further “references to the alert ' ‘status
of the (D percent Santiago de Cuba) ‘units which was’ first ob-
served on 23 November (2/sL.[— )R05~ 63) x. All CRAF’ cand ‘Soviet
Forces’Cuba communications appear*to, he normal during, titis
period, 22-26 November 1963. : .
