' This reports: plar’ ‘of four New. England
hoodiunms to*kill two Agénts of our Boston

‘office. Three of these hoodlums are currently

fugitives in connection with the ITAR-Gambling
investigation. The fourth was arrested by our
Boston office yesterday and is being held on
$150,000 bond. All four have been implicated |
in the gangland slaying of Rudy Marfeo, Boston,

. Massachusetts, bookmaker. According to a —

former informant of our Boston office, the
plans call for his urging our two Agents to
contact him, after which the hoodlums would
take the Agents under control. One Agent
would be killed immediately. SA Paul_Rico
_$would_then—be-forced_to drive the _hoodlums
to the place where John J. Kelley was being
guarded-by-U. S. Marshals. Kelley is current-)
*|ly cooperating- with our-Boston Office_and has
|provided detailed information implicating
these hoodlums in’ the murder of. Marfeo.

_ | The hoodlums believed that the marshals, i
sti seeing Agent Rico, would relax, after
|: they would kill Agent Rico, the marshals
and Kelley. The hoodiums indicated that if
they locate SA Rico's exact address, they have!
other plans in mind which were not furnished ~
our source. :

‘The Lerner ‘mentioned in this teletype
when apprehended by our Boston office yester-'
day, commented to Agent Rico "You look just
like your pictures." Lerner, according to 4
Kelley, is extremely courageous and appears to
relish killing. i

A teletype is being sent immediately to
ISAC, Boston, containing specific instructions |
to afford SA Rico and his family adequate ~.
security; to vigorously press their investi-
