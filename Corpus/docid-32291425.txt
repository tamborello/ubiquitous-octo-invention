stated he had been in Miami during this time but refused to
furnish any information concerning his activities there. He
. was questioned concerning telephone calls received at his_
telephone number. from a known South Carolina gambler, PAUL _
‘XK paowas Cou 165-68), and he admitted that such a call had

“been ‘received but the call had been placed by’ THOMAS to: a

friend of OWENS from Miami. who was in Dallas at .the time.

DAVIS denied any interstate communications, for gambling: \
purposes or any interstate travel. for same.. He refused

to discuss his wagering activity. . He was questioned con-
-cerning his gambling debt of an alleged amount of .$18;000
owed by him. to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, gambler - FRAN! Cr

(DL 165-118); DAVIS would only comment that he had‘taken
care of the matter.and that he had lost the money. in-a poker.
game in which VUCI was supposed. to have: been his partner.

He stated that although. the stories around town’ had stated
the amount was $18,000, it was actually $5,000.: OWENS: made
a comment to the Bureau Agents which possibly reflects the :
attitude of numerous Dallas gamblers, to wit, “Are you guys

bothering the other. gamblers as much as you are bothering
me?", He then went on to explain that anyone connected with ,
gambling in. Dallas is quite upset over the intensified |
efforts. of the. FBI and IRS in checking all gambling ‘activities '
in Dallas.:- i

of marked playing cards and loaded dice which had been found .
in his apartment recently by Dallas police officers,: He
claimed he had purchased these several years ago from a
company in Chicago and had used them to "cheat suckers" in
poker games in the Dallas area two or three years ago. He
claimed that after he had made some money through these {
efforts he suddenly decided to quit because he'was afraid

if he continued he might get into trouble with some other |
gambler who would discover his activities, appeared i
to be cordial and cooperative and further contacts. with him i
will be conducted by the Dallas Office in an effort to develop ;
him as an informant or source of information. ‘He is an |

A review of the Dallas Interview Brogram to date
‘reflects that in many instances pertinent information has \
been obtained and several potentially good sources have “4
been developed. It has also been noted that the Program '
-has created an uneasy atmosphere among the gambling element '
in the Dallas area. This discreet pressure along with :
intensified investigation will be maintained by the. Dallas :
