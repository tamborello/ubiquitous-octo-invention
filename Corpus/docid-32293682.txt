In connection with the subject's attendance.

at the 10/14/60 party, attention is called to the fact
that NY does not plan at this time to open a case on —
ALEXANDER KUTILIN. KUTILIN advised that he doubted if
either! MISHUKOV or BUKATIY]were interested in him, Hi S)
apparefitly based this be f on the fact that they didnot
solicit his address and telephone number during the party
end further on the fact that they are well aware of his
