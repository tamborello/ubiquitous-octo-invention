2, Station is aware that although LEAL'’s contacts make him
& possibly interesting target, he will be a difficult and wary
one, However, we are encouraged that we are right on target
in trying to get closer to him by LNYAPA's confirmation of his
associates and their obvious connection with drug trafficking.
