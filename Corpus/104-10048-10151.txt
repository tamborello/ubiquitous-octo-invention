Frank Fiorini. on.28 May was consi idered possibly oftinterest to

. Headquarters, but. probably best not forwarded in reports Format.
Fiorini said that:he. had. spoken twice during the month with
General Claré Chenault, Jr., who phoned from California.
Chenault indicated his desire to participate in the anti-
Castro effort, and asked Fiorini about the different organ-

- izations in the Miami-area and their leaders. Fiorini's
reply. put Manuel Artime at the head of the list, and noted :
that lack of. financial backing was Artime's most pressing
problem. In. the. second phone call, Chenault recommended that
Artime solicit aid from the representatives of the Chinese
Nationalists: in Washington, and urged that his (Chenault's)
name be used. Fiorini promised to pass this on to Artime
when the latter returned to the U.S. from a tour of Latin
American countries.
