Further identified by Marina OSWALD
as Tamara Nikolayevna TADEUSH, Below
morskaya 174 "A", Apt. 2, Leningrad..
Marina described Tamara as a friend
who worked with her in the same
hospital. According to Marina,
Tamara worked as a gynecologist.

statements, the only hospital in
which she had worked was in Minsk.

and it appears that the address
would be plausible for either city.
The small g. before Minsk in the

(spelled with a double S). L..G.
PRUSSAKOVA, which is one of only
three possible variations of the
name PRUSAKOV listed among the more
than 70,000 names in the 1961 Lenin-
grad Telephone Directory, is men-
tioned here only because of the re-
lationship of the name to the

Konstruktorskoye Byuro (The BSSR

to. the patronymic of Robert Alek=-
