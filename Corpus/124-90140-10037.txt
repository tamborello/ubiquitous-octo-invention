We had no information to furnish CIA upon receipt of
their request and initiatéd inquiry to identify subject, Inasmuch
ag we have now developed background data concerning him we are —
furnishing same to CIA for passage to their sources. Also since
: we are requesting ‘them to furnish us with any additional data they

material to their sources rather than Legat. In this manner
we will be assured that the source who is apparently in a position
‘to lmow of subject's association with “Pregon" will have the resuits
of our inquiry. Legat, however, should ani is being alerted to in~ -
stant matter. Evaluation memorandum is not being disseminated with
