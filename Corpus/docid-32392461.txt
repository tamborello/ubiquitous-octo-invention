2. V. I. IVANOV, in my opinion, would be described as a health-physicist with
particular interest in neutron dosimetry. He appeared to be quite competent in
his fiela. At the completion of a presentation which I made, Ivan.v asked if I
nac indeed used a pulse-type reactor without a moderator as my neutron environ

astounded. Ivanov was a man of small stature, slender (1,0 lbs.), black hair,

"3, _YU. I. MOSKALEV would be described as a radiation biologist. He appeared
to Rave a broad background in biology with lesser emphasin on physics. He was

of medium stature, 175-185 lbs., and! probably in his early. pons As best I
coflTH"astethine, he neither spoke nor Wnderstood English. He, too, dressed in

_ typical Russian style. (S)-

      
   
   
    

‘ he Both of these Soviets impressed me as being very competent scientists.
The work they presented was not anything new, but they were very well versed
on its content. They answered questions graciously and fully and did not make
an attempt to avoid questions on their work. They were very alert during the
various sessions, took a copious amount of notes and asked questions of many
of the contributors: (c) ; ;

    
   
     
   
   
    

S. From the work which the Soviets presented, it appeared that they were not

4{nvolved in basic “ivory tower" type research, but rather in what we would call
applied research. From the number of co-authors which appeared on their papers
one would tend to think that a rather large effort was being made in this field.

6. Repeatedly, the Soviets asked questions about the effects and measurement
of intermediate-range (epi-thermal) neutrons (which have energies in the ran?

intermediate range neutrons than did their U.S. counterparts. (S) :

  
    
      
     
      
   
     
      
  

7. [heard through unofficial channels that the ACC was going to invite both

meetings sometime within the near future. I believe this would be an excellent
chance for ‘exploitation due to their willingness to discuss work in their
