RE: JOSE ENRIQUE ALEMANY; CARLOS RICARDO SOLOMON '

Te nae

|

president took office. In la te 1960" : and early 1961, SOLOMON
was seen by another Cuban stadt: jident, tfied, passing out
literature and pamphlets published/ by yariths departments of
the”Cuban government to Latin American students on the LSU campus,
including Cuban students. SOLOMON speaks favorably of CASTRO.
ISASI knew of no information that SOLOMON is a communist or
communist ‘sympathizer.

In conclusion, ISASI advised that there is literature
such as pamphlets being received on the LSU campus, apparently
by the pro-Castro Cuban students, which they occasionally dis-
tribute. This literature is published in Spanish in Cuba by the |
‘present Cuban government.

[on February 20. 1961, and April 18, 1961, NO 1084-8, (/(L)

who is familtar with some phases of Communist Party and related
activities in the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, area, advised that the
above-mentioned Cuban students at LSU (referred to by ISASI) are '
unknown to him and he has no information concerning them. .

In view of the allegations re both subjects SOLOMON
and ALEMANY indicating they were active in passing out literature
_published by the Cuban government, New Orleans,has opened separate
cases on these subjects to determine extent of their activities
and whether or not their actions place them within purview of
Foreign Agents Registration Act.
