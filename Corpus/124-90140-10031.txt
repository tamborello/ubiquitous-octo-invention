Subject studied Russian an ttiel pastors wl European languages. While in

Finland, he also taught English. Source did not know what income Subject
had, but wondered how he could manage to make enough money from teaching
English to be able to afford a room costing $0.00 per month, a telephone

and riding lessons, plus the usual normal living expensess —
be DE CASTRO returned to Sweden, penniless, in about 1958 Ona

visit to Helsinki later that year he stated that he had not been able to

find a job in Sweden, During the course of his entire stay in Finland

for about seven years, he gave no indication why he was remaining there
for that length of time and he did not advance himself in any discernible
way, He never visited his mother in England, although he did receive a

visit from his aunt, who is also an Englishwoman.

CG, Subject never expressed any political opinions, but his entire

behavior aroused unfavorable speculation as to why he was in Finland,

de In the summer of 1958 DE CASTRO was hired by Pan American World

Airways to work at the Helsinki Airport, but he was discharged for in-
competence. Subject also was given a job teaching English for the
Tampere (a city in Finland) Finnish-American Society, but lost this
position, too, because of incompetence. .

    
 

So Please advi he information in paragraph 3 above may be
furnished to} mich is interested in Subject. We would
also 2 2 e whether you have received a separate inquiry
from intthis matter.
