CURRENT POLITICAL RELIEFS:

Until 1961-62 Subject showed a pronounced anti-US and. pro-
Communist, pro-Castro bias. More recently, however, there hac been
information indicating that he does not bold to his former views and - oo.
is thinking of leaving Cuba, The progression of his political © | . wi E
thinking is visible in the following extracts. ~ : ,
2

 

1959: A US resident of Cuba whose source was a Cuban youth .
leader reported that the swing to the left of the University Students
Federation (Federacidn. Estudiantil Oniversitaria - FEU) was confirmed
by the décision made at the end of November 1959 to become a full
member of the Communist-run International Union of Studente (rus).
(However » the FEU ulso retained ‘its association with the Coordinating ie |
Secretariat, of the National Union of Students - cosec.} . :

Editorial Note: Since this swing to the left of the FEU happened . a
only 6 month or so after Subject became president of that organization
it does not, seem likely that he could have so quickly influenced the .
predominantly Catholic university. On the other hand » one of the FEU ~ ot
vice presidents, José VENEGAS Valdespino, vas by November headirg . :
the Latin American Department of the FEU, an indication that the FEU i
was organizing its area departments along the exact lines of the area { '
}

 

departments in the Cuban Ministry of State (Foreign Ministry?).

1959-60: Subject and other FEU leaders entertained a group of i

Red Chinese students in Havana, : i

 

March 1960: An anti-Communist student.leader said that Subject .
was neither pro- nor anti-Communist. The source felt that Subject's t :
only desire was to prevent discord during his term’of, office as FEU $
president. : :

March 1960: In late March a Mixed Commission at the University’ _ i
of Havana met to discuss’ the establishment of Disciplinary Tribunals, .

 

objected, saying the old disciplinary councils had been suspended co
becduse more modern and efficient legislation was being studied by bo.
the commission and it was only logical to wait until this legislation pO :
was promulgated before establishing new tribunals. AL the arguments i :
had no effect on Subject and Angel QUEVEDO Valdivia. Subject said he :

had never seen so many Catholics and anti-Communists present on campus
“attempting to deny the existence of fréedon of speech and written
expression." He added that, "everyone knows that no one is tore opposed
