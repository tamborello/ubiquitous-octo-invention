LA 92-113

On November 18, 1959, LA T-3 made available records
of the Ahmanson Bank and Trust Company, 9145 Wilshire Boulevard,
Los Angeles, which reflect that the Cantillon and Cantillon ’
trustee account has a current balance of $4.31. There was a
deposit on September 21, 1959, of $43.12. On September 23, 1959,
; a check for $107.75 was drawn, and there have been no entries
, since that date.

i As will be set out later, on October 16, 1959, ROSSELLI :
issued a check in the amount of $1,500. payable to JAMES P.
CANTILLON, Trustee, which check was deposited at Bank #16-20,
which is the Main Office of the Califormia Bank in Los Angeles.

 

Lucey's New Orleans House
5444 Melrose Avenue

Los Angeles, California °

On August 13, 1959, LA T-2 furnished information that i
MONTE PROSER and MARSHALL EDSON were opening Lucey's Restaurant ~~
in the Hollywood area and that everyone was aware that PROSER
does not have sufficient money of his own to engage in this type
of operation. Informant said that it was rumored that $200, 000.
would be spent getting the business in operation. Informant
offered the opinion that ROSSELLI might be furnishing some of the
money to PROSER; however, informant had no facts upon which to
base such an opinion. -He said that he contacted PROSER, and
PROSER: promised to buy ice making machines from the informant.

On September 17, 1959, LA T-2 advised that ROSSELLI
was in Los Angeles on Monday, September 14, 1959, and he and
ROSSELLI had dinner together at Lucey's Restaurant. LA T-2
said that through ROSSELLI's friendship with MONTE PROSER
and informant's association with ROSSELLI he, the informant,
was able to sell two 400 pound ice making machines to Lucey's
Restaurant. Informant said that in the installation of the two
machines he was having some difficulty with MARSHALL EDSON
as to some minor detail of the installation. The following day
EDSON remarked.to informant that ROSSELLI had told EDSON that he,
ROSSELLI, had told the informant to handle the installation
in a certain manner, and therefore EDSON was not to interfere
with the installation. This incident indicated to informant
that ROSSELLI might possibly have an interest in Lucey's.
