Re Bureau letter to Charlotte 7/18/68 enclosing a
CID investigative report. .

The CID report was reviewed and, based on the infor-
mation contained therein, it is apparent the information
provided by CE 2243-C was valuable to CID in their investigation.
The CID investigation is closed with one conviction, a fine, and _
a recovery of $27,578.35. The amount stolen from the U. S. Le

Government could not be determined. _ ¢

Since the information furnished by the FBI from the
informant is not reflected in detail in the report, its value
cannot be precisely determined; however, it can be assumed that
informant's information was extremely valuable since it was both
timely and accurate and identified at least two of the subjects
and the base of operation of the illegal activity.

ya

On 8/12/68, CE 2243-C was recontacted concerning this
matter, and he advised he could not provide any additional
pertinent information concerning it. :

In view of the fact this illegal activity took place
outside the U.S. and the matter has been resolved by CID, this
case is being placed in a closed status as no additional infor-

mation can be obtained. .
