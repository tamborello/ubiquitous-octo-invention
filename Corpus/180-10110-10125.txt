_ INTERVIEW OF DAN NEISCUIR

. Dan Neiscuir was interviewed at CIA Headquarters on 8/29/78 ‘at 10:00
A.M. by HSCA researchers Dan Hardway and Charles Burke. Mr. Neiscuir was
. shown the omnibus release letter and stated that he understood it.

Mr. Neiscuir stated that he is currently assigned to the CIS. He is ..
the Chief of the Operations Coordination Branch/East Asia and Africa. Mr.
Neiscuir said that Joseph Piccolo was his deputy in the above mentioned
branch.

Mr. Neiscuir stated that he had never been involved in any of the
CIA's "in-house" investigations of the Kennedy assassination or Oswald.

He did state, though, that he had once worked on an "Oswald Task Force.”

He said that this occurred in late September or October of 1975. At that
time there were 2 or. 3 FOIA suits brought against the Agency concerning:
the Agency's files on Oswald. These files had to be processed and the
task was delegated to the C/CIS and he was assigned to the task force.

Mr. Neiscuir stated that he was also one of the primary contacts with

2 investigators from the Senate Select Committee.which was looking into
the Agency's files on Oswald at approximately. the same time. He compared
his role in this regard to that of Russ Holmes vis a vis thé:HSCA. The
task force that he was part of conducted no.research and analysis that

‘he was aware of. Mr. Neiscuir stated that the only photograph that he
remembers seeing is the Mexico Mystery Man photo. He said that he did

not recognize the name "Charlotte Bustos." He stated that he does not
recall ever being told that there was a photo of Oswald from the surveillance
operations. He denied ever telling anyone that such a photo: was found.

He did admit, however, to discussing the assassination with Joseph Piccolo.

Mr. Neiscuir stated that other people who had worked on the task
force had been: Robert Wall, Bill Perkins, Len Brea,

Tony Sileo, and Paul Hartman.

Mr. Neiscuir stated that he believed that Silvia Duran had been an
Agency source. He was. not.sure why he had this recollection but stated that
it was something from Oswald's file; he could-not remember anything specific
that was the basis for this. He said that it was possibly because of the heavy
traffic after the assassination trying to. protect her. This leads him to think
that she was either as source or of interest to either the Station or the
Mexicans.
