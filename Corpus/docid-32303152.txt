able newspaper publicity, tha Co realized that the
weapons had been stolen from a National Guard Armory in
Canton, Ohio. [___]later learned from a source he could not.
recall that the burglary of the armory was committed by

GEORGE FLOREA and RICHARD STEWART, with help from a "inside :
man," and that the guns had been stored in the beer distribu-
torship owned by VIC CARLUCCI in Arnold, Pa. RED GIORDANO,
who was convicted in this case merely because it was proven

he had bought some burlap bags and the weapons, when found,
had been wrapped in burlap bags, actually had nothing to do
with the case. ANDY MANGINI, who was never prought into the
case, actually helped load and unload the guns from CARLUCCI's

‘ peer distributorship to the truck and from the truck to the

airplane. _ :

Lottery

HYMEN MARTIN, aka, PITTSBURGH HYMIE, used to have the distributor-

ship in Western Pennsylvania of the Empire Treasury lottey
tickets, and since he was friendly with the. MANNARINOS, they
allowed his ticket to be sold at their numbers outlets in and
hear New Kensington, Pa. HYMIE MARTIN, with whom[ ]became
friendly when [J was a used car.salesman in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
was the one who first introduced[__] to the MANNARINOs, in
approximately 1954. MARTIN, who now resides in Miami, Florida,
probably turned over the distributorship of the Empire Treasury
lottery ticket to his brother, NATE MARTIN, who is still in

the Pittsburgh area. .

Recently, "the outfit" has come out with the Pan American
Sweepstakes ticket, which is based on the running of the Dixie
Handicap horse race at Pimlico Track, Maryland, in the near
future. "The outfit" compelled KELLY MANNARINO to take 10,000
books of these sweepstakes tickets, which he must dispose . .
of in his area of Western Pennsylvania. One of KELLY MANNARINO'S
employees, known as "SHRIGGS ," undoubtedly will handle the ;
delivery of the sweepstakes tickets, as he currently does with

_the Empire Treasury lottery tickets.

‘Gambling Casino
The MANNARINO gambling casino in New Kensington, Pa., operates

seven nights a week. They are well patronized at this joint,
and they even send "luggers" to the Squirrel Hill section of

Pittsburgh, which means that gamblers in Squirrel Hill are
transported from that section to New Kensington for the pur-
pose of gambling. Routine employees at the gambling casino
receive $150 per week flat, and those in charge receive the
$150 weekly salary plus a small percentage of the net take.

It has been curious in the past to note that whenever they so
desire, KELLY MANNARINO or SAM MANNARINO would walk into the
gambling casino and demand that the cashier give them a sum
of money. For instance, SAM MANNARINO might tell the cashier
to give him $1,000 and not to tell KELLY MANNARINO at the

risk of being killed. Employees at the casino do not carry
weapons generally, but am:.occasions, when there is a rumor that
the casino may be robbed, everybody, including the MANNARINOs,
goes about town fully armed.

 

Prostitution and Narcotics

Neither KELLY nor SAM MANNARINO has ever been known to traffic
: in narcotics or to operate. prostitution.

. Hideouts

During the long period of time, in excess of one year, that

KELLY MANNARINO was hiding to avoid service of subpoenas, .

commencing in December of 1957, he stayed at two places:.

the house of "SARGE" BOTTI, in Wilmerding, Pa., and the house
-. of FRANK D, "SONNY" AMATO, the brother-in-law of KELLY ;
: MANNARINO, who :.resides...:: in East McKeesport, Pa. ;

 

 

During the, period in 1958 when SAM MANNARINO was avoiding’...
service of subpoena, he stayed, at least part of the time,

at the parish house of Mount Saint Peters Roman Catholic
Church, New Kensington, Pa.

Gun-running

Although the Federal Government was not able to prove it, . , fod
there is no question that SAMUEL: MANNARINO was part of the . : a
conspiracy in 1958 to run guns from New Kensington, Pa., to cs |
Cuba. =

Originally the’ plans to take guns to Cuba were [VT ]
plans and the guns were scheduled_to go to FIDEL CASTRO. In
the summer of. 1958, AL ROSS told that he could obtain
M-l rifles and carbines. met ROSS at the Warwick Hotel,
New York City, and gave ROSS $4,000 as part payment for the
uns, which money [[___] had received from CARLOS PRIO..

was to return to the Warwick Hotel with additional
Money in a day-or so and did so, but AL ROSS did not show up. -
After L_____] returned to Miami, Florida, [___] learned from
Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO, Miami Springs, Florida, at SAM MANNARINO
was interested in purchasing an Apache airplane, Because

is a pilot and acquainted with airplaneg, he looked
over the prospective plane with Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO and
advised Dr. PESSOLANO that the airplane was too defective.
After that,[_____] assisted Dr. PESSOLANO to lease a Twin Ss

- Beech airplane from a company owned by HAL DUPONT, Miami, OTHER 4

- Florida. When Dr. PESSOLANO tola J that MANNARINO intended :
to use the airplane to fly guns to Cuban dictator BATISTA, he
realized that these were the guns that had been promised to
him and that he was being double-crossed. poe then abranged
with Dr. PESSOLANO for[-_____] to accompany the pilot, STUART

. SUTOR, on the first flight to Pittsburgh, for the sole purpose
of contacting SAM MANNARINO and asking him about the double-
cross. After SUTOR and | panded at Allegeny Airport,
Pittsburgh, they took a ca () sister's house in the
Regent Square section of Pittsburgh and borrowed her car.

_ They drove to the Tour-Tel Motel on U, S. Route 22, Monroeville,
where they registered for the night. — and SUTOR then
traveled to New Kensington, where attempted to locate
SAM MANNARINO. po iwas unable Leos Ocate SAM MANNARINO, so
he went to Wilmerding, Pa., to the house of "Sarge" BOTTI,’
where KELLY MANNARINO was hiding from the service of subpoenas.

_KELLY MANNARINO stated that he knew nothing of the plan to
smuggle guns to Cuba, that this was one of SAM ; MANNARINO'S
"hare-brained" schemes, and that he wanted nothing to do with
it. then returned to Miami, Florida, by way of Eastern
Airlines. It was not until the pilot, STUART SUTOR, was ;

phases of the MANNARINO-contrelied slot and pinball machines.
NORMAN ROTHMAN

NORMAN -ROTHMAN has represented the MANNARINOs in their Cuban
and some Florida interests for many years. ROTHMAN, like.all
other MANNARINO employees, steals from them, and when the
MANNARINOs have lost money in an investment, such as the Sans
Souci Gambling Casino, Havana, Cuba, which ROTHMAN fronted for
them, ROTHMAN always emerges with money. ROTHMAN's Cuban
connections are over-rated and when anything actually difficult
is to be accomplished in Cuba, ROTHMAN ordinarily needs the
assistance of Currently, ROTHMAN has the
franchise for the cocktail bar in the Bel Aire Hotel, Miami (
Beach, Florida, and his two sons are working at the bar. ROTH-
MAN is, like SAM MANNARINO, an addict to cocaine, which he
sniffs...

ABE SEID, aka, Al Ross

Although AL ROSS has the reputation ~ oo of having killed
on many occasions, it is not believed that he deserves that
reputation. He has never been known to brag about any kill-
ings. ROSS, who is under order of deportation to his native
Russia, is worried that the U. S. Government will find some
nation which will accept him. ROSS is very much in love with
his wife, MORMA, who is a nymphomaniac currently residing on
Palm Island, Miami Beach, Florida. ROSS gives the appearance
of being a "tired old man," and he shows no enthusiasm for
taking part‘in any illegal activity to obtain money, even
though he is in serious financial straits.

JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA

JOHN FONTANA was once KELLY MANNARINO's bodyguard and most
trusted lieutenant. KELLY MANNARINO regarded FONTANA as his

‘protege and made hima "don," After FONTANA's marriage ahout

a year and a half ago, he and MANNARINO had a falling out.
FONTANA thought that he was not getting enough money and

complained to MANNARINO, who told him that he was getting all

he was going to get. FONTANA then made the serious mistake:
of going over KHLY MANNARINO's head and appealing to JOHN

LA ROCCA, who subsequently reported this to KELLY MANNARINO,
Since then FONTANA has been relegated to an unimportant. job
fronting the Marbet Heating Company store in New Kensington,
and he receives little or no income from the MANNARINO gantling

activities.
