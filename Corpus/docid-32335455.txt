On February 13, 1973, SA ANDREW J, HOFFMAN,
Intelligence Unit, ‘Customs Agency Service, Bureau of
Customs, Miami, advised that during the past several
years, STELZ has furnished information to Customs
concerning matters within their jurisdiction. While
this information as furnished was plausible, none of
it ever developed into anything prosecutable. HOFFMAN
has had no dontact with STELZ in about a year. HOFFMAN
said that STELZ could be described as a source of
information for Customs, but no continuous contact is
made with him, and past contact was not sufficient to
make a judgment as to whether STELZ can be considered

-reliable. In fact, HOFFMAN regarded STELZ as somewhat
of a "wheeler-dealer.". t

SA CHARLES LUTZ of the Customs Agency Service
also advised that the Buffalo Office of Customs, ig
investigating the possible illegal shipment of arms
by the Bonray Financial Corporation, Ltd., 80 Richmond
Street West, Toronto, Canada, and this company has
been in contact with STELZ within the past year. LUTZ
requested that a copy of the FBI investigation of
STELZ be made available to Customs.
