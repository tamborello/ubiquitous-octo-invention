Director Woolsey:

We are writing to express our sincere appreciation and recognition of the
excellent support that has been provided to the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence by a member of your agency.

From October 1993 through August 1994, Mr. Paul Levesque has assisted
Committee staff in the review process required for release of the John F.
Kennedy Records Collection. The project involved reading and evaluating
thousands of classified records that were in the possession of this Committee,
and approving them for release pursuant to Public Law 102-526.

Given the volume of documents stored at the Select Committee, this
was a tremendous administrative task. Mr. Levesque’s expertise,
professionalism, and personal attention to detail were a significant
contribution to our Committee being able to successfully complete this
important task.

Mr. Levesque is clearly a credit to your organization and we appreciate his
hard work and superior performance on behalf of our Committee.

“ Please extend our personal thanks to Mr. Levesque.
