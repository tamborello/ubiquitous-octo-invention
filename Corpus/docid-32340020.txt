of income is the wide-spread concession he has at numerous

race tracks throughout the country, primarily in Florida and
New Jersey but including the Fairgrounds in New Orleans, for the
seat cushions. Informant stated the seats are fixed with a
twenty-five cent slot, which, for that price, will release a
seat cushion, this device being extremely lucrative; and while
McLANEY £8 Hot believed to own the concession, he has control

at some of the main tracks in the comtry.

Informant related that he has not seen McLANEY personally for
a number of years but lst spoke with him some two months ago,
at which time the conversation was by radio-telephone, McLANEY ;
& being at sea in his yacht. McLANEY at that time related the troubl
© he has been having in Cuba and wants desparately to unlead,
# claiming that it is now impossible to do business in Cuba due -
‘® to the many régulations being put put. Informant feels that “
McLANEY is the front man for TOPPING and WEBB and feels that they
have an interest in the entire Hotel Nacional in Havana, not ;
just the gambling concession. He stated that this is the nature
of McLANEYts connections, always with better-class persons,
wealthy and independent of any mob control, and he has never been
known to have been involved in any violence, extortion or
trouble of any kind, although he has always been an inveterate
gambler and bets very heavily on any type of sporting venture.
Informant advised that he knows of only one other member of the
- family, a brother, WILLIAM McLANEY who is supposed to be looking
after the business in Havana, another person who has never had
— any criminal connections that informant knows of. He stated
that McLANEY would be a man of about forty-five yeas of age
at this time, is married to a waalthy girl from Philadelphia
and net known to have any family ties in New Orleans any more.
