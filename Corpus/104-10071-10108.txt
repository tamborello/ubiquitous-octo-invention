Dear John, /

Robert J. and Christine KORENGOLD

 

1. Reference is made to our No. 4138, dated 4 May 1971
and memorandum attached thereto.

2. Additional research reflects that:

 

a. The American journalist "Bud"! KORENGOLD is Robert

James KORENGOLD (dpob: 4 September 1929, Minneapolis,

Minn.). The°marriage did take place in Hoscow, but on
22 August 1962.

‘ '  b. His wife, described as Christine DAVIRON in your
JT/7183, dated 17 February 1971 (Subject: Maurice
DEJEAN), has been documented as Marie Christine KORENGOLD;
she is still a French citizen, having abandoned her
residence in the. USA in 1966. She was horn as Marie
Christine Madeleine Therese DAVIRON (dpob: 23 October
1937, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France), daughter of Raoul
Michel Alfred DAVIRON (born at Agneux (Manche}, France).

 

3. In the event that information should come to notice
tending to link her or her husband to Soviets or to leftist
or so-called "peace" groups, we should appreciate being advised.

 

 

 

Yours,
