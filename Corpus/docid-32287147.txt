Re Phila. letter (FD 142) 10/12/62 and Bureau
letter to Phila. 10/17/62. :

Phila. letter indicates that cost for leased line
to bring source, if same established, into Phila. area would be
approximately $1.00 per air mile and the distance of location of
source (to CP in Phila} is 120 miles.

 

Contact with confidential source at Bell Telephone
Co., Phila., indicates more accurately would be approximately
$3.00 per air mile, which would give end result of monthly cost
of between $350.00 and $400.00 for leased line.

Considering the above expense, plus cost of man-

power to monitor, it is requested that Bureau advise if cost
prohibitive or if Bureau desirous of survey.continuing.
