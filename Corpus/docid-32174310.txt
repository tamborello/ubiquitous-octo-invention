| It is the conclusion of both Irwin and hat Jimmy
| Chagra is truthful when he stated that he was responsible
for the death of Judge Wood; however, Travis Irwin doubts
the truthfulness of Harrelson's statements that Larry
| Culbreath was the "tri man" at the murder of Judge Wood.
Irwin has stated cof ee he knows "everything Larry
Culbreath has done ife," and Irwin stated that
Culbreath has denied any participation in the Wood murder

' ; and Irwin is confident that if in fact he (Culb were

| involved, Irwin would have known of it by now. stated

| that he trusts in‘s statements regarding Culbreath and
Irwin thinks off fas a "god" and "looks_u ;

| and would not wi lo) anything from him. Irwin

| and Culbreath had grown up together in Texas an ave been
friends in excess of twenty years.

| Irwin had also determined from either Jimmy Chagra
| or Culbreath himself that Culbreath was arrested either the
i day after or two days after the Wood murder while Culbreath
was drivi relson's car from San Antonio to Pleasanton,
Texas. id not know the nature of the arrest and only
that it occurred between onio and Pleasanton, Texas.
Irwin has also related to that just prior of
arrival at Leavenworth in June, 1980, Jimmy Chagra ha old
him (Irwin) that Harrelson was "good, real good at doing

his job." Since this statement was related to James in the
context of comments about the murder of Judge Wood, it was
mutually understood by Teed Irwin that Jimmy Chagra's
statement had referenc arrelson's ability to "fill
contracts", e.g. murder for hire.

egard to Jimmy Chagra's solicitation of
to procure six or eight individuals to
smuggle marijuana into the United States, as the
murder of a former witness against Chagra, is firmly
convinced that if he refused to locate the individuals
for either "job" for Jimmy Chagra, Jimmy would reach out
and find someone else to do the work.
