Argentina, and that he still exerts some influence in the
"organization" in the United States. .Subsequently on
1/28/64, a request was made of the Bureau to contact either
INS or the State Department for a visitor's visa for
PINDILLT. . :

. By letter dated. 2/5/64 the Bureau advised that
inasmuch as PINDILLI was deported on two occasions in 1931
and 1947 and has had his application for re-entry rejected
by INS ‘on several occasions subsequent to that time, that
it would appear that he had been away from the United States
for too long a period of time to be in any position to gain
- the full confidence of members of the Cleveland "organization".
The letter indicated that these individuals in control in
Cleveland at present were not in. control when PINDILLI *
was active and. ‘as a result would not confide in him concerning
their activities, or CAVHOMB .

In a subsequent contact with CV 344-0, he:

advised that CICCIO MILANO was in control of the Cleveland
"organization" at the time GUISSEPPI PINDILLI was in the
Cleveland area. He stated he still exerts infltience ,
from Mexico, where he is currently. residing. The ‘Cleveland
- “Norganization", according to the informant, is run by’

ANTHONY (NINO) MILANO, arid he is held in ‘sueh’ high réspect
by members of the “organization” that members addréss :
him as "DONINO" or."GOD". He also pointed out that PINDILLI,
prior to being deported in 1947, was’ in’ constant coritact
throughout the United States with members of the "organization",
and still is to this day through correspondence. ‘Informant |
stated that from the time the PINDILLI family moved to_ .
Warren, Ohio, from Pennsylvania, in about 1933, until”
PINDILLI's departure in 1947, PINDILLI was in an almost”
constant travel status for the "organization" throughout

the United States and informant pointed out that PINDILLI

did still have and did still exert influence. “He again’ ©
cited the example of the incident at Mansfield, Ohio, when”
he himself was in trouble, that all it took was a letter from :
PINDILLI to ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland to get results.

Informant also stated that while he operated a
house of prostitution in Reading, Pa., in 1957 and 1958, he
was contacted by a JAMES AMATO, who resides outside of.
Reading, Pa., in the Shenendoah area, who was aware of
PINDILLI's location in Argentina and who looked up the
informant on the request of PINDILLI. He also stated that
AMATO was high enough in the "organization" and close
enough in the "organization" to the "top" to have attended
the funeral of ALBERT ANASTASIA, who was murdered in New
York City. He was apparently of the same "family".

Reference is made to the report of SA JAMES P,
FLYNN, dated 7/1/63 at New York captioned "LA COSA NOSTRA,
aka., AR - CONSPIRACY", wherein on page 82 one AMANO, FNU,
is mentioned as being a member of the GAMBINO family, of ©
which the deceased ALBERT ANASTASIA was also a member. Page 28
of this same report reflects that ANASTASIA, to protect
CHARLES CAVALLARO, had him transferred to VINCENZO MANGANO's
Borgata. Page 27 of the report reflects that MANGANO and
ANASTASIA had been "consiglieri" in Cleveland’ under CICcro
MILANO. ‘The above is noted as it shows the closeness" ‘
of PINDILLI with the "organization" and to CAVALLARO.

Informant also stated FRANK DE AUGUSTINI, second
in command to ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland, on his last cofitact
with cV 344-c, remarked that the informant looked good for”.
his age, and the informant stated he asked DE AUGUSTINI how .
he knew how old he was, DE AUGUSTINI told informant his:
exact birth date and said,"I know all about you because’ I ~~

- Was with your father when he took your mother", ‘It is to be’
“noted that informant's mother was married to another Italian,

and had a daughter by this marriage and informant's father
wanted her for his. wife and took heryaway from her husband
and daughter and began living common law after.which the
informant and three brothers and a sister were born,
