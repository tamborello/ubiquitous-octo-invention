CE 43~New

United States. Subject ATKINSON, who is in:the Goldsboro, N. C.,
area at the present time, is expected to contact SUTTON in the
near future to ascertain if he has made the purchase of the
identification cards. ATKINSON will take the cards to Bangkok
with him if obtained by SUTTON. SUTTON is expected to take the
cards to Bangkok himself if he cannot obtain them by the time
ATKINSON returns. SUTTON has been advised to stall ATKINSON
when contacted by him. He will tell ATKINSON that he probably
can buy the cards, but not for at least a month. SUTTON has
not made any attempt to make such a purchase. SUTTON is
agreeable to travel and will help the Bureau in any way possible

Charlotte indices are negative for ATKINSON and
JACKSON.

Upon furnishing the attached LHM to military agencies
or other agencies, the Bureau is requested to advise them to
protect the information in the LHM, as to reveal it in total
when interviewing subjects would surely reveal his identity to
those individuals,

7

Charlotte desires to be advised of the results of
information developed by the military in order that the
veracity of the informant will be evaluated and to determine
whether there are any possible prosecuteable violations within
continental jurisdiction.

 

 

_ From the information set forth it appears that most,
; if not all, of the potential illegal operatifns are in Saigon
and Bangkok, Thailand; therefore, appropriate dissemination
of the LHM should be made to agencies having an interest in
these locations.
