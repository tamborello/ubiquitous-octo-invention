that the three Cuban officials died “t the hands of the

assassins connected with Cameron's contacts. :
6, In early.April 1964 Eliseo Gomez Fernandez met

with GOSeagnSpi Bosen' Bosh tagreed to advance $100,000

and Babun and his associates would advance $2,500 for

expenses. Julio Lobo Olavarria, a wealtuy Cuban exile

in New York, subsequently agreed to the terms, provided

that his name was not involved. Accordingly, Babun gave

Cameron $2,500 on 25 April. | Cameron then advised his ~

group, and on 25 April h reported that his group had

already called its man in Cuba and told him to proceed

not hesitate to sink his ship, the M/V CAYMAN HOPE.
