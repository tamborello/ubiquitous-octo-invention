ATIN: FBI LABORATORY, ELECTRONICS SECTION
FROM 9 SAC, PITTSBURGH (92-226-sub 2) .
SUBJECT: SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, aka JUNE
AR .
(00: PITTSBURGH) -
According to criminal informants throughout the ~ @
United States, SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA is the head of
the Pittsburgh family of La Cosa Nostra. An Apalachin
attendee, who escaped the New York State Police dragnet,

 

LA ROCCA maintains a residence at Ingomar, Pa., from
which he directs his Pittsburgh operation and where

| he is contacted by MIKE GENOVESE, who is number-one.
lieutenant in his organization, each weekend for personal
instructions.

  
 

LA ROCCA has been under consideration for technic all
coverage of his-house since December, 1960. Since then it | q
has been deemed almost impossible to effect conventional
misur coverage of his house because he has a.full=time
maid and yardman who both reside - ‘on his premises and
who rarely, if ever, leave the premises. However, in :
January, 1961, Mutt coverage of subject's office in his ‘ 54
‘North Star Cement Block Company, Pittsburgh, Pa., was 4
established but this coverage did not prove productive
and the coverage was discontinued. Due to the national
importance of this subject, it is deemed imperative that
every effort be made to establish technical coverage of
4 subject's residence in spite of the fact that the same
security conditions prevail. In view of this dire need
for coverage, this office is tentatively considering the
technical feasibility /of effecting REMT or Zam coverage.)
