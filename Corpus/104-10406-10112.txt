SU"JECT: Melay in sending the first cable about
OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the delay (by the Mexico
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book as'a
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (wich
in my view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know what he was’ talking about).

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 Oct
convers ation would have been. picked up on the morning-<

  
 
    
  

the photographic coverage. ‘hat coveragi
in the station before the 7th since tha
camera on the 3rd of October and i4\\
the 4th, processed and-pass ed ‘

day vhich would have been Maniax

 

   
  
  

3. Later the film was (eifken out of the camera every day

but at that time, the film stayed in the camera until a full :

roti was completed which might take three or four das. L

4. A name trace could have been requested on the bas is
of the name alone but that wasn't the way Win Scott ran that. _
Station. He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the
teleth one coverage |. .s ometimes._there.was..a U.S. automobile
licens e number. . It was also part of the "numbers game" of
jus tify ing a project ly the number of dis patches, cables or
Teports produced. , Lo
