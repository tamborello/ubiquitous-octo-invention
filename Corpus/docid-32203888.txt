Re: Edward Scammell Butler.

 

     

Cn 26 Oct, 1966, Butler was in Mew York City re: a documentary
film that he has produced about Geztro (comparing him toHitler).
It was shown on a local TV station,

  

Butler claims that the film is based on inside material and

includes Cuban newsreel film that he was able to obtain through

devious means, The production was financed by Patrick J. Frawley,

through Technicolor (?), Butler is working as a consultant for

Frawley and has an office (at Schick Co.?) in Los Angeles -

S567 Comstock Ave, Phone: 271-1295. |
{
i

Butler said that he's trying to get Frawley to consolidate

his anti-communist activities, There was the strong implication
that this might cut into Frawley's support of the American i
Security Council, Butler claims to be very close to Frawley. |

 

In New York, Butler was with Lee Edwards, a public relations
man for Young Ameritans for Freedom and other conservative
causes, talking over possible joint projects in the future,

Butler is the head of the Informatian Council of the Americas
