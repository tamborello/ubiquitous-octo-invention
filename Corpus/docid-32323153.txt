On 8/16/63 SA W. HARLAN BROWN received, in person, a
typewritten report, dated 8/6/63, from DL-6-8, This report has
been serialized as 134-1A-778,

 

' DL-6-8

Informant determined on 8/6/63, that on 8/5/63 JOE LANDIN
attended the Forum's regular meeting. The book, “Among the Valient"
was discussed, Plans were made to give.a couple of these books
to the Dallas Public Library, Library officials told the Forun’
representative that if the Forum wanted to publicize. the event,
they would have to furnish their own photographer., since the
local newspapers do not regard the giving of bosks to the library
as news, The Forum decided to take a photographer to take a
photo or two for the Forum's future publicity. :

Informant further determined that LANDIN told them of
the community~sponsored Stay-in-School campaign initiated by
Mrs, J. E. CRAFT, and of Mrs. CRAFT's request for a donation from
the Forum, The Forum will not send her a contribution, but offered
(after some discussion) to distribute some of the handbills or
placards, When they voted to make that offer, the Chairman said -
derisively: "All those who want to work for the NAACP signify by
Saying 'Aye'." This remark brought laughter from some of the
members, ALBERTO OROSZCO told of a case of racial discrimination
encountered by his insurance collector, The place where he and
his wife had been refused service was the Red Jacket, abar on
Maple. The chairman declined to do something about it since it
was a bar. Another member said it was a private club, Still
another member said he knew the man who ran the place. He was a
former employee at Texas Instruments. The subject was dropped.

Informant had no additional information,
