support this contention, the Captain told Mr. Eden that just
prior to the assassination he was assigned to the Special
Intelligence Command of the Air Force Special Security Office
(AFSSO) at Langley Air Force Base. The Captain continued that
sometime between Sunday and Tuesday, the week of the assassina-
tion, while serving as duty officer, he saw a message which
was intercepted on the Moscow to Mexico City link to be
relayed to Cuba (or Soviet Embassy to Mexico City Embassy to
the Cuban Embassy). The intercepted message specified "some-
thing about Kennedy, Dallas and Oswald" and specified the
"actual date". In addition, the Captain said that soon after
the assassination (time unspecified but probably "days")
another message was received from the Command Center addressed
to all personnel to destroy any and all records pertaining
to the intercepted message, which Mr. Eden felt was highly
irregular. It is believed all of the records were destroyed.
Mr. Eden provided a description of the Captain as
follows:

Male, white, approximately 5'7" or 5'8", about 190
pounds, pudgy build and dark hair.

Mr. Eden could not recall the Captain's name. However, after
further discussion, it was suggested that he attempt to obtain
the name through telephone inquiries at Langley Air Force Base,
since he was known at and discharged from the Base. Mr. Eden
readily agreed and made a number of inquiries by telephone

which culminated in a conversation with Sergeant Leber. The

Sergeant had known and/or worked with the Captain and
indicated that his last name is Stanley. He further stated
that Captain Stanley went to study at Miami University following

his separation from the service.
