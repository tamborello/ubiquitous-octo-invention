Title: JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION
RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992
(THE ACT)

Synopsis: Denver indices searched regarding Judith Campbell
Exner, aka Judith Immoor; Judith Campbell; Judith Eileen Von
Immoor; Judy Campbell; Judy Exner, with negative results.

Enclosures: Enclosed for FBIHQ is the original FD-160 Indices
Search Slip. '

Details: As instructed by FBIHQ EC to All Field Offices and All
Legats, dated 06/19/1997, Denver searched general indices,
confidential indices, Elsur indices, ACS, ISIS, OCIS/CLEA, and
IIS/IIIA, for any files identical to above mentioned individual.

A search of all Denver indices failed to locate any
main files identical to Judith Campbell Exner or any of her
aliases. There is a serial reference in Denver's Bank Fraud
Control File for a Mrs. Judy Campbell; however, a review of the
serial reference determined that this “Judy Campbell” is not
identical to Judith Campbell Exner.

FBIHQ is requested to advise Denver if Headquarters

still needs to have the above mentioned serial reference sent in.
The serial will be sent at that time.
