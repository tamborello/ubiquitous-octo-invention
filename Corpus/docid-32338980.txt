However,-the-sbudio has since decided to shelve the intended motion picture
based on the book although no reason for doing so has been announced publicly,

at the South Hall of the Rnbassy Auditorium, 519 West 9th Ste The title of

_ LAWSON said "We find the dignity of man on trial in Foley Square ‘,

gestapo headed ecadent J. Edgar Hoover, planted papers and seeds of co
dissension in the purse of frail, young Jewish girl named JUDITH COPLON,

This they call the maintenance of the dignity of man. (Applause)

   

'_ (In reference to the persons mentioned in the FBI report at COPLON
trial.) LAWSON said these fine Americans have denied their affiliation with
the CP and guch denials have been necessary as a man cannot be dignified
when he 1s denied the right to work,’ He then spoke on the right of the
individual to education ami gaid that education has been promoted in great
portion by means of the theater and cultural activities, The Planting of
the names of persons active in the cultured mediuns will result in control of
the motion picture industry and those who educate the people will be slandered
so their efforts will not reach in society where needed. This is a capitalistic

gators in the motion picture stry as a threat to those who might endea’ vee
to bring culture to masses of people who attend theaters, They are not’.
satisfied with the results they have now obtained. Wa now see the culture
