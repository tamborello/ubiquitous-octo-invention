VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, AND THE

CUBAN EXILES ALL HAVE REASON TO WISH THE FOUR DEAD AS A MEANS OF
KEEPING THEM QUIET. THE CUBAN OFFICIALS SAID THAT THE CUBAN
GOVERNMENT INTENDED TO KILL THEM, UNLESS ANOTHER GROUP DID IT
FIRST. THE CUBANS SAID THAT NO MATTER WHICH GROUP ACTUALLY
CARRIED. OUT THE ASSASSINATIONS, EVERYONE WOULD BELIEVE THE CUBANS
WERE RESPONSIBLE. THE FOUR MEN, THE CUBANS SAID, MUST PAY FOR
THEIR ACTIONS BECAUSE, SHOULD THEY GO FREE, OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR
GROUPS WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO ATTACK CUBANS ANYWHERE. (FIELD
COMMENT: FOR AN EARLIER REPORT ON CUBA'S INTENTIONS TOWARDS THOSE
IMPLICATED IN THE CUBANA CRASH SEE F522, TDFIRDB-315/10534-76,

 

OF 21 OCTOBER, FROM THE SAME SOURCE. )

4. WHILE THE OFFICIAL CUBAN COMMUNITY IN CARACAS HAS ALWAYS
BEEN CAUTIOUS, SINCE THE CUBANA ATTACK THEIR PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN
INCREASED. THE CUBAN OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE AMBASSADOR, CURRENTLY
CARRY TWO PISTOLS AT ALL TIMES. A LARGE CALIBER PISTOL IS CARRIED
IN MEN'S PURSES, WHICH ARE FASHIONABLE IN CARACAS. A SMALLER
CALIBER PISTOL IS CARRIED IN THEIR BELTS.
