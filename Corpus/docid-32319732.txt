JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION ACT

DECLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS

reseitied Win i bixet

Attached are copies of: DOJ 11/23/93 memo, FBI 11/4/93
memo, your note to Director Freeh dated 12/14/93, and a letter
from Mrs. Morris Childs' attorney dated 12/7/93.

We advised DOJ we intend to release information from
the CPUSA investigation, the two principal SOLO assets and other
assets, and various technical surveillances; and that at least
one document would identify these two SOLO assets. The DOJ
memorandum noted these releases would affect the processing of
all other. CPUSA records in response to FOIA requests; and once
the two SOLO assets are publicly identified they can no longer be
protected as confidential sources in other CPUSA files, although
some of the information may be withheld for other reasons.

DOJ believes it is in the national interest to release
the SOLO story, but since Attorney General Bell decided in 1981
that the SOLO operation should remain classified, Attorney
General Reno's approval is necessary for the proposed
declassification of the SOLO assets. The Attorney General will
be advised of the proposed release of other information set out
in our 11/4/93 memo, and asked to consider whether any change in
classification policy should be publicly announced by her and/or
the Director. DOJ requested assurance that Director Freeh has
been fully briefed on and concurs with the FBI's proposed
release. DOJ will seek AG approval to proceéd. Meanwhile the
FBI is not to release information set out in our 11/4/93 memo.

On 12/27/93 Unit Chief Ron Klein and SSA Carl S..
Valentine met with Gerald Schroeder of DOJ's OIPR to discuss the
status of this matter. We came to three conclusions: 1) that no
information could be released until the AG has decided whether to
declassify information as we suggested; 2)
M Childs: } ade pending AG. deci

    
  
 

  

forma entifying: SOLO
3) that’ the Director be ‘full
Yamifications of our release.

It is:noted that Mr. Gallington mentioned this matter

to the Director at a recent Christmas party.

JOHN.F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION ACT
OF 1992 (THE’ACT); PUBLIC LAW (P.L.) 102-526
" DECLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS |

‘Under the stringent. requirements of P.L. 102-526 we:
have processed documents which are ready for release.

These documents contain information which reveal that’
we had investigations and sensitive coverages of the CPUSA
headquarters, and foreign establishments such as the Tass News
-Agency in New York. and the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D. C.,

- including pre-FISA technical coverage on Tass... °

Other ‘documents indirectly identify our two principal
SOLO assets who acted as liaison and were an integral part of the
funding mechanism between the CPUSA and the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union. Both are deceased, but the widow of SOLO
asset, Morris Childs, requested by attached letter that we not
release any information that. reveals the relationship of herself,
- her husband and brother-in-law with the FBI-until six months
after her death. A.response to ‘the letter is being prepared.
Mrs. Childs is writing a book about the SOLO operation. After :
Morris Childs died, Gus Hall, head of the CPUSA, advised an asset
that he had learned that the FBI attended the funeral services,
therefore, he knew Morris Childs had worked for the FBI.

: - No damage to ongoing operations will result from these
releases. Minimal damage’ is done to national security interests.

; Every effort willbe made to release all information -
that does not harm national security interests. . ae

: _ - AC; Q- {4A 74 0S-_ o

The Attorney General is being’/advised ‘of the above by
the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review because pre-FISA
electronic surveillances were authorized by previous Attorneys
General... These coverages and information. from two of the SOLO
sources have been the subject of Attorney General claims of |
Privilege in past legal actions against the FBI.
