; and in February of '67 he was... 04

. Howard Hunt from “July '62 to August '64 was assigned as a

from the Agency because of his involvement in the assassination

 

plans ‘against Prime Minister Castro. .

~

  

The facts are-that in June 1963 he was assigned ‘

 

reassigned to CIA Headquarters. He retired voluntarily under
our retirement system on 31 of December 1967.

If I may, there is a reason why he was taken out and if I
could go off the record and mention that to the Committee. It
is a matter of his privacy.

Chairman Church. Very well, off the record.

(Off the record discussion)

Mr. Colby. . Back on the record.

Senator Schweiker asked me whether Howard Hunt or James

McCord were in charge of Mexican overations at the time of

President Kennedy's assassination on 22nd of November ‘63.

Section Chief in the Division of Plans Directorates, which is

now the Operations Directorate at CIA Headquarters, which had

.
-

no responsibility whatsoever for Mexican operations.
Senator Schweiker. What were those dates again?
Mr. Colby. July '62 to August ‘64.
Senator Schweiker. Wasn't he at some point in Mexico
City and in charge of that office? |
Mr. Knoche. Way back in the '50's he served in Mexico

‘City. Way back. He was not in-charge.

Senator Schweiker. So that is the period you are Saying

Mr. Colby. No, he was in what we call, and we have since
changed the name, to Domestic Operations Division at that time,
our operations here in this country, and that is a whole
different subject I would have to explain some day.

Mr. McCord from June '62 to June [64 was s assigned asa

CIA Security Officer in

 

and he had no responsibilities for Mexican operations at that
point.
Senator Morgan last time asked what information was given

to the Warren ‘Commission concerning Agency assassination plans

concerning Castro, and I have been advised our records do not

_ indicate that the Warren Commission was provided with infornma-

tion on this subject.

Allen Dulles, of course, I would notes, who was the CIA
birectoz until the fall of '61, was a member of the Warren
Commission, but beyond thet fact I have nothing I could offer.

And then who made the decision net to provide. it, if none
was given? ‘our records do not indicate that there was a CIA
decision on this matter not to tell the Warren Commission.

I could add that I believe the relationship with the
Warson Commission was handled by one ef our staf <a ch

5 Mr. Colby. I have an answer to a few of the questions
6. that were raised at the meeting the other day and there are a
9 couple of clarifications I would like to make

8 One, with’ respect to the security investigations in the
9 United States. The question Was asked whether we ever used
10 private investigators, and I said we normally used our’ own
rr te investigators. We have some relationships with private

12 investigatory firms which provide cover for our investigators
13 and, secondly, we have a few firms which we CWwn which are

14 proprietary: if you will, whereby our investisators appzar to
15 be private. —~

16 I said that in the past it is. clear that on occasion wa
7 dia ask for private investigator firms to help us to some

18 degree, It was usually the one that was giving us cover, and

for reasons of overload we asked them to have thsir own people

20 to do a few of the investigations.

21 My General Counsel says that this is illegal. I have a
22 strong questien about its propriety, if not legality, and I
23 am undertaking to review this matter to see whether we can not
24 just eliminate that practice antirely, continuing the proprie-
25 tary ane continuing the as9 lapel private investigators as cever
