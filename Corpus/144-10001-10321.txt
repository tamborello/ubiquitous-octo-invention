PORTUGUESE REACTION TO DEATH OF PRESEN sete

96: “Nex: 63.

    

PAUSCZTOT(EXONZ)O)
President KENNEDY'’s untimely death was a great shock tg

the Portuguese people and is mourned by all the government and

private citizens alike. The government immediately announced

three days' mourning (the same as for Pope JOHN XXIIZ) and ‘all

flags on government buildings are at half-mast. The press;

has been reporting the event day after day but | so’ ‘far without

editorial comment.

We inquired of the authorities about the effect of KENNEDY's
death on Portugal, and théir view may be. summed: up as being that
the new President will continue KENNEDY' 's foreign policy ‘and
there will be no particular change regarding Portugal and
in particular the Portuguese colonial problem.
