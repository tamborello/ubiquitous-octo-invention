| On 5/3/61, PETER BOMBIK, 1520 Lincoln Ave., New Kensington,
Pa. (protect per request), advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III:

The MANNARINOS have purchased some new property near Camp
Jo-An, Pa., in Westmoreland County. A New Kensington, Pa,,
‘real estate agent, A. F, BOYER, handled the transaction.

On 5/3/61, PG 615-C advised SA FORSYTH:

cottage near Leechburg, Pa., When he wishes to make a
telephone call, he goes down Old Leechburg Road about a

telephone, It is believed, however, that when MANNARINO .
commences permanent summer residence at the cottage, which

ri

ef

is imminent, he will want a telephone installed on the G/
premises, ~ ; ;

Pittsburgh will remain in contact with the local telephone

company official who can advise when a telephone application
is made by MANNARINO:
