2. Agents: This amendment does not change the
agents under this Project.

3. Changes: Since June 1962, the Station has
been considering moving the LIENVOY nter for se~
curity reasons, As the time for thi xican Presi- Zu
dential election] approaches, it may became more dif-
ficult to conce! the activities and location of the
LIENVOY tap center. The present equipment is large
and difficult to conceal, The last LIENVOY Project
renewal request stated that o move was contemplated
1) because of security reasons since the present base
has been used for almost three years; and 2) to pro~
vide the new center with wore mobile equipsent, Dur-
ing the approval process, CI Staff commented that it
concurred with the Station's plan to move. the inter-
cept center for the reasons stated, as the project
activity was bound to become of interest to various
opposition elements and the Station was well advised

.to make necessary changes to provide for and improve
on the security of the operation,

This new cquipment will be placed in a new, more
secure basehouse which is yet to be selected, but
