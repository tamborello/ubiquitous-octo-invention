Cuba and asked MM 492-S what he thought of such a plan.
Informant indicated that he believed such a plan would not
be successful and was probably impossible, pointing out

and merely a number. GUTIERREZ MENOYO had been a traitor
too many times, recalling the "Trinidad Affair" involving
WILLIAM ALEXANDER MORGAN. He explained that too many
people had been killed involving plans connected with
GUTIERREZ MENOYO. He further stated he did not believe
there were many Cubans who would trust MANUEL RAY. Latly,
he stated because of the strict police state which Cuba

is today, individuals inside Cuba are unable to move from
house to house without having a report prepared on their
movements by the Block Defense Committee.

NONNENMACHER asked MM 492-S if he imew whether
many Cubans were l#aving the United States for Latin America
for preparation of an invasion of Cuba, to which the
informant replied negatively. NONNENMACHER indicated many
Cubans were in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua fraining
for a possible future invasion of Cuba.
