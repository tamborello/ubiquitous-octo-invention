’ geed with caution in any discussions with (BLANCO, and not
to acknowledge the fact that he and AMLASH/1 were“in fact

was usually known by his matronymic[Gallerrettaj], is anti-
Communist, friendly to AMLASH/1, a friend of AMLASH/2's

to the point of not willingly compromising AMLASH/1L).
 

 

 

in appreciation
KUBARK business,

  

CeGuel os

of AMWHIP/1 and AMLASH/1, AMWHIP/1 may be allowing
AMLASH/1 the benefit of the doubt in this case.)

AMWHIP/1 stated that he knew all of the people in

‘the letter except Captain (fnu) GIRON. He stated

that it had been quite likely for JINJAUMA to write

to Gallerretta as they had been, as were all the |

others mentioned in ‘the letter, had=teen members of *
the old UIR group which functioned as a counter-
- terrorist element against Batista's first regime circa
‘1944, AMWHIP/1 stated that, in fact, Fidel Castro
himself had been a'member of the UIR. AMWHIP further
stated that there was no doubt in his mind that Fidel,
knowing these men as he did, was well aware of their
antagonism tevards his regime, Other members of the
UER. which AMWHIP/1 could recall were as follows:

Marin DAPEICO Antonio

at
Herminio Biaz | . (friend of APMEGEIRAS) -
Laureano ALVAREZ (presently in N.Y.C., Tel. LUdlow
9-0209)

. rc
Armando CORREA (presently in Miami)
Jesus DIEGUEZ (presently in Miami)
two PARSONS brothers (presently in Miami -
Other data unknown) .

ZARRAGA of course was also a member of the ‘UIR. AMWHIP/1
stated that the most influential members of this group
were or had been JINJAUMA, Fernandez de la CAMARA,
Billiking, and possibly Marin DAPICO, AMWHIP/1 stated
that these people were action types and were reasonably
close@y-knit so far as their loyalty to each other and
in turn the organization was concerned,

e. AMWHIP/1 was also asked to elicit from AMLASH/2
any information which the latter might have concerning
Cuban officials with their hands “in the till" or other-
wise knocking down on the Government, and/or putting money

away in foreign banks,

3. Finances,

AMWHIP/1 was given a token gift of a box of 50 cigars
for the amount of time he freely devotes to
He reluctantly accepted the sum of $500 against

his ops expenses in the past and for the coming trip to Europe,
It was thought, by the way, that a $1000 or more would have been

evntrr
veut
 

a much more cealistic figure to have given him, Howeverg as he

has always dus in the past, he is reluctant to accept money for

his services or for his expenses incurred on KUBARX's behalf.

He did admit, however, that he would probably again be touched

for a “loan" by AMLASH/2 and,as he laughingly Stated,these "loans"

aa&a habitually +m» ..«- forever. We also estinated that the

various transoceanic phone calls he has made in Bis behalf, the 96

e mses he will incur in entertaining AMLASH/2,{ Aéberto BLANCO,}
02 Cimpsaru/19 and others will easily exceed the $500 he has been

‘advanced. A signed receipt was obtained.

4. . Security

There were no incidents of a security nature to report
as stated above, There were very few people in the offices due.
to the fact that today was Yom Kipper.
