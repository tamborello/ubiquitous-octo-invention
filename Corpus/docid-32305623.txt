ALEX: I°ll talk to him and have him go te JOE and
let JOE send him im. Or, I could sénd him
to the lawyer, but I’m just trying to ~
avoid that question if it came up..
HUMPHREYS: I don’t think it will, but it’s good.
ALEX: We got to get another witness.
_ HUMPHREYS: Another ome! We got to get a lot of them!
ALEX: And we got to get them before they get then.
HUMPHREYS: Yeah. You know who we could get to be a
, witness? He’d be a hell of a witness. |
ALEX: Who? |

HUMPHREYS: CLAIR.

The reference of ALEX to MONAGHAN is probably a -
reference to ROBERT F. MONAGHAN, an Assistant United States

Attorney in Chicago. The reference to CLINTON .

is a reference to STANFORD. CLINTON, who is an attorney in Chicago
and who is one of the attorneys representing ANTHONY ACCARDO in
his pending trial. It is obvious that the conversation--concerns
the trial of ACCARDO, who has been indicted for fraudulently
charging expenses for the use of his automobile which h@ claims
he used to sell "Foxhead Fourhundred” beer for the Premium

Beer Sales, Incorporated. It is apparent that ALEX amd —
HUMPHREYS are concerned with finding witnesses who will back

up ACCARDO'’s claim that he used the car during the course -

of selling "Foxhead Fourhundred.*

fhe Yorkshire referred to is believed to be the
Yorkshire Room Restaurant located at 2842 North Sheridan Road
in Chicago. r

The reference to STEVE by ALEX midway in the conversation
is probably a reference to STEVE DE KOSTA. It is noted
that DE KOSTA is ostensibly the owner and the Huckster's

Restaurant in Chicago. According to PCI a OTHER 4

burlesque dancer, who is intimately friendly with HENRY SUSK
and also well acquainted with GUS ALEX, the Huckster’s is operated
