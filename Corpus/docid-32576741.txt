fugitives in connection with the ITAR-Gamb1l ing

$150,000 bond. All four have been implicated |
in the gangland Slaying of Rudy Marfeo, Boston,
-, Massachusetts, bookmaker According to a |
former informant of our Boston office, the
Plans call for his urging our two Agents to
contact him, after which the hoodlums would
take the Agents under control. One Agent
would be killed immediately. SA Paul_Rico

to the plaee where John J. Kelley was being

guarded-by-U: S. Marshals. “Kelley is current-.
"ily cooperating with our—Boston office_and has
{Provided detailed information implicating

these hoodlums in’ the murder of Marfeo.

; The hoodlums believed that the marshals, j

‘| 'pon seeing Agent Rico, would relax, after
which they would kill Agent Rico, the marshals

and Kelley. The heodlums indicated that if
[orks locate SA Rico's exact address, they have

 

other plans in mind which were not furnished
our source. _ .

‘The Lerner mentioned in this teletype
when apprehended by our Boston office yester-'
day, commented to Agent Rico "You look just
like your pictures."' Lerner, according to 4
Kelley, is extremely courageous and appears to)
relish killing. . : ‘

- A teletype is being sent immediately to |
SAC, Boston, containing specific instructions |
to afford SA Rico and his family adequate
security; to. vigorously press their investi-
jgation toward locating the three fugitives :
involved in this plan; to insure U. s. Marshal:
