Ms. Thomas said that she took the matter to the Foriegn Relations Committee
only after she had tried to’ get relief through State Department channels.
She said that her case was handled at the State Department by Wilmet Hastings,
an-assistant to Eliot Richardson, and John McCumber. Ms. Thomas said that
it was McCumber who offered her. the job with the Foreign Service, and that
he is now associated with the Museum of Modern Art. She said that he has
always had strong ties to the CIA.

Ms. Thomas suggested two other people who might know something about
Charles Thomas and Elena Garro de Paz's allegations. Wally Stewart was the
Political Consul in Mexico City at the time and all of Charles Thomas'
reports went to him. He was Thomas' direct superior. Ms. Thomas said
that he was also a very good friend of the Legal Attache. The other person
Clare Boonstra was also a political officer and was aware of the
discussions with Elena. Ms. Thomas thinks that Stewart is retired in

Mexico and that Boonstra is retired somewhere in Florida.

He collected nearly 2,000 job
rejection letters. He went heavi-
ly into debt against his $10,000
Foreign Service annuity which
would begin at age 60. He was
considering a job as a night
waiter to save his family from
destitution. Now that he is dead,
his widow gets $5500 a year
from a government pension to
Support her two children.

Mrs. Thomas also has been
given a job in the State Depart-
ment. She intends to continue
her campaign to have her hus-
gand reinstated posthumously.

Today a “Mr. X” in the de-
partment che prefers to remain
anonymous) is facing the same
dilemma—being selected out for
‘too long in class,” eight years

in Class 4 without promotion. He!
too is under 50, therefore legally |

incligible for a pension: he is a
trained linguist and economist
with no. contacts outside the
diplomatic world,

At 45, he too is worried about
support for his wife and two
children. The best he has been
offered so far is two-year exten-
sion of his time in Class 4, mak-
ing him—he says—a “non-per-
son" ineligible for promotion.

Mr. X has reftised. He charges
the department with inequity
and injustice and is demanding
his “day. in court.” That means
a grievance committee to hear
his complaints — a committee
which the regulations say
should be formed within five
working days after the request
ts received.

He has gone right up the lad-
der in protest — from Director
of Personnel Howard P. Mace.
to Deputy Undersecretary of
State for Administration William
B. Macomber Jr., to Secretary
of State William P. Rogers him-
self. He claims that his whole
career in the Foreign Service
has been organized to insure his
ultimate “selection out.”

For instance, in the early ’60s
just after being promoted to
Class 4, he accepted several spe-
cial assignments. They were
considered a tribute to his excel-
lence — a year at Harvard Uni-
versity in. graduate economics at
government expense. another
year in a tough East European
Janguage course in Washington.

Out of Channels

Mr, X did not go to East Eu-
rope. He ended up in Geneva
working in the American mis-
sion_on international economics.
He liked the job enormously. But
he soon discovered that those
special assignments, taking him
out of the “normal” State De-
partment channels for efficiency
reports by superiors. had hurt

The © office — a group of
about 135 personnel profession-
als — is enormously important
jin organizing this procedure.
Macomber is in over-all charge,
but day-to-day operations — and
decisions — are controlled by
Mace.

The Staff Work

|. “O” Office does the staff work
for the promotion boards. “0”
Office files and channels the ef-
fiency reports which the promo-
tion boards receive each year on
every officer—reports written by
an officer's superior and re-
viewed at the next higher level.
Insiders insist that the boards,
inundated with thousands of re-
ports, rely heavily on the advice
of Mace’s subordinate—the chief
of the Performance Evaluation:
Division.

Each year the process is re-
peated. A candidate is rated,
promoted, or passed over. If he
is not in either the highest or
lowest percentage one year, he}
must start over in new com-
petition the next year.

Here is where time in class
takes a toll. As the years build
up in any one class, officers} o}
become desperate for promotion.
Mr. X believes that he was)
penalized in this competition,
because for at least two years
of the eight he was allowed, no
standard efficiency reports were
there for the promotion boards
to assess.

Nor does the loss of time end
there. By specific order of the
office, boards are ordered to
give lower priority to those offi-
cers remaining longest in their
class. An analysis in the May
1969 Foreign Service Journal
pointed out the stark results—
officers are allowed to remain 10
years in Class 3, but 93 percent
of all those promoted that year
to Class 2 had been in their
grade six years or less. -

Supporters of X argue that the
{wo years he lost, early during
his time in Class 4, were of cru-
cial importance. He had wona
quick promotion out of Class 5
only to become a victim of too-
long-in-class-4,

the tough competition for

the critics. They do not take a
position’ on the substance of ‘X’s
complaint. They simply support
his right to “due process of
law.”

They point out that the State
Department, alone in the huge
federal bureaucracy, does not
have an operational grievance
system, Despite the regula-
tions, only one hearing has been
held in 20 years—and that has
been dragging on for 18 months
without result.

“I am the first to admit that
we need a grievance. system,”
said Mace. “But we are all
babes in the wood on this thing,
it is all so new. Up until two
years ago I never heard a thing
about grievances over promo-
tion. It all seems the outgrowth
of the unrest of youth in this
country. Organizations of For-|
eign Service officers have be-
come outspoken advocates of
employe rights.”

The largest of those organiza-
tions—the American Foreign
Service Association—is demand-
ing immediate action. It hap-
pens to be in hot negotiations
‘with Macomber on an executive
order President Nixon is to issue
this summer on the whole range
of management-employee rela-
tions in the State Department,

Basis For Legislation

The association wants that or-
der to include an_ elaborate
grievance system. It has pro-
duced a draft—in fact, it is the
basis for the Bayh-Scott legisla-
tion. Sources in both Macom-
ber’s office and in the associa-
tion say that ‘something like”
this grievance system probably
will go into the President’s exec-
utive order,

Meanwhile
company in the “O” Office are
clearly trying to avoid revolt in
the ranks. The charges of injus-
tice, coercion, arbitrary deci-
sions are clearly embarrassing

Macomber has given Mrs.

cy ithia Thomas a job in the

fice of the science adviser in
the department at the $12,500-
$14,000 salary of Foreign Service
Class 5—just one rank below
that of her dead husband.

Ms. Thomas is a highly trained
woman. But even those close to
Macomber agree that Mrs.
Thomas was given the job—hard
to come by these days in the!
State Department—as an “act of
conscience.” The fact that Bayh’
has been investigating the
Thomas case and refusing: to
accept the official explanations
may be another reason, critics
say.

In another move, the director
general of the Foreign Service,

john H. Burns—who stands be-
tween Mace and Macomber in
the ‘‘O” hierarchy—has propos-;
ed, relaxation of the promotion
rules,

In essence the proposed

changes would end the “psycho-| °

logical insecurity” in the middle
grades of 3, 4 and 5. Instead of
the short time now allowed in
each class, the officer would
now be given 20 years to get
through’ all three classes into
higher ranking Class 2.

have 20-year tenure. The depart-
ment intends to ask Congress to’

sults of departmental task
forces set up by Macomber in
1969. Mace and others claim that
now the “O” Office is being
made the scapegoat for an in-
human promotion system prev-|
iously forced on the department
by demands of money and long-
time overstaffing of middle and
upper ranks.

They point to the forced reduc-
tions in personnel ordered by the
Johnson administration—the so-
called Balpa 1 and Balpa 2 cut-
backs, those ordered due to)
“halance-of- payments” difficul-
ties. Under Nixon came a third
alphabetical exercise in man-
power—the so-called Opred, Op-
erations Reductions of the State
Department.

Mace estimates that since 1968
these cutbacks have cost the ce-

artment 1500 foreign service of-
Fers, all through executive or-
der from the White House. Only
coincidentally the Nixon admin-
istration has set out to “rational-
ize” Foreign Service employ-
ment by getting new balance be-
tween young and old, specialists
and “generalists.”

The critics answer that Ma-
comber’s tactics in earrying out
admittedly difficult operations
have only demoralized the serv-
ice more. In the name of greater
efficiency and despite universal
suspicion of his ‘‘O” office, he
has just moved to centralize and
contro] all personnel programs
still more tightly from that of-

officer Charles W. Thomas, 48,
unemployed lawyer and linguist,
put a gun to his head at his Po-
tomac Avenue NW- home.

Almost two years earlier, July

1969, Thomas had been forced

out of the State Department
without a pension, ‘No one
claimed he was incom}
a security risk, He was simph
victim of competition, ha
failed to gain promotion out of
Class 4 Foreign Service officer
in the required eight years.
Today the department estab-
lishment acknowledges that “un-
fortunate mistakes” were made

it or

a

fice. This action is based on a
recommendation of one of his
task forces, which, in turn—the
critics say—was ‘controlled by
the personnel bureaucrats.

“O” Office has also attempted
‘to drown out demands for an in-
dependent grievance system by
setting up “unofficial” hearing’
panels through its own jurisdic-
tion, These are in the hands of
Robert C, F. Gordon, an old-
hand career officer. Macomber
commissioned him a year ago as
departmental ombudsman to
hear complaints from the serv-
ice on everything from travel
allowances to promotion.

More disenchanted critics
charge that the result has be-

When asked why she knew too much, Ms. Thomas hedged and did not divulge
any specifics. Ms. Thomas’ said that their last contact with Elena was

in 1968. At that time Elena called her husband from New York. She (Elena)
said that she was being held at a hotel against her will and asked Charles
Thomas for help. Thomas tried to help her. Cynthia does not remember

all the things that her husband did to try to help, but does remember that
he called Octavio Paz. She was sure that Thomas took other actions at

the time but cannot remember them. She said that he always kept extensive
notes and she would try to locate his notes from this incident. After
contacting Octavio, Charles Thomas tried to locate Elena at the hotel she
claimed to be at. When he called there he was told that she had checked
out in a hurry, leaving her luggage behind.

Ms. Thomas said that Elena had trusted Charles Thomas and had taken
him into her inner circle of friends. Most.of Elena's friends were Mexican
intellectuals and leftests, hence the value of this contact to the CIA.

Ms. Thomas said that the CIA used Thomas to get information from these
people and that Charles Thomas willingly cooperated in this effort.

Ms. Thomas offered two reasons why Charles Thomas’ report of Elena's
allegations recieved the type of response from the American officials that
it did. The first reason was that Win Scott was very close to President
Diaz Ordaz and that this, in some way, may have been. the reason for suppressing
Elena's story. The second reason that she offered was that Ferris, the
Legal Attache at the time, resented someone from the political section
poking around in his business.

Ms. Thomas said that her husband had always "bailed out" the CIA

by providing them with the information that he obtained. She said, because

of this the CIA was always trying to "pick up" their expenses but the
RE y

HW 53060 DocId:32263513 Page 3
always declined the CIA's offers.

The Thomas’ left Mexico City in 1967. At that time a CIA officer
took over Charles Thomas’ contacts. Ms. Thomas said that the officer
was named Stanley Watson and that he was now retired and living in
Cuenavaca, Mexico. Ms. Thomas termed Waton a "bungling manipulator".
She said that Waston was involved in some way that she is not sure of
in the Student riots in Mexico in 1968. She speculated that he may
have been involved in inciting them. When asked specifically whether
Watson had taken over the contact with Elena in 1967 Ms. Thomas
responded affirmatively.

Not long after the last contact with Elena in 1968, Charles Thomas
learned that he was being "selected out" of the Foreign Service. The
reason for his selectién out was that he had not recieved a promontion
in the required manner. After his selection out Mr. Thomas applied for
over 2000 jobs. He remained unemployed nevertheless until his suicide
in 1971. It is Ms. Thomas' beleif that he was blackballed. Ms. Thomas
provided an article about her husband that appeared in the Washington

: Evening Star. (Copy attached.) She also showed us a copy of an article
that appeared in Time magazine, p. 20, on 11/15/71.

After Charles’ suicide, Cynthia took actions to get her husband
reinstated in the Foreign Service. As a result of this she obtained
a job in the Foreign Service. William Fulbright and the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee held hearings on the case. Most of Charles’ documents
were turned over to the SFRC. Mrs. Thomas dealt with Robert Dockery (phon.)
at the SFRC. After holding hearings the SFRC introduced’ a private bill

which reinstated Charles Thomas. (Copies of report and bill attatched.)
