project. ,

Also relative to the above, Miami airtel to Bureau
dated 9/14/62 set out the information obtained by the Miami
Office from MM 768-C, and Miami noted that only a few individuals
know such information, and due to the closeness of informant
to the situation, Miami recommends the matter be reported only
in the administrative section of the report at this time.

  
 

The Miami Office's attention is directed to referenced
Bureau communication requesting that investigative efforts
be expended to resolve this matter so that Bureau can be provided
with appropriate communication suitable for dissemination.

Miami notified the Bureau by airtel dated 9/14/62 as
follows:

MM 768-C advised on 8/31/62 that during the past year

ivhe ‘has been acquainted with LARRY DE JOSEPH, He said DE JOSEPH

idea?

claims to have been an employee of SANTO TRAFFICANTE in the '
Sans Souci Hotel in Havana prior to the Castro Revolution. !
DE JOSEPH has on a number of occasions stated he is a good friend
of TRAFFICANTE and is in touch with him occasionally.
t

The informant, who had been previously advised of the
Buréau's interest in TRAFFICANTE, advised that, in order to
effect a meeting with TRAFFICANTE, he proposed to DE JOSEPH
that: TRAFFICANTE provide the financial backing for a.gambling
ship to be operated off the Florida Keys. The informant would
make all the necessary arrangements and would ask for a percentage
commission for his planning and arranging for a boat.

As a result of this proposal, DE JOSEPH arranged a
meeting between the informant and TRAFFICANTE. The informant,
DE JOSEPH, and IRVING FEINBURG, an acquaintance of the informant
who is connected with Escott Construction Co., Miami Beach, went
to Sonny's Italian Restaurant, 247 23rd Street, Miami Beach, on:
the night of 8/30/62.

According to the informant, FEINBURG went only at the .
informant's invitation and did not even know who TRAFFICANTE was.

They were met at Sonny’s Restaurant by TRAFFICANTE, LO RADY,
and JUDITH SALVAT, who appeared to be the girl friend .
TRAFFICANTE. | lee

At this meeting the proposed setting up of the gambling
ship to be operated off the Florida Keys was discussed by the
informant, TRAFFICANTE, and BRADY. TRAFFICANTE agreed to
consider arranging financing for the gambling ship and instructed
the informant to give him more specific details, particularly as
to arrangements that could be made for securing a suitable ship.
They also discussed the possibility of constructing a hotel in
Martinique, and Escott entered into this discussion. TRAFFICANTE,
however, was not agreeable to this suggestion.

“According to the informant BRADY did the majority of the
talking for TRAFFICANTE and gave the impression that he was trying :
to impress TRAFFICANTE in the way he talked and discussed the _ I
matter with the informant.

 

 

 

The informant expects future meetings between himself and {
TRAFFICANTE, or one of his representatives, regarding this matter,

‘On 9/4/62, the informant advised that he has negotiated
with LEWIS FRAZIER, owner of the motor vessel "Fleures" to buy «
this vessel and have it converted into a gambling ship. The A
ship is 180° in length and would be capable of handling about
100 gambling passengers. It now flies the Panamanian flag: The
price of the ship would be $35,000 and would cost $65,000 to
convert into a plush gambling ship. Informant said this had been
discussed with DE JOSEPH and DE JOSEPH told him he would relay
this on to his "associates."

The Philadelphia Office has advised that extensive
physical coverage of the wedding of JEAN BRUNO on 8/26/62
and continual contact with PH 623-C* and PH 591-C* failed to
develop any information to establish that SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR.
attended either the wedding or the subsequent reception and. x
dinner.. A complete list.of persons in attendance at the dinner: -
was obtained by the Philadelphia Office, and subject's name was
t not on such list.
