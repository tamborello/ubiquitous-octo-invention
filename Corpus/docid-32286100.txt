CELSO CARRETO

 

; During the course of investigations by [ex -34 en
Subject's old address, Amsterdam 82, Penthouse, xic D.F.,
Mexico, he determined that Subject had a manservant named ‘
CELSO CARRETO while he was residing at that address. Suppose
QQ CARRETO had moved to the United States and, in fact, there wa

a report that'a friend of the Subject arranged his document
to immigrate to the Unite jtates. CARRETO was supposed
to have gone to New- york (SV) 7,

Subsequently, this same source contacted Mexic city,
architect ROBERTO MORALES, described as a close associate
of the Subject, on a pretext. MORALES also identified CELSO
CARRETO as Subject's house servant and said that he had gone
to the United States and that Subject and other friends had Bf
arranged his documents {G¢¥1{)- 4 }

  
 

Thus, it appears that from two sources there was
information that CARRETO was Subject's servant and, wit ae i=

PATRICIA LANGFORD advised that the visa was issued in part
upon the recommendation of JOHN O'GRADY, former Labor Attache
at the American Embassy , Mexico City, who brought Mr. and Mrs.
GRANOFF to her personally and requested that everything possible
be done to. expedite the issuance of the visa. It appeared

of the extraordinary pressure exerted by O'G DY and the
GRANOFFs. Mrs. GRANOFF was Supposedly a singer who was
known by the stage name of KITTY CALLEN. y

Above is for the information of Newakk and New York,
Newark because CARRETO reportedly was going to Englewood,
presumably the residence of the GRANOFFs, and New York because
of reports that he was going to that area and because he
departed from the New York-aifport. y

It would appear that CARRETO worked for Subject and
then, possibly subsequently, for the GRANOFFs. His apparent
stay in the New York area until September would appear to
constitute a possible INS violation. W

: It is considered that, as a former employee, he
might be a rich source of information concerning Subject's
activities in the United States. It may be also that the

-- GRANOFFs were operating as a front for Subject, or may have
just met Subject casually in Cuernavaca, “A :
