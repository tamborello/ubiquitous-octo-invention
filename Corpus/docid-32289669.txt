CHAVEZ originally came to know ARTURO R, ESPAILLAT because

of CHAVEZ' interest in starting a Teamsters Union in the

DR. When CHAVEZ learned that ARTURO ESPAILLAT was imprisoned
(in the DR) in the summer of 1962, CHAVEZ made it kmown to
RAMPIS TRUJILLO and those responsible for ARTURO'S imprisonment
that if anything happened to ARTURO, "the Dominican Republic
would forget what a ship looks like" and that "Chavez would

get Jimmy Hoffa to back him".

ARTURO R. ESPAILLAT is a former general in
the army of the DR and served as Ccnsul

General for the DR in New York. ESPAILLAT
presently is reported to reside in Canada.

SJ T~1, a confidential source abroad, has advised
CHAVEZ checked in at the Nassau Eeach Hotel on 5 tober el,
1961, in company with two men, one being JAI AMADOR, 800
Figueroa Street, Santurce, Puerto Rico, with whom he shared
a-sutté Until their departure on October 2lt, 1961, On
checking out of the hotel, CHAVEZ paid the hotel bill with

a Teamsters Union check drawn on the Banco de Puerto Rico,
Stop 17. Branch, Santurce, Puerto Rico. Besides paying the
hotel bill, CHAVEZ cashed two checks for himself but these |
have since been returned by the bank in Puerto Rico for
insufficient funds. The hotel manager has written CHAVEZ

at the address furnished by him, namely 30 Calle Doncelia,
Santurce, Puerto Rico, but to date has received no reply. (@) -

According to SJ T-1, Bahama authorities in
Nassau did not request CHAVEZ and his wife to depart upon
the arrival of powerful "Trujillistas" in Nassau. CHAVEZ

d
departed from the Bahamas on October 2 961, and was not
in the Bahamas at the time of ARISME RUJILLO on \
Novenber~T," 1561. (@ ;

SJ T-1 further advised that it was rumored that
on October 22, 1961, ARTURO ESPAILLAT spend the afternoon
drinking with some "foreigners" in a room at the Nassau Beach i
Hotel, CHAVEZ may have been present but this has not been
confirmed, &) :
