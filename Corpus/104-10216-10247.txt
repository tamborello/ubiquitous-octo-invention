SUBJECT: Telephone Call from Bob Owen in Madrid
Be AMLASH-1/AMBIDDY-1 Meeting

e,

1, Bob Owen and Tony Siljo called from Madrid and
stated that AMWHIP-1 requested that "Nick" inform AMLA8H-1
that AMBIDDY-1 was coming to Europe to see him, Owen and
Bilio were both informed by Nick that we did mot wish to
become involved in this union if it developed, and therefore
Rick would not advise AMLASH-1 of AMWHIP-1l's request. Owen
and Siliy were toid that we favor the move provided the two
principals can arrange it themselves and KUBARK is not the
broker. The above was double talked over the phone but it
was clear to Nick that AMWHIP~1, AMBIDDY-1 and AMLASH-1 were
the parties involved,

2. Upon Owen's return to Paris on 10 December, KUBARK’s
position on bringing AMLASH-] and AMBIDDY-1 together was
fully discussed with Owen, A written memorandum on the sub-
ject was left with the Paris Station.
