assassination attempt which would have taken place in Sweden
when Premier Khrushchev came there to speak to the Swedish
Reichstag, subsequent to the death of United Nations Secretary

- General Dag Hammorskjold.

Additionally, Ely claimed to know the identity of
aman deseribed in a recent book relating to the assassination
of President Kennedy, who was supposed to be a hired killer
for the CIA named "Saul." When Ely's Privacy Act requests of
the CIA failed to produce information to him, he sent a letter
to the CIA, United States Dapartment of State, Department of
State Consular Service, and the Church Committee which indi-
cated he would toll all he knew of the CIAwmless they revealed
¢o him all they have on record concerning him. This letter
seemed to result in the surveillances he suspects are. directed
at him, and as a result he has consulted various lawyers, police
officials, and his employers for aid in determining what will
stop the suspected surveillances. He indicated his office has
been broken into and his mail has been tampered with. .

Mr. Ely requested the Denver Division of the FBI
get in contact with the local office of the CIA to notify them
that he is willing to say nothing about the CIA to anyone if
they will cease their interests in him. He mentioned he had
received a personal letter from Senator Church of tho Church
Committee assuring him his case would be heard subsequent to
the Committec’s termination on February 21, 1976. Mr. Ely
advised he would furnish nothing to the Church Committee now
unless obliged to by it.

During the interview, Mr. Ely appeared calm, articulate,
educated, and sober. He indicated his IQ was in excess of 160
and he had graduated from three different colleges. He was weil
dressed and business-like.

 

January 23, 1976, Spectal Agent in Charge
advised his office has no
vecord identifiable with Mr. Ely.)

. Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt SECREL
Re: Ilona Marita Lorenz

The attached newspaper stories alleged that "Alex

Rorke, a wealthy adventurer who worked for both CIA and the

FBI" was involved with Frank Fiorini, a "CIA Agent;' who recruited
the subject in an assassination plot against Castro.

Alexander I. Rorke is a former FBI clerical employee who, during
‘the time of the alleged plot in 1960, was a free lance
photographer. He had been temporarily detained by the Cuban
Government in 1959 and for many years was active in anti-Castro |
activities in the.Florida area. From time to time he contacted
the FBI and was dealt with at arms length because of his
adventurer, personality and self-serving motives. He disappeared
on a plane flight in 1963 to Central America, Frank Fiorini

also known as Frank Anthony Sturgis was well known to the FBI
for his anti-Castro activities in the U. S. following his~
defection from Cuba in 1958. He was. also one of the Watergate
break=in subjects... : ,

Additional information in FBI files indicates that the
subject also furnished information concerning the July 26th
Movement in the U. S. This group was the original political and
military organization which Castro used to overthrow the Batista
Regime in Cuba. The subject was also interviewed in 1962 in

' Florida regarding “a - White Slavery Traffic Act (WSTA) case and
admitted being the mistress of Marcos Perez Jimenez, former
President of Venezuela, who fathered her daughter, Investigation
failed to establish the subject was a victim in the above mentioned |
WSTA case. The subject{is the present wife of NY 7511-IA who
furnishes information on Soviet and Soviet-bloc matters. She

-, is aware of her husbands cooperation with the New York Office. and] @
has, on occasion, volunteered information ‘of value. The subject”
is presently separated from her husband and in April, 1976, the
New York Office opened a potential criminal informant file’ on her
because of her contacts with a New York'‘area crime figure,
Guiseppe Faggiano, and a race horse trainer, She furnished
information regarding gambling, shylocking and bank robbery matters.

' However, because of the recent publicity set out in the attached
newspaper clippings, the fact that she is planning to write a book
concerning her Cuban experiences and the fact that she terminated
her contact with criminal elements,her case was Closed by the.

Mr. Ely ‘wished to explain his concern over being
surveilled and felt it was thework of the CIA. When asked
what would prompt such surveillance, he stated that previously
he had been self-employed in an auto safety device firm.

Having had difficulties with patent infringements on his
devices in Europe, he had occasion to travel to Sweden and
Switzerland. During 1961, Ely was in Sweden and as he was
having marital difficulties with his first wife, entered into
an affair with a Swedish citizen, Helena Johnson. Miss Johnson
‘was an agent for various art firms. At one point in their
affair, Johnson urged Ely to purchase a moese hunting license
and a Swedish war surplus rifle fitted with a Zeiss scope so
that he could bag a moose and sell it for about $700. Sensing
something was amiss, Ely returned the rifle to Johnson and
discontinued their liaison. While going with Miss Johnson he
learned she was a member of the Baltic League, a violently
