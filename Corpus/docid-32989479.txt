WASHINGON, Nov. 19—On Oct, 10,
1963, the then-Attorney General of the
United States put his personal signa-
ture on a document that launched and
legitimatized one of the most horren-
dous abuses of Federal police power in
this century.

In Senator Frank Church’s subcom-
mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and subse-
quent unauthorized bugging and at-
tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther
King Jr. is being gingerly examined,
with the “investigation” conducted in
such a way as not to unduly em-
barrass officials of the Kennedy or
Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has
focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, when*
the committee counsel first set forth
the result of shuffling through press
clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-!
partment had existed in 1962; today,
an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it
was Robért Kennedy who authorized
the wiretap of Dr. King, and that “the
President of the United States and the
Attorney General specifically discussed
their concern of Communist influence
with Dr. King.”

But the Church committee showed
no zest for getting further to the Ken-
nedy root of this precedent to Water-
gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church
were willing to let the chips fall where
they may, he would call some knowl-
edgeable wiinesses into the glare of
the camera lights and ask them some
questions that have gone unasked for
thirteen years.

For example, he could call Nicholas
Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-
nedy’s deputy and successor, and ask
what he knows of the Kennedy de-
cision to wietap Dr. King. Who at
Justice concurred in the recommenda-
tion? How does the F.B.I. know the ;
President was consulted or informed? +

After Mr. Katzenbach assumed of- °
fice, and the wiretapping continued, ,
he was told by angry newsmen that
the F.B.I. was leaking scurrilous in-
formation about Dr. King. Why did he
wait for four months, and for a thou-
sand telephonic interceptions, to dis
continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sort of testimony
would erode Senator Church's political
base. That is why we do not see for-
mer Assistant F.B.I. director Cartha
(Deke} Deloach, Lyndon Johnson's
personal contact with the F.B.I. in the
witness chair. What did President
Johnson know about the character-
assassination plot and whea did he
know it? What conversations took
place between Mr. Deloach and Presi-
dent Johnson on the tapping of Dr.
King, or about the use of the F.B.1. in
any other intrusions into the lives of

Mr. Church’@ Cover -Up

“The committee is not asking em embar-
rassing questions even when answers

are readily available. A. couple of ~

weeks ago, at an open hearing, an
F.B.I, man inadvertently started to
blurt out an episode about newsmen
who were weritapping in 1962 wit
the apparent knowledge of Attorney’
General Kennedy. The too-willing wit*
ness was promptly shooshed into sig
lence, and told that such informatiort
would be developed only in executive
session. Nobody raised an eyebrow.
That pattern ot containment by the-
Church committee is vividly shown by
the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican and Democratic con-

ESSAY

 

 

ventions which were ordered by Lyn-
don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-
cal headquarters were worse than the
crime committed at Watergate, since
they involved the use of the F.B.I,
but the Chirch investigators seem to
be determinetl not to probe too deeply.

If F.B.I. documents say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why are those men not given the
same opportunity to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent’s men? If Lyndon Johnson com-
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the F.BI. to spy on political

opponents, who can’ be brought for-

ward to tell us ail about it?

But that. would cause embarrass-—

ment to Democrats, and Senator
Church wants to embarrass profes-
sional employees of investigatory
agencies only. A new sense of Con-
gressional decorum exists, far from
the sense of outrage expressed in the
Senate Watergate commiitee’s hear-
ing room. When it is revealed that the
management of NBC News gave press
credentials to L.B.J.’s spies at the 1964
convention, everybody blushes demure-,
ly--and nobody demands to know!
which network executive made what!
decision under what pressure.

I have been haranguing patient”
readers for years about the double

standard applied to Democratic and’

Republican political crimes, and had
hoped the day would come when the
hardball precedents sct by the Ken-
nedy and Johnson men would be laid
before the public in damning detail.

Obviously, Democrat Frank Church
is not the man to do it, His. jowl-
shaking indignation is all too selec-
tive; the trail of high-level responsi-
bility for the crimes committed against
Dr. King and others is evidently going
to be allowed to cool.

Pity. You'd think that after all the
nation has been through in the past
few years, our political leaders would
have learned that the one thing that
brings you down is the acc of cover-

ing up, ees
