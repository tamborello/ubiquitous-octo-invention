8 A president has been shot and who wants the FBI, Secret

9 Service and. everybody else pouring over them because they

10 were sitting there with an umbrella.

1 This is the first time we have seen this man's face

12 and I think we should say many of the critics have mentioned
e@ 13 this umbrella man and we have found no vast importance to

14 it, but here is his face and would someone pléase come

15 forward and tell us if they know him?

16 The individual himself would be cragy to come forward.

17 Mr. Blakey. This is the first time there has been a

18 picture of him from the front. In the past it has always

19 been a person from behind.

20 If the background was given to the newspaper people

21 and the statement was made, "This is only one among a number

22 of things being pursued by the committee and it is not of
e 23 central importance to us, but is a question raised by the

3 Mrs. Burke. I suspect there are other photographs.

4 ~~ Stokes. When you reléase this photo and ask the
5 press to find out for. you who he is, doesn't this lend
6 credence then to precisely what the press is saying? "See
7 there, I told you; they haven't found out anything."
8 I think you just invite that reaction from the press.
Mrs. Burke. Of course, we could indicate we have found
9
10 a photograph of the umbrella man, which nobody else has until
11 now.
12 Mr. Devine. But we would want to talk to him as a
r ) 13 witness rather than as a suspect.
14 Mr. Fauntroy. It would be nice to clear that up one
15 way or the other.
16 Mr. McKinney. One thing the critics will say is that
17 they didn't follow up the umbrella man.
18 Mr. Dodd. They are going to be saying things for the
19 next hundred years. If we go into this thing with that in
20 mind, we will be basket cases.

W vr. Pauntroy: The thing that has always puzzled me about

2 this is, with all the attention focused upon this theory,

3 we have. had no one to come forward (rom Day One) to say "I am
@ : 4 he."

5 With respect, therefore, to the question, shall we

6 ‘publish this in the hope of finding the person, I tend

7 rather to be pessimistic about{he prospects.

8 ur (devine. He looks like he is 65 years old in that

9 picture. That would make him 80 today.

10 tir Jrauntroy. No? that is not the man.

11 The question is, what public relations value is there

12 to feeling that we are pursuing every lead? I just don't
e@ 13 think it will be productive. If people have been talking

14 about the umbrella man and he hasn't come forward =

15 Mr. Dodd. If that is our only public pronouncement, I

16 think it is going to focus an awful lot of attention on this

7 one single aspect of the thing. It makes it look as

18 ‘though we place a lot of credibility in that.

Chaivman Z id ,

19 Mae. Stokes. Mr.jEdgar.!

20 Mr. Edgar. One of the suggestions I would have ona

21 public pronouncement would be to make, on the first or second

22 day of public hearings, a major emphasis on this photograph.
e 23 That way you would have major TV coverage with a statement

24 that at the beginning of our hearings + and this is one of

25 the unanswered questions = I kind of agree with Walter, if we

it would require a committee resolution to make them public.

Gx might add it might also require the permission of Time-

Life, since they are their photographs.

Mr. Dodd. Mr. Chairman.

aM Stokes. Mr.jDodd.

Mr.Dodd. I have read that one "Thirty Seconds in

 

Dallas." In fact, they even have it that there is a gun in
there; that you open it up and it fires. I just wonder how
many theories there are. I know the signal theory and I know
about you opening it up and somehow there is a triggering
mechanism in the top of the thing. Those are basically the
two.

Mr. Blakey. ves.

Mr. Dodd. The former having a lot more support, I
presume even among the critics, than the latter.

ur (plakey. He is one of the mystery figures. It is the
kind of thing people want explained. Why would a man have an
umbrella up on a sunny day?

Mr. Edgar. Do we have that picture with us?

at

Mr (Blakey. No; we don't. It is part of the Zapruder
film. You can see right below where the President is. It
actually raises just before the assassination. These are
separate pictures. You can see the:.umbrella laying right
here to the right of the light post. This is indeed an

umbrella man.

There are two other matters I would bring to your atten-
tion. One is an outstanding issue. Former president Ford
was a member of the Warren Commission. Some time in the.
next cniPhy ee sphey days he probably ought to be talked

to and I would solicit your advice on the way in which that

 

occurs.
If he is in town for another purpose, it might be

appropriate to have an executive session in which he could
x

come in and talk about the Warren Commissiorand his role on
it.

jwould it be advisable for the committee, with due dignity, to

release these to the press with an effort being made to
solicit anyone who could iden‘t-ify the individuals?

G The umbrella man is in no sense a central figure in the
committee's investigation. He is a central figure in the <
critical literature. The argument is made that he had an
umbrella on a sunny day and that the umbrella was raised
just before the assassination and-was somehow a signal
relating to the assassination.

If it were possible to identify him and have him come
forward, it might be one way which that aspect of the
critical literature could be explained.

Our ability to identify him simply by showing this
photograph to people in Dallas is limited. If we release
it to the press,. they could obviously give it nation-wide
circulation.

There are plusses and minuses if we did this. It might
appear to some credible people we are pursuing the umbrella
man theory, which lacks a certain credibility.

On the other hand, if these are printed and we indicate
we don't know who the person is, I suppose oné of the first
things that will be raised is, "Why didn't you give it to the
press earlier? We could have identified him at any time."

I don't know that there is an easy answer either way.

I also don't know that this is a terribly important issue,

but if we were to do it) it probably ought to be done now and

and flaking it again. Then you lose the umbrella and you can
see the President. ; ; .

Gp .

A We have photographs taken by other people immediately
after the shooting. Everyone in the plaza is facing the
knoll, running in that direction, and the umbrella man and
his friend are the only two people standing facing the
complete opposite direction and then the umbrella man is
sitting down, which no one else is doing. That is why the
critics have focused on him so much, though they have never
seen this particular photograph,

Mrs. Burke. Could I suggest a resolution that would
authorize the fhairman, in his discretion, to approve the
press release, consistent with the dignity of the committee, -
not ‘involving the committee in an umbrella theory and consist~
ent with Time-Life's permits.
Mr. McKinney. I would so move.

want a record vote? ,

There are a couple of matters of information you should

be aware of.
