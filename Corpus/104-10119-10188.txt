1. Hal Tittsler, ASAC, MFO called to request
a name check on Hemming and a Ron Mongul or Mongel.

2. Tittsler was advised that OS had no record
of Mongul or Mongel, but that a file existed on
Hemming.

3. Tittsler explained that the Miani DCD Office
was queried by the Dade County Organized Crime Division
as to whether or not Hemming ever worked for the CIA
in Mexico. The same inquiry pertained to Mongel
or Mongul. :

4. I told Hal that Hemming never worked for
the CIA, and that he has falsely claimed to have
worked for the CIA on several occasions. I also
said that I thought this should be the limit of his
response other than to refer the Organized Crime
Division to the United States Attorney's Office in
Miami for further information concerning Hemming,
as he was to have been brought to trial there in
August 1977.

5. I also advised Hal that inquiries of this
nature should be formalized. 02
