that information in government possession in respect to hood-
lums which we got from BROWN and RUSTON would, in any case,
be most properly presented to any Defense Counsel from the
files of the ATTD itself. . : ;

 

The Bureau is requested to advise Albany in the
event it is desired the information in the memoranda regard-
\ _ing BROWN and RUSTON be obtained from them on a current basis
with clearance to disseminate it. It is noted both BROWN
and RUSTON have been reported as having testified before. the
Special Grand Jury in the SDNY which returned the indictment
in U.S. vs. BONANNO, et al.

 

Both BROWN and RUSTON have been interviewed in
hoodlum perjury cases and their interviews reflected on
FD 302's were, of course, all furnished on a non-confidential
basis, after obtaining clearance and with the understanding
that testimony might be required and this, of course, presents
no problem. It is recommended that only the letterhead memor aiida
reflecting interviews with BROWN and RUSTON designated on pages
following as items 44 and 45 (BROWN) and item 111 (RUSTON) be
disseminated.

¢

In respect to MELVIN JOHN BLOSSOM, the Bureau's
attention is particularly directed to the fact that he was
formerly Confidential Informant AL 3002-C, discontinued by Vv
Albany letter. 3/24/59. Of course, he is known to the Attorney
General's Special Group at New York City and his name undoubtedly
has been mentioned in testimony before the Special Grand Jury.
In addition, he has been interviewed and carried openly in the
hoodlum perjury cases in the recent past.

a ~ A review of the memoranda reflecting interviews
with BLOSSOM will indicate that initial memorandum and FD 302's
_ contain all material information he furnished regarding hoodlums -
“herein and that the numerous other memoranda contain little
information of value and, by their number, content and regularity
of date of interview clearly indicate that we were using BLOSSOM:
-as an ‘informant. He furnished information on a confidential
‘basis, except in the initial interview and the perjury case
interviews mentioned. Accordingly it is recommended that there
‘be disseminated, in respect to interviews with BLOSSOM, only.
those letterhead memoranda designated as items 9, 31 and 33 on
the following pages. --

The memoranda submitted herewith are listed in alpha-—
betical order, by name of person interviewed, then by date of
interview, on the bottom of this page and following pages. Each
memorandum is identified by date of interview, name of witness,
communication in which initially set forth,in that order. A
notation "no" meaning no FD 302 or signed statement is entéred at
the end of each line, except where there is an FD 302 or signed
statement, in which instances the notation entered is "302" or
