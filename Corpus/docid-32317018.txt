PG 72-187

ON SEPTEMBER 15, 1976, PG €@3-PC, IN RESPONSE TO
A QUESTION REGARDING WHAT SOURCE KNEW ABOUT THE ROSELLI
MURDER, SOURCE ADVISED THAT A RECENT EX-CON BY THE NAME
OF GALENTI (PHONETIC) HAD SOME PARTICIPATION IN THE HIT
ON ROSELLI, AND PROBABLY wAS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. GALENTI

WAS FURTHER IDENTIFIED aS BEING APPROXIMATELY AGE 62,

 

AND ASPIRING TO TAKE OVER CARLO GAMBINO'S POSITION IN
NEy YORK. SOURCE ADVISED THAT DUE TO ROSELLI'S AGE, THE
MOB KNEW ROSELLI WOULD EVENTUALLY TALK TO THE GOVERNMENT i
INVESTIGATORS CONCERNING CASTRO ASSASSINATION PLOTS.

THE REASON THOUGHT TO BE FOR ROSELLI'S TELLING ALL WAS THAT
HE WANTED TO AVOID GOING TO JAIL, WHICH THE MOB FELT -wOUuLD
BE AN YNEXPECTABLE ALTERNATIVE TO ROSELLI IF HE wOULD NOT

 

TALK. A FURTHER COMMENT BY THE SOURCE WAS THAT YOUNGER
MOB MEMBERS DID NOT FEAR JAIL, BUT OLDER MOB MEMBERS DID
BECAUSE THE OLDER MEMBERS ARE AFRAID OF DYING BEFORE THEY

GET OWT OF JAIL.
