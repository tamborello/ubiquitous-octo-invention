. * On April 18, 1967, MM T-1 advised as follows:

GARCIA VIDAL advised the source that he had been
talking with ALBERTO ARDURA recently. ARDURA told ‘nim that
everything was going well and that possibly they would join
forces in their bolita operation in a limited way. The
source believed that VIDAL meant \""layof£" operation,

GARCIA VIDAL mentioned that he was quite upset
over the fact that the FBI: had been surveilling and
interviewing his son EVARISTICO in connection with.a Revolution-
ary plot to bomb some embassy in Canada. He mentioned that he
had no: problems in his bolita operation since he was well
protected from local police action.

GARCIA mentioned that he had cemented relations ~
with friends in New York in order to obtain the lottery
° tickets for the New York lottery, which begins in June,
1967. GARCIA VIDAL asked the source to join him and work
for him in the New York lettery ticket operation.

GARCIA told the source that he closes his "bolita
bank" .at midnight every Tuesday and Friday. . The Tuesday
closing is connected with bolita writing for the. drawing :
of the "Puérto Rican." The Friday night closing is connected |

with the Saturday night drawing of the "Cuba" bolita. He
told the source that he does not permit the bolita writer”

. to make bets after,midnight on these days although he himself,
since he is the boss,- would take a bet after midnight if it
were from a friend of his.

. When GARCIA VIDAL came to the United States
from Cuba, he had previously sent out approximately
$500,000 to a close associate in Miami, MIGUEL PEREZ .
_ PITA. PEREZ PITA had a safe deposit box in the First
National Bank of Miami for EVARISTO, PEREZ PITA still
| has the confidence of EVARISTO and recommends people to.
' GARCIA for loans. If PEREZ PITA recommends a man, GARCIA |
will loan the money.
EVARISTO used to go to the First National Bank
on a daily basis and could be seen any day between 11:00
and 12 noon. He used to have a special bank officer, an
American, whom he contacted to handle his business personally.
-This man has changéd jobs and is now new business manager
of a mercantile bank located on 57th Avenue and Southwest
9th Street.. With this man at the other bank, source feels
that EVARISTO has changed his operation to this bank. =~

Source has known TRAFFICANTE personally for

years. He has been in personal contact during the past

- four years on numerous occasions asking for loans and
advice, Each time he would contact TRAFFICANTE, he would
do so through MACHO GENER who would arrange the meeting.
GENER was formerly a representative in Cuba and was employed —
by TRAFFICANTE at $100 a week to take any calls, make :
appointments and generally be the "arranger." GENER no
longer has this position and now if source wants to contact
TRAFFICANTE he must do so through GARCIA VIDAL.

\

RAUL GONZALEZ JEREZ, formerly of thie Club Intine,
was very close to SANTO in Cuba and presumably is a close’
friend... He is not connected to the bolita activities in Miami. .

SANTO once mentioned to source that EVARISTO had
given him $20,000 that he needed. oo.

: , Source has met with SANTO after the appointments
made by GENER at the Doral Beach Hotel Sonny's s Restaurant

in Miami Beach on several occasions ¢ i ae
“at the Mayflower Restaurant on Northwest seth Stree

- Miami Avena.
