ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT
JOHN FI KENNEDY
NOVEMBER 22, 1963,

DALLAS, TEXAS

The "Washington Post" for February 16, 1968, carried
an article entitled "Witnesa Backs Up Garrison." This article
reported that Max Gonzales, a court clerk, said that he witnessed
meetings at New Orleans’ Lakefront Airport in “either June or
July” of 1963 between Edgar Eugene Bradley of North Hollywood,
California, and the late David W. Ferrie, The article reports
that Garrison is attenpting to extradite Edgar Eugene Bradley
on conspiracy charges. Garrison reportedly stated that the
allegations of Gonzales coincide with those he made in an
affidavit included among papers seeking Bradley's extradition
to New Orleans.

A check of Bureau files revealed one reference to
the name Max Gonzales which might be identical with the Max
Gonzales mentioned in the above newspaper article. This file
reference reveals that in February, 1965, former New Orleans
criminal informant, NO-1227-C-TE, who had ties with hoodlum
and vice personalities in New Orleans, was arrested by
New Orleans police officers and investigators from the Orleans
Parish District Attorney's Office and was charged with pandering.
On March 18, 1965, this criminal informant told the New Orleans
Office that he had been contacted by a Max Gonzales of the
Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office and was advised that
the District Attorney's Office had a good case against the
informant and for $2,000 it would be dropped.

We have previously reported that Garrison may have had
the wrong Bradley arrested and that instead of Edgar Eugene
Bradley the individual Garrison is interested in is Leslie Norman
Bradley. The latter individual is a former airline pilot who
has described himself as a “soldier of fortune." In August, 1960,
Leslie Norman Bradley was sentenced to a ten-year prison term in
Cuba on a charge that he took part in a plot against the Castro
regime. Leslie Norman Bradley was released from a Cuban prison
