; INTERNAL SECURITY - RUSSIA

In accordance with your request, the followikeoetlanations i
are submitted with regard to my participation in the captioned case:

1. Why I did not review the complete file during the period 10-10 i
to 11-22-63:

During this period the work on my desk was extremely
heavy. The publicity on the Jack Edward Dunlap case broke in the
newspapers on 10-10-63 and for the next 3 or 4 weeks a major portion
of my time was involved in handling that case. In addition, the Special
Espionage School which began on 10-14-63 required thet I lecture or |
lead discussions for 13 hours during the 2-week school. - This i
required considerable preparation. an

dealing with Soviet espionage activities in Mexico fend Canada) was,
assigned to. me and an effort was made to become-ac fend Can h “he |
many of these-as possible as well as handling the normal mail on the
other cases assigned to me (total case load approximately 95), and e| ;
Tandle the other duties on my desk which includes review and approval i
of signature mail in the Officials Unit of tenet

When the teletype from CIA date ii
do not recall if I made a preliminary review o
the teletype for the file. In this connection

Memo for Mr. Gale
Re: LEE HARVEY OSWALD
105-82555

ie first nor.do 1 know the date on which [_receiyed it. It is
noted that a new file had been opened on it and it was later changed
to this file. As indicated above I do not recall if I made a
preliminary review of the file before initialing the teletype. Again,
“it is noted that the publicity on the Dunlap case broke on 10-10-63
and that during the week beginning 10-13-63 I had 11 hours’ leaure
before the “Special Espionage School. I do not know if I received
or initialed the CIA teletype prior to recd@pt of the Legal Attache’s
cabbe and the preparation of a reply thereto. ;

ACTION

| well as the Espionage. Section. I_do not know which Section received

For information.

 

ADDENDUM: ETT: 1m] 11/27/63
I would like to add that during the reorganization of

the Division in early October, 1963, I volunteered to take

over the work involving Soviet cases in Mexico (and Canada,\ ($J

inasmuch as I already had approximately six double-agent

cases relating to those countries already assigned to me

and there appeared to be a need to correlate all of these

cases and handle them as a group.
