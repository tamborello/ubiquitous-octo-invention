classified "SECRET" unless otherwise noted. ,

This matter was predicated upon receipt of information
from T-1 that ALFREDO MIRABAL-ALVAREZ had arrived in Miami,
Florida approximately in June, 1988. He was sponsored by his
mother in entering the United States and resided with her for a
short period of time. MIRABAL-ALVAREZ departed Cuba in 1987 for
Spain where he established residency until entering the United
States. While residing Spain, MIRABAL~ALVAREZ became involved
s i TOS and his organization, -ARMANDO
C ANCHEZ¥PEREZ (Cuban official who defected
" to Spain in 1985). MIRABAL-ALVAREZ‘S father (now deceased)

served as a Vice Minister in the Ministry of. Interior until the
"microfaccion" (period of purge of numerous officials in the late
1960’s). According to T-1, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ was apolitical while
residing in Cuba. MIRABAL-ALVAREZ’S Immigration and

Naturalization Service (INS) file reflects he exited Cuba for
" Spain in approximately February, 1987, until entering the United

States on June 3, 1988 as a result of being petitioned by his

mother, who was granted United States citizenship in 1976. In

Cuba, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ’S occupation was an electronic technician

and it appears he applied to leave Cuba in 1967 and was denied

exit by the Government of Cuba because of pending military duty.

 

    
    
   
 
 

On September 11, 1990, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ was interviewed
at the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
| MIRABAL~ALVAREZ advised he arrived in the United States on June
3, 1988 through New York. MIRABAL-ALVAREZ left Cuba on February
14, 1987 for Spain, where he remained until his arrival to the
United States. MIRABAL-ALVAREZ advised that in 1980 his wife and
children were. allowed to leave Cuba for Spain, but he was not
allowed to leave because he was an engineer. Prior to his
‘ attempt to leave Cuba, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ had just concluded a trip
to East Germany for approximately 20 days in November, 1979. In
