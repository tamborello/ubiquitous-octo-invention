~. Re: John Cesar GROSSI, Aka., Unlawful

 

Flight to Avoid Giving Testimzony

Enauiries have been conducted in Ottawa
through the Department of Immigration where records reveal
that GROSSI was deported from Canada at Black Rock, N.Y.,
7 Oct. 59. At that time subject's occupation was shown as
"Habitual Criminal", therefore, he has since been barred
from Canada as an undesirable.

i,

We have established that Ottawa Tel. No.
233- 1527 is listed to Mrs. Mary A. SURRAY, 78 Fourth Avenue,
Ottawa. One, Patricia ELLIOTT, is a resident at this address
and advised our investigator that GROSSI is her uncle. Zdna
(Mrs. William) ELLIOTT, who has been previously interviewed
in Pembroke, Ont., is Miss ELLIOTT's mother. Miss ELLIOTT
stated that she contacts her aunt, Patricia BOWEN, quite
frequently at Kingston, Ont. However, she has no knowledge
; as to the present whereabouts of GROSSI. ‘le have been ;
-,, “assured that she will advise our investigator in the event
: information of value comes to her attention.
