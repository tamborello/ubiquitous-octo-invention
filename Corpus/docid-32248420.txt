Report dtd. 11/29/76 from Miami
Re: Roberto Carballo Diaz

“states 2506 Brigade is part of CORU. Action was
taken in concurrence with Directorate of Brigade 2500,
of which Armando Lopez Estrada is a part--Lopez Estrada
is military director.

Carbello says he is aware of fact that Ruiz and
Jimenez arrested in Mexico and..charged with attempt to
kidnap Cuba's Counsul in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico in
July '76. Denied any prior knowledge of this act. Would
not say who was supporting Ruiz/Jimenez. A Cuban national
was killed in kidnapping attempt.

Says he knows of an organization called FLNC but
would not comment as to its members.

Informant (2506 member) says Carballo and Armando
Lopez Estrada have aligned themselves with CORU and
other. Brigade members opposed to this cooperation with
a terrorist group and were considering challenging Carballos'
leadership.

Report from Miami . 8/25/76.

of U.S. and lived with Castro in D.R.

On 9/27/75, two bombings in Bogato, Columbia for

3.) Report from Miami, . 9/14/76. Re: CORU.

Frank Castro has formed a satellite organization to
carry out terrorist activities in U.S. In Miami the
Calandestine cell will be called Youth of the Star and
in N.Y. called F-14. Castro pointed out that terrorist
activity in U.S. beneficial to CORU must be claimed by
these secret cells, but CORU must publicly condemn these
actions. (informant info).

4.) Cable from Buenos Aires to Dir. Jan. 13, 1977. CIA
secured info that after Letelier murder, Directorate
General. of Investigations (DGI) started investigation
into activities of Orlando Bosch during his 1975 stay
in Santiago. CIA reported that Director of DINA was
instrumental in stopping the DGI investigation and
prohibiting Chilean officials from discussing case with
any Americans. Jamie Vasquez Alcaino, Director of Interpol
Section of Chilean Investigations (I.C.) reflected that
DINA director might well have briefed the President
Pinochet Bosch's connections with Chilean Air Force
Intelligence Services and that Chilean gov't. might
easily be indicted by inference with Letelier assassination.

Info. from Frank Castro re: Activities of CORU.

(a) According to official Costa Rican service, Castro

in C.R. Dec. 13-18, 197 , said he was Chief of operations

of CORU but not in C.R. to undertake terrorist acts.

CORU had a pack with Pres. Carlos Andres Perez of

Venezuela not to undertake terrorist acts in C.R.,

Nicaragua, Guatemala or Venezuela in return for safe

passage for O. Bosch in March 1976.

Bombs in San Jose, C.R. on 24 Aug. '76 were placed
by CORU Command Unit - lack of CORU coordination resulted
in this error.

Propper should request documents given by DINA
to Bolando Otero Hernandez with regard to assassination
of Luis Andres Pascual Allende in Costa Rica. Also,
Propper should get info on June 1976 CORU meeting in
Dominican Republic. m

_ One of possible motives for Letelier assassination
was revenge against Chilean government by Cuban exiles
for delivery to FBI of Otero, which was viewed by Cuban
exiles as betrayal of their cause.

Letelier's assassination may have been conceived
at June 1976 meeting. Joel Dionisio Suarez Esquivel
proposed there that each group be represented in a
military coordination group and first meeting should
be in Florida on 6/27/76 at a location selected by
Armando Lopez Estrada of 2506 Brigade. Dr. Juan Pulido
proposed that Morales be assassinated but Legat B.A.
doesn't believe it was because of his betrayal of Bosch
10 years ago--rather his betrayal of Otero.
