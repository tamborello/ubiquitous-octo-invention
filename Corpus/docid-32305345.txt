File No. : July 11, 1967

(A) ACTIVITIES OF MILITANT ANTI-CASTRO EXILES -- On several
occasions during the past six months you have been alerted to the
possibility that anti-Castro Cuban exiles in this country might travel

to Canada to attack Cuban establishments and to the possibility that
these exiles may.attempt to harm, demonstrate against, or embarrass
Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos and Prime Minister Fidel Castro if
they go to Canada to visit EXPO 67 in July, 1967, and/or to attend the
_Pan American Games scheduled to be held in the latter part of July and
the early part of August, 1967..

We have now received concrete information indicating that — \
Cuban exiles are planning the assassination and kidnapping of several
Cuban officials in Canada. KU Kw

In this connection, a New York source has reported that the
Movimiento Nacionalista Cubana (Cuban Nationalist Movement - CNM),
a militant anti-Castro group, is planning an attempt on the life of
Prime Minister Castro if he visits EXPO 67, Montreal, Canada, on
July 26, 1967, Cuban National Day at the exposition. In addition, the
, source reported that if Castro does not appear the CNM in union with the
“.. Movimiento Insurreccional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR),
another militant anti-Castro organization, plans to kidnap the Cuban
Ambassador to Canada and hold him for the ransom of nine prisoners
in Cuba who were captured during the ill-fated invasion of Cuba in April,
1961. Reportedly, the exiles intend to kill the Cuban Ambassador to
Canada regardless of whether the prisoners are released.

ORIGINAL TIT wy

The CNM is also considering the possibility of a simultaneous
action at the Pan American Games which are to be held in Winnipeg,
Canada, from July 27, 1967, to August 8, 1967. This action will involve
the kidnapping of some of the Cuban athletes participating in the games
including the Cuban Minister of Sports, Jose Llanusa, who will accompany
the Cuban team. Cpe
