ADMINISTRATIVE . . ~

PCI ROBERT GRIFFITH ‘advised on April 2, 1964, -
that it was his belief that there was no bookmaking activity
taking place at 948 Eastwood Avenue in Chicago. -He
advised that after making inquiries among his contacts
in the neighborhood, he was unable to obtain any informa-
tion which indicated bookmaking activity at.this address.
He said possibly the location was being used for an occasional”
poker game but it was his opinion that this was on a small
scale, He. also said that he had never heard the. name LEONARD.
PATRICK or DAVE YARAS mentioned in connection with this
location. He had always assumed that MAX NETTLER was in
“complete charge of the operation at that address. -
