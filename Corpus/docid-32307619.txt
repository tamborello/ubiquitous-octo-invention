MEX 105-3702 GONFIQEN THA

"OACHITA" PROENZA PROENZA DE ROJAS, ‘complained that Cuba has
become a police state and that Cuban authorities have

family "all tied up." ROJAS and his wife told [MEY 197Ehat

a Cuban communist named JUAN MARINE is a friend of the family.
On one trip to Cuba, CACHITA ROJAS asked him to look into the
situation of her sister TERESA PROENZA to see how it could

be straightened out. MARINE recently visited Mexico "incognito"
and informed the ROJAS that the situation now is extraordinarily
good but that TERESA was once under a death sentence because

she had dealt with LEE HARVEY OSWALD while assigned to the

Cuban Embassy prior to the assassination of JOHN F, XNNEDY.

Her frjend reeded for her and her life was spared. ROJAS
told (MEY comet MARINE warned them not to tell the Cuban —
Embassy in Mexico City that he had spoken to them about this
matter.

The source stated that JORGE ROJAS and his wife
do not know how to cope with the present situation. They
fear going to Cuba and they are speaking out against the Cuban
revolution in a most forthright manner. The bitterness dis-
played by ROJAS! wife far exceeds any that the source
can recall in the past.

The source stated that some years ago, as best he
could recall, he heard JUANA LUISA PROENZA, a sister of CACHITA
who died some years ago, telling a similar story of how TERESA
PROENZA was somehow involved with LEE HARVEY OSWALD at the
Cuban Embassy. At the time TERESA was employed at the embassy,
she lived with JUANA. “LUISA and another sister. Within the
family it has always been said that JUANA LUISA worried herself
to death after TERESA was ordered to Cuba.

The Mexico City Cffice has conducted a review of
references to TERESA PROENZA especially those dealing with the
CSWALD investigation and it is noted that as set forth in

xXico City let gy the Bureau 1/24/64 in. the OSWALD case
{Mey 18 and MEX Tap GS. h of whom have’ furnishéd reliable infor-
mation in the past, reported on 1/13/64 that they had conversed
with ELIZABETH CATLETT MORA, Bufile 100- 395934, who told them
of a conversation she held with TERESA ‘PROENZA, the Cultural
Attache of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico ‘City. According to
MORA, TERESA PROENZA had told her that OSWALD walked in "cold"
to the Cuban Hmbassy and the first. person he talked to was
PROENZA, Since PROENZA did not speak English, she turned him

While it is not cleat’ ifrpil ayailable information,
it would appear that PROENZA was able to return from Cuba
for a visit to Mexico following her dismissal and departure
in 1/64.

By report dated 1/14/85 the CIA reported on the in-
vestigation by the Zuban government of old line communist
JOASUIN CRSCQUI MAS. In this report it was indicated that
TERESA PROENZA had Been arrested at her home and was being
helc incommunicado.

 

A review of the foregoing material indicates that
TERESA PROENZA got into trouble with the Cuban government more
as a result of her criticism of the handling of the OSWALU
matter following the assassination of President KENNEDY than
because of anything she cid when OSWALD visited the Cuban
Embassy. er harsh criticism of nigh Cuban officials (the
Ambassador and Foreign Minister) was apparently well known
in the embassy and hardly helyed her case. It fails to :
indicate that she did anything for CSWALD that would su ntiate
the remarks made by JORGE NCJAS and his wife to/MEx 197 t
THERESA PROENZA hac nearly been executed because of her activities
during CSYALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy in 1963. In the
absence of additional information regarding this activity, no
further investigation is contemplatec at this time. it is
noted: that it is not féeasible_to ¢cirertly interrogate JOKCE
RCJAS or his wife. Sowever, /Max 19 11 closely follew this hy
matter with them and any accifional, significant developments
will be called promotly to the attention of the Bureau,

PROENZA, (MEX 127 borted on 7/5/79 that (heft recently visited Ky
the ROJAS family in Mexico City anc CACHITA remarked that
ALVARO said he was surrounded by "gusanos" (referring to
Suban exiles in a ceropatory manner) in Philadelphia.
