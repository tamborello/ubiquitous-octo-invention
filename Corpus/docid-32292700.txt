BS 92-95! .

SCIARRA has a friend who has been making i
. telephone calls from his home.telephone number hot 274.
1870. Informant believes that the individual calling from '
the SCIARRA telephone is some hoodlum from Boston or some- .
one who is connected with the Boston LCN. faction.

In August, 1973, T-1 advised that SCIARRA still “
hates CALLEI and desires his removal from the Providence, i
Rhode Island, hoodlum scene. SCIARRA is in the same
section of the ACI as CALLEI and for this reason no at-
tempts to murder CALLEI are to be made on SCIARRA's
authority. SCIARRA indicated to T-1 that CALLEI will
eventually be murdered. T-1 learned through sources at
the ACI that SCIARRA is attempting to remove himself from : 4
“the mini section into the maximum security section
. where PRO'WERNER is located. SCIARRA commented one time
LO that everyoke has deserted LERNER and he wants to continue
Va as his friend and move over to the maximum security section
where he “oyld help LERNER do his "time." T-1 advised
: that JERRYXOUIMETTE is spending a considerable amount of
4 time with CALLEI in the minimum security section of the
y ” ACI. T-1 was of the opinion that OUIMETTE might be the
individual being used by SCIARRA to set up CALLEI in a
prison killing.. T-l1 pointed out the well-known fact
that SCIARRA and CALLEI are at odds and that the prison
officials are cognizant of the threats made by SCIARRA
to remove CALLEI.

T-1 further advised that apparently DANTE
SCIARRA made the comment that the SCIARRAS have Silver
Lake, NICK BIANCO has Federal Hill and EDDIE ROMANO has
Charles Street, with regards to the control of gambling
and illegal activity, DANTE SCIARRA, brother of RUDY,
commented that the SCIARRAS, while they have Silver Lake,
would rather have Thornton, which is the district function-
ing under the control of the CALLEI faction, with BABE
PEZZO watching over CALLEI's interest in that location.

T-1 advised that FRANK AMBROGLIA from Boston
and FREDDIE BISHOP are in the SCIARRA camp and are in
contact with DANTE SCIARRA and also LUCY SCIARRA.

T-1 advised that LUCY SCIARRA has telephone
number 274-1870, and uses it in contacting individuals 4
from Boston for her husband, FREDDIE BISHOP is living with
a girl by the name.of JENNIFER.
