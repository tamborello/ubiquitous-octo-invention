mounted by WAVE.on 22 August involved a scheduled rendezvous on Anguila

' wad unsuccessful in that the two UR officials failed to make thé rendezvous -
as scheduled. WAVE is now planning ‘to rerun the operation on 30/31 ‘August. -

of the use of Anguila as a rendezvous point may possibly cause some future
embarrassment. if the{ BFitiShjshould learn of it and mistakenly associate

5. Another development, at least peripherally involving the Bahamas, |
is described below: :

a. The U. S. Coast Guard on 21 August 1962 inquired as
to any interest we might have in one W. Carney, who, in turn,
is interested in obtalning rights on the Island of Navassa,
Navassa was described as lying thirty miles due west of the
westernmost tip of Haiti, and is under Coast Guard adminis-
tration, According to TFW/PM we have looked into the island
and found it uninhabited---and possibly uninhabitable---with
no water or harbor facilities. CI/Liaisun, at our instriction,
has informed the Coast Guard that we are not sponsoring Carney,
but probably had no objection, and would like more details,

. b. Carney describes himself as a retired marine engineer,
who owns property in the Bahamas, and who takes out private
fishing parties. He wants to usé Navassa as a private fishing
resort, a refueling station, and a watering point. The Coast _
Guard has apparently reminded him that there is no water and
no harborage on Navassa, but he is still interested,

ce. The Coast Guard has an unmanned radio station on the
island. For some legal reasons they cannot sell, or-even Jease,
property on the island, but they could give Carney a five year
revocable permit, maintaining the right to inspect and approve
any construction, ,

MEMORANDUM: Chief, Task Force W

SUBJECT : British Press Speculation that DRE Raiders may
: have used British Territory as a Base

REFERENCE : DIR 32616 (OUT 70518)

This memorandum is for your information only, and
does not recommend action, Bits and pieces of infor-
mation have suddenly and recently appeared concerning
. Cuban exile activity in the Bahamas, and of equally
_ Suddén and recent probes by non-Cuban Bahamian resl-
dents, which may or may not mean something, I also

1, In response to a recent request from the London Station for
guidance in the event it is querie: concerning the DRE raid ‘on
Cuba, mainly resulting from Bri eculation that the raiders may
liave used.a secret base in the Bahamas, the Station was informed that the
DRE,. in a press conference of 25 August, said that the boats had sailed from _
Marathon in the Florida keys, and that British territory apparently was not
involved, Also that the raid was launched without our Knowledge or support.

2. In addition, on 27 August 1962, the FBI informed Mr. Wallen that
it had received an inquiry by way of its Miami field office from Mr, ‘Gregg 06 0%

 

 

< Bentley, new lead of Special Branch i thé_Bahamas}~ concerning his recent

investigation of a number of Cuban extles on the: island of Anguila who allegedly

told him they were there on a CIA mission, Mr. Béntley|claimed to be concerned 0G
‘because he would.of course have to report the mattér [rough the Colonial>24 :
Office: but would very much dislike having to do this if it was‘ actually a CIA
operation, Mr, Wallen suggested that the Bureau might inform Mr, {Bentley} 06

"that the activity was definitely not Agency sponsored, but that we might get

in touch with him at some point through n this and similar problems, 24
C/TFW, in being informed of this report, stated that he also had recently re-.
ceived the same query from th n Washington, D. C. sey :
and had also denied any Agency involvément.” The above was brought to London
Station's attention with the comment that because of coincidence and logical
placement Anguila conceivably could have been used by the raiders as a staging

area and base. “SECRET / GF —~ (/24%~2. C ; 7

d. The Coast Guard is continuing to check into Carney, and
will probably give him the permission he is seeking if they find
nothing : -derogatory on him., Although Carney is a permanent
a vésident of the Bahamas, he also has a.New York address which

H was ‘given as 655 Pelham Parkway, North, Bronx 67, New York,

6. In addition, an Agency contact, a resident of the Bahamas, who.
avels extensively throughout the islands, recently reported that he had
personally obsérved during a trip through’ the southern keys that several
“of thé keys which previously were uninhabited were now occupied by a

number of Cuban exiles, According to. source, the\British. authorities)” aa
‘apparently are puzzled'as to their presence there as is to what to do
about it.

  

7. Much of the above Indicates that a number of Cuban exiles are ul
showing up in remote areas of the Bahamas, and the British\are no. doubt
concerned over their. presence and possible CIA involvement.. Mr, (Bentleys
