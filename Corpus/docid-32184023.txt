Letter to Legat, Mexico \ t
Re: LEE HARVEY OSWALD :

_ IS + R = CUBA - |
105-82555 :

 

In paragraph 3, page 1, of re memo Mora reportedly ;
spoke of subject's “activities before his trip to the Soviet :
Union." In paragraph 5, page 1, she spoke of his activities
in New.Orleans before he went to Russia, . Subject left
New Orleans in September, 1959, for Russia after spending
a very short period of time there, No information has been
developed that he engaged in any subversive activities while ‘
in New Orleans at that time, It is possible that although
Mora spoke of Oswald's activities before he went to Russia,
that what she meant was, before he went to Mexico, This point
should be clarified. .

In paragraph 2, page 2, of re memo the question arises
as to whether it was Mora, Mora's source or the Americans in
Russia who believed that subject could not have undertaken
Singly to assassinate President Kennedy,

Although Mora is a Mexican citizen, it is possible
she will have to be interviewed eventually. Underlying all
the information she furnished as sat out in re memo, lies the
question whether she met with subject while he was in Mexico,

, Your continuing investigation of Mora's knowledge 4

ef subject should aim at answering the above questions and

your next memo should contajn these answers, You should m

your recommendations efter fgets and MEX-19]have been with (4)
Mora as to any additional investigative stéps which should fe
taken, Continue to pursue your investigation vigorously.

It is noted xe memo is classified "Secret.'' When

this memo is disseminated to the Commission questions may \.
be asked about this classification and, therefore, you should
in your next communication to the Bureau relating to Mora, q
fully detail your reasons for this classification; The Bureau
is not questioning the correctness of the classification but q

merely asking that you set forth fully your reasons for it,
