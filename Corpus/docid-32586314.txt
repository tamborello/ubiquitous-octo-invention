TP 92-1

PC stated. that the secret nature “of these con-
ferences was impressed upon the PC because at Churchill

Farms MARCELLO and TRAFFICANTE walked out into the middle

of the fields behind the main house and sat for many hours.
Likewise, at. TRAFFICANTE's home in Tampa, MARCELLO and

TRAFFICANTE sat alone in the back yard.

During - the past several weeks CARLOS MARCELLO has
stated to.the PC that the luncheon at which he was arrested .
in New York City was just. that and that he would not have
been in attendance if. JOSEPH MARCELLO had not been so slow
in packing at their hotel. -If they had left fifteen minutes
earlier than they did they would not have received the
invitation to the luncheon, MARCELLO stated that the really |
serious meeting in New York took place during the early
evening hours the day prior to his arrest and that the New
York Police would have "seen some real power" if they had
found the meeting ‘the day before the arrest, ~

. PC stated that MARCELLO ‘is worried over TRAFFICANTE
and got into trouble with the New York people over TRAFFICANTE's

actions. PC stated that TRAFFICANTE wants to come into
Louisiana, PC does not know how TRAFFICANTE wishes to come
into Louisiana; however, CARLOS MARCELLO is opposed to this,
as CARLOS feels that once TRAFFICANTE gets a foothold in
Louisiana it is the beginning of the end of CARLOS MARCELLO.
CARLOS MARCELLO. told PC that TRAFFICANTE knows “I only own
Jefferson and Orleans Parishes amd I've never wanted to own
anything else''. TRAFFICANTE wishes to come in in the rest
of the State; however, MARCELLO feels that this will be the
end of MARCELLO’ s control of Jefferson and Orleans Parishes,

~ CARLOS MARCELLO told PC that TRAFFICANTE ‘presented
several problems occurring in this part of the country to
“important people” in New York and elsewhere and created the

’

impression. that CARLOS MARCELLO was to blame for these problems.

PC stated that the problem that TRAFFICANTE used to bring

this to a head was the HASKELL JONES problem, CARLOS MARCELLO.
