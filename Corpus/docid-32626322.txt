MEMORANDUM FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF PRINCIPALS

SUBJECT: Chemical and Biological Weapons

The question has been raised as to whether the United
States should enter into an arrangement with the West Germans
under which we would furnish "standard" chemical munitions
to the West Germans in support of a SACEUR requirement for
a NATO CW retaliatory capability. Also the more basic issue
has been raised as to whether we should support SACEUR's
requirement for a NATO CW retaliatory capability. Serious
political as well as military considerations are involved
in the above issues, which raise questions concerning the
desirability.of such action by the U.S. These relate back

‘to the basic question of whether the transfer of chemical

weapons to West Germany is to the net advantage or to the
detriment of the United States.

The U.S. would be setting a precedent with the transfer
of chemical weapons to.West Germany in that we would be the

initial source of proliferation of weapons which have been

grouped with nuclear into the "mass destruction" category.
Also this country would be supplying the means for use of
chemical weapons to a country which has acceded to the Paris
Protocols of 1954 and declared that they "would not manu-
facture any atomic, biological or chemical weapons." The
problems related to the proliferation of chemical weapons,

-to previous international agreements regarding chemical

weapons, to possible conflict with U.S. policy ‘regarding
nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, should all
be assessed prior to a decision to ‘transfer these weapons
to West Germany.

In addition to the West German question there are other
problems relating to control and reduction of C/B weapons
which are presently being studied, and which require the

reappraisal of C/B weapons and policy. For example, The

Secretary of State has asked the ACDA to study the feas-
ibility of coupling a ban on biological weapons with a
constructive international program in biology and medicine.

-In a Memorandum to The Secretary of State, dated’Sept. 11,

1963, I reported the conclusion that a first step should
be a major re-evaluation of U.S. policy regarding these
weapons. It would be premature to consider this ban prior
to a reappraisal of the weapons ‘and policy. The memorandum
also pointed out the political and technical difficulties

-in distinguishing between chemical and biological weapons,

and that a reappraisal should include both classes of
weapons, particularly in.:light of prior. international
agreements.

Recommendations --

I therefore recommend that:

‘1. .The: Committee of Principals take action to
defer any decision regarding the transfer of chemical weapons
to West Germany until a reappraisal of chemical and bio-

logical weapons has been concluded.

2. The Committee of Principals take action to
initiate a reappraisal of the utility of chemical and
biological weapons and the national policy which governs
their use. :

3. The Committee of Principals request the
reappraisal be conducted by a study panel reporting to
the National Security Council and comprised of repre-
sentatives from the Department of State, Department of
Defense, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Central
Intelligence Agency, Office of the Assistant to the President

‘for National Security. Affairs, Office of. the Assistant to

the President for Science and Technology, and. appropriate

‘technical and military experts who could be brought in as

consultants; and that the panel consider all the political,
military, and technical aspects associated with chemical

and biological weapons.
