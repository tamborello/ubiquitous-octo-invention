the other racketeers feared and respected him because of his
size and cold blooded attitude. He stated that in those days
the moonshine concession in Pittsburgh's 13th Ward was run
by a man named JOE GIGILLOTTI and that LA ROCCA was only a
whiskey runner from Jamestown, N. Y. He recalled that SPINELLI
was a non-drinker who was consequently hired as a body guard
for the older three VOLPE brothers and that he had been born
and raised in Italy where he had left his wife and two children.
The informant said he knew that SPINELLI hired out as a professional
gun man and that he owned some stills in the Pittsburgh area
until he was crossed up in some manner by the VOLPE brothers
who insisted that he was simply working for them. The informant
stated that this so enzaged SPINELLI that he vowed he would kill
all three. .He recalled that SPINELEI left the moonshine joint
early.one morning without telling the informant where he was going
and that he later learned that SPINELLI had encountered the three
VOLPE brothers ating! breakfast at Bazzanno's Restaurant in
Pittsburgh's Hill District at which time he gunned them to death.
He recalled that_ARTHUR and JIMMY died with their heads in their
cereal but that JOHNNY managed to brush by SPINELLI and did not
die until he reached the gutter in front of the restaurant.

The informant recalled that SPINELLI gathered his things together
and immediately fled to New York where he encountered the brother

of the BAZZANNO who ran the Pittsburgh restaurant. He stated that
SPINELLI killed this individual with an ice pick and that newspaper
accounts from New York told how BAZZANNO was discovered with more than
150 ice pick holes and with various sections of his body cut off.

He said that SPINELLI.then fled to Italy and had nerve enough to
settle with his family in the same town in which the elder VOLPE

was an official. He stated that the elder VOLPE was thereafter
responsible for having SPINELLI sentenced to 25 years in an Italian
prison because he could not be extradited to the U. S. He recalled
that in those days numbers operations in the Pittsburgh area were
incidental to moonshine operations and that most moonshiners: carried
a numbers card plainly visible in their back pockets. He stated
that the police became interested in numbers. only when moonshine

was no. longer profitable for them,

The informant further advised that independent bookies in the East
Liberty - Homewood area are still being pressured by the Pittsburgh
Police Department and that things have gotten so bad that he has
been forced to contact his "joint" by telephone only. He added
. that even the smalier books turning into the Genovese-Nelson combine
* | run a daily risk of being raided and must take meticulous precautions
to awid detection.
