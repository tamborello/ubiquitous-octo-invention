UNOERSIGNED THE ‘THEORETICAL POSSTSILITY' THAT HE WAS A
DISPATCHES AGENT, WE STATED THAT THIS WAS CONSIOERLO EXTREMELY
UNLIKELY IN VIEW OF THE INFO Hi HAD PROVIDED. THE KGB WOULD
NOT HAVE NEEDED TO PAY “SUCH A HIGH PRICE IN COMPROMISED. AGENTS
AND OPERATIONS $F THEY WANTEO TO FEED US A PHONY OLFECTOR. WE
ALSO MADE THE UNSUBTLE SUGGESTION THAT THE KGB DION'T NEED TO SEND
us AN AELADLE TO GET INFO ON(UPHI LL INTERNAL SECURITY PROBLEMS.

3. WE REALIZE THAT THE ABOVE 1S NOT SUFFICIENT AMMUNITION
