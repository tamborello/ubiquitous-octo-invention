proposed school to be established by WODETZKI, attempts
will be made to develop informants in classes taught by
subject... ;

NYO is conducting investigation concerning some~
of the individuals mentioned in subject's notebooks and
will remain alert for the identity of anyone who eould be
developed as an informant.

of the purposes of subject's trip apparently was to contact
pro~-Chinese Communist organizations or sympathizers while.
abroad, indicating her interest in the pro-Chinese Communist

movement is 5° limited to the US, but is international in

character.

It is noted information from. CIA dated 8/27/68, .
classified "Secret - No Foreign Dissemination," indicated
party training courses for European pro-Chinese paysies and
youth groups were scheduled in Tirana on 7/30 - 8/13;

/13 - 8/27; and 8/29 - 9/13/68.: Subject, departed the US:
for Europe 8/1/68, and returned 8/15/68. u

fe August, 196, subject travelled to Europe;
she also transited’the Malprensa Airport t this time a
meeting of pro-Chinese Communist militants was held in
Albania“ Hg) u re

It fs°not known whether subject attended any of.
the meetings or whether her trip concerned them, but she
was in Europe at the time they were in progress.
