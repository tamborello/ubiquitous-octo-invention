I. RESIDENCE

On May 11, 1960, DN T-1 reported that he has
been acquainted with JAMES M. DOLAN since 1946 and that he
knew DOLAN as a con man and crooked gambler, who was con-
victed in U. S. District Court, Denver, in 1953 on charges
of impersonating a Federal Officer, as a result of DOLAN's
activities and attempting to "shake down" Denver residents
for large sums of money. Informant stated DOLAN has served
the prison term imposed upon him in U. S. District Court,
Denver, and is now residing in Dallas, Texas, where he is
reported to be an official of a labor union. Informant
stated he has had no reports that DOLAN has been in the
Denver area since he was released from the penitentiary.

On May 12, 1960, LESLIE REED, U. S. Probation
Officer, Denver, Colorado, informed SA PAUL E. BUSH that

_after being convicted on impersonation charges in U. S.

District Court, Denver, in 1951 and placed on probation,
DOLAN violated his probation and was sentenced to a prison
term, most of which sentence was served at the Federal
Correctional Institution, Seagoville, Texas. He stated
DOLAN was released on parole from that institution on
February 21, 1956, and since that time has resided in the
Dallas, Texas, area where he was under supervision of the
U. S. Probation Officer, Dallas, Texas. He stated that
DOLAN was released on parole on September 25, 1959.

It is noted that as of May, 1959, the Dallas
Division reported DOLAN was residing in Dallas where he was
office manager of the American Guild of Variety Artists.
