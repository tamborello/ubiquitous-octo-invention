zn short while and said they were traveling by air destined for

It is anticipated that bens onnel 6f “thES* office
will be initiating further tees uiries in the

Cuernavaca area and possibly may fait % direct contact
MK gee}

with the Chief of the Police there,

It is noted that Mexican Immigfration has repeatedly
assured this office that subject is "“eircularized," that is, on
their stop lists at the various ports. of entry to be denied
entry into Mexico. Yet he is almost certain to have entered
Mexico probably on Several occasions since the issuance of
the stop notice. Experience has shown that such stop notices
are not particularly effective, both because of the enormous
volume of tourists entering M €O, and because of the venality
of the Immigration agents. Y as

       

especially since the stop there was regularly re-emphasized by and feng
known to be backed by high governmental officials. Therefore it

and subsequently upon arrival at Mexico City may freely pass

to their ground transportation, It would be relatively simple
to make an "arrangement" at the Merida Airport to insure no
difficulty, and subject UL. for example, pass freely between
