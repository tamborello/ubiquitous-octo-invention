erisis, however, added\ that the/ Soviet Union’ definitely does
not want a war, He said. he heard that when. the American fleet.
was in the Mediterranean Sea, /both the American and Soviet
‘fleets were playing 'checkers/' with one another, He said that -
within the area were many Soviet submarines who were present are
“to _ challenge any undestreapil® steps taken by the United. States. @Q)6)

; Dragoic said it’ was the feeling that all action in
the’ Mid-East was under. the direction of the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA). He related there is suspicion that all of the
Jewish businessmen who’ travel the world, businesswise, are
contacts of the CIA and ‘report their impressions to that agency

instructors to Egypt. an that the Mid-East problem will.

Concerning thé question as to whether ‘the Israeli
‘victory was a setback for the Soviets, it. was felt that
pecause of this crisis and Soviet commitment to the Arabs,
they now have a green light to openly support the Arab nations...
Further, the Soviets are.in a better position to display some.
.control over ‘the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal Area — |
since when the American fieet departed the area, the Soviet.
