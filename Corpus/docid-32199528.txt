, - I. INTRODUCTION
A. The Mission Of The Task Force
1. The Problem

Qn Novenber 1, 1975, William C. Sulliven, former
Assistant Director, Domestic Intelligence Division,
Federal Bureau of Investigation, testified before the
Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations
with Respect to Intelligence Activities. He related that
from late 1963 and continuing until the assassination of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., King was the target of an
intensive campaign by the F.B.I. to neutralize him as an
effective civil rights leader. Sullivan stated that in
the war. against King "No holds were barred." (Senate
Report No. 94-755, Final Report of the Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to
Intelligence Activities, Book II, p. 11). This and other
testimony describing this F.B.I. couterintelligence
campaign against King reached the public through the
news media. As a consequence there was a regeneration of
the widespread speculation on the possibility that the
Bureau my have had som responsibility in Dr. King's
death and may not have done an impartial and thorough
investigation of the assassination.

The FBI's COINTELPRO-type harassment of Dr. King and
efforts to drive him out of the civil rights movement were found
to have been clearly improper.

Mr. Shaheen'ts report concluded that any criminal
action against FBI participants in the harassment campaign was
barred by the statute of limitations. The task force
recommended no disciplinary action because the chief FBI
officials responsible for the harassment are dead or retired,

The task force submitted recommendations for tighter
supervision of the FBI's domestic intelligence activities and
endorsed the Department's new guidelines in this area. The
task force also proposed outright prohibition of COINTELPRO-type

activities against domestic intelligence subjects.

The FBI conducted a thorough investigation of the
assasSination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a Department
of Justice task force concluded in a report released today by
Attorney General Griffin B. Bell.

The 149-page report was submitted by the task force
of the Office of Professional Responsibility following an
eight-month intensive review of FBI files and interview of
witnesses. The purpose of the study was to examine FBI
activities involving Dr. King and to evaluate the effectiveness
of the assassination investigation.

The report concluded that the FBI had conducted a ok
painstaking and successful investigation of the 1968 ,
assassination in Memphis, Tennessee.

The task force also found no evidence of FBI

complicity in the murder.
‘The only new evidence that was developed related to
details that did not affect the uitimate conclusion that James

Earl Ray was the properly =~ es

.

The task force of five attorneys and two research
analysts reviewed more than 200,000 documents from FBI
Headquarters and Field Office files and interviewed some 40
witnesses in its study of the: King case.

On April 26, 1976, then Attorney General Edward H.
Levi directed the Office of Professional Responsibility, headed
by Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., to review Department files to ,
determine:

(1) Whether the FBI investigation of Dr. King's
murder on April 4, 1968, at Memphis, Tennessee, was thorough
and honest; _

(2) Whether there was any evidence of FBI
involvement in Dr. King's death;

(3) Whether any new evidence had’ come to the
attention of the Department bearing on the assassination which
should be dealt with by the proper authorities; and

(4) Whether the relationship between the FBI and
Dr. King called for criminal prosecution, disciplinary
proceedings, or other appropriate action. .

After reviewing the murder investigation, the task
force turned to the pre-assassination security investigation or
Dr. King. The task force found that there may have been an
arguable basis for the FBI to initiate a security investigation
on Dr. King, but continued that the security investigation shouid

have been ended in 1963 and not continued until his death five

years later.
