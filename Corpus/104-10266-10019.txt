MISCELLAREOUS CPERATIORAL CATA AnD REMARKS

To the extent possible, Subject should be questioned frequent ly. 2 gard te her -

her in aboidine petential pitfalls. Guidance mist be positive and siven with)
erphasis when necessary. She should definitely not be riven any rore information ‘than
is absolutely necessary for her to accceplish the tasks assimned her.’ | Furthermore, as
Stated elsewhere, case officers selected to handle should be mature, end exverfenced -
amd should not be younrer than she. It is believed that. an experienced, fenalé case
