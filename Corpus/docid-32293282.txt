JOSEPH CIMEI were unable to find AL CIMEI ard hailed a
cab, which they rode for a few blocks, and then they
transferred to. another cab, rode another few blocks,

and took a subway. Subject assumed that they all met
at JOSEPH “iMEI's residence. After determining that

the valise contained "stock", they took the "stock" and
threw. it in Sheepshead Bay. Subsequently they learned
that the loot was not "stock" but in fact was $500 bills
in Canadian currency. They returned to the spot and
retrieved a wet, broken valise. The money was in a

- paper bag, which they had thrown in the Bay, but they

were unable to locate it.

Among the loot was also over $150, 000 in American
currency, which they split three ways. Also in the loot
were jewels which subject believes they peddled through
"Frank the Wop", owner of the Black Magic Bar, which is

‘located near. 4th Avenue and 3rd Street in Brooklyn. They

were bitter over the paltry amount they received for the -
jewels but did nothing about it.

Within two months, AL CIMEI and PHIL ARCURI |

blew their entire take at local race tracks. PHIL ARCURI
purchased a new Oldsmobile "88" at Gaynes Oldsmobile Company,

Flatbush, NY, approximately one week after the robbery.
AL CIMEI and PHIL ARCURI jointly purchased for $5,000 a
pizzeria next door to the Club 18, 18th Avenue and 56th
Street, Brooklyn; NY. Subjeet only vaguely familiar with
JOSEPH CIMEI and does not know what he did with his share
of the loot.

Several days after the robbery, she heard from

‘PHIL ARCURI that the local precinct, NYCPD precinct

(covering the Club 18 in Brooklyn), received an anonymous
letter stating that AL CIMEI and PHIL ARCURI robbed GUTERMA.

“Detectives came to the Club 18 looking for ARCURI and CIMEI.

Subject heard nothing further concerning this matter.
