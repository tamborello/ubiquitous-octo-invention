f Dear Comrade,

I was one of the fortunate group of individuals from
| Canada who were afforded the privilege of visiting your country
pleasure of meeting you-in Peking during our visit when you

and other members of the Chinese People's Government greeted
and allowed us the opportunity to present questions regarding
your country.

At that time, I expressed some concern at, what
appeared to be, excesses of the Cultural Revolution and wondered
whether some of the people who had suffered violence and abuse
at the hands of the Red Guards might not in fact be innocent.

| Your reply was that as a result of over enthusiasm it was always
i
|

possible to make mistakes, however, they would be rectified
in time.

 

; (S)
My purpose in writing is to express my concern and

that conveyed to me by a friend from NY, SUE, a loyal Maoist, and
acquaintance of yours, over the fact that recent reports have
indicated that lmg time friends of the Chinese People's Government,
ISRAEL EPSTEIN and his wife and MICHAEL SHAPIRO had been arrested
for espionage; SIDNEY RITTENBERG had been purged from his job with
Radio Peking and ANNA LOUISE STRCNG had been condemned as an
"imperialist agent." We are deeply concerned regarding the treat-
ment of these friends of the Chinese People's Government and
wonder whether the abuses which I previously mentioned are con-
tinuing in spite of your statement the mistakes would be rectified.
If these rumors are true a serious mistake has been made and we
appeal to you as afriend to intercede on behalf of the friends
of the Chinese People's Government. —

   

You can well understand my reason for not signing the
letter or identifying SUE, for to do so could conceivably disclose
our identities to the authorities.

A Friend
