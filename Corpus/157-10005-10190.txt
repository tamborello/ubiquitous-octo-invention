TOP SECRET

Wait just a minute. I am sorry.. I could be wrong
there. I said the wrong thing.

If I am going after the Bay of Pigs invasion, if
this did happen, as far as the date is concerned, after the
Bay of Pigs invasion, Edwardo did quit the operation and go
on some other assignment or what have you. So that means
he-was no longer in the Miami area. So this part I-had to
get a new case officer.

MR. OLSEN: Edwardo left Miami before the Bay
of Pigs, didn't he?

MR. STURGIS: He left after -- well, I don't know
I am sorry. Because there is a possibility that he may have
been either in Miami or he may have been in the Headquarters
in Washington. But I can't pin it down because I don't know
exactly where he was at.

MR. OLSEN: Did he ever make contacts with this man's
case officer? | COe

MR. STURGIS: No, sir, because it had to be one of

two people, it either had to be Edwardo, whom I had never met,

  
 

or it had to be possiblyfuaime Knowles, after Edwardo left.
MR. OLSEN: Did fie

MR. STURGIS: I believe so, I believe &

 

did take his place as this party's case officer.

MR. OLSEN: And then, you did not actually have any
PROPERTY OF
contact with his case officer? THE WHITE HOUSE O° F1CE
