MAGADDINO explained to LOFFA and SCIA that he helped
set up the business (narcotics) deals between JOHN PAPALIA
("JOHNNY PAPELEVO"), VINNEY MAURO ("LA MORRA") and "Rognetta

the Calabrese," while VITO GENOVESE was in jail. (Page 40)

- JOHN PAPALIA, a Canadian, is currently confined at
Lewisburg Penitentiary after a Federal narcotics conviction.

. After discussing how well he, MAGADDINO, has always
handled problems of others in the past, he began speaking of
a more familiar topic, i.e., the events that took place after
the alleged kidnaping of JOSEPH BONANNO,

MAGADDINO made reference to attempts by CHARLES BATTAGLIA
in Phoenix to contact his cousin in Buffalo. This cousin may be
SALVATORE "SAM" PIERI, a member of the. MAGADDINO "Family" who
was incarcerated in Atlanta Penitentiary on Federal narcotics
charges with VITO GENOVESE, JOSEPH VALACHI and ANTHONY CHRISCI,
aka "Tony Chris."  MAGADDINO explained that a "TONY CRISTO"’

(or CREST or CRESTA) was told by BATTAGLIA of his being unable
to. see his cousin in Buffalo. Later BATTAGLIA called his cousin
by telephone from Phoenix and the cousin reported this telephone
call to MAGADDINO, who figured that BATTAGLIA was in Arizona
with elcher JOSEPH or BILL BONANNO, .

MAGADDINO calls BATTAGLIA all sorts of names and said

that BATTAGLIA's wife was having an affair with BATTAGLIA's

brother. (Page 44)

it appears that the above concerns information previously

_reported by LA 4335-C-TE relating to BATTAGLIA's attempts to. ,

contact MAGADDINO through SAM PIERI.

.  Onee again MAGADDINO describes the events leading up
to the dismissal of JOSEPH BONANNO by the Commission. He
elaborates on his previously reported comments on this matter
particularly the apparent suicide of "MARCO ANGELO” because of
BONANNO. He also interjects the purpose of a visit of his
“prother-in-law GASPARINO" whom he has identified previously
as both brother-in-law and cousin. (Page 68) ;

PAUL SCIA adds that GASPARINO visited the United States
about twelve to seventeen years ago when the father of VINCENZINO
D'ANNA died. GASPARINO mentioned he is in all likelihood GASPAR
MAGADDINO of Sicily. : ,
