MEMORANDUM

August 1, 1975

TO: Bill Miller
F.A.0. Schwarz
Curt Smothers

FROM: Rhett Dawson

SUBJECT: Diem
The attached draft represents a short chronology and comment ;

the events leading up to the assassination of Diem and his brother,
on November 2, 1963.

 

The only remaining loose end in my mind that might need tying |

is the question of the availability of air transport for Diem on to
of his death. I believe this could be quickly cleared up if thought neces-~
sary, by interviewing or taking testimony from then Chief of Station)
ER 00w at Langley) and possibly MacGeorge Bundy. .

I would appreciate your comments and some guidelines on format for
future drafts, if appropriate.
