Re Los Angeles airtel to Bureau 1/2/62.

Enclosed are four copies of a letterhead memo
concerning information furnished by LA 4350-¢ on 1/10/62.
Due to other matters that had to be discussed with informant
and frequency of out-of-town trips,made by informant since
9/29/61, it has been administratively impossible to
discuss this case in detail with informant at an earlier
date.

In view of information furnished by the informant,
it does not appear that at this time STEIN is associated
to ag close degree with the Las Vegas operators. Los
Angeles will immediately conduct an investigation in an
attempt to develop a substantive violation of the anti-
racketeering statute relating to STEIN's reported activities
with respect to the La Scala Restaurant.
