of with pro-Castro sympathies who might have had something to do with
Torriente's death was Orlando Bosch. In July 1970 Torriente stated to
Gil that Bosch was a communist and worked for Castro. Gil read an
article in "Replica", a Spanish language newspaper published. in Miami,

The following references on Orlando Bosch Avila appear in

references pertain to Avila from 1/4/73 to 4/22/73 in Florida. He was
an exiled Cuban medical doctor, who was considering joining the PRP
since he was offered a position of leadership by the PRP leaders; but
Avila became dissatisfied with this organization because all it ever ‘
did was hold meetings and spent too much money traveling and talking
instead of fighting. Avila was former head of the anti-Castro action
group known as the MIRR, who was paroled on 12/15/72, after serving
slightly more than four years of a ten-year sentence, following his
conviction in 1968 in Federal Court, Miami, on charges of extortion,
