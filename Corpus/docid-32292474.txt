Informant learned from FRANK FRATTO that ALEX
was being reduced in stature in the outfit primarily
because he is not of Italian extraction. ALEX has held
a high position in outfit activities and has been capable.
Two years ago the outfit considered reducing ALEX's
position; however, FRANK FERRARA, who has always been
close to ALEX, prevented his being lowered in position.
In conversation with HELENE AMATO, wife of JOE AMATO,
informant remarked that ALEX was a big man in the outfit
and HELENE stated he was, but he is not any longer.
-FRATTO told informant that concerning their moving into
activities in Du Page County, that ALEX will not be in
charge of same but that someone else will be taking his
place. FRATTO indicated that informant will be placed
in a good position in connection with their interest in
that county.

- .On October 1, 1964, informant stated he had
learned from HELENE AMATO that TONY ACCARDO has expressed
a concern for what GUS ALEX might know regarding the
activities of the Italian element in the outfit. ACCARDO
and associates feel that ALEX has been extremely loyal
and capable performer for him, however, he is not of
Italian extraction and cannot be considered close to
them, They are aware that ALEX was extremely close to
FRANK FERRARA and do not know what FERRARA might have
told him regarding their activities, ALEX is. being
demoted in his position but exactly where this brings

him has presented a problem according to HELENE AMATO.

JOSEPH AMATO, that he should forget about his relation-
ship with GUS ALEX, in that GUS ALEX is being demoted

CG T-11 SA ELLIOTT W, ANDERSON
AUSA DAVID SCHIPPERS : .

ADMINISTRATIVE ;
The following information was obtained from

sources whose identity might be disclosed should this

information be set forth openly in a report:

- On September 8, 1964, and September 14, 1964,
CG 6756-C furnished information to SA JAMES D, DEWHIRST
concerning his contact with GUS ALEX wherein he stated
that ALEX visited his place of business in Lisle, Illinois,
on September 4, 1964, at approximately 11:00 a.m. ALEX
was driven to Lisle by two other individuals who remained
in the car which was a 1964 black four-door El Dorado
Cadillac, ALEX remained in his store and they conversed
for approximately three quarters to one hour. This was
his second meeting with ALEX, having first met him at
FRANK FERRARO's wake.

.According to informant, ALEX reiterated his
previous statement that informant was well recommended
and could prove an asset to their operation. ALEX stated
"they" intended to commence activities in Du Page County
in the near future and want informant to handle part of
their operation, Informant stated he would be glad to
do so; however, he did not want to jeopardize his business
and he had never been a bookie before thinking that that
would be the proposition made to him. ALEX told. him he
would be.a roving representative and not to worry about
jeopardizing his business because it represented nothing
in comparison to the financial expectancy he should get
from working with them, ALEX stated that just because
WILLIAM BAUER, the State's Attorney in Du Page County,
would be elevated to a judgeship, they were not moving
into the county but that the main reason was that "they"
had determined that there was enough action in that county
which would justify their moving into same.
