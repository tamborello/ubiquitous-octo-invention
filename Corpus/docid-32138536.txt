PERSPINSGERVAIS, PCI and former investigator for the
Parish of Orleans, advised that GARRISON is obsessed with the
investigation into the assassination of President KENNEDY.
GERVAIS stated he told GARRISON to forget the matter and he
would not assist GARRISON in the investigation and was not
interested in anything GARRISON was doing in connection with
this investigation. He stated he has no knowledge of what
GARRISON is attempting to prove and the only contact he has
had with the investigation has been a call he received from
DAVID FERRIE, He stated that FERRIE has been trying to get
him, GERVAIS, to arran n interview with GARRISON, which

assassinating President KENNEDY.

NO 1203~C advised that IVON had in his possession
a copy of the Warren Report which reflected an interview in ~
Dallas by the Warren Commission of a woman by the name of:
