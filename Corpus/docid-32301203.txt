on 2/2/62 Departmental Attorney WILLIAM KEHOE, currently
conducting a FGJ in Pittsburgh to inquire into the activities
of the MANNARINOs and their associates,

He has heard that DANIEL HANNA, aka Speedo, who was convicted
for his participation in the case captioned "STUART SUTOR,

It is KEHOE's feeling that HANNA, if he were so inclined,

KEHOE feels he should be interviewed with this purpose

When HANNA was arrested during the IRS raid on the MANNARINO
horse room-gambling casino on 6/24/61, KEHOE noted that .

ow Government until he was brought into the Federal Building,

SA FORSYTH go to Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg,

to conduct the interview, rather than have it conducted
by a SA from the Philadelphia Division, because SA FORSYTH

is thoroughly conversant with all aspects of the MANNARINO
investigations and has established a speaking relationship with
HANNA which now might prove effectual in persua@ding HANNA

to cooperate. -

It is noted that KEHOE indicated that he might have a "deal"
to offer HANNA should HANNA decide to cooperate with the
Government against the MANNARINOs. At this juncture, KEHOE
was advised that SA FORSYTH could not take any part in.
discussions concerning any deals and didimt even want to hear
the nature of thé inducement KEHOE would offer HANNA.

KEHOE was advised that if Bureau permission was. received,

SA FORSYTH would welcome an opportunity to talk with HANNA
and would bend every effort to persuade HANNA to cooperate,
but SA FORSYTH could not relay any message concerning a
"deal." KEHOE was told that any such message

would have to ke gotten to HANNA by some other means and
KEHOE replied that he understood and would, at the

appropriate time, make his own arrangements.

Bureau permission is therefore requested for SA FORSYTH
to travel to Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pa., and
to interview DANIEL HANNA. -
