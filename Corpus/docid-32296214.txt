RE: GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka.

: AR On
SAMUEL NNARINO, aka.

on 6/15/61 PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G@. FORSYTH, IIT:

The area of Monroeville, Pa., along U. S. Route 22, is now
commonly referred to by gamblers from New Kensington, Pa., so
and from other sections of Western Pennsylvania as "The Strip." i
The reason for this is that much of the highway commerce is made
~ up of nightclubs and cocktail lounges, usually operated in

connection with a motel. These places have become hangouts and }
estensibly casual meeting places for racket figures, large and i
small, and the MANNARINO underlings and associates are frequenting
these establishments more and more. GABRIEL MANNARINO shows up: once ©
or twice a week, and SAM MANNARINO appears. leas frequently. Princi i
among the places visited are the Holiday House, the Town House and i
the Phoenix Motel. \y

 

 

 

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS. ON
