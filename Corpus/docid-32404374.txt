Dear Mr. Alcorn:

This letter responds to your request of March 1, 1994,
reiterated in letters dated May 6, 1994, and January 11, 1995,
that the Central Intelligence Agency reimburse the Assassination
Archives and Research Center (“Center”) $3,744.00 to cover your
services after the Agency requested from James Lesar permission
to retrieve and replace certain documents in which it had
inadvertently released the name of a former human intelligence
source. In the end, it ‘was determined that the information was
no longer reasonably retrievable due to widespread dissemination
and all documents were returned. We regret that we are unable to

.xveimburse the Center.

You cite in your January 11, 1995 letter the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) as authority for CIA to reimburse the
Center for your fees. As you-know, our request to the Center was
not made in the context of a FOIA lawsuit. While the documents
had been released to the Center as part of a settlement agreement
of a FOIA litigation, no litigation ensued or was necessary for
the Center to respond to our request. The Agency advised
Mr. Lesar and then you that it was concerned for the personal
safety of this person and his family. The Center chose to seek
your services in responding to our request.

-Please contact me at (703) 874-3105 if you have any
questions. ; -

Sincerely,

- Addressee
