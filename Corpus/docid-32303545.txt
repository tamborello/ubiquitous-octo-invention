this five per cent he would probably be required

to give the MANNARINOs a total of about three per |
cent; this three per cent would be paid "legitimately"
by check to various individuaks for consulting feés,
Salaries, etc. Informant was questioned as to anything
in addition to obtaining the contract that the
MANNARINOs would be-.doing for him, and he advised he
would be orally guaranteed no labor problems, and
a-limited number of .inspections by the architects

anYor ‘government-inspectors,

CV 646-C stated he does not think he would
go through with the "deal" and make a bid as he feels
that. this type of "deal" is too risky and that the
only persons to gain are the MANNARINOs, and should
he, himself, suffer a loss, they would not reimburse

a

Informant was questioned as to any further
obligations he would have with the MANNARTNOs supposing
he would enter into the contract, and woultimake éven
more than the net of five per cent, and he advised
he would have nothing further, and’ would ‘only~have to
abide by the terms of the "contract" with the MANNARINOs
for this particular job. .

At the time informant was questioned as to
any friendship between the MANNARINOs and/or GIORDANO,
with DOMINICK MALLAMO of Youngstown, and he advised ~~
that when he arrived at the Town&County Motel on 1/10/67,
and before they entered into a discussion about the
"contact," GIORDANO inquired of informant as.to the
health of MALLAMO, and wanted informant to make certain ©
that he carried GIORDANO's personal greetings to MALLAMO,
In view of this, informant stated he knows there is
close friendship among the group,

MANNARINO asked him whe ther or not he might be
interested in the construction as a general contractor,
and he advised him that he might, but when he heard

he would have to make his bid by 1/19/67, he told
MANNARINO that this was not sufficient time for him

to get his bid together, and ‘MANNARINO *ttotd him at the
time that the bidding period would be extended to
1/26/67. ; ns

On 1/16/67, CV 646-C advised he had received

company east @ the Mississippi River who had been
invited to bid. Informant was questioned as to what
MANNARINO would be able to do for him should he be
interested in bidding, and he advised that should he
desire to bid, although he does not think he will
place a bid for the construction, he wouldffill in all
of the information on the forms, except the total
amount of his bid. Then.on the day the bids’ are opened
in Washington, D. C., after all the bids were open,
he would receive a phone call and would be told the
amount of the lowest bid. At this time he would have
to make his final decision as towhether or not he wished
to bid for an amount, a few thousand dollars lower: than
the. lowest bidder, and the person, name unknown to
the informant, would then write in informant's bid
on the form, and he would be awarded the bid on the
basis of he being the lowest bidder.

Informant was questioned further as to the
construction and he advised that the current plan is
to construct a high school and a residence "complex"
of about 134 buildings, each containing four apartments.
He was questioned as to what amount of money would be
involved. in a payment to the MANNARINOs for their getting
the bid for him, and he advised as follows: He stated
that if the lowest bidder was a legitimate bidder who
had thoroughly checked out all costs of the construction,
then the job should walize a net of five per cent; of

Will continue to follow and report activities
of subject and his associates in accordance with Bureau
instructions.

ADMINISTRATIVE

While the period of this report is slightly longer
than desirable, it is entirely due to an almost complete lack
of activity on the part of subject.

It is noted that it has been reported previously
that the MANNARINOs were alleged to have a contact in the
Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, D. C., who could see
to it that certain contractors BOE the contracts to build
/67, Cleveland Division advised:

On April 14, 1967, CV 646-C was recontacted, and
he advised he had been unable to ascertain name of contact
of MANNARINO brothers, employed by the Bureau of Indiana
Affairs. Informant advised he has been recently contacted
py JOSEPH "RED" GIORDANO, "go-between" man for the MANNARINO
brothers, and advised there is another construction project
coming up for bid on an Indians Reservation, somewhere in the
State of Arkansas, and GIORDANO advised informant that he ~
will recéive the plans for this work in the near future.
Informant stated he“does not. know any further details at this
time, but stated the job will be for petween one and two
million dollars, and after he has had a chance to study the
plans and before making his bid, Unknown Subject, employed
by the Bureau of Indians Affairs, is allegédly coming to Youngs-
town at which time he will discuss the job with informant.

cv 646-c advised that GIORDANO is the "eo-between"
between he and the MANNARINO brothers, and also between

the MANNARINO brothers and the Unknown Subject employed by
the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

f

; cv 646-C stated. that GIORDANO continues to frequent
the Town and Country Motel, with restaurant and bar, Route 422,
Warren, Qhio. He stated GIOBDANO has moved into the Warren
area, as apparently ANTHONY?/DELSANTER has been ‘unable to
handle racket matters satisfactorily in the Warren area.
Informmt stated no doubt it was DELSANTER who hilped GIORDANO
locate a home in the area, whee he currently resides.

cv 646-c stated that just recently he was desirous
of locating GIORDANO and was unable to do so in the Warren
area, stated "I had to call way over to New Kensington (Pa.)
to get the number," and furnished Warren phone 898-4741,
an unlisted number, as the residence of GIORDANO.

: 7 ; On April 14, 1967, it was determined that Warren
phone 898-4741 is an unlisted phone in the name of ARTHUR
of HaKKS , 2620 Risher, S. W., Warren, Ohio, a residence.

cv 646-c was recontacted on April 14, 1967, and
he advised that he does ‘not know the name of ARTHUR MARKS,
but this was the.telephone number he received as the home
phone of GIORDANO. oe .

The Warren City and Telephone Directories and
the Haines Youngstown-Warren City and Suburban addressakey-
telokey directory failed to list either the name of ARTHUR
MARKS or the address of 2620. Risher, S. W., Waren.

It is again to be noted that this is extremely
sensitive information, and it would still appear that no.
active inquiry be made in Washington so that the informant
will not be placed in a compromising position. Continued
contacts will be made with the informant, and when positive
information is developed, the Bureau and the Pittsburgh
offices will be advised. . :
