NOTE FOR: John F. Pereira @ OA
_ FROM: Fenton Babcock: Y:
DATE: 02/24/95 11:46:13 AM
SUBJECT: ARRB Proposed interpretive Regulation
a. me in sending this response to your invitation to comment on the subject document. We have focused Particularly on
sul 2 (nage 3) and 1400.7 (page 4}.

The requirement therein for release of all materials that contain names, cryptonyms, code names, pseudonyins, and aliases needs some
qualification consistent with the OCf's responsibility to protect assets of continuing national security value, liaison equities, and privacy
of U.S. citizens.

Beyond the above statutory concerns of the DCI, there is one that seemingly should be countenanced by the ARRB as a prospective

administrative burden o on the CIA. That is the likely flow of Fola requests from full release of such identifi cation detail,

Why cant these considerations be recognized in the ARRB document as proper subjects of productive, responstie 6 jalogue with the CIA?
