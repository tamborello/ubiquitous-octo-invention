departure that he intended to travel to Spain. ( the
Spanish National Police in Madrid, Spain was alerted

Spain and data concerning the background of ALEX was
furnished to them. However, at no time was the Spanish
Mational Police able to develop any information in-

reea ne that ALEX was in Spain during June and July,

IV. MISCELLANEOUS

CG T-1 advised that one of the first
items of business of ALEX upon his return to Chicago
on July 23, 1968, was to arbitrate differences which
had arisen during his. absence: between Chicago attorney '
GEORGE BIEBER and ALEX's associate in organized crime,
FEEEX "Milwaukee Phil" ALDERISIO. The informant
noted that BIEBER fears that he is about to be an
prosecuted by the United States Attorney's. Office
and that ALDERISIO in return for a monetary con-
sideration guaranteed to BIEBER that he would not .
be prosecuted. The informant was unable to furnish
any information or further details indicating the
methods to be employed by ALDERISIO in his protection
of BIEBER in this regard.

 

Information has been received from the

Swiss Federal Aliens Police on July 9, 1968, that

y ALEX's appeal for a revocation of the WSwiss Entry
Ban against him had recently been denied and that
ALEX had no further recourse to have this ban
canceled. It is noted that the Swiss Government
banned ALEX from entry of Switzerland for ten years
approximately three years ago. Since that time
ALEX has made several efforts to have this entry
ban against him lifted.
