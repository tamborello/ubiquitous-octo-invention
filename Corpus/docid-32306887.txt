a The Miami Office communication dated 9/27/73,
\mentioned in paragraph 3c of referenced CIA letter enclosure, |(K U)
contained information obtained by aHFRANCISCO VARONA from

Directorio Revolucionario (DR) member MERCEDES ROSELLO. This -
information was to the effect that subject, former Cuban

Ambassador to France, had been living in Paris, France, since

1971 and would have been used by the DR as a technical advisor

in proposed terrorist activities in Paris. Miami has been ;:

unable to locate VARONA for re-interview regarding this -

ROSELLO information. Miami deems interview of ROSELLO, the
original source of, the information, inadvisable as she has only’
been ostensibly cooperative during past interviews and could

deduce that the contact was based on information she furnished
VARONA. At any rate, the comments by ROSELLO were not well-

based. Available background information for subject does not .
indicate that he was ever Cuban Ambassador to France. Further, .
according to CIA information, subject has resided in the United
States, not France, since 1971. The comments of ROSELLO.

regarding subject were obviously, speculative.
