WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY INVESTIGATION?

The LIENVOY transcripts record a series of
discussions about the status of the November 22, 1963
Cubana flight-- when it arrived and when it departed.
The transcripts show that the flight arrived at the
airport at 1620 hours (All times used will be Mexico
City time to avoid confusion) Mexico City time. (HSCA
Staff Review of November 22, 1963 LIENVOY transcripts)
Prior..to the arrival of the aircraft, one person ::
stated that the aircraft was due at 1630 hours and
"it will go" at 1730, suggesting a quick turnaround
that would have reduced unloading and loading time,
as well as servicing toa relatively short period.
(ibid) However, the key report on the departure of
the aircraft was a statement at 2040 hours that
the aircraft had departed for Cuba five minutes
earlier, i.e., 2035 hours. (ibid)

DIFFERENCE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND HOUSE
SELECT COMMITTEE .ON ASSASSINATIONS FINDINGS

The House “Select Committee on Assassinations
findings differ from those of the Senate Intelligence
Committee in the following manner:

a) The Cubana flight was on. the ground in Mexico
City for a total of four hours and about ten minutes.

It was not delayed five hours as reported in Book V.

HW 53030

 

b) The Cubana flight departed at 2035 hours

Mexico City time, 55 minutes ahead of the alleged
arrival at 2130 of a private flight with a secret
passenger..

c)The 2035 departure also contrasts further with the
Senate Intelligence Committee Report thatthe: Cubana

flight departed at 2200.

No record of a November 22, 1963 twin-engine
aircraft carrying a lone passenger exists. In addition,
no record exists of a passenger traveling to Havana
in the pilot's cabin « ? In.view:.of the surveillance
coverage of the Cubana flight, it is doubtful that
the alleged activity involving the private twin-
engined aircraft and passenger would have gone unno-

ticed or unreported had it occurred.

WERE THE RESULTS OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY FORWARDED TO THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE : :

?

The Central Intelligence Agency gave the
Senate Intelligence Committee only the informant
allegations. The Senate Intelligence Committee
did not review the LIFIRE or LIENVOY records. Relying
solely on the informant's allegations, the Senate
Intelligence Committee could not have reported the

story any differently.

NOVEMBER 22, 1963 CUBANA FLIGHT

Book V of the Senate Intelligence Committee
Report refers to a reported five-hour delay (6:00PM
EST to 11:00 PM EST) of a Cubana flight from Mexico
to Havana the evening of President Kennedy's assas-
sination, November 22, 1963. (Senate Intelligence
Committee Report, April 23,1976, p.30) The most
intriguing aspect of the report was that the alleged
delay was to await arrival at 10:30 PM EST of a pri-
vate twin-engined aircraft, which deposited an uni-
dentified passenger who boarded the Cubana aircraft
without customs clearance and traveled to Havana
in the pilot's cabin. (ibid ps. 60 -61) The Senate
Intelligence Committee wrote that the Central, In-
telligence Agency "had no information indicating
that a followup investigation was conducted to deter-
mine the identity of the passenger and had no fur-
ther information on the passenger, and no explan-
ation for why a followup investigation was not con-
ducted." (ibid p.61)

The Senate Intelligence Committee Report
raises four major Questions:
a)Did the Central Intelligence Agency write the
Senate Intelligence Committee that no investigation

of the November 22, 1963 Cubana flight was conducted?

b) Did the Central Intelligence Agency further inves-
tigate the allegation?

c) What were the results of the Central Intelligence
Agency investigation?

d) Were the results of the Central Intelligence
Agency investigation forwarded to the Senate Intel-

ligence Committee?

In an attempt to answer the questions raised
by the Senate Intelligence Committee Report, the
House Select Committee on Assassinations has done
the following:
a)Conducted an extensive review of the Central Intel-
ligence Agency files that pertain to the November
22, 1963 Cubana flights.

b) Reviewed Tab B of the 1977 Cia Staff Report which
included a section on the November 22, 1963 Cubana
flights.

c) Reviewed the February 4, 1976 Central Intelligence

Agency letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

DID THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY WRITE THE
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THAT NO INVESTIGATION .
OF THE NOVEMBER 22, 1963 CUBANA FLIGHT WAS CONDUCTED?

After a careful review of the February

4, 1976 Central Intelligence Agency letter to the

AW 53080 DocId:32271789 Page 3

p.2
AW 530380

Senate Intelligencé Committee , the House Select
Committee on Assassinations has determined that the
Senate Intelligence's interpretation of the letter
is misleading. The Central Intelligence Agency wrote
the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Mexican
authorities were asked about the reported flight
delay, although there was no recorded response. (CIA

letter to Senate Intelligence Committee, 2/4/76)

DID THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY FURTHER INVESTIGATE
THE ALLEGATION?

The. Central Intelligence Agency conducted
regular surveillance of Cubana flights, filing cable
reports to Headquarters. (1977 CIA Staff Report, Tab B,
p. 11) There was one unilateral CIA surveillance team
that observed. arrivals and departures of Cubana
flights, reporting any unusual incidents and providing
copies of flight manifests. (ibid, p.11) ‘The Mexican
authorities also had a surveillance team of its own

at the airport which provided the CIA with photo-

‘graphs of passports and copies of passenger lists.

(ibid p.11) Additionally, a telephone tap operation
(LIENVOY) against the Cuban Embassy provided trans-
cripts of conversations with the Cubana office and

the Mexican Airport Control office.
