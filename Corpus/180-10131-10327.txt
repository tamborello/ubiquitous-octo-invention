Mr. Goldsmith. You have read the letter?

Mr. Phillips. I have, sir.

Mr, Goldsmith. And do you understand the letter?

Mr. Phillips, I understand it, It gives me complete

freedom to discuss things despite my secrecy with the agency.

Mr. Goldsmith. So that you would be obliged to testify
fully and truthfully before this committee. x

Mr. Phillips. Absolutely.

Mr, coldsmith. Mr. Phillips, is it true that, it ig
agency policy for ease officers, for example, to have
pseudonyms?

°

Mr. Phillips. Yes. Of course all case officers have

| a pseudonym,

Mr. Goldsmith. Will you explain to the committee what
the purpose of that pseudonym would be?

Mr. Phillips. A pseudonym is used so that on records

i such as pay papers, all sorts of records that go back and

forth in a peuchin cable traffic you can refer to a person

| without actually. using his true name. It is a registered

|

thing that a person keeps throughout his career unless for

some reason it is blown, unless it becomes known publicly,

2 dn which case the pseudonym is changed.

Mr, Goldsmith. Would the pseudonym also be used by a
case officer when the case officer contacts an agent?

Mr. Phillips. Very rarely. I don't know that anyone

Mr. Goldsmith. So you would distinguish between a
pseudonym and an operational alias, ‘is that correct?

Mr, Phillips. Absolutely.

Mr. Goldsmith, What was’ your pseudonym while you were
at the agency?

Mr. Phillips. I havé two. My last one was Michael c.

Mr. Goldsmith. And what was your earlier one?

Mr. Phillips. Paul D. Langevin.
