Cuban Exile Activities

On January 28, 1960, PSI MIGUEL ANDRES DE LEON ROJAS
reported that responsible Cuban exdle groups,-in Mexico City and
the United States, who have supp ed Dr. LILO 2 PORTUONDO,
are convinced that General JOS ERIQPPEDRAZSAACABRERA, who
commands a group of Cuban military exiles in the Dominican
Republic, would not be a wise selection as the military leader
of-the attempt to. overthrow the CASTRO government. The PSI
further acipcea, hat these Cuban exile groups believe that
PEDRO LUISADIA Z, former Chief ofthe Quban Air. Force,
would be a much better military leader. (&' AW ,

The PSI also advised that information received from .
sources within Cuba reflected that FIDEL CASTRO had prepared a
decree ordering the United States to vacate the Guantanamo
Naval Base. According to this information, the decree was
originally prepared in late November, 1959, but had not yet
been signed for issuance, ayes rb

The PSI further uae at he had heard reports in
Miami, Florida, of an invasion a pt which allegedly would
be made by supporters of ROLANDO SFERRER,! a Cuban exile who
resides i ami, The PSI, stated that MASFERRER, ROBERTO
APERNANDEZ DA, NO OTHMAN, and their associates form a
group which is not regarded in a favorable light by responsible
Cuban exiles or by responsible elements within Cuba. The PST
stated that from the information available to him in Miami he
doubted very much that MASFERRER would be able to make an
attempt at invading Cuba or, if an attempt were made, that it
would be successful. (&) )()

 

invade Nicaragua. This source advised that approximately 400
guerrillas have been trained to make up the invasion force.

The PSI stated he had received no information as to the timing

of such an attempt, but expressed doubt that it would occur in
the immediate future in view of the concern of the Cuban Govern-
ment over a possible early invasion attempt by Cuban exiles. (94(4)

countries who are bound together not only by historical ties

SIQUEIROS made a statement to the press wherein he criticized
the President for not accepting a bid to visit Cuba and stated
that President LOPEZ MATEOS was merely laying the ground work
for a subsequent visit by President EISENHOWER. LOMBARDO was
critical of President LOPEZ MATEOS in certain respects,
particularly in connection with the imprisonment of the
railroad strike agitators and PCM and POCM leaders,
