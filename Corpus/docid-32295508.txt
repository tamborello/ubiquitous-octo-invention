PH 92-1027

VINCIGUERRA) operates YOYO's Bar, 15th and Dickinson Streets, i
Philadelphia, Pa. On 10/4/63 PH 540-C advised that "yoyo" : :
operates Cabana Steaks, 2152 South Dorrance Street, Philadelphia,

Pa., and YOYO's Bar, 15th and Dickinson Streets, Philadelphia.
According to this informant, a "queer" by the name of NORMAN :
works for "YOYO" at Cabana Steaks, 2152 South Dorrance Street,
Philadelphia. . j

On 10/4/63 PAUL RUST, Radio Station WIP, Philadelphia,
advised that WIP has not had any additional contacts from
anonymous letter writer or anonymous telephone caller. RUST :
is of the opinion that the anonymous telephone call. he received
on 3/28/63 was a "prank" and not made by same person who wrote
the anonymous letter. f

It appears that the presence of the vehicle bearing
Pennsylvania license 704-65P at Independence Square at 5:30 a.m.,
10/1/63, had no bearing on instant matter. This area is known i
to have some "queer" activity, which would account for this :
vehicle being in the area. .

RUST of WIP will advise this office if any additional

contacts are made at WIP. The Bureau will be advised of any
additional developments if and when they occur.
