le Mr. Lloyd TRULL, 281 King St., Kingston, Ont., Vice-
Principal, Kingston-Collegiate-and Vocational Institute was
anterviewed and he advised that he was aware of the facts
surrounding Mrs. Patricia BOWEN'S husband. Mrs. BOWEN is:
presently on the teaching staff at’ Queen Elizabeth Collegiate
and Vocational Institute, Kingston, Ont. being the head of the
Classics Department. TRULL advised that Mrs. BOWEN was a.
close friend of Mr. Vernon READY, former Principal of Kyngston
Collegiate and Vocational Institute. In the summer of 1964
the READYS moved to London, nt. and since this time Mrs. BOWEN
has been in constant contact with Mr. TRULL. He also advised
that he had been introduced to John GROSSI, who was using the
name Jack BOWEN, during the summer of 1964. This took place
at the home of Vernon READY: where the BOWEN'S were visiting.
Since the READYSShave moved from the Kingston area Patricia
BOWEN has been a close friend of Mr. TRULLS and it would appear
that she would confide in him should her husband contact her or
have any of his friends do the same.

26 TRULL aslo advised that Mrs. BOWEN 1s residing at 36
Ellerbeck Ave., K,ngston with her two year old son and her
‘mother, who babysits while she works. She is highly regarded
as a teacher by her superiors and there its no indication that
she is involved with her husband in any way. She associates
with a small group of personal friends, these being mostly
fellow teachers. It was also mentioned by TRULL that Mrs.
BOWEN would proceed with divorce action should she be able to
get in contact with her husband.

3e William TATTON, 34 Ellerbeck Ave., Kingston, Ont., Classie
fication Officer, Kingston Penitentiary, who is well known to all
members of this detachment, was interviewed in regards to the
possibility that he had noticed an American car in the vicinity
of 36 Ellerbeck Ave. He advised that he could not recall. any
such vehicle in the last few months but stated that he would.
notify this office should he notice anything that might indicate
that GROSSI was in the areae TATTON also faintly remembers
GROSSI as an inmate at Kingston Penitentiary.

 

4, From the results of this investigation 1t would appear

that Patricia BOWEN is no longer interested in or corresponds
-with_her-husband-and-would- therefore not -be-involved—in his ———.—
activities or his friends. There is every indication. that
should GROSSI return to this area and contact his wife she would

advise TRULL of same, TRULL 18 cooperating to the fullest
extent with this Force.

CON'T. FROM PAGE ONE

5e No enquiries were made at Patricia BOWEN'S present
Place of employment as TRULL indicated that a very limited
number of people know about her husband and it may cause
embarassment for her should too many find out. It will

be noted that TRULL has helped members of this detachment in
the past and at all times has supplied good information. No
further enquiries will be carried out at this point, however,
should information in this regard come to light same will

be reported. : ;
