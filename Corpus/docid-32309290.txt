for MEI. Clayton had many contacts in Central and South
America, and was fluent in English, German, French, and
Spanish. In 1958 Clayton traveled primarily in Mexico,
Jamaica, San Juan, and Caracas. In 1959 his travel was pri-
marily confined to Central and South America, but in both
1958 and 1959 Clayton made at least two trips to Europe. In
connection with matters handled by Clayton at MEI, it was
subsequently discovered that there were i

in the files supposedly originating from LLL

President of MEI, requesting that Clayton travel to Europe,
Mexico, San Salvador, Costa Rica, and Honduras. It was also
noted that some of the incoming correspondence to Clayton/at
MEI from Europe was incoherent on its face and presumably
was in code.
JFK Act 6

Clayton continued in the employ of MEI until
September 15, 1962 when he formed a company entitled Pan-
American Council for Engineering, for the purpose of servicing
MEI accounts on a contract basis. This company was believed
to be a partnership between Clayton and a fictitious person
and was registered in Cook County, Illinois.

In 1960 Clayton had brought a friend by the name
of P, Maktos to MEI in Chicago. Maktos, an alleged
attorney from Cleveland, Ohio and Boston, Massachusetts, was
accompanied by Dominick Edward Bartone, with whom Clayton also
was acquainted. Bartone discussed with MEI officials the need
for anengineering survey of NCS in Canada. MEI conducted the
engineering survey and subsequently there were two or three
meetings in MEI's Chicago office regarding financial diffi-
culties of NCS. Present at these meetings were Clayton,
Bartone, Maktos, James Ganoom, Gregory Pahules, and Meissner.

Clayton claimed to be acquainted with Ben Cohen,

Tommy Cohen, Sam Kaye, Ben Dranow, Lou Poller, Bennie Hussick,
Dave Yaras, and James Hoffa. This acquaintanceship resulted
from an alleged'loan from the Teamsters Pension Fund to Tommy
Cohen, from which Hoffa, Maktos, and Clayton were each
supposed to have received a $50,000.00 "kickback". Clayton
received $2,500.00 by wire regarding this transaction from
Maktos. Hoffa was interested in Clayton because of his
political background and the fact that he was "of counsel"
for the firm of Javitz and Javitz in New York. Hoffa allegedly

wanted Clayton to contact "Fuller Warren and Pepper'! in an
attempt to form a strong political team to fight "Bobby"
Kennedy.

Clayton reportedly also was friendly with or did
business with many prominent individuals in various parts of
the United States and other countries, including businessmen,
industrialists, public officials, and politicians.

Clayton appeared to be knowledgeable in the field
of foreign banking and claimed to have opened bank accounts
in Mexico City and in Switzerland for various individuals,
On at least one trip to Europe, Clayton reportedly was
carrying at least $50,000.00 in cash for deposit in one of
these accounts. In regard to Clayton's banking connections
in Switzerland he reportedly was in contact with Dr, Nicholas
Bar, Julius Bar and Company, Vahnhofstrasse 36, Zurich,
Switzerland. To conceal some of his financial transactions
Clayton allegedly had created a non-existent person with a
name dissimilar to Clayton's, having a Post Office Box mailing
address on an island in the Bahamas, and having bank accounts
there and elsewhere. Clayton had indicated that such non-
existent persons could be utilized by making up aname, getting
a Social Security card.in that name, opening a small bank
account, and subsequently obtaining a domestic air travel card
and other credit cards.

Clayton and Bartone allegedly had obtain
a bank charter on Grand Cayman Island, British West Indies,
in 1961. Bartone had mentioned to Claytonthat "they" had
started a bank in Nassau, Bahamas, but "the feds blew it
right out of the water". Bartone claimed to be working on

"certain matters" with."Jimmy" Hoffa, and also said Grand

Cayman Island was an excellent location because he could do
business for and with the head man of the Seafarers Inter-
national Union.
