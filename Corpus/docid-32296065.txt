The Prentice Hall Tax Service Book reviewed by SA KILGORE
indicates. that the United States tax treaty with Greece

was ratified on December 30, 1953 to become effective

January 1,:°1954. The Prentice Hall Tax Service

indicates that the tax treaty with certain countries -

exempts income from rents and royalties from real property

taxation; however, Greece is not among those countries.

T-~2, who has furnished reliable information in the past,~-

on July 16, 1958, advised that Mrs. KALIOPI HAZIDAKIS,

wife of MIKE HAZIDAKIS, left New Kensington, Pa., in 1952

with her son, GEORGE, to return to Greece permanently |

because she discovered that HAZID. was having extra- ees
marital relations with Mrs. JULIAXTSANGARAKIS, age BAP Ref (97 3
approximately 45, of New Kensington. T-2 said HAZIDAKIS

has confided to him in @ past that he has been having Ch -
sexual relations with. the TSANGARAKIS woman regularly

since the late forties with the permission of her husband,

GEORGE, age approximately 65, apparently because GEORGE

has, for some time, been incapable of having sexual

relations because of his advanced age and physical condition.
According to T-2, HAZIDAKIS recently mentioned that he has _

not been seeing a great deal of the TSANGARAKIS woman for

the past year since she began dating Mayor RAYNOND@ARBROCK
of New Kensington. T-2 pointed out that it is no Secret in
New Kensington that GARDLOCK has been seen in public in
New Kensington with the TSANGARAKIS woman during the past

year. PR :

el . . : ‘
T-2 explained that TSANGARAKIS and her husband own and
| operate, a small restaurant on Constitution Boulevard in
New Kensington, have two or three grown children and have
living quarters above the restaurant.

 

Mrs. HELEN KIDO, clerk of the Credit Bureau of New Kensington i
and Arnold, on July 18, 1958, advised from records that
GEORGE TSANGARAKIS and wife, JULIA, purchased the Stanton
Luncheonette at 634 Constitution Boulevard in New Kensington
ae in October, 1955, and live in an apartment above the
' luncheonette. As a matter of background information, KIDO !
( stated that Mr. and Mrs. TSANGARAKIS formerly owned ‘the 1
Casa Blanca and International Restaurants in New Kensington |
for a number of years before buying the luncheonette in
1955 with a down payment of $5,000. KIDO added that |
CHARLES and NELLE BEACON, address unknown, of New Kensington, j
have -an $8,000 mortgage on the luncheonette. KIDO identified {
the children of Mr. and Mrs. TSANGARAKIS as MATTHEW, age 22,
and MARY, age 20. : i
