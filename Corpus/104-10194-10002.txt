Dear Sirs

 

Tris 1s a request for an extension of tire within whieh to
move ry. Kousehold effects from Marylani to a retiremert sito.
I retired at tho end of July 1963 end wy understending 1a
thal tle normal per{od ior moving to a ratirerert site is
gix ronths or until 31 January 1969 in ny case, It alao ts
my unjJerstanding that you have discretionary authority to
extent the tire, .

Ky request {a based on the eftrovnetanecea deseribed below.

Durlag sy tour of duty drnediately preceding relivement, my
rot.cr lost Ler gig..c duc te sente glaucore. On ny return
iro: oversoas li, or ley to rotire, one ot tha problons wrich
he Was bie gure of ry mother who had been living in
her ow apertment in few Jarsoy. Sho croblem became more
difvloult coincidentally with my retirement when in July my
‘mothor suftered a fall, resulting in multiple fracturas of
her lip. Sinee then abe Fag been unter tre oare of two
doctors, lest in a heapit.l seal currently in n nureing pore,
The extent to piien she will ve aoie to walk is questionnble,

 

    

Frior w :obtiring, I had planred to devote the time irmediately
after the uffective date of retirement to exploring retirorent
sites. ioe acciiart to ry mother and problems related to it
have prevented the sarvying out of my plans, I remain uncertain
about my retirerent loeation and reaching a decision derenda in
part on my nother's sontinuing need for care and upon my being
able to travel to investigate croupective retirevent sites.

I an eager to resolve the matter but it apPears rost Lasrobable
that I sinll be able to do so prior to the end of next January.
