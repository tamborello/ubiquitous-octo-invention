MEMORANDUM

TO:: Lee Matthews S.
FROM: Eileen Dinneen
DATE: June 21, 1978

RE: Secret Service cases established in 1963 involving assassinations

In reviewing the 413 computer print outs on Protective Research
cases set up during the time period between March and December, 1963,
it became evident that the Secret Service paid some attention to
foreign assassinations. Case #401 on Thelma Estella King was refer-
red to the Service by the CIA on 3/8/63. Ms. King was alleged to be
involved in an assassination plot against JFK and the President of
Panama during a meeting in that country. She was reportedly involved
in the assassination of former President Ramon of Panama and ina
plot to overthrow the government of Panama under President Robles.
Case #407 pertains to Chy Song, a military bodyguard to the Laotian
foreign minister in 1963. On 4/1/64, Song assassinated Quinim
Pholsena with 18 shots from his machine gun. Apparently the assas-
sination was well planned as the other bodyguards did not react to
the firing. The assassin's fate was listed as unknown. Case #409
involves Mohamed Khalifa, who on 4/11/63 mortally wounded his long
time friend, foreign minister of Algeria, by shooting him in the
face. The chauffer captured the subject but his final disposition
was given as unknown.

The above three cases show definite Secret Service interest in
foreign affairs. However, it is questionable as to why the Diem
brothers' assassination was not given a case number. Review of the-
files showed no mention, whatsoever, of the assassination occurring
in Viet Nam prior to the planned Chicago trip of Kennedy on November
2, 1963.
