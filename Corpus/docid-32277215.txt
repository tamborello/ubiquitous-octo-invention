| Operations Officer, Contacts Branch, named Moore -- M-o7o-r-e. |
| Mr. Goldsmith. J. Walter Moore? _
i Mr. Scelso. Something like that. |
3, Walton Moore was in touch with deMohrenschielt. It
| asserts that deMohrenschielt claimed Moore had asked him to
stay in touch with Oswald.

As I recall, I did not know that Moore had, any officer
‘of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Texas area, had been|

in touch with Lee Harvey Oswald at any time. : :

 

 

Mr. Goldsmith. My recollection differs somewhat. My
i

 

recollection of the book was that it said that Moore had been
in touch with deMohrenschielt. I do not think it went into

i any detail that Moore had been in touch with Oswald.

i Mr. Scelso. I read the book very hurriedly, and I
thought they were the same party, however, I cannot swear to
that. I just wantéd to say that I did not know that :there
had ever been any involvement between the domestic branch of

.

the Central Intelligence Agency that was then called the
Office of Operations and their officessaround the states,

: i
who interviewed American servicemen going abroad or returning
from abroad, was called the Contacts Branch. I did. not know
that anyone in that branch had ever been in contact with the
« Oswald case, whether with him personally or by requesting
people to elicit information from him, and so on.

4 Mr. Goldsmith. Does that surprise you?

questions about the Nosenko case?

‘Mr. Scelso. I suspected that I might.
1 Incidentally, the book did raise several points. in my
mind which I would like to discuss with you.

Mr. Goldsmith. Before we do that, other than the general;

 

priefing that the Agency gave you on the work of our Committee
did anyone in the Agency suggest to you that you should not
not cooperate with us? : |
Mr. Sceiso. No.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did anyone inform you about the substance

 

of other interviews or statements made under oath by Agency
employees to staff of this Committee? .

Mr. Scelso. No, except that I was told in a discussion
ofithe Nosenko case that certain people in the Agency had
-testified along one side or the other of the Nosenko case.

Mr. Goldsmith. You were not informed about the substance!
of any statements made by any CIA person to this Committee?

Mr. Scelso. No.

Mr. Goldsmith. Before we proceed, you indicated that
you would like to give us some background information or com-

| ments on the Nosenko case from the book you have read. Why

do you not take this opportunity to do that now?

 

Mr. Scelso. Well, several points struck me. As you know,

Mr. Scelso. Yes, I was.
Mr, Goldsmith. For how many years were you so employed?
Mr. Scelso. Twenty-three years.
Mr. Goldsmith. In what capacity?

i Mr. Scelso. I was an intelligence officer in the clan-

 

destine operations side of the organization.
Mr. Goldsmith. For all twenty-three years?

Mr. Scelso. Yes, all twenty-three years.

 

Mr. Goldsmith. What position did you have with the

 

Agency at the time you retired?

t]
} Mr. Scelso. At the time I retired, I was on the foreign
|

| intelligence staff in-charge of the operations branch respon-
| sible for reviewing almost all of the foreign intelligence

and counter-intelligence operations of the Agency and of

| formulating doctrine with the conduct of such operations.
ii

i I was also a member of a panel which reviewed the total

programs of the Agency abroad and evaluated them.

 

Of course, at the time of the Kennedy assassination, I
had quite another job.

Mr. Goldsmith. That was my next. question. What. was your
| position?
| Mr. Scelso. At the time of the Kennedy assassination,
I was the chief of a branch responsible for operations in
Mexico and Central America, down to and including Panama.
