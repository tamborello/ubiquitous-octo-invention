1. The attachment was passed to us by SMACT/1. S¥ABET prefers
to make their inquiry through us in order to hold down the pussibility
of @ news leak regarding Yilliam Martin's potential trip to SHADD.

The last thing the SHADDs want is for this item to hit the ayers,
SMACT/1 says the foreicn minister would prefer that no visit taxe
place. Until the latter learns sore definitively from LNUARP authori-
ties whether or not Martin would be subject to extradition be will
reply to questions - should the ;ropused visit be ieazked - that he
has “no information," Weanwhile he would appreciate receiving LNHARP
opinion as to Martin's current status in law.
