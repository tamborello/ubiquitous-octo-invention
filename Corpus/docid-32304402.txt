APPENDIX
DETAILS OF PROPOSED INSTALLATION

_ Pursuant to Bureau authority, dated February le,
1964, a survey was conducted to determine the feasibility of
effecting misur coverage on subject's private office at
the Ken Iron and Steel Company, 2263 Third Ave., New
Kensington, Pa.

The Ken Iron and Steel Company is losated in the
twelve hundred block of Third Avenue and fronts on this "
avenue, while the rear of the enclosed yard bounds on
Spruce Alley, running east-west between Second and Third
Avenues and terminating at the east end of this yard.
Residences. on poth Second and Third Avenues are telephonically

yserviced (through a lead-sheathed aerial cable traversing the
“north side of Spruce Alley from west to east, which terminates
on utility pole #19319, immediately behind the yard. Fromm
this utility pole the cable is dropped into the company's
office's cellar where it terminates in a twenty-five "protector-
paired" box, five pairs of which service the office's various -
individual t@lephone numbers. The location of this office
is approximately 16 _wire-miles fromgthe [Pittsburgh office
Consolidated Plant gy

CS PG 187-S advised that a cable-record check
‘disclosed severalline pairs which could be made available
for use. One pair was selected (Pair 847) and on testing it, ‘
measured 2,055 ohms with a db loss of 8.7 over the approximate
16 wire-miles. !

Subjectss private office ig located in the rear
northwest section of the first floor and has approximately 4
10! by 11! dimensions. The walls are pine-panel plank while :
the 10' ceiling is constructed of acoustical tile. The
groved pine-panel planks are held in place with 4d nails to
: furring strips, 24" on horizontal center. The private office
: is serviced with a five-key telephone instrument which inter-
connects, in addition, with several offices and points in
the junk yard. This keying unit obviously replaced a former
number of private-line instruments. On the north wall is
mounted a 44A block.

-It is proposed that one mike be installed in the
northwest corner of subjects! private office on the west |

wall at a height of 34" and a point 22" from the northwest

corner. Ingress to this area can be made by removing one

section of plank, two at the most. The preamp leads will be

extended behind the plank, downward and will emerge on

an the top interior west wall of the cellar and will thereafter
. be secreted to the cable outlet.

It is anticipated that the installation personnel
will enter the Ken Iron and Steel Company surreptitiously.
Prior to entry, all logical principals will be placed
under surveillance and will be surveilled during the entire
operation. Special Agent personnel who are acquainted with con
| the subjects and key associates will be placed in strategic
' . positions to provide utmost security throughout the entire
: operation to insure advance warning of any approach by the afore-
mentioned persons. It is realized that trespass will occur
but every precaution will be taken to prevent any possibility
of compromise.
