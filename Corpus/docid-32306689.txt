report SA ARTHUR V. HART, 5/21/59, Albany) that information was
‘alleged that a meeting of Italian hoodlums similar to instant
meeting was to be held in the Laurentian Mountains about 50
miles from Montreal some time after December 23, 1958. It
was also reported that Staff Inspector JOHN J. QUINN, Bureau
of Criminal Investigation, New York State Police, had
confidentially advised the Assistant Commissioner of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Ottawa, Canada, by letter
of the possibility that the meeting might take place and
suggested consideration be given that the meeting could be
at a lodge owned by GIUSIPPE TRONI, 345 EmoryStreceticnmeem

; In this connectfon it is noted that the local press
carried a brief item concerning the recent arrest of an
individual who could be identical to this CATRONI, together
with others, at Montreal, Canada, in possession of some
kilos of heroin. worth approximately $3,000,000.00. A lead is
set out to obtain further data concerning this and any
connection there may be between Apalachin hoodlums and this
Montreal ope#&tion since it has been alleged that a purpose
of instant meeting was to discuss narcotics, .
