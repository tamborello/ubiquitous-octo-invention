In instant rerort where subject has been shown
attending an SYP function, with no details given as to what
occurred at this function, Infornants’ reports do not contain
any statement made at these meetings regarding aims, purposes
and subversive character of the SWP. .

It is expected that because of the numerous activities
of this comparatively new SWP merber, that nay knowledges of
aims and purposes will be developed and when obtained, these
will be furnished in subsequent reports.
