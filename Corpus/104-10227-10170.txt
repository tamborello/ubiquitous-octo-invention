E. Wo agree with AKBUD-1's belief that the "bulletin"
should not be published. in the WAVE area and further believe
that it is a publicity arm of the group and as such should come
out\of their budvet if printed in other countries, We do not
consider this in the category of a separate propaganda project

deserving separate financing.
