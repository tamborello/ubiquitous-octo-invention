It should be noted general and Elsur indices were
searched on these individuals in April, 1992. At that time,
Sacramento file 62-34, John F. Kennedy Assassination, was
forwarded to FBIHQ. (File charged out to FBIHQ on 4/27/92).

No other records exist at Sacramento except for a
letter from an anonymous individual claiming to be the daughter
of the late President who stated she knew who assassinated JFK
and that. the person was “still very much alive”. It is enclosed
for whatever action FBIHQ deems appropriate. ;

It is unclear exactly what “archived SAC material” is,
but it is not believed that Sacramento has any.
