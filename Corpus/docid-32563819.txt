PROSECUTIVE ACTION

The facts concerning the uniform worn by subject GROSSI as related by Lt.
WILLIAM C, LASSITER, U. S, Naval Reserve, were discussed with Assistant

Ue. S.-Attorney JULIAN HARTREDGE, Savannah, Georgia, who advised that it

was his opinion also that the uniform which subject GROSSI was wearing :
was not the uniform of the U. S. Navy and that he was dismissing the charges
which had been brought against the subject GROSSE for TLlegal Wearing of
the Uniform. He stated that the Selective Service charge would be continued
against him, however.

On May 8, 19h, Mrs HARTRIDGE advised he had received information from the
Ue. Se Probation Officer at Savannah, Georgia, to the effect that subject
GROSSE is. only 16 years of age and that accordingly there was no violation
of the Selective Training and Service Act for failure to register on the
part of the subject and that. he was dismissing such charges, He stated
that the subject would be held for the New Jersey State Home for Boys and
that GRUSSI would be returned to the custody of such institution.

MR. EDWIN C. HARDISON, U. Se Probation Officer,Savannah, Georgia, advised
the writer that he had received information from the probation officials
to the effect that GROSSI is actually only 16 years old and that he
served some time for juvenile delinquency at the New Jersey State Home
for Boys at Jamesburg, New Jersey.

' Mre SCOTT A, EDWARDS, clerk, U.S. District Court, Savanah, Georgia,
_ presented court records on THOMAS HARVEY HERMAN which reflected that a

criminal information was filed by the U. S. Attormey on one count for
violation of the juvenile delinquency act in that HERMAN did unlawfully,
wilfuly and knowingly wear the duly prescribed uniform of an enlisted man
of the U.S. Navy. On May 11, 19h) he entered a plea of guilty to such
charge and was given two years probation with the exception that he would
be discharged from probation on and after his entry in military service
of the United States for the period of such service.

il

By teletype dated May 2, 194, Washington Field Division advised that a
check of the records in the Navy Department failed to reflect any Navy
enlisted ‘personnel record issued for either of the subjects but it was
stated that one GILBERT ARTHUR HERMAN, born November 24, 1922, Cuba, home
address 342 Taft St., Bristol, Pa., serving aboard the USS Thomas Jefferson,
might be HERMAN'S brother.

‘When I was first questioned by Mr. Sims around the last of March this
year, I told him that my name was Jack Dale Williams, but this is not

true and my real name is John Jack Grossi. I did this becuase I didn't
like the name and because I didn't want my mother to know about my trouble.
I also told Mr. Sims before that I had no criminal record, but this also
is not tiue because I was arrested and placed in New Jersey State Home for
Boys at Jamesburg, Ne J. I was arrested in Pennsylvania, the town of
Media. I was arrested for running away from home.

"T also stated in my first statement that my home was in.Florida, tut

this is not true. My home is 268 17th Ave., Patterson, N. J. where my
mother, Mrs. Rose Grossi, lives. My brother, Albert, is in Army Air

Corps, and my sister, Jean Engold, lives with my mother, I told Sims-
before that I had no brother or sister, and made up the first name I gave
for my mother. My father, John Grossi, is in the Armys Also I have never —

_been on the 5. S. Mills as I first said.

"As I-said before I have not registered for the draft although I am 18
years old,

"About six times during past year I have told people I was.in the Navy and
by means of such statement I have asked and received from them various

sums of money ranging from $10. to $18. each time. Usually this happened
while Thomas Harvey Herman and I were hitchhiking, .The first time was
coniing out of Philadelphia, and other times in Baltimore, Raleigh, N. C.,
Washington, D. C., and Norfolk, Va. Of course neither Herman or I have ~
ever been in the Navy. At these times we were wearing the uniforms we were

_ wearing when first picked up here in Savannah. ‘It was not tiué, as I first

said, that I just bought the uniform a. month ago. I have had it about 8 or
9 months, I can't remember any of the people who gave us the money, but

I do know that they gave me the money because I said I was in the Navy and
because I had the uniform on. ‘Herman was also wearing his uniform during
that time, and he has never been a Merchant seaman. I don't remember getting
any money by this means in Savannahe . .

"I have read the above statement of nearly 2 pages and it is true to the
best of my knowledge. I would also like to say at this time, that any
mercy shown by the court will be very deeply appreciated. If released, I
hope to return to N. Js and try me best to enter in the armed forces
immediately.

Special Agent SIMS can also testify that on May 8, 1944 he interviewed
Subject GROSSI at the Chatham County Jail, Savannah, Georgia, and that

at such time subject GROSSI was again given an opportunity to tell the
tyuth concerning his age. Subject GROSSI stated that he fully realized
that he would not be guilty of a violation: of the Selective Training and
Service Act of 1940 if he was not 18 years old. He stated that it would.
certainly be his desire to state that he was born in 1927 in order to
avoid such prosecution but he again stated that he was born’ duly 5, 1925 at
Patterson, New Jersey and that he had never registered under the Selective
Training and Service Act. At such time he was questioned carefully about
whether he was a parolee or an escapee from the New Jersey State Home

for Boys.at Jamesburg, New. Jersey, He stated that he was only a parolee
and he had never escaped from such home,

Special Agent SIMS can also testify that on May 8, 19kh, he interviewed
Subject HERMAN at the Chatham Bounty Jail, Savannah, Georgia, at which

time he admitted that several facts he had previously given were not

true; namely, that he was living at the Young Hotel, Tennessee Avenue,
Atlantic City, when he met subject GROSSI and that he had previously run
away from home because his mother, MRS. GLADA MAE HERMAN, 216 California
Avenue, Atlantic City, had made him stay home. He stated that she was not
dead as he had first told the agent. He stated that he had later gone

back and tried to locate his mother but that she had moved from such address
and he did not know where she was located at the present time. :

WILLIAM C. LASSITER, Lt.
U.S. Naval Reserve ~—
Savannahi, Ge Orgias

Lt. LASSITER who had originally questioned the two subjects on the day

they were apprehended by military police authorities was interviewed by

the writer concerning the uniform that subject GROSSI was wearing at the

time of his apprehension. Lt. LASSITER advised that it was his opinion

that the uniform iteelf was a Merchant Marine uniform and not one of the

Ue Se Navye He stated that since GROSSI was not wearing any Navy insignia
that such uniform, although it appeared very similar to a regular Navy
uniform, would not be classed by the Navy as suche He stated that he could
not say as to whether the two red service stripes which GROSSI had on one

of the sleeves of the uniform which he was wearing were Navy stripes although

it was his opinion that ordinary Merchant Seamen do not wear such service

stripes, He stated that the main distinguishing feature between the uniform
of the two subjects was that the Navy uniform which HERMAN was wearing con-
tained three small stripes around the collar which definitely designated

it as.a Navy uniform, and that GROSSI'S uniform did not have such three small
stripes.s
