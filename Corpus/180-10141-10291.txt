ANNEX B
THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter Ill, CSHB.70-1-I; 27 © :tober 1966
1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in.’
s terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of informat on about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela. .
tively small number of personalities indexed are of suflicient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, membe 5 of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target’ interest, or subjects on wlom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

,

The principal features of the 201 system are: .

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-12 34567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as idéntifying file num!-er for reporting on that
individual.

 

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening. form (Form
" 831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual Le, per-
sonal history, current status, and prospects. .. :

 

¢. The Master 201 Record: a machine record geneiated by the 6 ning of
2 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retri:ved! for special listings.

 

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

_ within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated. .

e. OF Code: a two letter symbol used in conji nection with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the as:ociation of an individual
with organizations or activities of Operational intere.t. OI codes cover- intelli-

“gence and Security service affiliation, whether staf’ or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI
codes for use by components:

- (1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OI codes assigned to a specific compone xt for intelligence services
or other specific organizations. .

A component may request an OI code be establis ied by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the compon nt Records Management
Officer. .

A 20] personality may be assigned two Ol codes, A1 OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Fo:m 831) is initiated (see.
paragraph 3b below) by filling ih Box 13 or a code inay be assigned or added
ata later date by a Form 831 amendment. : .

The 201 system has the capability of producin;: machine listings of 201
Personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI cod: has been opencd for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.

f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechar ized 201 Index, based on

names or other identifying information of Personaliti:s on whom 201 dossiers
exist.
