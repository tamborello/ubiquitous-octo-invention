The cost of overtime would be approximately
$3-4,000 weekly. There are some funds in CSI's
personnel services account, but these would soon run
out, and we would need to seek help from the
comptroller. We plan to send memoranda to the
directorates asking that they identify people willing

to work the overtime.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director

VIA: Director

Center for the Study of Intelligence
FROM: John F. Pereira

Chief, Historical Review Group/CSI
SUBJECT: Review of JFK Assassination Records
REFERENCE: Memorandum to you, dtd 1 Feb 93,

Same Subject

1. The purpose of this memorandum is twofold. First,
we summarize the current status of our review of the
Agency's JFK assassination records, and describe several
problems that CIA faces with respect to meeting the legal
deadline of 22 August 1993 for release of all the records to
the National Archives. Second, we propose several specific
actions to alleviate the problems.

2. This section discusses the four basic phases of our
review of the JFK materials--first review, coordination,
final redaction, and identification aids.

a. First Review: As of 1 April, the Historical
Review Group (HRG) has completed the first review and
preliminary redaction of approximately 114,000 pages
(of an estimated total of 250,000 pages) of the
assassination records. We have taken steps to speed up
the process in an effort to reach a pace that permits
us to meet the deadline. We probably can meet the
target date for the first phase if steps are taken to
speed up the other three phases.

b. Coordination: The process of coordinating our
review within CIA, which mainly involves the
Directorate of Operations, has been very slow for two
apparent reasons. One reason is the lack of resources
applied by the DO, although there has been improvement
lately. As of 1 April, the backlog yet to be processed

by the DO to catch up with HRG was approximately 57,000
pages. The second reason is the long time it takes to
reach agreement with the DO on what information can be
released. In this regard, part of the problem is the
DO's generally rigid view on protecting sources and
methods, even in the face of the provisions in the JFK
law that allow for withholding of information on
sources and methods only when there is "clear and
convincing evidence" that release "would demonstrably
impair" national security (see attached charts).

c. Final Redaction: As mentioned above,
preliminary redaction of the JFK documents is
accomplished during the first review phase. But final
redaction cannot be performed until coordination with
the DO and other components is completed. Therefore,
to the extent that the coordination process is delayed,
the final redaction phase is also delayed.

d. Identification Aids and Index: The
requirement to prepare identification aids (computer
forms) and an index presents a potentially major
problem for reasons discussed below:

The JFK legislation requires that each document
released to the National Archives have attached to ita
form called an identification aid. CIA and other
agencies were given software that is intended to
produce the forms, using computers. The software also
was intended to permit the creation of an electronic
index for all assassination records that are
transferred to the National Archives, which is also
required by the law.

Unfortunately, the newly acquired computers in the
Historical Review Group are not yet programmed to
perform the task. This means that there is a growing
backlog of documents for which no identification aids
have been done. Even when the software is fully
incorporated into our system, substantial time will be
required to complete this phase. We estimate there.
will be 92,000 documents for which aids will be
required, and at best it will take three minutes to key
in the data for each document. This means that we
would need six people working full time to finish the
aids by the deadline.

3. Proposed Action

To ensure that CIA meets the 22 August deadline, we
propose the following actions be taken (corresponding to the
four phases described above):

a. First Review: Expand the hours worked by some
of the nine independent contractors now assigned to
HRG. This would free up staff to devote more time to
the other three phases. .

b. Coordination: 1) Request the DO to devote
more resources to reviewing JFK documents, and 2)
Instruct the DO coordination officers to be more
responsive to the provisions of the JFK assassination
legislation that govern the release of information.
(draft attached).

ec. Final Redaction: To the extent that the pace
of coordination is improved, the pace of redaction will
also increase. However, we need to be prepared for a
possible last minute rush to complete the redactions,
which could entail overtime for staff officers and/or
further expanded hours for independent contractors.

d. Identification Aids: It is clear that with
only five months remaining until the 22 August
deadline, HRG review officers will not have enough time
to complete the review, coordination, and redaction and
also prepare identification aids*. We propose that a
group of document analysts or comparable specialists be
detailed to HRG to input the information for the
identification aids. We recommend that initially 20
such people be retained to work 10 hours of overtime
per week. An HRG officer would supervise the group and
provide quality control.

* The FBI has a similar problem, which it has addressed by
detailing 50 additional people to their JFK Reviewing Staff.
