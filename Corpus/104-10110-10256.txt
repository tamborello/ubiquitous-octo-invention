1.. At 2:00 p.m. this date, Mr. Richard Haberstroh, Intelligence
Officer, IaiS, telephonically contacted the writer. He stated that
he in turn had received a telephone call from Had Ahrens, the Inmigra-
tion District Director in Miami, which referred to arrangements which
had. been laid on during 1959, whereby Cubans of interest to this
Agency would be smuggled out of Cuba aboard a boat destined for
Tampa, Florida. Mr. Ahrens indicated to Mr. Haberstroh that apparently
the Cubans have become suspicious of the vessel, and the boat owner is
in “hot water" in this regard. According to Mr. Haberstroh, the CIA
representative in Miami was contacted by the boat owner's attorney
with the suggestion that a letter be obtained from the I&NS indicating
that they inspected the vessel on its several arrivals at Tampa and
that it carried no passengers.

2. Mr. Haberstroh stated that his quick reaction is that the
Service cannot comply with such a request. I informed Mr. Haberstroh

this matter.
