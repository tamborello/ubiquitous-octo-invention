PBRUMEN LIFEAT/LIERODE, Confusion in Use of Cryptonyms

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES-———

 

 

 

 

    
  

 

“lL, fhe Station's use of certain cryptonyms identifying technical
operations against PBRUMEN TPELIDE in Mexico has caused confusion. in
Headquarters elements responsible for sourcing and dissemination of
information produced, and for supporting the entire complex of
operations itself. The cryptonyms in question are (a) LIFEAT moe
(b) LIERODE -(c) MKTRAP (d) LICOOL/11 and (e) PBIMPULSE. The original
meaning of. these cryptonyms is being forwarded under separate cover.

 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 

‘~" 2,°. The purpose of this dispatch is to submit for Station comment
a review of the technical operational effort against PBRUMEN TPELIDE
since its inception. . The objectives are (1) to complete Headquarters
records, which lack considerable detail concerning the intricacies of .
the operation, (2) to urge a more precise use of cryptonyms in’: |
reporting. this activity which would benefit Headquarters personnel |
responsible for monitoring and supporting these operations and (3) to
suggest ‘a-few administrative adjustments which would dispel the: present
confusion mentioned in this dispatch. CO a ere ee

introduced. into the target using LIFEAT assets and was actuated: from

and does ‘not pertain to the intent of this discussion. | Properly ....°..
-speaking the initial effort begins with the activation of LIFEAT/.
-LIERODE in February 1959, as indicated in HMMA 12358. Subsequently ~
eight:(8) LICOOL*attempts were made during 1960-1961 against the same
‘target. The LICOOLS were monitored from a mobile LP (not LIFIRE), ~
’ Basehouse ABLE and Basehouse BAKER, and the latter came to be referred
-.. to as the LIERODE base. The most productive operation of this sort
seems to have been LICOOL/11, activated on 9 May 1959, according to

 

ceased functioning during late 1961. Please confirm.

Headquarters has the impression that the principal factors that
contributed to the suspension of MKTRAP activity from LIFEAT VI, were
the physical deterioration of the house itselZ and the divorce of the
basehouse keepers. The current LIFEAT Project Oytline indicates that
LIFEUD 14 and LIFEUD 17 were obtaining a divorce and were terminated
as of 30 September 1962. Headquarters assumes they were the occupants

of LIFEAT VI, yet the project outline does not show that the base was
closed. LIFEAT VI was listed on page 20 of the outline as an active
unit. On the other hand, page 15 of the outline states that LIFEUD 22
and LIFEUD 23 are occupying the "LIERODE photo basehouse", but that

' they have never been involved in LIFEAT work. This indicates that

’. LIFEAT/LIERODE and the photo work against the PBRUMEN target are now

' being conducted from two different basehouses, “The project outline.
