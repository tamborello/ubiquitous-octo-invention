1. WOFIRM has been requested by an Australian nevspaper
editor (Attachment A) to release the Warren Commission Document

$71 (CD 971 is Attachment 8B) which relates to anonymous telephone
calla to the Canberra Eubassy eat the time of the assassination of
President Kennedy. His request was turned down. As you probably
know, there has been mounting public pressure to release classified
documents of the Warren Comemigsion. While no decision has been
made to declassify CD 971, it is highly possible we will be asked
te do so in the near future by National Archives, which bas
official custody of the documents, or by some higher authority.

2. Melbourne Station is requested to discuss Paragraph -
One above with SQUIB/1 afterhis return to Australia. The SQUIB
service is mentioned in Paragraph 4 of CD 971 and release of the
document is certain to provoke questions in Australia. Since
CD 971 ie¢ a U. S. Government document we need not (and should not) -
request SQUIB concurrence for release of the document. He should
be informed, however, that release ef CD 971 to the public domain
is presently under consideration; that the United States Navy
has no objections; and that we are giving him advance notice as
a@ matter of courtesy. Any views volunteered by SQUIB/1 regarding
this release should be reported promptly te Headquarters.
