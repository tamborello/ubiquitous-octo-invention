become a police state and that Cuban wife, tolgpuy 1574 leTkeh BAe]

 

family "all tied up." ROJAS and his wife tolqgMEY 87 that

a Cuban communist named JUAN MARINE is a-friendof the family.

On one trip to Cuba, CACHITA ROJAS asked him to look into the

situation of her sister TERESA PROENZA to see how it could

be straightened out. MARINE recently visited Mexico "incognito"

and informed the ROJAS that the situation now is extraordinarily

good but that TERESA was once under a death sentence because

she had dealt with LEE HARVEY OSWALD while assigned to the

Cuban Embassy prior to the assassination of JOHN F. KENNEDY. ..

Her £ fends nterceded for her and her life was spared. ROJAS

‘told[ MEY ma MARINE warned them not to tell the. Cuban — GT e-]
' ‘Emba: ie xico City that he had spoken to.them about this

matter. ‘

The source stated that JORGE ROJAS and his wife
do not know how to cope with the present situation. They
fear going to Cuba-and they are speaking out against the Cuban
revolution in a most forthright.manner. The bitterness dis-
played by ROJASS wife f ceeds any that the source
can recall in the past. ey

The source stated that some years ago, as best he
could recall, he heard JUANA LUISA PROENZA, a sister of CACHITA
who died some years ago, telling a similar story of how TERESA
PROENZA was somehow involved with LEE HARVEY OSWALD at the
Cuban Embassy. At the time TERESA was employed at the embassy,
she lived with JUANA LUISA and another sister, Within the
family it has always been said that JUANA LUI worried herself.
to death after TERESA was ordered to Cuba. | uw)

The Mexico City Cffice has conducted a review of

references to TERESA PROENZA especially those dealing with the

OSWALD investigation and it is noted that as set forth in ;
exico City letter to the Bureau 1/24/64 in the OSWALD case DG)

as a result of her criticism of the handling of the CSWALD
