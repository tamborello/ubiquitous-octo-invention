nepert from DL-6-S, dated 7/22/60. This report has been serialized

; Informant determined that on 7/22/60 ‘BILL LOWERH phoned
JOE LANDIN and wanted to. know if he. could come over for their
‘regular CP meeting, JOE LANDIN told him. to riake it someother
time because they were expecting company.

: 7 BILL LOWERY told JOE LANDIN a little about the forum
meoting which took place on 7/21/60." The committee set up to ~
help in the mémodal of VINCENT TREVINOhad not done anything and
he had it dissolved and appointed a three-man committee to contact
other organizatims and try to form the Trevino Committee. LOWERY
Seemed thoroughly disgusted and threatened to quit the forun and
do something on his own about the TREVINO case. He used violent _
language in criticizing the “don't care" attitude of the’ forum,’ —
The TREVINO case, LOWERY said, was treated very lightly, He
stated he got mad at the rieeting and made most of the members mad
at him because he insisted they do something about the case. ;
It seemed that only three or four persons wanted to do something |
about it, Mrs, ROBERT H, JONES was one of them, and JOHN LANDIN,;
a non-member. was another. Informant determined that JOHN LANDIN .

was. ‘present because he wants the forum to sponsor a dance for hin.

 

: "Informant determined that BILL LOWERY: severely eriticized -
JOE MOLINA who is opposed to doing anything for TREVING. In the

-. past, however, LOWERY and MOLINA have worked ‘hand in hand. and

: this was. their first disagreement.

 

Informant ‘eould furnish 1 no additional information, ,
