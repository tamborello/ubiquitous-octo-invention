. 6.  (U) on 16 November 1978 Mr. Sapp discussed with Mr. Wigglesworth
‘the proposed written. response to the Committee. This response Het leeks
‘,,thata reasonable search was made and no such record was found. :

   

      
   

ad. : “w) On 21 November. ‘1978 Mr. Sapp requested that an additional :

search pe made of materials dated later than 1963. The reason for- this “"
search is that most materials in the unidentified’ boxes are dated 1961 .°.:
and 1962, but-the box listing says it contains 1963 files. The Bl:
. records listing was again reviewed for any 1964 boxes that_might. be’

appropriate for searching for 1963 files. According to Mr. Butler's.
phone conversation with the undersigned on 22 November’ 1978, nothing a
“the list merits such a search. * . .
