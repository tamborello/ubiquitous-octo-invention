Subject _ GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka
AR

SAMUEL MANNARING, aka.

  

on 5/9/61, FG 612-C advised SA THOMAS @. FORSYTH, III as
follows: ; :

The men operating the Mannarino-controlled horse room at
1195 Birth Ave., New Kensington, Pa., are being considerably
more careful in recent days than they have been heretofore.
Now they will not allow strangers in the horse room, and
they will not take a telephone wager unless they know the
ealler by name or voice.

Gamblers in New Kensington predict a “lot of trouble" in
the forthcoming primary eléctions.. The Mannarino group
favera re-nomination of incumbent Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK
and if the oposition group appears to have too good a
chance of defeating GARDLOCK they are expected to "pull
off something big. Porhaps they will attempt to switch
voting machines,

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS .
