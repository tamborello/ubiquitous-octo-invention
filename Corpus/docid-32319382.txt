Tae Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBI5)
Daily Report for November 21, 1967, states that Tass
International Service in English at 1411 GuT om Novesber 21,
1967, pointed out that in an Ixvestia tuterview, John D.
Sith ssid he was convinced that the late President Johan F.

: Could you supply a translation of the Isvestia
article to which this refers? The “broad conspiracy" line
is Ove which is currently in vogue among certain critics
of the Warren Coumission Report.

It is aleo noted that in the FBIE Daily Report for
November 20, 1867, on page bb18, a footnote to a broadcast
by Moscow Radio Peace and Progress, relating to Smith states:
“The Tbilisi Domestic Service in Rusatan at 0550 GWT 18 Hovember
reports that in the newspaper MOLODEZH GROYV.II you will find
the confession of the former ageat of the U. S. Central
Intelligence Ageucy entitled ‘I shot at the President.'"

Since thie would appear to be part of a build-
up of disinformation regarding toe aesaseination of John F.
Kennedy and involving John Discoe Smith, would it be
possible for you to identify the newspaper MOLODEZH GRUZI1
and furnish a translation of the "confession?"

Gazette." Since that date installments of his expose have
appeared in "Literary Gazette” and interviews (purportedly)
of Smith by Soviet broadcasters have been primarily beamed
