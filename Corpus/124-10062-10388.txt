that Alvarado was being treated cordially and that he was either
telling the truth. or was the world's best liar. This official advised
that Alvarado's interrogation was continuing and that this interview
would now be conducted in a little stronger manner. He furnished no
further elaboration on this statement but stated that Alvarado, who
is apparently familiar with the interior of the Cuban Consulate, was
unable to pick out a photograph of Sylvia Duran from a group of photos
of female individual $](eY 1 ;

<f0n the evening of 11/29/63, Legat, Mexico, received informa-
tion from a high-level Mexican official that Alvarado reportedly admitted
his story was a pure “Cabaggrbn designed to provoke the U. S. into

kicking Castro out of Cuba; n 11/30/63, Winn Scott, Chief, CIA, Mexico
City, advised that he had received information from Mexican authorities
who were interviewing Alvarado that Alvarado had admitted that informa-
tion furnished by him, regarding Oswald's presence in the Cuban Embassy
on 9/18/63 and the information regarding a pay-off to Oswald was a
icati above-mentioned reason. Scott advised that

yan official of the Nicaraguan Security Service
who is very familiar w Alvarado, arrived in Mexico City on 11/29/63
and during the last few hours of Aivarado's interrogation was in a room
adjoining that room in which Alvarado was being interviewed. As a
consequence, he was kept adyised of. the progress of Alvarado's inter-
view. According to Scott,[Wheelock] had advised that Alvarado in the E]
past had furnished information concerning Nicaraguan Communist Party
activities and 25% of the information furnished by Alvarado
was unreliable. escribed Alvarado as a person who believed @J
himself to be moré” intel igent than his control ‘officer. Scott stated
no information was available that the Mexican authorities had used any
violence in securing an admission from Alvarado _that his statements
were fabrication .(& j “7 To peey

Investigation by both Legat, Mexico, and CIA, Mexico, looking
towards identifying other witnesses allegedly present in the Cuban .Con-
sulate at the time Alvarado claims he saw Oswald receiving the above-
mentioned $6500, was unable to uncover the white male who possessed a
Canadian passport or the red-haired Cuban Negro. it is noted Cuban
Vice Consul Azcue reportedly returned to Cuban on 11/18/63. Mexican
authorities have been requested to assist in the possible identification
of the above-mentioned white male with Canadian passport and red-haired
Cuban Negro who allegedly witnessed the pay-off to Oswald. However, it
appears that Alvarado's descriptions of those persons who reportedly ~
\witnessed the pay-off are intentionally vague, thus making it impossible
to identify or interrogate “theltand-Teavine Daren as the only logical
person available to confirm or refute Alvarado's Statements (45 Aw
