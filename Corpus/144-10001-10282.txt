, NEW FACTS ABOUT KENNEDY'S MURDER

Izvestiya, 18 August 1966, page 3 Unsigned

fSditorial note7: The very large Swiss publishing house
Schweizer Verlaghaus is publishing a book written by an American
author of German origin, Joachim Josten, The Truth About the Kennedy
Murder, In view of the secrecy which continues to enshroud the
crime in Dallas, it is extremely characteristic that the author of the
sensational book was arrested by the Zurich police and, after being
interrogated, was put in solitary confinement for psychiatric examina-.
tion. It was only as a result of the intervention of his relatives that
he was released. However, the police issued a warrant for the author's
arrest and Josten was forced to leave Switzerland, "Couddn't it be,"
the Swiss newspaper Voix Ouvrier asks, "that he was arrested because he
also knows partg of the terrible truth?"

If you are one of those perspicacious people who felt from the very
beginning that there is something "terribly wrong" in the Kennedy murder
case, you will umoubtedly want to read this book, even if it means that
you will first have to learn German to do so, We are dealing with a book that is
the only one, out of all that have been published anywhere, in which the author
not pnly points out the obvious absurdity, blatant falsity, amt numerous
distortions and omissions, and the irreconcilable contradictions of the report
issued by the Warren Commission, but also advanced a very plausible version
of what actually happened in Dallas on 22 November 1963.

Actually, this is what happened there: Oswald, a shady character, but
a person who was not guilty of the murders foisted on him by the Dallas .
police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and, finally, the Warren
Comission, was only a previously selected scapegoat for an influential group
of conspirators whose coparticipants hold in their hands mighty levers of
power, They knew that as soon as their vile deed was done, they would have no
reason to fear retribution, since, in essence, Kennedy's murder was an
excellently organized political crime, which was thought out in such a way that
it "automatically" provided a complete guarantee of safety for the murderers
and their henchmen,

The author of this conclusion, which literally gives one the shivers,
does not rely on rumors, gossip, or “suppositions." Accusing the Dallas
police, the FBI, the CIA, and a number of highly placed people, he proceeds
entirely from the Warren Report itself and the court records, He writes in
the first chapter of his book:

The Warren Commission undoubtedly did a tremendous amount of work,
It had at its disposal an unprecedentedly rich supply of sensational
information which previously had escaped the attention of observers,
since no mention was made of it in the reports which got into the
press prior to that. However, a person who critically studies this
material and who does not allow himself to be thrown off the track
by the previously fabricated conclusions of the Warren Commission
cannot fail to be struck by an astonishing truth: Oswald was not
guilty; he was made the "patsy" for the real murderers, And actually,
on the basis of the Warren Report one can clearly see the outlines of
an almost improbably cunning plot which was supported by "big money"
and mercilessly carried out to its conclusion. However paradoxical
it sounds, the truth is that the Warren Commission, after successfully
"digging up" a multitude of facts pertaining to the Kennedy murder,
contrived to issue a verdict which is enZtirely contradictory to what
it actually discovered.

Therein lies the entire essence of the matter, Careful analysis
of the report issued by the commission shows without a doubt that, in
a deliberately and intentionally scandalous manner, it distorted
justice in the name of falsely understood "state consideratiors" which
were turned topsy~turvy, By no means are we discussing the personal
integrity and conscientiousness of the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, Earl Warren, or his assistants. We are discussing the integrity
and objectivity of their investigation, and that is a completely
different matter.

Tne Warren Commission deliberately distorted the truth concerning the
murder, bein; guided by two basic reasons: first, its own investigation showed
completely reliably that Oswald had never been a real Marxist, and had only
been a concealed agent of the CIA, who took on the disguise of a "Red" in order
to get access to the Soviet Union and then to Cuba, Herein lies the "mainspring"
of the monstrous deception which was heaped upon the world public by the authors
of the official version of the murder. For the same reason the Warren Commission
vent its materials to the National Archives, where some of them have been
stamped "Top Secret" and where they will be concealed from the public's fixed
attention for 75 more years. It is claimed that this is a matter of national
security, but actually this is one more brilliant example of how wretchedly the
CIA works and the illegal tricks that it resorts to,

Second, the commission was affaid that if it told the country the whole
truth, that would cause a public explosion whose force could practically be
compared with that of an earthquake. These petty fears are completely unfounded,
The American people is sufficiently matu:e to recognize the truth about the
mores of the political jungle. ven so, it will learn that truth in the fc
near future,

The book which we are discussing consists of 40 chapters and is
divided into five parts, It contains 360 pagés of text and 16 pages of
illustrations. It will be published early in September 1966 hy one of the
largest publishing houses in Switzerland, It will be given a prominent place
at the forthcoming book fair in Frankfurt and will undoubtedly attract
attention throughout the world,

In the first part ("Mister Warren's Fairy Tahe") the author acquaints
the readers with many of the absolutely absurd aspects of the Warren Report,
in which pseudoscientific banter is combined with statements made in the
spirit of Mother Goose,

Part two ("The Real Oswald and His Disguise") contains 19 chapters,
in which the author throws light upon very important aspects of the entire
matter: Oswald's close involvement in the secret-service intrigues, which,
in the final analysis, backfired on him. A careful analysis of his stay in
the Soviet Union proves that he was sent there as a spy by the Central
Intelligence Agency, but that he completely flubbed his assignment, Later,
upon returning to his homeland, Oswald became an informer and agent provocateur
for the FBI, posing as a provocateur-agitator, whereas his real goal was to
prepare an alibi in order, under the guise of a "Red", to get to Cuba, All
these attempts of his failed, This is explained partially by his own ineptness
and partially by the ineptness of his chiefs.

The third part ("Oswald's Disguise and His True Face!) is devoted to a
detailed examination of the most sensational and, at the same time, the most
alarming detail in the entire "Oswald Case!: he had a "double," a young
man who was so strikingly similar to Lee Harvey that dozens of people confused
them. The large number of facts cited in the Warren Report but, with the
most innocent alr, assigned to oblivion by the commission proves that fact
completely, That person -- who, judging by everythins, was another agent of

he CIA -~ deliberately gave testimony discrediting the real Oswald long
before Kennedy's murder occurred, And here is a curious thing: the Warren
fieport even names that sinister double. It was Larry Crawford, a henchman
of Ruby's and a "Jack of all trades," including murders.

In the fourth part of his book ("How the Truth Was Squelehed") the author
discusses the numerous ruses and dishonest machinations set in motion b7 the
Dallas police and the FBI in order to deliberately heap the blame on Oswald
(and also to cover up their own involvement in the murder), In this part of
the book the author tells how the "guardians of the law' fabficated or falsified
very important material evidence; how witnesses were forced to give false
testimony or were intimidated or prompted; how the testimony of other witnesses
was falsified or completely squelched; how the autopsy report was forged;
how the FBI and the secret service agents "re~created" an absolutely false
pictwre of the crime; and, finally, how the Warren Commission cynically covered
up all these monstrous violations and repeated them,

in the fifth part ("Bloody Repercussions of the Murder in Dallas") the
reader learns that since the murder occurred at least 13 people have been
killed or have died under suspicious circumstances since, in one way or another,
they came in contact with the awful truth hidden behind the shroud of falsifica-
tion and deception that had surrounded the Kennedy murder.
