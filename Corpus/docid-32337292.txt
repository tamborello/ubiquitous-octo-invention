Informant explained that he obtained this information
as a sample of the material the "Negro" agent that has access
to discarded Federal documents furnishes to the Soviets. He
stated that this particular page is of no value and was to be
destroyed by the Soviets; therefore, he was able to pick it up.
He said "they" get even more important papers and documents
from this source and what they get is supplied in large bundles
and boxes about 3-4 times a year. According to informant,
VADIM V, SOROKIN contacts this agent. After contact, SOROKIN
takes the material to his apartment, sorts it as to what is
important and then brings it to the Sovdel where the unimportant
papers are burned, Informant had no other information with which §
to identify this Negro agent, and he did not know where he workg.:

this information from this agent, it started an investigation by
