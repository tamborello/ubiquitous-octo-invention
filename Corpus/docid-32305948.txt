driven away, but he remained at the airport with the plane.
He added, MBDICO, the man whom he believes was BUFALINO,
and the unknown man returned to the airport and they flew
back to Avoca the same day.

and he is positive he recognized him as having been on the
June 24, 1957 flight. He also recalled that PAGNOTTI told him
the sick man from Detroit was a “big shot" but he did not
recall the name, and when the nam ANGELO POLIZZI was mentioned,
