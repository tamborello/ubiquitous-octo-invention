Someone may have lost to BELLO and KLEIN in a card game. & (un)

BELLO and KLEIN on March 18, 1962, and RAFT, ROSENBLOOM and

Chief Inspector SID BRADBERY, New Scotland Yard, who
has been handling this matter, in his reports, furnished certain
conclusions and observations on the basis of which he requests
FBI assistance as follows:
| (x)

Information in certain circles in London is to the
effect that BELLO was to obtain employment at one of the
gambling clubs as a dealer and that others of his party would
frequent his place of employment and assist in "fleecing other
gamblers who would be brought to the club by RAPT." Also in-
formation was received that in some way they were to use contact
lenses through which they could read marked cards. Along these
lines, members of the party would telephonically contact known
optical dealers and a further report will submitted by New
Scotland Yard concerning these contacts. fA.)

: BRADBERY points out that from inquiries he has made
it is known that contact lenses can be used by gamblers in con-

have been checking into the possibilities of contact lenses.
