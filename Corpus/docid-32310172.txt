stated that should Yixamar fail to come up with the necessary
funds to deliver to Cogswell and Harrison, that the $75,000
already on.deposit would be forfeited. (Source expressed .

the opinion that the transaction was possibly planned in that
assumption by persons in Cogswell and Harrison. and/or Peters.)
Julian further stated that the $75,000 was delivered in two
payments in the form of cashiers checks from the. Union Bank

In a telephone conversation with Julian on

: December 24, 1967, Julian advised source that Cogswell

io and Harrison had dispatched a number of Haitian tourists .

; . to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, for the purpose of surveillance Oy
of the situation there. ; a

Source made the following observations:

 

It is his opinion that the invaston of Haiti is
truly. in the mind of Vixamar. . Vixamar was possibly led to
Cogswell and Harrison by one or more persons with the overall
‘plan of relieving him of invasion operational funds, although
this is only conjecture. The firm of Cogswell and Harrison
in London is old and supposedly reputable, but a relatively - |
i small. operation which is more in the nature of a sporting . : \

gcods shop than a dealer in armaments. However, it has been
rumored that Samuel Cummings of Interarmco, Monte Carlo, has
purchased a controlling position in Cogswell and Harrison, .

although this has not been verified by source. Source .

theorizes that assuming that Sam Cummings did truly control, ot
it is not very likely that he woukd:fnvolve himsé?¥f in an

invasion operation of this nature nor in a "flim filam" . ~ i
confidence game, as. nis wealth is more than realistically on
substantial, and he is constantly under investigation and

surveillance by many Governments, probably including that

of the United States of. America. If Cummings were to involve

CONFI ORN TAL

; ; . Vixamar offered the source the explanation that
the letter of confirmation he received from Cogswell and

| Harrison was on a letterhead with a Liechenstein address

| rather than a London address, because the firm as well as

i ; “all the parties to’ the arrangement had agreed that it would

ii

“Henry Vixamar

be improper.to imply that the British Government was
sanctioning the transaction, and that for all practical
purposes it would be made to appear that the transaction
was taking place in a neutral country, that is Liechenstein.
Vixamar also mentioned that he feared that the intelligence
agencies of Great Britain would tend to dispoil his transaction
and ambitions. Colonel John Peters, according to Vixamar,
would be named Chief of Staff and would remain in Haiti i
Following an invasion until. such time as full military ‘

Vixamar. disclosed to source that’ Julian had recently
received word from Cogswell and Harrison to the effect that
_ the Dominican Republic was.no longer to be necessarily
considered for use as a jump-off spot for the invasion, .
and that once a one-third payment had been made to the firm, - an)
- merchandise and troops would be dispatched to an undisclosed oO
point and the invasion would be on a direct basis rather than
through employment of a stop-over or jump-off point.

Vixamar asserted that his operation is not involved i

in any way with Colonel Caamano, former Rebel Chief of Staff |
during the Dominican war in 1965, and that his relationship , “oo
with the President of the Dominican Republic was’ through Irwin aa
Davidson (probably I. Irving Davidson), Public Relations Counsel ° ;
in Washington, D.C., who is presently representing President -
calaguer and is also closely linked to the invasion operation

through Colonel J. Peters and Coqswell-and Harrison. Yixamar
denied to source that his. operation includes support from the
Castro Government. He asserted that hevis not a Communist

and has had no contact with the’Chinese, but that if his
monetary problems were not worked out, he would then in
desperation look to other directions for cooperation, ©

The source mentioned in the LHN is N¥ 5593-C-TE,.
who furnished the information to SAS DANIEL F. GARDE, JOHN
MARTIN OOGGETT and JOSEPH A, GEORGE, Much of the information
whicn he summarized on 12/28/67 he had previously furnished,
in part, on previous dates during December, 1967,

The LHMN is classified "Confidential" to protect
the identity of a source of continuing value,

The source had a tentative arrangement to meet with
VIXAHAR in London during the week of 12/25/67, at the Royal
Lancaster Hotel for reassurances of facts as outlined by
VIXANAR and in order that he might speak with principals of
Cogswell and Harrison, as well as with Col. PETERS. Source
has advised, however, that as of 12/24/67, he had decided
to gracefully witndrayw from involvement in the plans of YIXAMAPR
and source's investigative. assist to this office because it had
become anparent that the transactions worked out by Cogswell
and Harrison with VIXANAR may be more in the nature of a
confidence game in which VIXAMAPR is to be the victim than a
serious intention on the part of Cogswell and Harrison toa
actually become involved in a real invasion action.

LEADS.

The NYO and recipient offices will be alert for
any additional pertinent information concerning this matter
_which may be made available through established sources and
promptly advise the Bureau and interested offices of any
significant developments.

Henry Vixamar

. It ts source's diagnosis that some of the parties
that Vixamar has involved in his plans have probably succeeded ‘
in cleverly déluding him in a confidence game type operation
beyond Vixamar' s Dresent understanding,

 

Source concludes from Vixamar's conduct that he has
possibly... been "washed. out”..of..operational, funds for the. present
; He also concludes that, for reasons best
known to Vixamar. and Julian, Julian appears. to. be out.of the
‘ation, and that Julian and Vixamar apparently no longer
. trust one. another. The source furnished the following
| particulars: :
.

   

 

‘On December 14, 1967, the source received a visit
4 from Vixamar who came alone unaccompanied by Hubert Julian.
Vixamar indicated the intention of operating without the

assistance of Julian, and emphasized his desire that Julian

‘ should not be -apprised of this and any of his future dealings
Mn with the.source. He indicated that. he did not fully trust

Me “Julian, felt that he was evil, and feared he might be working

| “~-a double cross in selling information to the forces of Duvalier.
}
i

Vixamar claimed to have at his disposal a substantial
number of important personages from the emerging nations who are
also financing his venture to a limited extent, and that the
Government of Chad is rendering all possible assistance to his
program. He disclosed that the negotiations with Cogswell and
Harrison at London had been founded by Julian and, carried out
by him on Vixamar's behalf. Vixamar verified that he did
actually meet with Colonel J. (John) Peters, who confirmed to -° °
Vixamar all the details as to his ‘troops and training program
allegedly in progress for the invasion. - The transaction arranged
with Cogswell and Harrison, for the sum of two and a half million
dollars, covered overall total charges for a flying boat, motor:
torpedo boat, arms and munitions, and in addition the total
troop complement would not be less than 200 trained men, most
of whom were previously experienced in the Congo fighting under
Tsnombe and later under Mobutu. According to Vixamar, the
. arrangement with Cogswell and Harrison included the overall
I services of Colonel J, Peters and his complement of troops.
