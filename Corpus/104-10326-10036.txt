RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992. THIS MANDATES THE PUBLIC RELEASE
OF ALL INFORMATION. IN THESE DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING YOUR NAME WHERE
IT APPEARS, UNLESS THE ORIGINATING AGENCY CAN PROVE BY CLEAR AND
CONVINCING EVIDENCE TO A PRESIDENTIALLY-APPOINTED BOARD THAT ONE
OR MORE LIMITED EXCEPTIONS APPLY. EVEN THEN, THE RELEASE OF THE
INFORMATION MAY ONLY BE POSTPONED FOR NO MORE THAN 25 YEARS.
THOSE EXCEPTIONS AS THEY APPEAR IN THE ACT FOLLOW. THE ACT IS
VERY .PRO-RELEASE AND REQUIRES A BALANCING OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST.

7 UNDER THE BOARD’S INTERPRETATION OF THE ACT, YOUR NAME CANNOT

YOU PERSONALLY, YOUR FAMILY, OR ANY SENSITIVE ACTIVITY OR

COOPERATING INDIVIDUAL OR A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, AND PUBLIC
DISCLOSURE WOULD BE SO HARMFUL THAT IT OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC
INTEREST; OR

REVEAL A SECURITY OR PROTECTIVE PROCEDURE CURRENTLY UTILIZED, OR
REASONABLY EXPECTED TO BE UTILIZED, BY THE SECRET SERVICE OR

OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC INTEREST.

 

3. IF STATION WANTS, YOU MAY OFFER IDEN THE POSSIBILITY OF
COMMUNICATING WITH HEADQUARTERS VIA RATHER THAN BY
TELEPHONE OR LETTER. IN MANY CASES SE CONTAINS
SENSITIVE IF NOT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. ALL PREVIOUS RECIPIENTS
OF THIS LETTER HAVE HAD CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS; FOLLOWING ARE
ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

*A, WHY IS MY NAME IN THE<JFK ASSASSINATION>RECORDS?

WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY BUT YOUR NAME MAY HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN A
CABLE OR DOCUMENT, OR YOU MAY HAVE COORDINATED OR SIGNED A CABLE
*OR DOCUMENT WITH REFERENCE TO THE<ASSASSINATION.>

B. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

IT MEANS YOUR NAME WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE PUBLIC RELEASE OF ALL
*DOCUMENTS PERTINENT TO THE<ASSASSINATION.> THE DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN
RELEASED TO THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION
(NARA) WITH THE NAME REMOVED AND IF WE DO NOT MAKE A COMPELLING
CASE THE PRESIDENTIAL BOARD WILL RELEASE NEW VERSIONS OF THE
DOCUMENTS WITH THE NAMES. THE FIRST REVIEW OF NAMES WILL BE THIS
SUMMER AND IT WILL CONTINUE AS DOCUMENTS ARE REVIEWED. ONCE THE
BOARD RULES THE DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION MUST BE RELEASED IN 30 DAYS.

C. WHAT EXACTLY DOES "RELEASE" MEAN?

IT MEANS THE GENERAL PUBLIC WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENT VIA
NARA. THERE ARE PROFESSIONAL RESEARCHERS WAITING FOR ACCESS TO
THE MATERIAL.SO THAT THEY CAN RESEARCH THE VARIOUS CONSPIRACY
THEORIES. WE KNOW OF SOME ORGANIZATIONS THAT WILL MOST LIKELY PUT
THE INFORMATION IN COMPUTER SYSTEMS SO IT CAN BE EASILY SEARCHED.

D. WHAT IF I DON’T WANT MY NAME RELEASED?

YOU AND WE WILL HAVE TO CONVINCE THE PRESIDENTIALLY APPOINTED

REVIEW BOARD THAT YOUR SITUATION MEETS THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN

THE GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS. (TO

BE ABSOLUTELY FRANK, THIS IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DO AND THE

VERY FEW CASES WHICH WE HAVE WON HAVE BEEN BASED ON VERY SPECIFIC |

AND COMPELLING REASONS. 7

E. WHAT DO I DO NEXT?

IP RELEASE OF YOUR NAME IS NOT A PROBLEM, YOU DON’T HAVE TO DO
ANYTHING. IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR NAME RELEASED, YOU NEED TO
ADVISE US OF THAT FACT AND EXPLAIN IN DETAIL WHY RELEASE WOULD BE
HARMFUL TO YOU AND NATIONAL SECURITY. WE HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST
RELEASE ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE COVER MECHANISM WITHOUT SUCCESS TO
DATE, AND WE WILL CONTINUE THE EFFORT. THE BOARD HAS NOT BEEN AND
¥S NOT LIKELY TO BECOME SYMPATHETIC TO A PRINCIPLE BASED

ARGUMENT.

F. IF MY NAME IS RELEASED, WHAT ABOUT MY COVER STATUS?

THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF YOUR TRUE NAME

AND THE AGENCY WILL HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT CAREFULLY TO DETERMINE

THE VIABILITY OF CONTINUED COVER PROTECTION.
