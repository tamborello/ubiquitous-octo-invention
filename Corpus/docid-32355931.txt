GABEOTT Jagainet the usual rua of activities is fairly good. The Station would
excluda from consideration, for example, any Job that required good to
-excellent command of written English. The would immediately knock out
‘any finished tranelation work. In addition, GABBOTT should act be considered
for any creative (KUWOLS) writing. He is jast 2 iitele toe zomantic and
impdactical to werk in thie field. Provicusly mentioned but worth repeating

de our firm bolief that GABBOTT should not ba used as am agent handler or

eoeruiter,
‘ * @ This, then, ac far as she Station can analyze the preblem, brings
us to the conclusion that GABBOTT is doing here ia Mexico the kind of work he
ie bestauited for. The‘next question is whether or not he should be seat
elsewhere, There fs tho usual argument that a coan should ac? serve in the

area that ie hie wife's native esuntry. Balanced againat thig perfectly sound
theoretical judgement ie the fact, noted at least by inference above, that ,
much of GABBOTT's present value ig based on his leag term (4 yeare)

a ce with the jecal scene, people, language, area. Of some importance
is the fact that both GABBOTY and hie wife have evidenced a dectre to remain
in Mexico. .

_ | @ From our Mmited vantage point, there appeare a alight advantage
_ to KUBARK in retaining GABBOTT in Moxico for the ferfecable future, barring
any worsening of the probleme noted ia paragraph 4 above. Obviously, this is
a Headquarters decigion and the Station requeste that Headquarters inform uo
ofthat decisien, ;

2. Evaluation of specific Dutiea

a. LIFEAT monitoring and processing. For the past year GABBOTT
has continued performing his main function, that of listening to, transcribing

and typing the take from LIFEAT coverage of various BEDOX targots. Thia
has included LIFEAT/LITMUS -- as average of three tapes a day, plus sporadic
coverage of targeta of operational interest such as BECOMPLEX aad individual |
BEDOX officials! homes. Although case officer presaure must be regularly
applied to keep GABBOTT up to date on this work, he does do a commendable
job, not only im his selection of pertinent traffic, buat in terme of the light he
often sheds on the significance of conversations recorded, The very fact that
he hag a continuity in the field, plug knowing some of the people involved, hag
been of real operational aesistance.

b. Operational Development of and Elicitation from BESEAL. _ Dering
the past year, GABBOTT has been in contact with BESEAL on an average of

a little leas than once a month. In addition to two positive intelligence reports

% were pul cut on the basie of these contacts, GABBOTTY haa been abla to

develop a relatively close pargonal relationship with BESEAL, The word

“relatively” is ased because, although the frequency of BEGEAL's contact with

- GABBOTT leaves something to be desired, we are not avare that BESEAL
spends more time with asy other lecal contact.

 

Although net the subject of thig dispatch, && should be neted in
pasaing that BEGEAL dees not give any indication, at the present time, of ;
being recrultable, Nevertheless, the Statien plans to continue BESEAL/GABBOTT
Contact to give us-a contiuuing assessment of him, plus affording us a seurce
of information on Osher official BEDOX pereonnel and ef positive intelligence.

¢. Gontact with BECOMPLEX and Family. GABBOTT hae been uned
in a minor role tm the investigation of BECOMPLEX, a pensible BEDOX iMegal
agent in Maxice City. GABBOTT has known BECOMPLEX slightly for several
years. Ho haa been able to provide uo with background information on
BECOMPLEX, hie present whereaboute and activities, and leads to othera in
the local community that know more about BECOMPLEX's past and present,

ad. BECATCH. GABBOTT provided the Station with the {rat a98e8B-
ment af BECATCH, which in ture led to BECATCH's recruliment by the cage
ekileer, jadepdently of GABROTT.

3. Evaluation of Overall Parfor mance
; Serene ne, £ PICK MaRCG

&. The Station evaluates GABBOTT's overall performance ao being
adequate ia moat respecte and anly weak or proficient (by fitesoa repost
standarda) in a few aspects. Mere important, thore hae been general improvee
meat in almest every report during the past year. .

b. GABBOTT's outstanding positive attributes are big knowledge of
the local ecene, his alSclty to spot worthwhile operational information ia the
jarge amount ef garbage te be feand in the LIVEAT material, and his ability
te devalep pergenal relationahipe with targets of interaat.

¢. His weaknosecs, more theroughly examiaed below (under
Preblems) are a need for clese, supervision (ity moetinga), a lack of organi«-
zation leading to occasional tardinoge in submitting hig work, aad ditfculey ks
handling his persenal affairs (@mances and marriage), which in turn affecta
hie production. Finally, his incomplete command of Englieh Mmmite hie present
and futere potential.

a. Im vating GABBOTT ia the range of gonoralict/ specialist,
GABBOTT clearly emerges as a specialict. The Station belicvac that his
activities should be Mmited to LIFEAT type procesoing and the develepmont
and agecagment of operational targete. I¢ ip clear that he should not be
soncidered for recruitment or agent handling, His poychological makeup, plag
hie lack af desire for such work makes. thia point obvious.

4 Problems. A review af the problems that affect GABBOTT's
Biilisation is in order.

a. Need fer Close Sapervision. Without daily contact, it hae bean
proven that GABBOTT precrastinates with his work and inevitably falle behind,
At best, coagtamt pressure must be applied to keep him current. Thic tendency
toward tardiness in submitting hie work ie in tara partially based on several
other problems noted below: namely, mayital difficultice, occasional illness,
plus the rather tomantic, impractical aatare of the man. it should ba streased,
however, that the last year hae wltnesged & marked, if not remarkabic improva«
inent in the thmelinees of GABBOTT's reporting. Althoagh thie has net resulted
in logcening the need for close supervision, af least we have a mere productive

2 1 ®& . Marsiage. GABBOTT married a Mexican girl, 25 years his
junior. in April 1963. 1¢ has come ao no great surprise to the Station that this
marriage, between a high-atrung middle aged Polo to a high-strung young

Latina, hag resulted in a delicate oltuation. GABBOTT hag been reporting to

the case officer from time to time on bis fighte with his wife. Thoy have

covered a wide vange of issues, but mostly base themaelveo on finances, The
case officer recently witnessed what must have been one of the more hair-
ralaing of theee marital iueds. Although difficult to believe, the noxt day saw
GABBOTT making up with hie wife. Despite thie apparent recenciliation, the
cace officer thought it necessary to apesk with both parties, separately, to try

to determine the implications of these marital feuds as regards the security

and officiency of GABBOTT'e omploymeat with KUBARK. The result of theee
talke waa that the case officer believes that, although flareups euch ag he
witmeagad will almost inevitably recur from time to time, there ig Metle doabt
that the two partmera ave in love and are equipped to reconcile after even the ;
mostiltuperative exchanges. Of the two, GABBOTT's wife appears to be the mare
willing te give (and forgive).

Tho mother-in-law, whe lives with GABBOTT and hia wile,
doos not in the case seem to be the problem that ons would imagine. GABBOTT
insiste that he likea her very mach and that she often takes his cide of the ©
argument. Hie wife confirmed this claim to the cage officer,

; There does xot appear to be much the cage officer can do excopt
I rauniter thie marriage in order to be able to continually asaves the possible
chance of permancnt sstrangemunt and its seubseqnent effects on GABBOTT's
KUBARK etatus. At the present time, the caseofficer does not balleve the
situation to be insapportable.

¢. Finances. ¥or the past yoor, GABBOTT hag been forced to

Kepay regularly to KUBARK the relatively large amount of money he owed frem
hie laat trip to Headquarters. As of | December 1963, he will be cut of debt.
Hio inability to make payments on a voluntavy basis, tried for cevoral months,
together with the financial burden ef repayment (at the rate of $150 US per
month for come 10 months), hag been the caus@.of considerable concera to

- GABBOTT and hae oa oceasion cent Rirs into aepthe ef despondency and self-pity.
Bie inability, at least until recently, to “budget” his wife hae added to hie
probleme. It is heped, sew that he hag with the cave officer's guidance,

~~, established somo clemontary arrsagements for a houaehold badget, and will

WU momentarily be oat of debt, that this particular problem will become alleviated.
On the other hand, the caee officer realistically must admit that he dseg not
foraes the day when GABBOTT will become able to control his Guancial life
in a cempletely compoteat masner. He ie simply act exough “of thie warid"
te ever get completely én top of this eltuation. That he can, with supervision,
maintain an acceptable fimaneial ceadition is our fervent hope and cautious belief.

5. Geaclugtone and Propogala. - “oY

a in the preceding paragrnaphe, the case officer has attempted to
lay on the line his exact evaluation of GABBOTT's present performance, his
strengths and weaknesees. The conclueion ie that theStation is catiefied, that
be meets KUBARK employment standards. Although fully realising that he
does net represent one of the organizations oustanding asesta, he does not fall
inte the category of thoes that sheuld be fired. If this proposition is aceepted,
the next question ie whether or act hie abilities are being utilized ae fully aa
possible in Mozico. .

 

; & Obiisusly, the Station ie net in as good a pesition as Headquarters
to answer this question. If, however, our ability te cee the fl) range of
opportuniticsa for GABBOTT's utilization ie Limited, our ability to stack up
