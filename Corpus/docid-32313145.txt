Mr. J. Edgar Hoover *
Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D.C,

Dear Mr. Hoover:

As you know, on October 5, 1964 I was demoted from Grade
Grade 13 and transferred to the field for delinquencies note
Oswald case. On October 8, 1964 after I had talked to Mr. M —
transfer was changed from Milwaukee to Washington Field Office ut
the demotion was continued. As I previously advised you I sincerely
appreciate this change and it alleviates some of the personal problems
caused by the demotion.

" rere

Since that time I have tried to reconcile the severity of this

quencies charged to me ana I can only conclude
that because you did not have the full facts concerning my part in
this case, there has been a miscarriage of Justice. Not only is the

2 110% Salary cut severe, but the blot on my career and the reputation

to accept. I feel compelled therefore, to bring to your personal ;
Ge jattention my Side of the story. TI did not have an adequate opportunity
Q@ {to do so before my demotion. I know you are busy but I appeal to you
to review this matter. I have no other recourse. Outlined below is

teletype dated October 10, 1963. Such contact cases were assigned

to my desk. TI have been charged with: (1) Failure to take action

on ‘the October 10, CIA teletype; (2) Delay in reviewing the file;

(3) Failure to instruct the field to intensify investigation and vi

I sincerely believe that none of these was either causative or is
substantive, They did not involve violation of any Bureau rules or
policy, ere was no deliterate delay and they did not go to the
merits of ‘the case or affect the outcome,

Inadequate Opportunity to Defend Myself

On the date of the assassination, although other supervisors also
had en interest in Oswald, I was instructed to prepare immediately
a-summary for the Director. This was done and thereafter I was
assigned to head up or direct the group of men to review the
material found in the search of Oswald and his residences and the
results of investigation of Oswald and prepare a detailed report
to go to the Department and the White House. Even in the first

3 or 4 days literally hundreds of communications were received
which required long hours of very intensive work. I continued in
this capacity until January 1964 when I returned to my desk.

 

2. |On November 26, 1963 Mr. Gale called for interview and asked me
a number of questions about my handling of this case. I was under
considerable tension at the time due to the long hours of work

   
 

 

an and the tremendous job of getting out the report which was due in
Noa a few days. I answered the questions as best I could from memory

ens and without reference to the file. He asked me to submit written

§ : answers to 4 questions which I did by memorandum dated November 26,196
ers The file was not available for review but I utilized my ticklers

a: € and prepared the answers as rapidly as possible so that I could

Y +r

get back to the main Job of getting out the report to the Department
and the White House.

On December 13, 1963 I was advised that I was being placed on
probation for 4 delinquencies noted in my handling of this case.

On December 19, 1963 I was commended for my efforts in the preparation
of the brief and report which went to the-President's Commission.

On March 19, 1964 I was advised that I was being removed from
probationary status. .

On September 29, 1964 I was requested by Mr. Sullivan to prepare
for Mr, Gale a memorandum explaining why I had not placed a stop
with the State Department against the issuance of a passport to
Oswald. I submitted a memorandum dated September 29, 1964.

On October 5, 1964 I was advised that a further analysis had been
made of the manner in which I carried out my supervisory responsi-
bilities in this case and because of my complete failure to fulfill

I was not interviewed in connection with the "further analysis"
of the case nor given any opportunity to further review the case or to
expand on the brief explanations given on November 26, 1963. I therefore
sincerely feel that I was not given an adequate opportunity to defend
myself or present my-side of the story before my demotion.
