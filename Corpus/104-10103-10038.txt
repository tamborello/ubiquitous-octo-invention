determined that $33,500 was advanced to him

for travel and transportation of household

goods to and from Madrid with one trip to

Paris for he and his family to renew their ;

Spanish visas. Ail of this advance was fully

accounted for. However, in his accounting, .

one item appeared unusual. It was an | .

expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive . DC

operation which was approved for write-off by Mr.
- Desmond Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without . - us

further accounting. ; coe yt

 

3. Also, we confirmed that no other Agency advance accounts: .
were established for Mr. Hunt during this period. Se

. 4. At the beginning of his non-official cover tour, it

was necessary to establish a bank account in his name. The ol

EUR Division accordingly requested we open an account at the. |

Chase Manhattan Bank in Mr. Hunt's name to receive all non-_ me
‘salary payments. (Mr. Hunt had an account at Riggs National © ~ =; =
' Bank to receive his salary and allowance payments). The =. eres
Following deposits were made to the account during 1965 and.

1966: _ ;

Account opened: 13 July 1965

6 October 1965 — 5,000
19 July 1966 5,000.

. = $30,000.

All o£ the above have been accounted for by submission —

of travel and transportation accountings.
- 8. We feel at this time without specific guidelines that
further searching would be somewhat fruitless. One strange
aspect of the non-official cover assignment in Madrid is that .. —
all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the ce
. BUR Division which is not normal as non-official cover people. -
“are usually assigned to a project. -It is unusual to have as..
“case officer abroad for one year on-an operational ‘assignment -
without him incurring operational expenditures. =: | 2

6. The Office of Finance has not found operational

’ expenditures except for the $1,600 mentioned above.
Therefore, it is suggested that Mr. Karamessines be questioned
_as to a project or projects to which Mr. Hunt's operational
expenditures if incurred . would have been charged. ;

7. Another possible. course of. actjon is to request. the De
Director to approve my aSking “iat Chase =. -
. Manhattan Bank to provide a transcript of a ‘entries into. ~-.

. Mr. Hunt's Chase Manhattan Bank account.
