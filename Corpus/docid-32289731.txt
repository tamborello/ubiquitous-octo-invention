Johnson stated that he is almost certain that Alex did not go
to Los Angeles with Marianne and is positive that he was not
in Palm Springs with his wife. It is noted that it-is most
unusual for Alex to allow his wife to travel alone and this
may indicate that hé was not available for travel with her
during that periodsof time. ;

. A. C. Jawarek, Manager, Murray Hill Apartments, 1.300
North Marine Drive, advised on April 273.1959, that he saw
Alex at that address, which is the residence of Alex on
either April 23 or 2h, 1959, and that. this was the first time
he has seen him for several weeks. He stated that this is
not particularly unusual since he very frequently does not
see tenants from month to month. He stated that last week -
he was in contact with Alex due to the fact that Alex reriewed
his lease until April 30, 1960. He cannot remember whether
Mr. or Mrs. Alex paid the rent for March and stated that it
was paid, as always, in cash.

Charlie Postl, owner, Postl's Health Club, 180
West Randolph, advised on April 27, 1559, that Alex is a member
of his club and that he was in the club on April 24, 1959, ©
but that he. does not recall whether Alex was in town during
the latter part of February or during ‘any time in March. It
is noted that Postl is believed to be senile and is not
particularly cooperative. He stated that there were no
records which he could check to determine whether Alex was,
- in town during March, 1959. ' ;

. CG 6272-C, who is-a close personal friend of Alex,
was in Florida from December, 1958, until April 8, 1959, and
therefore stated that he was in no position to furnish any
information concerning Alex's whereabouts in March.

Potential Criminal Informant Ray Longtree was
unable to furnish any information regarding Alex's whereabouts
in March. oo i
On March 18, 1959, Charles Christiansen,’ Sr.

en It is noted that Mr. Christi a
and other o cials o é.bank have refusea[_—
[_]ve re-examined and the only reason they furnished them in

the first instance was due to the issuance of a subpoena ~ ;

.in connection with an investigation being conducted by Secret
Service. It is noted that these companies are controhled

by Eddie Vogel, Chicago, top hoodlim and that investigation

at the companies .to determine whether Alex was in town

on March h, 1959, has not been conducted due to the fact that

it is obvious Vogel would furnish no information in that

regard and that he would furnish details concerning con-

tact of him by Bureau Agents to Alex.

     

. An informant, who has furnished reliable information
in the past, advised that he observed Alex at the Tradewinds
Restaurant on Rush Street, in Chicago, on the night of
March 23,.1959, but could furnish no information concerning
Alex':: whereabouts in early March or at any other time.

Information was received this week indicating that
possibly Alex was maintaining a second residence in the
Esplenade Apartments, 900 Lake Shore Drive, but extensive
investigation this week at that address and at the realty
company which manages the Esplenade Apartments, determined
that Alex has never lived there. :

Contact has been made with ‘the following individuals
at the following airhines who carry almost all travelers of.
this area to Europe. This investigation did not determine
that Alex has flown, under his. true name, from the Chicago
terminals of these companies during the past year. It is
noted that Alex may have used another name in traveling but
this 1s not believed likely due to the fact that his passport
carries his true name. : . ; .
