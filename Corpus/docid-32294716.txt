alleged heads of the ‘criminal organization in the :
Pittsburgh area, they are not member-sources of "Causa '

member-sources of the Pittsburgh criminal organization.
These sources, however, consider ANTHONY "TONY" GROSSO
as strictly a large independent numbers man who has
been able to maintain independence from the LA ROCCA -
MANNARINO group.

NY T-1 (id&ntified in New York report dated
12/19/62) states there are approximately 10 "families"
in "Causa Nostra™ outside the New York area, NY T-1
named specific cities which did not include Pittsburgh.
. Pittsburgh has previously prepared Anti-
Racketeering reports on all individuals mentioned above
as possible members of the Pittsburgh criminal organization
except for JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA, JO JO PECORA and
THOMAS ANTHONY CIANCUTTI.

In view of the fact that JOHN CHRISTOPHER

FONTANA, JO JO PECORA and THOMAS ANTHONY CIANCUTTI

have been identified as members only by former PCI .
non-member - source, reports are not ; OTHER 4
on the latter three individuals. It is

to be noted, however, that information has been developed

and reported in reference to FONTANA, PECORA and

CIANCUTTI in connection with Pittsburgh cases entitled,

"SAMUEL. MANNARINO, AR"; "GABRIEL MANNARINO, AR," with whom

they are associated. . .

Investigation is continuing to develop a
. member-source that can definitely identify members of
the Pittsburgh criminal organization.
