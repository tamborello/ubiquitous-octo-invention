THE TWO REPRESENTATIVES INDICATED THAT, IF AMERICAN AID 1S NOT
FORTHCOMING, OTHER SOURCES WILL BE CONTACTED. IF THE AMERICANS
HELP THE NATIONALIST CAUSE OF THE OPPOSITIONISTS, THEY WILL

 

HAVE SOME MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER THE RESULTS; OTHERWISE,
THEY WILL HAVE NONE. (FIELD COMMENT. FVS 865}, TDCS-3/540,447, REPORTER
"AN EARLIER DISCUSSION BY THESE INDIVIDUALS, )
2. ACCORDING TO THESE OPPOSITIONISTS,. THE COUNTRY HAS

REACHED A COMPLETE IMPASSE AND SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN SOON. IF

DIEM SHOULD DIE SUDDENLY, THE RESULT WOULD BE CHAOS, OUT OF

WHICH THE COMMUNISTS WOULD EMERGE AS THE ONLY BENEFICIARIES.

DIEM REMAINS IN POWER ONLY AS THE RESULT OF AMERICAN MILITARY

SUPPORT, WITHOUT WHICH HE WOULD BE COMPLETELY LOST. THE DIEM
GOVERNMENT 1S WORSE THAN IMPOSSIBLE.” “THERE ARE

A NUMBER OF. GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY, SUCH AS THE HOA HAO “AND” THE

CAO DAI, THAT ARE COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO COMMUNISM BUT CANNOT

POSSIBLY SUPPORT THE PRESENT REGIME, WHEREAS THEY COULD SUPPORT
