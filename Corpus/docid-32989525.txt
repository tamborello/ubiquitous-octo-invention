‘55-49, 7-26-55, instructing that searches of three-part Chinese

names be made in every possible sequential combination and

that only one index card be prepared on such names. Experience
in the Buréau's Records Branch has indicated that although the
order of the three components’of a Chinese name may change,

the clockwise sequence of such names has never been disturbed,
For example, "CHEN TSE TUNG" might be receiyed as "TUNG CHEN TSE"
but never as "CHEN TUNG TSE." Therefore effective immediately

‘you are instructed to’ have such names searched in three ways,

"CHEN TSE TUNG" would be searched:

1. CHEN, TSE TUNG
. 2 TSE, TUNG CHEN .
3. TUNG, CHEN TSE : : _p
