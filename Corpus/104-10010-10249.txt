has been to the Russian Consulate. :

RUSSIAN CONSULATE: Wait a minute.

Silvia Duran is then heard to speak in English to
someone apparently sitting at her sidé.” This conversation goes
as follows:

"He said, wait. Do you speak Russian?”

"Yes."

"Why don't you speak to him then?”

"I don't know’... "

The person who was at the side of Silvia Duran and
who admitted to speaking some Russian then gets on the line
and speaks what is described as "terrible, hardly recognizable

Russian." This person was later identified as Lee Harvey Oswald.

OSWALD: “I was in your Embassy and.spoke to your
Consul." :
RUSSIAN EMBASSY: “What else do you want?"
OSWALD: ~"I was just now at your Embassy and they took
my address." , ° ,

RUSSIAN EMBASSY: "I know that."

OSWALD: "I did not know it then. I went to the
Cuban Embassy to ask them for my address, because they have it.”

RUSSIAN EMBASSY: Why don't you come by and leave it
then, we're not far. :

OSWALD: “Well, I'll be there right away."

October 1 - 10:30 a.m.
A person later identified as Lee Harvey Oswald,

speaking in "broken Russian," telephones into the Soviet Embassy.

and talked to your Consul. They said they'd send a telegram to
Washington, and I wanted to ask you, is there anything new?"

you will. -

i no one in Cuba and therefore it’s aifficult to give him a visa,
He says he knew it would take a long time to process the Soviet
visa but hoped.to await that in Cuba.

RUSSIAN EMBASSY: “the thing is that if his wife is

now in Washington she will receive the visa for return to Russia.
She will receive it and then can send it any place but right now
she does not have it."

- SILVIA DURAN: "Naturally, and.we can't give him a
visa here because we do not know if his Russian visa will be
approved."

RUSSIAN EMBASSY: "We can issue a visa only according
to instructions."
SILVIA DURAN: "That is what I will put in my plans."~
RUSSIAN EMBASSY: "We can't give him a letter of recom
oe " mendation either, because we do not know him. Please pardon the.

SILVIA DURAN: "No bother. Thank you very much."

Embassy. : :
: VOICE FROM THE SOVIET EMBASSY: What's the number of
the Cuban Consul? :

VOICE AT THE CUBAN EMBASSY: Its! 11-28-47.

September 27 - 4:26 p.m.

 

Someone at the Soviet Embassy telephones into the
Cuban Consulate. The person answering the phone at the Cuban
Consulate is Silvia Duran.

RUSSIAN EMBASSY: Has the American been there?

SILVIA DURAN: ‘Yes, he is here now.

RUSSIAN EMBASSY: According to the letter that he.
showed from the Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to
Russia to stay for a long time with his wife who is Russian.
But we have received no answer from Washington, and 4t will
probably take four to five months. We cannot give a visa here
without asking Washington. He says he belongs to a pro-Cuban
organization and the Cubans cannot give him a visa without his

first getting a Russian visa. I do not know what to do with him,

-T have to wait for an answer from Washington.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD we 2 fev 7S: 2s / O V/s 6Y

FROM: _ W. David Slawson .

SUBJECT: Intercepts from the Soviet and cuban Embassies in
Mexico City

The following are my notes from reading the inter-.
cepts. in question in the American Embassy in Mexico City,
translated from the Spanish by Embassy personnel, on April 13,
1964. These notes are about as accurate and detailed as I
could make them without actually quoting the entire trans-
eripts. Ina few instances, either where it was very important
or where the meaning’ was obscure and therefore difficult to
‘paraphrase, I have quoted exactly. I have noted these portions

by placing them in quotation marks. i

September 27 - 10:37 a.m.
‘A person who sounds like an American speaking poor
Spanish, later identified as Lee Harvey Oswald, telephones the
Soviet Embassy.
OSWALD: May I speak to the Consul?
INSIDE VOICE: He is not in. -
“OSWALD: I need some visas in order to go to Odessa.
INSIDE VOICE: Please. call at 11:30.
; . OSWALD: Until when?

INSIDE VOICE: (Hangs up)

September 27 - 4:05 p.m.

 

A woman's voice, speaking in Spanish, later identi-
fied as Silvia Duran, speaking from the Cuban Consulate,
calls into the Soviet Embassy. -

SILVIA DURAN: © There is an American here who has
requested an in-transit visa because he is going to Russia.

I would like to know whom he spoke to at the Russian Embassy,
pecause I sent him to you thinking if he got a Russian visa
that I could then issue him a Cuban visa without any more
processing. Who did he speak to? He claims he was told there
were no more problems.

INSIDE VOICE: Wait a minute. (The inside voice

then: explains to someone else on his side of the line that

Silvia Duran is calling, that she is calling in reference to

   

 

an American who says he had previously been to the Soviet
Embassy, etc.)

ANOTHER INSIDE VOICE: Please leave the name and
number and we will call you back.

SILVIA DURAN: (She leaves her name and her telephone

 

y and’she then engages in some personal ‘conversation in
regards to the fact that she has recently changed apartments
and therefore would like the "bulletin" sent to her new address.

The voice in the Soviet Embassy agrees.)
