The membership also contains a number of individuals
that have been active in the south in integration members and
freedom rides.

No nae, has been received to date to the
effect that the Communist Party sponsored the organization
or is endeavoring to obtain control or direction.of it. /NO
886-S, who is acting district organizer of the CP, has no
knowledge of this organization. Y

Since referenced New Orlea letter and letterhead
memorandum to the Bureau, dated 5/2/68, the New. Orleans
Council for Peaceful Alternatives (NOCPA) gathered at Audubon
Park, on 5/5/63, for the purpose of parading from Audubon
Park to Jackson Avenue along St. Charles Avenue. When it ~
was pointed out to the Chairman by the NOPD that their permit ,
to parade was for 5/3/63, when none of their members appeared,”
the group disbanded. Present at the time at Audubon Park
were a number of “right wing or conservative group" persons
who were going to.parade in opposition to the NOCPA. No
incidents happened at this time.

 

The NOCPA obtained a permit to parade on 5/19/63 ~°
from Pine Street to Jackson Avenue on St. Charles Avenue. -
They so'’paraded. The group consisted of about 40 persons
counting children and drew little attention. A group of
opposition persons tried, to parade, but were denied the
privilege since they had no permit. This group then drove +
a few blocks ahead of the parade, got out and stood on a a
corner with their signs and an American Flag until the NOCPA’

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

group passed. This procedure was repeated to the end of the’
parade. . . :
