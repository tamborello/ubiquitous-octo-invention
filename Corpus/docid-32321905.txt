Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act
of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The Act established the Assassination Records Review
Board (ARAB) to oversee the governments' production and
compliance with the Act. The ARAB reviews the proposed
postponements in documents sent by each agency to the National
Archive and Records Administration (NAIA) and decides what
postponements the Act allows or opens the document in full. The
ARAB's responsibilities include having agencies search other
subjects and areas to find any additional material not already
identified as assassination records. The establishment of the
ARAB by the Act also limited the time for their duties to be
accomplished. The ARAB must complete their tasks by September
1997. With this deadline in mind, the ARAB sent a letter

. requesting additional information.

 

Enclosures: ARRB letter requesting material .

Details: On March 10, 1997, the ARAB sent a letter to the FBI
setting forth a formal request to receive and review additional
records. The ARAB's goal is to research every possible subject
that may have a bearing on assassination theories and to assure
Congress and the American public that all was done to accomplish
the intentions of the Act.

 

Dallas should conduct a search of its office for the
listed items. If Dallas is aware of any administrative records
they may have maintained outside the normal index system, they
should include those areas in the search. If any documents
related to the matter are found, please forward the documents to
the JFK Task Force.

 

  

' Pursuant to the Act, any material categorized as an
sination record must be sent to the NARA in its original
form. The Act established the process of handling the documents
and the FBI must follow the Act. If Dallas believes their office
needs a copy, they should copy the document or material before
