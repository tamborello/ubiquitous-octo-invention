RE: SPENCER EUGENE ROBERTS

 

*

Rositzke stated that prior to being sent overseass
Roberts was put in contact with Department of State repre-
sentatives who helped prepare the latter for his Moscow
responsibilities as a Procurement Officer, Mr. Rositzke
vaguely remembered that a Mr. Stevens (phonetic) (First
Name Unknown) was one of those at the Department of State ul
who had dealt with Roberts during his pre-Moscow tradnings (gE '

Rositzke could not remember any details of reports
from Roberts as to the latter‘s activities in the USSR. He
vaguely remembered that CIA had sent some letters to Roberts
_in Moscow, through State Department channels, which Roberts
was to have mailed for the Agency but Rositzke could furnish
no information as to the purpose to have been served by the Ww
letters or the nature of the communications in question. (y (6-1) )

Rositzke did not remember any progress reports |
being submitted by. the Department of State on Roberts'*
assignment in Moscow but did recall having received a
memorandum from Walter Bedell Smith, then Ambassador to
Moscow, in which the Ambassador described Roberts as an
arrogant individual, critical of others in the Embassy and
that Roberts was not well liked by other Embassy personnel,
Roberts, according to Rositzke, was. reportedly reprimanded
by the Ambassador for this attitude, Later, Smith wrote
another report on Roberts describing the latter as having
impwoved in his role as a Department of State employee and
acting "like a member of the team." Rositzke commented that
soon after Walter Bedell Smith became Director of CIA he had
a briefing session with Smith; that he had been asked who
was responsible for Roberts‘ being sent abroad. Rositzke
accepted the responsibility for this and Smith, in a caustic

tone commented, "Orchids to yous" ¥) 6-1 glu

Rositzke stated it was his initial impression of
Roberts that the latter was a "delicate, sensitive person,"
extremely enamoured of all things dealing with Russian .
culture; that Roberts wanted to go to Russia where he believed
it would be possible to perform services. useful to the
government through his knowledge of the Russian language. (Y’ 64

Rositzke was aware that Roberts had transferred to
the Department of State around 1950 and was later released
from government service for homosexuality, .Rositzke stated
he was never aware that Roberts was involved in any homosexual
conduct while in CIA and was never aware that any CIA operations
were affected in any manner through Roberts! participation in

RE: SPENCER EUGENE ROBERTS

Rositzke believed Bat (Boland E, Dulin might have
been aware of Robertst role ii'Mdstow for CIA but he could
not speculate on the extent of Dulin's knowledge in this
regard, Rositzke added that Elizabeth Rausch was in his
office during the period of Roberts’ assignment in Moscow
and it was entirely possible that she knew of the latter's

activities ipebehalt of CIA, Rositzke did not be deve that he

Rositzke could not definitely remember whether or

On 6/1/45, Headquarters, Military District of |
Washington, forwarded to WFO a memorandum on ARTHUR. NORMAN
SHARP, ASN-31171664, born 5/10/99, West Somerville,
"Massachusetts, The memorandum in question was dated
5/2/45, and originated at the Tenth Naval District, San
Juan, Puerto Rico, It stated as follows: (xg ; |

"1, Information has been received from a source
rated A that ARTHUR NORMAN SHARPE, Sgt. U. S. ;
Army, stationed in Washington, D. C., home :
address, Windsor, Connecticut, has been, for a !
number of years, very pro-German and feels that i
the German people have been mistreated. It is {
reported that he is *angling' for a job with ‘
UNRRA to be stationed in Germany where he hopes {
to alleviate some of the injustices that have :
} been done to the German people, The informant
reported that his own relatives feel that SHARPE |
should not be given a position in which his i
feelings for the Germans could be exercised, “) :

The memorandum stated that more definite identifying
information regarding the above individual was not available. !
RUCE SOLIE, CIA, advised SA JOHN L, STANLEY on 4/22/63, that :
SHARP was not polygraphed re his homosexual behavior and there
was no formal report of SHARP's interview on 2/15/50, at which
time he resigned from the Agency; that there was no information
indicating homosexual acts by SHARP with other CIA personnel, G weet

On 4/23/63, BRUCE SOLIE, CIA, advised that his
office had not been able to locate copies of the letters
which ROBERTS was instructed to mail from Moscow but that
he would continue efforts to do so, 6-1) :

On 4/23/63, Mr, SOLIE made dvailable the security
file of ROBERTS. A perusal of the file indicated numerous
memoranda from ROBERTS while in Moscow, directed to ROSITZKE
-under the latters Agency cryptonym. It is of interest to’
note that ROSITZKE could recall no details regarding reports
from ROBERTS when it is realized that ROBERTS represented
CIA's initial efforts to place personnel in Moscow. It was
noted that several memoranda appeared in the file instructing © :
that certain sums of money be given ,to ELIZABETH RAUSCH, for

forwarding to ROBERTS in Moscow. es (5-t)() wy) :

Mr. Harry 2ositzke, Chief, Covert Activities/Staff,
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), advised a Special Agent of
the FBI on March 28, 1965, and April 5, 1963, that during the
period 1948 - 1950 he was Chief of Foreign Division/S in CIA
and as suchwas responsible for a number of Agency activities
involving the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, (w\G-t tA)

 

 
 

Rositzke advised that during the Summer of, Fall of
1947 Admiral dillenkotter, then Director of CIA, decided
that a CIA representative should be stationed in the Soviet
Union under suitable cover, It was made perfectly clear by
Admiral Hillenkotter that the employee, who was to be the
first such Agency representative in Moscow, would under no
circumstances be operational in behalf of CIA, (HE) tA)

The iusczuctions given, according to Rositzke, were
that Rositzke should find a person proficient in the Russian
language who would be suitable to fulfill a Department of

. State role in the American Embassy at Moscow, -Rositzke added
that during the 1947 - 1948 era the obvious place to search
for someone proticient in the Russian language was the Russian
language Institute at Columbia University and that it was his
recollection Spencer Eugene Roberts was ultimately selected
from the Institute as a candidate for the CIA position,
Rositzke could not remember the name of the CIA representative
who had conducted the preliminary work connected with the
recruitment of Roberts, Upon inquiry he stated he could not
recall Roland Ernest Dulin's having engaged in any role connected
with Roberts’ recruitment but Rositzke did not exclude this
possibility, mentioning that Dulin had been performing some
CIA personnel work during the late 1940s. Rositzke could not
recall William K. Harvey, a CIA official, having been connected

with the recruitment or training of Roberts.
