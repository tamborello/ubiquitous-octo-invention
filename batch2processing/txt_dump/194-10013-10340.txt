2, (cy GM. «es incarcerated during September 1957, as a direct :
result of information obtained from her during the course of ‘an interrogation
conducted by this Region. During the course of the interrogation, ae Was
of the opinion that she would receive a sentence from three to five years
for her activities in attempting to defect US Army pergonriel to the Bast
Zone. This office learned through its liaison contects that the maximum
sentence she would receive would be approximatély one yeer confinement.
Hence, this fact was used as a bargaining point to e&axtract a conféssion
from Giz]. She appeared to be extremely grateful to CIC because she was
of the opinion that because she told the truth concerning her activities,

GIC had interceded in getting her sentence reduced.

and mother. ‘When this happens, Region IV stands to benefit from any informa~
tion which she may obtain.

5. (c) appears to be. friendly, cooperative, and fearful of
returning to prigon. ‘She is of the opinion that should she continue her .
mission and come to the attention of CIC in unfavorable circumstances, she
would again be incarcerated.
