of HELEN WEYGANDT CARTER (known close friend of MEADOWS) that she
was presently living in Apartment 208, 1836 Stevens Forest Drive.
She had given the school a telephone number of WH 6-4458, but
this was later determined to be a nonexistent number.

On 9/7/62, the manager of the apartment house advised
that a Mr. and Mrs. JOHN L. CARTER resided in the apartment, that
the rent was paid every month in cash by Mr. CARTER, The manager
furnished a description of Mr. CARTER which matched that of BILLY
RAY GRIMES, She also identified a photograph of MEADOWS as a
person she has seen at the apartment house. The manager has
stated she would furnish any information she could develop con-
cerning MEADOWS, GRIMES and HELEN CARTER, especially telephone

TYREE LEONARD playing golf,

-On 9/7/62, Mrs. [ __|advised that FUQUA's wife had
told her that one of their neighbors was telling the FBI about
visitors they were having. FUQUA had told his wife that he had
learned this from a Dallas police officer who had told a friend
of FUQUA's that undoubtedly the FBI had somebody in the neighbor-
hood watching their residence. Mrs.[__]stated that the
FUQUAs did not suspect her because of their close past relation-
ship. ‘

During thecontact on 9/5/62, FUQUA furnished the follow-
ing information:

FUQUA advised that BILLY RAY DAVIS, .subject of Dallas
file 165-29, was in Las Vegas during the last week in August and
first week in September, during which time DAVIS telephonically
contacted FUQUA and claimed he was going to Kansas City from
Las Vegas. FUQUA advised that before leaving Dallas, DAVIS
had had a "line" on the exhibition football game between the
Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys. DAVIS had told FUQUA
he had obtained this line from sources in Las Vegas and from
GIL BECKLEY in Miami. FUQUA noted that Green Bay was a 10-point '

14-point favorite in Dallas.
