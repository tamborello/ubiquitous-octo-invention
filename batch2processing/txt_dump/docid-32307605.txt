ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS
‘The files in the Military and Naval Attachés!
offices ais well as the Embassy Central Files Section at

Habana falled to reflect any pertinent information on
subject./ This case is being closed at the present time
for t reason that, since the Russian Press Attache

RA PYCHEGODAEVA left Habana, subject's contacts with
the Legation have ceased, J Another basis for closing the

case is/the fact that she is no longer active in the affairs °,

of th VERSEAS NEWS AGENCY and. reliable sources disagree
on whether subject is actuaily a member of the Communist
Party. ; .

lonttaentiar Informant #656-1 points out in his
report that the police accused subject's brother of dis-
seminating seditious propaganda of a Communist type and that
other members of her family were arrested at different times.
It should be borne in mind that the modus operandi of the
MACHADO police in arresting revolutionists and members of
groups in opposition to him was to accuse them of having
disseminated Communist prepaganda which could be used as a
legal basis to incarcerate them or exile them from the
country as the Communist Party was operating illegally at
the time. This same modus operandi was used by the MACHADO
Regime to arrest many members of the opposition group who
are now and always have been violently opposed to Communism.
