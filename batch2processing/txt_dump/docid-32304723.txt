. Re Bureau airtel to Miami dated 1-23-63 captioned
"the Criminal Commission, et al., AR - Conspiracy.”

Enclosed for the Chicago and Hilwaukee Offices is
one copy each of the full test ef Ricole Gentile's manuscript,
portions of which are queted in report of SA James P. Flynn
dated 7+1468 at New York and captioned as above.

 

 

LO A review of the complete text of this manuscript by
the Chicago and Milwaukee Offices, together with material
already available under the above caption, should be helpful
in improving your perspective with regard to information now
being received frem MI 623-PC,and other sources, conceming
the captioned organization in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas.
It will be particularly interesting to note that Gentile, in
discussing travel to Milwaukee to contact the Milwaukee "famil
met with Vito Guardalabene and Joseph Vallone, the latter who
was referred to as the "vice capo" (underboss) of the Milwauke
“family” at that time. Gentile relates that Guardalabene then
traveled to Chicage with him te render suppert in a “ease”
Gentile was pleading with the “capo” (bess) of the Chicago
"family" at that time, D'Andrea. Et is noted that HI 623=PC
has discussed both Guardalabene and Yallone, referring to then
as past leaders of Milwaukee “family,” during Milwaukee's
initial discussions with this source concerning Cosa Nostra.

 

  
  
  
 

A review of this type material also is a reminder of
the urgent need for informant coverage at a sufficiently high
level to develop data on the leadership;. membership, activities,
etc,, of the Chicago group in Cosa Nostra. Et is noted that to
date the Bureau is aware of only three individuals conclusively
identified by Chicage as members of La Cosa Nostra, namely
Sam Giancena, Anthony Accardo, and Paul Ricca, A few other
