SJ T-1 advised on May 2, 1962 that he has decided
to furnish MACEO with the names of some 40 ex-rebel fighers,
now living in Puerto Rico. However, source stated he first
has to contact these 40 same individuals to determine if they
are interested in joining up with MACEO's group,

MACEO furnished SJ T-1 blank personnel data forms
to be filled out by those interested in joining his group.
These forms bear_the caption "ALIANZA REVOLUCIONARIA MILITAR
ANTI-COMUNISTA" (ARMA), which SJ T-1 assumes is the name of
MACEO's group, although MACEO has never specifically identified
his organization by name.

SJ T-1 stated that Lt. SAM and Captain ALAMO, mentioned
previously, were in the San Juan area in late March, 1962.
While here they stayed with Lt. NIETO. SJ T-1l has heard that
they were in contact with Colonel BARQUIN, at Mayaguez, Puerto
Rico. They also visited La Fortaleza, the Governor's Office
in Puerto Rico, but the source did not know whether they had
an interview with Governor LUIS MUNOZ MARIN.

On April 23, 1962 Golonel RAMON M, BARQUIN LOPEZ
advised that he is presently operating the Caribbean Military
Academy near Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. He noted that this is

a private school for boys from school grades 4th to llth.
Colonel BARQUIN noted this school is situated on some 35
acres of land on the site of the former Hotel Rosario, and
handles a maximum of 150 students.

Colonel BARQUIN stated that recently newspaper accounts
appearing in stateside papers allege that he has recently been
to South America. BARQUIN noted that this is not true and
the only place, outside of Puerto Rico, that he has visited in
recent months has been Florida. He made a two-day business trip
to Miami, Florida in April, 1962, whe he met some Cuban.
exile friends, particularly IGNACIO: ZA and JOSE MANUEL Ee

eéntered about Cuban matters and the hopes of freeing Cuba

of the CASTRO government. BARQUIN-stated that he had discussed
his personal opinion as to how the Cuban exiles should go

about the task of liberating Cuba and the Cuban people.

His general plans are as follows:

RE: ARMA

SJ T-1 statec that he, as an official of the MOVIMIENTO
RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIA (Revolutionary “iecupevation Movement)
(HRR) in Puerto Rico, has in the recent past assembled a listing
of some 475 youthful Cuban exiles presently living in Puerto Rico,
who had indicated to him that they are ready to fight in any —
manner, at any time, for the liberation of Cuba. His list
contains the names of some 4O to 60 former members of the Cuban
rebel army. .

SJ T-1 advised Lt. MACEOthat he had to know more
about MACEO's plan before he could turn over any list of names
to him and, primarily, he had to be personally satisfied that the
movement by MACEO's group was just not another Cuban exiles!
dream but in reality a true military movement with no political
connection and a movement backed 100 per cent by the U. S.
Government.

SJ T-1 stated to Lt. MACEO that he feels personally
responsible in Puerto Rico to the military use of the men who
have volunteered their services to the MRR and he is not going
to let them enter into any military action inside Cuba which
has no chanee of success from the very beginning; that is, a
military action without modern war equipment and supplies
which could only be furnished by the U. S. Government.

MACEO stated that he was not ab liberty to disclose
what backing his group had but indicated that the military
plans of his organization called for the use of American
M14 rifles and Belgium "FAL" guns. SJ T-1 stated that MACEO's
reference to the M14 rifles indicated to him that the U. Ss.
Government might be backing MACEO's group as such guns are
not available to the general public.

MACEO indicated a preference to the use of the Belgium
"FAL" guns as these are the same type of equipment presently
being used by CASTRO's forces, and if this group could capture
some Cuban arms and ammunitions they would be familiar with
the "FAL" equipment and could use any captured. ammunition.

MACEO indicated that his group is becoming active
in Tampa, Miami, New York City, and Puerto Rico. The Tampa

RE: ARMA

MACEO stated that his group has political Cuban exile
contacts working for them in Washington, D. C.3; however, no
names have been mentioned by MACEO.

SJ T-1 surmises that pr. FELIPEYEAzOs*ROQUE, former
Director of the National Bank of Cuba, and presently with the

Alliance of Progress in Washington, D. C., is the contact man ute saz

in Washington,

Whomever this unidentified Cuban exile official might
be in Washington, he is being asisted by several other Cubans
who are contacting representatives of other Latin American
governments in Washington, arranging for military backing and
training sites. MACEO has indicatéd to SJ T-1 that there would
be no training sites Jn either the United States or Puerto Rico.
MACEO advised that Lt. NIETO and he were going to visit
Colonel BARQUIN at Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, on Saturday, April 28,
1962, However, SJ T-1 subsequently advised on May 1, 1962 that
MACEO and NIETO had not gone to Mayaguez the previous Saturday
as planned.

On May 2, 1962 SJ T-1 stated that MACEO and he had
gone to Mayaguez late May 1, 1962, but upon arriving at BARQUIN's
residence they were informed by one of his assistants at the
Caribbean Military Academy that Colonel BARQUIN had left about
four days previously for Peru, Reportedly, BARQUIN then plans
to travel to Venezuela, then to Nicaragua, and back to Puerto
Rico. His contacts in the aforementioned countries are unknown
to SJ T-1 as well as his planned date of return.

MACEO plans to return to Miami, Florida, May 3, 1962.
MACEO has indicated to SJ T-1 that he would be in Miami only
a few days then was proceeding to some undisclosed training
camp outside the United States, (bs

St T-1l_ stated that he has referred Lt. MACEO
to HIGINIOW(NINO}ADIAZ of the MRR in Miami, to obtain his
permission to receive the complete list the MRR has compiled
of the Cubans ready to fight for the liberation of their country.

officer in the MOVIMTENTO. RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIO (Revolution=

ary Recuperation Movement) (MRR), Puerto Rico Section,

It would appear from a review of the attached
information furnished by SJ T-l that the operation of. HUBERT
MATOS' men in Florida is possibly connected with the activities
of the "EJERCITO LIBERTADOR DE CUBA" (Liberation Army of: Cuba),

referred to in WFO letters dated 3/29 and 4/27/62 under that
caption,

Possibly, instead of Dr. FELIPEZ PAZOS ROQUE, ERNESTO
BETANCOURT of the Pan American Union, is the Washington contact
man of the ARMA.

. The letterhead is being submitted under the caption
ALIANZA REVOLUCIONARIA MILITAR ANTI-COMUNISTA(ARMA), as this
Spanish caption appears on the military personnel forms being
used by Lt. MACEO in Puerto Rico. SJ T~1 stated that MACEO
brought these printed forms from Miami, Florida.

“~-INS files at Santurce, Puerto Rico, contain no
reference’ or a 1962 alien registration card on MANUEL NIETO,
a former Lieutenant of HUBERT MATOS, who is mentioned in the

Government and who subsequently became a Lieutenant in the
rebel forse of HUBERT MATOS, operating in Oriente Province,
Cuba, prior to FIDEL CASTRO's assumption of power on January l,

with Captain ALAMO, another former HUBERT MATOS officer,
escaped with some other 13 individuals from La Cabana Prison
in Havana in early, 1961. All of the 15 individuals who
escaped at this time, according to SJ T-l, were members of
HUBERT MATOS army.

FIDEL CASTRO in joint military action against the BATISTA
Governiiént’ prior to January, 1959. MATOS was subsequently
imprisoned by FIDEL CASTRO and now is confined on the Isle
of Pines, Cuba. .

Lt. MACEO told SJ T-1. that he needed his assistance
in identifying. and contacting useful Cuban exiles of
reliable reputation who are willing and ready to fight against
the CASTRO Government inside Cuba in the near future. MACEO
stated that he was particuarly interested in contacting former
members of the Cuban-rebel army now residing in Puerto Rico.
