Farmer OF member _

Regarding MANUEL RRERAMWNGELES, the Mexico City
daily, "El Universal," dated May 20,191, stated that MANUEL
HERRERA ANGELES, Secretary of Internal Affairs of the School-
teachers Union, and three others had, on the previous day, sent
to the National Congress of the Communist Party of Mexico their
resignations as members of this Party. They gave as their reasons
that the Communist Party of Mexico had not been properly organized,
former vices had not been corrected, and they were not in accord
with its policy regarding international affairs.

The Mexico City daily, "La Prensa," dated May 18, 19h,
carried an article reportedly based on information furnished by
some members of the Schoolteachers Union regarding the Communist
we CEOUP within this union. This stated that at a secret session !
© of the Communist teachers, some were awarded the Dionisio Encina
"medal" as prizes, Among those listed by the artifle as receiving
this medal were MA LL HERRERA ANGELES and RODOLFOAENCISQ.= N\ey ;

   
    
 

DIONISIOAENCINA has been Secretary Generalof._the Mexican _
Communist Party since 190... However, this office has never heard
of a Dionisio Encina "medal," other than in the article mentioned
above. ,

The files of this office contain inform'ton attributed
to SIS-239 in early 1945 that JACO RWITZ was instrumental in
the formation of a book club under ths name of Club del Libro "Mexico.|
Among the numerous members listed was the name MANUEL HERRERA ANGELES ;:
Rio Blanco #190, Mexico, D. F. HURWITZ has been identified as a.
long-time 2 Gomintern agent.

 

The files further reflect that RODOLFO ENCISO was one of
the promoters of the American Continental Congress for Peace held
in Mexico City September 5 - 11, 1949. Legat and Embassy files
contain no addition inf, rmation on either MANUEL HERRERA ANGELES
or RODOLFO ENCISO, X-l4has advised that neither of these men $
tines] (i have any Communist connections or sympathies at ta
ime.
