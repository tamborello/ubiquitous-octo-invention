FBI. The Kansas City Office is not aware of the full extent
of efforts by the New York and Chicago’ Offices to develop
WILLIAMSON as a source in this matter, nor is it readily
apparent what services he can perform relative to the subject,
other than the possible defection of PHYLLIS MC GUIRE. From
the information available it would appear that a possible
current solution would be arrangements for a contact point
away from either Chicago or New York City. MARTIN's reluc-
tance to become involved-in this matter appears to dictate
against his continued use as a third party. Ww

.

furnish Kansas City with background information concerning
this matter and specific recommendations as to the action

The New York and Chicago Offices are requested to |
Kansas City should take in this matter. (6)

' 1 his information should be furnished Kansas City
by return mail as WILLIAMSON is expected in Wichita, Ks., in
the very near future. (We)

: In about 1954, or yéar of the Oklahoma Centennial,
the McGuire Sisters (DOROTHY, CHRISTINE, and PHYLLIS) were
under contract to appear in Oklahoma City, professionally, in
connection with the Oklahoma celebration, Just before their
appearance CHRISTINE contracted a "strep" throat and immed-
iately returned to New York City for treatment. The management
in Oklahoma thought the McGUIRE sisters had breached their
contract and threatened legal action. [w)

LOWELL WILLIAMSON, by. this time, was married to
DOROTHY MC GUIRE, and in an effort to save his wife and her —
h sisters legal difficulty WILLIAMSON contacted MARTIN and
requested him to attempt to straighten out the matter in ,
Oklahoma. MARTIN was successful in making a satisfactory
settlement in behalf of the MC GUIRE sisters and. was subse- . :
quently engaged by them to handle the writing of all special i
contracts they entered into in the entertainment field. | iL)

As result of this legal business MARTIN has become
personally acquainted with the MC GUIRE sisters and some of ;
their friends. Some months ago, at the request of WILLIAMSON,
MARTIN was in New York City and had dinner with the MC GUIRE
sisters, along with WILLIAMSON, MARTIN, at -the request of
WILLIAMSON, was supposed to discreetly suggest to PHYLLIS that
she should stop keeping company with subject, who until just
recently was known to WILLIAMSON and the other two sisters as :
SAM MOONEY, and SAM FLOYD, MARTIN made the effort, but as he
anticipated it did little good as PHYLLIS would not listen to

his admonitions. j We) \

In tne SY came, WILLIAMSON was able to determine
some of the background of subject and on one recent occasion
declared in the presence of subject that he did not approve
of the activities of subject, whereupon subject commented in
substance he was not interested in what WILLIAMSON approved

of. Ww

( WILLIAMSON has in the past expressed some fear of
the subject, especially as it concerns his children and
wife, pointing out his wife is away from him a great deal
and in view of her contact with -PHYLLIS would be at the
mercy of subject should he decide to cause her bodily harm.

On About Saturday, May 25, 1963, WILLIAMSON, who now
lives in Calgary, Alb. Canada, and is becoming a Canadian
citizen, called MARTIN at. Wichita, and confided he had been
interviewed by the FBI, a Mr. CHARLES CONNERLY (phonetic) in
the New York City Office, and certain information concerning
the activities of subject was requested. (W)

. WILLIAMSON agreed to cooperate, but on further
reflection questioned the wisdom of the decision in view of
the reputation of the subject. He therefore called MARTIN i
and asked his advice as his attorney. (we)

. WILLIAMSON told MARTIN he spends a lot of time on
business-.in New York City and Chicago, and absolutely refuses
to consider any contacts with the FBI in either of those
cities. WILLIAMSON has a strong desire to assist the FBI in ‘
any way possible including taking considerable risk to himself.
He expressed a desire to MARTIN to supply the desired informa-
tion through MARTIN and have MARTIN furnish the information, to ‘
the FBI at the Wichita level. MARTIN explained that apparently
WILLIAMSON feels he is too well known in Chicago or New, York
City to make any contacts with the FBI, He also does not want
his wife to know anything about his contacts with the FBI as
he does not feel she would understand and would probably, through
inadvertence, mention it to PHYLLIS. (w)

MARTIN pointed out he was well aware this would not |
be a satisfactory arrangement as he is gone from Wichita, and
his whereabouts would not always be known to WILLIAMSON.
Further, MARTIN has no desire to inject himself in this matter
and would prefer to have no part in it other than to represent
the best interests of his client. MARTIN observed he thought
however, he could influence WILLIAMSON to make any arrangement
the FBI might desire other than to be contacted in New York City

_or Chicago. ic?

MARTIN said WILLIAMSON is expected in Wichita in the
\ very near future and he would arrange for a detailed interview
of his client and would recommend to WILLIAMSON any course of
action deemed satisfactory by the FBI except a Chicago or New
York City contact. We) .

It is the opinion of the Kansas City Office that
MARTIN will cooperate fully with this office in suggesting
We to WILLIAMSON any appropriate course of action desired by the
