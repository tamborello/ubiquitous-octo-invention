Technicalities on which subject's expatriation case.
ordered reopened deal with fact that subject repeatedly took:
5th Amendment to questions asked of him at previous hearing
and PEDRO DIAZ LANZ did not testify on subject's behalf~
although he was supposed to have done so. Case was- ordéred
‘reopened to hear testimony of those two persons which,
according to the..INS official handling matter, is very
unusual and not acording to precedent. It is noted that
when SA KELLOGG saw subject at home of PEDRO DIAZ LANZ,
subject was casually questioned about the status of his
expatriation and without being specific he said he was rather
confident that it would be taken care of and indicated it
was being taken care of "in Washington."

Instant case is s being closed in view of apparent
inactivity on part of subject individually and in view of

' fact his only anti-CASTRO activity is apparently in conjunction

with DIAZ LANZ whose activities are presently being reported
in the case on DIAZ LANZ, ‘Organization, the CCC (Cuban
Constitutional Crusade), and case on the unity group which
includes his organization, the Liberation Alliance. Coverage
of activities of PEDRO DIAZ LANZ and his organization will
be followed in future inoane or) ‘more of those cases so long
as the situation calls -for such coverage and it is believed
such coverage will adequately cover subject. If situation
so dictates, 8separate case on subject will be reopened.
