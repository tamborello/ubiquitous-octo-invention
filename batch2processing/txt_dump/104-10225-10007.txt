You have just completed, at my direction, seven weeks
. Of full-time service on the GS-13 Clandestine Service
. Personnel Evaluation Board. I know that this work has been
, particularly demanding. Your partictpation and diligent
application of your professional experience have been
decisive factors in the successful accomplishment of the

Board's missions.

 

cen In the course of this assignment you have become
thoroughly familiar with the use and interpretation of per-
sonnel files and personnel practices of the Clandestine
Service, Having reviewed and analyzed the files of
or more CS officers, you have had to make judgments
and recommendations concerning their relative-ranking and
their qualifications for promotion, for training required
to overcome a deficiency or.enhance career effectiveness,
for changes of assignment to further career development and
for Quality Step Increases to recognize outstanding perform=
ance, - In so doing, you have carefully studied the career
development of a large number of officers in a11 components
ef the CS, both as individuals and in relationship to each
other in terms of morit and value to the Clandestine Service.

 

 

 

 

 

You have become familiar with a broad spectrum of
personnel and administrative problema on a practical working
level and have acquired a knowledge of personnel management
which will better equip you to handle supervisory positions
which require personnel reporting and career development of
subordinates, The committee format of the panels has also
deepened your understanding of the conference approach to

Management probloms.
