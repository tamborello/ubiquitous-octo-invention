MM 105-2484

CONTE had not talked about CASTRO nor attacked him. CONTE had =
merely stated there were some Communtsts in the Cuban Govern-
ment. He said EMILIO suspects CONTE may be a "plant" for some
unknown purpose, possibly similar to that played by WILLIAM

ALEXANDER MORGAN in the Trinidad incident,on behalf of CASTRO.

It is to be recalled that WILLIAM ALEXANDER MORGAN, a
former United States adventurer, participated in the double-
cross at Trinidad, Cuba, which resulted in the apprehension
and death of a number of anti-CASTRO revolutionists.

On April 15, 1960, MM 715-S, who is in close contact
with various officials of the CASTRO government, stated he had no rea-
son to suspect that CONTE AGUERO is a "plant" for the Cuban
Government.

On the same date, MM 639-S, who is also in close
contact with a number of Cuban officials, including several who
are engaged in intelligence activities, advised that he had
received no information indicating that CONTE is working for the
Cuban Government surreptitiously.

couc est) l

On April. 15, 1960, Colonel MARIANO FAGET, PSI, “former :
Chief of the Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities
(BRAC), and who is. closely associated with most of the leading
anti-CASTRO leaders in the Miami area, advised that he had heard
rumors concerning the possibility that CONTE might be a "plant" ;
of the CASTRO government. He said that he had made a number of
inquiries and had turned up no information which would tend to a
support such a suspicion. He expressed the opinion that CONTE SS
is ninety-five per cent (95%) against CASTRO.
