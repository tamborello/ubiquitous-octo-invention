From sources to this Department, it has been gleaned that
Joseph Francisco Mario “EANDINO arrived at Heathrow Airport, London
via NeycYane Gr FFiday, 12 12th December, 1975 on an Air India Flight.
He then went to the Cotteridge Hotel, Woking, Surrey where he booked

in a single room until Sunday, 14th December, 1975. It is not’ known
who LANDINO met during this three day stay but it is known that he {
then flew out from Heathrow Airport at 1900 hours 6n a Swiss Air
flight bound for Zurich. He returned to the United Kingdom the
following day and apparently returned to the Cotteridge Hotel.
According to sources within the hotel, LANDINO was booked to return
to the United States on Wednesday, 17th December, 1975 and that at
about noon LANDINO checked out of the hotel, apparently in something
of a hurry, stating to. the hotel employees that he was leaving for

Heathrow Airport. Nothing further can be traced at this stage as to

LANDINO's movements in this country. Extensive enquiries have been
made in an effort to trace and identify the nature. of the business
that LANDINO has been sent over to settle.

It must be emphasised that the following inforriation is
supposition only and eannot be proved in any way.

’ From the description given of the individual ,who arivea—
Rolls “Royee and spends a great deal of time in Fr e, it is of the
opinion .that this could be a man called Jud STOCK, the former
owner of the Victoria Sporting Club, who I5 reputedly a millionnaire
of Jewish background and a qualified solicitor. BINSTOCK has been
involved in.several business enterprises in France where he lives,
at 49 Avenue Foch, Parisi 16. It is understood by this Department
that he has also been to Miami on several occasions where he has many
associates, some possibly involved with the Miami Crime Syndicate. :
Further, it is understood that BINSTOCK is a member of the Miami Turf
Club.

; . yo (oe

There are no criminal convictions recorded against BINSTOCK
but he is well known to this Department because of his suspected
association with members of organise érime syndicates, one of whom
is known to be the notorious DigaheEicant, who is undoubtedly already
well known to your Organised Crime Department in Washington. There
is no trace of BINSTOCK recently visiting the U.K. and efforts are
continuing to establish, if it is indeed BINSTOCK who is the man
involved, as to what business it was that caused LANDINO to be sent
to this country. :
