recalled hew conservative MOLINA is yet he was questioned.

Ig JOE MOLINA had been questioned, GONZALEZ said, what could he ~~
and LANDIN expect since they were really outspoken (when they
attended forum meetings). GONZALEZ thought that BILL LOWERY ha
given MOLINA’s name to the FBE together vith all of the forun

menbers' names. He said he was going to Washingten to see if he | ‘

was on the subversive list. He was pretty sure that he could not
get that information there. LANDIN recalled that GONZALEZ knew
BUBY and that sometime ago (4 years age) he (ALBEBT GONZALEZ)

had told LANDIS that RUBY was an ex-labor organizer and was

‘no good." GONZALEZ said he did know RUBY and had recently%spoken
to Mrs. GRANT, his sister at the Vegas Club. He is interested ,
in buying the elub. : :

; Informant determined that ESTRADA warned LANDIN not to
give too much of his time to him for he is krown to twist things
around and could be 4 dangerous character. He could be working
for someone at that very moment, that 4s, as an informer. After
