VIII. MISCELLANEOUS

The West German Federal Criminal Police (BKA)
advised that the Munich, Germany Police Department had
contacted HELMUT MAIER on April 13, 1962, and attempted
to solicit information from him in regard to GUS ALEX.
MAIBR is the ex-husband of SUZANNE FUEGER, paramour of
ALEX. MAIER said that he was then employed by the export
firm of Massrs. Linde and that his employers intended to
send him to the United States in the future to represent
them there. As a result, he declined to furnish any
information in regard to GUS ALEX on the basis that he
desired to protect himself from any possible future
retaliations against him. The BKA informed that MAIER
was born May 18, 1929, in Munich, Germany, and was residing
at 200 Saebenerstrasse, C/O Haeussler, Munich 9, Germany,
and that he was divorced on May 25, 1962, from DIETGARD
ROSEMARIE MAIER, nee FEUGER. The BKA advised that DIETGARD
MAIER was born December 3, 1938, at Seewalchen, Austria,
and that her mother's name was ELROSE FUEGER, 12 Rosenstrasse,
Munich, Germany.
