individuals were doing for CIA in 1963-64, as well as what they are now doing and
where they are presently located. We would also appreciate it if you would identify
which of these are true names and which are pseudonyms.

. As always, please‘do not hesitate to contact me or Jeremy Gunn for any clarification

regarding these requests.
With many thanks for your cooperation. *
Sincerely yours,

will be presented to the Board at its January meeting. Accordingly, these
materials must be ready for the Review Board staff by January 12, 1998.
CIA-2 through CIA-5.

These requests have been completed and no further action is needed by CIA.

 

“*CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches.

The Review Board first made this request on September 11, 1995. On

September 11, 1995, CIA agreed to make these materials available by December
1995. On October 1, 1996, CLA agreed to make these materials available by
November 1996. Most recently, CIA has stated that these cables are not available
as a chronological group; if it is not possible or is unduly burdensome to retrieve
these cables, CIA should write a memorandum to that effect.

We are aware that many of the cables requested are already in the JFK files, but -
not all are included. Those that we have not been able to.locate in the collection
include: Mexico City Station to Headquarters (September 26-30, 1963); ©
Headquarters to Mexico City Station (September 26-30, 1963); JMWAVE to
Headquarters (September 26-November 21, 1963); Headquarters to JMWAVE
(September 26-November 21, 1963); and all traffic between the Mexico City ©
Station and JMWAVE for the periods September 26-October 20, 1963 and
November 22-December 30, 1963. :

CIA-7 Histories.

The Review Board first requested access to several internal CIA histories and to
indices of histories on November 8, 1995. On August 8, 1996, after reviewing a
list of histories that CLA provided, the ARRB staff designated approximately
sixty histories for which further review was sought. To date, the ARRB staff has
reviewed twelve histories that CLA has made available and has made ~
suggestions with respect to further processing of some of those histories. The
ARRB staff appreciates the cooperation it has received from HRG in our review
of the histories. CLA should continue to make the remaining histories available
on a continuing basis in consultation with the ARRB.
