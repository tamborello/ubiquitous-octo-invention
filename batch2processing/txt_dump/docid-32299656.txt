ANGELO BRUNO, aka
AR
00: Phila.

ReBuairtel to Phila., cc Miami, 9/24/63.

Reairtel instructs Phila. to request Miami to
handle interview of BERNARD BUCKY ALLEN and to furnish Miami
with suitable background data. Miami has sufficient background
data, noting that all copies ‘of reports re ANGELO BRUNO have
been forwarded that Division due to his extensive activities
in the Miami Division's territory.

Of importance in utilizing polygraph technique
to interview ALLEN was an attempt to have ALLEN admit that he
was in a position to testify to information which he had previ-
ously furnished. ALLEN has taken the position during the
previous interviews that he believed certain information, such
as investments’: in the Dominican Republic by BEN GOLOB and
others was in part BRUNO's money. He has, however, always
claimed that he had no concrete information in this regard
and only believed these situations to be true.

Phila., for example, knows that BEN GOLOB is Yi)
very talkative in regard to his relationship with ANGELO BRUNO '

when conversing with individuals he trusts, such as PH 614-C-TE.
It is felt he would take this same position and furnish consider-
able information of value to the FBI in his conversations with

Phila. has always been at a disadvantage when inter-
viewing ALLEN inasmuch as he was always preoccupied with his
employment as Manager of World of Mirth,,Shows ey in a travel
