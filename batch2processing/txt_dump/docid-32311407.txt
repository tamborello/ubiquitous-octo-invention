THE NATURE OF THE ASSISTANCE SMALL GIVES TO THE AMERICAN
COMMUNISTS WHO, WHEN VISITING MEXICO, APPEAR AT HIS PLACE OF
BUSINESS, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR SURVEY OF KEY INFORMANTS
CONCERNING OSWALD REFERRED TO IN YOUR CABLE NUMBER FIVE EIGHT ONE
SET FORTH IN LETTERHEAD RE SNALL TH NUMBER OF SOURCES WHO COULD
"FURNISH NO INFORMATION TO INDICATE THAT OSWALD EVER APPEARED AT
SHALL'S STORE, HANDLE IMMEDIATELY, ~~~

NOTE: a) (u.)
fix 18 and Mex 1 @ part of a gre .
Mexi@o City active in‘tommunist circles at Co. ode

One of these individuals is Charles Smali-who,;-in-December-and

January, told the informants that he was worried about possible oh

harassment by Mexican police as he considered it possible Oswald

may have visited his jewelry store when in Mexico. No info has 4
been developed to establish that such-was the case and Small has «
not indicated to sources that he, in fact, knew or met Oswald,

Snall claimed to sources that he was out of Mexico during Oswald's ;

trip to Mexico City; however, the sources report that Small reterned .

to Mexico, exact date not statet, prior co the time Gswald
reportedly left Mexico. In view cf Commission's intense interest

. in identifying all places visited by Oswald in Mexico City, we

‘regard it as likely they will ask that Small be interviewed.

- Legat's 4-9 airtel recommended against this as interviewing his.
about Oswald and a possible visit to Small's store would poine %<
the informants as sources, Furthermore, Small has heart cond
Believed advisable to alert Legat to possibility of request i<

interview of Small and to have him thinking as to bést means to

.accomplish this, Requested inquiry if negative and if ‘we can
show Small was in US during S-day period %swald was in Mexico,
may forestall request for interview of Small. Informants believe
that Small's fear..of Mexican police harassment was part of the
general concern t¢ members of the American communist group in.
