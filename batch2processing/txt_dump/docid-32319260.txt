DETAILS: The JFK Task Force uses two distinct computer
operations (1) the inventorying of each document in each of our
files and (2) the creation of Identification Aids.

Operation #1 is using R-Base via token ring to store
for later research the description of each document. Eight IWS
computers are available to create the inventory. During the day
shift (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.) five of the eight computers are used to
enter/edit inventory data. The other three computers are used by
analysts to inquire about the data stored. During the night
shift (4 p.m. - midnight) four employees are entering or editing
data. During the midnight shift (midnight - 8 a.m.) two
employees are entering data. At times (normally 3 - 4 times per
week) the hardware and/or software is unresponsive and we cannot
enter data. This requires technical adjustment by Manfred
Patterson or Carrie Perry. When more than two people are making
inquiries we usually experience delays as the computer searches
for the document we need. We are told that the delays are the
result of the inadequate size of the R-Base and/or the result of
too many people inquiring at one time.

Memorandum from Terry T. O’Connor to Mr. Baugh, dated 9/20/93
Re: Operational Status of Computer

Hardware/Software

JFK Task Force

The JFK Task Force began using computers for Operation
#1 in August, 1992, and the Task Force was advised that R-Base
was the most logical storage mechanism which was available to the
FBI for our inventory which inventory would eventually exceed
157,000 documents. Jack Sobolewski and Manfred Patterson have
provided excellent computer support for the task force and they
have always responded promptly to any requests for assistance.
Mr. Patterson has even split the database in two components to
help us expedite our searches. The Task Force recommended and it
was approved that Mr. Patterson receive an on-the-spot award for
his work in writing a software program to support the inventory
process. In the past three months Carrie Perry has worked with
Manfred Patterson to solve problems when the computers’ become -
unresponsive.

Mr. Sobelewski has suggested‘that.a file server will
speed up the response time and reduce errors but will not solve
all problems. Software problems might continue to exist. They
also noted that the file server is very expensive and has already
been previously requested by Carey Linton for other applications.

We are presently having no trouble with the computer
hardware used in Operation #2. Operation #2 requires the
creation and placement of data (Identification Aids) on a disk
using software designed by the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA). NARA provides the disks for the software
which was designed in December, 1992 (and updated in June and
September, 1993). Nine IWS computers are being used to enter
this data onto the disks. These computers are all on loan to the
JFK Task Force from the Executive Agencies Dissemination Unit.
Beginning 9/13/93, we will have approximately 20 people creating
Identification Aids in rough draft and nine people entering the
data.
