Mr. Johnston.

 

Now, let me ask you. Mr. Rocea, who follewdau

    

you with the Kennedy case, dates his involvement as about Januany

  
 
 

23rd, 1964.

 
  
 
 
  
 

  

Mr. Scelso. That is possible. The. turning point came

when XE finished an initial report on the case and distributed

 
 

it to the people who were concerned within the Agency. °

Mr. Johnston. How large was that report? |

  
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
   
   
   
  

Mr. Scelso. Oh, it might have been 20 Pages long,. and
summarized all of the things which we had discovered abroad.
Just at the time that this report was being finished and was
being circulated, Mr. Nicholas Katzenbach notitiéd the Agen.
that the FBI or Department of Justice report on the case was”
finished, and invited the Agency to send representatives to
read it in his office.

I went over -- Mr. Helms assigned me and one other

gentleman to go read.it.

dir. Johnston. Who was the other man?

 

Mr. gcelso. Mr. Burch O'Neal, of the Counterintelligenc

Starz.

We went to Mr. Katzenbach's office in the Oepartment of

Justice and read this very thick report. For the first time,

T learned a myriad of vital facts about Oswald's background

 

which apparently the FBI had known throughout the initial

I would like to add that in the initial. phase of the
investigation, when I was commissioned with the job, Mr. Kelms
called me and Mr. Karamessines and Mr. Angleton and a number of
others into his office and told them in the clearest terns
‘possible that I was to be in charge of the investigation, that
no one in the Agency was to have any conversations with anyone

outside the Agency, including the Warren Commission and the

 

Federal Bureau of Investigation, concerning the Kennedy assassi
nation without my being present. I was to be told and given an
Opportunity to go to everything.

I did talk to members of the Warren Commission. I an

the entire period discussed the Kennedy assassination regularly;

with FBI representatives, never notified me of any of these

meetings, and never passed on to me any of the information that
he yained in these meetings.

The Bureau did send us, during this initial period --

Senator SChweiker. Now, wait a minute.

What period of time is this you are saying?

Mr. Scelso. This is the period of time --

Senator Schweiker. When you were in charge of it?

six. Scelso. When I was in charge of the investigatiun.

Senator Schweiker. What would have been his role or

And. Mr. King in turn answered to the ppp.

 

Mr. Johnston.

  
 
 

Mr. Scelso. The ppp was Mr. Helms.

 

I might add that all. statements 1 make in this matter

 

 

 

are based on purely my menory, because I had Aittie or no

 

  

 

contact with the Oswald Lnvegtigation, the Keniiedy investigatio

  
  

after the end of 1963, and I have not reviewed any records at

Senator Schweiker. was this because of a transfer of |
duty or assignment or what? |

|

Mr. Scelso. It was because the investigation was turnes

 

over to another staff in the Agency, to the Counterintelligens. |

Staff. I can explain why it was turned over in much more

  

detail if you'd like.

 

Senator Schweiker. Well, maybe briefly, if you would,

 

   

Mr. Scelso. I was put in charge of the investigation in

 
 

the first place because of the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald i
