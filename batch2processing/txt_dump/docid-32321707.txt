Mr. Roger S. Peterson

Rocklin, California 95677-1837

Dear Mr. Peterson:

This is in response to Senator Dianne Feinstein’s July 17th inquiry to the
Department of Justice, which was forwarded to the FBI, regarding your letter to her dated
April 28, 1997.

As stated in your letter, the Assassination Records Review Board (the Board) was
scheduled to be defunct as of September 30, 1997. President Clinton signed a law authorizing a
one-year extension for the Board for Fiscal Year 1998. It is Public Law 105-25. However, due
to other legislation tied into the same bill, the appropriations have not yet been signed.
