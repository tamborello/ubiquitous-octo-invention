30 April 1997

Note for the Record
Subject: CIC Oswald/Nosenko related soft files:

1. Warren Commission/Oswald
2. Documents Yuri Ivanovich NOSENKO/Oswald

1. I advised SA/CIC, that most of the
documents in the two folders are duplicates of documents in

the CIA JFK Collection sequestered by the HSCA. The other

 

' documents are related to Nosenko, but do not, mention Oswald.

These documents are probably duplicated in the Nosenko
material set aside for discussion with the ARRB. I
recommended that we make the folders available to the ARRB
staff. She concurred. :

2. Documents will be made available. to Michelle Combs,
ARRB staff, on her next visit.
