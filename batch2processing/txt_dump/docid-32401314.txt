Cuba: Fidel Castro's two-hour speech of 23
November on President Kennedy's assassination re-
flects apprehension that US policy toward Cuba may
become even tougher than in the past. He pointed
out that President Kennedy's alleged promise not to
invade Cuba has been strongly attacked by "reaction-
aries" and stated that the President's death could
lead from a bad situation to a worse one. Mean-
while, the Cuban defensive military alert, ordered
immediately after the President's death, remains
in effect. (SECRET KIMBO)
