In connection with the influence of the Calabrese group
headed by ANTHONY MILANO of Cleveland, CV 344-C gave the
following as an illustration: : .

He stated that in about 1958 he backed a sheriff's
candidate in Mansfield, hoping that if he was elected he would
be able to open a house of prostitution in Mansfield and within
the jurisdiction of the sheriff. The candidate was elected
without any support whatsoever of TONY MOLLICA. He started his
house of prostitution, which was a. money making proposition and
shortly thereafter MOLLICA approached. him and told him that
people in town were talking and saying that he, MOLLICA, was
responsible for the house being able to operate and it was
giving him a bad name because 'members" are not.supposed to
engage in prostitution. Informant told MOLLICA that he had
nothing to worry about as he was not. involved, and it then
became apparent that MOLLICA was trying to get part of the
operation and profit. MOLLICA then, turned to MIKE ROMEO of
Poland, Ohio, brother of PAUL ROMEO of Campbell, who: was a
friend of informant's father,. and ROMEO called on the informant on
behalf of MOLLICA. -ROMEO told informant that’ he was. “out of line"
and was giving MOLLICA a'bad reputation in that he had moved
_into MOLLICA's territory. ROMEO told CV.:344-c to close the
house for a couple of months so that everything would "cool" down.
Informant refused and told ROMEO he was not out of line and
secured his own "fix". by backing the sheriff in the election and
the sheriff wanted nothing to do with. MOLLICA and would not ;
allow him to operate anything. Informant stated: he. was mad. about
this interference and then wrote a letter to his father in :
Buenos Aires and later received an answer to the letter... With
the answer he was. instructed to.take the letter to-PINDELLI's
good friend, ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland, and according to.
CV 344-¢c; he did-this. A. couple of days: later informant. was
called. by "WHITEY" BESASE, who instructed him to come to- :
Akron to the home of JAMES LA FATCH for a meeting. He was told
to come there with MOLLICA, but. informant .refused stating he. was
not going to.be "dumped" en route or at. the meéting. He then
called MILANO in the presence of MOLLICA and told MILANO what
they wanted of him. :
