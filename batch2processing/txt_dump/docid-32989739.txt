Re Louisville airtel to Bureau dated 3/4/69.

On 4/24/69 RICHARD. MURZYN was interviewed by Bureau Agents and
advised no hard feelings exist between him and Sgt. HARDIN and
added that he knows of no deal which caused him to leave the
Louisville, Ky. area. MURZYN advised he was last in Louisville,
Ky. six or seven months back checking on rumors that his son
was being mistreated by his ex-wife. MURZYN advised he was in
Louisville immediately before Christmas, December, 1964 with tvo
white males, one TONY ANDREWS (Dalton, Illinois, (killed in gun-
fight in Dalton, Ill. area) and ROSS HERMAN (now in California).
MURZYN advised this trip was to deliver Christmas presents to
his son and that he only stayed overnight and knows of no
information of anyone attempting to dynamite HARDIN's vehicle.

During conversation MURZYN indicated dynamiting was not his
specialty, but if he was after someone he would do it with a
high powered rifle. MURZYN indicated that he felt he and HARDIN
were still on friendly terms. HURZYN added he plans to go to
the Kentucky Derby this year with 2 JAMES WHITAKER, a lawyer
from Hammond, Indiana: RICHARD RANKIE, car salesman from Chicago,
and JANES WARGO, insurance salesman from Whiting, Indiana. He
added he intends to take several shotguns with him to engage in
a trap shooting contest with some friends from the Louisville
