“Le Tt is believed that the lack of. the traditional exchange of Christmas

greetings between the Mexican Government and the Cuban Embassy was
| -the result of the resentment caused among Mexican officialdom by the
‘strong note dated 26 November 1963, received by the Mexican Ministry
of Foreign Relations from Raul Roa Garcia, Cuban Minister of Foreign
Relations, over the detention by Mexican authorities of Silvia Tirado
de Duran, Mexican employee of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, in —

of the United States. ae ‘ .

2 It is believed that the Cuban Government's refusal to give Del Rio a

visa is also related to Roa's note and the Cuban Government's desire to
- avoid antagonizing the. Mexican Government further.
