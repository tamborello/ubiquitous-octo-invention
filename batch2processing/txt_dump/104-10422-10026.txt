‘The Ambassador's suspicions, cited above, were fueled
two days later, on November 25, when Gilberto Nolesco Alvarado-
Ugarte, a-twenty-three year old Nicaraguan national AppddAtdd
telephoned the American Embasssy in Mexico City. He chaimed

that on 18 September he saw Lee Oswald receive six thousand

five hundred dollars in meeting inside the Cuban Embassy,
Mexico City. (CIA Docs. IN 68291, 11/26/63) ALsAtAdS/ te?

as "Juan-Jose" came out of the office and asked Alvarado for his
photographs. Because he needed to go to a bathroom, Alvarado
asked this man where one was located; he was shown through a door.
to a passageway leading to the patio. While standing by the
bathroom door, Alvaradg saw_a group of three persons talking
on the patio a few feet away... One man was a tall, thin, red-haired
negro, Le . The third man was dressed in a black sportcoat,
