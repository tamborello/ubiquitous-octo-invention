There appear to be no significant documents in this file but

it should be noted that while there are numerous memoranda
for the record in the earlier years, there is only one document
for 1972. In that document, during a meeting with Helms in
early 1972, John Ehrlichman expresses concern that Henry
Kissinger is copying classified documents apparently for use
in his writing when and if he returns to the academic life.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Examination of a Portion of the Records of Richard Helms

On March 13, 1975, I requested that Hank Knoche locate and make
available for the staff's inspection all of the following documents
maintained by Richard Helms or his secretary during the period
between his appointment as DDP and the date of his separation from
the Agency:

Desk calendars

Phone logs

Appointment logs

Diaries

Chronological correspondence files

Tape recordings of meetings and phone conversations as well
as any transcriptions thereof

File memoranda,

On the day I presented my request, Knoche explained that at the tirne

of his departure from the Agency, Helms "tidied up'' his personal

files and that a substantial amount of material may have been destroyed.
Knoche believes that most of the tape recordings of the DCI's phone
conversations and meetings in his office were among the items
destroyed, He added that the Agency has no record of what was
destroyed but that the most productive source of that information would
be Elizabeth C. Dunlevy, who was Helms! secretary at the time, and
who has now retired from the Agency but resides in the Washington
area. Knoche stated that he would make every effort to locate all of
the documents in the above categories which are still within the custody
of the Agency.

 

On March 14, Knoche informed me that he had assembled two full boxes
of My. Helms! records which would be available on Monday in the office
of the Inspector General. On March 18, I obtained the documents from

Scott Breckinridge who expressed doubt that anyone at the Agency
had previously examined them in connection with the Watergate
related investigations or the Commission's investigation.

The documents fall into three basic categories which are as follows:

 

1, Desk calendars (1965 through March 1973). The Inspector
General delivered these to me and described them as ''Helms' desk
calendars", However, before the Senate Select Committee on
Presidential Campaign Activities, Mrs. Dunlevy testified that she
destroyed his calendars around the time of his departure from the
Agency. She further testified that she maintained her own calendar
of his appointments and travel plans and it appears that it is her
calendars for 1965 through March of 1972 that have survived. I
checked these materials only for names and dates of interest to Bill
Schwarzer and myself and suggest that if any of you wish to verify
meetings of importance to your subject areas, you examine these
documents yourselves or make out a list of items which Pete Clapper
could check. The documents remain at our disposal in eight manila
envelopes in one of the safes at our offices at CIA Headquarters (I
have the combination. } . .

 

 

2. Helms' Chronological Correspondence Files (1965 through
March 1973). These files are contained in eleven (1}) hard-cover
file folders, the titles of which are set forth below. I examined
each of these files in its entirety in an effort to locate documents
which might be of interest to our respective groups. Accordingly,
Ido not recommend that’ any of you take the time to make an inde-
pendent examination of these files. In the following pages, listed
below the title of each of the correspondence files, you will find a
brief identification of those documents which appeared to me to have
some relevance to our inquiry (I have probably erred on the side of
over-inclusion), I have also bookmarked the files with white pieces
of paper in an effort to facilitate your finding any documents you
wish to examine.

Helms' memorandum dated 7 December 1965 describing
telephone conversation between Helms and Sullivan re
FBI-CIA relations. In particular, the memorandum deals
with apparent FBI dissatisfaction over CIA activity in con-
nection with project BOURBON,

  

- Helms' memorandum for Bill Moyers dated 9 June 1965
enclosing a document describing the Agency's "efforts to
do something constructive in the student field on behalf of
United States foreign policy.'' The enclosure is a particu-
larly unusual document in which it is difficult to determine
whether Helms is using cryptonyms for the actual names.
if he was using cryptonyms, they were poorly chosen and,
if not, the document appears to describe domestic involve-
ment in the New York area at a time well in advance of the
Ober Project. Among the institutions, organizations and
individuals mentioned in the memorandum are Columbia
University, Adelphi College, the AFL-CIO, the John Birch
Society, and Senators Dodd and Towers.
