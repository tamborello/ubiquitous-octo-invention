- 4, In-October~ 1967 “the ‘DCI ‘turned: Nosenko' s.case over
to~the Office “of Security-for-final resolution, and at the
same- time-the-FBI--began a-review of the information it had
obtained-from-Nosenko. The-results of these two.very. thorough
investigations were.set forth in a memorandum from the Office
of Security dated 1. October.1968 and one from the FBI dated .
20 September 1968, both of which concluded’that Nosenko-was
who -he« claimed. to’ be-and.was*a bona fide defector. ~.Since
that-~time this has-..been and is the position of: CIA.

. 5.. Nosenko-~-was:‘probably: the most valuable source of
counterintelligence-information: that’ the US Government has
’ ever--had;~and~ the: enormous:sscope- and: value of his information
-_ attest..conclusively:to his*bona- fides as a defector. -He —

_ identified.some~2;000-KGB-officers::and 300-Soviets who:.were

 

acting..as KGB* agents: _.He--provided -information ‘on some.-238

. Americans: in whom the KGB had displayed: some interest, including — ° -

- many who had ‘been recruited. For-example,-.one of. his identi-
fitation’s~1led-to.the..trial.and-a-sentence: of -25' ‘years: for US

ArnyxSergeant® ‘Robert:Lee:-Johnson. Nosenko also provided infor- See

mation. on some 200 foreign nationals in 36 countries in whom

. (‘the KGB. had taken an active ‘interest, and the-friendly~foreign |
“governments-with which we shared this information were;able to
neutralize a number of important KGB agents as a result. For

‘example, the British were able on the basis of Nosenko'ts. infor- |.
mation to identify William John Vassall, a high Admiralty.
official, as a KGB agent and.sentence him to 18 years.
