Hm mp- 2243200, py Da and EL

Ce "The VIS-2 Trigger Device, installed athe LIERODE bashhouse to
cover the Consulate entrance, is performing well with little
false triggering."

"See Enclosure A for the VIS-2 area of coverage"

"Z,-22 (LIONION-I) used the K-100 with a 152mm lens for
one day, turning in 10 feet of 16mm film. (See Enclosure
B for the results of this testing.)" .

NOTE: This could have occurred on the Monday after
the eqpt was installed. i.e. 30 Sept. 63.
Thus, the coverage for that day (which can
pe found) only amounts to this one test
picture. It is definitely the K-loo, as
distinguished from the Pulse Camera
because it is 16 mm.

 

"The Robot Star (35mm)...is..now beéng used with the VIS-2
on this project. (See Enclusure C for this coverage) ,

It is possible that this installation, begun in the morning, may have taken
well into the afternoon to couplete because x (1) this ws a new installation
in a new room of the pasehouse. (2) the technicians experienced problems with
the equipment. The ultimate set-up would have been sesheatihen it was complete.
But the Consulate officially closed at 1400 hours, after which there would
have been few, if any, targets (at the gate) for test purposes! It may have

been likely, then, that the insteadlation, when completed, was not tested

against ectlal ( and avaiable) targets until the opening of business, Monday

morning, 30 September. Oswald is not known to have visited the Consulate

DISCUSSION
HSCA Researchers, Dan Hardway and Ed Lopez, reviewed Agency files on
the following dates:
26 May 1978
22 June 1978
5 July 1978
20 July 1978
21 July 1978
This files contain materials cited in the SUMMARY, including sample
‘photos of the Consulate gate using the K-100 and Robot Starr systiids
triggered by the VIS -2, tekenduring-e-—test—peried, These systems are
; : rea ulkant
readily identifiable by nature of the fprints. The K-100 is 16mm format
and is so marked on the reverse side of the print (although misidentified

as Attachement A to HMMA-22433 when it should have been Attachment B).

The Robot Star is 35 mm format. fete

 

exe None of these prints,
which were sent to Headquarters as test results on 7 November 1963, has the
distinctive mark of the Pulse Camera in the lower left corner. The Bulse
Camera recorded a time/date mage in the lower left corner from an internal
Accutron movement. This can be seen in a sample picture sent to Headquarters
