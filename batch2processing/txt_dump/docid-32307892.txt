of value in Une with your request because of the nature of the narcotic
tratie, which offen involves international movement. & ls suggested
that you write directly rather than having your letter of November 7, .
jorwarded because of the possibility that you may ave specific infor«
mation io this Held which would be af value to the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dengerous Drugs in vreaponding to any request that you may make.

Again, i would lke to asewre you of the degire of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation to cooperate fully with you in matters
ol mutual interest. :

Sincerely yours,

NOTE; Commissioner Whitred's letter indicated that his organization is
already in possession of the reports of the hearings before the Permanent a
Subcommittee of Investigations of the Committee on Government Operations
of the United States Senate (McClellan Committee) in which Joseph Valachi
and others gave extensive testimony concerning La Cosa Nostra membership
and activities in the United States. In his letter, Whitrod indicated a prime
interest in narcotics traffic and requested to know the genetic antecedents

of leading (Mafiosi) La Cosa Nostra members to determine possible .
relationships with persons in Australia. FBI investigations have shown no
particular value in gathering such information andjis not available in most
instances, nor set up in such a manner that it can be readily assembled.

Our investigations of La Cosa Nostra have not indicated any liaison with
similar elements in Australia.

Dear Mr. Hoover,

   
  

 
 

As you are aware my organisation is currently
investigating the background and activities of the Mafia
and similar Italian criminal societies in Australis,

 
       
 
  

Ze My officers have been studying the development of
the Society in the U.S.A., and with the aid of the Senate
Papers on Organised Crime and Illicit Traffic in Narcotics,

a picture of the operations in your country has been evolved.

 
       
     
   
 

36 Due te the history of the Seclety's involvement in.
the narcotics traffic between Burope and the U.S.da it seems

likely that the Society is connected with the ever increasing
amount of narcetics reaching Australia. oe

         
    

h, 4s reported in my letter to you dated 7th March 1968
there is recent evidence ef prominent members of the Australian
Society visiting the U.S.A. and Canada, which indicates
collusion in the mutual interests of the Society.

5. The indices of my Crime Intelligence Section contain
at this juncture something in excess of 411,000 Italians of —
Sicilian and Calabrian extraction, and I have no doubt that
there are genetic connections with Italians currently active

  
    
 
  
 
  

in the U.S.A.
