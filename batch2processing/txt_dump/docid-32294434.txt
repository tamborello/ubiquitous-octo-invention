stand for the fact that they were nationalists, ‘BOSCH ~
indicated that the publicity from this would be nost

unfavorable for local authorities and for that reason 7
_ he considered himself more or less untouchable. .

.  BOSCH's associate had asked him what about
CARLOS RIVERO? BOSCH indicated that CARLOS RIVERO,
who has been the leader of the nationalist group in

movement and is apparently still in New York City. ;

In his account of this activity, although he used the tern
mye"; it-was obvious that he was probably not among the a
group who actually participated in this activity. _ BOSCH
indicated that the next major planned activity of the
Cuban Power group was to go to the’ Olympics games in
Mexcio City to make their cause known.

; _He said that in connection with these activities,
it was necessary to raise some $200, 000.00 in order to be
; able to continue the bombings. He said that some Cubans
‘mistakenly thought. the CIA was involved in these activities
and was, perhaps, helping to ‘finance them but this was
not the case. ‘He said it was necessary to raise the funds
through contributions fron the Cuban community. He
of acknowledged he was aware of the fact that it would be
impossible to raise so much money under his nane, ORLANDO

He explained that in past months various
“individuals from several groups locally had been placing
_ bombs in the Miami. area and elsewhere, that these

oo individuals, however, were nothing but gangsters and did

not actually represent the Cuban people. He stated that

“he and his group were the only true. representatives of |

the Cuban people and their activities were directed to
advance the cause of Cuban independence. Among some of
_ the recent activities, the responsibility for which he
7 credited to Cuban Power, were the. following:
The recent bombing of the boat in San Juan, ;
Puerto Rico, harbor was an activity of Cuban Power, and
he was sure that the boat would have sunk if the Coast
Guard had not been alert and prevented it from doing so

~-. by- going to its assistance,

The recent shelling of the Polish vessel, the’

“"polanica", in “Miami had been a Cuban Power activity,

“Indicated that it was necessary to study even harder
