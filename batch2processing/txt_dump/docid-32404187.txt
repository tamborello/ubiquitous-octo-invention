MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

VIA: Director
Center for Study of Intelligence

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: Release of JFK Assassination
Records--Perception Problem

1. This is to advise you of a potential credibility
problem facing the Agency with regard to release of the
President Kennedy assassination records. Paragraph 5
contains a request that you make a determination as soon as
possible to solve this problem.

: 2. As we near the completion of the first review of
the hard copy documents related to the Kennedy assassi-
nation, it has become apparent that a potentially serious
credibility problem looms. This concerns the negative
press, congressional, and public reaction that may well be
caused by the extensive deletions in the documents that CIA
will release to the National Archives and the public.

: 3. The problem arises from the fact that we are still
trying to resolve differences with the Directorate of
Operations reviewers as to what information can be released
in several broad categories. By and large, these categories
do not contain sensitive information, but the accumulative
effect of deleting numerous words and numbers in these
categories wherever they appear may well give the impression
that CIA is not forthcoming and is withholding a lot of
relevant information.

Examples of the categories are:

- cable, dispatch, intelligence report
and file numbers

- cryptonymns no longer in use

- methods that are well known, e.g., _
telephone taps, surveillance (fact of)

- pseudonyms of former employees

MW 53217 Docld:32404187 PagtPMENESTRATLIUE _~— ENPERNAL—UGE-ONDE
SUBJECT: Release of JFK Assassination
Records-~Perception Problem

- source descriptions used on disseminated
reports

- old organization designators, phone and room
numbers

(Attached are examples of documents that appear to have
been excessively sanitized because of deletions of this
type of information.) ,

4. We have been negotiating these points with the DO
reviewers one by one for several months. Given the deadline
of 22 August 1993 for release of the JFK records, there is
not enough time left to continue trying to resolve all the
specific differences.

5. Thus, we appeal to you to make a blanket
determination as soon as possible as to which of the above

categories of information may be released. The Executive
Director is aware of this problem and has asked us what

should be done to solve it.

John F. Pereira
