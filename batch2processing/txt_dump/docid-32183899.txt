: As was noted in paragraph 3, page “2, of Mexico City
letterhead memorandum dated 3/16/64, MORA ‘did.not divulge her ~

_ source of her information regarding the impression of aera

- MEX-19 ve heard MORA make the statement previously that ~
she has corresponded with MARY LOUISE PATTERSON, who has been -
residing in the Soviet Union, it is these ‘informants ' belief
that. PATTERSON is the source in Russia who: advised. that .OSWALD
was well known among American there.

(Cex-18 and MEX-19/ have advised that they hope to
determine from MORA further details regarding her previous
statements about: OSWALD. BZ wes Poe )

From information which [uirx- 18 and MEX- 19] have
learned about MORA becoming a Mexican citizen, it is considered
that if MORA were interviewed, she would be antagonistic
because she is strongly aware her rights, as a Mexican
citizen and (MEX-18 and unk 19penbe advised previously that cu)
if any Mexican police attempt to at any time interview her,
they are going to run into "a tiger." If she were to be .
interviewed by the Mexican police or by any representative
of the United States Government, there are no grounds to
‘pelieve that she would be’ cooperative in any manner:and the.
probability exists that_she would be ast > enough to determine
that she has told only (MEX-18 and MEX-19 information and u]
this would expose these snfonmants~ : to. .
