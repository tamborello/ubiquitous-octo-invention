Dear Mr. Marsden:

On 10/26/92, President George Bush signed "The John F.
Kennedy (JFK) Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992."
This Act requires that Government records related to the
assassination of President Kennedy be sent to the National .
Archives for public release. It was passed because of the
renewed public interest in the release of all JFK records and it
facilitates the release of information normally exempt from
disclosure under Executive Order and/or the Freedom of
Information Act. We have enclosed a copy of the Act for your
review.

The FBI has established a task force to process the JFK
assassination records. The FBI’s goal is to maximize release of
information and we propose to seek postponements (i.e. matters
withheld) only where there is compelling justification for doing
so. In 1978, we processed all of our JFK records and disclosed

«, all of the information which you had provided but withheld your
we “2 company’s name. We believe that we should now disclose that name
ec) a where it occurs in our assassination files. This planned release
MM oe igt|limited to the JFK investigation and the documents defined by
thé 1992 Act and should not affect any future handling of your
2 23 organization’s information concerning other subjects.
