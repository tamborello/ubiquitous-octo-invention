"handouts" which would be owed GUISEPPI for his years of
silence and separation from his family, and for remaining
solid and not telling the police agencies. anything.

cV-344-C stated he was surprised that MEZZATESTA
was as talkative as he had been with him, but he believed |

he had been so as a result of his close friendship with’

his father. He stated there is no doubt in his mind that .
MEZZATESTA would go’ into the complete details of various happenings
including bombings and killings if GUISEPPI would return to

the area. He stated since he would be driving his father around

to meet his friends such as MEZZATESTA and GALLO, he would also
acquire these details which would be of interest "to this Bureau.

He reiterated his father would not furnish information, but he
could obtain the same through him and relay this to the Bureau.

 

: The Cleveland Division, in no way wishes to be
argumentative and overly insistent in its efforts to sécure

the coopération of the INS in getting PINDELLI into the ;
United States on a parole basis; but it ts felt that his ~

re-entry into the United States is the best and most promising

avenue to obtaining the solution to the CAVALLARO murders and

others which occurred previously in the Youngstown area and

which are believed related. The Bureau's patience and con-
sideration in this matter is appreciated. :

CvV-344-c himself pointed out that although there
is no doubt in his mind that through his father he can get
- the true picture of these murders, including CAVALLARO's,
this information would be not likely evidentiary. However,
it is pointed out there have been various..and differing theories
of these murders reported by various informants. If the true
story could be obtained, it would allow this division, to
concentrate on obtaining evidence which might eventually.
lead to the prosecution of those responsible:

In view of the above, it is again requested that ‘the
Bureau, through liaison with INS Headquarters, explore the
possibility that PINDELLI be allowéd to return to the United
States on a temporary or parole basis, as it is felt his
presence will materially aid in the work of this Bureau
as well as the INS facilities.

INS has pointed out that PINDELLI if, in the United
States on a temporary or parole basis, would get out of line
he could be put out of the country immediately and his presence
in the United States would in no way cause. any embarrassment
to any United States agency. : ;

ADDENDUM :
(ZEB) ___

Information has just come to. my attention to the
effect that cv-341-c may himself soon be the victim of a gang
-land killing.

. This information is being set out here as a part of
the over-all consideration the Bureau should give to my
recommendation that effort be made through INS to return
GULSEPPI PINDELLI to this country. ;

On November 25, 1963, cv-554-pc advised that on
that date he had been in Wheeling, West. Virginia, and in ~
touch with PAUL HANKISH who had just been released from the
penitentiary on.a burglary seritence. CV-554-pc said that
BILL LIAS was ‘currently boss in Wheeling and that from what ~
HANKISH told him there may be, in thé. not too- distant. future,
.@ struggle for power in Wheeling between LIAS and HANKISH,

On January 17, 1964, when HANKISH entered his auto-
mobile parked in front of his. residence in Wheeling it bléw
up, apparently as the result of a bomb being placed-in-1t.:
HANKISH was critically injured and both legs. amputated.. Both
of his hands were badly mangled. “HANKISH informed local’ ~
authorities he blamed LIAS for responsibility in the bombing.

" On Mareh 1, 1964, cV-554-Pc visited HANKISH in.
the hospital, and on March 45° 1964, the informant said HANKISH

_is of the definite opinion that LIAS was responsible for the -
bombing. HANKISH told the informant.he had béen in ‘touch with -
individuals in Detroit and New Jersey regarding the bombing, and
they teld him they would obtain satisfaction for him and "take

on a visitor's visa and in order to halt his return to

Italy, he and MOLO arranged a marriage for several hundred

He dollars with a prostitute (ROSE BRYSON) who hung out at the
NAPLES brothers sandwich shop. : :

MEZZATESTA stated ROSE BRYSON had called on him
on April 21, 19604. She has divorced his nephew and had
remarried, and she had stated she had been interviewed by
the INS that day but had "told them nothing" about her
marriake to MADAFFARE to stay his deportation.

CV-344-C told MEZZATESTA-he had heard that his
nephew had been wanted for murder in Italy, and MEZZATESTA
stated someone was confusing his nephew with an ANGELO MACRI
or MACREA. He stated MACRI or MACREA had fled Italy after
murdering three or four police officers. He had arrived in
Canada and later came to Kent, Ohio, where he stayed in his
home for about two months. He later went to New York City
where he was arrested and returned to Italy. . . ;

 

MEZZATESTA stated ANGELO had a brother who was
sought by the Italian’ Police, and they found him asléep
and killed him without giving him a chance. Thereafter, ANGELO
was out to avenge his brother's death, and he sought out each —
officer involved and killed them. He told them they had killed
his brother when his eyes were closed, and he was killing
them with their eyes open and facing him.

cv-344-c stated in talking to MEZZATESTA he was"
able to determine that although he appears to be a harmless
Italian, he is capable and apparently willing to engage ‘in
any action that he is called on to handle, He stated there
was no doubt in-his mind that he would handle a “contract”
if he were asked to do so. He also stated. the possibility
exists that he had been an accomplice of MOLO in several of:
his bombings and arscn cases, but he had given him no details.

CV-344-c stated he told MEZZATESTA that his father
had been turned down for re-entry into the United States; but
he was still working to try to get him back in the country.
MEZZATESTA stated at this point that if GUISEPPI ever came
back, they would call on all their "friends" in thé "organiza-
tion" through the United States to renew friendships and for

Relative to the murder of DOMINIC MOIO, on
September 2, 1963, prime suspect in the death of CHARLES
CAVALLARO, MEZZATESTA advised CV-344-c the following:

. He stated from his own investigation of the
movements of MOIO prior to his death, he believed that
MOIO had been killed in Youngstown and his body was then
taken to Canton, Ohio, where it was recovered. - He gave

-no indication of these responsible, and cv-344-c did not
pursue this.

He stated that DOMINIC MOIO definitely was
responsible for the death of BILLY NAPLES who was blown
up in‘his car, July 1, 1962. He stated that MOTO had been
ordered to set up NAPLES and took an active part in the
murder. He did not elaborate on the details or the others
involved. He did, however, state that MOIO "led BILLY NAPLES
around by his nose" and was on his payroll. He said MOIO
and BILLY NAPLES had many times visited together in his home, ;
and MEZZATESTA personally was very fond of BILLY. He stated :
regardless of his feelings for BILLY when "they" stated he
had to be eliminated, he was powerless to de anything to stop
his murder, regardless of his personal feelings.

 

According to CV-344-c, MEZZATESTA ‘stated that
MOIO had been definitely for hire at all times and got mixed up
with too many of the warring factions. in the Youngstown area
and that was why he was killed.

MEZZATESTA told ov-344- -¢ to stay. away from Yotingstowa
as it was a "bad" town, .He said there was dissension between
various factions, and they were not organized with lines of
authority. He amplified this by stating oné group would.have
control of the prosecutor, another would have the sheriff,
and another grmip would have the police. department. As an example,
he said when . a group would open up the. barbut with the
consent of the prosecutor, the sheriff would interfere and
visa versa and this caused the bloodshed and jealousy.

MEZZATESTA stated his iephew, ANTHONY MADAFFARE,
is no longer residing in his home but has taken a room in the
town of Kent. He said the nephew came to the United States
