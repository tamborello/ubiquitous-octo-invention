Dear Mr. Blakey:

In regard to your 10 August 1978 request for infcemision
v

-concerning one Nestor Castellanos which you indicate was
* withbena by the FBI under the third agency rule, I am pleased.
to provide the following. .

The intelligence report in question is a compendium of
materiel relating to various Cubans who were reported to be
studying in the USSR under scholarships granted by the Cuban
government during the period from 3 March to 6 August 1967.

The report makes no reference to a Nestor Castellanos.

O£ possible relevance is a reference to a Jose Castellanos, -
in which it was indicated cet he (Castellanos) was an Snginmenigg
post graduate from the Cuban Institute of Meteorology whe was
to specialize in hydro-meteorology at the Academy of Sciences and
who was scheduled. to depart (Cuba) on 27 April 1967 aboard a
Soviet ship. The foregoing is the only information contained |
‘in the report relating. to anyone sutnemed Castellanos.

I hope. you will find this information useful to your.

; investigation.
Sincerely,
John G. Kester

Special Assistant To
The Secretary
