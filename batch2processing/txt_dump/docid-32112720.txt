authority, no further investigation in these two areas was undertaken.
However, sufficient domestic aspects in the Castro and Trujillo plans
were found to constitute grounds for undertaking additional investiga-
tion. The President concurred in the approach of the Commission to
interpret its authority so that the Commission would (1) ascertain
whether the charges of assassination plots have a basis in fact and
involve unlawful domestic CIA activities and (2) determine whether

existing safeguards would prevent activities of that nature in the future

regardless of whether they might involve domestic or foreign conspiracy.

The following is a summary of facts pertaining to CIA
participation in assassination plans to assassinate Premier Fidel
Castro and CIA participation in the shipping of arms to persons in
the Dominican Republic who sought to assassinate Generalissimo
Trujillo. The facts have been developed through a review of the
internal investigation of the CIA, examination of documents, and

interviews and testimony. The Executive Director requested complete

access to papers of the National Security Council including papers
of the Forty Committee and its predecessors and papers of any
special groups or special operating groups. Such access was not

granted. Also, ‘time did not permit examination of documents that

might be available in the Eisenhower, Kennedy or Johnson presidential

libraries. Consequently, the investigation is not complete with regard
to the question of who, if anyone outside the CIA, authorized or
directed the planning of any assassination attempts against foreign
leaders. However, with particular reference to the plans directed
against Fidel Castro, the investigation is sufficiently complete to

show that plans were undertaken by the CIA.

B. Participation of CIA Personnel in Plans to Attempt to
Assassinate Fidel Castro :

In the late nineteen-fifties, there was increasing dissatis-
faction with the government of Cuban leader Batista. As Castro's
influence increased, attempts were made to persuade Batista to resign
and turn over the reins of government to a group that was more attuned

to the needs and desires of the Cuban people, particularly in areas of

4 GIWHAS AHL WONX AdODOLOHA

democratic government and social reforms. According to an inter-

view with the former Chief of the CLA Western Hemisphere Division,

an unofficial ambassador from this country approached Batista in

AUWdaIT aaoar

December 1958, asking that he resign and turn over the reins of govern-

ment to new leadership. This request was refused,

Fidel Castro shortly thereafter took over the Cuban govern-
ment. There was great concern on the part of American leadership

about the presence of a government so closely aligned with the Soviet

Union barely ninety miles from American shores.

Bissell asked him to go to the Congo and there murder or arrange
for the murder of Lumumba, and the case officer said that he told
Bissell that he refused to be a party to such an act.* Bissell said
the Agency had nothing whatsoever to do with the death of Lumumba.
3. President Achmed Sukarno

Bissell also testified that there was discussion within
the Agency of the possibility of an attempt on the life of President
Achmed Sukarno of Indonesia which 'progressed as far as the identi-
fication of an asset who it was felt might be recruited for this purpose.
The plan was never reached, was never perfected to the point where
it seemed feasible."' He said the Agency had "absolutely nothing" to
do with the death of Sukarno.

With regard to both plans, he stated that no assassination
plans would have been undertaken without authorization outside the

Agency, and that no such authorization was undertaken for plans against

either Lumumba or Sukarno.

investigation in such areas, which had no domestic aspect which
might bring it within the Commission's jurisdictional mandate under
the President's Order, has not been extensive.
2. Patrice Lumumba
In the course of the first stage of its investigation to
determine its jurisdiction, a preliminary investigation was made of
charges that the CIA was involved in the death of Patrice Lumumba,
who was killed in early 1961. No evidence was found that the CIA
participated in that killing, although there is evidence that prior to
Lumumba's death some CIA personnel and others discussed the
possibility of undertaking a plan to assassinate Lumumba. *
According to Richard Bissell, who was the CIA Deputy
Director of Plans at the time, he was aware of discussion of plans
within the Agency concerning the possible assassination of Patrice
Lumumba and that ''a case officer was directed to look into the
possibilities. He reported back in a matter of weeks and convinced
me that this was probably unfeasible, and probably an undesirable

course of action. According to the case officer, who is now retired,

 

*In an affidavit, C. Douglas Dillon, a member of this Commission,
stated that while he served as ‘Under Secretary of State from June 1959
until early January 1961, he heard no discussion of assassination
attempts against anyone, except discussions which occurred in late
July or early August of 1960 at a meeting at the Pentagon which covered
a great variety of matters in which''...a question regarding the pos-

SUMMARY OF FACTS
INVESTIGATION OF CIA INVOLVEMENT IN PLANS TO
. ASSASSINATE FOREIGN LEADERS
The following is a summary of facts gathered by the Executive

Director of the CIA Commission concerning possible CIA involve-

ment in plans to assassinate foreign leaders.

A. The Scope of the Investigation

The first knowledge that the Commission had concerning
possible involvement of the CIA in assassination plans directed at
foreign leaders was when the CIA informed the Commission staff at
the outset of the Commission's work, in response to an overall staff
request for possible unlawful activities of the CIA, that such plans
existed. The Commission staff was told that there was no evidence
of murders or plots for murder against persons in the United States
carried on by the CIA. However, the Commission staff was told
that there had been discussion of plans for assassination attempts
involving overt acts occurring within the boundaries of this country
with regard to attempts on the life of Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.

1. Determining Jurisdiction

Although there was some question whether or not an

assassination plan aimed at a foreign leader fell technically within

the charter of the Commission, even though overt acts may have

 

*This summary of facts was prepared by David W. Belin, Executive
Director of the CIA Commission, except for the portions on pages 70-

85 pertaining to the Dominican Republic, which was prepared by Marvin
L. Gray, Jr., a Counsel to the Commission. The statement of facts has

not been reviewed by the staff nor has it been reviewed by the Commission.

HW 53244 DocId:32112720 Page 5
taken place in this country, the Commission and its staff determined
that because of the nature and seriousness of the matters involved,

the doubts would be resolved in favor of undertaking an investigation
of the facts. Only after such investigation could the Commission make
an informed decision as to its jurisdiction.

Cn the basis of th e investigation, the evidence shows
that agents of the CIA were involved in planning in this country with
certain citizens and others to seek to assassinate Premier Castro.
The evidence also shows that the CIA was involved in shipping arms
from this country to persons in the Dominican Republic, who sought
to assassinate Generalissimo Trujillo (who himself had been involved
in an attempt to assassinate the President of Venezuela).

‘ No evidence has been found involving any other attempts

‘to assassinate any other foreign leader which had significant overt

activities within the United States. However, the nature of the activity

and the degree of secrecy and compartmentation within the Agency is
such that it is difficult to find any evidence of this kind unless

specific facts are brought to the attention of an investigative body.
With regard to activities outside of the United States, no evidence has
been found of CIA participation in plans to assassinate foreign leaders,

except as described in the next four paragraphs. However, the
