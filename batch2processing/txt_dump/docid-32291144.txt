pigeon in the country." It was speculated that persons of
political influence may attempt. to locate VALACHI on behalf
of the Outfit through contact with the warden or with social
workers. connected withthe federal institution in which ~
VALACHI was enprisoned, It was rumored that the Outfit had
"wrecking crews" out in Chicago and other cities in an effort
to locate relatives of VALACHI. so that pressure could be
placed on him to stop talking. There was a discussion of a”
sereening to be made of Outfit members as a security measure,

On October 7, 1963 MI T-1 supplemented the information given
above with the following matter: Members of the Milwaukee
Outfit are not familiar with the term, "La Cosa Nostra;"

some think it would be more sensible to'use the term, "La
Casa Nostra", meaning, "our house," They feel VALACHI is

not telling everything he knows, that the Senators ina‘ —
televised program of VALACHI's testimony seemed to be putting
words into his mouth, and that VALACHI is rather ignorant and-

stupid and is making up stories. .

For security reasons members are being very cautious not to
reveal confidential information to each other, and the Outfit
has men in the Milwaukee Police Department (PD) who can —
obtain information on anyone giving information to the PD.
If the Outfit suspects anyone of being an ‘informant for the
police or FBI, they will put him under surveillance and if
necessary take him for a ride and question him, If his a
answers are not satisfactory, he probably would not return,

Immediately following VALACHI!s televised account of an ~~
initiation céremony into La. Cosa Nostra, the Milwaukee news=
papers carried a story reporting that the Spe¢ial Assignment ~
Squad of the Milwaukee PD had for some years possessed similar
information, MI T-1 stated he doubted the PD's claim very
much, that to his knowledge the Milwaukée PD has not until”
recently made any inquiry into the membership of the Mafia,”
-He stated the ritual given by VALACHI is similar to one which
was described to him by older members of the Milwaukee Outfit
who came from Sicily, and he does not know whether it is used
ra cate country, He, himself,-was not given any induction
ritual. - ; .

AT MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN

I, EXISTENCE

 

On August: 7 and 13, 1963 MI T-1 advised that the Milwaukee’ ©
Outfit held a meeting on August 6, 1963 at the Rafters Motel,
7228 South 27th Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the purpose of —
which was to discuss articles appearing in the local newspapers
with regard to disclosures made by JOSEPH VALACHI to the FBI
on La Cosa Nostras Approximately fifteen members were present ~
at this meeting, including FRANK PETER BALISTRIERI, VITO. AIELLO,
AUGIE MANIACI, and a man from Chicago who. seemed to have some
authority in the Chicago organization, : ;

At this meeting AUGIE MANIACI and VITO AIELLO were the _only |
individuals who admitted having heard of La Cosa Nostra, The
concensus of opinion of those present was that the term was
just another name for the Mafia; They believed nothing in
the VALACHI situation would affect. the Milwaukee Outfit; A
statement. was made to the effect that "there was no one man
who knows all there is to know about the Outfit and no one
could completely wreck it by giving information,"

Additional opinions also expressed at this meeting were:

The Outfit could kill anyone in Milwaukee without consent of —
the top echelon unless the killing in some way affected a member
of the Commission, The FBI may have fed falsé information to
thé newspapers on VALACHI in order to encourage informants to
supply information, : Publicity of a $100,000 price tag on
VALACHI"s head was ridiculed as "headlines" on the ground that
the Outfit would not publicize such a reward, and. too many
members of the Outflt would be willing to kill VALACHI for no
other reason than the admiration of other members, - One person
stated: "When we get VALACHI, it will shut up every stool
