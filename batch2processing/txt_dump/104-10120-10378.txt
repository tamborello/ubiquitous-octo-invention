Associates firm now ised by Dr. GITTINGER be used for this purpose.
If the A&B assessment were favorable, Security would be requested
to conduct a full investigation of the Subject and he would be
subsequently contacted under alias CIA credentials. At that point,
he would be requested to perform a mission for us and would be
given requirements for same if he agreed to accept such assignment.
