CL is split into two factions.

The faction which is allied with the MIRR is headed
by Jose A. Rajoy, and is composed of the majority
of the action-type members of the original organisation,

The faction which is affiliated with the CF is headed

by Ramon Font Sattell. This faction has a larger nunber

of tho. members of the original organization, but fever

of the action type. A significant nuober of the nesters

of this faction are adherents of Fulgencic Batista ialdivar,

former President of Cuba.

Each faction controls part of the equipment which bolonged
to the original organization,

The MRTN is split into three factions,

ae

The faction which is allied with the SFNE is located
in New York, and is headed by Hiram Gonzalez Herrera.
Although this group has few members, it is the best
organized of the three factions, The main activity of
this group is to collect money for the SFNE,

The faction which is associated with the CF is disorganized,
beset with internal disseusiva, and has few meabers. Since
early summer 1966, two leaders of this factien hare resigned
because of internal problems, first Miguel Isa Fresneda ,*
then hig successor, Luis Moreno Alvarez. Raul Horta is

pow the leader of this faction, which is expected to
maintain its association with the CF,

The third faction, which is ealled the Frank Pais
Revolutionary Movement (MRFP), is actually a phantea
organization. Arturo Gonzalez Gonzalez, the leader,
uses the name of this group In an effort to create the
impression that he nas a position of ‘leadership in the
emigre comunity. This faction is not known to be
connected with any other organization, although at one
time it was associated with the Alinnza Revolucionaria
Democratica (ARD, Democratic Revolutionary Alliance).
