fo

idates that the organization is supporting. The candidates
RICE DANIEL, JARRARD SECREST, TOM REAVLEY and WOODROW W.

. Some of the literature is in Spanish, GARCIA also gave
three records, entitled: Alberto Events SI. FUENTES is
Candidate. GARCIA identified candidat RIAS as a
Bircher. FRIAS is a candidate for U. 3. * nepresentative, 16th
Congressional District. GARCIA, former state organizer for PASO,

| according to the folders he gave LANDIN on PASO, holds no office

in the organization. Although he previously identified himself

as PASO's national organizer. He showed a bill for $217 which

he had ineurred while working as PASO organizer. Labor, he said,
had left him helding the bag (with the bill). Labor had been
paying part of his salary. He is bitterly opposed te Atty. OSCAR
MAUZY, lecal labor attorney. He believed that HAUZY bas been
trying to get rid of him for years, 1954-1955. At one time, when
Mrs. WILLIAM CALLEJO, was active in the forum. The FBI, GILBERT
said, on MAUZY's request, had investigated the forum. Mrs. CALLEJO,
he added, had gone to Washington in connection with the investigation.
He did not elaborate on what Mrs. CALLEJO did in Washington. He
believes labor is trying to stop the Latin-fmericans from organi-
ging. He and JGE LANDIN agreed that in spite of what inadequacies |
dg. G6, GARCIA has he should be supported. The idea was to make the
Latins more politically conscious. He informed JOE that BILLIE 36L
ESTES had donated $150,000 to DON YARBOROUGH for his campaign. The’
check had not been cashed, it had been stepped (stopped payment)

in time. This information, he added, may or may not make the press.

 
  
   

    

Informant determined that after GARCIA left IDA MORENO
contacted JOE LANDIN, She told LANDIN that she used to respect
and admire both GILBERT GARCIA and forum founder, Dr. HECTOR P.
GARCIA, but that after the PASO Convention, she was ashamed of
both of them. Dr. GARCIA had, with his prestige, influenced the
PASO delegates to endorse PRICE DANIEL. The best candidate for
Governor, she said, was BON YARBOROUGH and she was voting for him.
At the convention, she continued, they had been railroaded into
cupporting PRICE DANIEL and that is why the MSO Chapter in Dallas

has been reluctant to work for BANIEL.

 

 

Informant had no additional information.
