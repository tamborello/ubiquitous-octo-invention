On 6/28/61, PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G, FORSYTH, III:

In the past ten days three men were beaten severely in i
New Kensington, Pa. Each of these men wage delinquent ;
in the payment of gambling debts owed to the MANNARINO
organization, and as has been the traditional manner of i
handling such cases, each was attacked by at least two i
of the "strong-arm" collectors, probably SONNY CIANCUTTI and
ANDY MANGINI. ‘The. identities of the beaten men are not known,

any law ‘répforcemehi we agency due to the fear of further Khe
peatings and betause of the prevalent:belief that the ~~
MANNARINO organization "owns” the police.
