weekend of 2/24~-27/67 in connection with his gambling investi-
gation wherein GILBERT LEE BECKLEY, big time gambling figure,
had been arrested in New York. Information furnished to this
office by the Security Department of Southern Bell Telephone &
Telegraph Company reflected that CAHN was interested in the
telephone calls emanating from the Student Union Building at
Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, and had requested a
survey be made of calls emanating from those public pay phones.
It is noted that the New Orleans Office is vigorously investi-
gating this matter under above caption.

On Saturday, 3/4/67, Internal Revenue Service con-
ducted a series of raids and arrested PHILIP L. BOSSEMEYER,
JACK L. LEWIS, HENRY VIGILETTE and JOHN FAVRE. All, with the
exception of FAVRE, were charged with a Federal violation of
not filing a Federal Gaming Stamp, supplemental tax return
showing a change of business address. At the time of the raids,
the IRS Agents seized gambling paraphernalia and an automobile
used for gambling activities, and some $22,000 in cash. LEWIS
and BOSSEMEYER had been arrested on 2/17/67 by IRS and Jefferson
Parish Deputies and charged with having improper gambling
stamps.

NO 1435-C-TE advised that ANTHONY CAROLLA and FRANK ,
GAGLIANO had approached LAMBERT MICHEL, a gambling figure who “
disseminates race results to local bookmakers from the Fair-
grounds Race Track in New Orleans, demanding. that he give
them a financial cut with regard to his operations. Informant
is attempting to develop additional information concerning |
this matter, as well as the identity of other individuals who
might be aware of this. The New Orleans Office is bearing
in mind the distinct possibility that this attempt of CAROLLA
and GAGLIANO might well be a violation of the Hobbs Act.
