On February 15, 1967, SD 1064-C-TE advised that

‘he and JIMMY FRATIANNO and some of the other members (of
Los Angeles La Cosa Nostra (LCN) family) whom he did not
identify, have furnished JOHN ROSSELLI with numerous
complaints regarding FRANK DESIMONE's lack of leadership
in running the family, and that eventually DESIMONE will
be called back to Chicago for an appearance before

representatives of the commission. ROSSELLI will present
the charges in an effort to get DESIMONE deposed as family
boss. Source stated that DESIMONE will try once or twice

successfully to keep from going back to Chicago, but on
about the "third order" from the Chicago boss, he will
have to go back and answer the charges. The informant
said the biggest problem now in the Los Angeles family
besides the lack of leadership, was that all of its
members are becoming old and will die off and no new
blood is being brought in. He felt that there are only
three or four persons now living in Southern California
who could even gualify for membership and that in order
to revitalize the Los Angeles family, they would have to
import young members from the East. .

With regard to JOHN ROSSELLI's arrest by the

sheriff in Las Vegas for failure to register as an ex-con,
source stated this was a bitter blow to ROSSELLI and that 4

the word is out that the sheriff was acting on higher
orders. He indicated that if they find out where those

orders came from, "Someone may get hurt" (The interviewing
Agents received the impression that if anyone in the Jewish
mob in Las Vegas is responsible through political connections
in local government or otherwise for having ROSSELLI rousted,

there willbe retribution by the family).
LA 4412-C-TE°on 12/29/66 furnished information

JAMES ROBERERIANNONE, Ska-DanmyWilson, came in.

LANDOLFI said the FBI asked him if he knew a FILIPPO

SACCO and he had told them, "No". LANDOLFI's wife then
