Reference} EMBTEL 2683..to Department.

Since I read and gave no official cognizance .of Adoula
speech (procured by CAS) I..called on Khiary who surely
drafted it °

Said I heard Adoula was going to make .declaration and .
recalled Khiary's concern that Adoula might: turn: to
Egypt: and Ghana (EMBTEL 2665).

Khiary got out text. of speech and we chewed over pertinent -
._paragraphs. Khiary defended them strenuously, I said 1

was afraid of their effect on-supporters of ‘Adoula in US,
regretted the tone of fait: accompli, and said new line seemed
to mark a.turning from UN concept toward bilateralism.

Khiary minimized all this, said. Adoula had. to say this much

to still his more radical colleagues, denied:any fait .
accompli. We discussed entire US, UN;. Congo interactions

at length .and with energy. [I left. hoping Khiary would at
least ‘change tenses. from past to future and’ mode to conditional.

Khiary still adament,

! I also said consultations now going in NY. between Department,

Gardiner and UNNY ‘and US. seeking for means £8, render its. aid
