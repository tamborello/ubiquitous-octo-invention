MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR
FROM: BETSY PALMER CD
DATE: OCTOBER 5, 1978

SUBJECT: FBI File Review - Movimiento de Recuperacion
Revolucionaria (MRR)

On October 5, 1978, I reviewed three volumes of a five
volume record on the MRR. Volumes 1 and 2 were not

located and they undoubtedly covered the period of 1960-
1963 which are of interest to this Committee. Consequently,
notes were taken only on the volume entitled Miscellaneous
Reference and the others were not pertinent to this in-
vestigation.

Report from New York
Title: Frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD)

The FRD was formed in August and September of 1960 and
was composed of MRR, Rescate, Triple A, MDC, the
Montecristi group and one group with no name. The
head of each group is a member of the Directorate of
the FRD.

Artime heads MRR, the largest group, made up of Catholic
students from universities in Cuba. They are liberal

in their thinking and organized into cells. To date,
they have provided the largest number of recruits for
the FRD.
