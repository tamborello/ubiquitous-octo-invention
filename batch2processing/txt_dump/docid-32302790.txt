vandyke style, long-narrow face, close set eyes. - .

After about two hours, both LASKY and FRANK
exited the Nineth Circle and entered 148 W. loth Sit.,
NYC. One half hour later, LASKY exited alone, carrying a
white envelope, took considerable evasive action in-

.Cluding a stop in phone booth and a return trip to the
- Nineth Circle, then proceeded to the subway and re-
- turned to &9th Street, NYC. .

On 9/19/72, LASKY exited the apartments alone,
carrying a small leather suitcase proceeded via public
transportation to John F. Kennedy airport, took United
Flight Number 5 to Los Angeles. He did not make re-
servations for this flight. The flight departed New
York at 12:00 p.m., due to arrive at 2:20 p.m., LA time,

In addition to the evasive action mentioned
above, it was noted that while at the Nineth Circle,
LASKY took a table next to a window, he faced onedirection
and FRANK faced the other direction, they had an un-

obstructed view of the street in both directions.

_ NY 11893-EG overheard LASKY talking to the door-
man at 205 W. 89th St., on several occasions. Upon
arrival LASKY commented that he would be staying about
three days, that he was a cousin of MC ILWAIN, that he
was from the West Coast and that he was originally from
the New York area. JLASKY was later overheard talking

about his ordeal at the Chinese restaurant, and, upon

departure from the New York area, he told the doorman

“exactly how he intended to travel to JFKIA, and advised

HW 54464

that he was heading back to the West Coast. The signifi-
eance of this is not known but it does not seem consistent
with his otherwise clandestine behavior. ; :
