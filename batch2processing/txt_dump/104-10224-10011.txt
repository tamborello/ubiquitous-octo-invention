Mr. Wigren Is conscientious and serigys about his responsibilt-
tios as research supervisor in SR/CI, and he dtd a fine job in assemb-
ding and presenting SR's contribution to “the work of the Warren
Commission, During the reporting period, pressure of special events
has made’ it impossible for me ‘to give Mr. Wigren the close attention
and guidance needed, so I must’share’ the responsibility for what I

exard as the|

Ihave noted before, Mr. Wigren has boon alrécted wore thin most
by the reorientation of SR/CI; it must bo stressed that he is. being
dudged according to criteria different from those which earlier pre-
‘ vadled for ‘his position; without direct experience or special
interost in operations, he ean hardly bo expected to bring to an
operational ly-oriented research program a full range of experience
‘| and understanding. © Notwithstanding, he has performed well and is a..
“distinct asset. At tho present timo Mr. Wigren and his staff are
ongaged in the important and demanding task of preparing the NIS
‘chapter on Soviet intelligence, and his performance to date has been
marked by interest and compétence ‘and aided by his unusual knowledge
of tho Soviet intelligence services, .
