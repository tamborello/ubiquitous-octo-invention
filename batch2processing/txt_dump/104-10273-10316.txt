affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his servi:ses
to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Gerald Patrick HFMMING
is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#3535 459),
aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In
the late 1950's HENMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Ma rings,
joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafte :
Claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thereafter,
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and ;
Central American activities which he named the International 4
Anti-Conmunist- Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was
named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the major
‘links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,
Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-
nental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
and that members of this unit were connected with CIA. GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.

NOTE: The [Station also included
information the Chief of Station had received

t
from ~ <3). on § dune, CF gad that he
had pcen providing information on ZIMERI to the
Guatemalan government for the past six months or
so. He claimed that two Americans were involved
with ZIMERI, one of them who runs a guard service
in Miami. cy | did not mention names but
described one of the Americans as about six feet
four inches and weighing about 230 pounds.

4. The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends
with five requests for information by President LAUGERUD:

a.- Is ZIMERI still in the United States?

b. In the event ZIMERI is not in the United
_ States legally, deport him to Guatemala.

c. Is ZIMERI recruiting merceraries in the
United States for possible use in
Guatemala? :

@, Does ZIMERI receive any kind of preferen-.
tial treatment by U. S. authorities which
petmit him to carry firearms, as well as
to purchase arms and ammunition for
shipment to Guatemala?

e. Any information on Robert and Gerald
HEMMING?
5. On 19 June 1976 ww ; ta advised
that DDO is referring the entire matter to the FBI and State
Nepartment. ; .

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent
variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HEMMING.

7. From'the name, physical description, activity, and
alleged employment, it is apparent that Gerald Patrick HELMING
is identical with the subject of Office of Security file
429 229, who has been described as six-foot five, 250 pounds,
who is a notorious mercenary and soldier of fortune and who as
of May 1975 was ostensibly employed by a private investigation
Company, TEPCOL Security (Office of Security--no record) in
Miami, Florida.
