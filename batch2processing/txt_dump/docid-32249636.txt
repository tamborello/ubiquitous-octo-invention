9. Memo to Director from SAC, Newark, New Jersey. Re:
GEORGE R. DAMON -- DAMON was subject of an FAG case in
1958 (Bufile 46-32613). Became involved in Cuban
activities in 1958 when he was approached by pro-CASTRO
forces to smuggle arms and men into Cuba. DAMON told
the BATISTA governgment of this approach and demanded
money for exposing the plot. BATISTA forces wanted
DAMON to actually run men and guns into Cuba where
they could be arrested, but DAMON refused to do so,
saying he would be killed.

Since DAMON may be working for CIA, offices receiving
copies of enclosed letterhead are only requested to
check their indices on DAMON and conduct no active
investigation.

Newark office will open a 105 Case File on DAMON and
report any additional information received from NKT-1
or other sources on Long Beach Island, New Jersey.

10. Report from Newark, dated July 12, 1961, NKT-1 advised
GEORGE R. DAMON, a native of Long Beach Island area of
New Jersey, came to Harvey Cedars, Long Beach Island
in May 1961. Had exceptionally large amount of money --
purchased two Lincoln Continentals, two trucks and a
jeep (all new). Had $1,000 cash in refrigerator compartment.
Eighteen months ago, he didn't have a dime.

DAMON said he was a close friend of RAY -- was smuggling
people out of Cuba ~- buying boats for RAY, etc. Had

an appointment in Washington, D. C. on July 12 or 13,
1961 with a MR. PURCELL -- allegedly CIA.

Stated GERRY PATRICK now in Cuba for demolition of
generator stations. Says GERRY PATRICK will receive
$10,000 when his mission completed.

DAMON says arms ship will be blown up in Cuban waters
on July 22 or 23, 1961.

Airtel, dated 7/22/63 to Director from SAC, San Juan.
Informant reported that RAY travelled to Europe via
Washington, D. C. and New York City where he conferred
with exile leaders. Accompanied by EMILIO GUEDES, JURE
leader in San Juan. Travelled to France and Belgium --
solicited support of exiled journalists. In regard to
Belgium trip, he neither confirmed or denied he was
inquiring concerning purchase of arms.

On 1/2/63, CIA informs Director, FBI, it has not control
over JURE but had occassion to contact some of its
officials, particularly MANOLO RAY. CIA has no control
over RAY but realizes he is still an influential force
in exile affairs and therefore finds it necessary to
periodically confer with him concerning developments in
Cuba.

Report of 12/10/62 to Director from SAC New York, re:
DR. ERNESTO ARAGON y GODOY's statement that RAY con-
ferring with officials of Kennedy Administration in
State Department and Pentagon. ARAGON considers RAY

as bad for Cuba as CASTRO. Said he felt that HUBERT
MATOS was imprisioned not because he was anti-communist
but because he protested that he was not included in
CASTRO's inner circle.

 

Memo dated May 25, 1962 to Office of Security, Department
of State from Hoover. Said ROBERTO ROCA ROSILLO,

Puerto Rico, supplied information that WILLIAM BURN,

a British citizen, was an arms dealer in Puerto Rico --
sold 100 guns to DRE in Miami ~- weapons allegedly
delivered in Mexico. BURNS reportedly represents
Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre, a company which
deals in Belgian rifles.

(Note: Army representative in San Juan advised BURN
working under U. S. Army guidance on Cuban penetration).

Memo dated 9/22/61 to Director, FBI from Legal Attache,
Madrid, says contact with Cuban sources of Madrid office
has failed to establish that RAY has come to Spain --
indications that he may have been offered an engineering
job in Spain. A Cuban who arrived in Spain after un-
successful invasion attempt in Cuba, 4/17/61, stated
there was some feeling that RAY may have tipped CASTRO
government to the fact that there was to be an invasion.

reviewed by Patricia Orr. Information gathered is outlined
below.

of "Source A" information and possible operational

by Marymount College in L.S. be extended MANUEL RAY

instructor at Marymount, received a letter written in
Spanish, which claimed RAY was a communist. Letter
signed "AsIrIos" and underneat appeared TEGLALHPILESES,
SARGON and SENAQERIH. On March 19, 1964, GONZALES
again contacts DUELO stating that RAY has other com-
mittments and could not speak at Marymount. DUELO

remarks as pro-Communist.
