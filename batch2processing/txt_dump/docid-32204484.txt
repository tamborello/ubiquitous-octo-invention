PARTY OFFICIALS .TO THE ASSASSINATION
OF PRESIDENT JOUN F, KENNEDY

"Progressive Labor," the official publication of the
Progressive Labor Party, issued a Special Suppicment dated
Novenber 27, 1963, which contained an article which: attempted
to raise doubts as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald actually
killed President Kennedy. The article also attempted to
establish that Oswald possibly had been "framed." The
December, 1963, issue of this same magazine contained an
article which further attempted to establish that Oswald

had been ''framed" and that the Warren Commission did not

make a thorough investigation of the assassination.

The Soviet press, from time to time since the |
assassination of President Kennedy, has carried articles
attacking the conclusions of the Warren Commission.
Immediately following the publication of the Warren Commission

Report on September 24, 1964, the Soviet newspaper "Pravda"
carried an article in its September 28, 1964, edition

“summarizing the findings of the Warren’ Commission. In this

article, the Soviet author stated that the Warren Commission
Report did not dispel. all doubts and suspicions about the.
Nerime of. the century." The article also noted that

"not everything mysterious has become public" and pointed

out that at the beginning of the work of the Warren Commission,
Mr. Warren declared that some facts connected with the

assassination of President Kennedy may not be revealed in

the lifetime of this generation.

In an article in the Soviet newspaper "Yzvestia"
for September 21, 1965, Soviet reporter V. Zorin criticized

the Warren Commission investigation and the conclusions of

the Warren Comuission,. The author also summarized the

allegations of a number of American and European authors
who have written books critical of the Warren Commission
Report and concluded that the assassination in Dallas has

_many riddles to offer and that the mystery remains a mystery.

In September, 1966, the Soviet publication
"New Times" published éxcerpts of book reviews by American
journalist Professor Richard Popkin. Among the. excerpts
pointed out were comments made by professor Popkin concerning
the books "Whitewash" by Harold Weisberg and "Inquest" by
Edward J, Epstein, The Sovict publication points out. that
it is the conclusion of Professor Popkin that. the Kennedy
assassination was the outcome of a carefully daid plot in
which influential quarters were implicated,

conducted by the Warren Commission concerning such assassi-
nation closely follows the Soviet party line. On December 4,
1963, Gus Hall, General Secretary, Communist Party, USA,
informed one of our sources who has furnished reliable infor~
mation in.the past that the assassination followed a pattern

' which clearly indicated it could have been done by no one

other than the “ultraright" and that Hall feels that Oswald
was killed by the “ultraright" in order to prevent him from
talking. Hall indicated to our source that he planned to

contact Soviet officials to determine if they planned to
interview Marina Oswald and, if so, he planned to ask the
' Soviets to question Marina whether Lee Harvey Oswald had ©

any connections with the "ultraright," had any relations
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or had any _

. relations or contacts with Jack Ruby.

Hall also told our source that he felt the Soviets

_are too lax in allowing "all kinds of persons to go to
Moscow." Hall expressed his opinion that at_the time Oswald

went to Moscow, he was operating for the Federal Bureau of

“Investigation. Hall further stated that Oswald "could have
* been a nut, too."

The position of the Communist Party, USA, toward
the Warren Commission Report was clearly set forth in the

“October, 11, 1964, issue of "The Worker," an East Coast

communist newspaper. In an article captioned “Warren Report
Brushes Off Ultra-Rightist Conspiracy," it was stated that
the Warren Report gives comparatively very little space to.

“the material that came before it indicating that a

"Right-wing conspiracy" was in the making and that Oswald
was a "Left-painted" undercover instrument of such forces
or of a Government agency. The article further, stated that
even the limited material which the Warren Commission has
put into the record on the Rightist conspiracy that was in
progress is an inportant contribution and provides a basis
for further investigation.

No information has been developed indicating any
of the so-called comnunist "splinter groups} such as the
Progressive Labor Party, Socialist Workers Party or the
Workers World Party, have planned or instituted any con-
certed cffort or drive to discredit or attack the Warren
Commission. Official publications of these organizations
have from time to time contained isolated articles which
have been critical of the Warren Commission, For example,

Our source added that Ivanov also emphasized that ‘
it was of extreme importance to the Soviet Government to '
determine precisely what kind of a man the new President : :
Lyndon Johnson would be. Ivanov said that President Johnson :

-was practically an unknown to the Soviet Government and, i
accordingly, the KGB had issued instructions to all of its
agents to immediately obtain all data available concerning ©
the incumbent President. Ivanov said that it would be
necessary for KGB personnel to gather and correlate all
information concerning President Johnson, including his
background, his’ past working experience and record in
Congress, his present attitude toward the Soviet Union, and
particularly all information which might have bearing upon
the future foreign policy line he would follow. .

On September 16, 1965,.this same source reported
that the KGB ‘Residency in "New York City received instructions
- approximately September 16, 1965, from KGB headquarters in
_ Moscow to develop all possible information concerning ;
.. President Lyndon B, Johnson's character, background, personal
'. friends, family, and from which quarters he derives his
support in his position as President of the United States.
Our source added that in the instructions from Moscow, it
was indicated that "now" the KGB was in possession of data
purporting to indicate President Johnson was responsible for
the assassination of the late President John F,. Kennedy.
KGB headquarters indicated that in view of this information,
it was necessary for the Soviet Government to know the
existing personal relationship between President Johnson
and the Kennedy family, particularly that between President
Johnson and Robert and "Ted" Kennedy.

; On March 3, 1964, Yuri I. Nosenko, Soviet defector
whose bona fides has not been established, advised that he
was handling Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB)
investigations of tourists from the United States at the-
time Lee Harvey Oswald visited Russia in 1959, and conse-
quently was fully cognizant of the Lee Harvey Oswald case,

According to Nosenko, Oswald came to the attention
of the KGB when he expressed a wish to defect to the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics shortly after his arrival in
Russin, However, the KGB, after inquiry, decided he was :
mentally unstable and informed him he had to return to the lg
United States upon completion of his visit. Thereafter, . r
when Oswald missed a sight-seeing tour he was to take, his
hotel] room was forced open and he was found with one of his
wrists badly cut, ;

Nosenko added that Oswald was hospitalized and

thereafter was allowed to remain in Russia, apparently
through the efforts of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
the Red Cross. Oswald again came to the attention of the

‘ KGB when he attempted to re-enter the Soviet Union by placing
a request with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, after his return
to the United States. Nosenko stated that the KGB recommended
against allowing Oswald to re-enter the Soviet Union. Accord~
ing to Nosenko, Oswald's case was a routine one in which the
KGB had no interest until he assassinated President Kennedy. |
He was not approached or recruited for espionage by the KGB |
nor was his wife, Marina. Nosenko said Marina was regarded
as a woman who possessed little intelligence and he added
that she had once been a member of the Communist Party but
had been dropped for failure over a long period of time to

-; pay her dues. : :

 

|
“It was the opinion of Nosenko that President |

“Kennedy was held in high esteem by the Soviet Government... oy |
and that President Kennedy had been evaluated by the Soviet °°
Government as a person interested in maintaining peace.
According to Nosenko, following the assassination, Soviet
guards were removed from around the American Embassy in i
Moscow and the Soviet people were permitted without inter~ |
ference to visit the American Embassy to express their
condolences. Nosenko.added that the KGB provided approxi-
mately 20 men who spoke the English language to handle duties i
in the immediate vicinity of the American Embassy in Moscow |
-at that time to insure that no disrespect was shown. during |
this period. oO -

 

Following the assassination of President Kennedy,
Anatoli Dobrynin, Soviet Ambassador to the United States,
turned over to the Secretary of State a file alleged to be
the complete consular file on Lee H. and Marina Oswald
maintained in the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D, C,
Subsequently, the Soviet Government made available to the
United States Government the hospitalization record of

. Lee Harvey Oswald during his hospitalization in the
Soviet Union. This record corroborated data previously
received indicating Oswald had attempted to commit suicide
in the Soviet. Union. .

REACTION ‘OF SOVIET AND
COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIALS
TO THE ASSASSINATION OF

“ PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY

A source who has furnished reliable information
in the past and who was in Russia on the date of the
assassination of the late President’ John F, Kennedy advised
on December 4, 1963, that the news of the assassination of
President Kennedy was flashed to the Soviet people almost
immediately after its occurrence. It was greeted by great
shock and consternation and church bells were tolled in the

_memory of President Kennedy.

According to our source, officials of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union believed there was some well-
organized conspiracy on the part of the "ultraright" in the
United States to effect a "coup." They seemed convinced that
the assessination was not the deed of one man, but that it
arose out of a carefully planned campaign’ in which several

people played a part. They felt that thosé elements interested

in utilizing the assassination and playing on anticommunist
sentiments in the United States would then utilize this act

“to stop negotiations with the Soviet Union, attack Cuba and

thereafter spread the war, .As a result of these feelings,
the Soviet Union immediately went into a state of national
alert, . '

Our source further stated that Soviet officials
were ‘fearful that without leadership, some irresponsible
general in the United States might launch a missile at the
Soviet Union. It was the further Opinion of the Soviet
officials that only maniacs would think that the "left"
forces in the United States, as represented by the Communist
Party, USA, would assassinate President Kennedy, especially
in view of the abuse the Communist Party, USA, has taken
from the "ultraleft"” as a result of its support of the
peaceful coexistence and disarmament policies of the Kennedy
administration, .

According to our source, Soviet officials claimed
that Lee Harvey Oswald had no connection whatsoever with
the Soviet Union. They described him as a neurotic maniac
who was disloyal to his own country and everything. else.
They noted that Oswald never.belonged to any organization
in the Soviet Union and was never given Soviet citizenship. .
A second source who has furnished reliable infor-

mation in the past advised on November 27,.1963, that
Nikolai T. Fedorenko, the Permanent Representative to the
Soviet Mission to the United Nations, held a brief meeting
with all diplomatic personnel employed at the Soviet Mission
on November. 23, 1963. During this meeting, Fedorenko related
for the benefit of all present the news of the assassination)

of President John F. Kennedy and stated that Kennedy's death
was very much regretted by the Soviet Union and had caused
considerable shock in Soviet Government circles, Fedorenko

_ Stated that the Soviet Union would have preferred to have
had President Kennedy at the helm of the American Government.
He added that President Kennedy had, to some degree, a

‘mutual understanding with the Soviet Union, and had tried
seriously to improve relations between the United States
and Russia. Fedorenko also added that little or nothing
was known by the Soviet Government concerning President L:.idon
Johuson and, as a result, the Soviet Government did not know
what policies President Johnson would follow-in the future
regarding the Soviet Union.

: According to our source, Colonel Boris Ivanov,
Chief of the Soviet Committee for’ State Security (KGB) .
Residency in New York City, held a meeting of KGB personnel
on the morning of November 25, 1963. Ivanov informed those
prese; ¢ that President Kennedy! s death had posed a problem
for the KGB and stated that it was necessary for all KGB
employees to lend their efforts to solving the problem,

, According to our source, Ivanov stated that it was
, . his personal feeling that the assassination of President -
Kennedy had been planned by an organized group rather than
being the act of one individual assassin. . Ivanov stated
that it was therefore necessary that the KGB ascertain with
the greatest possible speed the true story surrounding
President Kennedy's assassination. Ivanov stated that the ;
KGB was interested in knowing all the factors and all of le
the possible groups which might have worked behind the scenes ry
to organize and plan this assassination, ct
