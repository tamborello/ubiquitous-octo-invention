presence to the West German authorities, he could build up

his reputation as a counterintelligence specialist. While
there is debate about the value of the assets the Soviets

made available, there appears to be enough substance to this
theory for it to have had a strong impact within the Agency,
particularly upon those persons who were members of the former
Eastern European (EE) Division of the Plans Directorate.

In the course of time, the continuing record of KGB
success in penetrating Western governments made it the more
feared of the two principal Soviet intelligence services.
Although we had had our successes also in penetrating the
Soviets, they were primarily through GRU defectors-in-place
such as Popov and Penkovskiy. The defection of Anatoliy
Golitsyn on 15 December 1961 was thus a major event.

Once again, it is not necessary here to go into details
regarding Golitsyn, because this case has been covered exten-

sively in a recent study. However, two points are worth
noting:

1. First, Golitsyn was diagnosed early in

1962 as a “paranoid personality." Although account
was taken of this psychological problem, it was

tinuity of the debriefing process rather than as
a factor reflecting on the validity of the purported :
intelligence he gave us. It was apparently felt i
that, if we could maintain his stability, we could .
depend not only upon the objectively verifiable
facts he gave us but also upon his often very
theoretical generalizations.

2. Secondly, Golitsyn presented us right from
the beginning, continually elaborated throughout
the years, a complicated rationale for believing :
that the KGB was successfully pursuing a mammoth t
program of “disinformation” to the detriment of the i

United States and its Western allies. This ratio-
nale is covered in more detail in Chapter VI of
this report.

It is against this background that we view the approach
to CIA by Nosenko and his subsequent handling. In doing so,
we shall for ease of reference from time to time allude to
the thesis regarding KGB operations and intentions--claborated
by Golitsyn and others--as the "Monster Plot." In fairness,
it must be allowed that this term was in common usage not
by the thesis' proponents but rather by its detractors; yet
no other name serves so aptly to capsulize what the theorizers
envisaged as a major threat to United States’ security. If
the term carries with it emotive connotations, the latter
were certainly shared by both sides to the controversy; and

_ this fact alone is enough to justify including “Monster Plot"

in the lexicon of this study.

A third organizational participant in the Nosenko case
was the Office of Security. This office had overlapping
jurisdiction with CI Staff and, to a lesser extent, SB Division
in any matter that involved a suspected Soviet or Soviet Bloc
penetration of the Agency. While not usually a problem, the
overlapping jurisdiction was considerable in both the
Golitsyn and Nosenko cases because so much of the activity
in connection with both operations revolved around allegations
that the Soviets had penetrated the Agency at a high level.

Although allegations that the Soviets had recruited
Agency staff employees did not first originate with Golitsyn,
it was he who lent special force to them by spelling out a
complicated theory of Soviet intentions and modus operandi.
He thus provided a detailed conceptual framework within which
to develop a hypothesis towards which some members of the
Agency were already predisposed. Golitsyn thus became the
ideologue's ideologue.

Prior to Golitsyn's defection, the Agency as a whole had
been hard hit by its dealings with high-level Soviet penetra-
tions of Western governments. There is no need to go into
detail on them, since they have been well documented else-
where, but they included British representatives such as
Kim Philby and George Blake. Another important penetration
was Heinz Felfe, who rose to be Deputy Chief of Soviet

CHAPTER I
Organizational Background: CIA's Handlin
Of Soviet Positive Intelligence and CI Natters

The history of the Nosenko case can only be comprehended
within the framework of the organization and day-to-day func-
tioning of the Central Intelligence Agency as a whole. In
fact, opinions regarding the handling of the Nosenko case may
differ substantially according to individual's differing
views regarding internal Agency organization and functioning.
This being the case, it is useful at the outset to make
explicit our understanding of how the Agency actually func-
tioned in the relevant period, the 1960s, as distinct from
how it might theoretically have functioned according to
Agency organizational charts and regulations.

The two instrumentalities for the conduct of day-to-day
operations in the Soviet field were the Soviet Bloc Division
(known successively by this and several other names*) and
the Counterintelligence Staff. In the nature and interrela-
tionship of these two organizations we find the key to much
of what was to happen in the Nosenko case,

 

 

 

 

“CI Staff" was actually a misnomer, because the organi-
zation carrying this name did not even concern itself to any
appreciable extent with the counterintelligence function of
the Agency on a worldwide basis. Rather, it concentrated on

j Bloc countries. :

 

 

 

pe

*This area component during the period of this report was
known as Soviet Russia Division (1952-1966) and, Soviet Bloc
Division (1966-1974). The two names are often used inter-
changeably.

Introduction

On S June 1962 Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko, a Soviet official
temporarily assigned to Geneva, contacted an American Foreign
Service Officer in a move that was eventually to lead to
Nosenko's defection. This act was the first in a chain of
events that is unequaled in complexity by any other Soviet
operation handled by the Central Intelligence Agency since
its establishment. Because the case still has important
implications for the overall Soviet intelligence effort of
the United States, and because it raises many basic questions
about the techniques of handling Soviet agents and defectors,
a reinvestigation of the case was commissioned by the Agency
in June 1976: The results are embodied in this report and
its annexes.

Although United States officials of many agencies, up
to and including a president of the United States, were briefed
on the case and either played some role in making decisions
concerning it or actively participated in running the opera-
tion, it does not now appear that, between 1962 and 1976, any
Single individual has ever been fully informed as to all its
aspects. The complexity of this investigation therefore
stems in large measure from the fact that the case -has pro-
ceeded along at least two, and often more, compartmented
tracks. Thus, the effort to get a total picture of what
transpired has involved an unusual amount of research in the
files of various components of the Agency, plus personal in-
terviews with a large number of present and former Agency
employees.

The actions taken in regard to Nosenko were not the
result of decisions made by a unitary Agency acting as a
corporate entity; rather, in this case more than in most,
decisions were made by a number of senior individuals on the
basis of their own strongly-held views, which sometimes con-
flicted with the equally strongly-held opinions of other
senior colleagues. Thus, this report must, if it is to be
comprehensible, attempt to depict the decision-making process
in all its complexity by referring when necessary to the
individual participants. .
