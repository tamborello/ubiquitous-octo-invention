asked Johnson to compare the letter of Pokey's ‘with:
Oswald's to see if they didn't have a lot:>in Common.
Palmer stated that he thought the statement: by’ the -
Methodist Minister Covered the situation very good
when he stated that the fact that the Murdar of Bi11
Moore, M Edgar Evers and others in the. south going
by without punishment had set the stage for the ©
Assassination of Pres. Kennedy. Everyone weadily
agreed, .

Arnold Johnson further stated that no real Marxist
Could do such a thing. There is not Much doubt that
since the Soviet Union had expelled him by not
giving him a Citizenship im the Soviet Union because
they thought him to be an Agent of Fascism. Genne
Meanwhile was Chomping at the. bit trying to get her
story told about the N.A.A.C,.P, and CORE,

i

She finally got her Chance to unload.

She stated that about the time of the Civil Rigtt's
March on Washington a few days befoxe she had béen
working with CORE and NAACP. the reporter from the
Wheeling paper Intelligencer had Called and wanted
to talk about her. She gave him answers. on the |
phone and finally hung up on him. from the. time
this phone conversation was completed She had been.
quoted in the newspaper and exposed as a Communist
party Member, which brought-about her expelsion from
thé. N.A.A.C.P., but simce has been restored to
Membership. Then lately a Man (Negro) by name of Johnson
head of the local CORE group was indicted for robbing a
bus driver in Steubenville, Ohio. Genne had got in
touch with R. Gorby as she thought Johnson was being
framed. Gorby found out and told her at this Meeting
that he had did the robbing and was Not being framed.
The best thing to do stated Gorby was to give him
help but do not put:CORE.amd the NAACP out. om a limb
by doing it. ; .
