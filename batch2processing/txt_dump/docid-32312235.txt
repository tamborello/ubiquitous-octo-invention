for furnishing misle ng information to (Czechoslovaka
Intelligence Servic: rough NY|[83: . This information
would be about the US space program’and it was expected
the Guecnifyyouia pass the information on to the Soviets.
The Bureau~advised the matter would be discussed with
officers of appropriate agencies at the Seat of

PUBLISHING OF POLISH INTELLIGENCE
AGENT'S PURCHASES IN US ai
. ¥ .

By letter dated 10/1/64, the NYO outlined a
plan for reducing the amount of money available to
Polish intelligence personnel in the hopes it would
increase our changes of bringing about a defection.

It has been their practice to buy a great many items
which they take back to Poland and sell at a big

profit on the black market. Arrangements could be

made to publish examples of this sort of thing in the
emigre press. This would no doubt come to the attention
of Polish offictals who could be expected to put a stop
to trading of this sort. This would eliminate what has
been an important source of funds for Polish intelligence
personnel at a time when their salaries have been reduced.

2. PENDING COUNTERINTELLIGENCE
ACTION

BRONX CP ORGANIZATION

The CP organization in the Bronx has grown
increasingly stagnent through a combination of various
circumstances. A study is being made of the factors
that brought on this stagnation with the thought
that we may be able to devigg a letter or a series
of letters to the individual CP leaders in the Bronx
pointing out various mistakes of the leadership. The
letters would contain legitimate criticism and some
worthwhile suggestions, but would be designed to
eause friction and factionalism.

FORMATION OF FICTITIOUS COMMUNIST ORGANIZATIONS

Consideration was being given to the formation of
of a fictitious chapter of the W.E,B, Du Bois Clubs’ of America
in an area where there is now little or no CP activity.
Consideration was also being given to the formation¥or CP
Club. in Memphis or Oklahoma City.

AMERICAN COMMITTEE FOR A TRUE
MARXIST-LENINIST COMMUNIST PARTY (ACTMLCP)

NYO has paid the rent thru March, 1965 on
PO. Box 765fat Grand Central Station which is held in the
name of the ACTMLCP. The NYO has not recommended any
additional use of this_fictitious organization because it
tends to parallel the [Ad Hoc Operatigilen, sone respects. |
The ACTMLEP was set up to alert peopl who might not otherwise
know) as to the Communist nature of the W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs.
It is believed that when the ACTMLCP is used again, it could
be for this same general purpose. The NYO will remain alert
to the possibility of exposing other Communist controlled
organizations, which wishes to conceal their Communist control,
by asking the people they are trying to influence to resist
the "Revisionist" line of the Communist controlled organization

MAY DAY RALLY, 1965

The NYO sent a number of post cards to Security
Index subjects at their place of employment advising them of
a NCASF rally held on 11/12/64. The tangible results of
this operation ame set out below. The NYO intends to

secure Bureau authority fofmaking similar mailings in connection

with the next May Day celebration.
