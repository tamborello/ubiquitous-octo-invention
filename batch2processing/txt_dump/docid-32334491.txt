MEMO SAC (1341090) 9/22/65

RE: VALJEAN MATTHEW HALEY
PSI ~ MINUTEMEN

On 9/22/65 PSL said he tas Pinally successful, after
several unsuccessful attcmots, in contacting LAWRENCE L. ALLEN
Allen Industries, 2219 Belvedere Road, West Palm Beach, Fla.. fe is
noted ALLEN was identified by more than one source as a member of
MIVOTEMEN, PST said he contacted ALLEN on the pretext that there had
been a complaint about someone's shooting through the window of a
business establishment and noting that ALLEN had complained of a
similar incident in the past, wondered if ALLEN could help hin.

PSI said he talked with ALLEY for quite soe time and ALLEW gave no
indication of recognition of PSI as a Minuteman menber,

. PSI said he has received no comnunicaticn from Minutemen
since the last ones he turned in to writer.

It is noted others in the area have received Minutenen
literature since that tine 50 it would appear Minutemen have decided
they cannot trust PST since he is a Deputy Sheriff. Contact will be
maintaaned with PSI for a reasonable length of time to see if he is
contacted in any way by Minutenen and if he is not, he willbe
discontinued as a PSI.
