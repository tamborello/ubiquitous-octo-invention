G0: Philadelphia

Re your airtel 10-26-62.

Bureau guthority is granted to conduct a survey and, if
feasible, to instali a misur at the Tri-City Textile Company,
@ld Forge, Pennsylvania, and to secure the necessary leased line
in connection with this installation.

‘fhis matter should be closely followed to insure that
‘the source is developed with the least possible delay consistent
with security. Submit FD 143 within 30 days after installation. ?

NOTE: Philadelphia was previously authorized to install this misur,
however, their request was resubmitted in view of the increased
estimate in cost of the leased line from $1 to $3 per mile each
month. Philadelphia now advises that the leased line cost will be
approximately $350 to $400 a month. This method of monitoring the
source at (the Philadelphia technical plant will be considerably
«, T¢ss expensive since the operation of a separate plant would require .
© transferring an employee to the resident agency plus the expense of
& iéfising separate space. This source will be monitored at the
‘Bteggnical plant in conjunction with other misurs,} thus reducing the
alary expense to a fraction of one employee. Bufalino is one of
$he 4O target subjects and a principal racket figure in the Eastern
Penrgy lvania area. He is closely associated with leading hoodlums
Oy 3% the garment industry in New, York,City,, Bufalino utilizes the
