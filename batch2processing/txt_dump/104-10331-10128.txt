Subject: Anne Goodpasture Depasition

This memorandum confirms yesterday's discussion regarding the arrangements that we
have made in preparation tor the Goodpasture deposition. The deposition will take -
place in Dallas, Texas on December 15 at the U.S. Attomeys office. Jeremy Gunn will
take the deposition, with the assistance of Michelle Seguin. We have secured a court
reporter from the firm of Dickman, Davenport, & Langtord located in Dallas and have
confirmed the court reporter's clearance level of Secret with the Department of Justice.
For your convenience, we have attached a copy of the clearance certification. As
discussed yesterday, we believe that this level of clearance will be sutticient for this
particular depostion. We also have taken all necessary security precautions for
transport of the classified material. It you have any questions, please feel free to contact
us.
