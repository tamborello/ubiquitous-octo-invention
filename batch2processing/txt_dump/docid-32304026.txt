. MM T-4 said that on December.27, 1956, it was
_ ‘keported that SANCHEZ was working with RICARDO MADAN, .and
_they were responsible for shipping a large quantity of
‘arms into Cuba by use of the Air Express. Service.

MM -T-4 said that:-on April 27, 1957,.a report was
~-received that SANCHEZ and. MADAN had been sentenced to death
by certain elements. of the "PRIO cause", who accused ‘them. of
‘not having distributed all of the ‘ammunition for the
~ attack on the Presidential Palace in Havana on March 13,

1957. MM T-4 said that this report of April 27,1957,
indicated that SANCHEZ had accused MADAN of being the
- only ‘one responsible for the failure of the attack: on
“the Palace.

. On October 11, 1957, MM 1-5; another government
agency. which conducts ‘personnel or: intelligence, investi-.
gations, stated that RICARDO MADAN RI VAS, presently a
-.vegident of Miami Springs, Florida (@s of October 11,
_1957), had admitted to the ‘Immigration, and- Naturalization
- Service Agents in Miami that he had been active in.
revolutionary activities, but he. denied. that he had
" purchased or furnished any tickets to Cubans who .went

to the Dominican Republic for military Reining: fre) Cc)

MADAN, who liveg on Lenape Street in Miami ‘Springs, ~
Florida, has. an office at the Eagle Shipping\Company,

. MM T-2 advised that he knows MADAN personally
_ and does not like him, but believes that during the period.
of the mid-1950's MADAN was working for money.

MM T-2 stated that he would describe MADAN as
an exporter of arms and textiles in 1957. .

MM T-2 said that im 1957 the largest cache of :
dynamite seized during. that general period by the Cuban
‘Government was reportedly MADAN's own, at least he was
held to be responsible for its being in Cuba.

MM T-2 stated that MADAN now gets marble from
Cuba and Mexico, and that MM T-2 has heard that MADAN
has purchased machinery for making terrazzo flooring from
Italy, and that he still owes money for such machinery.

On February 18, 1960, the files of the

Immigration and Naturalization Service reflect that
MADAN's number is Al0-178-023. ‘Their records reflect
that his passport number was 03987,- issued by the Republic
of Cuba on March 12, 1953, and that it had an expiration
date of March 11, 1958. His date and place of birth were
listed as Havana, Cuba, December 25, 1912, and his address,
at that time, was 4th Avenue between 48th ani 50th Streets,
Miramar, Havana, and his Umited States address was 1225
Southwest 22nd Terrace. His places of residence were
listed as from birth to 1953, Havana, Cuba, and from
1953 to 1955, the time of the filing of the application ;
for temporary stay in the United States, as in Miami most '
‘of the time. Reports from the Ministry of Justice of the
Republic of Cuba and from the municipal jail in Havana,

4 both dated December 29, 1954, reflect that there was
no record which would reflect on the character or the
morality of MADAN as of those dates . A check of the Miami
Police Department record of January 11, 1955, showed no

; record of MADAN, according to information contained

in the above mentioned Immigration and Naturalization
Service file. ;

PRIO through RICARDO MADAN, who, at that time, was in the

‘airline express business in Miami. MADAN took VAZQUEZ

to see PRIO. -VAZQUEZ transported guns from Key West by
way of a plane which he flew for "Q" Airlines from Key
West to Camp Columbia in Cuba, and the weapons were taken
to his home, and men employed by MADAN picked up the
material for delivery to the PRIO organization. At

that time AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO was in charge of

the PRIO group. in Cuba. The storage of the guns in

the Key West area was arranged for by one CARLOS MEDINA,

a mechanic at "Q" Airways in Key West who also helped load
the plane. . ;

ne

On June 30, 1958, MARIA SOLIDAD VAZQUEZ, wife

, of DANIEL VAZQUEZ, above mentioned, furnished to Agent

1953, and one of. those so listed was RICARDO MADAN.

: Mrs. VAZQUEZ also furnished a list which was. .
given to her by PRIO.in 1953 which contained the names oON
of people on whom. PRIO felt he could rely. The name ‘
RICARDO MADAN appeared on this ‘list.

“Again it should be noted that current

“instructions are that information furnished by Mr. and

Mrs. VAZQUEZ is not to be disseminated outside the Bureau
without prior Bureau authority.

As set forth in Miami letter to the Bureau

“dated February 25, 1960, MADAN has-been in periodic,

regular contact with the Miami. Office on a voluntary
basis, and has furnished information which, where

“subject to verification, was found , to be correct.
