Pf company has been defunct for a long time, TE

other contacts which resulted in developing clients. For
example, in Baltimore he acquired the account, of the Cee Gee
Mu's Company, which was organized by JOSEPH¥GIGLIOTTI and
:ourShCottE. When the Filben Company ran into'financial
~““diffreurtias, it resulted in an investigation by the Internal
Revenue Service, and a great deal of newspaper publicity was
given to all arities in the operation of this
business, had been placed in a compromising
position by officials of this company and realized at that
time that he had been taken advantage of by MARGIOTTI and his
associates, He also realized that these men were engaging in
questionable activities and felt that if he continued his
association with them it could jeopardize his standing as an
accountant. :

In about 1950, he decided *o discontinue his relationship

with MARGIOTTI and his associates, He wrote registered letters
to MARGIOTTI, GENOVESE, RIPEPE and others, advising them he
would no longer handle their accounting, At that time he would
have discontinued his associetion with LAROCCA, except for the
fact that he was then doing accounting for LAROCCA in connection
with some litigation involving most of LANMCCA's financial .
interests, LAROCCA asked him to continue doing his accounting
work at least until litigation was completed. Actually,

this situation has continued and LAROCCA has become further
indebted to him, so that at present, LAROCCA owes him a
considerable amount of money for accounting fees,

In the vast several years, LAROCCA has entertained Mr,

at his residence for dinner and to meet his family.
Therefore, in_the latter part of 1957, when visiting with
LAROCGCA, Mr, invited him to attend the wedding of
his son, whi be held at Philadelphia. In February,
1958. the wedding was held and LAFOCCA appeared accompanied
by ANTHONY RIPEPI, At this time, LAROCCA stated that his
wife was i11 and could not accompany him. a
that time did not know that LAFOCCA was wanté y @ Govern-
ment or that there was any Federal Grand Jury Proceeding in
which LAROCCA was involved,

He recalled that when he last visited with LAROCCA prior

to the wedding, LAROCCA was having some trouble with his
throat, but at the wedding he did not notice any trouble in
this regard.
