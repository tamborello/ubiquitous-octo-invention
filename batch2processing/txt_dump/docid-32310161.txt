Davidson, who is registered as an agent of Séveral 9
foreign principals, has advised Inspector R, T. Nischwitz tha

 

; he has been approached to represent a Dominican Republic political UN
| party being formed and would be willing to take the assignment an
if it would be of any benefit to the Bureau. ane
oO
Davidson in the past has described himself as a "five pit
y percenter, out to make a fast buck," and our files indicate he is ‘% *
va rather unsavory person. He frequently volunteers information to “S y
Q YW the Bureau, particularly when it will serve his own purposes, “ \
yw

Inspector Nischwitz advised today (5/26/69) that
Davidson contacted him yesterday to.report that Luis Dominguez,
a former Dominican Air Force officer who is now married to
Angelita Trujillo, daughter of the late Dominican dictator Rafael
-Trujillo, and one Frank Evora, Dominican newsman, plan to form a
\new political party with Ramfis Trujillo, Rafael Trujillo's son,
as its head. The party will be registered in New York and will
endeavor to bring about the election of Ramfis as President of the
Dominican Republic in 1974. Meanwhile, it will passively support
Joaquin Balaguer for re-election to the Presidency in 1970.
Davidson said Dominguez and Evora asked him to represent them in
the U. S. He told them he wanted to think about this. Davidson
said he is a good friend of Balaguer's and is not too interested
in taking the job but would do so if the Bureau wanted him to.
Inspector Nischwitz advised Davidson that in the event the Bureau
desired to pursué the matter we would have him contacted.
