. report, O'Donnell was to have been in charge of the assassi-
“ . mation of Patrice Lamumba by agent QUWIN; however, he surveyed

attempt. - ; = i (P)

 

ll. ‘Lawrence Houston. First mentioned oh page 62
of the report. He was requested by Colonel Edwards to call
ook on an Assistant Attorney General to explain the bugging incident
at in Las Vegas. It appears from the IG report that Houston was
Ve witting of aspects of Phase I which led up to the wiretapping
incident. On May 7, 1962, Houston, along with Sheffield
Edwards, briefed Attorney General Kennedy on the Phase I
operation.

12. General Carter. Carter was DDCI under John
: McCone. In April, 1962, he was briefed by Houston on Phase I.
] He said he "understood" the situation and "in due time might
brief the Director, Mr. McCone." However, the 1967 report
states, "There is no indication that General Carter was
further briefed on the full details of the assassination plot
against Castro."

 

13. Robert A. Maheu. Maheu, of course, was the
private investigator who served as the Agency's contact with
Roselli during Phase I.

14. Edward P. Morgan. He was Maheu's attorney in
1966 when the CIA intervened with the Long committee. He
excused Maheu as a witness in its investigation of invasions
of privacy. According to the IG report, Maheu indicated that
he might brief his attorney Morgan fully about his past acti-
vities so that Morgan would be able to decide how best to

represent him.

details of this report, it stated, on page 123, "Orta can.
confirm the pill element of Phase I."

; de Loredo). Varona was used as a funnel for pills in Phase I.
{- He was a prominent member of the Cuban exile community. Varona
