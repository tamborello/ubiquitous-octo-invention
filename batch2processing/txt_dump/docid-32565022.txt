NOTE: Bufalino is presently subject of an INS deportation hearing
in Philadelphia. Sue Nichols testified as a Government witness
5/13/64 at this hearing at which time she admitted being previously i
interviewed by FBI Agents in 1959 or 1960 re subject. Defense Counsel
has requested copies of all information furnished to the FBI by

Nichols concerning subject. This procedure was followed by Defense
Counsel with an earlier witness, J. R. Troup, who had furnished Bureau
Agents a signed statement concerning Troup's association with subject,

| Philadelphia was authorized in that instance to provice a copy of the

| signed statement to INS with the understanding it need not be introduced
| by Bureau personnel. :

{

Witness Nichols information furnished Philadelphia Agents on
6/7/61 concerned Jane Collins being a friend of Bufalino and that she
had observed Bufalino at Club 82 at Pittston, Pennsylvania, which she
believed he owned along with_some dress factories. No other pertinent

information was furnished. Bufalino's paramour, is identical OTHER 4
to PH 665-C-TE. She has advised Philadelphia Agents she will not
i testify at_Bufalino's hearing by invoking the Fifth Amendment. This a

| action by[____]should result in her informant status remaining in- .
tact and eliminate an opportunity for Defense Counsel to inject the
Jencks Law.

Regarding witness ee we must first establish
if he plans to testify. If he invokes the Fifth Amendment, there is no
apparent problem. However, if he does not, we must be prepared to
meet Defense Counsel's ysual request for information furnished by

to the FBI by4 fav ing the pertinent files identified and

 

reviewed.
