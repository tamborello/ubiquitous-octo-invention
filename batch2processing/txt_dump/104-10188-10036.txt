; ‘of the ACOM ineluding thelr travel plans to Mexico and in some cases
\ Cuba, As noted iu paragraph I, E, sbove, the local office of ODENVY .

. considers this coverage "quite valuable”, As also noted in. previous °
renewals; LIFEAT ability to give the interested case officers a check
on active and former agents increases the security of present opera-
tions and provides greater security for long term assets who may have
been in contact with now terminated agente,

H, ‘Conclusica .

It ia’ the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support: provided

other Station operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the .

ability of the LIFEAT oparation to cover sensitive targets

without revealing Station interest to the liaison forces, well Justify :
the expenditure of funds, time, personnel and security risk, Aa it has :

been noted_in the paat, that even with the Station's envolvesent in the
parallel, LIENVOY operation, a change in attitude by
the present or a change in

gould end MJFARK participation in that projeat,
For. that reason, LIFEAT,. in addition.to matntaining ite present heavy
aoverage, mast be available to once again undertake coverage of the
official Seviet and Crech official targets in Mexico City, Therefore,
LIFEAT's present orientation, though toward supporting Station operations
and CI/CE misaion rather than toward targets which would grovide positive
intelligence, leaves Lt readily available for recall into the Soviet-
Czech coverage, It is the Station's firm opinion that the LIFEAT
project provides a substantial and vital contribution in fulfilment the
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I. There is attached a list of the MMs produced from LIFFAT provided
maverial during the period July 1962 through May 1963, as a by-product
of the project's prime responsibility of providing support to Station
cperations,

Il, Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of 8 continuing nature and

are therefore not considered for fulfillment during, any given pertod of
time, Fer this reason percentage figures as to completion of project
objectives camo? be drawn, However, an inafcation.of the coverage
provided tn working tovard fulffliment of the objectives can be noted
in that approximately 12,500 pages of raw text were produced in the
period July L0G] throurh April 1963, LIFEAT has been in dully opera-
tion during the review perfod with the average number of Lines covered
per month being 13, and a high in October 1962 of 23 lines covered,

 

 
 

 

TIT, Planning for the Puture

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes
‘to Femdin uicotmittes to coverages that require the expenditures of
& great portion of LIFFAT resources but provide coverage of but one
target..,such as Soviet Embassy coverage, It is added emphatioally,
: however, that should the need arise for LIFEAT to avain assume such |
- ia responsibilities, it is fully able to do so, Until such time LIFEAT
. wili continue to enloy greater flexibility in the employment of ita
: assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish
: to reveal [

LIFFAT/Mugoslavs In addition to the usual information. concerning
the Yugoslav officials and their daily contacts and activities,
LIPEAT provided leads which could pay off in future operations,

Onn example wag a lead-woic!. revealed that a diplomatic courier
would be travelling alone and taking. a new travel route while
carrying an official pouch, With this early warming, the Station
wae able to plan an operation to provide access to this correspon-
derice, Althoup: Headquarters finally vetoed thie particular oper-
ation, sufficient early warning was given by LIPEAT so that the
opezation could nave been carried out, Another example of this

type of lead wae the data available from LIFFAT coverage that &

new location wag being sought for the Yugoslav Embassy, and which
epecifie iocations were under consideration, Armed with this informa:
tion the Station hs been able to make a technical casing of one of
the prospective sites and obtain information necessary for entry into

the other sites,

LIFEAT/Exile: As noted previously, LIFEAT coverage of the exile
activities was the single major effort by LIFEAT during the project
year, In particular, LIFEAT coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo,
while included lengtny periods of “Live-monttoring”, on occasion
ealied for coverage of five lines, Cabled summaries of LIFEAT

‘information were provided Headquarters and Station Guatemala, It

is believed that the trportance of this LIFEAT coverage gan not be
stressed too mich. LIFEAT Coverage of a Costa Hioan Comminiat exile
regident in Mexico City has lead to a wealth of operational leads
ineluding the dizcovery of this person's envolvement in a Communist
funding mechaniz:, Also, LYFFAT wan active in covering the Spanish
Republican exile community in Mexico City during the GPIDEAL visit |
to Kexico, LIFEAT coverage in this case was considered necessary

to reveal trmediately any renewal of an earlier planned attempt on
tne itfe of an OYOVE official by one group of the Republican Exiles,
Ultizetely, LIFEAT revealed the departure from Mexico of two of the
ringleaders in tre plot,

LIFEAT/CI/CE: At Headquarters request LIFEAT BRKERAFS was established
on a former SMOTH agent whose past actions gave’for some suspicion of
his present activities, Preduct from this line has revealed an effort
by a group of this individual's friends to discredit the senior ChACID
official in Mexico, Early warntns by LIFEAT has made possible the
preparation of counter action (see HMVA-21264), LIFRAT has also
provided coverage cf a suspected RIS support agent. This coverage
had provided the background material necessary for checking on the
activities of this suspect axent, Continuing LIrEA? reporting on the
American Communist Group in:Mexico (ACGM) has provided ODENVY «with
great quantities of information on agiivities of leftist friends of

 
 

 

 

LIFEAT/Soviets: The valuable assistance which LIFEAT rendered Station .

: &fforts in this area was aspliy displayed in its support of Station
assets mounting a technical surveillance operation targeted against
the home of a known Soviet intelligence officer stationed in Mexico
City under official cover, LIETAT information provided vital infor-

_ mation whicn enabled: the Station to‘establish a pattern of action, ~~
of both the family of the Seviet officer and his maid. This infor-
mation made possible the setting of a time for the actual entry into
the target, and continuing coverage (including live monitoring of the

. target line immediately preceeding the operation) by LIFEAT made
possible « degree of security for this operation which would not have
been possible without the support of a tap operation,

Purther LEIFEAT coverage has, in addition to giving information on
the daily activities and contacts of Soviet officials, provided an ex-

- eellent cheek on the contacts of three KURARK controlled double agents
with their Soviet Case Officers, This coverage has enabled the reepon-
Sible Case Officer to guide his operations with increased assurance
that his agents continue to be fully cooperative and under his control,

 

 

 

LIFEAT/Cuban: LIFEAT activities in this area were concerned primarily
with suppert to the AMSTRUT cperation, Coverage of relatives of
AMSTRUT-2 provided an excellent “window” into the operation which

enabled the responsible Case Officers to move with more certainty

and security in developing¢his operation, The Case Officers involved
considered the LIFEAT coverece an essential check on the activities of
the principals in the case which was especially valuable during the
initial stages of the operation, Travel plans of AMSTRUT-2 provided

by LIFEAT were also essential ta the timing of the operation, Also

in the Cuban area LIFEAT coverage of G-2 agent enabled the Station’ .
to gain an insight into his contacts and activitios, Further, recent .
initiation of coverage of a Cuban Comreroial Official gives evidence

of producing solid information of ccumercial transactions and Mexican
Commercial contacts of the Cudan Government,

LIFEAT/Polish; LIFEAT continzed its coverage in the REKNAVE/SECHICK
operation, (See previous protect renewal for background of this case
and the LIFEAT participation in it.) Of great interest to this operation
was LIFEAT information indicatins that the wife of HEXNAVE had become
aware of his interest in another soman, and later revelation of reassign-
ment and travel plans of SEXNAVT. 7

American Communist Group in Mexico {ACGH). so

As noted in. :past project reviews, most of the targets in this group
have been covered at the request of QUENVY, and the raw take has been
processed by them. buring tne period July 1962 through May 1963
approximately 390 reels of take were passed to the local ODENVY for
their processing. On 23 August 1052 the local ODENVY advised, "This
office feels the coverage mentioned is quite valuable and many .useful
leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly with regard to
travel in and out of Mexico of American Communists who are in contact
with individuals on whom coverage is maintained”, Typical examples
of reporting based on LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM are: ......

Exile and Revolutionary Activities

During the past year this area of activity, in additfon to the already
noted Cuban coverage, accounted for the greatest percentage of the
LIFEAT effort. Most of the information provided by LIFEAT in its
coverage of targets in this area was not available from other sources.
while Coverage has been provided on Spanish Republican, Guatemalan,
Costa Rican, and Nicaraguan exiles, the bulk of this product has
resulted from the coverage of Juan Jose AREVALO Rermejo and various of
his acquaintances, the "take" being forwarded to Headquarters and Station
Guatemala by either weekly cable summaries or immediate action cables
when warranted, It is noted that the coverage has been most rewarding
in the case of AREVALO and the recent coverage of

I, Product of the Project
A, Soviet Coverage . i. .

: .
Project LIFEAT has not provided coverage of the entire Soviet official
installation in Mexico City since 22 June 1960 when Project LIENVOY

ee responsibility, This freed LIFEAT to provide, with its
coverage, home phones of selected Soviet officials which
c er support not only the Station's CE effort but alse other
Station operations against the Soviet target. In this effort, LIFEAT
a covered the homes of four of the more active Soviet Intelligence

Officers stationed in Mexico during the reporting period. Samples
of the operational information provided by LIFEAT follows:

c. Yugoslav Coverage

LIFEAT coverage of the Vigostav. official installation in Mexico City
has provided @ wealth of information on th? contacts, activities, and-
travel of members of that mission, Since thé Station's effort against
this target was greatly increased within the last year, LIFEAT infor-
mation has been used extensively to provide the basic operational and
‘ personality- data necessary for this stepped-up program, Examples of
LIFEAT produced positive intelligence and general operational informa-
tion on this target are as follows:

 

HMMA-19311, 10 July 1962 (Activity of the CP of Yugoslavia in

During the reporting period LIFEAT coverage of the Cuben target was
directed toward the support of KUBARK operations in this field and was
not designed to provide positive intelligence, LIFEAT covered a total
of 10 lines in direct support of operations in this field, Most of
the product of this area of operation was forwarded by cable to JMWAVE
and Headquarters, Examples ef pouch communications in this fleld ares
