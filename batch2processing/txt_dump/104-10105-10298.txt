MEMORANDUM FOR: THE RECORD
SUBJECT : Howard Hunt's Letter to Gene Fodor

(we me, JP

1. Attached hereto is a note,from Gene Fodor submitting a copy
of a letter he received from Howard Hunt relative to the New York Time
story which identified Gene Fodor as a CIA agent.

2. Ina telephone conversation during the week of 13 January
1975 with CCS/COB, Gene Fodor reported receipt of the letter and
expressed his desire to write an answer to Mr. Hunt. It is Mr. Fodor's
opinion that the answer: should point out to Mr. Hunt that the release
of such information could do great harm to Mr. Fodor's relatives in
Czechoslovakia. This same theme is repeated in Mr. Fodor's trans-
mittal letter where he asks for an Agency opinion on how to proceed.

3. -In answer to Mr. Fodor, CCS/COB telephoned him on 23 January
and gave the opinion that a simple acknowledgment letter was the best
course of action if he insisted upon giving some type of answer to
Mr. Hunt. CCS/COB discouraged Mr. Fodor in his answer to Mr. Hunt
from dealing with any of the subjects raised in Mr. Hunt's letter,
and Mr. Fodor made the comment that perhaps a simple sterile acknow- ~

- Jedgment would suffice. It is CCS/COB's opinion that he will proceed

along those lines.

4. Mr. Fodor is concerned about possible testimony before a
Senate committee, as suggested in Mr. Hunt's letter. He says that
he has forgotten a number of facts about his Agency relationship,
and wonders if he will have an opportunity to review files or receive
a briefing in the event that he must testify. CCS/COB said that we
would have to deal with that whole problem at such time as he was
called to testify.

5. Mr. Fodor has received inquiries from many places in the
world where his books are read and sold, and he claims that his
cooperation with the Agency has already been announced on the radio
in Czechoslovakia. This latter fact is of great concern to him
because he fears that something will happen to his relatives in

13 January 1975

Mr. Eugene Fodor
Litchfield, Connecticut

Dear Mr. Fodor:

I want you to. know that I greatly regret the em-
barrassment caused you by the New York Times' revelation
of my executive session testimony given in confidence to
the Ervin Committee more than a year ago. Senator Baker
and Minority Counsel Thompson gave me assurances that I
was authorized to reveal classified CIA matters to the
Select Committee, and I did so on. the assumption that the
testimony would not be publicly revealed.

A UPI story of today's date quotes you as stating
that you and I never met, or had any dealings, and that of

. course is not accurate.

Unless the Agency has destroyed the files of all CIA
projects with which I was involved there should be a re-

cord of at least one meeting between you and me at a CIA

office in Washington's({ __ I mention this
by way of refreshing your memory, for I expect that both of

‘us may be summoned before the CIA Investigating Committee

within the near future.

Again, it was not my desire that you suffer in any
way because of your relationship with CIA and our late
mutual friend, Charlie. Leaking classified information is
both illegal and reprehensible whether done by Daniel
Ellsberg or a Senate Committee staff member; it also seems
to be a non-prosecutable offense, particularly when the
recipient is the New York Times.

Sincerely,
een a:
