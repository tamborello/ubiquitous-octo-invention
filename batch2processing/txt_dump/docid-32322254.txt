Dear Dr. Peter Frisch: - a oe ot PRY

Tam writing to you about a matter that I believe to be important to the FBI andto the =

United States people.

The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C.§2107(Supp.
V 1994) (the Act) (copy enclosed) was enacted by the United States Congress and signed into law by
President George Bush on October 26, 1992. The purpose of the Act is to preserve and maintain all
United States governmental documents in one area, the National Archives and Records Administration
(Archives), for access to those individuals interested in the history surrounding the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy. The Act states that, “[a]ll government records conceming the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of immediate disclosure,” and
requires all United States government agencies to find all documents related to the assassination and to
review and release the identified documents to the maximum extent possible to the public. The FBI
has been working diligently since 1993 to fulfill our responsibilities under the Act. -

The purpose of this letter is: (1) to inform you that the FBI’s assassination records contain
information originating with your agency or your original documents, (2) to respectfully request that
your agency review your information for maximum disclosure to the fullest extent possible, and (3) to ©

explain the provisions for your request to protect your information from disclosure, « ¢ 4 .

To achieve maximum disclosure of assassination records, the Act established the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board (the Board). The Board is an independent Federal agency
charged with overseeing the identification and release of records related to the assassination from the
other Federal agencies. The FBI has assured the Board of our continued dedication of cooperating
with them to meet the objectives of the Act. In that spirit, the FBI would appreciate =~
