Date of transcription —

GORGE BEN EDMONDSON was contacted at his home,
Route 2, Box 179, Walla Walla, Washington (509-525-2126),
where he is living under the assumed name of ALEX P.
BORMANN and employed by the Boise Cascade Company.

EDMONDSON was advised of the Bureau policy requiring
its own Waiver for the release of information and that such a
Waiver would authorize the Bureau to release all information
concerning him, even that which had previously been considered
confidential. EDMONDSON acknowledged that he understood the
Bureau policy and specifically stated that it was his under-
standing that his 1959 confidential FBI file would be released
to the House Select Committee on Assassinations, if so requested.

 

EDMONDSON also expressed concern that the House Select
Committee on Assassinations would not be able to maintain proper
control of the information in his file, pointing out that
investigators for the Committee, to whom he has spoken, appear
to be a little young and lacking in *sxperience. EDMONDSON
stated, however, that he would cont:.ue cooperate with the
Committee, and executed the following Waiver authorizing
release of information:

"AUTHORITY TO RELEASE INFORMATION

 

"TI hereby authorize any Special Agent or other
authorized representative of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation bearing this release, to furnish to the House Select
Committee on Assassinations all information in its possession
concerning me, including those records pertaining to my confi-
dential relationship with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I realize that by authorizing this release I will disclose to
the House Select Committee on Assassinations any confidential
relationship I may have had with the FBI.
