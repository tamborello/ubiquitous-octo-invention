Re: EJERCITO SECRETO DE CUBA (ESC)

The Ejercito Secreto De Cuba is believed to be an
anti-Castro Cuban exile (ACE) terrorist group operating out
aprot Miami, Florida, and affiliated with the United Revolu-
9 .tionary Organization (URO). The URO is an umbrella organi-
zation based in Latin America which came into being when
five ACE terrorist groups met in Santo Domingo, Dominican
Republic, on 11-12 June 1976. Since its formation under
the leadership of Orlando Bosch Avila, the URO has claimed
responsibility for several acts of terrorism in the Caribbean
and Meso America.

C

. In July 1976, the ESC began sending a logograph
(photocopy attached) to several Canadian facilities and
businesses in Canada and abroad which appeared to be a
warning of some sort, They have also sent the same logo-
graph to the Cuban and Czech Consulates in Montreal. The
bulk of the mail sent by the ESC was post-marked Miami,
Florida. As of late September, there had been a total of
eight such warnings of which we are aware, They were sent
| to the following: !

 

Four to Pickford and Black, Halifax, Nova Scotia
(shipping agents)

One to the Canadian Consulate General, New York, NY

One to the Canadian Consulate General, Boston, Mass.

One to the Cuban Consulate, Montreal, Canada ey)

This is further to my Headquarters' letter
dated August 25, 1976 directed to you concerning the
captioned organization. At that time we asked you for
any data you might have concerning the ESC because of the
fact that warning letters had been sent to several
Canadian establishments, public and private, at home and
abroad.

Recently ESC has come to our attention again
and we are speculating that it may be tied in with the
“UNITED RE: UTIONARY..ORGANIZATION (URO) headed by Orlando

that time has claimed responsibility for several terrorist

i Recently several Canadian establishments, public and

' private, at home and abroad have received letters post marked
Miami, Florida, U.S.A. The letters contain the words EJERCITO
SECRETO DE CUBA written near a red triangle with a white star in
the centre. It is felt that this is the work of an Anti-Castro
Cuban Exile (ACE) terrorist or terrorist group and is meant as a
warning to those who receive it. :

26 We have had the writing analysed by our handwriting

- expert, Sgt. Robert FAWCET, from the R.C.M.P. Crime Detection
Laboratory and he states that the addresses on the front of the
three envelopes we have at this headquarters were written by the
same person. . .

3. We would appreciate any data you may have regarding a

group calling itself the Secret Army of Cuba (SAC) presumed to be
operating out of Miami. We are attaching photocopies of each
letter and its’contents for your perusal and information.~

Yours truly,
