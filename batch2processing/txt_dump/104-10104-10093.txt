has revealed the following information: An Operational
Approval was requested by the Miami Station on 29 January
1962 to utilize him as an External Coordinator for an

infiltration group in Cuba. The Approval was granted on

6 March 1962. He was afforded technical interrogation in
the Miami area in May 1962 and successfully answered all
pertinent questions without any indications of deception.
However, it was decided not advisable to continue our
relationship with him; therefore, his approval was cancelled

one million dollars because of damage to his reputation.
