representative of the NBC was taking pictures of some
parachtite jumpers representing themselves supposedly

as Cuban éxiles in training. However, these jumpers

were actually American sperts jumpers.

According to MM T-2, Colonel LEON took some guns
along with his party hoping to have photographs taken of .
him and his companions in training but due to restrictions
of the Sheriff's Office, . which covered that field, no. weapons
were removed from automobiles occupied by LEON and his
companions.

‘MM T-2 said that PAULINO SIERRA has no training
bases located anywhere although he is always talking of
grandiose plans to.set up camps through his alleged
connections with important officials.in Latin America.

It is to be noted that previous investigation has reflected
that FACE is a small anti- CASTRO organization headquartered
in Miami.
