Rerep SA VERNON G, WALTERS, Detroit, 10/15/63.

Since submission of rerep, Dept. Attorney WILLIAM FRENCH has
not been in’ Detroit. Through his office at Detroit, FRENCH
telephonically.-requested a preliminary inquiry regarding an
allegation received by him from a Department source. This
source had hearsay information that during the FDIC examination
of Public Bank (which provided the basis for investigation in
captioned case) a substantial loan from Public Bank to Redford
Iron Works, Inc., (RIW) was in serious difficulty; and that
JOSEPH F. VERHELLE, president of Public Bank, allegedly caused
HARRY S, LEVINE of Ewald Steel Sales & Supply Co. to “the

  

Liability for the loan. LEVINE allegedly did so with the }
understanding that it was just for the duration of the FDIC

examination; but he was not later relieved of this liability
by VERHELLE.

  
 
    
  
   
     
   
   
         
       
   
    

 

  

FRENCH requested inquiry to determine whether there appears
to be any basis for the above allegations and whether there
was any connection indicated with the matters under investi-
gation in this case,

Review of the FDIC report of examination of Public Bank and
other records indicated extensive business dealings with Public
Bank by RIW, Ewald Steel Sales & Supply Co., LEVINE, arid IRWIN
J, KASOFF, an associate of LEVINE. Former president of RIW,
CHARLES A, HORIST, advised LEVINE and KASOFF appeared to have
influence at Public Bank; and VERHELLE and JEROME J. ZIELINSKI,
a vice president of Public Bank, may have helped them get
control of RIW. No connection was indicated with (occ Sonor
; other loans previously investigated in this ease.” 7
