PHIL (LNU) and FREDDIE (LNU), both from Indiana County

and the latter an official with the local of the Iron workers
Union. Then he heard that BAZZANO was going into some sort of
a deal with PHIL to operate a hotel in that area. Somebody
went to KELLY MANNARINO and falsely informed him that informant
had a Silent piece of PHIL's share of the new venture and that
informant hoped. BAZZANO. was not going into the deal with the
idea of fleecing PHIL. Shortly thereafter, MANNARINO brought
in BAZZANO,sat him down and told him that he should either
operate the hotel deal on the square or not go into it at all.
Reportedly, BAZZANO assured MANNARINO that his intentions were |
strictly legitimate.

E, LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE :
On January 25, 1971, PG T-3 advised;

GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO reputedly owns 51% of a i
_ firm known as Paragon Plastics in the New Kensington - Allegheny i
River Valley area and the other owner is allegedly NEIL HAGEAL. '
Some of associates of MANNARINO and individuals that work in
his organization are "SPEEDO" HANNA, who is a torpedo, and ; i
also an individual known as "'BAD EYE", who is married to ,
HAGEAL's sister.

This information is just rumor among gamblers in
the New Kensington area, and if is known fhat when he is in . |
town, MANNARINO spends no time at Paragon Plastics and con-
_tinues to actively operate Catoris Candies, Inc.

Fy TRAVEL

On January 15, 1971, RAYMOND ECHEMENT, Deputy U.S.
Marshal, Pittsburgh, telephonically advised SA THOMAS G,
FORSYTH, III, that GABRIEL MANNARINO had just boarded United
Airlines Flight Number 905, which departed Pittsburgh at,
9:0 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, en route to Ft. Lauderdale,
‘Fla. He said MANNARINO, traveling under his own name, had
a male traveling companion, no description obtained, who was.
travéling under the name S, MANNARINO.

 

: It is noted that SAMUEL MANNARINO, subject's brother,
has been dead for about four years, and no other MANNARINO-
is known to have a first name commencing with the letter "Ss,"

Yesterday INS 4
informant and said thet KELLY MANNARINO wanted to see him, :
Informant met with MANNARINO at the latter's ranch in Allegheny
Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, on the morning of
7/27/71, : : : :

MANNARINO said he has a friend “out west". who is in
trouble, and 'I¥may have to help him," | MANNARINO wouldn't tell
informant anything. more but merely insisted informant keep

'himgelf instantly available to leave to "do a job" for this
unidéntified friend ofhig, - MANNARINO said informant could
take along a partner of his own choosing or he could take
SONNY CIANCUTTI.’ MANNARINO turned to CIANCUTTI and said,
"You go with him and get dirty; it's about time." Informant
has no additional information at this time, ; .

. MANNARINO then asked informant if he knew GALLO in
New York, and informant said he only knows what he reads about
GALLO in magazines, MANNARINO asked if informant knew what
GALLO looks like, and informant said he has.only seen magazine
photographs of GALLO. MANNARINO then said, "He may come up
next;'" and MANNARINO said no more, :

From his conversation with MANNARINO, during which’
he did not ask any questions since so doing would be
uncharacteristic, he can only. surmise. that MANNARINO may have
been talking about a "hit" for his friend "out west" or a
"muscle job" or a "burglary," but there is no way of being
sure without more information, Informant will try to get
additional information from CIANCUTTI if possible,
