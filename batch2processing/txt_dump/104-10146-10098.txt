components seem to have been involved: :

After there has been time to consider the problems that will

Services Division for priority reproduction of the HSCA
draft report immediately upon receipt. The number of
copies will be determined by agreement among the above
parties. Distribution of copies will be by hand on a
priority basis. Various components will be organized for
an intensive review for both security and substantive
issues of the sections affecting them. In essence, each
component will prepare two different responses, one dealing
solely with security considerations and the other dealing
with factual corrections and disagreements with interpreta-
tion and presentation. These papers will be prepared and
forwarded to OLC which will consolidate the responses into
a single response. That paper will be reviewed in a
working session by designated representatives of the
various organizations. :

MEMORANDUM FOR : Deputy Director for Operations
Deputy Director for Administration ;
Deputy Director for Science §& Technology
General Counsel

FROM : S. D. Breckinridge

SUBJECT : Planning for the Final HSCA Report

1. We have asked the HSCA to arrange to give us
sections of its report at different times to facilitate
our review and response. There has been no response to
this request although it has been made both in writing
and orally.

2. The Memorandum of Understanding with the Committee
provides that the Committee will notify the DCI in writing
of its desire to disclose any information designated for
protection by the DCI. Until advised to the contrary
(and we will try to clarify it) our working assumption
is that the submission of the final report to us will
constitute a written notice of the desire to have the material
in that report published. If the Committee does not receive
a response "within five days," objecting to this and stating
the reasons, then the Committee may disclose the information.
There are provisions for subsequent exchanges on the point
but the key provision is the first five-day period.

3. AS a practical matter we will have two separate

“reviews to conduct--a security review and a substantive

review. We probably should plan to conduct the two reviews
at the same time. Our formal agreement clearly provides

for our right to take a stand in opposition to disclosure

of sensitive material. We have been told that the Committee
will also receive and consider any factual corrections

that we offer and any statements of disagreement that we

6. A common criteria for security review and pro-

posed sanitization will be necessary to insure some

rational standard and some degree of consistency in
applying it. Fairly simple instructions will come the
Closest to meeting the requirements of such an operation
and the attached guidelines present a useful point of
departure in considering it. They were developed after
some experience with the problem during the Church
Committee investigations. While longer guidelines exist, -
they are not practical for a pressure operation such as
this will be.

7. Present HSCA planning is to have available for
our review a Summary Report to be considered by the full
Committee in public sessions mid-November. The Staff
Summary of the investigations are planned for mid- to late-
December. We should be ready in early November for the

first round.
