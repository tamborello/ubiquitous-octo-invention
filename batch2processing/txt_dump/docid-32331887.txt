ZERVOS refused because he had only been recently released

from the Western State Penitentiary after serving 224

years after conviction for murder and suggested to ABRAHAM

that they take the cigarettes to GABRIEL MANNARINO (Pittsburgh

top hoodlum) whe owned the S & S Distributing Company, a-.

cigarette vending machine concern. :

In the presence of ZERVOS, ABRAHAM told the Syrian man and
.MAINER that if ZERVOS would not put up any money he was ; ,
not in a position to take ‘the load himself but offered to

take them to MANNARINO in his own car; ABRAHAM left with

the two individuals and looked up GABRIEL MANNARINO who ~
presumably bought the entire stolen shipment. : i

ZERVOS noticed the Syrian man in New Kensington a number
of 'times after their initial meeting, driving a black
station wagon, not further described, and assumes that he :
regularly supplied the S & S Distributing Company with

stolen cigarettes for at least three or four months since
during his first meeting with the group, the Syrian man offered
to supply cigarettes. regularly, . .

_ZERVOS has not. seen the Syrian man or MAINER in New Kensington
for the past year and one-half but observed MAINER several

times after their initial meeting in the lobby of the Kenmar ~ .
Hotel and also in the Laetus Club.

ZERVOS also speculated that MAINER and his companion could
have sold other shipments of stolen cigarettes to JOSEPH :

GIORDANO, aka "RED," operator of the Bachelor's Club in |
New Kensington, and a long-time fence. “i

vo : ZERVOS is of the opinion that MAINER's eonnections in. . :
New Kensington would be with members of the MANNARINO :
mob as a result of his original | introduction to ‘MANNARINO
or GIORDANO through ABRAHAM. my
ZERVOS is” extremely reluctant to make any open inquiries 4a
concerning MAINER in New Kensington and considers it :
highly inadvisable for him to do so at the .risk of disclosure
as a source of information,

ZERVOS. examined photographs of GEORGE VICTOR ZUGRAVE,
FBI Number 2878523, SAMUEL’ JOSEPH MESSARIS, FBI Number 80808,
and FLOREA.but was unable to recognize them. |

call from C, HOWARD HARDESTY, JR., of the Furbee and Hardesty
Law Firm of Fairmont which firm is representing the Dupont ~

Air Interests in the recovery of the twin engine Beech Aircraft
piloted by. SUTOR. Mr. MORGAN also pointed out that this

is the same firm that. employs ROBERT SARVER and added that

' HARDESTY told him that SARVER might possibly represent SUTOR.

MORGAN said that the Beech Craft was released by the
government and would be turned over to the Dupont Air Interests
on February 5,°1959. He also said that it-is his understanding -

. that if SARVER eventually represents SUTOR he, SARVER, intends

to strongly advise SUTOR to cooperate with Special Agents of

. Deputy Sheriff RIDGLEY, Faiimont; on January 26, 1959, advised

SA WATSON that on the same date he censored a letter received

but is being shunned by the racket element for his foolishness
in becoming involved in such an undertaking. TEEMER said that

PQ 52-1687 | Ponti dg:

On instructions from SAM GIARUSSO, RICCI went to Newburgh,
New York, and obtained a sample MG from TRAPINI on
September 4, 1958. RICCI took the MG to the Pygmalion Club,

New York City, where he met SAM GIARUSSO and they in turn went

to the Warwick Hotel also in New York City. They parked
in front of the hotel and a man, later identified as JOE
MEROLA, approached the car, took the MG from RICCI and
entered the hotel. RICCI and SAM GIARUSSO then returned
to the Pygmalion Club. Shortly thereafter, MEROLA
entered the club and handed the MG back to RICCI and said,
"This is what I want, get me all you can, but clean them

up."

RICCI returned to his home in Middletown, New Jersey, with the
MG. .

On September 11, 1958, RICCI was arrested by ATU Agents at
his home and the following items were seized:

1 .45 caliber Thompson MG, SN 750471 —
6 Cases of M-1 Carbine parts
1 1958 Edsel station wagon (RICCI's auto)

It has been determined that RICCI legitimately purchased the

M-1 Carbine parts for $1000 cash from THOMAS A. GREALY,

Grealy Arms Company, 448 Pompton Avenue, Cedar Grove,

#10 Jersey. RICCI stated that SAM GIARUSSO furnished the
1000. ; ;

Since RICCI's arrest, JOE GIARUSSO has made several contacts
with RICCI, who is out on bail, for more guns. JOE

GIARUSSO said that "Bayonne JOE" is interested in securing

a source for quantity of American-type guns. "Bayonne

JOE" is JOSEPH ZICARELLI, a top hoodlum in the Newark Office.

It should be noted that the above information was acquired
by ATU. Agents from RICCI on a confidential basis, They are
presently attempting to develop RICCI as an informant and,
therefore, request that none of the above information be
disseminated outside the FBI.
