“FROM: SAC, PITTSBURGH (92-226)
e SUBJECT: SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, aka.; ,
i AR

ReBuairtel to New York, captioned, “CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE
PROGRAM, " dated 2/15/61.

PG 585-C has advised that FRANCES PRIAM, former paramour of LA
ROCCA, is now doing a fairly good business as a medium-priced
prostitute in the Baum Blivd., area of Pittsburgh, where’ she is
operating with a girlfriend who has not been exposed to the
rackets. This informant advised that the Phoenix Motel at !
Monroeville, Pa., which is operated by MIKE GENOVESE, Pittsburgh, -
@nd National Top Hoodlum, who is the protege of LA ROCCA, has |
become virtually flocded with prostitutes who are working on :
independent basis with the approval of GENOVESE who ostensibly \
has the approval of LA ROCCA. In this regard, Thursday nights !
appear to be extremely active because a free-food spread, buffet
style, is laid out by the motel management for all of the drinking
customers. Local racket men seeking action prefer this night of
the week and most have light dinners so that they can gorge ;
themselves with Italian delécdeies from about 10:30 P. Me, to an '
2:00 A.M.

IN VIEW OF THE CONVICTION OF LA ROCCA FOR ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO oo
KILL AND HIS ARREST FOR CA NG A CONCEALED WEAPON HE MAY BE :

S ARMED AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS -
