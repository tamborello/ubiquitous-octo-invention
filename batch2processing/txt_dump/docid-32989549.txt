VIEW OF RAYMOND .b%

. On 10/23/75, I was interviewed by two members of the Senate
Select Committee, Mrs. Mary DeOreo and Mr. Mark Gitenstein, at the Dirksen
Building in the office of the Senate Select Committee. The interview began at
10:30 a.m. and ended at Noon. I was not advised of anything pertaining to my
rights.

 
 

 

The following are questions asked and the answers I gave, to the
best of my recollection:

QUESTION: When you went to the platform that morning - was it the day after
Mr. Hoover died, or two days later?

ANSWER: I can't remember.
QUESTION: On that particular morning in question, what did you do?

ANSWER: I went out to the platform and I found the truck sitting funny and I
wasn't sure if I had a flat tire or what. I checked the rear tires, but
found the tires were up so that I figured something was on the truck.

I can't remember if the truck was locked or what, but when I opened the
truck it was loaded with cabinets from front to back. I questioned my
supervisor, Tony Codi, about the cabinets on the truck. To his knowledge
he didn't know where they came from. He went around to the front office
to check and was told that the cabinets were te go to Mr. Hoover's house.

QUESTION: Who gave Codi the message to take the cabinets out to Mr. Hoover" s.
house?

ANSWER: It could have been Mr. Marsden or Mr. Gregory. I don't know which.
Tony double checked to find out who was going out to Mr. Hoover's house.
after I questioned him if the moving crew was going. I was told there would
be no one going, but there would be a car following the truck.

QUESTION: Did you recognize the car or did you see it? |

ANSWER: I couldn't tell the car from any other car out there in the street. :

QUESTION: Did the car beat you to the house? |

ANSWER: I didn't know if the car beat me there or not because there were other
cars parked there.

QUESTION: Where were the cabinets unloaded ?

ANSWER: They were unloaded at the side gate. . |
