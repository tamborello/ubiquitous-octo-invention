SUBJECT: Appraisal of Interrogation

.

I. The eagerness of the subject to help and his
expressions of regret for having neglected opportunities jor more
detailed observations Left me with mixed reactions. In my opinion
is attitude detracted from his etheuvise seemingly genuine

this
“manner and at Least for me it "watered down” his attempt to generate

@ repentant imprcssion,

2. The subject readily answered questions and was extremely
friendly during both neriods of interrogation. Plottings and data,
however, by the subject on a blank Loum plan Left him for homework
tater proved disoriented, The subject discovered his error during
our second meeting and volunteered corrections,

the interrogation provided data on a plant previously described
as possibly in the electronics business as a probable radar storage
and aepain area. A hitherto unknown naval installation was also
identified and located. The pivot plant of the subject's emoloying
énstitute was identified and located in an area other than the one
previously assumed,

4, It can be said that if the subject's bond fides are
definitely established, nositive intelligence gathered from hin 8
of read value. ; mo :
