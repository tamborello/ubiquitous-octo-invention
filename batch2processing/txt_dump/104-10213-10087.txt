3. There was such a memorandum, w.itten by a case
officer then stationed in Par’ :, recently released wider FOIA,
Writing three days after Pre: dent Kounedy's assaxsination,
this case officer recalled that there had been interest in Oswald,

As soon as [had heard Oswald's name, t recalled
that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had diseussei --
sometime in the summer of 1940 -- with the tren
Chief and Deputy Chief of tne § Rese: ion
the laying on of interview (s) througe WWTUMD or
other suitable channels...

 
  

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the
USSR had struck me from the moment I! had cecd
the first ODACID.dispatch on him, and I told my
subordinates something amcunting to '"Don': push
too hard to get the informaticn we need, because
this individual look: odd,"

+o « « Ido not know whst action ceveloped there-
after. sas

The Welms testimony before the Warren Commission

on this subject was as follows:

Mr. Helms. On Mr. McCone's behalf, I had all

our records searched to see if there had been

any contacts at any time prior to President Kennedy's
assassination by anyone in the Centril Intelligence
Agency with Lee Harvey Oswald. We checked our
card files and our personal files and all our records.

Now this check turned out to be negative. In addition
I got in touch with those officers who were in’ positions

of responsibility at the times in question to sec if : .

anybody had any recollection of any contact having
even been suggested with this man. This also turned
out to be negative, so there is nd material in the
Central Intelligence Agency, either in the records or
in the mind of any of the individuals, that there was
any contact had or even contemplated with him.

MEMORANDUS. FOR: Director of Central Intcliigence

FROM : John H. Waller
Inspector General
SUEJECT : Washington Star Story, 1 October 1576
1, This is for your information only.

2.

On 1 October 1976 the Washington Star published a news

story with an Associated Press credit line, headlined CLA
Viewed Oswald As Information Source (copy attached), The
lead stated:

Contrary to sworn testimony, the CIA once con-
sidered using presidential assassin Lee Harvey
Oswald as a source of intelligence information -.
about the Sovict Union, according to anewly .
released CIA document.

In sworn testimony before the Warren Commission,
forrmer CIA Director Richard Helms said the
Agency never had “or even coatemplated"' any
contacts with Oswald.

The news story, in another section, made the following
statements

The November 25, 1983, memo explained that
the Agency's interest in Oswald as a potential
intelligence source was duc to his "unusual
behavior in the USSR, * to which he had defected
in 1959,

One otter te en eaeen enone coms sents messes

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

5. Mr. Helms did state exactly the words quoted in the © -
news story -- Yor even contemplated." But the context of
those words was what was reported to him as the result of
a search of records and memories. To this day those
familiar with the extensive Oswald records state that there
is no reflection in those records that anyone even undertook
to propose or approve a contact with Oswald. It would have
been natural to do so, but apparently any such thoughts did
not progress to formal action. From the memorandum
quoted, it is epparent that someone at Branch level ‘id think | :
about it, even if uothing ever came of it. This hardly con-
stitutes a responsible or official or serious “contemplation't
of the idea. Mr. Helms! full statement on this point seems
literally corcect in the full context of his statement, although
more refined qualifications might have reiterated the basis
for his conclusions. The news story is misleadixg on this
point.

6. The news story statement that Oswald was considered
due to his “unusual behavior in the USSR,' is exactly the
opposite of the statements of the quoted memorandum, which
reported the care that should be used if Oswald were approached,
because of his strange conduct.

% The statement in the news story about Mr. Dulles
consulting with Agency personnel on how to answer questioas
is basically true, The interpretation to be placed oa this _
counseiling will depend on the interpreter. The infercace of
the news story is that Mr. Dulles was counselling slanted |
responses on the Oswald issue, thereby tending to reinforce
the interpretation of deception attriby sted to Mr. Helms.
