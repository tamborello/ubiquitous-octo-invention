During the above conference, ‘a discussion
ensued as to whether SCLC should institute a- policy
_of charging admission to Reverend KING's speeches. ee
Reverend KING deciared it had always been his feeling
_ that the public should hear him free of charge. LEVISON |
objected to Reverend KING's thought in this regard and
‘said in-his opinion the civil rights. movement as a
whole had reached a point where the public should expect
to pay in order to hear Reverend KING speak. A decision
was ; not reached concerning this matter. sO :

(AT 7, 11/66)

: Also during the aforementioned. conference,

a discussion took place regarding SCLC approaching.
‘leading officials of labor organizations for financial
contributions. STANLEY LEVISON referred to a meeting
recently held between Reverend - KING and. JAMES HOFFA,
President of the. Teamsters Union. -Hé pointed out this ©
had been an excellent meeting and very. "fruitful" (not.
explained). LEVISON suggested SCLC consider utilizing ©:
HOFFA's: cooperation and selling individual memberships —
in°SCLC to influential Negro and ‘white’ persons * within the
sphere of HOFFA's influence including people both in and
out of organized labor. He contended. that HOFFA knows .~

- Many such people who would be only too happy to become ’

' affiliated with SCLC through an honorary-type membership -

'. . and periodically assist SCLC financially.

we tee

. LEVISON went on to suggest that the sale
‘* of memberships through. the assistance of HOFFA not be :
. limited to proféssional people but include the so-called
working class. He made effort to differentiate between
professional groups and the working class by pointing
out that it will be the working class, “not: the professional
people, who will ultimately look to SCLC for assistance ~”
in seeking "social change" (not defined). Thereafter, -~
LEVISON said SCLC could use this and its working class

memberships as a practical lever when seeking "Social
change".
