ADMINISTRATIVE

The investigative period of this report overlaps

. investigative period of previous report due to the fact that
WFO was not in receipt of the results of investigation of
auxilary offices at the time the last report was prepared.

Through established liaison, local law enforcement
agencies are being made aware of all pertinent facts contained
in this report.

te Miami is directed to referenced teletype in which MM
337 a sed on 5/6/75 that on the night of 5/5/75

; STA. received a telephone call from RIGUEZ
poe erto Rico. RODRIGUEZ spoke "double talk" Aut the meaning
was clear to STA. RODRIGUEZ said that "our small brother
will be working tomorrow or the day after." He then said that
this "brother" would be working because the OAS is meeting.
RODRIGUEZ added that ACOSTA would be called again "when the

work is done" so that he could "take care of the rest."

 
  
  
  

   
 

Source said that "our small brother" is a phrase the
FLNC usually uses to refer to."ELAC", the name used by FLNC
when taking credit for a bombing. The phrase "take care of
the rest" means the news release, which would be given out
in Miami.

in the Miami area that the two individuals responsible for
the recent bombings during the conference of the Organization
of American States at Washington, D. C., during May, 1975,
are FELIPE RIVERO and his associate RAMON LNU. Source de-
scribed RIVERO as being the leader of Los Nacionalistas, a
small Cuban exile group in Miami, and RAMON as being the
second in charge. RIVERO, who is about 48 years of age, was
a prisoner in Cuba after the Bay of Pigs invasion; and is
now a salesman for Billmore Motors in Miami. His associate,
RAMON, is an extremely dangerous individual and is described
as being a white Cuban male in his forties.
