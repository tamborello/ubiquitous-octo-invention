According to the source, [each one of these otticers AY)
told him that the KGB did not handlTé oswald after his redefection
to the United States, and the KGB did not give any tasks to

OSWALD. They also said that the KGB never gave OSWALD a task to
kill President Kennedy.

 

The source said that rumors in the West suggesting the
KGB was involved in KENNEDY's assassination were absurd.

According to the source, the KGB would never risk the scandal of
assassinating a major world leader.

DEBRIEFER'S COMMENTS: .

 

Needless to say, we will go back over his knowledge of
OSWALD in an effort to acquire any additional information.

wee The source discussed the Lee Harvey OSWALD case with
Gorner instructors att insk KGB Higher School of
ounterintelligence] u

Following his defection to the USSR, OSWALD was
resettled in Minsk, outside of Moscow. He was placed under full
surveillance by the regional or territorial KGB in Minsk. KGB
officers from the Second Directorate of the White Russian KGB
were in contact with Oswald and considered him an agent because
he would provide them with some information on his past.

Marina
was also considered an agent.

Oswald resided very close to Victory Square and the KGB

Higher School in Minsk. His apartment was very nice by Soviet
standards.

Oswald was also interrogated several: times by KGB
: officers in Moscow. The source does not know what type of’
information OSWALD provided to the KGB in Minsk or Moscow.

‘ His KGB handlers did consider passing OSWALD to the
" First Chief Directorate to be handled by a KGB residency in the
United States. This proposal was ultimately rejected, however,

because OSWALD was considered too unstable. According to the

source, the KGB did not handle OSWALD in the United States and
had no further contacts with him.

Marina was considered an agent, but she did not like to
cooperate with the KGB. She was interested in OSWALD, but even

more interested in getting away from the Soviet Union and
poverty.

Yuriy NOSENKO spent much of his career in the Sixth
Department of the KGB's Second Chief Directorate (SCD), which was
responsible for tourists. He spent only a short time of his
career in the First Department, SCD, which was responsible for
American officials at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

NOSENKO had excellent family connections because his
‘father was Minister for the Shipbuilding Industry in the USSR.
That is how NOSENKO managed to become a security officer for the
Soviet delegation which traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, for arms

control talks. He defected to the United States from this
position.

The SCD was quite pleased when U.S. intelligence began
to believe NOSENKO was not a bona fide defector. They were
particularly pleased when he was harshly interrogated by the CIA.

According to the source, NOSENKO was not sent to the
United States to be a false defector. The source said that it is
against KGB policy to send an intelligence officer as a false
defector. Also, the KGB would never have selected him for such a
a smission because his father is a high-level Party official.

The source doubts that NOSENKO ever saw OSWALD's file.
According to the source, NOSENKO was not higher than a Captain or .
Major when he defected to the United States. The source believes .
that NOSENKO may have tried to show himself more valuable to the
CIA than he really was. At the time of his defection, NOSENKO
was mixing in high circles of Moscow golden youth. The source
believes he defected for material gain. ,
