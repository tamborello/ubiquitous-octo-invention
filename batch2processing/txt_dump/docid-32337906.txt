refugee doctor of medicine, the reliability of whose

During the week in October, 1962 when President
KENNEDY announced the quarantine of Cuba, he, RAMOS,
was told by RAUL TORRES who is in charge of the_office
of the Revolutionary Council in New York City,[ that all
anti-CASTRO groups have now been given "the green light”
by CIA. Further, all groups, as long as they accept the
direction and guidance of CIA, will be free to recruit
and train for an eventual expedition to Cuba. | u)

 

Dr. RAMOS advised that he understood that this
was an unofficial agreement with the anti-CASTRO groum
Dr. RAMOS explained that by this he meant that the agree-
ment was an oral one and could not have official sanction,
He could furnish no further details,

Since the current relationship between CIA and
the anti-CASTRO groups is not known at Newark, it is being
left to the discretion and the office of origin whether
TORRES or CIA through 1 on should be contacted regarding
the above information, u a
