RE: RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON
.-105- 93072

gem

. A press telease of the FPCC dated. 9/24/62 indicated ‘that:
subject had left ‘the U. S, for a visit to Algeria and was also expected:
to visit. several. African countries. He apparently is visiting these

countries as a journalist. Y .

 

.On. 10/17/62 he: sent letter to Agent of our New York Office
| from Paris, France, in which he stated "chat ET can still-be of use to
“you, even from heré, if you think it worthwhile, The Conmittée could.
shut down within a few days without any serious: difficulties, expecially
now"that Lee has. learned he isn't going to get any money from our
friends in: the Caribbean, Oras I said before,(it could be preserved
and made harmless for use as a cover for an. information-gathering
agency." ee refers to Ted Lee, who is Security Index subject. and
who iS now acting as head-of FPCC, In making mention of the "Commi ttee"’
Gibson is. referring evidently. to the FPCC. y

: OBSERVATI ONS:

Data set forth in Gibson's letter and his present whereabouts
would be of interest|.to State and CIA._jIt is not felt that his letter
is of sufficient. importance ‘to ‘notify the Attorney General; _ however,
we should advise the Internal Security Division. Y CW

ACTION:

If you
