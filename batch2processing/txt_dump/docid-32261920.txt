Mr. G. Robert Blakey

Chief Counsel and Director

Select Committee on Assassinations
U. S. House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515

Dear Mr. Blakey:

Reference is made to your recent letter requesting information from the
Service records relating to Carlos Marcello; who was born in 1910 in
Tunis, and who was deported from the United States in April 1961. You
request information relating to any trips he may have made to Cuba during
the years 1958-1960.

Our Central Office indices disclose Mr. Marcello's file, A2 669 541, shows
he was born on February 6, 1910 and was admitted as an immigrant the same
year.

Based on a telephonic request from Mr. J. Facter of your office, Mr. Marcello's
Social Security Number, 434-20-6189, was furnished Mr. Facter on December 20,
1977..

At the same time Mr. Facter was advised of a telephone conversation between
Mr. William J. Honan of this staff and Mr. Troy Adams, District Director of
the New Orleans office on December 19, 1977.. He stated the file is contained
in better than two drawers of a file cabinet. Mr. Adams states he does not
have the personnel available to go through Mr. Mareello's file to see if

the information requested is in his file. He suggested that a member of your
.staff£ go to the New Orleans: office and they would make the file available and
would be willing to xerox any copies of the file material you would desire.

Mr. Facter was further advised that Investigator T. Papalos of the New Orleans
office, who has extensive knowledge concerning Mr. Marcello would be avail-
able until December 31, 1977, ashe is retiring on that date.

In view of your interest and the proximity of your deadline of December 23,
1977 for this information, I regret I am unable to give you a more favorable
reply.

Sincerely,

Frases a8 hy Gall :
