CO Q :
PAGE THREE OO / a 7
WT OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED OR DISTURBED OVER DEATH OF GIANCANA
WHICH WOULD LOGICALLY RULE OUT THEORY THAT GLANCANA COULD
HAVE BERN KILLED BY "YOUNG TURKS” CAUSING M08 UNREST AND
UPHEAVAL. U

ALSO, CG 7016-CTE, WHOSE IDENTITY AS UPPER ECHELON
L@ADER IN ORGANIZED CRIME 1S KNOWN TO BUREAU, WAS ENCOUNTERED
DURING BRIEF CHANCE MEETING ON JUNE 26, 1975, AND HE COMMENTED
THaT REGENT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE (JACK MABLEY) WHICH LINKED GIANCANA'S
DEATH TO POWER PLAY BY YOUNG HOODS WaS INCURRECT. HE ALSO STATED
WITHOUT EMBELLISHMENT THAT "IF YOU KNEW THE TRUTH YOU WOULDN'T

 

BELIEVE 11" WHICH IMPLIES UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING
GIANCANA'S DEATH. UL | LL
| LT THEREFORE aPPEARS aT THIS TIME, BASED ON AVAILABLE
WFO AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT GLANCANA'S DEATH ELTHER HAD THE
APPRUVAL OF CURRENT “0B LEADERSHIP, THE REASONS FOR WHICH HAVE U

NOT YET BECOME APPARENT. OR IT WAS POSSIBLY A CRIME OF PASSION
