CONSIDERATIONS

Possible future use in communications and support,

Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose
of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions
controlling these factors, If the recruitment and train-
ing are for resistance activities, ‘the task of reeruit-
ment and training will be much less difficult than if
they are limited to intelligence -collection purposes

only.

There are "colonies"! in Washington, D.C., and other
U.S. cities which are "little Cuhas," Family, Church,
and business interests provoke unusual personal ties
inside Cuba for some of these residents: a real potential
exists for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail-
able. (FBI support and coordination is basic in this

effort.)

As Opa-Locka becomes fully activated, CLA will activate
other interrogation centers 2 ptly as feasible. A
center is being activated in ffegotiations with
local authorities are being undertaken to i centers,
if possible, inj San
Juan, Puerto are being sur-
veyed for possible Cénters, (CIA responsibility with sup-
port by others as necessary.)

is adequate for this training, but that such training of covert agents ;
who will be introduced ultimately into Cuba represents a security problem
anda departure from past security procedures, due to the fact that U.S.
Government sponsorship will be apparent to trainees. Capture and
interrogation of any of these covert agents could result in exposure
(in international news media) of U.S. official involvement in efforts to
unseat the present Communist Cuban regime. A policy determination
is needed as to whether or not agents to be infiltrated into Cuba should
be trained on U.S. Government installations.

   

There are other U.S. military installations and properties, in
the Southeastern U.S. and Caribbean areas, which CIA would like to use
for similar training and operational purposes in the future. The same

CONSIDERATIONS

This operation, in response to early recommendation

as essential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at
utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with
anew building completed and occupied, anc witha

staff of 43 at work. Operations commenced 15 February -
and, as of ? March, 33 people were active at the Center,
{CLA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,
State, USIA.) ,

As the cperations develop, there will be both increased
intelligence collection and a need for as current an In-
telligence Estimate as the U.S. can produce meaningfully,
it is hkely that a more informal method of producing an
Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level {than
now governing the issuance of NIE's) may have to be
followed. CIA is now publishing daily intelligence sum-
maries on Cuba and is planning a bi-monthly or weekly
report summing up intelligence for this purpose, (CIA

Prime targets for hit-and-run teams based
outside Cuba are CMQ TV and the Czech radio
transmitter (believed now used to jam U.S,
broadcasts). Attacks mounted only when
operationally feasible. The G-2 micro-wave
net should be dealt with when there are suf-
ficient assets inside to make sabotage coincide

This should be a concerted attack, as feasible
in July-August, on power plants at Havana, °

requiring detailed planning and special equip-
ment, and can be mounted from outside Cuba,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Ay

we

From: Brig. Gen, Lansdale qh

Noting that you will be away from the country most of the |
month of February, there are some matters vital to our Project
for which we should provide. Certain proposals should have
evidence of your support. Some strong decisions may have to
be made if our Project is to win its goal -- and the bureaucratic
machine has too many people captive to it, one way or another.

It is my hope that you will make someone specifically
responsible to speak for your determined course and have the
role of being your "presence''as far as possible, This demands
a personal conviction, freedom from bureaucratic instincts, and

 

reasonably direct access to the President. Perhaps Dick Good- |
win could fulfill this role. Secretary McNamara is an alternate pie
suggestion; he has so many irons in the fire that I hesitated men- Be &

tioning him. You might be considering General Taylor, but I do
not believe he can quite play this role; he is still too much a fine
military bureaucrat at heart,

As you know, I remain convinced that our goal can be won,
Perhaps, if we can keep forcing U.S. agencies to work hard at
it, the goal can be won through their efforts. Yet, their efforts
haven't been impressive to date, and I still feel that we might
uncork the touchdown play independently of the institutional pro-
gram we are spurring.

It may be a special effort which professional labor operators
can launch to stir up workers in Latin America and Cuba, It may
be through ethnic-language groups as an untapped action
potential, It could be a warming-up‘of the always lively youth
element in Latin America and Cuba, through some contacts specially
used. It could be with the ere through the Church, with families

Chief of Operations , ‘ 18 January 1962
CIAHAS NO OBJECTION TO THE CUBA PROJECT .
DECLASSIFICATION ANO/OR RS
RELEASE OF THIS DOCUMENT I, OBJECTIVE NS
AS SAI a
ice dy The U.S. objective is to help the Cubans overthraw the Communist
1S ‘regime from within Cuba and institute a new government with which the
\ otUnited States can live in peace.

3
ae? Il. CONCEPT OF OPERATION

ww °
\ 3 , ‘ rae Basically, the operation is to bring about the revolt of the Cuban
(A . people. The revolt will overthrow the Communist regime and institute
a new government with which the United States can live in peace.

The revolt requires a strongly motivated political action movement
established within Cuba, to generate the revolt, to give it direction to-
wards the objective, and to capitalize on the climactic moment. The
political actions will be assisted by economic warfare to induce failure
of the Communist regime to supply Cuba's economic needs, psychological
operations to turn the peoples’ resentment increasingly against the regime,
and military-type groups to give the popular movement an action arm for

@ sabotage and armed resistance in support of political objectives.

The failure of the U.S. -sponsored operation in April 1961 so shook
the faith of Cuban patriots in U.S. competence and intentions in support-
ing a revolt against Castro that a new effort to generate a revolt against
the regime in Cuba must have active support from key Latin American
countries. Further, the foreigness {Soviet Union and Bloc) of the tyranny
imposed on the Cuban people must be made clear to the people of the
Western Hemisphere to the point of their deep anger and open actions to
defend the Western Hemisphere against such foreign invasion. Such an
anger will be generated, in part, by appeals from the popular movement
within Cuba to other Latin Americans especially.

y The preparation phase must result in a political action organization

in being in key localities inside Cuba, with its own means for internal :

communications, its own voice for psychological operations, and its own

action arm (small guerrilla bands, sabotage squads, etc.). It must have

the sympathetic support of the majority of the Cuban people, and make this
~ fact known to the outside world. (it is reported that the majority of Cubane

are not for the present regime, but are growing apathetic towards what

appears to be a hopeless future or the futility of their status.)

The climactic moment of revolt will come from an angry reaction of
the people to a government action (sparked by an incident), or froma
fracturing of the leadership cadre within the regime, or both, (A major —

goal of the Project must be to bring this about.) The popular movemer. st

of pre-emptive action with respect to tanker charters (most Bloc ship-
ments to Cuba are carried in Western bottoms), CIA has initiated
action to contaminate POL supplies for Cuba, although visible results

 

  

_ CIA expects to be able
to have at least one agent recruited by 28 February to attempt introduc-
tion of a corrosive additive to jet fuel storage tanks in Cuba.

J. Military actions

Status: Defense has been tasked with preparing a contingency plan
for U.S. military action, in case the Cuban people request U.S, help
when their revolt starts making headway. This contingency plan will
permit obtaining a policy decision on the major point of U.S. intentions,
and is looked upon as a positive political-psychological factor ina

@ people's revolt, even more than as a possible military action, Defense
also has been tasked with fully assisting State and CIA, as commitments
of Defense men, money, and materiel are required.

K.- Major elements of the population

   
 
 
 
  

nd: CIA are continuing to explore their capabilities
‘ative to date) for mounting special group operations
on dynamic elements of the population, particularly
operations through Church to reach the women and families, and
through Labor contacts to reach the workers, Other elements include
enlistment of. the youth and professional groupings, Special consideration
is to be given to doing this through Latin-American operational contacts, ~
This is vital to the success of our political action nucleus when CIA can

put it into place, : :

  
 

Ne L. Outlook

Status: As reported to the Special Group last week, there has been a
period of a realistic second look at CIA capabilities to mount the required
clandestine operations against Cuba, and a subsequent start in "tooling up.”
After this second look, CIA has concluded that its realistic role should be
to create at least the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support
for it, to improve CIA operational capability, and to help create a climate
which will permit provocative actions in support of a shift to overt action.

. ' This outlook, although arrived at thoughtfully within CIA, is far short of
the Cuba project's goals. CLA must take yet another hard look at its
potential capabilities, in the light of the following tasking, to determine
if it cannot make the greater effort required. .
