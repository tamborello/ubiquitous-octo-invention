RE: DOMINIC MOIO (deceased) Suspect and
Girlfriend ANGELINE CONSTANTINO

Ld PCL, advised ANGELINE CONSTANTINO, former
girlfrien ; visited him recently at the store on two
£ occasions. On one of these occasions, he was about to tell him
something regarding BILLY NAPLES, but she was interrupted by a

a advised that CONSTANTINO had told him that she believed the
NAPLES brothers were responsible for MOIO's death, and she
warned MOIO prior to his death to stay away from the NAPLES, PCI
stated she never explained to him why she was so afraid of the
NAPLES,

As to how he met MOIO, PCI stated he had first met
MOIO at the Gaytimes Tavern operated by CONSTANTINO. After seeing
him several times. there, he struck up a conversation with him and
learned he was from Canton and was in Youngstown doing plaster
work, He then introduced MOIO to CONSTANTINO and he feels
certain they had not known @ach other previously. He said within
a few days MOIO was behind the bard the Gaytimes.

PCI stated later he learned MOIO was very friendly
with NAPLES (BILLY), but never learned the circumstances under
which they met or why they became so friendly.

PCI advised he recently met LQU TORMA (ph) real name
LOUIS, LAPORIS, who is employed by the NAPLES brothers in the as
United Music Company, who came to his store to buy electronics

VINCE DE NIRO (bombed to death 7/17/61) had paid a sum of money
to DOMINIC MOIO (deceased) to avenge the death of her son. Source
stated that MIKE told him that MOIO came to Mra DE NIRO with the
proposition. . Source stated that in this particular instance, in
his opinion MOIO was simply being an opportunist since he had
probably already received the contract from the "Clevelatid
syndicate", to avenge DE NIRO's death. Source stated that
subsequently MOIO did actively participate in the bombing-death
of BILLY NAPLES (7/1/62), whom the syndicate felt was responsible
for the bombing death of VINCE DE NIRO, i
