SUBJECT: Interview with Colonel J. C. King

On Wednesday, April 30, 1975 I interviewed Colonel J. Cc. King
at the Commission offices at 712 Jackson Place. Colonel King.
served as Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division during the
1960-61 period with which I was concerned. He is now retired:
and'living in the Washington suburbs. He stated that his
neighbors doi not know of his background with the Central
Intelligence Agency and that he prefers to maintain his cover.
We agreed not to refer to him-by name.

Colonel King's recollection of the events surrounding the death
~ : of Generali gho Trujillo was very vague. King recalled.having met
with Trujillo and with his Chief of Intelligence, Johnny Abbes,
: with the approval of the American Ambassador in order to: “éStablish
“lfaliisoniwithé “that’sérvice. He described this meeting as very
friendly.

Colonel King stated he remembered some talk on the subject of
weapons, but he never saw any weapons and does not recall any
weapons being sent to the Dominican Republic. He commented in
response to my statement of facts that three pistols did not
represent very much and stated he did recall CIA objéttives to
know what the internal opposition was doing.

Colonel King had no recollection of the meeting at which Assistant
Secretary Rubottom allegedly authorized the provision of sniper
rifles. He stated, however, that he had the closest relationship
with Mr. Rubttom and met him almost daily. Colonel King recalled
no flap with the State Department about the provision of weapons
following Generalismo Trujillo's death.

After the discussion concerning events in the Dominican Republic

I left the interview room and Mr. Belin discussed with Colonel King
some of the events surrounding the alleged attempts on the life

of Fidel Castro. As I was not present for this portion of the
interview, .I have not described what was said at that time.
