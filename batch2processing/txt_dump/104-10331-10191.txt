‘SUBJECT: GyRe: The IRO's ARRB Declarations

Fred, Yes, these are two distinct actions. The option for the Board was that they would receive detailed declarations from each of the
DDs to the-Board or there would have to be internal declarations that would support the declaration before the EXDIR or GC could sign
for the agency. . The decision was to go with internal declarations and the Agency declaration will specifically say that certifications
have been made by each of the directorates. And that means that the DO will have to do one which looks something like the sample we
gave you. We need te get together soonest to determine how it can be done in time (early part of next week). Jim 0.

i guess I'ma hittle confused in that the example fooks more like the directorate certification that needs to be done prior to the Agency. |
thought you were focused only on the EB being sent electronically. On the assumption the a memo will be acceptable for stating the EB
was distributed | have started in that direction.

SUBJECT: ©) Re: The IRO's ARRB Declarations
Fred, This is a followup to my LN of Friday. Please refer to D/OIM's memo to the DDs of 12 August (OIM 98-0089).
T have talked to Barry and we agree that the most important steps needed for the DO certification are as follows:

vA Your own title and duties, and your experience,
2. A detailed description of the searches which have been undertaken in ail parts of the DO since 1993 on behalf of the Board.. (if you

_ have any insight as to how the searches at the time of the Warren Commission and the Church Commission were done -which led to

Assassination related documents-this would also be helpful)
3. A description of 00 Briefings provided to ARRB staffers.

if we can get the above information, Eileen W. and Gary 8. can put together a package which includes the individual responses provided to
the Board. .

it is critical that we get on this soonest. We need a final product by WEDNESDAY and, as you can see, this is a big job.

Thanks for your help. Jim 0.
