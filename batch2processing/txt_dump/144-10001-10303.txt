“Most Immediate

(2-part message complete]

A religious service in memory: of President KENNEDY was held
yesterday afternoon in the church in Accra; A particularly large
crowd, mostly Africans, literally; overflowed the Porticoces.
Contrary to the practice of Presidént NKRUMAH, who never
participates in religious ceremonies, several members of the
government and the President of. ‘the Supreme Court of Justice were
present. Except for the Cuban’ ‘and Chinese ambassadors, ; the chiefs
of the diplomatic missions were in attendance,

-President NKRUMAH broddcast a: ‘message to the nation exalting
the personality of the late President "who will be extolled in the
annals of humanity for his action against racism and his efforts
in favor of peace and human rights. " ‘

President DE GAULLE' s act of attending the funeral in person
and the wording of his two messages to Mrs. KENNEDY and to the
new President of, the United’ States impressed many of my colleagues
and members of the government , who praised the human and political

aspects of our’ ‘President! S attitude,
