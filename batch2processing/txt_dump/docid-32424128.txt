Comment

This course of action should only be.undertaken if a OC |
US policy decision to.do away with Castro. by all means short of

UNILATERAL ACTION B
CIA View

CIA will recommend complete relaxation of present policy

_ banning all independent Cuban exile maritime raids and air ‘strikes

against targets:in Cuba from US and urge the British to do likewise
for Bahama territory.

Comment

State course of action is preferable, Only selected reliable
exile groups should be utilized for this purpose. The British would
likely recoil from CIA proposal, Exile air attacks should not. be
authorized. ;
