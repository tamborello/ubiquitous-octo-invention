The Bureau's attention was called to New York letter,
10/29/62, where the NYO advised that a letter was anonymously
mailed by the NYO to MARVIN MARKMAN on 10/25/62, which pointed
out to MARKMAN substantially what MARKMAN is now complaining -
about. The NYO believes that its letter set the seeds of thought
in MARKMAN's mind and these. thoughts have now come out into
open dissatisfaction on: ‘the part» of MARKMAN.

said that’ invitations are sent to people out of town, even thoug
‘it is known that they will not attend, but they do send in a
contribution. . ; :

From the NYO's knowledge of past events, the NYO believes
that NY pl would be in the position to discreetly frustrate
_L'unita's pts to make money out of this affair. Ny [212 oa
has advised that he mails a great part of the invitations by
himself. The NYO believes that if the invitations to persons out
of town were never mailed, that source or income would be cut off
If they do not receive the invitation, the.persons would never
know that they had been invited. He will also fail to mail 4
invitations to persons who are not very active throughout the ye4r,
again cutting. down the contributions and attendance at the affair.:

“ At recent meetings of the Nat Richman Club of the
Bronx, CP, attempts were made by club leaders to discuss Viet Nam,
Cyprus, Africa and the Soviet-Chinese dispute.

 

At that last club meeting, the informant made a strong
protest that such discussions were a waste of time since the
club could do little about such problems. He pointed out that
there are many local problems right in Bronx County which the
club members could help solve, problems such as otser mination, Ay
housing, education, etc., which deserve immediate attention.

 

The informant's remarks caused considerable argument ;
and confusion, resulting in complete: disruption of the meeting.<
