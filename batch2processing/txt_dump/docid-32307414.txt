ADMINISTRATIVE

Interstate'Transportation of Stolen Motor
Vehicle. aspects of this case are being handled in the
Miami case titled "ROBERT PAUL CURTIS; ITSMV", Miami ‘

- file 26-34692, Bureau file 26-407068.

Referenced report dated January 6, 1969,
contained, beginning on page 58, an interview with CHERYL
SCHLECKER, in which that individual described how she and
subject MAX GONZALEZ traveled to Mexico in August, 1968,
with RAY and LYNN BANNISTER, in 1968 Chevrolets. RAY
BANNISTER was later identified by MM 1312-C as RAY BRUCE.
Subsequently, Miami investigation disclosed that the true
name of RAY BRUCE is LOMEN RAY BRUCE, whose wife is CARRIE
LYNN BRUCE. CARRIE LYNN BRUCE, also known as LYNN BRUCE
and LYNN BANNISTER, was located and interviewed on March 18,
1969, results of which interview are set out in instant
report.

LOMEN RAY BRUCE was interviewed on March 24, 1969,
results of which are set out in details, and was ostensibly
cooperative. However, his version of the trip to Mexico
differed in several basic aspects from the story given by
his wife. It is believed that BRUCE has more information

regarding the cars driven into Mexico by himself and GONZALEZ,

and more knowledge regarding FIORINI's plans for subject
organization prior to onset of actual operation, than he
divulged during interview. Re-interview of BRUCE will be
considered should Legat, Mexico City investigation produce

information warranting this. The BRUCEs evidently returned to

the U.S., singly or together, without participating in the
Mexico phase of the IACB operation, except that the car they

drove into Mexico was probably a rental car disposed of in the
same manner as other rental cars previously mentioned in this case.

matter, is currently a racial source of the Miami Office

River County Sheriff's Office, Vero Beach, advised SA
DAVID C. CALLAN that he had received no reports of any
stolen or misappropriated rental cars during August and
September, 1968.

Regarding Departmental request for further

| investigation in this matter, per referenced Bureau airtel,

| it is feit. that re-interviews of CURTIS and MANNING have
resolved as much as possible discrepancies in their
previous descriptions of transported weapons. BROWN

transported to Mexico by MANNING and/or CURTIS.

As indicated in details interviews, there are no

U.S. Government records which wouldorroborate the ‘
travel of FIORINI or any members of his group from the

imited States to Mexico. A U.S. citizen is not required

‘te register with any U.S. Government agency prior to

crossing into Mexico. On nis return. trip he must make out .
S. Customs baggage deciaration slip if he has any
1andise to declare, but no permanent record is otherwise
maintained of his re-entry.
