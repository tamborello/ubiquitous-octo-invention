Memorandum Branigan to Sullivan
Re: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
62~109060

 

DETAILS: |

' Mr. Merriman Smith, senior White House correspondent,
reported Garrison alleges David William Ferrie was associated
with a group of anti-Castro Cubans which trained at Lake
Pontchartrain, Louisiana, during the period 1961-1962. ¥0n OR
February 23, 1961, CIA confidentially informed this Bureau
that in connection with a sensitive CIA project directed
against Cuba, one phase of which involved the training of
an exiles, CIA would initiate a training operation at
amp Belle Chase, located a short distance south of New Orleans ,
Lake Pontchartrain. CIA advised that this camp had been
a deactivated Naval base but would be reopened by CIA under a :
Department of Army cover. CIA further advised it would be
training from 15 to 40 Cubans at a time for a period of about
five weeks. We, of course, did nvestigate CIA's activities i
at Camp Belle Chase, Louisiana, andfour files contain no GA
h

information that & a Ferrie had any connectio i

this CIA operation. ‘ \
: In July, 1963, we received information from several i

sources that a number of Cuban refugees had come lew Orleans ‘

from Miami, Florida, through the efforts of Rudolph Davis, Fla LY

reportedly to attend a training camp after which t would be

sent to-a training camp in Guatemala. Sources’ reported this

group became disenchanted and returned to Miami shortly after
; their arrival. : .

We interviewed Rudolph Davis in this matter and he
indicated he acted as a coordinatorbetween, the Movimiento |
Democratica.Cristiano_(MDC), an anti-Castro organization, and __
the New York City Police Department in 1961 and that he was the
delegate for this” anti-Castro organization in New Orleans. He
stated he came to New Orleans in August, 1961, and in early
1963 made friends with persons in the lumber business in
Guatemala with whom he formed the Guatemalan Lumber and Mineral
Corporation. Davis said he brought approximately 19 men to
New Orleans to train for lumber cutting work in Guatemala. He
added that when the men learned they were to work in a lumber
industry and were not recruited for military operations against
Cuba, they became disenchanted and returned to Miami, Our
files contain no information indicating that David William
Ferrie or Lee Harvey Oswald had any contact or connection with
Davis or the anti-Castro organization which Davis represented.
