‘<pase of the informations received from USA, must be ¢
an undesirable foreigner. Therefore, a respective intensaat
entry was pronounced against ALEX on February 3, 1965 fous

to ALEX on his return to Chicago (letter of Chicago Pakiceidaced

' March 16, 1965). Subsequently, ALEX appealed against Ine, Giselase oe

interdiction of entry, pretending that the banished pgmsoniiwgs ONE

identical with him. - :
On the base of the examination of hotel note copies

and the photographs mentioned above, the Swiss Fede
dealing with Foreigners comes to the assumption that

who was the subject of your requests and the interdic onson entry

into Switzerland may be two different persons. Due to these facts,
ALEX will be allowed to enter Switzerland on a further visit at
the end of this year. ‘

Therefore, we ask you to kindly let have made a new check in your
country, on the base and by comparison the documents sent by you
(photograph and fingerprints) and the pieces sent by us (copies of
- hotel notes, copy of passport with photograph and photographs
taken in Zurich and. Pontresina) in order to establish whether we
are in front of two different persons named ALEX Gus, forwarding '
us the results of this enquiry at your earliest convenience. :

Very truly yours,
