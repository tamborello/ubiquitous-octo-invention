Pope was added to the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list La ,

on August 11, 1959. An informant of the Oklahoma City Office has
indicated she is a close friend of Pegsy Fry, 2 paramour of Pope.

The following information has peen furnished by ASAC R. J.
Baker of the Dallas Office concerning current developments.

The informant has peen in touch with Peggy Fry. Fry is

peen trustworthy so far.

ed
The informant is supposed to go to Dallas as.Fry has
indicated a need for an automobile. Fry has advised the. informant that
she and her friend (it is presumed this is Pope 45 he apparently. ‘has
peen with per) who has stomach trouble, need a car to go-about 1200
miles. She asked that the informant meet her Friday in Dallas.

Arrangements have been made for the informant to either
use her own car or use her sister's car which is a Ford, 1957 model.
The informant will go to Dallas a day early as the Dallas office desires.
to put a transmitter in the car in order to facilitate any surveillance
which might arise.

The Dallas Office states that a Laboratory expert is in
Dallas at this time; that it is feasible .to put such a transmitter in the

car. It can be done if sufficient tigtie ‘ie given; anywhere from:six to
eight hours. ak ' yf .

Memorandum to the Director

Baker recommends that this be done as. it would be very
difficult to follow the informant. He bases this conclusion on the
presumption that the informant will be contacted by Fry who is to goto
Fry's. sister's house jn Dallas. There the informant will be contacted
and it is. presumed will be taken to the point where the fugitive may be
residing or hiding out. A surveillance, if made, will immediately put
the informant’ s. life in jeopardy. It will also result in our efforts
being immediately disclosed and, of course, this would be undesirable.

Baker states the informant can get to Dallas on Thur sday
and make the car available. We will have control over it but of course.
she would immediately suspect that something was being done to the
car if the car is turned over to the Bureau. She, of course, will not
know nor will she be able to observe the installation. Inasmuch as we
are trusting the informant up to this point, we apparently have nothing
to lose by allowing this installation to pe made. Itis petween losing. the
fugitive on the one hand and creating some suspicion on the part of the
informant that something was done to her car. I believe the latter is
preferable.

RECOMMENDATION
The installation is being approved and it is suggested that
the Laboratory may wish to get in touch with the Dallas Office

immediately to work out the necessary arrangements in order to -
effectuate the above.
