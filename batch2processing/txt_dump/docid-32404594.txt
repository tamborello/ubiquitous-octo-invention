Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for
Additional Information and Records

 

Dear John:

Tam writing to follow-up on our ‘telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board’s requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered.— including some that were made more thantwo
years ago. On many occasions we have beervassured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct —
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the

, highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the .
following points differs from.ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

 

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files; CLA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

“*CIA-IR-22 “A” File on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison. .

In July 1997, the ARRB staff-was shown an “A” file on Clay Shaw which pre-
dated a 201 file. We were also told that an “A” file on Jim Garrison also existed.
The Shaw file was declared to be an assassination record and it was our
understanding that both files were to be sent to HRG for processing. We have
not yet received confirmation from HRG that the files are in process as __
assassination records.

CIA-IR-23 Watch Committee Files.

In his memoirs, George Ball reports that upon first hearing of the shots in Dallas
he called DCI John McCone and asked him to activate the Watch Committee.
McCone replied that he already had. The Review Board requests the files of the
-Watch Committee for the period January 1963-May 1964.

CIA-IR-24 Defector File.

The ARRB staff has identified documents on Lee Harvey Oswald from the Office
of Security’s “Defector File.” It is our understanding that these documents are
now being processed as assassination records. No further tasking on this subject
is anticipated.

CIA-IR-25 Zapruder Film.

The Board has requested any and all records, not previously located in the
Sequestered Collection, on any handling by-the CIA of the Zapruder film. In
particular, we are interested in any records of NPIC’s handling of the Zapruder |
film or copies of the Zapruder film in November and December 1963. Any log
books or indexes which would indicate the individuals involved in the
processing and handling of any assassination films should be included in this
request. .

CIA-IR-26 Jordan James-Pfuntner.

HW 53217

The Review Board requested that a complete search for any records on this
individual be undertaken, including a search of the Interagency Source Register
The ARRB staff provided HRG with additional identification data on this
individual. The Review Board seeks a full and accurate formal response to this

Subject: CIA IR 22 -- “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim:
. Garrison . : .

Copies of the A files on Shaw and Garrison have been
received in HRG. They are available for your review at your
convenience (see. attached envelopes). It.is my ;
understanding that both files have been declared
Assassination Records (AR) by the ARRB. The current plan is
to incorporate the copies (not originals) of these two files
into the JFK Collection. The files will be processed in
late Spring along with other new ARs.

This should complete our action on this request for the
