Government. With this in mind, he attempted, through friends,
to place PEDRO DIAZ LANZ in contact with first, the State
Department, and later CIA, The individual he spoke to at

the State Department, one WILLIAM !WIELAND, made a flat
refusal to see DIAZ LANZ. PIERROT's contact at CIA showed a
definite lack of interest in DIAZ LANZ. PIERROT is unaware
of whether DIAZ LANZ was (ultimately contacted by CIA on this
occasion,

 

Also, in regard to the financial needs of PEDRO
DIAZ LANZ, PIERROT. noted that he has pointed out to his
superiors their company's past profitable dealings with PEDRO
DIAZ LANZ in his former capacity as a representative of the
Cuban government, PIERROT recommended that PEDRO DIAZ LANZ
be given a job by the Bell Aircraft Corporation at a nominal
salary of about $300 a month, pointing out that the day could
conceivably arrive when Bell Aircraft would again be dealing
with PEDRO DIAZ LANZ in the sale of their aircraft, PIERROT
advised, however, that he did not have much hope for the
adoption of his recommendation,

In regard to the 10-page document mentioned in
the enclosed letterhead memorandum, WFO will maintain both
it and the letter of MARCOS DIAZ LANZ in their files. If
Miami has not already received a copy, it is felt that that
office can secure a copy from PEDRO DIAZ LANZ.
