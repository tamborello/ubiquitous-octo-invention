Attached is a letter, sent to the Embassy, a rough translation of
which follows:

am _
"The ‘dangerous' organizations:

“Have you thought that our world is a great community of organi-
zations, There are a great number of idealistic organizations, there are
professional organizations, there are political organizations, there are .
organizations within the business world, etc. Practically everyone in our
world now belongs to one or several organizations. And the organizations
have significant power in our world = one can well call them a third power
in our world.

  
 
     
   
  
     
      
      
   
   
 
    

"What I want to show you, with the enclosed picture,-is the clenched
right hand, upright, slightly leaning toward the shoulder, the thumb at an
angle over the fingers. It requires training, for tha membar, to execute
this organization's sign. :

      
   
    
 

"T have seen this sign made, but I can not recall where, as well
as writing paper with this emblem.

   
  

"He wants to show with this sign, all is ‘glear (comments: could
be translated: the job is finished), but help me now.

  
     
 

"(If) You can get hold of this organization, which has this sign,
you have come to the solution to that terrible crime, ‘which happened in
November 1963, in your part of the world. ;

    
   
     

"I have traveled much, you can certainly searoh out this organi
zation in our world, I wish you great success and sign .

 
 
 
 

Wenstrén (Signature)}"

2. (The Station files contained one card with the name Johan Artur
WENNSTROM and the ne information that he was sentenced to 10 months imprison=
ment for espionage in Sweden. Unfortunately the material to which this’
card referred has been destroyed, From the 1964 telephone directory for

N¥esj5, from which the letter was sent, there are the following listings:

(ihe Station has no traces on WENCO-WENETA HANDELSBOIAG. The ‘company, is not
listed in the 1963-64 edition of the Svenska Aktiebolag. The 1964 Na iss jb
