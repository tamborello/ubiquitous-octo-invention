Chestone stated at: no time was Merita an "operative" for the F.B.I. as she had
stated, nor was she a source or an informant.

During the time Chestone knew Lou and Merita, she never once mentioned

Lee Harvey Oswald, although in 1976, after Chestone had retired, Merita called him
and asked if he remembered receiving a photograph from her wherein Oswald
appeared. Chestone told her she was mistaken, then inquired as-to what she was
referring to concerngng Oswald.

Chestone believes Merita to be a sweet but pathetic person, seeking to enlarge her
role in life by constantly seeking publicity. He also characterizes her a

person given to fantasy and lies.

Chestone recalls Merita leaf her husband Lou and moved into an apartment with
Peno Fagiane, a mob hit man or enforcer. Chestone believes this is the only real
conatct Merita has ever had with anyone remotely connected with organized crime
contrary:to her statments over the years. -

Merita mentioned also having worked with John Cotter as an FBI informer.
Chestone explained that Cotter took over when Chestoné retired and used
Yvarsits as his contact for watching the Soviets at the Newberry building.
Chestone feels that Cotter was well aware of the immagination of Merita and would not
have used her in any capacity.

With respect to Merita's allegation concerning her work with the CIA,

Chestone believes this would have come up on a background check made

when he was using Yvarsits-as an informer; it did not appear.Merita was connected.

With regard to JFK exhibit #124, a letter of thanks from the FBI to Merita,
Mrs. Louis Yvarsits, Chestone explained this was meant for Lou, but he requested
it be sent to Merita to make her feel she was part of the patriotic duties

”

performed by her husband.

In summary Chestone feels Merita has completely exaggerated her role with the
AW 5052%p Doghd: 32248883 i age nit being truthful about the .¥% se” Oswald photograph.
