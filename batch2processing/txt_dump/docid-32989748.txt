HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

On December 6, 1977, Special Agent (SA) Stephen
M. Callender of the New Orleans Office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was interviewed by

_ Peter G. Beeson, Mark A. Speiser, and Lisa Berlow, Staff

Counsel of the HSCA.

The questioning related to the investigation
conductéd by the New Orleans Office of the FBI régarding the

‘assassination of Martin Luther King.

In response to their initial questions ; they were
informed that SA Callender has been a Special Agent of the
FBI since August, 1951 and that he has been assigned to the
New Orleans FBI Office since December, 1961. SA Callender
was. assigned a case involving the assassination of Martin
Luther King-within the Néw Orleans PBI Office. His main

- duties as case agent were the handling of ‘the "paper"

involving the investigation. This included reading and
veviewing all incoming and outgoing communications,

assisted in assigning of leads., review all investigation
conducted to be suré that it was complete and thorough.
Joseph T. Sylvester, dr., in April, 1968, was the Assistant
Agent in Charge of the New Orleans Office of the FBI and was
overall in charge of the investigation conducted by New
Orleans. SA Callender probably was assigned the case by

Mr. Sylvester, inasmuch as SA Callender was working on

‘Mr. Sylvester's squad. This squad, among other things,

handled Civil Rights and related matters, SA Callender had
worked for Sylvester for better than six years and had experience
in the handling of "paper" on other major investigations;

NOTE: The HSCA's reauests were included in a letter to the
Attorney General from G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and
Director, HSCA, on 12/13/77. It is believed the HSCA is
considering interview of some agents involved in COINTELPRO
activities against King and SCLC and in the MURKIN
investigation. The ESCA has requested expeditious handling
of its King related requests and, therefore, a Bureau
deadline in this matter is being established.

Counterintellipence efforts against King and SCLC
were carried out in the substantive investigative files as
well as under the COINTEL Program. Therefore, the field is
being reauired to provide case agents in all of these
matters.
