Mr. David G.: Marwell

Question (3)

Approximately 18 linear feet of employee working files
which are potentially responsive to the JFK Act have been
located. However, the material in these boxes appears to be
duplicative of that found in the sequestered files.

Sincerely,

‘Mr. David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Assassination Records
Review Board

600 E Street, NW

Washington, DC 20530

Dear David:
This is in response to your letter of December 15, 1995,

in which you asked for a status report on CIA's Review of JFK
Records. The following is keyed to the questions in your

letter.
Question (1)

The CIA's JFK assassination records consist primarily of
documents sequestered by the House Select Committee on :
Assassinations at the conclusion of its investigation. This
material consists of approximately 320,000 pages. There are
no publicly available lists or indices of these records.

Question (2)

Approximately 227,000 pages of the JFK records have been
processed and released to the National Archives. Currently,
we are conducting a second review of this material. We
expect this effort to result in a significant increase in the
number of documents being released in full.

Unprocessed records include about 30,000 pages of a
microfilm version of the Oswald 201 file, approximately —
11,000 pages of Office of Personnel files, and over 43,000
pages of material not related to the JFK assassination. The
bulk of the remaining material consists of third agency
documents. The time required to complete the processing
will depend on the outcome of discussions with the Board.
