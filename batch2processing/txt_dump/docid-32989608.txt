The Honorable J. Edgar Hoover

Director, Federal Bureau of
~~ Investigation :
| Washington, D.C. 20530 re

Dear Mr. Hoover: . €

I sincerély enjoyed my conversation with you on
Wednesday and wish to thank you for so generously
giving me your time.

 

I have not contacted any of the departments and
agencies whose cooperation we hope to enlist in
connection with the government-wide intelligence
unit other Uhai your Bureau and the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. I think it would be helpful to have
your designee or designees named before making any
further contacts in order to have available your
advice with respect to which departments and agencies
should be included as well as those you deem unneces-
sary to include at this time. . \

|
|

In view of the fact that preliminarily, at least,
all we wish to do is discuss the subject very generally
jor the purpose of assessing realistically the nature
and structure of the intelligence unit which we hope
to achieve, I am of the present opinion that the size
of the initial group should be somewhat limited. I
would.be-grateful .for .your thoughts,on this aspect of. .,
oi he problem as well | as the substantive matters to be
