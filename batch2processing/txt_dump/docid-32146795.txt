RE: LEE HARVEY OSWALD ,

sos-e2889 CONFIDENTIAL

introductory statement coincides with aforementioned statement of
the Commission and is designed to emphasize the liaison capacity of
U. S. representatives in Mexico. You will note that the Bureau
did not delete all references to the T symbol sources in the

. unclassified version for in Bureau's opinion to do so and to -

merely report results of investigation in a Bureau letterhead
without reference to various sources would create the impression
that Bureau representatives, in fact, conducted the reported
investigation. Note, however, that all references in your
Classified version to the first confidential source abroad have
-either been deleted or attributed to T-17, who is identified in
your 5/18 letter transmitting the summary. In addition, all
references to T symbol sources, who obviously were members of the
Embassy staff, have been deleted. The latter area includes
reporting of results of interviews of people who called at the
Embassy to volunteer. information.

In preparing the unclassified version, the Bureau has
endeavored to include therein results of all investigation,
specifically requested by the Commission ,and any investigation
which was touched upon in the Commissions summary report.
Accordingly, it was not possible to completely delete all of the
information concerning ieee Sn; The information concerning
Small furnished byAMEX 1 9 een further condensed
in the unclassified version oe ates when information was
furnished by sources have been deleted.

In view of the extensive. investigation conducted
into the allegations of Gutierrez Valencia and in light of the .
tenuous nature of his claims, Bureau deemed it inadvisable to
delete his identity.

In accordance with your suggestions, the names of
most of the Mexican Government officials who provided information
have been either deleted or protected by informant ‘symbol in
the unclassified version. \

If after review of the unclassified letterhead you
desire to prepare your contacts in the Mexican Government for its
publication, you are authorized to do so. It is suggested in
this regard that you point to the statement of the President's
Commission outlined above and stress to your contacts that the
excellent investigative résults obtained in connection with the
matter at hand, which was‘of world-wide importafce, should
reflect favorably upon the Mexican Government. . Note that the
unclassified letterhead which has been furnished to the Commission
