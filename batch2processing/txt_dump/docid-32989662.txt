Iw. Kennedy said he was considering the possibility of a
telephone surveillance of King because of King's communist

the productivity of such a surveillance was doubtful and he
was asked to consider the repercussions if it ever became
known that such a surveillance had been instituted on King.

cussions and that he thought it advisable to have as complete

by former Attorney General Robert F,. Kennedy and installed
by this Bureau.

On July 16, 1963, an official of this Bureau
‘saw Mr. Kennedy at the latter's request. On that occasion,
Mr, Konnody said he was considering tle possibility of a
telephone surveillance of King because of King's communist
associations. He was advised by the Bureau official that
since King was in travel status practically all the time,
the productivity of such a surveillance was doubtful and he
was asked to consider the repercussions if it ever became
known that such a surveillance had been instituted on King,
Mr. Kennedy said he was not concerned about possible reper-
cussions and that he thought it advisable to have as complete
coverage as possible in view of the possible communist influ-
ence in the racial situation. He was told that the feasibility
. of such coverage would be determined and an appropriate
recommendation would-be submitted to him. yu

On July 25, 1963, Mr. Kennedy changed his mind
eoncerning his request and thought it i11 advised at that
time, but on October 7, 1963, a request for authority to.

Obviously these are particularly
