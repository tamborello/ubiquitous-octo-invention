On one trip to Cuba, CACHTTA™ “asked him to’ look into the

and informed.the ROJAS that the situation now is extraordinarily
good but that TERESA was once under a death sentence because

do not know how to cope with the present situation. They

fear going to Cuba and they are speaking out against the Cuban
revolution in a most forthright: manner. The bitterness dis-

The source stated that some years ago, as best he
could recall, he heard JUANA LUISA PRORMNZA, a sister of CACHITA
who died some years ago, telling as ar story of how TERESA
PROENZA was somehow invo ‘with LEE’ HARVEY OSWALD at. the
Cuban Wmbassy. At the: TERESA ‘was employed at the embassy,
she lived with JUANA* LUISA and another sister. Within the

While it is not clear from available informatien,
it would appear that PROENZA was able to return from Cuba
for a a fie to Mexico following her dismissal and departure
in'1/64. ‘€

By report dated 1/14/85 the CIA reported on the in-
vestigation. by the cuban government of old line communist
JOASUIN ORCOLUL MESA. -In this report it was indicated that

TERESA PROENZA had bea errested at her home and was being
held incommunicaco {e .

 

 

A review of the foregoing material indicates that”
TERESA PROENZA got into trouble with the Cuban government more
as a result of her criticism of the handling of the OSWALL
matter following the assassination of President KENNEDY than
because of anything she cid when CSWALD visited the Cuban
Embassy. LEer harsh criticism of Aigh Cuban officials (the
Ambassador and Foreign Minister) was appareptly well known
in the embassy and hardly helpec her case. @it fails to cK) :
indicate that she did anything for CSWALD that would supstantiate
the remarks made by JORG® ROJAS and his wife tof MEX 197] that Ely
TERESA PROENZA hac nearly been executed because Of her activities
during CSYALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy in 19¢ in the
absence of additional information regarding this activity, no
further investigation is contemplatec at this time. it is’
noted that it is not feasiblg to directly interrogate JONCE ,
RCJAS or his wife. However [er 197} will closely follow this IY
matter with them and any acditional, significant developments
will be called promotly to the attention of the Bureau.
