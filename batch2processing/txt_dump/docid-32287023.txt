yourself to them things. How is SAMBO? Is
he through with the hives?
CELANO: Who SAM? —
BRODKIN: ‘RIP,
CELANO: Yeah, he's better.
BRODKIN: There's a classy little guy.
How is PAUL? I ain’t seen PAUL in a long
time. How is he? ; ; ;
" CELANO: Where's he gonna go if Italy don't want him?
BRODKIN: That's good. If Italy don't want him, that's
. good, then he stays right here, You know that
don't ya?
-CELANO: If Italy don’t want him?
‘BRODKIN: That's right, They can’t send him to another
country besides his place of origin.
CELANO:. He has renounced his citizenship in Italy and

they don’t want him.

The reference to "HANDSOME" is a reference to
GUS ALEX, it being noted that BRODKIN frequently refers to
his close friend, ALEX, as "HANDSOME." The reference to
"that doll" is obviously a reference to MARIANNE RYAN ALEX,
who divorced ALEX in February, 1961. It has been learned
that ALEX continues to have a great deal of affection. for
his former wife. Interview with LOUIS. SILVER, who owns the
Ambassador Hotels in Chicago where the exclusive Pump Room
is located, determined that MARIANNE RYAN, as was previously
known, models on Thursdays at noon in the Pump Room. SILVER
advised that frequently ALEX-comes to the Pump Room on
Thursday afternoon and sits in a corner drinking a cup of
coffee while watching his former wife model. SILVER advised
that. it is obvious that ALEX carries a “hard, hot torch"
for MARIANNE, MARIANNE, who is identical with CG 6445=PC,
advises that she occasionally speaks with ALEX but that she
has had no close connection with him since their divorce.
