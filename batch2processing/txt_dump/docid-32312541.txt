The referenced Bu airtel, 10/17/60, instructed the
NYO to furnish with this report a detailed analysis of the
witnesses available totestify to the registration act aspects
and the subversive aspects of this case. This is being set
forth under separate cover, ‘This report has been divided
into two sections, first part dealing with information furnished
by sources dfidicating an infiltration onthe part of the’ --"- .
SWP and affiliated organizatiorsof the FPCC and the Communist
Party infiltration of the Committee; also committee associations
with organizations or individuals with a history of prior sub-
versive activity. The second part, the registration data, deals
with interest on the part of the Cuban Governnent in the FPCC
and the interviews of CHARLES SANTOS BUCH which indicate that
the Cuban Government supplied $3500.00 to pay for the original
ad published by the Committee in the ‘" New York Times", 4/6/60.

Field divisions where rpcc activity has taken place
are being furnished copies of this report. It will be noted
that the SWP in particular and the CP are making heated —
efforts to infiltrate and control the FPCC and have been :
quite successful to date especially in NY and Chicago, They
are also extending their activities to various universities |
throughout the country in an attempt to capture sympathy on :
the part of liberal thinking students for the Cuban Revolution. .
The Bureau instructed that this investigation must be given
vigorous and continued attention. All investigation associated
