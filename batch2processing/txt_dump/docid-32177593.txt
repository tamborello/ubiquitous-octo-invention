which the British plewed up in April, 1963, but which may
now be usable. Coast Guard Intelligence Office, Miami, had
no information regarding. Such a base,

of reprisal if it were reyealed that he had identizied these

appropriate. to disseminate the identity of the “aAnericans" at
this time, nor is it deemed advisable to approach or interview -
either one. Case kiibeen opened to obtain background through

ADMINESTR. BY

 

Tampa has assumed origin in this matter under the
caption of ANTI~CASTRO GROUP, ORLANDO, FLORIDA, ss it has not

-been clearly established that this group officially represents

the Second National Pront.of Escambray (SNFE) (Operation Alpha 66}
on which Miami is origin. _The latter designation is added to
the title in this report for the sake of clarification, as

most of the information developed on the Orlando, Fla., group
appears to pertain to SNFE, Operation Alpha 66.

CIA advised the Bureau on 9/17/63 it had no -
operational interest in the project mentioned at Orlando, Fia.,
concerning the T-6. military type aircraft purchased by Alpha 66 —
and ite plans to ready this aircraft for possible raids against
FibEi., CASTRO,

By 2irtel dated 10/1/63, the Miami Division advised
the Bureau that FAA, Customs, and the Coast Guard were contacted
relative to the above-mentioned aircraft, the key allegedly being
used as a base which has an airstrip, and‘ the two Americans who
offered their services, all of which was with negative results,

Ali sources at Miami were alerted to immediately
furnish any infcrmation bearing on possible neutrality matters,

"including air raids or attacks by boat.

 

"On connection with the particular allegation that

the group has a key on which they have stored arms and ammunition, —

as woll as an airstrip, the following is noted.

U. 8, Coast Guard Patrol Surveillance and Reconnaissance

Plan dated 9/26/63 reflects Coast Guard has air patrols in the
