“SCAGLIONE, TONY, Tampa, Florida \

SUMIO, JAMES, 3215 12th Street, Tampa (This is LUMIA) (Deceased)

URGA, JOSEPH, Indian Rocks Beach, Florida (Deceased of very
récent date)

VIGLICIA, JOSEPH, Tampa, Florida
ZUMMO, THOMAS, 915 Tampa Street, Tampa

On May 5, 1959, TP T (PAUL ANTINORT, former
TP 22-C) advised SA LABADIE relative to the above as follows:

ANGELO AGLIANO, 1711 Kathleen Street, Tampa, operates fish
markets, and never was member of Mafia, nor in small clique
of alien smugglers, bootleggers, gamblers, or narcotic violators,

FRANK AGLIANO, 2207 North Albany, Tampa; PROVIDENCE AGLIANO. :
1914 5th Avenue, Tampa; and SALVATORE AGLIANO, 1921 East Broad- '
way, Tampa, were not members of Mafia. '

EUGENE ANZALONE, 2930 22nd Street, Tampa, was never member but
used to work for the City of Tampa under former Mayors CHAUNCEY
and HIXON and used to think he had political influence.

FRANK DIECIDUE and his brothers, according to this” ‘Source, are
members of the Mafia.

SALVATORE FERRILITA. Source does not know such persons, but is
of opinion this should be FERLITA family, but in such case,
FERLITA family never was in the old Mafia group: .

 

FIGUROTO, "the entire family." Source did not know such a

family and of opinion it should be JOSEPH FICCAROTTA family,

who in the early 1900-1920 stages in Tampa was definitely a Oo !
part of the Italian Mafia group. However, JOSEPH FICCAROTTA was |
hanged in West Tampa about 1920 and for the past twenty years ‘
his family is not Mafia type.

JOSEPH GAGLIANO, 3128 Cypress Street. Source reported has known
this man well for many years and man was never inany ‘Mafia
group. i

ANTHONY, JOHN, JOSEPH, and SAM GIGLIO. Source related this
family had belonged to the Mafia and their father, PHILIP
GIGLIO, did belong to the group; however PHILIP became a
carpenter and contractor and did not follow actions after the
early 1920's. Source said PHILIP GIGLIO is still living, is
known as "Fifi" and resides about the 900 block Columbus Drive,
Tampa.

; Reference is now made to Bureau Airtel 8/26/63
entitled"Criminal Intelligence Program", wherein the Bureau
points out: "It is readily apparent that we undertake
inquiries to identify all members of LA COSA™ NOSTRA, and there-
after clearly establish their position and contribution~to the
organization. We have already undertaken a substantial step
in this direction in an all out effort to develop additional

, Sources and informants, which will be of assistance in. this
“regard.” ‘Whenever. an allegation is received or information is
developed that an individual is a member of LA COSA NOSTRA, an
appropriate Anti-Racketeering investigation must .be promptly
' ; initiated.

‘The. Bureau further notes that some of the individuals
dn the organization will not require continuous, all-out investi-
- gation for an extended period, and suggests the ones of lessér
prominence ~ after their background and current activities have
‘been verified and reported, such cases may be placed in a pending
inactive status for a period of six months, after which time
it would be re-opened for the purpose of re-establishing his
current activities and reporting t the information accumulated
