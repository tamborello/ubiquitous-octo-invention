Ps

i ‘Bource and discussed highlights of meeting between SCAFIDI and
. IGNATIUS DENARO, Underboss, Philadelphia, which had taken place
earlier, 3/6/69. SCAFIDI, of Bridgeton, N.J., had traveled to
Philadelphia for this meeting at the request of DENARO.
: SCAPIDI Said that DENARO reported that ANGELO BRUNO had been to
+ see. "who he had to see” in regards to the refusal of JOSEPH
'. RUGNETTA, Consilieri, Philadelphia Family, to attend an induc-
| tion ceremony previously scheduled, January 25-26, at Vineland,
: N.J.5 because the ceremony was being held in New Jersey and not
. in the Philadelphia area. BRUNO received instructions, be-
lieved by Source to have been from a member of Commission, LCN,
to not create any friction in Philadelphia Family over the pro-
posed induction of three new members. Additionally, Source was
questioned and advised that JOHN CAPPELLO had referred to
. .  “goreky" by the name of “CARL.” On 3/7/69, JOSEPH SCAFIDI said
7. . ‘that he had, that day, discussed with DENARO the death of VITO
a GENOVESE,. GENOVESE's family was deserlbed by SCAFIDI as being.
: > one of the largest in the LCN in the New York area. "One-half"
of this LCN family was formerly | the family of FRANK COSTELLO,-

‘  GARL JAMES. CIVELLA, aka "Corcky!’ was identified by SCAFIDI as.
me the person who DENARO had sald was taking over GENOVESE's family: i
Oo and would also be a member of Commission, LCN. DENARO believes «
that CARL JAMES CIVELLA will move-to New York; however, this was
‘ apparently an opinion. ; ;

Source is scheduled to visit SCAFIDI, who is Source's
Capodecina, Sunday, 3/9/69,. and any additional details in the
above matter will be brought to the attention of the Bureau and .

. interested offices. '
