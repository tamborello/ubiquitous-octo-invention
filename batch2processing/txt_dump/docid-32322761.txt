Forum of Texas, Inc., from the time of its organization in
about September, 1954, until about October, 1955, was under
the control and domination of CP members; that since about
October, 1955, this chapter has only been infiltrated by a
few CP members who attended occasional meetings, This
informant had no information indicating CP members were
being active in the affairs of that chapter.

WILLIAM J. LOWERY (former Db.2-S), DL 6- Sand
former DL 18-S, advised in July, 1955 that they do not
believe the subject could ever be recruited into the CP

.or would ever be sympathetic to the CP. These informants
have all advised that MOLINA opposed | the CP faction within
the GI Forum.

 

 

 

-., On 11/30/63, WILLIAM J. LOWERY (former DL 2-S)
advised that he was contacted by JOE MOLINA who was con-
sidering a law suit against certain Dallas newspapers, radio

\ stations and possibly the Dallas Police Department for
alleging he was a communist.

 

Dallas will’submit a security-type report on all
activities of MOLINA and his association with Dallas CP
members in the Dallas Chapter of the American GI Forum.
