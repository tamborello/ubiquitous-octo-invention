again at that time expressed his position that he would not
volunteer to limit his share of the profits in order to comply
‘with. ALDERISIO's demands. Mx. EGAN stated that ALDERISIO, at
this time, -'stated that he had made an agreement with BRAY to
receive a one-third interest in the deal and ALDERISIO added
after EGAN stated he did not believe such an arrangement had been
effected, that he, ALDERISIO; was there at the time the deal

was made and that he-personally believed it.

 

EGAN stated that: there was no doubt | in his mind at that

  

portion of: ‘the ‘whole deal in that he. had ‘stated to EGAN that he .
might just as. well: make up his mind to this fact and added that, ee
“You know we don't use the courts." no

EGAN reiterated that this comment by ALDERISIO together
with others, which | were made by. him frequently :and'-which included‘.
such sta ements. . cas’ "You know who I am" and. "You"know what I mean’,
were interpreted’ by: *him-as. implied threats indicating that-
‘ALDERESIO would do anything, ‘that was necessary in order to accom-
plish. his purpose. EGAN stated that as a. matter of fact, the
C DERISI 0 during ‘the entire period of the meeting
was ‘such as’ te ‘eréate this: impression -and. he, was convinced that
the ‘sole objec of the meeting at: ‘SAM,’ ‘KAY"'s office was’ to
let him know that. “this ‘was the situation. .

 

 
  
 

EGAN. pointed out ‘that the matter of his daughter was
not brought. into: the conversation: until after he had indicated .
that he would not consent to ALDERISIO"s demands -and for this ©
reason, he was.not only gravely-concerned for his own. saféty
but for the safety of his daughter as-well, He added that: the.
‘manner in-which his daughter had been’ brought. into the conversation
was: such that ‘he had. to assume - that. ALDERISIO wanted hin. to know

that if he cared for her, he would consent to ALDERISIO' s
demands for a one-third interest in the entire deal. -

EGAN explained further that although no comment had.
‘been made by ALDERISIO. as to the specific action that could or ~
would be taken-to influence his demands, EGAN was confident that
ALDERISIC did not want there to be any doubt that he would go
as-£ar ag necessary and that this could, of course, include either
him or his daighter being maimed or killed.

“EGAN concluded that: based upon his interpretation of
all of the various comments made by ALDERISIO, he hadto assume
that the very worst could happen to him and.it was for this Be
reason he had discussed the possibility of being afforded ‘pro- poh
tection and which request was approved and provided at thé direction
of the Departmental Attorneys with whom he had been in close and a
frequent contact. -

JAMES WILLIAM EGAN states that although he had previously

mentioned demands by ALDERISIO as relating to one-third of

the profits of deal that he, EGAN, and BRAY had with SAM KAY, -

this would have actually amounted to a sum of $200,000 in view ,

of the terms of their contract with SAM KAY, which specified a

total profit of $600,000 to be received by them. EGAN states that

he had not consented to the demands as being made by ALDERISIO,

who explained that he was referring to one-third of entire deal

and not just to a portion of BRAY's share. _ EGAN states that

ALDERISIO thereafter specifically commented that he was taking a
one-third of entire deal; that EGAN might as well make up his - :

EGAN states that demeanor of ALDERISIO during entire period of
meeting was such that there was no doubt in his mind that ALDERISIO
would do absolutely anything necessary to accomplish his purposé
and he, EGAN, was convinced that the sole objective of the meeting
at SAM KAY's office was to let him know that this was the situation.
-EGAN states that although no comment was made as to the specific
action that could or would be taken to enforce ALDERISIO's demands,
he was gravely concerned for both his own safety as well as for a

a manner as to indicate that if he cared for her, he would
consent to the demands being made for a one-third share in the
entire deal. EGAN concluded that all of the statements made by
ALDERISIO, as well as the manner in which they were made, were -
interpreted by him to have been made for the sole purpose of |
letting him know that he would be in danger if he tried to do

‘ anything contrary to ALDERISIO's demands. ALDERISIO SHOULD BE

DETAILS:

Mr. EDWARD HARRINGTON, Departmental Attorney,
appeared at the Denver Office on January 7, 1964,: at which =
time he advised Special Agents ARTHUR W. ENGSTROM and PAUL E. ,
BUSH that he had been in contact with JAMES WILLIAM EGAN on the
previous date and that during this contact, EGAN had mentioned
for the very first time that the demands previously made by
FELIX ANTHONY ALDERISIO had related to the specific sum of
$200,000. Mr. HARRINGTON stated that in all previous
conversations relating to the demands made by ALDERISIO, EGAN
had indicated that ALDERISLO was demanding a one-third interest ~
in their South American deal, and for this. reason requested
that EGAN be reinterviewed for additional details as to the.
specific sum of money now being recalled and mentioned by him.
