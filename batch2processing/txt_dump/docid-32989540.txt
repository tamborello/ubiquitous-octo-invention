I told Guthman he had raised several points that should be Straightened

Informal Memo to Mr. Mohr >
Re: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

| zormation to the newspapers concerning King.

the Department, the Attorney General, Katzenbach, Assist
and Guthman, were the only ones who knew of King's connections with Stanley
Levinson, I told Guthman that Burke Marshall undoubtedly knew of such connections
inasmuch as I believe he had talked to King. Guthman admitted this was true.

From the tone of Guthman's entire remarks, it would appear he had
two thoughtsin mind without actually stating such thoughts. These thoughts were
(1) that the Attorney General is most anxious that information concerning King not
be released; and (2) that the Attorney General's connections with King, and his
defensive statements concerning King to the Congress in Civil Rights hearings,
could certainly injure the Attorney General's political chances for the future.

of course, very close to the Saturday Evening Post, particularly in view of the
deliberate leaks of information to the Saturday Evening Post on the Cassini and

Valachi matters. Itold Guth man that if the Saturday Evening Post had obtained
information concerning King, it would appear that they might have received such
information from the same sources where they had gotten their previous facts.

Guthman reacted to this quite anxiously and stated all this may be true, however,

under no circumstances would they give any publication the facts concerning King.

In a very hurt tone of voice, he told me once again the Attorney General was not worried
about what an exposure of King could doto him. He stated he and the Attorney General

Following way com my conversation with the Director at approximately 10 AM
this morning, after the Director had talked with the Attorney General, I called Guthman
|jand told him he apparently had misquoted my conversation with him of last night.
I asked Guthman if he had told the Attorney General, in quoting me, that I had been
1]"quite concerned about a letter the Attorney General had written in which he defended
j{Martin Luther King." I told Guthman I had not mentioned any letter in my conversation
with him. Guthman replied that the Attorney General had gotten all mixed up in his
‘{conversation with the Director. Guthman admitted I made no reference to any letter.
He also admitted I had not indicated that I was "quite concerned" in referring to the
Attorney General, Guthman explained the basis of the Attorney General's call to the
Director by stating that he and Burke Marshall had gone over to see the Attorney General
and while in his office had mentioned the information which apparently has been
accumuiated py the Atlanta, Georgia, reporter. In explaining to the Artorney General,
Guthinan stared he tuid the Attorney Generai he had discussed this matter witn me
last night and that from the tone of my remarks, Guthman understood that (l) any
exposure of King might possibly jeopardize FBI sources; and (2) any exposure of Xing

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont
RE: DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

 

See the AG about it. We did this. After the AG read the letter
as changed he said he was not certain it would accomplish its
purpose. He called the President and told him what had happened.
Marshall and the AG tried to redraft a letter which would be in
line with our observations, #ach draft after written was dis-
cussed with the Fresident telephonically by the AG and none of
the drafts were satisfactory to the Fresident. He thereafter
decided that an innocuous letter saying nothing of substance
should be sent to Senator Russell which letter should be delivered
by AAG Marshall and me. At the time the letter was delivered
the Senator was to be furnished orally by Marshall with detailed
information as to Martin Luther King's activities, I was merely
to assure the Senator as to the sensitive position of cur informant
and tne fact that information from this informant of a continuing
tnature was vital to tre countrv's welfare. After the AG had left
the city Deputy AG Katzenbach was substituted for Burke Marshall
as Matzenbach knew tie Senator. an appointment to see the
Senator was made for 5:00 p.m., 11-1-63. At this meeting Katzenbach
furnished the Senator with information concerning King and his
communist connections, It was unnecessary for me to say anything
at this conference other than to confirm Katzenbach's statement
about the sensitiveness of our source. The Senator indicated
satisfaction with the explanation given to him by Katzenbach and
said that he did not intend to make any speech on the floor of the
Senate about this.

On my return to the Bureau that afternoon I prepared a
memorandum on this contact which is attached,

ae / the Department concerning letters to members of Congress dealing
¢ fo with Martin Luther King. In this connection the Director has
/ inguired as to my activities with regard to clearance of such
communications.

The only letter which I had anything to do with clear-
ing was one from the Attorney General to Senator Richard B.
Russell dated 11-1-63, The circumstances surrounding this are
as follows: Shortiy after noon on 11-1-63 Assistant Attorney
General (AAG) Marshall furnished to me the Department's file of
correspondence with Senator Russell concerning the association
of King with Hunter Pitts O'Dell, <A proposed letter to Senator
Russell for the Attorney General's (AG) signature dated 11-1-63
was attached. Marshall said he and the AG had discussed the
proposed letter with the President. Marshall asked us to con-
Sider the language in the proposed letter to Senator Russell to
determine if it would jeopardize our informant or otherwise
interfere with our investigation of communist matters,
