; REYNOL RODRIGUEZ-GONZALEZ is. a well-known FLNC
member in Puerto Rico; "CROZQUITO" (diminutive for the
name OROZCO) is probably RAMON OROZCO-CRESPO, a well~known
anti-CASTRO terrorist in Miami; FRANK CASTRO is no doubt the
FLNC leader in Santo Domingo. ,

Miami notes that MAX LESNIK, publisher of the
Miami newspaper and magazine "Replica" (Spanish language
and Cuban exile oriented publication) is suspected of
being a CASTRO sympathizer by some Miami Cuban exiles.
LESNIK reportedly is the originator of the slogan "Cuba Si,
Yankee No" during FIDEL CASTRO's takeover of Cuba in 1959.
