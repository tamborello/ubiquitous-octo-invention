All right...

First, let me just! ask if there is any substantial disagree

probably as good a balance.as you can on this figure, given

figure in that anyway. |
Senator Huddleston. Probably not. We hassled over it

pretty much, and I will say this: the staff that dia the. work

on the budget aid an outstanding job, so I think we had a better

look at the budget of intelligence than anybody has had.

Senator Tower. Well, I'll bet there is nobody around here

Senator Huddleston.- That is right, even the Administrationl.
I think it is reasonable. Of course, we will have a

question on the numbers that we have included maybe in the

I must say the latter: point raises a textual question which
we have to look at, and that is the way one describes what
revealing the national intelligence number would:'do in terms.
of the constitutional Lequirements.

‘What we have suggested here is on page 112 there are, I
think, some points of view which say that revealing that

i

number is not sufficient to satisfy the Constitution. There is.

 
 

another point of view whi h says that the national security

is. overriding and that thi number should not be disclosed at

all, and therefore even not disclosing any numbers still

‘What we have ateonpesy to capture in the first sentence

of the full paragraph on page 112 is what the Subcommittee, I

believe, felt was just about the right balance between the

requirements of national security and the requirements of the
Constitution. -

It reads, "The Committee believes that disclosure of an
aggregate figure for national intelligence is as far as it is
prudent to go at this stage in reconciling the nation's
constitutional and national security requirements.
