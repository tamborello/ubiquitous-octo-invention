ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

1, . During the past few months, the Station’ has been conducting
a*review of the ANSPELL project and analyzing its effectiveness past
-and current as well as its short and long term potential, The
foregoing, together with continuing problems with the AMSPELL
leadership: to conform to budgetary allotments and approved operational %
activities, has resulted in a decision to sharply reduce Station :

“support to the AMSPELL organizations

2. The AMSPELL: organization has been affected by the loss of
many of its most capable members who have outlived the youth/student
category and have resigned to seek employment. outside of the .JMWAVE
area, Marty of the departed members were those who have made major
«=. f--.contributions~in MHSPAWN activities, Those who. have remained are

. largely ineffective for use in Station MHSPAWN operations due largely -
to their. lack of credentials, interest, and talents in the youth/studen
field, and in addition a conflict of AMSPELL interests with KUBARK
has existed especially in the field of. paramilitary operations where
AMSPELL would ‘like to be independently active, The Station, through
principal agent Sherwood L. OVERBEY, has had a series of conversations
with the AMSPELL leadership and the result has been their acceptance.
of drastically reduced financial support, continuance of contact and ~.
willingness to respond to Station request for specific propaganda “y.
and political~action activities, ; . , ; és

3. The Station now-plans to provide maximum financial support
of $1,000.00 monthly to AMNSPELL beginning February 1966, The greater
portion of this sum will finance the printing and distribution of |

. & new, bi-monthly publication to be sent to selected international -
and PBRUMEN addressees, The remainder will be spent. for operational
expenses incurred by AMHINT-2, who will participate in the preparation
of the magazine and who will be available for maintaining contacts -
and for travel in the international student field, .and.for occasional
operational support and overhead expenses, Per A\HINT-2's request
and in view of the desire of ANSPELL members to seek independent
