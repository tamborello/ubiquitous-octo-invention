III. Planning for the Future

fs was indteated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes
to remain uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditures of
a@ great portion of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one
target...auch as Soviet Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically,
however, that should the need arise for LIFEAT te again assume such
responsibilities, it is fully able to do so, Until such time LIFEAT
will centime toe enjoy greater flexibility in the employment of its
assets, especially in the areas in which the Station dees not wish

to reveal its interest or operations te the liaison forces involved
in the LIERVOY operation.

V. Expenditures .

 

Approval for renewal. of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 August 1962 for
FY 1963 in the amount of $99,000.00, The proposed budget for FY 1964

Even with the operational emphasis of the LEIFEAT Project being

include a list of HMM's produced through May 1963 (approximately
10 months of the project year) as a by-product in the LIFEAT
operation.

of the ACGM including their travel plans to Mexico and in some cases

considers this coverage "quite valuable", Ag abso noted in previous
renewals, LIFEAT ability toe give the interested ease officers a check

tions and provides greater security for long t<rm assets who may have
been in contact with now terminated agents,

EH, Conclusion

Et is the opinion ef the Mexice City Station that the support previded
other Station operations, the CI/CE information and-leada, and the

- ability of the unilateral LIFEAT seperation te cover sensitive targets
without revealing Station interest te the liaison ferces, well justify
the expenditure of fimds, time, persomel] and security risk. As it has
veelied bet lente that evenmwith the Station's envolvement in the

% reason, LIFEAT, in addition to maintaining its present heavy

coverage, mist be available to once again undertake
official Soviet end Czech effieial targets in Mexico City. .
LIFEsT's present orientation, thoughhteward supporting Station operations
and CI/CE mission rather than toward tergets which would provide positive
intelligence, leaves it readily available for recall inte the Soviet-
Czeoh coverage. Tt is the Station's firm opinion that the LIFEAT
project provides a substantial and vital contribution in fulfilment the
several pricrity objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and
axe therefore not considered for fulfillment during any given peried of
time. For this reasen percentage figures as to completion of project
objectives camot be dram. However, an indication of the coverage
provided in working toward fulfillment of the objectives can be noted
in that approximately 12,500 pages of raw text were produced in the
period July 1961 through April 1963. LIFEAT has been in daily opera-
tion during the review period with the average number of lines covered
per month being 18, and a high in Oeteber 1962 of 25 lines covered,

LIFEAT/Migoslav: In addition to the usual information coneerning
the Yugoslav officials and their daily contacts and activities,
LIFEAT prowided leads which could pay off in future operations.

One example was a lead which revealed that a diplomatic courier
would be travelling alone and taking a new travel reute while
cerrying an official pouch. With this early warning, the Station
was able te plan an operation to provide access to this. correspan-
dence, Although Headquarters finally vetoed this particular oper-
ation, sufficient early warning was given by LIPEAT so that the
operation could have been carried ont, Another example of this

type of lead was the data available from LIFEAT coverage that a

new location was being sought for the Yugoslav Eabassy, and which
specific locations were under consideration, Armed with this informa-
tien the Station has been able to make a technical casing of one of
the prospective sites and obtain information necessary for entry inte
the other sites, .

LEFEAT/Exile: As noted previously, LIFEAT coverage of t the ° exile ;

is believed that the importance of this LIFEAT coverage can not be
stressed too mich, LIFEAT Coverage of e Costa Rican Cammmist exile

the life of an ODYOKE official by one group of the Republican Exiles.
Ultimately, LIVEAT revealed the departure from Mexico of two of the
vingleaders in the plot.

unilateral coverage, home phones of selected Soviet officials which
eould better support net only the Station's CE effort but also other
Station operations against the Soviet target. In this effort, LIFEAT

Yugoslav Coverage

LIFEAT coverage of the Yugoslav official installation in Mexico City
has provided a wealth of information on the contacts, activities, and
travel of members of that mission. Since the Station's effort against
this target was greatly increased within the last year, LIFEAT infor-
mation has been used extensively to provide the basie operational and
personality data necessary for this stepped-up program, Examples of
LIPEAT preduced pesitive intelligence and general operational informa-
tion on this target are as fellows:

E. American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM) |

As noted in past project reviews, most of the targets in this group
have been covered at the request of ODENVY, and the raw take has been
processed by them. During thepperied July 1962 through May 1963
approximately 3590 reels of take were passed to the local ODENVY for
their processing, On 23 August 1962 the local ODENVY advised, "This
office feels the coverage mentioned is quite valuable and many useful
leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly with regard to
travel in and out of Meaice ef American Commmists who are in contact
with individuals on whom eoverage is maintained”, Typical examples
