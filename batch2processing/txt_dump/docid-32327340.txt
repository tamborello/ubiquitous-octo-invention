ALLEY said that after several of these meetings, altho h
he could not state what exact point or date, LADISLAV Jdid not 55
appear quite as friendly or interested in him, ALLEY said that
there was a long period of time between the last twolor threa

explained that his work inEhe (anbasey|was consuming much more C$ :
of his time than previously, which alfowed him less time to
participate in the Thursday night social affair. xiys

 

ALLEY said that he now felt, in view of the foregoing,
thatf{LADISLAY)may have focused his attention on ALLEY for the SJ
purpose of seeing what he could learn. He observed that if such,“
was the case (LADISLAV) must have become discouraged and decided s3
that he was wasting his tine. Cg ys)

ALLEY said that,because of the casualness of his
association with PADISLAYShe had previously attached no significancel,$]
to this association, He said that he now realizes that (LADISLAV } 7.7 ;
might have regarded this association in an entirely different

manner.

Chicago T-1 stated that on October 29, 1959, (ABARCHALINE) C45
met ALLEY at the Townhall Square in Copenhagen after which
they went to a restaurant and later to a theater . G0! iA} i

Chicago T-1 further advise hat ALLEY appeared to have
been the individual who arranged for /ABARCHALINE to meet MARVING SD
KANTOR inasmuch as ALLEY indicated tof ABARCHALINE)on November 5 s)
1959, that he would introduce the lattér to KA R that eyening.
It was believed that on that evening ALLEY and({ABARC LINE] walkea
together to KANTOR'S address but failed to see hin. 60) ee

Chicago T=1 furnished the following information on
April 16, 1959: o7 u)

According to the United States Consul in Copenhagen,
‘MARVIN KANTOR recently visited the Consulate to have his
passport renewed, The Consular clerk noted an unspecified
number of visas and entry and exit stamps for Iron Curtain
countries, She commented that subject appeared to have
done a lot of travelling in Eastern Europe, to which he replied,
"Yes, that aids my studies." The clerk then asked KANTOR
if he would like to register with the United States Consulate,
after which .he inquired, "What does that involve?" .The clerk
explained that it provided a means of contact in the event someone
in the United States wished to reach him or should the Embassy
wish to provide him information which would be in his interest as
a United States citizen. According to the clerk, KANTOR very
definitely indicated his lack of desire to be registered in the
Consulate, He explained to the clerk that he was studying at the
University on the G.I. Bill and that he had recently been back
\ in the United States on a visit.

Chicago T-1 advised that a reliable source furnished
the following information:

KANTOR carries United States Passport Number 439313
and originally arrived in Denmark on July 26, 1957. Information
available to this source indicates that KANTOR’ S father, IRVING
KANTOR, and mother, SARAH, nee BRODSKI, immigrated to the United
States from the USSR appr oximatety 36 years ago. KANTOR is enrolled
at the University of Copenhagen, specializing in Slavic languages
and appears to be working toward a Masters Degree (magistereksamen).
The completign of work leading to this degree ordinarily requires
five years.,. (Ww)

KANTOR claims to receive a stipendium from the

United States for three years amounting to $110 per month.

When this stipendium expires, KANTOR expects his father to

support him financially. On one occasion he stated that’ he had

been home for the Christmas holidays from November 25, 1958, to
January 30, 1959. He has also stated that he plans to travel to
| Germany to purchase an automobile, and that from May 31, 1958, to
\

 

July 9, 1958, he participated in a study trip to Moscow. He has also
. stated that, if his progress in the Russian language continues, he
intends to visit Moscow again for a period of five or six months, Gh ly)

A professor at the University has described KANTOR
as "very diligent." KANTOR rents a room which costs him DKR 95
per month;., and he eats in an off-campus restaurant which is known
for its cheap but sizeable servings of food. It is estimated
that subject could cover his food and housing for less than
DKR 500 per month; however, this would not leave much left of the
: $110 for trips to scow and the United States, or the purchase of
an automobile ‘Ga u)

 

MARVIN KANTOR, born May 9, 1934, departed from Denmark
on May 28, 1959, via the Fedser-Marnemunde Ferry. Marnemunde is
located in East Germany. 9) u

'.  =Chicagg,T-1 stated at on the evening of November 16,
1959, {ABARCHALINE \was observed entering a local restaurant with Cs}
ALLEY ahd KANTOR, In the restaurant they joined two unidentified
individuals of Oriental appearance at one of the tables, It
appeared that all members of the group knew each other as they “yy
immediately entered into a rather animated conversation. They
looked at some papers or magazines one of which bore the title

. "Soviet Film.” Later in the evening, KANTOR left the restaurant

alone carrying a newspaper or magazine, ALLEY and (ABARCHALI 63)
departed.soon after TOR and ALLEY returned alone to his residence

a short time later. ; eee ne
