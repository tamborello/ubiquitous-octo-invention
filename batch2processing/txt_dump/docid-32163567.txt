3. From the time of his father's death until 1939
ROSTERSKI says that he was in faot a emall time criminal and
hie main income was derived from smuggling across the German,
Czechoslovak and Polish borders. As a result of these
activities he was imprisoned on several occasions in Poland,

   
 
   
    
 
   
  
  
 
  
 
    
   
 

be About December 1939 when the Russians invaded his

home town, Sambor in eastern Foland, he was arresjed and
deported to s prison camp at Magadan in eas beria, Whilst
imprisoned in Russia he met General KlemepefRUDNICKI, .At that
time KOSTERSKi was an old hand at prison life and knew his way
around. He helped the General on several occasions with the
prison authorities, °

 

2+, Later when serving in the Polish Army in the Middle
Bast, ACSTEXSKi again found himself under RUDNICKI'3 command
though KGSTZnSKI was then a sick man suffering from tuberculosis,
was unfit for fighting and was employed only in base employment,

i 9. General RUDNICKI seems to have some personal

sentiment for KOSTERSKI due to the latter having helped

him considerably during his imprisonment and to this day

i. he takes a fatherly interest in KOSTERSKI's well being.

I Although RUDNICKI's assessment of KOSTEXSKI may be

' moderated by personal feeling, it is nevertheless considered
to be a basically sound description of KOSTERSKI.

 

by, 10. RUDNICKI describes KOSTERSKL as. an essentially
decent person despite his oriminal pest. He says KOSTERSKI
ran is a somewhat boisterous and emotional character who cannot
pple f easily fit himself into society. He is a person who will
quarrel on the slightest provocation and appears to be
mentally unstable. From past experience RUDNICKI knows that
‘ KOSTERSKI is given to inventing involved stories frequently
: : with a political background, ost of these stories are
ry jargely figments of KOSTERSKI's vivid imagination.
Li Nevertheless, RUDNICKI maintains that these stories are ‘
‘ ‘based on some infinitesimal element of truth and in RUDNICKI's
1 estimation these stories may be said to contain no more than
' 5% of fact. @&

 

 

——A_

fo: lL. General RUDNICKI said that his relationship with

t KOSTERSKI was sueh that he felt KOSTERSKT would tell him the
truth about any matter if he pressed him, RUDNICKI was not
told of the reason for our present interest in KOSTERSKI.
