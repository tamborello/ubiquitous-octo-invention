From the foregoing information, it is the opinion of
the NYO that CIA has not disclosed the extent of their association
or their use of FIORINI and his group to the Bureau. It is
suggested that the Bureau, through established liaison, attempt

group in this matter, and whether or not they are actively

over Cuba. ¥ Ww
