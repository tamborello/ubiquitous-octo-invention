bombings which had occurred im Miami. FELIPE RIVERO,

responsible for the bombing of B25 cargo aircraft at Miami

the Cubans obtaining powder for any homemade bombs could. be
through Maule Industries, Miami, which handles explosive

powder and this company hires many Cuban employees.

with young Cubans and Puerto Rican male individuals and
that im contact with them he would remain alert to any
additional problems that may arise, eapecialty the bombing

against ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA during his trial for extortion
was that the threatening notes had beem typed om a type-

Cuban Power had something to write, they remted a type-
writer at the cost of $30.00 for the purpose, GONZALEZ
