COOPER (DL 162-208). . (The above actions by COX appeared to
verify information previously received from DL-95-C that COX,
as LITTLE’s runner, had connections at various private clubs
in Dallas where bets were placed during the week and which
were being laid off to LITTLE through COX). Subsequently COX
went to a drive-in at 1222 South Industrial where he drank
beer and where it appeared he picked up a young girl who was
driving a 1962 Chevrolet, Arkansas license -9-15281. This
girl was accompanied by another girl and when the woman who
was driving this car got into COX's car, the passenger then
drove off in. the Chevrolet. This car is registered to W. V.
RYAN, Hot Springs, Ark., no further information to datg.

On 12/6/62, GLADYS COMPTON, wife of FREDACOMPTON,
associate of subject LITTLE, was interviewed by Bureau Agents.
She advised that she had not seen her husband in thirty or
forty days and had no information as to his\whereabouts. She
stated that. her husband quite frequently "takes off" on drinking
sprees and-would be gone for long periods of time. She disclaimed
any knowledge of her husband's gambling activities or the gambling
activities at the Redmen Club but did state her husband was
a former officer in the Redmen Association, whose business it
was to establish such clubs throughout Texas and New Mexico.
