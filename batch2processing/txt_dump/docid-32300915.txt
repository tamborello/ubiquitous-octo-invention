estate business due to the recent death of his partner-
brother. In addition, it appears he has some reserva~
tions about testifying against ROSELLI, possibly due

to the information set out in mytel that former CG
6498-C-TE advised his family is close to the PETRONE
family. However, following his conversation with
NISSON, EVANGELISTA realizes his only option is to
travel to Los Angeles and testify and this he “will do
reluctantly. AUSA NISSON should be cautioned, however,
that EVANGELISTA may not be a strong witness.

. The problem presented by WELSH to NISSON
involving the physical hardship involved in carrying
two hundred pounds or so of records with him to Los’
Angeles. This was resolved by NISSON's approval of
WELSH's suggestion that these records be shipped
ahead which WELSH will do this date.

Both ANTHON and DEEVER suggested that they
telephonically contact NISSON to determine whether
they can submit certified copies of their records
rather than travel to Los Angeles. Thas was not
done in the presence of SA ROEMER but will probably
be done this date. Both were advised that shoutd
NISSON approve thas meéhod, they should contact the
Chicago Office which will insure that the certified
copies or depositions, as the case may be, are
forwarded to the Los Angeles Office prior to
April 2 next. 4 :
