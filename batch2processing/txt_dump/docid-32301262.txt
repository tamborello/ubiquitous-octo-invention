MM 105-1742

MM T-1 is EDWARD THOMAS PIATKOWSKI, former PSI,

Miami, who was interviewed by SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR.

Efforts by Miami to locate LUIS CONTE AGUERO at
his residence, 7 N. E. 47th St., were negative, and owner ©
of that residence advised she was told by CONTE AGUERO
about two weeks ago he and his wife were moving back to
New York City. DIAZ LANZ advised he had not seen CONTE
AGUERO for ten to fifteen days. He said wa result of
instant matter, AL has fallen apart over the disagreement
mentioned herein.

Since it would appear plans set out in reairtel
did not materialize, Miami contemplates no additional
inquiries. It is noted split with La Cruz by DANNY VASQUEZ
and MARISOL VASQUEZ was, according to DANNY VASQUEZ, done
at the suggestion of defected former Cuban Naval Attache
to the United States MIGUEL PONS, who, according to VASQUEZ,
is working with CIA.

It is suggested New York might consider contacting

CONTE AGUERO concerning this matter, if his whereabouts in

New York City is nown.
