TP 92-new

San Juan requested Miami and Tampa review files and
advise if there were any present connections, legal or illegal,
between LEAL and SANTO TRAFFICANTE,

 

In view of the above, a review of the Tampa file was
made and the following is set forth, noting Miami is being
considered Office of Origin, and it appears San Juan should

; conduct investigation to determine LEAL's activities in San
Juan, establishing whether he is operating legally or illegally
for himself or fronting for someone else.

TP 8-C, who has furnished reliable information in the
past and who is presently furnishing his services to the Las
Vegas Division, advised on October 19, 1961 that through sources
familiar with Cuban activities in Miami, OTTO SIRGO, a Cuban
actor described as a "drug addict" and who was involved in a
narcotics traffic in Cuba, as well as RENE CABELL, a Cuban singer, :
were in the Miami area at such time and that their names were
linked with EUGENIO LEAL, who was described as formerly operat-—
ing the Montmarte Night Club and Casino in Havana, Cuba, Source
said that if these two individuals were in Miami, LEAL in all --
probability was too. t

 

MM 492-S advised at: Miami, Florida on 1/25/62 that
SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR. was in contact with EUGENIO LEAL, a
recent arrival from Cuba. LEAL, according to source was a
close friend and associate of SANTO TRAFFICANTE in Cuba and \
also the source was close to LEAL,

HERBERT WALL, Miami attorney (protect identity) on °
recontact May 16, 1963 in Miami, Fla., confidentially advised
the identity of his clients who had leased the "Orange Sun", .
a cruise ship then running from Miami to Bimini for gambling . :
purposes, were AVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL and EUGENIO LEAL, x

EUGENIO " LEAL POGO was interviewed in the Spanish
language inasmuch as he does not speak English, on June 7, 1963
