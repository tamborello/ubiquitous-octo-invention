BROWDER with AUSA ROBERT H. NEWMAN to determine if he plans

PCI ROY KATON contacted SA JOHN P. LENIHAN on

_ April 30, 1962, and stated he recently had several contacts
with CARL BROWDER, adopted son of ED BROWDER and real son
of LILYAN BROWDER. CARL related he intensely hates ED
BROWDER. CARL said ED BROWDER convinced him to leave with
‘him and to go to the West in the latter part of 1961, as
ED BROWDER told CARL he was going to get him registered at
a military school in Arizona. CARL told KATON that appar-
ently while BROWDER was on his, trip West, he learned the
Supreme Court had turned down his appeal on the Canadian
bond theft case and he apparently then decided to flee the
country and they went into Mexico. CARL told KATON that
BROWDER had prohibited the boy from calling his mother,

LILYAN BROWDER; however, one night. when BROWDER had left the
motel where they were staying near Mexico City, CARL BROWDER
did phone LILYAN BROWDER. When ED BROWDER returned to the
motel and CARL told him he had phoned LILYAN, ED became
infuriated and under the pretense that he, ED, was going

to a movie, he disappeared and left CARL. stranded at the
“motel, “faced with a large motel bill and with no funds to
get home to Miami.

KATON said that BROWDER's friend, RUDY, is actually
RUDY PICHARDO, that there is not any question in his mind
but that PICHARDO was probably paid by BROWDER to perjure
himself at the second BROWDER trial, though neither BROWDER
nor PICHARDO has ever admitted that to him or anyone else
KATON knows of. KATON believes that PICHARDO lives in or
around Washington, D. C., and he would attempt to get
PICHARDO's address.

On May 14, 1962,.PCI ROY KATON telephonically
contacted SA LENIHAN and stated that the rumor he heard
regarding BROWDER's connection with this stolen bond case
was that BROWDER had gotten the bonds from some Boston
mobsters who have some connection with Miami's wire service
‘operator, BILL CAUDELL. It appears that in some fashion,
BROWDER double crossed this Boston group. They allegedly
provided him with these stolen Canadian bonds and also some
money to make a trip to Switzerland, as BROWDER said he
could get a high price for the bonds in Switzerland.~
Apparently, BROWDER was not able to sell the bonds in
Switzerland and the Boston mobsters feel:- ‘that..BROWDER has
double crossed them in some fashion.

The confidential source abroad mentioned in this
report is Legat, Mexico, airtel to Bureau dated 5/22/62.
