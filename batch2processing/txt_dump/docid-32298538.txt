MARQUEZ claimed that he had been informed that
fronts were being started in Panama, Venezuela, Vietnam, and
Peru, and stated that individuals'from various Latin American
countries came to this school to thank the Cuban} Government
for its assistance. To his knowledge, the guerrillas in.
Peru consisted of both Peruvians. and Cubans, but most of the
fronts were directed by Cubans. “:One officer in this school
had reportedly informed MARQUEZ that CHE GUEVARA had personally
opened a front in Peru. : .

ERNESTO CHE GUEVARA. is the former
Cuban Minister of Industries whose?)
current whereabouts are unknown.

 

MARQUEZ further claimed that at the time of GUEVARA's
disappearance, GUEVARA's fronts began moving in Peru. He also
claimed that GUEVARA had been on a tour of various Latin
American countries at the time of his disappearance. Through
the review of bulletins issued at the school, the students
were advised of the progress of revolutionary activities in
other Latin American countries. MARQUEZ believed this
information to be true as some d' the information was w-
corroborated by United States radio stations. MARQUEZ
believed that the Cubans infiltrated Latin America by way '
of Czechoslovakia. $)

 

MARQUEZ claimed that he was placed on the "SS Frucuba”
in January, 1966, where he was assigned es a cook. He had
been transferred from the Unit of the Vestern Army of the
Military Service to Navy Headquarters, Havana, Cuba, to
facilitate his transfer to the Merchant Marine. Orders had
been issued to him through the Ministry of Security, of :
which G-2 is a branch. While aboard ship, he was under the . !
ship's security department and his job was to spy on the ‘
other members of the crew and report on their activities and i
political outlook to the Ministry of Security. The Ministry i
was concerned over the number of Cuban crewmen seeking asylum :
in Canada. MARQUEZ considered himself to be a type of
political commissar on board the ship. MARQUEZ claimed to
have done nothing from December 25, 1965 to the ship's
departure from Cuba on January 22, 1966 When he was assigned
to the "SS Frucuba", MARQUEZ first believed that he might -
be going to Peru, but prior to boarding the ship, he had tof)

approached by a young person from Artemesa, Pinar del Rio, :
Cuba (not further identified) and asked to participate in a
_plan to sabotage the electrical’ supply for the barracks at |
Le Piedra. MARQUEZ claimed that he was in favor of the
activity, but felt that the plan would not work. He thus
stated that he remained neutral. While he was on gvard
duty, the electrical supply unit was destroyed and MARQUEZ
was placed under arrest in San Cristobal for 15 days and his
loyalties were investigated. He claimed that several persons
were involved in this sabotage plan, but that he did not know
their names. MARQUEZ claimed further that an individual whom
he refused to identify for fear of reprisals, who was a high
government official and is still a member of the CASTRO
Government, formulated the petition which freed MARQUEZ
from prison. MARQUEZ did claim that this individual is an
anti-Communist and does not agree with the current system
in power in Cuba today. Pa

was then informed that he wasbeing sent to a course in
guerrilla warfare and military leadership.so that he might
be placed in-a Latin American country. The applicant was
then asked to: agree to attend this school in such terms
that MARQUEZ felt‘that he would be insane to refuse. Upnan
approval, the applicant was furnisned two complete army
uniforms, a .45 automatic and the regular equipment issued

warfare. The classes ran from 7:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. with a. {
half hour lunch period, five days a week. During the' evenings, :
political lectures were given from 8:00 p.m. to around midnight.
Tests for the previous week's ckasses were given on the |
following Monday, and the udents engaged in voluntary work
projects on the festenas.(S) :

 

 

The students received lectures in ambush, sabotage,
and hit and run tactics. The supposed aim of the guerrilla
_ was to befriend the people in the area the suerrillas were
operating and to create conditions whereby the local army
would alienate the people. Instructions were given in all
types of small warms, bombs, and grenades, both handmade and
army issued.(g) ME cea
