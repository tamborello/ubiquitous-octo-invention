“ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

(FOREIGN INFLUENCE)
Re Bureau letter to Los Angeles, 11/6/68. A

The veferenced communication instructed Miami
to furnish its observations on compedmising the security
of MM 639-S should GERALD PATRICK BEMMING and/or JOSE
ANTONIO DUARTE-OROPESA be interviewed concerning their |
knowledge of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)
members traveling to Mexico to receive guerrilla training.

 

Miami is of the opinion that such interviews,
conducted with discretion, and in a manner in which the
Ot} source would not be revealed, would not posé a risk to the
security of MM 639-S.

HEMMING, if experience proves true, probably
discussed the matter with others also. HEMMING is a
former source of the Miami Office. When contacted in the
past, he was amiable and appeared cooperative. The caution-
ary opinion expressed by MM 639-S with respect to his reli-
ability should, however, be taken into consideration.
