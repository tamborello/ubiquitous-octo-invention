The U. S. Army Operations and Research Detachment was asked to

institute confidential communications (both telephone and mail) coverage on
the FUEGER address in Munich, That agency had advised that it independently

‘ determined that FUEGER had moved to Riederau as reported by the BKA, and that
no telephone service was yet in effect at the house in Riederau.. Efforts are
being made, however, to cover mail and telegraph communications to this address.
The agency,stated, however, that because Riederau is a small village, it may
be difficult to provide full coverage.

The above information regarding. subject's reported presence in
Kitzbuehel was furnished to Legat in Bern by telephone on 122862,
