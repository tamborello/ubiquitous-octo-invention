1. On 2 May,1977 Chris Hopkins and Amie Goodpasture
visited the cord's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search of additional photographs of the
“unidentified man". We were unable to locate any such

- been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and
\’ a that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
: ' forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters

for retention. Following are the Job numbers of
and pertinent notations re re-use of the old
