: . PICARD's security file elso indicated he was . :
investigated in 1952 in connection with State employment. oe |
This investigation indicated his father had a record of
hospital commitments for dipsomania and had been or was
| ' addicted to the use of drugs, The father is now deceased.

His security file also contains an evaluation work-
sheet of 8/26/54/9/27/54. It was noted that he was asked what
his attitude was toward military service. He replied he would
accept it as a duty as a citizen, but was not looking forward
to it a.id hoped he would not have te serve.

 

: Routine attempts to locate the security files of . od
[seace See and PICARD met with the. reply that Mrs. ANNA WUENSCHEL |

her and PICARD available to anyone, referring inquiry to the nn

jSecurity. Delay was experienced' in PICARD's case since his case

jis presently up for administrative action by State Security 4
in connection with revalidating his clearance and an overall "
evaluation of his status with State Department. :

Mes. GOLDSTEIN's security file was sealed, and
dadministrative clearance was nécessary for it to be opened for i
ij ceview. The file was sealed at her request in accordance with
[allowable procedure. The reason apparently for same is that
'Mes. GOLDSTEIN had a child born “out of wedlock" after her first
| marriage ended in divorce. The file contained no other information
pertinent to the allegation involved, and the above is not being’
set forth in LHM in the interest of good judgment and discretion.
wit was noted, however, in a Cic investigation that her given

ename at pirth was ADA VIRGINIA ROBARDS which she discontinued
ya an early age for reasons not’ set forth.

_ ANALYSIS

It is apparent from the enclosed LHM that the
authenticity of the original information is questionable. :
it appears that FREDERICK PALMER PICARD is. intended by the :
reference to CHESTER A. PICHARD, for whom there is no Stat
record, or a confusion between CHESTER: A, PICARD and PICARD.
tThe information also indicates that Mrs. GOLDSTEIN had acquired
i certain confidential information and that it was indicated that
this information concerned LEE HARVEY OSWALD and the assassination.
it would seem likely that during the ccurse of the LEE HARVEY
P OSWALD and assassination investigation, almost unparalleled in
i Bureau history, that any information Mrs. GOLDSTEIN had possess oY

“ revealed that State had checked SABLACK's Security file which
contained no adverse information. ,

. Mr. SZLUK suggested and arranged an interview of
Dr. LEWIS KE. WOODWARD, Director, Medical Division, USDS, as of
: possible assistance in this matter. On 1/11/65, Dr. WOODWARD
' “confidentially advised SA MORRISSEY that PICARD was a sick

“understandably stressed condition was aggravated somewhat by
his attempt to doctor himself with various pills available. He -

PICARD's security file also contained an undated
"Limited Official Use" memo for the record which revealed that
a Mr. BRUCE. VAN VOORST of Newsweek met with Mr. DONHAUSER and
'. Me. WHITEHOUSE of State on-3/24/64, to discuss questions that
VAN VOORST had raised with Mr. WILLIAM LEWIS of INR re the . i
conduct of PICARD in Zanzibar. VAN .VOORST said his bureau had : i
received info from a very high level Departmental source that : :
tir. PICARD had a bad record before his assignment to Zanzibar; i
that he was an alcoholic; that he had insisted on evacuating his :
Arab mistress on the USS Manley and that he was undergoing
Epsychiatric treatment. VAN VOORST was informed that PICARD was :
passigned to Zanzibar on an excellent record; that he was not an f
:aicoholic, although they understood he drank more than an i
-paverage officer would, but his performance was good. They drew i
gattention to PICARD's success in negotiations re a tracking !
| Station and his handling of Zanzibar's independence. The if
i
i
i
:

evacuation of the lady was justified. - They admitted rumors of
a mistress, and said that PICARD suffered nervous exhaustion as
a result of his Zanzibar. , Cxperiences and: was brought back to

| the Department.

Mr. VAN VOORST said ths ey. element of the story was
PICARD'’s suitability for his Zanzibar assignment. If he hada | 4
good record, subsequent nervous condition was. understandable under i
the circumstances. He said he would report to Mr. BENJAMIN |
BRADLEE (the Newsweek Bureau Chief) whose story this was and ‘
it seemed itzely BRADLEE would drop it. The above is being set &

_ With respect to PICARD's actions in Zanzibar, an
Official informal Limited Official Use communication intended '
for addvessee only from Ambassador WILLIAM LEONHART, indicated : L

that PEJARD conducted himself with courage and spirit; that the
American civilians who were evacuated on the USS Manley were l

 
   

‘full of praise for him; that the. four American newsmen whom he :

liprotected on 1/15 and 16/64 spoke with admiration for his efforts.

[;PICARD was clearly not making responsible decisions during these

five days bit LEONHART did net believe any real damage to our VD
interests resulted. In another communication, LEONHART said

PICARD made the right decision at, the right time.

. : PICARD's security file contained a memo of conversation
> dated 3/14/64, between PICARD and JGSEPH PALMER, II, Director }
General of the Foreign Service. |The conversation occurred on ; af

3/12/64. ‘Mr. PALMER told PICARD that Department wished to be

entirely fair with him in investigating and passing judgment on = 4
- the questions which had been raised about his conduct and behavior; i
_that PICARD was complicating his own case by recent activities Ff
such as the involvement in the GOLDSTEIN case and several reports ;
. of his drinking. Mr. PALMER urged PICARD to return to the hospital :
' for further observation and psychiatric care, PICARD said he ;
‘would not go to the hospital since he felt it degrading; that \
his own psychiatrist, a Dr. RUBIN, thought he was making progress |
and did not regard further ho pitalization as necessary. He i
claimed he was purely a victim of circumstances in connection i
with the GOLDSTEIN affair. He admitted he had been drinking ;
:fairly heavily, was under heavy strain. He made clear his i
ixvesentment of not getting any recognition for his performance i
i
4

 

@ during Zanzibar events. The memo indicated that PALMER had the
j impression of PICARD as a sick man who was undergoing great

| psychological stresses and strains; that PICARD's bitterness oy
& at Department's lack of recognition in his performance during |) : F
jj the Zanzibar evacuation seemed to. color his entire attitude.

SOT rena

. On 12/11/44, PICARD's Foreign Service Record indicated —
fhe applied on 3/29/55 for Russian language and area training.
i He noted that he had been studying Russian with the assistance :
