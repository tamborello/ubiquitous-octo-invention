primary goals in the Criminal Intelligence Program is the fuli
identification and subsequent prosecution of the menbership of
‘La Cosa Nestra (LCN), the dominant group in organized crime
in this country. ith an ever-increasing public awareness of
the significance of LCN on a national basis and in consideration
of the Bureau’s vast responsibilities in the field of organized
crime, it is necesmry that complete intelligence be developed
‘regarding LCN.

 

A review of progress reported in the identification
of LCH members reveals that a substantial nuaber have been
identified. Your office has reported that at the present time |

a

 

118 members of LCN reside in your territory. As you know,
New Jersey is 2 major stronghold ef LCN operations. . Therefore, >
your office has heavy responsibilities in the organized crime aN
field. There currentiy exists an urgent need for identification SO
of additional LCN meabers in your territory. Aithough as noted vy
