WARREN COMMISSION REPORT ~~ Pe Ney pecommenclatiens
as_state( tn Pre anda Netes issue t 22, Sepc

1. The long awaited Warren Commission Report, on its exhausive
investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy on November
22, 1963 and the subsequent murder of Lee Oswald by Jack Ruby, will be
sent to the White House on Thursday September 24th and will probably be
released sometime over the weekend. The Department of State is air pouch-
ing copies of the Report (based on some 20 volumes of hearings) to posts
for selective presentation (upon formal release) to “editors, jurists,
Government officials, other opinion-leaders" after the formal release. .
(See attachment, State Circular 505, 19 September 1964, joint State-USIA
message, with list of recipients). Copies of this Government Printing
Office edition will be sent to field stations from headquarters.

2. Reports from around the world indicate that there is a strong —

belief in many countries that the assassination of the President was the

== result of a “political plot"; the unwarranted interpretation that Ruby's

: murder of Oswald was committed to prevent Oswald from revealing the pur-

ported conspiracy adds to this belief. Commmist regimes have used both

murders to denigrate American society and the release of the Report will
undoubtedly be used as a new peg for the same purpose.

3. Covert assets should explain the tragedy wherever it is genuinely
misunderstood and counter all efforts to misconstrue it intentionally --
provided the depth of impact warrants such action. Communists and other
extremists always attempt to prove a political conspiracy behind violence.
In countries accustomed to assassination by political conspiracy, American
dedication to institutions of law and government with stable adwinistrative
procedures can be described; and American Presidents can be shown to have
been the victims (with the exception of Lincoln) of single, fanatical indi-
viduais.

4, Three commercial editions will be published as soon as possible
after the formal release. KUWOLI/PROP has ordered 150 of Bantam's publi-
eation but will evaluate the introductions of all three and inform operat-
ing Divisions of any drawbacks. Divisionsyshould make bulk purchases for
field use through regular channels.
