Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Act of 1992 (the Act)
Synopsis: Detroit is requested to check indices regarding
Detroit files 92-447 and 92-438 Sub 2 to determine if there are
corresponding Headquarters file numbers for-each file.

Details: Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act of 1992 (JFKARCA) any material considered
assassination records must be made available to the National
O Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original
form. In processing these records for release, the JFK Task
Force (JFKTF) must consider these documents in their entirety.

A number of the original documents contained in Detroit
files 92-447 (subject: Lawrence Thomas Phillip McHugh) and 92-438
Sub 2 (subject: Vito Giacalone) have information that has been
blacked out. The JFKTF is charged with determining the content
of that information if possible. The JFKTF is attempting to
locate Headquarters files corresponding to the two Detroit files
listed above. . Headquarters is unable to search for corresponding
Headquarters file numbers for field files without going through
the field office itself. Therefore, the JFKTF requests Detroit
to search the relevant indices and determine the corresponding
Headquarters file numbers. :
