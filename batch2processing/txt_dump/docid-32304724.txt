. SIDNBY RIGELHAUPT with Assistant County Prosecutor WILLIAM HOUSER,

. Mahoning Co. Prosecutor's Office, at which time prosecution of the
8 indictments secured by the Mahoning County GJ for gambling -

_ violations, was discussed, In view of the present crowded condition
of the civil and criminal. docket, it was felt that prosecution of —
these cases could not: begin before 5/18/64, This date has been i
tentatively set for the trial of RONALD DAVID CARABBIA. It was 3

» agreed that of those persons indicted, it was most important that |. -
@ successful prosecution be’ obtained against CARABBIA, With this “

an mind, it was felt that if one. or more of the persons of lesser

- importance, such as STBPHEN ALMASY, MICHAEL:S. GRANCHAY,. or. RICHARD

'. MARZETTI, would. tender a plea of guilty to the felony of promoting

the numbers with the tacit understanding. that he would receive a

Buspended jail ‘sentence and 5 year period of probation,’ such plea.

would be..accepted by Judge RIGELHAUPT, Once convicted. and on —

‘probation, Judge RIGRLHAUPT stated he would be agreeable to’ having

; ‘them’ subpoenaed as witnesses. for the-prosécution in the CARABBIA
. , CaBe. ” Both GAUL and GRANCHAY have previously furnished Bigned .
“Statements to Bureau Agents: admitting their participation in’ the
' CARABBIA numbers business, but at best, they would be reluctant -
: "witnesses. It is hoped, that in this way some measure of coercion.
i Can be applied to induce them to bé cooperative Witnesses, BENNIE

~~... @xereised to. insure that defense. counsel for CARABBIA will not be-

et “able to: use this procedure to their advantage by raising the

ti o>." Issue. of false testimony elecited by promises of light treatment ©

Boe es by the. Prosecutor's Office, however, despite. this hazard, it is.
