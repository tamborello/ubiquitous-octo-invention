:DL 175A-109

 

MILLINGTON fagain place the Bureau in the dilemma of being
presente acts 25 years after the event that can neither be
confirmed nor discounted. Dallas is of the opinion that no
additional investigation in this matter is warranted, in view
of the fact that this subsequent investigation was initiated
. based on statements made by MARCELLO while in a semi-coherent

state and that these statements were subsequently denied by

MARCELLO when interviewed. In addition, volume upon volume of

investigation has previously been conducted by the Bureau, as
“well as various Congressional sub-committees, and none of

these investigations has ever established a positive
connection between MARCELLO and the assassination. Any
further pursuit of this investigation will merely give
appearance of self-doubt regarding the original and. subsequent

investigations. Accordingly, UACB, Dallas is closing DL 89-43

(the original KENNEDY assassination), as well as the current

investigation (DL 175A-109) relating to captioned matter.

ue should be noted that( the above allegations v(d)

During the past eleven months, Dallas has conducted
an extensive review of the original assassination
investigation (DL 89-43) for information of additional lead
value. In addition, extensive outside reading of articles,
publications, books, and government reports were reviewed
prior to the interview of CARLOS MARCELLO on 9/6/89. Nothing
in any Bureau report has provided any reasonable indication of
MARCELLO’S involvement in the captioned assassination, or that
he assisted OSWALD in the assassination. There have been
numerous outside publications theorizing a connection between
MARCELLO and the assassination, but none of these theories has
been able to provide substantive proof of MARCELLO’S
involvement. MARCELLO was interviewed by Buagents on 9/6/89
at the FEDERAL MEDICAL CENTER (FMC), Rochester, Minnesota,
regarding his statements on 2/27/89 that he was "going to get
KENNEDY when he came to Dallas". As expected, MARCELLO denied
making these statements, as well as denying any involvement in
the assassination of President KENNEDY. MARCELLO denied

knowing OSWALD or OSWALD’S uncle, DUTCH MURRET. MARCELLO also
denied knowing EDWARD BECKER, or making a statement to BECKER
in 1962 about having President KENNEDY killed.

It was the opinion of the agents conducting the

interview of MARCELLO that he was clear and lucid at the time

' of the interview, although he would, at times, ramble in a
disoriented manner, apparently attempting to' get the interview
off track. Employees at the FMC confirmed MARCELLO would at
times feign being disoriented for his own personal
convenience, but that at other times, he would legitimately be
‘disoriented. Based on this information, it would appear that
MARCELLO was legitimately disoriented on 2/27/89, thus making
the veracity of his statements suspect. :

Coincidental to the statements by MARCELLO on
2/27/89, the New Orleans Division advised by teletype dated
3/15/89 that the former Chief of Police and current City
Councilman of New Orleans, JOSEPH GIARRUSO, had received a
phone call from an unidentified female caller with a British : o
‘accent. The caller claimed to have worked part time for an
attorney in New Orleans for a period of two days some time
between 1966 and 1968. This caller refused to identify
herself, but did provide a telephone number in England. The -
caller advised GIARRUSO that she remembered typing a letter
for the lawyer and that in the letter money was sent to the
mother of LEE HARVEY OSWALD and that a statement was made in
the letter concerning the KENNEDY assassination. =

. By airtel dated 9/20/89 Legat, London, advised that
DEBORAH MILLINGTON had been interviewed at. Brighton, England,
on 8/31/89, by representatives of NEW-SCOTLAND YARD.
MILLINGTON admitted to being the individual who had called
GIARRUSO in March of 1989. MILLINGTON provided a description
of the attorney for whom she had worked, as well as the :
general location of his office. MILLINGTON claims to have
been interviewed as a potential witness in the trial of CLAY
SHAW. The New Orleans Division, by airtel dated 10/3/89,
advised they had no information regarding MILLINGTON’S status
as a witness in the CLAY SHAW trial, nor did the information
she had provided concerning the location of the attorney’s A\
office coincide with the details provided in her inervlee(Q))
