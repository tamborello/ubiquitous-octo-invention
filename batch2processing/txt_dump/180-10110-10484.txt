Later that same day Sac Shanklin “informed the Director

whe eae,

that the tape of Oswald’s voice had been erased: "It
should be noted that the actual tape from which this

transcript was made has b2en erased." (Teletype from

SAC Dallas to Director, # 232220, 7:30 P.M. CST,. 11/23/63.
Emphasis in the original.)

The confusion about whether or not there was a tape
‘apparently continued for several days after the SAC in
; Dallas ‘informed the Director that such a tape did not
g exist. On 11/25/63 the FBI Legat in Mexico City sent a

Cablegram to the director which said: ,
@ There appears to be some confusion in that no
tapes were taken to Lallas but only typewritten
_ transcripts supplied by CIA, the tapes not being
fi available because they had been erased.

(Cablegram # 182 & 183, ‘F- 2.)

The FBI was asked to explain the paragraph from the’

| ; Hoover memorandum quoted above. It responded:

F
j

The paragraph appearing on pages 4 and 5 of the
leterhead memorandum, which is quoted in your
(FBI) request of March 17, 1978, contains some
incorrect informatior regarding a tape recording
of the voice of an irdividual who identified him-
self as Lee Oswald. :

Retrievable information contained in files

of the FBI indicates that this Bureau received
information derived jrom transcripts of tape
recordings furnished by another government
agency which conducts. intelligence. ype. 3 inves~

: : tigations. The transcripts indicated that on

{ : September 28, 1963, and October 1, 1963, the

! voice of an individual identifying himself as

: Lee Oswald was recorded by the other govern-
ment agency conducting intelligence type inves-.
tigations. Additionally, this government agency
provided the FBI with photographs of an individ-
ual who appeared to be an American; these photo-
graphs being taken by said agency on October 1,
1963. ;

 

i . It is noted that the FBI never received the
i actual tape recordings from which the transcripts
. were derived,.as the tapes were erased by the
other government agency providing the transcripts....

As a result, no FBI employee ever listened to a
tape recording purporting to contain Lee Harvey
Oswald's. voice as no tape was ever provided to

this Bureau. .

ADDENDUM TO FOOTNOTE # 614 OF "LEE HARVEY OSWALD, THE CIA.
AND MEXICO CITY.

Some controversy has arisen in regard to the question

_of whether the tapes existed at the time of the assass-

ination due to a memorandum from J. Edgar Hoover to the
head of the Secret Service which said:

The Central Intelligence Agency advised that
on October 1, 1963, an extremely sensitive
source had reported that an individual iden-

_ tified himself as Lee Oswald, who contacted the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring as to
any messages. Special Agents of this Bureau, |
who have conversed with Oswald in Dallas,
Texas, have observed photographs of the indi-
vidual referred to akove and have listened to
a recording of his vcice. These Special Agents

"are of the opinion that the above-referred-to
individual was not Lee Harvey Oswald.

(Memorandum from Hoover to James J. Rowley, 11/23/63,

Pp. 4-5.) The HSCA has determined that this statement

was probably. based on ancther FBI memorandum which said:

Inasmuch as the Dallas Agents who. listened.to the
‘tape of the conversation allegedly of Oswald

from the Cuban Embassy to the Russian Embassy in
Mexico and examined the photographs of the visitor
to the Embassy in Mexico and were of the opinion .
that neither the tape nor the photograph pertained
to Oswald, I requested Shanklin to immediately
send a photograph of Oswald to our Legal Attache.

(Memorandum from Belmont to Tolson, 11/23/63, p. 1. Mr.

u

Belmont was. reporting the results of a conversation with.

the Special Agent in Charge in Dallas, Gordon Shanklin,
