to influence events in foreign countries which is so designed

 

that, if discovered, official U.S. government participation

What is the legal authority for the CIA to conduct covert
actions? This paper is one of a series that will attempt to
answer.the question. It will first examine the predecessor

agencies to the CIA in order that the establishment of the

 

CIA may be placed in historical perspective. Next, it will
set out the legislative history of the National Security Act
of 1947, the basic charter of the CIA, and the National
Security Council directives which instructed the CIA to con-
duct various forms of covert action. Finally, it will present
uw legal analysis of the 1947 Act. Other papers in the series
will cxamine the impact on the CIA's authority to conduct

covert action of Congressional provision of funds of the CIA,
