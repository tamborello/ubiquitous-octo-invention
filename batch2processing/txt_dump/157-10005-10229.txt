York, a journalist?

Mr. Hunt. No.

Mr. Liebengood. Are you aware of any Agency interest
during the time you had left the Agency and was with Mullen
and the White House, of any Agency interest in Robert Vesco
and his activities?

Mr. Hunt. No.

Mr. Liebengood. Were you ever asked to coordinate any
White House interest in Robert Vesco with the Agency?

Mr. Hunt. No.

Mr. Liebengood. Do you remember how you happened to get

aumamyor when you were talking with him, because

 

of any security work?

Mr. Hunt. How did I get in touch with him. I wrote him.
And those letters are a matter of record.

Mr. Liebengood. I know we've been over the ground about
when your contact with him was. There was some information

to indicate that Charles Kane had suggested that you get ahold

run into somebody on the street in Georgetown, a mutual friend,
some weeks before who by coincidence happened to say, oh, I
saw Manny Gunn the other day. He's retired and practicing out
in Maryland. And that has got to be it because he was not an
intimate of mine. We didn't keep in close touch. So I never
attempted to get in touch with him at the Agency. I simply
looked him up or called information or something like that,
invited him into lunch and said I had a matter I wanted to ;
discuss with him.

Mr. Liebengood. Did you ever tell anybody or otherwise
make known to anybody at the Agency that you had just had this

contact with Dr. Gunn?

   

Mr. Hunt. I don't believe so. I think §S@MeMEEIghay
have known about it subsequently because he was a close friend,

but Ivdon't think that I got in touch with Manny through him.

   

Of .course Mamewas retired, too.

Mr. Liebengood. Would you have told

 

maimpeabout this or

would Gunn have told him about it?

   

Mr. Hunt. I£ in factige m knew about it?

Mr. Liebengood. Yes.

Mr. Hunt. I would have to say it was either Gunn or
Liddy.

Mr. Liebengood. Did you make any arrangements or have any

discussions with Dr. Gunn about maintaining the confidentiality

of your inquiry?

this before, but I can't recall where.

Mr. Liebengood. Was it Robert Kennedy?

Mr. Hunt. No, the death of John Kennedy. She had been
introduced to me by Martinez who brought her to my hotel room.
He provided the tape recorder for our discussion. He did not
help.me translate it because I don't need help. I did that
back in the White House, and I was assisted to some extent by

Mary Kiyonaga, who is the daughter of Sh

 

happened to be in the office next to mine. In any event,

this is a raw report. The woman's. bona fides were established
solely

Rolando Martinez, who we determined later was on the CIA

payroll at that time, although I did not know it. I provided

a raw report and submitted it to the Chief of the WH division.

Mr. Liebengood. Did you ever get any feedback from that
report?

Mr. Hunt. None. Oh, I gave a copy to Charles Colson.

Mr. Liebengood. The same affidavit suggests, and there i
supporting information that in addition to the information for
WH, the transmittals to Dr. Malloy, that there was, I think th
wording in the affidavit says gossip information passed on to
Richard Helms.

Do -you rémember using that: channeél:-to communicate with Ri
Helms in any fashion?

Mr. Hunt. No, at no time.

Mr. Liebengood. Do you know Mr. Charles Wylie in New
