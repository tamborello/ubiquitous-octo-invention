Mr. David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Assassination Records
Review Board

600 E Street, NW

Washington, DC 20530

Dear David:

This is in response to your letter of November 8, 1995
in which you conveyed the request of the Assassination
Records Review Board to be provided access to “any and all
internal CIA histories or retrospective studies or reports”
on several topics.

We have begun to identify histories and other items
that would meet the Board's request. The CIA Historian is
assisting in. this effort.

I suggest that we discuss with you or your staff the
possibility of modifying the request somewhat. Several of
the items mentioned in your letter cover a broad range of
topics. It would be helpful, for example, if the pertinent
historical time period for each item were specified, as well
as what topics in the requested items would be of interest
to the Board. This would assist us in excluding sensitive
information that the Board would regard as non-relevant to
the assassination or to the scope of the investigation.

Given the sensitivity of some of the materials
requested, we would prefer that you designate one or two
people to review the histories and other items in our
offices.

Please let me know your views on the above suggestions.
We appreciate the constructive efforts that you and your
colleagues have made over the past year to work out reasonable,
secure ways of handling documents. For our part, we are
committed to being as responsive as possible to the Board's
interests.

Sincerely,
uy OP .
