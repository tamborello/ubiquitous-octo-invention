AMBASSADOR REPORTS SOVIET REACTION TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S
ASSASSINATION . '

29 Nov 63

=

In reference ta ‘the repekcussions in the Soviet Union to
the assassination of ‘President  eaiaiainia

Basing the finest on personal judgment and the rest on infor-
mation from reliable. diplomatic scurces, I will discuss the following
evaluations: : .

The deep grief produced ‘here by’.the above-mentioned assassina-
tion was absolutely spontaneousand due _to the high culture of
the Soviet people which enables ’.them rise above world
actions as well as to the’ ‘traditional Ruggian sentimentality.

As soon as the news was known, “and in, the face of possible
international complications, the military authorities intensified
security measures which have now returned to. Rorma 1.

High Soviet officials are prapeebict with’ the stand the
new President of the United States may take:on ‘everything: regarding
Cuba, and, although MIKOYAN seemed to have. been ‘(B val impressed)
after speaking with the President and other‘ high-ranking United States
officials, they: are moderately calm. Soviet. leaders will wait
to learn how the matters of the purchase of whéat, will be ‘settled
in the United States as well as the reaching new. t, Sy -Soviet cultural
agreement, for the purpose of gaining a clearer idea Of the policy
in question, . :
