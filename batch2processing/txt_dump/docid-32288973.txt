Sheriff's Office, reflected that one MANUEL ERNESTO VALDEZ
having address.3718 McBerry, had been arrested March 31,

1963 for. possession Of lottery. and. conducting a lottery and
at the time of arrest he had.listed his date of birth as
June 17, 1924 at Havana, Cuba. Records further reflect on
January 25, 1965 this individual had been placed on 2 years
probation after originally having been sentenced on May 20,
1963 to serve one year in jail;

On ‘June 8, 1966 TP T-3 viewed a photograph of ART
PRICE, also knpwn as ARTURO MISURACA..and stated does not
associate this individual: with ‘SANTO. TRAFFICANTE and to his*
knowledge has never heard any of SANTO TRAFFICANTE's associates
speak of ART PRICE; ,

On May 25, 1966 TP T-8 advised that although he
is of. Italian descent and: his family originally came from
Sicily, it ‘so happens that his. family isthe only family:
from a-particular,section of Sicily and is not from the part
of Sicily where.'the TRAFFICANTE's originated. TP T-8 stated”
that several years ago he had: been a’member of the Italian
Club: in Tampa and had become. a ‘very close personal friend of
SANTO TRAFFICANTE, TP. T-8 stated that he was so. friendly
that SANTO: had at. one: time offered to underwrite all‘ of :
TP T-8's medical: expenses in ‘connection with: an operation -

which he, TP’T-8, -had had. TP, T-8 stated. he always considered
‘SANTO TRAFFICANTE as an individual on whose words you could ©

rely and although he has'heard many times that: TRAFFICANTE

is engaged in. gambling operations ‘he has no personal knowledge
concerning any. such activity. TP T-8 stated that. he had
never heard the name La: Cosa Nostra until about 3 years ago
but of course heard on many occasions of the. "black: hand",

TP T-8 stated that; he had heard of the “black hand" prior. to
coming to Tampa but has no specific information concerning
the organization and could not swear that, TRAFFICANTE was
ever a ‘member of the “black hand".
