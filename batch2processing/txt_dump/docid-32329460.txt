coffee shop, got FERRELL and YORK, and confronted them with
OSTRANDER’s. claim concerning the $300,000. FERRELL and YORK
explained to ROCCO the circumstances under which the commission
was to be paid. OSTRANDER originally introduced YORK to one
BUCKLEY, who is in the insurance business in Chicago and
whose son is the God-son of the chairman of the board of
George W. Fuller Company. BUCKLEY prevailed upon his son's
Godfather to agree to construct the Denver project and to
pay the commission. YORK felt the commission shouH be split
three ways. BUCKLEY was to receive $100,000, OSTRANDER to
receive $100,000; and the remaining $100,000 to be split
three wyas between YORK, FERRELL, and ROCCO. When ROCCO
heard this he became’ incensed and said OSTRANDER would not
receive one cent of the commission because he had failed

to pay informant his heretofore agreed to engineering fees.
te said he would talk "to the man" (ALDERISIO) in STEIN's
office and take them all out of it.. ROCCO's cut of: the
commission then became $100,000 and informant became a
"“partnet" with ROCCO.

. On September 6,.1965, JOE STEIN and OSTRANDER insisted
that informant meet with them and he did so, at the Water Tower
Inn. STEIN asked informant what ROCCO had said about the
$300,000 commission. STEIN became very upset and called ROCCO
on the telephone in front of the informant. STEIN told
ROCCO he and "PHILLY''’ (ALDERISIO) were coming right out to
Se@ThimiG STEIN departed presumably to see ROCCO with
ALDERISIO at the Sahara North. . mo

On September 8, 1965, OSTRANDER told informant,
ALDERISIO and STEIN did go to see ROCCO on September 9,
1965, and when they returned from this: meeting ALDERISIO
said STEIN's: office was not going to participate in the
$300 ,000 commission.

. In addition to the foregoing, ROCCO on his first
meeting with informant said he “would get a hold of JIMMY

CATUARA and have him handle that SOB GUIDO FIDANZI once and
for all." © -

On September 2, 1965, CG T-3 advised SA ROBERT L.
MALONE he received a telephone call at his hone in Toledo,
Ohio, on August 31, 1965, from CHARLES YORK, former Mascoutah,
Illinois, banker currently connected with JOSEPH STEIN, First
National Mortgage Company, 645 North Michigan, Chicago,
Illinois. YORK told informant he and ROBERT FERRELL, also
connected with First National Mortgage Company, that they would
fly to Toledo to discuss a business proposition. On September
1, 1965, YORK and FERRELL arrived in Toledo and both told informant
they represented some people who have a lot of money to
invest and that their principals are putting some of their money
into the construction. of a condominium high-rise apartment
building they plan to build on Sheridan Road near Loyola
University, Chicago, Illinois. They asked informaat if he
would be willing to participate in this project to the extent
of doing the preliminary engineering work and to help
secure a contractor to build the condominiun. They asked him
to come to Chicago with them in order.to meet their principals,
which he agreed to do. On the same date informant flew into
Chicago with YORK and FERRELL. They took him to the Sahara
North Motel and while en route they told him their principals
were highly placed members of the Chicago crime "syndicate"
and he was going to be introduced to "TEETS" BATTAGLIA's right
hand man, an individual more powerful.in the "outfit" than
FELIX ALDERISIO. Upon arrival at the Sahara North informant
was introduced to one JOE ZAY (PH) and a TONY ROCCO. ZAY told
informant he and three unnamed associates planned to finance
the erection of the aforementioned condominium as well as a
building complex and shopping center to be built at a
proposed interchange where Milwaukee Avenue meets the Tri- |
State Tohlway. ZAY asked informant to do the preliminary .
engineering and to get RAY HARRINGTON, Shamrock Construction
Company, Gary, Indiana, to agree to construct these projects,
Informant told ZAY about the problems he had had in the past
with people like GUIDO FIDANZI, HARVEY POWERS, GUS RUBINO,
and others. ZAY told informant not to worry about these
people as he would get them off informant's back. Informant
agreed to meet with ZAY again on September 3, 1965.

On September 6, 1965, informant advised as follows:

On Friday, September 3, 1965, he took UAL flight ~
number 727 from Toledo, Ohio, to Chicago, arriving O'Hare
Field 7:12 PM, CDT. He was met by CHARLES YORK at 7:45
PM and driven in his 1961 four door Pontiac to the Sahara
North Motel, where they were met by Mr. and Mrs. ROBERT
FERRELL. At about 8:20 PM they were joined by a man intro-
duced as JOEY FERRARO (PH), said to be the manager of the
Sahara North and a partner of JOE ZAY for 50 years.

At about 8:25 PM the above were joined by ZAY and
his associate, LOU VERIVE (PH). At this time ZAY told
informant that his three associates in the building projects
above are JOEY FERRARO, TONY RICCO, and LOU VERIVE.

In about an hour ZAY, who has been identified as

JOE ROCCO, invited informant to meet with him privately in
Room number 217, where it was evident to informant by the
clothing, photographs, and other personal effects there,
ROCCO permanently resides or frequently stays. At this
meeting ‘ROCCO quizzed informant intently as to his past
associations with GUIDO FIDANZI, HARVEY POWER, BOB FERRELL
and YORK. He further wanted to know about the progress made
to date on the Denver Towerland project. ROCCO then told
informant that informant would be his partner if he made
money on the Denver project first, He further advised that
this would afford informant protection from.then on from
anyone "especially from nobodies like GUIDO."' He further ,
confided that he and his-associates had an "in" with the
George W.-Fuller Company, a very large New York construction
firm and he was going to participate in a $300,000 commission
to be paid by George W. Fuller.Company for having received
the general contract to build the Denver Towerland project.
Informant told ROCCO this was strange inasmuch as ROBERT
OSTRANDER, who works with JOE STEIN at the First National
Mortgage Company, had previously told informant that the
$300 ,000 ‘commission was to be paid to his office. ROCCO

. became upset when he learned this, went downstairs to the
