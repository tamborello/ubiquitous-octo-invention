It is suggested that the following Labyricated story
bo passed to a person with high-level comtacts in Havana:

Te USA is very much disturbed by UN entry
inte the Dominican problem, which sets an adverse
precedent in the Latin American area, heretofore
considered the sacrosanct province of the OAS.

Tne USSR has been jolted by the resolute .
aed rapid action taken by the USA in the Dowd
nicean Rapublic vith the announced objectivo of
gtemsing the tide of Castroism, For the firae
time aince the missile crisia, the USSR has

i seen tangibie indications that the USA is not
averse to invading a Caribbean lslamd. =. : “ .

 

In” view of these prececupations of both the
USA and the USSR, a tacit deal has come about:

==

- (a). Gn its part the USA agroes that
“géetalism" be alloved to exist in Cuba,
but without Fidel Castro, Raul Castro aad
Ceo Guevara; the USA vould bo willing to
aceopt aay other Cubams now ia govoranant
pooitions; the USA ia villing to make
: gsonconcions (undeterained) eloevhkere in
the world.
