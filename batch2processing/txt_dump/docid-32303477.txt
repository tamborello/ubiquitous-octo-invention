NY 100-107383

It is to be noted that to date, the subject's checking
account at the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company, Grove and West
Fourth Streets, NY, NY, does not show that the subject wrote a
check for his ticket to Milan. This, coupled with the fact that
he refused to give Alitalia an address or telephone number where
he could be reached, seems to indicate that he did not want his
trip to Europe to become known.

The Bureau is requested, through Legat, Rome, to determine,
if possible, the subject's activities in Milan, Italy. Iv is also
| requested that it be determined if TANG Ming-chou, also known as
CHU TONG, an official of the People's Republic/fhina, was in Milan
at the same time as the subject (3) ,

It is also requested that the Bureau point out to the
Legat, Rome, that itwwas reliably reported that in September, 1963,
the subject contacted TANG Ming-chou in London, and that it has
also been reported that TANG is in charge of Political Intelligence
for the People's Republic of China as it pertains to Mmglish-speaking
countries.

When the records become available at INS, NY pertaining

to arrivals about 5/19 or 20/64, these records will be reviewed to
: determine subject's method of return to the United States.
