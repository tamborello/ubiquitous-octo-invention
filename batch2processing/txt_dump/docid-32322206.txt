Title: ASSASSINATION MATERIAL DISCLOSURE ACT
Synopsis: JFK Task Force returning file(s) to WFO.

Details: Re WFO EC dated 03/24/1999, one box of records are
being returned. :

The originals removed from these files and, in some
cases, replaced with duplicate copies of the original were
accessioned to the National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA) pursuant to the JFK Records Collection Act of 1992.
Provision of the JFK Act allowed for certain information to be
postponed from public release until the year 2017; therefore, the
pages have NOT necessarily been released for public review in

_their entirety.

Under the JFK Act, originals to all material deemed
assassination records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of

whether the material is open in full or released with information

postponed. Therefore, any documents or pages from FBI files
accessioned to NARA pursuant to the JFK Act are no longer .
considered the possession of the FBI. The duplicate pages have
been inserted strictly for research purposes.

The copies contained within the previously mentioned
file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date
classification.
