at the Patrick Henry Library; TREES virginia. He is

WFO 105-52281

32 years of age, was born in Havana, Cuba, an is married.
He attended the Belen School, Havana, Cuba, from 1939 to
1949, and graduated a Doctor of Law from the University

of Havana School of Law in 1954. From 1954 to 1959, he C
was employed as an attorney with the firm of NUNEZ, MESS

& MACHADO, Havana. From 1959 to 1960, he was in private
law practice. From 1957 to 1960, he was also employed
as an assistant professor and then professor at the
Villanueva University School of Law, Havana, and from
1961 to 1963, he was a professor at the School of Law

of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, Ponce,

Puerto Rico. . ..

On 7-31-64, WF 1414-S (protect - reliable)
advised SAs MIKE G. ZINCK and BURGE that Dr. PEDRO ENTENZA
is the representative of JURE in the Washington, D. C.,;
area, and as such was quite active, although not very
successful, during about April and May, 1964, in attempting
to gain sympathy and financial support for JURE. However,
since the failure of MANUEL RAY to make his much-publicized
entry into Cuba by May 20, 1964, ENTENZA has been much less
active. The informant described ENTENZA as a good
representative of JURE in that his ideas coincide with
those set forth in JURE propaganda, which the informant
considers to be very socialistic.

On 7-31-64, WFCS RAMIRO LOYS (protect - reliable)
advised SAs ZINCK and BURGE the representative of the JURE
in the Washington, D. C., area is PEDRO ENTENZA, but that
since the failure of RAY to make good his promise to be
in Cuba by May 20, 1964, there has been little interest or
activity concerning JURE.
