_7. The addresses of the meetings set forth in the last para-
graph of page 15 and in the first paragraph of page 16 of
the referenced report was the address of DL-2-S and DL-15-+S.
For security reasons, the names and addresses of informants
have never been set forth by me in reports. I do not be-

. lieve it is good security to do this. The address of the

‘ meeting set forth in paragraph l, page 8, of this report
was not furnished to the Dallas Office by the Oklahoma City
Office, possibly for the same reason, The meeting set forth
in paragraph 2, page 13, was held at a Negro YMCA in Dillas,
Texas. The exact address of this, meeting was inadvertantly
left out, and every effort will be made in the future to see
that this does not reocour.(@ iw)
