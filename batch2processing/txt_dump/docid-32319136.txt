The purpose of this note is to inform you of
developments with respect to two confidential source-related
matters being addressed with the Assassination Records Review
Board (ARRB).

Discussions with the ARRB regarding the Bureau's
postponements of confidential source- related information have

respect to each postponement (a position being contemplated by
the Board), we believe that the Board has the discretion to

interpret the legislation in a way that supports the Bureau's
postponements of source-identifying information.

 

(_In various discussions with Board representatives, we
have conveyed the FBI's absolute willingness to accommodate the
public interest in source-identifying information that is of
historical interest./ This would be done by disclosing such
information when’(as was the case with the SOLO source
information) disclosure will not result in harm to individuals or
to our source development capabilities. At the same time, we
have emphasized our commitment to protecting the identities of
confidential sources who could furnish no information pertinent
to the assassination or where, while sources provided "positive"
information, their identities “LAC to the historical
