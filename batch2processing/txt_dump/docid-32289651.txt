Lieutenant ALVAREZ advised that "ACE" could \
furnish no other information other than that set out and was
unable to furnish any additional details regarding this 1nforma~
tion, .

Because of the informant!s position with the
Teamsters Union, the POPR is concerned about protecting his
identity and believes that if the informant's identity were
known, it would be difficult to obtain information of the nature
this informant can furnish,

The letterhead memorandum is being marked "Confi-
dential" in that it enntains information furnished by "ACE",
a confidential informant of the POPR, who is a highly placed
Teamsters official and should his identity become known, it
will destroy his future effectiveness and may endanger his
life.

No local dissemination is being made in that .
such local dissemination couldreasonably result in the identi- |
fication of the aforementioned source,

Careful consideration has been given to the source i
concealed and his identity was concealed only in those instances
where necessary. .

ALVAREZ and information obtained from him will be reported in
