“Jerry P. HENNING, Jxr., Ex-US Marine who served in Cuban

randum is that information contained in paragraphs four
and five of the reference and related by HEMMING voluntarily
to the Contact Division/Los Angeles Office between 11 and _
21 October 1960, to wit: :

: “Henning returned to California in October
. 1958....He left for Cuba by air via Miami on
--or about 18. February 1959 arriving in Havana
on 19 February 1959." —

“He claimed to have contacted officials
“in the Cuban Consul's office in Los Angeles
. Prior to his departure."

3. In substance relative to the above, the HEMMING
file reflects that he served in the U: S. Marine Corps from
19 April 1954 to 17 October 1958. (The 201 file concerning
HEMMING reflects that he served in Japan with a U. S. Marine:
Air Wing.) He then returned to the Los Angeles areca for

_4. The pertinence of the foregoing is that Lee Harvey
OSWALD served with a U. S. Marine Air Wing in Japan, and
when OSWALD returned to the United States, he was assigned
to Santa Anna, California (Los Angeles area). Extensive
testimony contained in the Warren Commission. hearings by
OSWALD's fellow Marines at Santa Anna contain the theme
that. OSWALD was interested in going to Cuba to join Castro
(upon his discharge) in early 1959 and that in early 1959
OSWALD allegedly made some contact. with.the ‘Cuban Consul's
Office in Los Angeles. So

5. The above as well as the Office of Security file
concerning HEMMING which is replete with information. _
possibly. Linking HEMMING and his cohorts to OSWALD was

rought to the attention of Mr. John Leader. (and Mr. Scott
Breclfinridge), Inspector General, on 6 April 1977. Mr. Leader
advised he would pursue the matter. : a
