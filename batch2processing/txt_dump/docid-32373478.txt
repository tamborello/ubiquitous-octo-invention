SUBJECT: OSWALD.contacts with Cuban and Soviet Embassies, Mexico
' City, Mexico, during the period 27 September 1963 to 1.O0ctober
1963 ;

1. ODESSA Calls..

2. OSWALD Calls.
3. Original Transcripts.
FINDINGS:

1. Calls concerning travel. to ODESSA. Three calls were made in
the Spanish language on 27 September 1963 concerning travel to Odessa.
The first call was made about 1040 hours to the Soviet Military Attathe
Office. An unidentified man outside asks the Soviet. Military. Attache
what is needed to get a visa to go to Odessa. The Soviet tells him to
call 15-60-55 and ask for the consul. The man outside asks for the
address which the Soviet provides. 1/ The second call was made about
1037 hours to the Consulate of the Soviet Embassy (15-60-55). An unidentified
man asks for the consul and is told that he is not there. The unidentified
man asks what is needed to get a visa to-go to Odessa and is told to call

' back at 1130 hours. 2/ The third call.occurred at 1235 hours. A man

HW 53217

named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) inside the. Soviet Consulate (15-60-55) called
out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial America, probably a pension or hotel -but
not listed in the telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN | --
ROMAN. ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the Soviets
will also need copies of the passenger manifest. (The conversation suggests
that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN were shipping representatives of the boat
“KALONIA"). 2/ There is nothing in either of the calls to suggest any
connection with OSWALD. There is evidence that the calls were not related
to OSWALD: a) -in OSWALDS's contacts with Cuban and Soviet officials-he made
noe effort to communicate in Spanish though he appéared to have difficulty -
with both English and Russian, thus one concludes that he could not speak
Spanish. All three calls about Odessa were in fluent Spanish. b) Marina
OSWALD in her letter to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. (reproduced in
the Warren”Commission Report)asked specifically to go to Lenningrad and

Made no mention of Odessa.

2. There were five telephone calls to or from the Soviet -
Embassy in Mexico City which (after 22 November 1963) were linked to
a" OSWALD for the period 27 September 1963 to 1 October 1963: .

= a) “Shortly after 1600. hours on 27 September 1963 the Soviet :
a ‘Embassy, Mexico City, received a.call.from Sylvia DURAN, a Mexican: - |
oral Oo employee’ in the Cuban. Consulate, Mexico City. DURAN had a North- ~
oe : : american in her office and wanted to know who he talked with at
, the Sdviet Embassy. She had sent him there for a Soviet visa
after which the Cubans would issue one to him. DURAN was told to
leave a number for someone to return the call. She gave the
Soviets the number of the Cuban Consulate. .3/: .

One coricludes: from this conversation that. this Northamerican, ¢
later identified by DURAN as OSWALD, went first to the Cuban
Embassy on 27 September, then to the Soviet Embassy, and
returned to the Cuban Embassy when DURAN made the first call. )

b) At 1626 hours on 27 September a Soviet male in the Soviet’
Embassy, Mexico City, returned the call to DURAN at the Cuban
Embassy and asked if the Northamerican had been there and was told
that he was still there (at the Cuban Embassy). The Soviet told
DURAN that the Northamerican had shown them letters with their

_ Consulate in Washington requesting a visa for himself and his
-wife but the process takes 4 to 5 months and they (the Soviet

\ Embassy in Mexico) have no authorization to issue a visa to him

oe _ and furthermore they (the Soviet Embassy in Mexico) do not’ know

; : anything about him and cannot give him a letter of recommendation

g : to go to Cuba (enroute to the USSR). ~- DURAN says that in that case _
" he cannot be issued.a visa to Cuba either: (until he ‘réceives fa

permission to go on to the USSR). 4/

c) Shortly before 1200 hours on 28 September 1963 the Soviet
Embassy Consulate, Mexico City, received a call from Sylvia
DURAN who said she had there in "'their'' Consulate, the Northamerican
who had been to the Soviet Embassy. The Northamerican talks with

ves the Soviet in English and Russian saying he was ‘just now" af_your
Embassy and they "took his address" but he didn't know it then and
went back to the Cuban Embassy to get it. “The Soviet tells Him to
come back to the Soviet Embassy. The Northamerican agrees to do so.
right away. 5/

(One concludes from this conversation that OSWALD went to the Soviet
Embassy before 1200 hours on 28 September, then to the Cuban Embassy
where the call was made, then returned to the Soviet Embassy some
time after 1200 hours ‘the same ° day. )

~ : e) ‘At 1035 hours on 1 October. 1963, a man (whose voice was | ~

“ . '_ ‘described by the translator as the same person as above) calléd
the Soviet-Embdassy Consulate. He said this is LEE OSWALD, I was
at your place last Saturday and spoke with a Consul who said they
would ‘send a telegram to Washington, so I-want to find out if -you
have anything. He did not remember the name of the Consul. The
Soviet suggested it was KOSTIKOV, then told the caller that a
telegram had gone out but nothing had been received. 7/ o
