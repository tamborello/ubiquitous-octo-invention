informant related that he knew who "MOONEY" was and who

BRODKIN represents, and further that he, himself, is on a
friendly business basis with PAT CERONE, IRV WEINER, and

ED MORRIS, who are some of the leading bondsmen in the city and .
he is aware that PAT CERONE and IRV WEINER have connections with
the dutfit. He thought because of his association with these
péople his name might have been recommended as a person to
bring in to represent the colored interests on the South Side.
Chicago T-2 said he told BRODKIN that he was getting along all
right with his present companies, but that he was always open,
to a good proposition.

He said after his initial conversation with BRODKIN,
he called FRANK WRIGHT, President, United Bonding Company,
830 East 38th Street, Indianapolis, ‘which company he represents 4
and with whom. he is a close friend. He said WRIGHT told him that
he had heard of. the company which BRODKIN had mentioned to him
and said that the outfit was behind this company in Indianapolis
| where a man named HADLEY was operating it, and that. the company
| was no good. He further stated that a hoodlum in Cleveland also
has the agency for this company there, but he did not know
his name.

Chicago T-2 stated he has given this matter considerable
thought and that knowing that the outfit controls certain judges
and that there are powerful people behind this operation, he
did not feel that he could flatly turn down the invitation. to
join up with this new company, especially when he knew who was
behind it. He said that he had talked to RBRODKIN yesterday
and had told him that he wanted to stay in. business and did not
want any "moth" to grow on him and that he was leaving it up
to him to include him in the new company if he thought it was
a good thing to do. He felt, therefore, that within the next
month or so he very well could be writing bonds for a company
that is apparently being backed by the outfit.

Chicago’ T-2 further remarked that since the bail bond
scandal broke, a new association of bondsmen has been formed with
the purpose of forming certain policies to be followed in the
future in an. effort to eliminate chicanery on part of bondsmen

as well as city officials. Officers in this association
are IRV WEINER, President, ED MORRIS, Secretary, and TONY HORTON
as Treasurer, :

Chicago T-2 believes that since the outfit is behind
this new company they are attempting to freeze out a majority
of the other bondsmen and take over the bonding business in
other larger cities as well. He said that if IRV WEINER, PAT
CERONE, ED MORRIS, and TONY HORTON were to associate themselvés
with the new company, they could sew up ninety per: cent of the
bonding business in Chicago. He further stated that if they had
a majority of the bonding business in five of the larger cities
they would be able to take $15,000 per week out of the business,

Chicago T-2 further inquired as to the present
status of ED and GEORGE JONES, former policy wheel. operators
on the South Side, who are now in Mexico City, Mexico. He
said he wondered about their present connections with the outfit
as he understands when anyone from the syndicate goes to Mexico
he: finds out that generally they have visited with ED JONES
before they return. He further stated that the son of an
Italian hoodlum, whose name he cannot recall, had spent some time
with ED JONES in Mexico. He also advised he had learned that
JONES has been to Switzerland on frequent occasions, but
does not know for what reason. He commented that he is also
on friendly terms with ED JONES and knows his. wife, and they have
been out together socially, and he speculated that if GIANCANA
had been to Mexico he possibly could have been in contact with
JONES, and JONES could have given his name to GIANCANA and
possibly have recommended him in this bail bond venture.

Chicago T-3 advised SAs RALPH R. HILL, Jr., and PAUL

B. FRANKFURT on June 23, 1959, that a new bonding .company

is being formed in Indianapolis, Indiana, named the United
Public Insurance Company, headed by (FNU) SCHLOSS. The General
Manager is JIM (0.J.) HELBURN or HILBURN. Their address is 108
East Washington Street, Indianapolis. Until recently, this
company has engaged almost exclusively in-automobile insurance,
but about a month or two ago, the company applied to the United
States Treasury Department for a Federal Qualification to write
bonds in Federal Courts. The United Public Company.was formed

MISCELLANEOUS

Attempt to Corner Bail Bond Business

On June 17, 1959, Chicago T-2 was interviewed at the
Criminal Court Building, 2600 South California, by SAs WILLIAM
F, ROEMER, Jr., and PAUL B. FRANKFURT.

Chicago T-2 stated he did not know SAM GIANCANA
personally and would not know him if he saw him. He states
he does know him by. reputation. He did not know who had given
his name-to GIANCANA, but thought an explanation for it might
be that ‘at about 10:00 a.m. last Monday, June 15, 1959, he was
stopped in the hall of the Criminal Court Building by MIKE ;
BRODKIN, attorney. BRODKIN stated he understood that.he was not
getting along too well with surety companies he writes bonds
with. He said there was a company coming into town which is out
of Indianapolis and that "MOONEY" was interested in it and MOONEY
had given him his name. He said BRODKIN had mentioned the name
‘of the bonding company he was intérested in. and said it sounded
like United Bonding Company or a name similar to it. The
