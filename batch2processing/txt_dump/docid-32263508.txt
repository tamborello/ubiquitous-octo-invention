Dear Mr. Rhoads:

In conjunction with our investigation into the
circumstances surrounding the death of President Kennedy,
we hereby request the declassification of portions of a
memorandum to be used in our forthcoming hearings,
scheduled to begin on September 6th, 1978.

lids

The document we are requesting partial declassi-
fication of. is the November 24th, 1963 memorandum by President
Johnson's aide, Walter Jenkins, setting forth a phone conver-

sation with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. A copy of the
memorandum is enclosed with this letter.

Most of the memorandum appears to have already

been made public, initially by the Senate Select Committee

on Intelligence in 1976. However, there is a lengthy para-
graph beginning at the bottom of page two of the memorandum

which is still classified as "secret."

We now request that the only portions of the
memorandum that remain classified be limited as follows:

A. All of the last paragraph on page 2,
which continues on to page 3, would
be declassified, except the two sen-
tences: "For instance, Oswald made a
phone call to the Cuban Embassy in
Mexico City which we intercepted.

It was only about a visa, however."

These two sentences could remain classified as

COMMITTEE SENSITIVE

Mr. James B. Rhoads - Page 2 August 29, 1978

We believe that the declassification of the
above portions of the memorandum is essential to our
Committee's investigation, and will not breach the con-
fidentiality of the other segments relating to sources
and methods which we are not now requesting declassification
of.

As our public hearings will begin on September
6th, 1978, we respectfully request your immediate attention
in assisting us with this matter. If you have anv questions
regarding this, please contact.me at 225 2394.

Again, our thanks for your generous assistance
in the past.

‘Sincerely,

Phi Baine
