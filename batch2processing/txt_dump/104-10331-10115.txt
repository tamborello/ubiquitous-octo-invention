From: J. Barry Harrelson, CSI/HRG
Subject: Meeting with ARRB Staff
1. Thursday afternoon I met with Dave Marwell, .

Executive Director for the ARRB, and two of his staff,
Jeremy Gunn and Mary McAuliffe. I briefed them on the four
releases in the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony that chad
been identified as potential appeal items, and on the bo.
Agency's.concerns re the documents. I requested
that the Board reconsider the release of the statements on

Mexico City political action pro iso's comment on
Agee, the reference to en fae. a source and
Cas site of the Agency's Record Center.

2. Marwell agreed to send a “staff recommendation” to
the Board recommending that they delay the release of these
four items to hear additional evidence from the Agency. The
rest of the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony would be
released on schedule. If the Board accepts the staff's
recommendation, the four items will be addressed at the next
Washington meeting (27 September). If the Board rejects the
staff's recommendation, then we have the option of appealing

to the President. Marwell and Gunn seemed confident that
the Board would agree to delay the release.

 

3. Gunn requested that the Agency's additional
evidence on these four items (if provided in writing) be to
tRESARRB staff by 23 September. The Agency can also brief
the Board members at the 27 September meeting. As I
understand it, DO/Mexico | will be preparin

issue. —F

4. Concerning the Jaocument s, Marwell agreed
to delay Board action unti ée-16 October meeting. The
Agency's proposal on these documents should be sent to the
ARRB staff as soon as possible.
