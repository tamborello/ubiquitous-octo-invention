Kennedy Jerome FREDERICK - student, SGWU

FREDERICK, a West Indian, arrived in Canada in August
1967 to attend university at SGuu. ” FREDERICK is a member of the
militant Negro movement at the University and advocates violence.
He is considered by some parties to be extremely dangerous and
capable of drastic actions. He was active in organizing the
occupation or the Computer Center at SGwU and was one of those
arrested during the riot.

Maurice HALPERIN -~ Professor, SFU

‘ HALPERIN was born on 3 March 1906 at Boston, Massachusett
and entered Canada in the spring of 1968. In late 1953 he left the
United States for Mexico in order to avoid testifying before a

Mexican Coverhment began deporting United States Communists, |
HALPsnIN went to the Soviet Union, and became a visiting professor
at the U.5.5.n. Academy of Sciences. He went to Cuba in October

he remained employed until coming to Canada. He is currently
employed with the Faculty of Education, Behavioural Science

Bernard CURKIE lobbied very hard to have HALPERIN accepted by

Of particular interest in this case is the fact that
CURRIE and HALPERIN were associated with the same espionage group
in the United. States. His application for landed status was th
subject of an objection by the RCMP and, as yet, no final decision
AAS been made by tne Minister of Immigrat ion.

Alfred Alan HERZUG - graduate Student, McGill University

HERZOG, a U.S.A. citizen, travelled to several Canadian
university campuses with robert CRUISE, a leader of the Inter-
nationalists (pro-Chinese Communist), in their promotion of the
Canadian Student Movement. He is a member of the Intellectual
and Patriotic workers of Quebec (les Intellectuels et Ouvriers
Patriotes du Quebec = IOPQ), was involved in the occupation of. SGW.
in February 1964 and is a close associate of the leader of the

of the SDU at SFU, consists of left-wing activists! in this
category. Martin LONEY, who was one of the student leaders
during the SFU incident, entered Canada as a British citizen in
August 1966. Dr. Thomas Burton BOTTOMORE , a leading Marxist
and author on Marxism as well as a British citizen, took up
employment at SFU in 1965 as head of the Department of Political
Science, Sociology and Anthropology (PSA). BOTTOMORE, as head of
the PSA, was responsible for the hiring of Kathleen ABERLE, a
British citizen, and of Thomas Harold BROSE, John William Carl
LUNGGEIT, Bathan POPKIN and Martin NICOLAUS, all Ue Se citizens.

: oe “Although the largest concentration of foreign radicals
at SFU was in the PSA, other activists did take positions in
other departments.t fhese included Sidney COONTZ, Michael Allan
LEBOWITZ, Paul Edward IVORY, and Maurice HALPERIN, all U.S.
citizens, and Laughlin Bernard CURRIE, a citisen of Colombia.

Mordécai BRIEMBERG, who took over as head of the PSA
Department after’ BOTTOMORE tendered his resignation in 1967, has
expressed a desire to remain as Department head in order to keep

his hand in on the hiring. In this regard, Gerald SPERLING is, 2—

through BRIEMBERG, making efforts to get Maleolm SYLVERS,.an American
’ Marxist university professor who apparently worked for the Communist
underground in Italy during the early 1960's, into SFU.

Professor Donald E. EPSTEIN of the Political Science
Department at the University of Waterloo, an American citizen :
described as a draft dodger and.an SDS member prior to his arrival
‘in Canada~“in 1967, as previously indicated, has been active in :
organizing and directing students in tactics and methods by which |
, they could take physical possession of university buildings. ;
i EPSTEIN, who has been active in student power activities at
. Waterloo, has apparently been refused tenure at that University

and there are indications that activist students intend to challenge .

i the administration in this regard.

\ oS ‘Professor Norman STRAX, 2 an American who was employed
‘as an Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of New
Brunswick, precipitated the crisis at that University. STRAX was
instrumental] in the formation and activities of the SDS branch at
that point .- ; ; .
