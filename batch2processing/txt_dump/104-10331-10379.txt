~ SUBJECT: JFK - Release by National Archives

{just spoke with Steve Tilly at the Archives. He met with his legal advisors and they agreed to hold awe until
wo go forward with the appeal. However, he warned me that if the Board orders him to release it, then he will have to do so. He will
notify us if that happens. He, of course, told me.that we should make a decision within the next few days since the Board could call him

at any time.

{ am relieved that this problem could be resolved without going to the White House, but Tilly made it cleat that this appeal should go cut
quickly or else the document will be released.
