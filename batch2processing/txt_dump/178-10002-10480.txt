; Mr. FitzGerald pointed out that the penetration of Cuban installations
> were mainly diplomatic installations and that some 14 Cuban diplomats were
our agents. Mr. Clifford asked how the information was gotten Out of Cuba,
and Mr. FitzGerald replied that it was mostly by secret writing transmitted
', to Mexico City by mail and then forwarded to Washington, He said there
were four radios in Cuba and that we now had a greatly improved medium
Speed transmitter that was quite small, the size of about two cigarette cartons, ©
and it could get a message off in just 60 seconds. He said that there was ae oe
smaller and better transmitter currently in the process of development,

Mr. FitzGerald replied that it would not compromise any other agents
except the one apprehended, and the DCI noted that it would simply com-

promise the instrument.

that the 665 reports from resident agents were primarily on military targets
and the intelligence community felt they were really worthwhile as a supple-
ment to overhead reconnaissance. General Doolittle asked if an illegal
team was two men and Mr. FitzGerald replied "yes", Mr. Murphy asked
whether these agents provided information on Soviet troop strength and
equipment, and Mr, FitzGerald replied in the affirmative. Mr. Clifford
