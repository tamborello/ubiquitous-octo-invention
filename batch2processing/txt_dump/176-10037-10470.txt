WE WOULD NOT THINK SOVIETS AT THIS JUNCTURE PREPARED ACCEPT.

my. RE ESTIMATE RECENT INFILTRATIONS WHICH TRUMBULL ATTRIBUTED TO
GVN, THE CIA STATION 1S UNABLE ASCERTAIN WHAT ELEMENT GVN GAVE HIM
FIGURE, BUT TOTAL CONSIDERABLY IN EXCESS WHAT MACV CARRYING. OF
POSSIBLE INTEREST IS FOLLOWING MACV ESTIMATE MONTHLY FLOW
ANF ILTRATIONS FROM JUNE 1961 UNTIL PRESENT: . FROM JUNE TO DEC 1961,
500-1000 PER MONTH; FROM JAN TO APRIL 1962, 100-200 PER MONTH;
MAY AND JUNE, 800-1000, ESTIMATE BASED ON ANALYSIS CERTAIN CIA
REPORTS (MAINLY FROM ARVN G-2 REPRESENTATIVES IN LIAISON AT
SAVANNAKHET WITH FAR G-2), ON-THE-SPOT CONVERSATIONS IN PLEIKU WITH
If CORPS INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS. AND THE MAAG ADVISOR THERE, AND ESTIMATES
GVN JOINT GENERAL STAFF J-2. ALTHOUGH MACV J-2 READILY AGREES HARD
INFO ON SUBJECT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN, ITS ESTIMATE APPARENTLY MADE ONLY —
AFTER CONSIDERABLE STUDY OF PROBLEM AND IS PROBABLY FAR CLOSER TO
TRUTH THAN CONSIDERABLY HIGHER GVN ESTIMATES."
CIA HEADQUARTERS COMMENT:

WE BELIEVE THE FIGURES USED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES ARE GROSSLY

EXAGGERATED THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF INCREASING INFILTRATION
SINCE EARLY MAY. EVEN THESE REPORTS ARE TENUOUS ALTHOUGH THEY DO

SUGGEST SOME MOVEMENT IS TAKING PLACE ALONG THE TRAILS, THERE HAS

PAGE 3 OF 4
BEEN NO CONFIRMATION THAT NORTH VIETNAMESE TROOPS HAVE BEGUN WITHDRAWING
FROM. LAOS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THERE WILL BE SOME COVERT WITHDRAWAL OF
NORTH VIETNAMESE FROM LAOS FOLLOWING AN AGREEMENT AT GENEVA AND THAT
INFILTRATION INTO SOUTH VIETNAM PROBABLY WILL BE ACCELERATED, WE DO NOT
THINK THAT THE BULK OF NORTH VIETNAMESE IN LAOS WOULD BE TRANSFERRED

TO SOUTH VIETNAM, PAST EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THE NORTH VIETNAMESE
NORMALLY PUT INFILTRATORS THROUGH SPECIAL TRAINING AND INDOCTRINATION

BEFORE SENDING THEM SOUTH,

Mr. President: oe

The attached message from CIA sums up very well the whole
- Laao-South Vietnam infiltration problem whith I mentioned to you
briefly yesterday. . ‘ :

As I told you, the military on the spot (General Harkins) and
State agree with these estimates, They also agree in denying that
‘either of them was responsible for the backgrounder that produced

the story. However, it is clear from paragraph one of this
message that some American in the Kontum area did talk to the
UPI correspondent. Both the military and State now realize very
well that this is the kind of thing they better not do again.

ATTN: MR, KAYSEN
THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE FROM CIA STATION IN SAIGON RECEIVED IN
WASHINGTON AS IN 23562 1S IN RESPONSE TO THE REQUEST MADE ON 4 JULY
BY MR. KAYSEN TO MR. FENDIG OF CIA CONCERNING THE TRUMBULL STORY IN
4 JULY NEW YORK TIMES:

"|, THE CIA STATION, SAIGON, HAS MADE EXTENSIVE CHECK IN EFFORT
DISCOVER SOURCES OF FIGURES AND: INSPIRATION FOR SPECULATIONS IN TRUMBULL
ARTICLE, BUT ALL WE HAVE: ABLE FIND OUT WAS THAT FIGURE OF 8,000 TO
9,000 RECENT INFILTRATORS ORIGINALLY FILED BY UPI CORRESPONDENT ON.
BASIS BRIEFINGS He RECEIVED FROM UNIDENTIFIED SOURCES JN KONTUM DURING
RECENT VISIT. TRUMBULL PRESUMABLY PICKED UP FIGURE FROM -UPI- REPORT,
TIED IT IN WITH HIS OWN PRECONCEPTIONS TO FASHION WHAT SEEMS TO US A
HIGHLY EXAGGERATED AND SPECULATIVE REPORT.

"2, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE INDICATION FROM INFO AVAILABLE TO US

HERE THAT TO DATE THERE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ANY MASS TRANSFER OF PAVN

ELEMENTS FROM LAOS TO SOUTH VIETNAM; ALTHOUGH THIS ALWAYS POSSIBILITY ~
AND 1S OF COURSE SOURCE SERIOUS CONCERN GVN, SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT
BULK OF PAVN ELEMENTS ACCEPTED AS BEING CURRENTLY DEPLOYED IN LAOS ARE
BELIEVED BE LOCATED EITHER ALONG ROUTE 7-OR IN NORTHERN LAOS,
THEIR REDEPLOYMENT INTO SOUTH VIETNAM WOULD SEEM POSE AT LEAST AS MANY
DIFFICULTIES AS INFILTRATION FRESH ELEMENTS DIRECTLY FROM NORTH VIETNAM ”
_ VIA LAOS.» MOREOVER MOST THESE UNITS PROBABLY COMPOSED NORTHERNERS,
WHO WHILE PERHAPS SUITABLE FOR OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN LAOS WOULD BE
FAR LESS SUITABLE FOR SOUTH VIETNAM THAN LARGE POOL REGROUPED SOUTHERNERS
MANY OF WHOM INCORPORATED INTO 305TH, 324TH AND 338TH DIVISIONS.

"3, RE TRUMBULL'S SPECULATION ON "REPORTED PLAN" FOR "LIBERATED
AREA," THIS OF COURSE SOMETHING WHICH MAY EVENTUALLY MATERIALIZE;
HOWEVER, HANOI'S CURRENT PROPAGANDA STANCE CONTAINS NO HINT OF EARLY
ESTABLISHMENT RIVAL GOVERNMENT IN SOUTH NOR 1S THERE ANY SUGGESTION
OF THIS IN OTHER REPORTING ON SUBJECT. STATION INCLINED THINK EARLY
MOVE THIS DIRECTION WOULD BE ILL-TIMED FROM COMMIE STANDPOINT,

COMING AS IT WOULD ON HEELS OF ICC DECISION ON SUBVERSION,

ESTABLISHMENT OF LAOS COALITION AND IMPENDING 14-NATION GENEVA

AGREEMENT ON LAOS. QUESTION SETTING UP RIVAL GOVT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN

SUBJECT CONVERSATION BETWEEN HO CHI MINH AND RUSSIANS AT MOSCOW,

BUT WE TEND TO QOUBT RUSSIANS WOULD BE VERY KEEN ON ITS EARLY

ESTABLISHMENT SINCE IT WOULD VIRTUALLY FORCE THEM PROVIDE OPEN AID TO
