NEUTRALITY MATTERS om Dae 5 UNG

Reference is made to our memorandum to you of February 8,
1961, captioned as above, and to your memoranda to the Attorney
General dated June 30, 1961 and to this Division » dated July 6,
1961, on neutrality matters.

The Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency
has advised this Division that CIA has no current interest in
the subject.

 

It is noted that recent information furnished to the
Department concerning the subject indicates that he is identified
as head of the International Anticommunist Brigade and was present
with several of his men at a gathering of some 75 Cubans at Davie
Airport, Davies, Florida, on July 2, 1961, at which occasion,
Gerald Patriciyfieming, head. of. “the, Intercontinental Penetration.

 

Forces, and séveral individuals made parachute ju jumps. The "Miami ig

Herald" on July 3, 1961, reportedly contained an article indi- ome fesse
cating that approximately 70 men of Sturgis' organization were
scheduled to make parachute jumps but only two parachutes were
available. In this article Sturgis (Fiorini) claimed his
organization has 5,000 men of which 700 are in training and that
his organization includes paratroop groups, underwater demolition
teams, and others in educational activities. ~ 5

In light of the above described activities on the part of
Sturgis, as well as his past history of extensive revolutionary
activity, it is the opinion of this Division that there is
sufficient indication of possible violations of Title 18, United
States Code, Section 960 to warrant investigation. : y
