Another who knows, or has know, Aline Mosby is forrer Agency employes
George ‘Winters, 55769. Winters stated during an interview in November
December 1960, vhen discussing Americano in Moscow who lived beyond their
meons, that newspeperman Harry Schapiro*“was « very heavy loser at poker =
to the extent that "one got the impression he was on the Soviet vudget."
Schnopiro, he said, had a Russian wife who was more eggrecsive than he.
Winters added thet newopsperwoman Aline Mosby was in Schapiro'’s office;
and commented that she "stuck mostly to the Foreign cireuit rather than
the Eubassy circuit." He said that she bed been in the hoapitel on severol
ocassions during the previous year, so that “one didn't see too mich of her"!
and added that according to gossip one hospitalization was ocassioned by an
abortion.

Another newspaperwoman in Moscow, whom Winters mentioned, was Priseilic
Jonson, #73589-DL. She has been mentioned in newspaper articles as one who
recolied having come in contact with Lee Harvey Oswald in Moscow, where she
interviewed (or talked) with him. Her name, like Mosby's,was listed in his”
efdress book under her lest nome only.

from the University of Montana in 1943. She was employed by United Press
in Seattle, Washington, from 1943 to 1945, and was Hollywood Correspondent
for UP from 1945 to 1957. According to the UP Burenu Managcr at Los Angoles,
she resigned voluntarily in 1957 and her employment was satisfactory. Ace
cording to Confidential informant R-1, during an Agency investigation in the
fall of 1958, she was dropped by UP when she was subpoeaned in connection
with legal suits against Confidential Magazine, for which she had done re-
write work without the knowledge of UP. She went to the Brussels World Fair
os a stringer for the North American Newspaper Allience. She was considered
loyal by her associates during the above period; but was described as "the
co-existence type who associates with Russians" ("pleys footsie with the
Russiens"). No informant questioned her loyalty.

In Jenuary 1960, Mosby reportedly was introduced on the Dave Garroway
Show, "Today", os NBC News' Correspondent; but in a State Department dis-
patch of 12 December 1950, which listed "Yestern Correspondents in Moscow",
she was named ap representing UPI.

According to HCUA records, Mosby did a motion picture critic type
article for the Daily Worker in 1947; wrote an article for the Daily Worker
st Laguna Beach, California, in 1949; and contributed a column to the Daily
Worker on 23 November 1956. According to records of the Civil Service Com-
mission, the Daily Worker of 26 July 1957 and 29 August 1057 carried infor-
mation regarding her.
