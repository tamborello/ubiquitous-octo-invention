for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Ewbassies.

 

With this forewarning, LIFEAT as disconnected. However,

as I recall, connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, end 1 Yugoslav line. The basehouse listening post had a live

 

 

 

 

monitor who made short sumeries of interesting conversations for a daily
resume which was received each day around 6 a.m. (passed by Flick to Goodsasture
to get to Scott before 9 a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)
full transcripts were typed and passed to the stetion in the seme way, however,
there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which hdd
Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening
post the day after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel)was

typed. These reels were taken to another location where they were translated
and typed. In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ren
about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of
_.Russian conversations among the embers of the Soviet Exbassy. During this
period (fa11 of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station
and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

 

 

it to to take to Boris.

 

 

 

 

 

 

handled all of the processi:.g of Soviet transcripts. My job involved screening
the photographs as soon as we leerned thet the man calling himself Oswald was
probably an Anericen. However, here again there was a backlag because the
photos were picked up three times a week but the ones picked up were usually
for dates a few days prefiously because the doctor processed the film on a
night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

Dene
operetors’ cleared the camera each day whether there was anyothimxexmm a full

roll of film exposed. Instructions were to cover office hours, photograph each
 

 

_g_ (SECT

new Soviet and family, all foreigners and foreign lieense plates, Euman
error did occur but generally the agents were conscientious, The Cuban

embassy coverage had more sophisticated equipment (a pulse camera) but it

 

 

 

frequently developed mechanical difficulties, Bob Zambarnardi and

 

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorna MacKay screened
the film inside the station.

I am certain thet the Oswald call came to our attention from the
Soviet line. It was picked u: end taken to Boris for a translation because
the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to
compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of
transcrists everf made in languages other than Spanish or English because Win
Scott could read only those two languages end he sersonally screened the

trenseripts for operational leads he wanted pursued.

Source: Notes made by A. Goodpasture
for John Leader, IG Steff
Subject: Background on Mexico Station Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. Unilateral coverage, From ithe time the Mexico Station was opened in

April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Seott as COS in 1958, Charles

 

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to
exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy. This umbrella type vroject (LIFEAT)
consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation,

 

 

 

a. Phone taps were placed by an

 

LE OY
who was handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines
tapped was inited’by availability of a listening post nearby
(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/
Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Ozech, etc) transcribers. Generally
these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

(which the station at that time felt was good security in that

if they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b, Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help
of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD
people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment
devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,
and LICALLA), LIMITED was e fixed site bang opposite across
the street from the front gate of the Soviet Embassy which had
both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

Northvest corner of their compound end LIMITED was diagonally

that block. LIMITED was the first base ard it operated s

+

trictly on an
exverimental basis in the early stages. JI think the Mexi Station bought

one storey
this property (a/Spanish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSINE (check to
be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when
the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the
public by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were moved to another apt
nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE
for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built
on this site). LILYRIC was planned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED.
It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sare side of the street
as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slantéd view of
the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy. The agents in LIMITED end LILYRIC (both
Mexican families) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.
LILYRIG was a rented apartment, LICALLA, the third photo site, was located
in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Embassy compound
which the Mexico Station purchased in about 1958 (check date), also using
LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of
the Soviet Embassy compound. The ourpose of this opsretion was to get good
identification photographs of the Soviet versonnel (who et that time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records), The three photo sites were handled by

 

 

(Mexican citizen of U.S. mother who taught elementary level at

‘fas run out of another ohe of these houses (erypt for the four houses vas

LIMUST/1, ete). This was handled by Glen WIDDEN (outside TSD officer) and

Mahoney using HQ TDY teams for monitoring. This operation was also separate

from LICALLA, The two houses in between were rented to unsuspecting tenants.

ce. Mobile surveillance was developed by Anderson and leter placed
under Mahoney and Joseph Sancho, ‘This team consisted of a half
dozen or so agents who used three to four late model cars and a
panel truck (which could be used on stake outs for photo covera:e).
The plan was to activate this group by radio (from LIMITED BASE)
Soviet
when someone of interest left the/Embassy sate and stay with them
until they made their meetings, These agents knew about the LIMITED
BASE be€ause they had LIMITED photos for identification purposes.
This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (cheek date)
when one of the surveillance agents got too close to his target and
was arrested by the Mexican transit police and turned over to the

Mexican Secret Service. By the time the Station could arrange through

 

a cleared attorney to bail him out

 

 

 

 

 

the agent had identified Sancho (who was

 

evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside --
