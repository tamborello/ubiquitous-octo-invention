i "Fidel Castro toppled Batista the last night of

! 1988. From thut time I was devoting most of my time to the

: Agency. I ran, from my office, a country-wide press service.

} I handled several agents. In the summer of 1959 I was

instructed by the Station to attend a meeting with a group

: of Cubans plotting against Fidel Castro. . {See Memorandum

for the Record of 6 August 1959.) The last sentence of my

report on this neeting read: ‘With the new death penaity

\ in Cuba for anti-revolution activity, it is not hard to

: imagine that at least one member of this group might inform

: to the government.’ That was prophetic. The Cubans in the

meeting, with two exceptions, went to jail where several of

; them remain to this day. There was some indication that

i the meeting might have been bugged. [f was advised of this
while in the U. S. (still working on tho tolevision project)

and the Station suggested there might be danger in my

returning to Havana. If elected to return.

“By this time (late summer of 1959) Pidel Castro
‘had eliminated "public relations'. I had no clients, and no
prospect of obtaining them, Despite this I stayed in Havana
- until March of 1960 doing nothing but Agency work. When I :
' did return it was acknowledged that I would be coming back
to staff status (my contract was amended again while I was
\ ’  gtill in Havana to pay for shipment of furniture). Immediately
on arriving in the Washington area I began to work as a staffer
on the Bay of Pigs operation.

"In summary: Despite intent on my part to have a
private business, I besan working for the Agency when I arrived,
in Havana, often in TDY status which was full-time Agency work.

I never obtained a major client for mv public relations firm.

I was always on call and working on instructions from the

Station until recalled for the Headquarters assignment. There
was some risk in much of what I was tasked to do by the Station.”

' “During this period I recall a number of activities
undertaken For the Station, an! I travelled to New York for
clandestine training. The file indicates ‘He was originally
approved operationally to handle the complex Soviet espionage
caso Of CRULSITNATER- 2. His conduct of this case was considered

excellent&." Also, "It will be recalled that Headquarters

was very pleased with the printing job...which he had done.*
The latter was indicative of a number of such chores, when [f
stayed behind in my plant after the, enployees had left for
the night, printing leaflets, booklets, etc. I also handlod
agents and did a number of spotting and assessing jobs for

the Station.

“Y signed a new contract on 25 January 1952 for
$500.00 per month which ran until the termination date of
31 August 1953. (Actually this was in the form of a loan
which was paid off at the rato of $500.00.. The advance was
used to purchase printing equipment which allowed me to do
certain work foyshe Station, but which I retained.)

MAE rmination of the contract on 31 August I
remained in until 4 March 1954. During this period I
recruited af€PJagent who still works for the Station--and
was a cabline ember under On 3 February 1954

Headquarters asked that I be made available for another
assignment. The Station pointed out that I was working on

the recruitment, and thet I and my family were planning on

a Furopean vacation. Headquarters again requested my assign-
ment. Thus I departed for the Guatemala project in early
March, abandoning my free family trip to Eurepe (tickets

paid for by advertising in my paper) and leaving my fanily
behind to pack up. I accepted this assignment without knowing
where it was, or for how long it would last. Indeed I did

not even have a contract. 6-23
