Dear Nina;

This is a response to your letters of 30 September and 27 October
1993 and 31 January and 25 February 1994, enclosing material for CIA
review under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992. This collection comprises seven documents (plus four duplicates),
with a total of 40 pages. In all but two of the documents, CIA is
‘asking for postponements of some passages under the terms of §§ (1) (A),
(1) (B), (1) (C), and (4) of Section 6 of the Act. These passages are
maxked in yellow highlighting. For those passages marked off by red or
black ink brackets, but without yellow highlighting, CIA has determined
that said passages may be released under the terms of the Act.

I apologize personally for the inordinate delay in getting these
documents back to you.

Sincerely,

hCG

Dear Ms Filjegovic:

We are returning herewith the documents from the Bureau of
Diplomatic Security of the Department which we were asked to review for
coordination last year. Mr. Henry Cohen, DS/POC/FOIA, hand-carried this
package to us; I understand Mr. Cohen has since retired from the

Department .

We count 90 documents (252 pages) in this package. The Historical
Review Group of CIA has determined that 47 of these documents may be
released in full, as far as CIA equities are concerned. We are asking
for postponements of some passages in the remaining 43 documents under
the terms of §§ (1) (A), (1) (B), (1) (C), and (3) of Section 6 of the JFK
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. These passages are marked
in yellow highlighting..

We apologize for the delay.
Sincerely, .

Dear Nina:

I am returning to you herewith the documents from the
Department of State collection of President. John F. Kennedy
assassination records which I had begun to review in your
office on 27 September. Of the 77 documents in your two
accompanying lists, we have released in full--~or indicated.
no objection to release in full-~-49.5, and we have indicated
deletions of still sensitive CIA information (really _
minimal) in 25.5. This leaves two in your list (both on
page three) which are technically missing from the package,
but I am sure these are just different readings of message
numbers or dates. You will see right away where they fit.

Thank you for the opportunity to review this. material
for CIA interests. If we can be of any further assistance,
please let us know.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT: Referrals Under the JFK Assassinations Records
Collection Act of 1992

Dear John, ,

As I mentioned over the telephone, we have uncovered one
more document requiring CIA review which I am enclosing.
Hopefully this will be the last one.

I am also returning to you CIA's referral under the Act to
HDR of August 23, which John Glennon has reviewed. As you can
see by his note, he completed it several days ago, and I forgot
to pass it on to you when you were over the other day. John
Glennon has indicated one document for postponement. Although
I am returning it to you with the rest at this point, I have
passed a copy of it on to the reviewers in Diplomatic Security,
who are coordinating a response with CA. I will call you when
I get an answer from them. If they decide to release it, we
would then have to obtain a concurrence from FBI.

‘Thank you again for your prompt action in reviewing our
request. I will be getting back to you on the DS answer after
I return on October 7.

Sincerely,

a a

Dear John,

I have found one more document that requires CIA review,
the attached memorandum from the Deputy Director for Plans to
the Director of INR, September 2, 1966 (State ID No. 17-228).
The document was reviewed by the Department's Mandatory Review

6 of the JFK Act. Mandatory review also indicated that the
document should be reviewed by CIA.

Please let me know CIA's. decision on the status of this
document. If there has been prior release or if CIA now has no

objection to its release, I will convey this information to our
Mandatory Review staff.

Sincerely,
