AIRTEL TO SACs, NY, WFO
RE: . STUART S, OGILVIE, ET AL.
2935376

 

If the bank examining agency has no record of

irregularity, WFO terminate its inquiry and incorporate results
of all inquiry, including that conducted by New York, into a
LHM suitable for dissemination and. furnish to Bureau with
information copy designated for New York. In preparing this LEM
insure the contents are paraphrased sufficiently te conceal
identity of the source and omit any mention of Rockhill Lodge

“ and Resort Corporation, inasmuch as to do so would compromise

. ' the source.

New York insure results of its inquiry in this matter
ave immediately furnished to WFO so that LHM, if required, will
be all-inclusive.

This matter is to be afforded preferred attention and
the Bureau is to be kept currently advised of all significant
developiients. a

NOTE: Ny 3936-C has furnished information to the effect that John
Gleason, son of Teddy Gleason, President, international Longshoremen's
Agsogiation (ILA) controls a large percentage of ILA welfare fund premiums
through GBM Brokerage Corporation, New York City, and that substantial
amounts of these premiums are deposited in First NationalBank of
Washington, D, C. Source alleges that Stuart Ogilvie, Senior Vice=
President, First Natépma] Bank, is a contact of John Gleason and by having
these ILA welfare fund premiums on deposit Gleason obtained loans from
First National Bank through Ogilvie and Ogilvie allegedly received a
commission on each loan. he approved, Source cited as an example a $500,000
loan allegedly obtained by Rockhill Lodge and. Resort Corporation through
Ogilvie and alleged that Ogilvie received a fee fur this loan, It was
source's understanding that bank examiners recently reviewed loans of First
National Bank and found that loans issued by Ogilvie were not in accordance
with good practice and as a result of this examination the officials of
Rockhill were pressed for payment of this loan. Source is not involved -

in the payoff by Rockhill to Ogilvie, but learned of the Rockhill loan
when he was asked to assist in obtaining money from another source to

repay the loan at First National Bank. It is believed that contact can

be made with appropriate bank examining agency covering First National

Bank to determine if recent bank examination disclosed irregularities at
this bank and, if so, open investigation can proceed without compromising
the source, :
