who was in the midst of this rebellion, had told us that he would endeavor to assist
us but indicated at the same time that a possible contractual agreement existed with
King. Culligan had been previously discreetly briefed concerning King's domination
by communist influences and of his shameful immoral character. Culligan has
advised that a contract did exist with King for the ''Post" article and that the
recalcitrant group within Curtis had insisted that publication of it be carried through
because of King’s recent Nobel Peace Prize. Although he was completely sympathetic
with our aims and regretted his inability to be of service in this specific instance,

he pointed out that we should feel free to call upon him in the future if there is any
way in which he can be of help to the Bureau. Culligan advised that the King article
was scheduled for early publication sometime after election.

 

In connection with this 'Post't article by King, our sources have
indicated that since he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize he has attempted through
some of his associates to change the "Post" article in an effort to soften criticism
made by him against other civil rights groups and leaders. King feared that such
criticism would cause difficulties in the civil rights movement. The "Post" however,
has resisted King's efforts to make these changes.

CO CURTIS. PUBLISHING. COMPANY we. Tobi

Mr. Trotter

As you know, there has been a bloody power struggle Tele. Room

within the Curtis organization aimed at deposing our good friend, Joe Miss Holmes
Culligan, Chairman of the Board, and, until about a week or so ago, Miss Gandy
(¥ President. Bitter charges of mismanagement werg-lturled at Culligan by

 

 

 

 

Saturday Evening Post" and all Curtis magazihes, ‘and Marvin DacKeontot, $80, 000
“a year Senior Vice President in charge of the magazine divisién. Ina nutshell,

Blair and Kantor_have been fired; NormareRftter, Assistant Managing Editor, and
Thomas R.-Marvel, Chief of Editorial Production, have been suspended. Culligan,
who has Been ; actively looking for a top executive to assist him in running the affairs
of Curtis for sometime, resigned as President while retaining his job as Chairman
of the Board. It is expected that a new President will be named soon.

? ty . sat
= “2 This top management revolt, which has been brewing for some months,
erupted openly during the early part of October when the press reported that fifteen
top officials in a letter to the Board of Directors accused Culligan of mismanagement.
At the present time, it appears that Culligan has retained the confidence of the Board
of Directors, has seized the initiative, and is making a thorough house cleaning.
oe -
‘% Culligan has been a good friend of the Director and the Bureau for
a number of.years. He has demonstrated his support and admiration on numerous
occasions and has been most cooperative with us. It was he who offered to feature
a lead article in a May issue of the "Post" concerning the Director's 40th Anniversary,
with a photograph of Mr. Hoover on the cover. Harlier, through Culligan, we
squelched the unfavorable article against the Bureau being written by free-lance
writer, Dan J. Marlowe, submitted to the "Post" concerning our investigation of 4
Nussbaum and Wilcoxson. More recently, through Culligan, we postponed publication
in the 'Post'' of an article based upon the assault of our Agent Foley in New York by,
the Lombardozzi family. Early in 1964, we received word of an article being “ NG
published in the ''Post" by Martin Luther King. Through Culligan, we forestalled .
publication of this article. More recently, with the Director's approval, I
contacted Culligan on September 22, 1964, concerning another article our sources
‘told us that Martin Luther King was preparing for the "Post" At that me, Culligan,

Miss Wells advised that she was one of the 18 wormen reporters
who were in on the Byerview with Mr. Hoover, She stated that she understands
that Martin Luther King now wants to come in and talk to the Director. She
wamted to Know if she could cover this interview and in the event she could not

| cover the interview itself, she wanted to know if she could talk to both the
Director and King immediately after the meeting if there was one.

Hanning advised Miss Wells that the Director's schedule was
very full and that Mr. Hoover was leaving the city on official business in the
\ near future and he was unaware of any such appointment and could not be of
assistance to her. Miss Wells was very insistent and stated she would probably
