Title: PROCUREMENT OF ASSASSINATION RECORD REVIEW
AND CLASSIFICATION CONSULTATION SERVICES

Synopsis: It is requested that the services of Margaret Ann Cook

be extended through Fiscal Year 1998. °
&

Details: The Historical and Executive Review Unit (HERU) is

responsible for transferring FBI records covered by the

“President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act

of 1992" (the Act) to the National Archives and Records

Administation (NARA). To date over 666,000 pages have been
transferred to NARA and at least 180,000 pages remain to be
transferred.

The Act provides that certain information in records
sent to NARA can be postponed (withheld). One basis for
postponement is the demonstrated need to continue to classify
specific information. However, the Task Force is attempting to
minimize the amount of postponed information in part by
declassifying information whenever it is possible to do so. FBI
JFK records contain a great deal of classified information,
relating chiefly to Russian, Cuban and Communist Party USA
(CPUSA) matters. Much declassification has been accomplished by
Document Classification Unit (DCU) personnel assigned to the Task
Force and additional declassification has been achieved through a
review conducted by personnel from the National Security Division

(NSD) . . ERA HP-1PEIZIS - Bb by

* Mrs. Cook was the Supervisor of the DCU analysts
assigned to the Task Force from November 1993 until her
retirement in March 1995 and has served as a classification
consultant to the JFK Task Force since that time. Her experience
and vast knowledge the JFK Act and how it applies to FBI records
cannot be duplicated. .

Re: 62A-HQ-1029205, 09/18/1997

The JFK Records Collection Act not only calls the
release of all records relating to the Assassination of President
Kennedy and the various “conspiracy” theories; it also
established an independent Presidential Review Board to oversee
the identification and release of those records. The
Assassination Records Review Board (the Board) was appointed by
President Clinton, confirmed by the United States Senate and was
sworn in on April 11, 1994. The Board reviews federal agencies'
documents for release and had until October 1, 1997 to fulfill
its obligation. Recently President Clinton signed a law
authorizing a one-year extension for the Board. The Board has
until October 1, 1998 to complete the review of all records
relating to the JFK Assassination and will not be given another
extension.

Due to the time constraints placed on the JFK Task
Force and Mrs. Cook's unequivicable institutional knowledge, it
is imperative that Mrs. Cook's contract be extended one
additional year. It is requested that Mrs. Cook's consultation
services be contracted for one additional year (10/1/97-9/30/98)
at a cost not to exceed $35,000 for the fiscal year.
