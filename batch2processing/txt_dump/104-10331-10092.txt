1. At its monthly meeting on 30 January the Assassination
Records Review Board (ARRB) will address the issue of employee
names contained within the JFK collection. The names of
employees who retired under cover must continue to be protected.
Because we could not determine the cover status of several
retirees named in the JFK collection, their names also must
continue to be protected on the basis that they might have
retired under cover.

2. The attachment lists those whom we have identified as
having retired in overt or covert status.
