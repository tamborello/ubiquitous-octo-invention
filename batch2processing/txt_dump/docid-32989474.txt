No specific leads are set out concerning known
individuals with whom NEEDLEMAN had been in contact. When-
ever these persons appear to be engaged in activities that
seem to be consistent with activities’ peculiar to a Communist
apparatus, they are made the subjects’ of separate investiga-
tions. The results of these investigations are analyzed to
determine whether these individuals are engaged in any
clandestine activity in the intelligence or political fields.
In this manner, the NEEDLEMAN file operates as a control

On December 23, 1963, an anonymous source of the
NYO advised that, NEEDLEMAN was the recipiént of an unsigned
letter from JACKQROVINSKY, dated December 11, 1963 (at
Peking, China). VENSKY enclosed a summary of an article
which had appeared in the Chinese monthly literary journal
"Wen Yi Pao.” This article criticized modern revisionist
art and particularly the Soviet film director G. CHUKHRAI
in connection with some of his statements and some of the
films directed by nim. &X)

In this letter ROVINSKY stated that he still

On Januery 17, 1964, an anonymous source of the
NYO reported that JACK ROVINSKY wrote NEEDLEMAN an unsigned
letter dated January 5, 1964 (at Peking, China) acknowledging
1363 (0) ( a communication from NEEDLEMAN dated December 18,

1983 (U)

ROVINSKY indicated that he ( and his family)
expected to leave China by the end of July or sometime in
August, 1964, although he had a two year leave of absence
(from Cuba}, which under certain circumstances could be
extended to three years. He stated that he had signed a
one year contract (with the Chinese) and that he pretty
much expected not to renew it. Since he had leave of
absence, he thought he would like to have the experience
of working in another socialist country. ROVINSKY toid
NEEDLEMAN that there was a fundamental difference between
those who are "invited" to work in a given country, and
those that are not "invited" but come on their ow. He
stated that this difference applied to the level of the
work, classification, and nay, and was not necessarily
predicated on individuel capabilities. For this reason,
ROVINSKY said he would prefer to go to another country on
the basis of an "invitation." uw)

L ROVINSKY suggested that working in the Soviet.

Union would probably provide the sharpest contrast, but

work in some other country might prove equally interesting.

He indicatec that his wife had been teaching English on a
university level, and that he had been working as an "expert" |
in the English larguage and also doing some translation work
from Spanish into English. (A()(y)

 

ROVINSKY ended by saying that he wovld welcome
any ideas or suggestions NEEDLEMAN might nave CX )(U)

On January 23, 1964, the same source reported
that JACK ROVINSKY wrote NEEDLEMAN an undatee and unsigned

‘JACOB CHILDS visited NEED 's office that day and

; mentioned that JACK COWAN, who was denied admittance to

would be willing to put up $5,000.00, which NEEDLEMAN could
_have, if NEEDLEMAN could get him into the United States in
such a way that he would not have to come as 4 witness, or
‘sign any affidavits. COWAN, according to CHILDS, wanted y uw)
