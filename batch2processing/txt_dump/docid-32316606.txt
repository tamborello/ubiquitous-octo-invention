BRAUER @s contained in the aforementioned Tampa report of
SA JOHN H,. MILLER, May 22, 1964.

The LHM is classified Confidential because it
sets forth information received from TP 139-S, the dis-
closure of whose identity could be detrimental to the
national defense.

Local dissemination by the Miami Office of the
LHM is being made to INS; CIA; G-2, Ft. McPherson, Georgia;
Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, U. S. Department of State;
U. S. Coast Guard; U. S. Customs, Miami; U. S. Customs,
Region 2; U. S. Border Patrol; ONI; and, OSI.

In view of Bureau instructions that interview
of REYNOLDS A, MOODY was not desired, and in view of the
lack of any additional information that MOODY is engaged
in Cuban revolutionary affairs, this case is being placed
in a closed status.
