SUBJECT: Keenan v. U.S.DeJ & CIA
Barry,

. 1. Request that your office conduct a search to determine whether it has any records containing the name of Laurence P.
KEENAN {d.0.b. 23 Nov 1924; p.o.b. Dover, NH; : Sof marl Since this request is pursuant to a lawsuit under FOIA and the
Privacy Act, all that is required is a search reasonably calculated to-locate the responsive records. An index ssarchghould he sufficient;
no hand saarch is necessary. . ;

2. KEENAN was an FBI agent who claims to have been involved with investigating Lee Harvey OSWALD's purported contact
with Cuban and Soviet agents in Mexico City. The CIA's IP&CRD office responded to Keenan that no records indexed by his name were
located, but | am unsure whether your office was tasked with the initial request.

3. Please do not hesitate to contact me via Lotus Notes or on x76195 if | may be of further assistance. Thanks.

Michael
