 

Florida east coast to locate the "Las Villas" as. it
approaches the Florida coast. The plane! and speedboat
are scheduled. to coordinate their movements with ‘the
aid of walkie-talkie radios. After the "Las Villas"

is sighted, the plane is supposed to return to. the
Florida mainland in order to pick up a number of 25 lb.
napalm. bombs. at. a predesignated spot. Laredo Rodriguez,
treasurer of the MIRR, is in charge of st

napalm bombs and making them available foL | after
the "Las Villas"-is sighted.

 

The napalm is supposed to be dropped on the _ RSS
"Las Villas" immediately prior to the torpedo attack je
in order to divert attention from the Bertram speedboat. SP

MM T-1 said that Bosch is not personally
participating in either the air or sea attack, however, -
he plans to use this opération, if successful, as. a.means
of ‘raising further funds for additional attacks against
Castro. MM T-1 is of the opinion that Bosch is motivated
by personal reasons to obtain publicity, fame and money,
while:at the same time having a desire to do something
against the Castro regime. .

the following information. .

 

. Bosch has drawn up. plans for a joint sea and
air raid designed to sink théM"Las Villas", a 300 foot
Cuban freighter which is scheduled to have recently
departed Marséilles, France, for Havana, Cuba, with a load’
of heavy equipment aboard such as railroad stock or busés.
Bosch planned to have this attack take place off. the coast
of South Florida somewhere along the sea route normally
used by ships proceeding toward Havana from Europe.

| : MM T-l1 advised that there are two sea routes
normally used by vessels coming from Europe to Havana.
One of these routes approaches the coast of Florida at
a point directly north. of the Little Bahama Bank ‘in the
Bahama Islands. The other approach is through the
Northwest Providence Channel which is directly. south of
