In view of the cooperation of Mr.. MOORE and
due to the fact that MARCELLO never makes reservations
in advance, it is felt this misur can best be effected
through the use of mutt radio microphones and/or wasp.
plugs. Attached is a brochure of the Town House Motel
in Lafayette, Louisiana. ._ Mr. MOORE has advised that
MARCELLO always requests Unit 104 or some similar unit
when he is alone. If MARCELLO is accompanied by his
wife and daughter, he requests Units 120 and 121 or
Units 375 and 377. Mr. MOORE has advised that whenever :
he makes accommodations available to MARCELLO he will
either give us adjacent accommodations or accommodations |
near MARCELLO's accommodations.

 

In connection with this matter, the following
equipment is requested: |

1. Mutt radio microphones installed in the

lamps, which will be forwarded to the Laboratory under
separate cover. In the event the Laboratory is not in

a position to install Mutts in the lamp bases, sockets,

or elsewhere on the lamp, it is requested that the Laboratory
furnish this office with two Wasp plugs and installation
will be made by this office when needed. For the infor-
mation of the Laboratory, in the event the glass parts

of the Lamps are broken, replacements are available.
.It is pointed out that the purple lamp is utilized on

a table in the immediate vicinity of a’ couch and lounge
chair in the room at the motel and the grey lamp is utilized
on a table between two beds next to the telephone. It

is believed that in the event the adjacent room is not
available when it is needed, it is felt that equipment,

as: noted above, will provide coverage of the conversation

in the motel room.

2. <A Vega Receiver for use in monitoring the . i
above-mentioned equipment.

 

3. Two Termites.

4, .One Magnecord PT-6-BA2H Binaural Tape Recorder,
