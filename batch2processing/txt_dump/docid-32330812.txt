Informant advised RUSSO hangs out at the Golden
Slipper Tavern on St. Claude and is believed to live either
nearby or possibly in the French Quarter. RUSSO is living
with a New Orleans prostitute, name unknown, possibly JEAN,
white female, about 25, with black hair.

 

be Informant advised this woman contacted NOFIO

bo . PECORARO, Operator of the Tropical Court on Gentilly Highway,
New Orleans, and told PECORARO that RUSSO pulled this job, |
that he had the loot hidden and never carries over four or
five hundred dollars with him at a time. This woman is help-~
ing PECORARO try to steal the loot from RUSSO, and PECORARO
has hired ABE COCHRAN (PH), a New Orleans pimp and strong-
arm man, to try to find the loot and heist the loot from
RUSSO.

 

Informant advised he has learned from other
contacts in New Orleans that RUSSO pulled this job and
states ABE COCHRAN told him personally on the night of
9/4/63 that he had been unsuccessful in finding the loot
but is certain that RUSSO has it. Informant advised that
COCHRAN whom he believes to have a record with the NOPD,
will probably talk if put under pressure, but. requested
that COCHRAN not be interviewed until RUSSO is either inter-
viewed or picked up in order to avoid compromising informant.

whom NOFIO PECORARO hired to try and heist the loot from oF
RUSSO, that RUSSO and his girl friend had a fight recently
due to the fact that she was trying to elicit from RUSSO the
whereabouts of the loot. According to COCHRAN, the girl,
whose name informant still knows only as JEAN, apparently
obtained about $1,400 of the loot from RUSSO, which she turned
over to COCHRAN.
