this place are those who are actively engaged in illegal activities
of La Cosa Nostra group, such as gambling, loan sharking, etc.

 

11. Possibilities of obtaining desired information by other means oT
(Explain in detail): Considering that ANGELO BRUNO has in=
structed informant to obtain legitimate employment, thereby
necessitating the informant be away from his criminal associates
during the day hours, there is no other means of obtaining this
information in as complete detail as would be available by ©
technical coverage. It will be a check on the informant,
realizing he will not know that installation is going to be
made. His membership in La Cosa Nostra will be a drawing card
to other members of La Cosa Nostra to frequent this location.
He has indicated that among the members they frequéntly discuss
previous illegal activities, including murders they have committed.

.

 

12. Risks of detection involved: It is contemplated that coverage
of 900 S. 8th St., Phila., will be a ZAM unit which affords more
security than any other type installation-available. This unit
is not even recognized by trained telephone personnel.

 

13. Probable length of technical surveillance: 90 day trial period.

this communique was informant's efforts to open luncheonette

| request for lump sum payment of $300. 00 to assist informant
i in this regard.

 

Bureau by letter 5/27/64 entitled "PH 672-C=TE,
Top Echelon Criminal Informant Program," authorized payment
of $300.00 as requested, plus authority to continue payments
to informant on C.0.D. basis up to $325.00 per month.

On 5/27/64 informant advised he had made initial
payment of rent in the amount of $65.00 and thereby secured
control of the first floor of the vacant property at 900

_S.-8th -, Phila. He will obtain equipment for operation
of this luncheonette from his brother. He and his brother,
SAM-SCAFIDI, member of La Cosa Nostra, formerly operated
-a luncheonette near this address.

The $300. 00 payment to the informant will give him

j to make installation at both_900 and 902 S. 8th Street for i
| reasons ingluded therein. \PRila. can undertake this endeavor
| during the week of June 1, as informant was successful in
renting the address at 900 S. 8th St. :

It is proposed that 902 S. 8th St. be covered by
use of a mite or similar unit used for penetrating a wall.
There will be no trespass of 902 S, 8th St.; however, during
the crucial period of time when wall will be drilled, Phila.
Agents can be in MAIORIELLO's barber shop to g¢urnish direction
‘to sound personnel who would be actually performing the task.

.

 

 

Informant has been told that two individuals,
identities unknown to the informant, will help him paint he
~ and make necessary preparation for opening the luncheonette, Pee
The informant will tell his associates these men are indi- \
viduals he met when living in the Willow Grove, Pa. area.
The two individuals will, of course, be sound trained Agents.

; Phila. is at a disadvantage in that two of the sound
trained Agents are known by sight in the vicinity of 8th and
Christian Sts. It is, therefore, requested that the Bureau
authorize a sound trained Agent from a nearby office to assist
SA JAMES FINLEY in this regard. SA FINLEY is a resident agent
at Doylestown and could answer any questions asked of him by
any associates of informant.

It is proposed that the coverage of 900 S. 8th St.
will be undertaken with the use of a "ZAM" unft“or with a
"mate" unit being placed in the actual telephone network.
| These two types of coverage can furnish the best security
' available, :

 

It is believed that sound Agents will not be
jeopardized in any way. Phila. Agent personnel can be in
the area without compromising the sound Agents' position.
it is believed that under these conditions complete security
can be afforded. The actual installation would be over a
two or three day period while painting and other chores are
being performed. These Agents will be alone in the store,
which is at present vacant.

The potential of these sources, if authorized and
successfully installed, cannot-be over-emphasized.
