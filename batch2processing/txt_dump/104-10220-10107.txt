hinte to the effect that he hue ODEARL backing. Express the view
that, without being privy to ODEARL views, it would be sure
prising indeed were PRIO considered by anyone in leading ODYOKE
position anything but a painful reminder that abuvea of public trust
had something to do with the success of Castro's revolution,

1, AMBIDDY-1 was debriefed on his relations with PRIO, As soon
as our notes have bean processed, tho text of his re on the subject will ©
be forwarded. Suffice it to say that A-1 has no understanding with and no
respect for PRIO. He would, however, accept pt PRIO!s money, with no strings
attached, on the theory that it Js Cuban property returned to its rightful

custodian, i.@., AMBIDDY-1.

2. Av HOS sees it, PRIO's main role is one of creating a nuisance
and of rendering A-I'e political problema in Nicaragua slightly more com-
plicated, if WAVE can see a sacure means of putting a spoke in PRIO's
wheel, ils efforts along those Mnes would bo appreciated, It would potbably
auffice to drop some hints to the effect that responsible and competent
observers viow PRIO as a hau-been and refuse to take hia leadership b=

aspirations seriously. 2

    
   
   
     
 

   
     

 

3. For Mexico Station; May we request that you air the above
thame ina widely read column, making the following points:

      
     

a, Allude to reports that PRIO and BRACERB-I and °
ERACORN-] have reached an undorstanding whereby PRICG will
be socognived au leader of the resistance against Cuba.

   
    

      

hb. Pay BRACERB-I and ERACORN-1 the left-handed
compliment that they are uniikely to hitch thelr wagon to the
vanishing star of PiuO,

   
   
    
     

sc. Guggest that PRLO could render one vital contribution,
vig. cough up aame of the millions he stole from the Cuban people
while prasident, As for tho rest, ne should lapse ints silence
and ist respectable peaple do the job.
