COUNTRY HAS MANY PROBLEYS WHICH DEFY SOLUTION , BUT WHAT WORRIES
PIDEL CASTRO THE MOST IS THAT HE IS UNABLE TO SEE ANY SOLUTION TO
THE CRISIS. ALL ECONOMIC PLANS END IN FAILURE, CASTRO BLAMES THE
PERSONALITIES INVOLVED AND PUBLICLY CASTIGATES THEM, BUT HE REFUSES
TO BELIEVE THE SYSTEM IS WRONG. AS A RESULT, CASTRO ASSUMES PER. ~

2. CUBA REALIZES THAT THE USSR CANNOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ALL OP CUBA'S ECONOMIC NEEDS UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS, THERE-
FORE, CUBA HAS CHANGED HER FOREIGN COMMERCIAL POLICY AND IS NOW
PLACING INCREASED EMPHASIS ON TRADE WITH NON-BLOC COUNTRIES,
INITIALLY, WHEN CUBA HAD AMPLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE, THE POLICY OF IN-
CREASING TRADE WITH NON-BLOC COUNTRIFS SHOWED SOME PROMISE, BUT

WITH INADEQUATE EXCHANGE FACILITIES, AS AT PRESENT, CUBA IS UNABLE “ee

TO MEET TERMS oF EXISTING COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS AND IS FINDING IT
DIFFICULT TO NEGOTIATE NEW AGREEMENTS, THE FEW AGREEMENTS WHICH
HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED CONTAIN TERMS UNFAVORABLE TO CUBA,

3, CUBA'S ECONCMIC-COMMERCIAL DILEMMA IS THE PRIMARY REASON
WHY CUBAN AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE ANTONIO CARRILLO CARRERAS RETURNED
TO HAVANA ON 1 DECEMBER, (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: SEE TDCS-314/06460-
64.) PIERRE NIETO, FRENCH BUSINESSMAN WHO IS-IN HAVANA, IS PROPOS-
ING A SIXTY-MILLION-DOLLAR TRADE PACKAGE FOR WHICH NIETO CLAIMS HE
CAN ARRANGE FRENCH FINANCING, THIS IS ONE OF THE SPECIFICS WHICH
CARRILLO, WHO DISLIKES NIETO, IS DISCUSSING WITH FIDEL CASTRO AND
ERNESTO "CEE" GUEVARA, (FIELD COMMENT: SOURCE, WHO LEFT HAVANA’ IN
EARLY NOVEMBER 1964, NOTED THAT A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE
TERRE WAS A DISTINCT CHANGE IN THE ATTITUDE OF HIGH CUBAN OFFICIALS
WITH RESPECT TO THS UNITZD STATES, ON THE BASIS OF CONVERSATIONS
WITH OFFICIALS CLOSE TO FIDEL CASTRO, WHOM SOURCE DID NOT IDENTIFY,
SOURCE BECAME CONVINCED THAT CASTRO IS WILLING TO ENTER INTO COM-
7 MERCIAL DIALOGUE WITH TEE UNITED STATES AND IS SEARCHING FOR

i “OPENINGS TO DO SO.)

4. BECAUSE CASTRO IS ASSUYING PERSONAL 8 RESPONSIBILITY FOR
MANY OF CUBA'S ECOXGAIC PROGRAYS AND IS ALSO FAILING, MORE PEOPLE
ARE BEGINNING TO CRITICIZE HIM, ALTHOUGH NOT 10 THE EXTENT OF DIS-
CUSSING TEE POSSIBILITY OF REMOTING HIM FROM POWER, (SOURCE COMMENT:
CASTRO REMAINS THE SOLE KEY TO THE CUBAN PROBLEM AND WHILE RE IS IN
PLACE NO ONE DARES ATTEMPT TO CRGANIZE A COUP AGAINS ST HIS REGIE.)
(HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: RUMORS ABOUT THE EVENTS WHICH LED TO THE™
DISMISSAL ON 19 NOVEMBER OF JOAQUIN ORDCQUY MESA SUCGEST THAT
SOURCE'S THESIS MAY NOT BZ COMPLETELY VALID; CSDB-312/01269-64 IS
‘ AMONG REPORTS WHICH INDICATE THAT ORDOQUI HAD BEEN PLANNING A COUP,)
5. ALTHCUGH THEY ARS GPPOSED TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CUBA, IN-
DIVIDUALS LIKE EFIGENIO AMRIJNIRA3S DELGADO, YiCE-MINISTER OF SPECIAL
! AFFAIRS OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND JOSE A, NARANJO, PRESIDENT OF THE
COMMITTEE OF COORDINATION, EXECUTION AND <¥SPSCTION (JUCEI) IN
HAVANA, ARE AFRAID TO PARTICIPATE I¥ OR EVEN PLAN A MOVE AGAINST
: CASTPO, OTHER PERSONS WHO REACH A POINT CF TOTAL FRUSTRATION EITHER
| LEAVE CUBA IF THEY CAN, OR RESIGN THELR POSITIONS AS DID JCS ASSEF ..
{ YARA, ASSEF HAD BELN OFFERED THS JOB AS JUCEI CHIEF IN MARIANAO
BUT HE WAS CONVINCED OP THE NEED TO REFLACE EVERY HICH OFFICIAL IN
TEE MONICIPALITY, AW HE BELIEVED BE WOULD NcT RECEIVE THE BACKING
OF TFE REGIME IF HE DID SO. ASSEF NOW ATTENDS CLASSES AT HAVANA
