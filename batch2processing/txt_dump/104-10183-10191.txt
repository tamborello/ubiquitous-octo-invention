MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Invitation to AMLASH/1 via Manuel RODRIGUEZ

REFERENCE: AMWHIP/1 Memo, dated 31 August 1964

i, At 1130 hours on 4 September 1964, AMWHIP/1 tele-
phoned the undersigned from New York to say that he had just
talked with RODRIGUEZ in Mexico. RODRIGUEZ had stated that
he, as a private citizen and doctor, was unable to arrange
an invitation for AMLASH/1 to the 16th National Assembly of
Surgeons to be held in Mexico City, in November 1964, He
had, however, been able to arrange to have AMLASH/1 invited
by the Mexican Govt, through the help of a Mexican official
whose name ASN#HIP/1 had forgotten (but deliveved that it .
was Canizares, or something similar). If there are no hitches,
then, AMLASH71 should be able to come to Mexico this November,

2. €auardo PERNAS|: AMWHIP/1 said that he had made_a ob
mistake regarding the name of the long~time mistress of (erxas;

that her nickname was “Nica" (Dr. Antonio YANEZ), rather than
"TINA" (Vincentina ANTUNA) as he had previously thought. (This
coaforms to information provided by a WAVE report).

3, AMWHIP/1's Mexican Visa: AMWHIP/1 stated that he had
had trouble the Tast time he applied for a Mexican visa (some
six months age), and asked if we could help him in this matter,
He was told that this would be too obvious to too many people,
and that it was best if he try again himself, giving either
business or pleasure as the reason for wishing to travel to
Mexico, He said that he would try again himself today (the

fourth).

: 4, A\WHIP/1L pians to leave tonight or tomorrow for Miami,
return to New York (probably) and then depart for Europe next
Tuesday (the 8th) or thereabouts, He will be in his office in
New York until about 1700 this evening.
