Mr. George O'Rourke : :
0S/PSD/EAB 4 E 50 4 February 1964

The attached letter is forwarded
for your information and action.
Mr. Rorke Sr.'s statement that at
one time his son cooperated with
CIA in flights over Cuba is not
eorrect. We are also attaching for
your information copies of some of
the news articles that have appeared
on Rorke Jr. In the summer of 1960
00/C made a couple of contacts with
Rorke Jr. other than this there has
been no CIA interest in hin.
Alexander I. Rorke, Jr.. from infor=
mation available,appears to be a
mereenary and adventurer. We would
appreciate a copy of any reply sent
to Mr. Rorke 6r.

M/R: 201-280990 (3 Volumes )of FBI reports) reviewed. No Agency interest
other than 00/C in 1960. Also checked out with George Ladner who stated SAS
had no knowledge of what happened to either Rorke or Sullivan and had no
operational interest in either of these individuals at any time.
