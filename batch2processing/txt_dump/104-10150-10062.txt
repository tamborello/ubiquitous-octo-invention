From SE standpoint, we want Mr. Rvan's
name deleted wherever it appears (paecs

7, 8, 9 and 14). Also note error on pases
5 and 14 concerning date of FBI interro-
sation. hore 1963 appears on this pages
it should read 1964. Atherwise we have
not proklems with this as far as it soes,
but would like to see "sections to be
added."
