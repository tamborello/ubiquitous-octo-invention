work, It would be easier to put your line on
one of the other floors and rent an office

on that floor, They can rent an office in this

the junction box there they tie a six inch
piece of wire from your cable to their extra

‘the effectiveness of CG 6576-C*. It is pointed out that
should MARCY continue to feel that his line is tapped by the
FBI that he will merely refrain from the use of the phone
call:-for pertinent conversations. It is felt that this will
work to the advantage of the Chicago Division in that he will
