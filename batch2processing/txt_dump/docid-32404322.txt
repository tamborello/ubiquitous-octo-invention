MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Field Station Records

 

1. (U)The DO record schedule has been reviewed and approved
by the National Archives and Records Administration. It
states that that all information that meets retention
criteria is stored in the DO Records System at
Headquarters. Information retained in’the field is
strictly for convenience and may be destroyed when no
longer needed. All unique information must be sent to
Headquarters for retention purposes.

2. (S) This records’ maintenance practice serves two
primary purposes. First, in the.event of a hostile
situation the field office can destroy their files and
latter reconstitute them from information contained
within the DO Records System. Secondly, we can satisfy
DO search requirements by searching the records at
Headquarters. This minimizes delays in responding to the
request and minimizes impacts on field station personnel.

3. (S) The question specifically focused on Mexico City for
the years 1963-1964 and Moscow for the years 1959-1962.
We checked the record system to verify the fact and we do
not hold any separate file collections from Moscow or
“Mexico City field stations.
