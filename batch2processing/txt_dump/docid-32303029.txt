added that approximately three months ago while in
Washington, D. C., to visit a friend in the Greek Diplomatic
Service at the Greek. Embassy, he stopped at the Department
of Justice to say hello to MR, ANDERSON, but he was not in
Washington at the time. [7___] said that upon his return
to Pittsburgh, Pa., he received a personal note from _MR
ANDERSON apologizing for his absence and inviting LC]
to.make it a point to telephone him for lunch when he
visited Washington again. .

In the process of developing [| as an informant, he has
been instructed and reminded periodically to consider his
relationship with Special Agents of the FBI confidential

and to furnish information only to the Bureau. Nevertheless,
it seems reasonable to assum ecause of the closeness
of their alleged friendship, might disclose his
informant status to MR. ANDERSON and furnish information
regarding the activities of the MANNARINO brothers on his
next trip to Washington.

Consequently, in order to avoid a situation of potential
embarrassment, [____] is being deleted as a PCI of this
office. In the future, information will be accepted from
on.a voluntary basis and he will be considered a.
confidential source, °
