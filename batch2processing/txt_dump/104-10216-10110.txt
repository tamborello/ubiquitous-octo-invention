| - 1. Three AMNTRUNK operations, the foremost objective of each of
} ° which has been to re-~contact ANTRUNK-10 to broaden the base

i of MHAPRON recruitment in the ANTRUNK Project, have been mounted

: ' {n 1964, Two of the three have been partially successful but “
tL to date ANICE~14, the AMTRUNK leader, has been unable to make

} contact with AMTRUNK-10.

   

2. Opcration AMTRUNK VI was mounted in January 1964. This
was the operation in which AMTRUNK-9 and his family were ex-
Ziltratod. The unexpected presence of ANTRUNK-9's wife and small
children forced AMICE-14 to vacate the infil/exfiltration area
prematurely. All three attempts to launch Operation AMTRUNK vil
in February were unsuccessful largely because of rough seas and
the resultant difficulty in towing the AMTRUNK Intermediate Craft.
The firefight with the patrol craft in the first stage of the ine
filtration phase on Operation ANTRUNK VIII in March forced the
team to wait out the alert which their encounter had precipitated.

‘The team was able to emplace the AMLASH cache and to add to it
an OWVL receiver with instructions and schedules for AMTRUNK~10
as well as additional S/W supplies for AMTRUNK-10 and -il. An
S/W message containing the cache recovery plan was sent to

' AMTRUNK-10 shortly after the team's return to the JMWAVE area.

“ 3. With one notable exception, the above failures and
partial successes have constricted the AMTRUNK effort toward
MAAPRON recruiting at least until AMICE-14 should attempt another
