To the Kefauver Committee, one interest tha
GREENBERG revealed was real estate at San Bernardinoy
California, owned by "Store Properties, Inc." This’ was
named as part of a larger complex of real estate groperties
in which GREENBERG "and other unsavory character$" were ~
involved, and figuring in Store Properties was/again,

PAUL ZIFFREN.\,

Heading Store Properties, Inc. as president .
was SAMUEL GENIS:, now dead, who had been Anvolved in four
bankruptcies and ‘had been arrested. for passing bad checks.
He had vaulted "with curious ease" into control of multi-
million-dollar hotel and office-building holdings. When
he died in 1955 in ar accident, "his’estimated four-million-
dollar estate dwindléd mysteriously." ZIFFREN, said
VELIE, had supplied cash to GENIS/for Store Properties,
Inc., getting his money back in / wo years with rive per cent
interest and soon after\,receivii title to a portion of the
property at San Bernardino. .

   

When VELIE asked, ZIFFREN about his business
association with men like Anderworld figure ALEX GREENBERG,
ZIFFREN reportedly said, 'T\don't believe in character
assassination. GREENBERG was honorable in all the dealings

I had with him." VELIE's comment on this retort is,
"This tolerant attitude toword,a man who, while associated
with ZIFFREN, was also doing work for ruthiess criminal .
gangs, poses a big question... \Even if he wants to, can
a man shed associations such as ZIFFREN has had?"

T- 1 y the researcher who provided material from
which the"Reader's Digest" piece was drawn, has written
of ZIFFREN: ‘He is a man of power with deep. roots in the
hoodlum world, socializing on the highest level for the
benefit of press and public, with cali girls and gamblers
and the other denizens of the lower léyel when the camera
is closed" This source credits ZIFFREN with building
a lasting’ bridge between the underworld\and the overworld,
linking /"the outright criminal with his billions of illicit
dollars’ to the acceptable businessman whose needs for
investment capital recognizes no moral or \physical
boundaries." \
