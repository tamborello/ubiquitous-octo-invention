On August 13, 1965, MM T-2 reported that

GERVELIO GUTIERREZ.» also known as "MIMO," disclosed that ©
the MIRR needs two "lapiceros" as soon. as possible. MM
T-2 explained that a "lapicere" is the Cuban term for a
M-1 time delay device, which resembles a pencil.in size

and shape. This device is used in conjunction with a -
detonator for demolition purposes, and it enables the

MM T-2 advised that none of the membersof MIRR
have disclosed the specific manner in which they intend
to use- either the .57 mm. recoilless rifle or the
“lapicero." He speculated that BOSCH might intend to
tiount the .57 mm. recoilless rifle on a speed boat; and
