MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT : Gordon NOVEL

1. On 23 May Mr. Papich left with us a copy of attached
FBI teletype. FBI will confirm this information by formal
memorandum, : ae :

2. Mr. Papich requested information on two points with
permission to make our reply available to the Attorney General:

a) nature and extent of CIA interest in the
Double-chek Corporation. ; .

b) our comments and observations on the draft
‘letter purportedly prepared by Gordon NOVEL.

e nsultation with Mr. Jacob Esterline, DC/WH,  ---
Mr. SOD, and Mr. Lawrence Houston, OGC, the following
reply was given Mr. Papich:

- “*Double-chek is a "shell" corporation used 7
2 in the past b lots It was
a used as a front for the payment of the

thee! “Birmingham widows". No individual bearing
n Pan

Wie
wae
Spe Mr. Lawrence Houston is in constant touch

the name of Gordon NOVEL had any connection with

+-,, * "| Bouble-chek nor with CIA,

Bes

with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General,
Nathaniel Cossack, on this matter, and will
tell him about present developments.

yee Mr, Houston comments that anyone could

have prepared the letter but it really does
sound like NOVEL's cock-eyed approach rather
than Garrison. There is a fair chance that

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
NOVEL might have written it. ‘This will probably
make another headline for Garrison but we
don't feel it could do the Agency much damage",

4. On the question of the alleged gunshot fired at NOVEL,
Mr, Papich advised that the FBI is not investigating the matter,

It has not been confirmed as yet that anyone did shoot at NOVEL.
