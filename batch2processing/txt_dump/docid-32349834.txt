GYROSE

Source: Theodore D. OSTIER (P) ina face to face conversation.
with Jesus FERNANDEZ, and Orlando RODRIGUEZ Perez, the latter
is the 30 November delegate to the CRC, The arrangements
for the meeting were made on 23 December through the -good
offices of AMSHANK 1, The meeting was held on 24 December ...
and raw information was received by WAVE Reports on 27 December.
There is no additional information on the personalities
neationad The information is. being forwarded because of

her rumors and vague reports) of the struggle between 26 July
and the Reds, The source comments are based.on the facts as
reported in the comments, Little has been done to edit out
names because this seems to’ be! the whole point of support
for this rumor, WAVE Reporting may once again be bucking -
the general trend, but feel that 3 is warrénted though 6 is
probably the safe way out. No} dates of information were
provided other than as indicated. The rumor was recently.
received, so WAVE Reports has assumed mid-November, :

“
Danilo Mesa now at Gainesville! U. (para 3)
Re para 3 it is assumed that the "do nothing policy" refers

te the U.S, government.
