Brazil, he guessed it would be in the San Paulo area
of Brazil.

GERACI statedithat subject had no money
invested in Lehigh Acres for if he did, he, GERACI,
would know about it. GERACI also furnished some de-

~ tails concerning some Cuban persons whom subject
brought to his home in the past.

It would appear that subject's alledged
trip to Brazil above may relate to the disappéarance
for subject from Miami during the period 10/19/62
to 11/6/62. Efforts are being made to gain further
information in this regard.

On 12/21/62, TP 8-C advised he had received
information that in the past several weeks, subject
had been obser¥ed in an old model Nash automobile,
faded blue in color, and bearing a Florida license,
registration unknown.
