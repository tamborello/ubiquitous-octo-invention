as a result of investigation and surveillance by U. S. : fers

_29th Avenue and 9th Street, Miami, it was determined that
on the night of May 11, 1964, some unidentified Cubans
left this residence, went to’ a boat house located near
Miami International Airport on a lake and returned to the
same residence later that night with a homemade torpedo
ina car-drawn trailer. This torpedo was’ seized by U. s.

described this torpedo as being about nine feet long, about
» two feet in diameter. and constructed from a modified airplane
wing tank. This torpedo had an outboard propeller ‘and on
.. top an adapter for a radio antenna, which:appeared to be
part of the mechanism intended to make it operable by
electronic directional control. It also contained. an
‘electric motor, battery operated. The nose of the torpedo :
“ contained space for explosives but it was not loaded.
