1961, and that this accident had occurred at Johnstown, Pa.,
where the only witness was a policeman. Information from

. the informant indicated that his car had been hit from

behind, that he had sustained no personal injuries and
§200 damages were not severe but would cost more than
7200.

On July: 5, 1961, information was obtained which indicated
that the adopted son of LA ROCCA would come to work at
the North Star Cement Block Company in the very near
future but that his specific duties had not yet been
determined. Orders from LA ROCCA were given to the
effect that supervisory officials should not make fhe

job too easy or too inviting inasmuch as he would like
the boy to attend college.

On July 12, 1961, it was ascertained from the Intelligence
nit of the Internal Revenue Service at Pittsburgh that

   
   

Through the coverage
supplied by this informant it was ascertained that the
North Star Cement Block Company was contacted telephonically
by Mrs. VEY before she talked to Internal Revenue Service
Agents waiting to interview her on her front porch. She
feigned a severe heart condition and refused to cooperate
with Internal Revenue Service Agents. VEY, in the interim,
discussed the visit of the Internal Revenue Service Agents
with the informant and indicated that he was extremely
worried about his mother being subpoenaed and possibly
being responsible for sending him to jail through her ~
own ingnorance of legal procedure. He indicated that
he was extremely worried about a banking account at
the First Federal Savings and Loan Association in Bellewue,
Pa., and would seek legal counsel regarding this. Information
obtained from this informant was disseminated to the
Intelligence Unit of the Internal Revenue Service at
Pittsburgh and it was indicated by ROBERT MADDEN, a
Special Agent handling the investigation of LA ROCCA,
that this information was invaluable and would be utilized
immediately in conducting a further investigation of VEY
and his financial activities.
