LA 92-113

On October 11, 1969, LA 4476-C-TE advised that
in regard to ROSELLI's request of JOSEPH BREEN to come, to
Los Angeles and bring his Italian friend with him, source

’ has now learned that BREEN's friend is TONY PITCH, whose
true name 1s PITCHELLO(ph). Source said PITCH was in
Washington, D. C., and was unable to accompany BREEN, who
actually did come to Los Angeles as requested by ROSELLI,

Source advised that PITCH has a tour bus business
in Las Vegas and is associated with MAURICE FRIEDMAN who
operates excursion boats on Lake Mead, Nevada. Source said
that because Lake Mead 1s. property of the United States
Government, a permit must be obtained, probably from the
Department of Interior. Source further stated that PITCH
is interested in tying up his bus tours with the excursion
boats and source said that PITCH is probably putting boat
deals in his name, trying to get the deals.

LA 4467~-C-TE in association with OZZIE CURTIS,
JACK CHELDIN, IRWIN CHELDIN, and MILTON COHN (CPA) have
devised a method which will result in a 50 percent profit on
insurance on rental cars. In this regard, they have
arranged for financing of a rental car agency and contemplate
using a corporate name of "world Wide Rent-A-Car" (WWRC).
In addition to insuring WWRC automobiles, they will also
rent card from this corporation and contemplate insuring
rental cars for other rental agencies.

In an effort to establish Nevada business for
WWRC, JOHN ROSELLI suggested that source contact TONY
PITCHELLO, owner of Tony Pitch Travel and Bus Service,
Las Vegas, Nevada, for assistance, ROSELLI indicated to
source that PITCHELLO has the proper Nevada connections
and money in the right places.
