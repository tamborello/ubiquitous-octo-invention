"Jan. 6 1964

"On Dec. 7, 1963 NOEL TOTTEN visited the home of
CLUDE MC DONALD at 1621 5th St. North Minneapolis, ,
Minnésota, NOEL arrived about 11:00 A.M, and left his house
about 12:30 P.M. They discuss the assassination of President
KENNEY, and some of the questions on peace.

"MC DONALD said that the reason the President was
killed was because of the hate cémpaign which hase been build
up in this country over the past years. MC DONALD did not think
that there would be any change in the relation between the
United States and the U.S.S.R. as the present state of affairs
was not only President KENNEY'’s feelings, but also other
officers of the Government as well.

"MC DONALD ask NOEL TOTTEN if he would take the
“Worker” and NOEL said that he would and would come back around
the first of the year. and give him money for a Worker subscrip-
tion, .

"MC DONALD talked about the indictment of RALPH
TAYLOR and BETTY SMITH, saying that the judge desided to wait
until the HALL & DAVES case was settled before they would have
@ trial, if any.

"This is all I have to report."
