of ANTHONY DORIA in the indices of that office refers to
communications which were also designated for the Los Angeles

Information in this report pertaining to TONY TUCCELLI
was furnished by JACK D. WALLER, Manager, Delmonico's Restaurant,
828 South Robertson, Beverly Hills, California, who requested
that his name be held in confidence. WALLER gave his unlisted
telephone number at Delmonico's as OL 2-3884 and volunteered
to be of assistance to the Bureau should the need arise. He
resides at 12365 Sheldon, Sun Valley, California, telephone
number RO 7-2832. He indicated that his son is an officer in
the U. S. Navy, serving aboard an atomic submarine, and has
a secret clearance. He expressed dislike for TUCCELLI, claim-
ing that TUCCELLI is "on the bottle, a liar and unreliable."

He said he would like to fire TUCCELLI, but cannot, due to
his relationship with SCHEIB.
