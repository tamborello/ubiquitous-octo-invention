becoming a City Commissioner, was involved in an
abortion racket, that he has been a receiver of

- Cuban hoodlums in the Miami area, He is also sus-
pected by MM 1337-S, MM 1550-KS, and other reliable
informants, as well as by. some police officers, of
being involved. in narcotics on a high level in the
Miami area, Information has been received that.
REBOSO.- is collecting kick-backs for political favors.

: Previous investigation has reflected also

that MAX LESNICK, who conducted a radio broadcast

from Havana, Cuba, during the early days of FIDEL
CASTRO, always concluded his programs with the statement
“Cuba Si, Yankee No," LESNICK, according to MM 1337-S,
has bragged that. he "owns Miami." -He is

accompanied in his travels about the city by armed
bodyguards, according to reliable sources, and he

has been ‘involved in one altercation’ where he:

allegedly attempted ‘to: spull a gun: onvhis) victim

“during a street: scuffle, * He-is also suspected by —
‘reliable ‘sources and by ‘various: police’ officers of being

| . when he became General Manager. The hearing relates
‘ to an allegation concerning an advertising accounting
matter, JUSTO expressed the opinion that EATON had
‘been compelled at the last moment to support FUSTE
because of this pending hearing. He pointed out that
FUSTE has considerable influence and the support of
REBOSO and REBOSO's political connections. JUSTO said
that on or about 4/25/74, he was present during a
conversation involving FUSTE, REBOSO, and himself,
: ‘at which time JUSTO was trying to convince FUSTE
i to put ANGULO back on his job, At that time, REBOSO
i ‘yvemarked that he could talk to Congressman FASCELL
te at any time and could stop the FBI from. "harassing"
WFAB, JUSTO said that FUSTE suspects that ANGULO may
be working for the FBI and the police. JUSTO pointed
out that ANGULO's function as a news reporter requires
i : . him to visit the police and other investigative agencies
on almost a daily basis in order to acquire news for
broadcasting. JUSTO also said that” REBOSO. spends: four
or five hours with FUSTE: almost every day. “oe

On the same aay, MM 1337-8. expressed the ©

‘ opinion that FUSTE and: REBOSO; : through’: somé form of.

1 . pressure bordering on blackmail’ and extortion, have

. convinced Mr. EATON ‘to reverse his: position on the
matter of the hiring and firing: of ANGULO: and FUSTE,

The above information is set forth to reflect
what appears to be an interlocking conspiracy involv-
img members of several terrorist organizations, It
also appears that these terrorist organizations are
receiving aid and comfort either intentionally or
coincidentally from REBOSO and LESNICK,

Miami is pursuing investigation vigorously
in order to obtain evidence for prosecutable purposes
and to assist the police in any violations of a local
criminal nature involving these organizations and
individuals,

During the investigation of. the murder of
TORRIENTE, the police found a small scrap of paper,
presumably left by the assassin on the porch of
TORRIENTE’s home. This scrap of paper reflected

“WORRIENTE’s initials, bore a large "zero," and

underneath were the numbers "1 X 100H." Subsequent |

to that, some of the news media have received a

Spanish-language letter from "Zero," claiming credit |
for the assassination of TORRIENTE, In this connection,

‘it is interesting to note that the "Zero" organization

has surfaced shortly after "Accion Cubana" has submerged
