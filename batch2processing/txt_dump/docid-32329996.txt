"Julio" who asked him to tale a load of petrol to refuel another boat

at sea, WILLIAMS is the ower of the diesel-engined converted L.0.V.P.
the SUNSPORT registered in Florida with licence No, FL.5285A, WILLIAMS
was offered $100 a day for this job which he accepted, He subsequently

2, Ppeeeon 26th Geptembel the SUNSEORT with WILLIAMS as Captain and
accompanied by Paul HUGHES (see. Appendix A) left Biscayne Bay near Miami

to keep a rendezvous with a fast P,T, boat, the ALADINO, at Mira por vos '
Cays about fifteen miles southwest of Castle Island lighthouse, (Castle 1
Island is immediately south of Acklins Islend in the Bahamas).

3. The ALADINO is believed to belong to Rolando MASFERRER a
Supporter of the ex-Batista government in Cuba, This vessel, with

MS, twenty-seven anti-Castrolrevolutionaries on board, had left Miami at -
about the same time as the SUNSPORT, ‘The Captain was a Cuban called
GONZALEZ=<PADRON end the engineer another Cuban MARRERO-ORTEGA (See |
Appendix A), ‘The original intention was that the ALADINO should go
straight to Cuba and then return to the Castle .Island rendezvous where
she would be refuelled from the SUNSPORT, Owing to incompetent navigation
she ren aground several times on her outward journey through Bahamas waters:
and ren out of fuel, By the time AIADINO reached Castle Tsland lighthouse -
on about 1st October her.engines were in poor condition and it was not safe
for her to, proceed any further, The invasion party of twenty-seven men
was transferred to the SUNSPORT and on about 4th October were landed at a
point one and a half miles southeast of Baracoa light’ in Oriente Province,
Cuba where according to WILLIAMS they were given a hearty welcome by the
villagers,’ oe

. Le : The SUNSPOR? then returned to Castle Island and found that the.
i ALADINO: had gone aground hear the lighthouse, the anchor having broken..
. She is likely to become a total wreck, After a day's delay GONZATEZ and

MARRERO were taken aboard the SUNSPORT with five carbines, one rifle and
. twenty-two rounds of assorted 030, 38 and .45 ammunition which did not fit
the guns, According. to HUGHES these Weapons were withdraw from the invasic
party (who were armed with carbines, rifles and revolvers) because of their
doubtful serviceability,

 

be The SUNSPORT then set course for Nassau but as she was running
out of fuel put in to Georgetown, Great Exuma where she arrived on 7
October,” By this time the Bahamas police had got wind that something was,
. going on and thé four men were taken into custody. WILLIAMS and HUCHES

800 sten guns from some sympathises in South America to help further
invasions of Cuba and that he intended to operate off the Cuban coast with

a boat about the size of the ALADINO but which was more economical in fuel,
HUGHES alleged that the U.S, authorities boarded the ALADINO after she left
Miami but asked no questions about the large number of men on board, declined
to search for arms, and wished them good luck: and allowed them to proceed, _
