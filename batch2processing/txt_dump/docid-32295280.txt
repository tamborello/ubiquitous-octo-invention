Re Bureau airtel 11/28/61.

Los Angeles presently has 10 specific matters

discussed with informant.

Los Angeles has been making every effort to
get all of these matters resolved as promptly as possible;
however, informant has a very heavy personal scheduie and
refuses to schedule in advance the necessary time to

clear up all cf these matters.
