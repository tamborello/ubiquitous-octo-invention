3. (S) Mr. Blakey then turned his attention to the Agency's response to
his written request for any and all files onde Torres. Mr. Shepanek
pointed out that although there had been an earlier difficulty in locating the

HSCA had been given access to all files over a month ago. Mr. Shepanek
acknowledged that third agency documents were inadvertently left in the file
which was provided to HSCA researcher Edwin Lopez. Mr. Lopez took notes
upon these documents and submitted his notes for review at which time the

"error became known. The third agency documents, FBI items, were forwarded

to Mr. Coulson on 28 April (Friday) for FBI review and possible release to
HSCA. Mr. Coulson acknowledged that he had these materials and hoped to
make them available to the Committee at FBI Headquarters immediately
following the meeting.
