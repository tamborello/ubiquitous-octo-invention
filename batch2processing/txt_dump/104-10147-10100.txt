Addendum to Journal - Office of Legislative Counsel
Tuesday - 15 March 1977

 

4. (Unclassified - GLC) LIAISON During the course of the
‘day, I spoke twice to Richard Sprague, Counsel, House Select
Committee on Assassinations, to tell him that I would have to Tratge
With Admiral Turner his question about access to information on
Santos Trafficante but I wanted him to know that certain information
relating to the John F. Kennedy assassination had been released by -
our Freedom of Information people in response to several Freedom
of Information requests and that I was sending copies of that material:
to him today. I also mentioned that the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence and the Church Committee had had access to the type of
information he was desirous of seeing and the results of their inquiry
into this matter had been contained in the Church Committee's interim
report on assassinations, Sprague said he was aware of that report.
Later in the day, I called Sprague to tell him that I had talked with the
Director. The Director felt that in view of the President's serious
concern about the proliferation of sensitive intelligence information
he (Turner) did not feel that he could grant the Committee staff access
to any of the material in Agency files until suitable clearances had
been obtained and secrecy agreements had been executed. Sprague

did not quarrel with this decision and thanked me "for my efforts."
