conducted with both Agency and non-Agency witnesses. The
contacts with present and former CIA. personnel covered a

broad range of individuals, including staff and division

 

chiefs, clandestine case officers, area désk officers,

In total, more than 125 persons, including at least 50

present and former CIA employees, were questioned

regarding this issue.
The results of this investigation confirmed the
Warren Commission testimony given by Messrs. McCone and

Helms. There was no indication in Oswald's CIA file

suggestive in any way that he had ever had any contact with

the Agency. Moreover, the Agency employees who would have

been in a position to know if Oswald had been associated
