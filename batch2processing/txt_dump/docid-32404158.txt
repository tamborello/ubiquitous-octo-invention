. MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

FROM: R. M. Huffstutler
Executive Director

SUBJECT: Declassification of JFK Assassination
Documents

1. The purpose of this memorandum is to ask that the
Directorate of Operations take steps to speed up the process
of reviewing the JFK assassination records.

2. As you know, all agencies are required by law to
review for declassification, and transfer to the National
Archives by 22 August 1993, all records relevant to the
assassination of President Kennedy. As of 1 April, the DO
faced a backlog of some 57,000 pages just to catch up with
what has been reviewed initially by the Historical Review
Group. There will be an additional 135,000 pages to process
by 22 August. Although I realize that resources are scarce,
I believe that there is no option but to increase the level
of effort on this task if we are to meet the deadline.

3. The declassification of the documents will be
speeded up if the pace of the coordination process is
improved. In addition to the resource aspects, I am
concerned that coordination is being prolonged unnecessarily
because of what may be at times an overly rigid approach to
protecting sources and methods. The JFK legislation permits
withholding of information on sources and methods only when
there is "clear and convincing evidence" that release would
"demonstrably impair" national security.

4. OGC advises that the JFK legislation supercedes all
other statutory authority for withholding information
(except portions of the Internal Revenue Code). At the same
time, the information released under the Act does not
establish a precedent for purposes of FOIA and other
matters. The assassination records constitute an exception.
The Act allows us to protect genuinely sensitive information
such as names of agents, sources or methods currently in use
or expected to be used, and current foreign liaison
relationships.

5. Please remind the DO coordination officers of the
importance of being responsive to the provisions of the JFK

legislation that govern declassification of those particular
records.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director
VIA: Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence dA .

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: Review of JFK Assassination Documents

1. This memorandum is to advise you of a potential problem
regarding our capability for reviewing the Agency's JFK
Assassination records.

2. All government agencies are required by law to complete
the review of documents related to the JFK Assassination by
22 August 1993. The Agency has identified an estimated 250,000
pages of such documents. As of 1 February, we have processed
some 100,000 pages, which has taken about eight months to
accomplish.

3. At present we are processing the documents at the rate
of some 10,000 pages per month, with 14 HRG employees dedicated
to this task. Half of these are part-time annuitants. In
addition to the above 14 people, other HRG employees are
declassifying Soviet NIEs or documents requested by State for
(The latter is also a legal obligation.) We are faced with the
need to double the rate of review to 20,000 pages per month.

4. In addition to reviewing the remaining 150,000 pages, we
are required to fill out a form, called an identification aid,
for each document, which adds considerable time to the process.
We must also prepare such forms for most of the documents that
were reviewed earlier before the aids were available.

5. Until the review of the assassination records is
completed, we will be unable to devote resources to declassifying
other records, such as those on the Bay of Pigs and the
Guatemalan Coup of 1954. As you recall, former DCI Gates
committed the Agency to releasing records on those subjects and
others.
