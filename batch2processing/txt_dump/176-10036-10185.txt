“Mr. Colby. of Cla gave the current status of coup forces: He estimated
‘that the: pro-Diem. and anti-Diem forces. were about even, approximately
9800 on each. side,. with 18, 000 listed as neutral, The briefing-was illus-

= The ‘President askéd:what ‘Diem had learned-from the attempted coup __
"in 1960, -.Mz, Colby replied that Diem now had ‘much better communica- —
“tions: with military forces deployed outside Saigon, .He could thus call
: “into Saigon ‘rapidly loyal forces to-oppose rebel forces in the city. .The .

ue ‘Secretary Rusk ‘said. we > must assume. that Diem.and Nhu have heard

rumors about.a coup, The- ‘question for. us is: whether: we think there is —

- enough prospéct ofa successful coup to make the decision to keep silent.

Should we-let the. coup generals. ‘know that a- protracted ‘civil. war ‘must

. "not be the result: of their ‘efforts to- ‘overthrow Diem? . Should:we tell

them we would support them only. if the coup'is ‘short and-bloodless? If

, fighting between. the two sides takes place, : each will ask for-our: help.
: If we support ‘Diem, then we: will “disrupt the war effort because we will”.

~be acting against those generals ‘who are now. fighting: ‘the war against the

“Viet Cong. If we support the: rebel generals, . then we will have to.
