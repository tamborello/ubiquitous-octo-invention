NOTE: The subject is one of the most important underworld
figures in the nation, He attended the 1957 Apalachin hoodlum —
meeting and has a long history of racket activity in the New York-
Pennsylvania area, He is an important underworld figure in the
racket-ridden garment industry in New York-Pennsylvania, and is

in close contact with underworld leaders in that industry in

New York City. There is a definite ‘need to develop additional
information regarding subject's activity. PHO reports having a
unique opportunity to install misur coverage in the subject's
business office at the present time sincé he has requested telephone
service at his business office, This service will be installed on
6/9/64. A misur énstallation can be made by an SA of the PHO
acting under pretext of being a telephone installation man,

The cost of the leased line to monitor this source in the
PHO will be from $350 to $400 per month, This method of
monitoring the source at the PHO would be considerably less
expensive than the operation of a separatei;plant in the vicinity
of Pittston, Pennsylvania, which would also require tr: atisferring
ce ——an employee to the resident agency to monitor. In view of the
oh importance of Bufalino in the underworld, and since there is an
Callahan excellent opportunity to establish misur coverage with Vv

Conrad ___.
