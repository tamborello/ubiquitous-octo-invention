appeared not to be aware of any major purge and not to be concerned Sy
about it. However, if this is ‘true the chances for AMCLOCK/1 to be
reassigned abroad in the near future appear doubtful at this time.

4. When DI GERVENO asked AMCLOCK/1 about his work and how the
recent changes may affect him, the agent then reported the following
information about his position in the Foreign Ministry. After his
return in late December 1966 he was given four months vacation, during
which time he went by the ministry from time to time but had no job
assigned to him. He used most of this time for a honeymoon and to
relocate in his new home furnished by the PBRUMEN government. In the
SREI £ 1967 ¢lden Ciconsidered him actively as a substitute for

den Dowhom Qden does not like...However, the job did not materialize
‘because Iden C*s™plans t send den Das Ambassador to Canada were not
Paccepted sy den whom (Iden C*was going to send as Ambassador to

land. "Aw that time AMCLOCK/1 was also considered for a position
in (iden Piwhich was thé position the PBRUMEN President wanted him to
it AMCLOCK/1 avoided the position although it implied frequent
rEravels abroad. The reason AMCLOCK/1 gave for not taking the positio
at Gden Py was that he @id not want to break away from his diplomatic
career and felt he would be better protected among his friends in the
Foreign Ministry. Consequently, after his vacation AMCLOCK/1 want
pack to work in the Foreign Ministry but without any specific duties.
He is actually doing odd_joabs for Aden Cy Like economic studies, in

not been selected yet) which is to be created in the Foreign Minvetry
to make specific area studies ang recommendations to (ide if. Since
both AMCLOCK/1 and (iden @ have been assigned to the HTE
it is concluded that the creation of said “Advisory Committed 1a not
contemplated until early 1968. According to AMCLOCK /1 the creation
of this "Advisory Committee" has beer discussed at tne highest ievele

Operational Chronology

1. On 27 September 1967 AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1130 to
1530 for lunch at the Beekman site. The agent was not seen entering
or leaving the site and he stayed out of sight when food was brought
up from the restaurant downstairs. The meeting was conducted under
secure conditions and without interruptions. Only AMCLOCK/1 and ,
_, GERVENO were oe at the meeting. |

“The implication was that AMCLOCK/1 was still under observation by the
AMTHUG regime and (iden ‘actually told him to bend backwards in every

 

 

 

 

 
  
 

 

way possible to prove himself while in New York. AMCLOCK/1 explained
that this meant to live a model life while abroad and to perform extra
work whenever required, without complaining. AMCLOCK/1 believes that
(iden ‘B is being trained to take over AMCLOCK/1's position as an expert
Wn WSGconomics for the AMTHUG regime. teh this is the case, this may be
the last time AMCLOCK/1 is sent to Uden A> Still, under much probing,
AMCLOCK/1 could not come out with any clear indication that he was
suspected or was falling out of ‘grace with the AMTHUG regime. Although
the agent has a tendency to emphasize his “delicate” position, the
case officer believes that he is not mistrusted and still enjoys a
favorable position in the government, although probably considered too
bourgeois to be completely integrated with their communist philosophy.

\g the recent changes made in PBRUMEN diplomatic
AMCLOCK/1 was not aware of any security shake up

introduction
S54?
fh 1. AMCLOCK/1 arrived in New York on 19 September 1967.. He

een gaven instructions to call a JMWAVE operational number

(Iden A) ynext time he was cut in a friendly country in order to receive
%, GONTSEE instructions. When he failed to call soon after his arrival

it was decided to try to establish visual contact with him at HTBASTE,
same as was done successfully in 1966, to move him to call for contact _
instructions. For that purpose D1 GERVENO wag taken to HTBASTE on 7
21 September carrying a matcn folder from(den £ Biwith” ‘his alias,
and room number. The plan was to make sure AMCLOCK/1 recognized
DX GERVENO, who also met him in 1966, and to passa the match folde
to AMGDCK/1 only if this could be done securely. DI GERVENO was

 
 

  

   
 

  

 
 

 

 

 
   
 
     
  
  
 
   
  
  

able to make. de definite visual contact on four different occasions:

_ eA Uee yee 2 also manned im case “AMCLOCK/1 had retained this

and attempted to call DI GERVENO there instead of JMWAVE, but he

$3 failed to cali either place for contact instructions. It was then
decided to attempt to contact the agent again on 26 September at
HTBASTE. While attempts were being made to locate AMCLOCK/1 the
case officer surveilled "the building where AMCLOCK/1 is staying (iden BH)?
and saw him go in by himself at 1310 houys to leave his briefcase.”
At 1330 hours, AMCLOCK/1] left the buildind alone to go for lunch and
DI GERVENO followed him. AMCLOCK/1 recognized the case officer and
after exchanging safety signals DI GERVENO passed the match folder
to the agent while both were waiting on a crowded street corner for
the red light to change, at which time AMCLOCK/1 told DI GERVENO

that he hac no way to contact him and would see him after lunch.

Operational Chromlogy

3.__On 26 September AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1500 to 1830
i at dden By; AMCLOCK/1 appeared to be in good health and rested and in
high spirits. He was very glad to see LI GERVENO again and to be able
to discuss things openly. He criticized bitterly the living conditions
in PBRUMEN but does not seem to be affected by it or by the fact that
he had to live under a regime he obviously hates. In fact, he seemed
quite sure of himself and plans to return to PBRUMEN at the end of the
HTBASTE session. He is scheduled to remain in New York until December
1967 but may return to PBRUMEN before then for a short visit to look
after his ailing mother and his wife, who had a baby girl two weeks
prior to his departure. This may have influenced AMCLOCK/1 not to
think about a possible defection at this time, which came as a surprise
to the case officer who expected the agent to have second thoughts
about return to PBRUMEN where he is not happy.

     
   
  

4. AMCLOCK/1 explained that he could not make contact as instructed
hecause he had destroyed the phone number and both accommodation
addresses we had given him for him to report from inside PBRUMEN. He
destroyed them in the toilet at the airport upon his arrival in PBRUMEN
in late December 1966 after observing a number of uniformed individuals
at the airport which he considered to be suspicious, although they had
nothing to do with AMCLOCK/1. This may have been a convenient excuse for
his failure to make contact as instructed but DI GERVENO did not press
the issue. Instead he was given the operational numbers of the Beekman
site and of the Base in (fden LP and told he could always call
there if he could not locate DI GE {6 at den B> He was algo given |
the JMWAVE number for emergency contact. K/L said he tried to 4
make contact by callin Gden Feo inquire about MIDDAUGH in true name,

L poe aftsr-much-prowing he WHS told that MIDDAUGH was in Washington and
was given a phone number for him to call direct. AMCLOCK/1 was planning
to call Washington at a later day if he had not been contacted.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5. AMCLOCK/1 reported that he has had no security problems and
hag not been molested inside of PBRUMEN. He was treated “royally” by
the AMTHUG regime in early 1967 and everybody seemed pleased to see
him back. Apparently his return surprised some individuals who pri-
vately thought he would defect rather than return to PBRUMEN to live.
During this time he enjoyed special privileges and received frequent
invitations to official functions with foreign diplomats. However,
by mid 1967 the special privileges and invitations were gradually
suspended for no apparent reason. (For example, he was no longer
H allowed to take his private car to a government garage for repairs

and he had to arrange for themaintenance of his house, which was given
to nim and kept up by the government at first). AMCLOCK/1 believes
that this was due to his being under "observation" while going through
a reorientation period after his long stay abroad. There is nothing
to indicate that AMCLOCK/1 is not trusted or accepted by other govern-~
ment officials. The fact that he was sent out again. is: But rong

indication that he enjo,;s a favorable position in the AMTHUG regime.
He hopes that in 1968 he will be asgic¢ned to another permanent post
abroad.

 
     
        

6. In reference t. his w.fe AMCLOCK/1 stated that he is now
convinced that she is totally against the AMTHUG regime. After
their marriage in late 1966 he was not sure of her true political
ideology but during the past year he has been able to confirm her
disagreement on a number of occasions. He feels confident that she
would follow him in any movement against the regime, such as defection,
but has not told her about his work for woract. Gugvae AIAZ Dae. obits

8. AMCLOCK/1 was not seen going in or out of the room and the ~~

meeting was conducted without interruption under most secure condi-
tions. Di GERVENO established immediate rapport with AMCLOCK/1 and
their relations remained most cordial throughout the meeting. Only

DI GERVENO and AMCLOCK/1 were present.

  

 

      
 
 

 
 

     
 

 

9. DI GERVENG was careful not to mention salary payments to
AMCLOCK/1 who is not re af his salary increase to $1,000 a month
effective 1 January 1s However, he requested $500 to buy books |
and baby items for his daughter. DI GERVENO told him that he would
bring him the money in their next meeting. All payments to AMCLOCK/1
will be T/A'd to JMWAVE vogether with the agent's gigned receipts.
