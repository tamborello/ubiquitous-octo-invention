The FBI did not open a kidnapping case on the
John Paisley matter, although the FBI considered his
disappearance as a possible violation of the Federal
Kidnapping Statute, Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1201(b).
Information was received on a pessible violaticn on
September 29, 1978, from Walter Taylor, National Editor
of "The Washington Star," who advised that shortly after
&:60 a.w. Assistant Editor Kenneth Eichenberry (phonetic)
recelved a telephone call from an individual whe identified
hinself as Ghawzi Ullah, stating that they had hidnapped a
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee ramed Jotm
Taysle (phonetic). At-approzimately 10:00 a.m., Mr. Taylor

' received a second telephone call from Ghawzi Ullah stating

that Jotn Paisley, a CIA agent, had been seized by one of
their commandos in the Chesapeake Bay area. He stated that
Paisley was valuable to them for identification of “Zionist
Agents” in other. countries. Ghawzi Ullah made the following
demands for the "Muslim Council of War of lew York": (U)

1. the release of all Muslim prisoners;
2. $1,000,000.00 and; .
3, that Henry Kissinger be turned over to them. (U)

He stated that the specifie time and date would
be called in later anc that he wanted this action to be
published and widely circulated. He further stated thet
this was no joke; that it was not a game; and that it
affected the fate of "Islam." (U)

It should be noted that "The Washington Post"
on Friday, September 29, 1975, Page 81, contained an
article coreerning Paisley and his disappearance and that
he wae sost off his sloop somewhere in the Chesapeake
Bay. (U .

. Paisley's bedy was lecated in the Chesapeake Bay
on October 1, 1978. In view of the evidence not supporting
an actual kidnapping nor the crossing of a state line, the
FBI conducted no further investigation into this violation

' of the Federal Zidnapping Statute. (UV)
