SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka.,
AR

On 5/1/61, [ _]20 Lincoln Ave., New Kensington, Pa.,
(protect per request), advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III; as
follows:

  
   

Recently, information has come to him from New Kensington

gamblers that the Marbet Heating Co. Office, 1124 Fifth Ave.,

New Kensington, may be used as a central location for the counting
of illegal income by the Mannarino organization. Ostensibly tis
company is in the business of selling furnaces, air conditioners,
siding and other home necessities, but it is believed that this

is merely a front. -This belief is intensified when it is
considered that JOHN FONTANA, long considered KELLY MANNARINO's
top lieutenant, is the store manager. This company is in: the
process of moving from the above address to 1371 Fourth Ave.,
Arnold, Pa., about three city blocks away, and the company is
known to have a warehouse in the 800 block of Sixth Ave.,
Brackenridge, Pa. L____]will be alert for the presence of the R

Z

 

MANNARINOs and their underlings at this company's office and for
any activity considered inappropriate for the type of business
supposedly being conducted. .
