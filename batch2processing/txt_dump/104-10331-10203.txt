“ASSOCIATE DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL (INFORMATION)

End of JEK Review Board. As of 1 October, the JFK Assassination Records Review Board
(JFK Review Board) ceased to exist. In order to obtain more protection and processing time for

- Agency records related to the assassination of President Kennedy, OGC and OIM worked very hard

to negotiate with the JFK Review Board (before its termination) a comprehensive MOU that would
govern the fina! disposition of these records in a way favorable to the Agency. Although the MOU
was negotiated and ready for signature, at the eleventh hour, the FB! agreed to turn over to the
National Records and Archives Administration (NARA) all of its voluminous administrative records

concerning its implementation of the JFK Act. Citing this precedent, the JFK Review Board insisted

that CIA agree to do the same in the MOU, or the MOU would not be signed by the Board. Since in
the absence of an MOU we would have to turn over to NARA immediately all of the remaining
documents in CIA’s possession considered by the JFK Review Board to be assassination-related
records, OGC and OIM negotiated non-stop with the Board and its General Counsel and produced a
compromise which protects all of the Agency's interests. Specifically, the compromise dramatically
reduced the scope and numbers of administrative records CIA would be required to turn over to
NARA, while preserving intact all of the other provisions of the MOU favorable to the Agency.”
