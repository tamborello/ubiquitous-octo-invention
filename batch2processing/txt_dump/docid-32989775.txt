and Minneapolis airtel to Bureau dated 10/17/72, reflecting
results of first polygraph examination of RAY.

RaY was afforded 4 second polygraph examination
11/10/72 by SA HERBERT F, BRIICK, Chicago Office, at the
St. Louis County Jail, Duluth, Minnesotae “Waiver of
Rights" and “Consent to Polygraph Interview" forms were
signed by RAY. RAY’s attorney, JOHN DURFEE, ‘Duluth, was
present at the jall during the course of the examination
but was not present in the room during the course of the

- actual polygraph examination. Prior to the interview,

DURFER reiterated the stipulation that he would permit his
client. RAY, to take the examination only if the pertinent
questions asked were restricted to the PIPER kidnaping.

Based on the charts obtained today, 11/10/72,
it does not appear that RaY is directly involved in the
kKidnaping or that he knows who committed the kidnaping.

Sufficient reactions to controi» and guilt~complex-type
questions were obtained to provide a basis of comparison
with relevant questions. Additionally, no responses
indicating deception were noted during the "word Association
Test" in which the names of various locations actually
involved in the kidnaping were mentioned, along with names
ef no significance,

forms and questions asked are being retained in the Minneapolis

_ DURPEE further advised, confidentially, that he
did not believe that RAY would be a good polygraph subject,
inasmuch as he considered RAY to be a pathological liex,.

The charts of RAY‘ts responses to the various
pertinent questions in the examination tend to indicate
that he is not directly involved in the kidnapping, that he
does not knew whe committed the kidnapping, nor would he
refasa to tell the PBI if he knew who did kidnap Mrs. PIPER.

However, due to the restrictions placed on the test
questions by RAY's attorney, which prevent the establishment
of a suitable control question for relative comparison with
the pertinent questions: and further consideration of the fact
that RAY may actually be a pathological lier, the examiner's
opinion must be qualified, and the test results considered
indefinite. ,

RAY, during the examination, was a generally
ccoperative subject and made no apparent effoft to defeat
the purpose of the examination. It is noted, however, that
he refused to attempt to explain his responses on the charts
to the question, “Was the money you spent since last July part
o£ the PIPER ransom?" He firmly stated that he had told the
FBI about the source of this money which he had obtained prior
to the PEPER kidnapping and he refused to discuss it amy further.

At the end of the examination period, RAY stated
that he would be willing to continue the examination at a
later date in an effort to definitely establish his innocence
in xegard to the PIPER kiduappinge
