* During this same period of time, the "Jacksonville
Journal" ran an article concerning JOHNSTON's testimony
before the Kefauver Committee which conveyed the impression
that he had been associated with the hoodlum element and
that he had been linked with them. JOHNSTON in interview —
with Bureau Agents advised that he went to the newspaper }
and threatened to sue them for slander if a general j
retraction of this article was not printed. At that time as
JOHNSTON stated, "I am not and have never been connected ; we

in any way with the CAPONE mob or any other mob."

- During our investigations in the Criminal Intelli- a
gence Field, no information has been received which would in-. ©. cet
‘dicate that WILLIAM H. JOHNSTON, SR., is in touch with local ~~ ; i
hoodlums, nox has there previously been any information re- wo

tions and as O'HARE was in no position to. refuse, O'HARE's oe i
holdings were partly given to some of CAPONE's henchmen, names - i
unknown. O'Hare trusted JOHNSTON and named him beneficiary
of some of his business interests which.included the Jackson-
ville dog track. About twelve years ago, O'HARE had his head
