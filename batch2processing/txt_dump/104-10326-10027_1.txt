~ [___}

FOLLOWS ARE THE GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF
RECORDS : ‘

*DISCLOSURE OF<ASSASSINATION>RECORDS OR PARTICULAR INFORMATION IN
* <ASSASSINATION>RECORDS TO THE PUBLIC MAY BE POSTPONED SUBJECT TO
THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS ACT IF THERE IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING
EVIDENCE THAT--

{1) THE THREAT TO THE MILITARY DEFENSE, INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS,
OR CONDUCT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES POSED BY THE
*PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE<ASSASSINATION>IS OF SUCH GRAVITY THAT IT
OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC INTEREST, AND SUCH PUBLIC DISCLOSURE WOULD
REVEAL- -

(A) AN INTELLIGENCE AGENT WHOSE IDENTITY CURRENTLY REQUIRES
PROTECTION

(B) AN INTELLIGENCE SOURCE OR METHOD WHICH IS CURRENTLY UTILIZED
BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND WHICH HAS NOT BEEN OFFICIALLY
DISCLOSED, THE DISCLOSURE OF WHICH WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE
CONDUCT OF INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES; OR

(C) ANY OTHER MATTER CURRENTLY RELATING TO THE MILITARY DEFENSE
INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS OR CONDUCT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE
UNITED STATES, THE DISCLOSURE OF WHICH WOULD DEMONSTRABLY IMPAIR
THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES.

*(2) THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE<ASSASSINATION>RECORD WOULD
REVEAL THE NAME OR IDENTITY OF A LIVING PERSON WHO PROVIDED
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND WOULD POSE A
SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THAT PERSON;

*(3) THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE<ASSASSINATION>RECORD COULD
REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO CONSTITUTE AN UNWARRANTED INVASION OF
PERSONAL PRIVACY, AND THAT INVASION OF PRIVACY IS SO SUBSTANTIAL
THAT IT OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC INTEREST;

*(4) THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE<ASSASSINATION>RECORD WOULD
COMPROMISE THE EXISTENCE OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF CONFIDENTIALITY
CURRENTLY REQUIRING PROTECTION BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT AGENT AND A
COOPERATING INDIVIDUAL OR A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, AND PUBLIC
DISCLOSURE WOULD BE SO HARMFUL THAT IT OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC

SECRET

INTEREST, OR

*(5) THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE<ASSASSINATION>RECORD WOULD
REVEAL A SECURITY OR PROTECTIVE PROCEDURE CURRENTLY UTLIZED, OR
REASONABLY EXPECTED TO BE UTILIZED, BY THE SECRET SERVICE OR
ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE WOULD BE SO HARMFUL THAT IT
OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC INTEREST.

3. BECAUSE OF THE TIME CRITICAL NATURE OF THIS REQUIREMENT,
REQUEST ‘THAT YOU ASK IDEN FOR AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND REQUEST
THAT RESPONSE BE CABLED BACK TO HEADQUARTERS VIA IMMEDIATE
PRECEDENCE .

ALL PREVIOUS RECIPIENTS OF THIS LETTER HAVE HAD CONCERNS OR
QUESTIONS; FOLLOWING ARE ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY,
ASKED QUESTIONS:

*A, WHY IS MY NAME IN THE<JFK ASSASSINATION>RECORDS?

WE DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY BUT YOUR NAME MAY HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN A
CABLE OR DOCUMENT, OR YOU MAY HAVE COORDINATED OR SIGNED A CABLE
*OR DOCUMENT WITH REFERENCE TO THE<ASSASSINATION.>

B. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

IT MEANS YOUR NAME WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE PUBLIC RELEASE OF ALL
*DOCUMENTS PERTINENT TO THE<ASSASSINATION.> THE DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN
RELEASED TO THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION
(NARA) WITH THE NAME REMOVED AND IF WE DO NOT MAKE A COMPELLING
CASE THE PRESIDENTIAL BOARD WILL RELEASE NEW VERSIONS OF THE
DOCUMENTS WITH THE NAMES.

C. WHAT EXACTLY DOES "RELEASE" MEAN?

IT MEANS THE GENERAL PUBLIC WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENT VIA
NARA. THERE ARE PROFESSIONAL RESEARCHERS WAITING FOR ACCESS TO
THE MATERIAL SO THAT THEY CAN RESEARCH THE VARIOUS CONSPIRACY
THEORIES. WE KNOW OF SOME ORGANIZATIONS THAT WILL MOST LIKELY PUT
THE INFORMATION IN COMPUTER SYTEMS SO IT CAN BE EASILY SEARCHED.

D. WHAT IF I DON’T WANT MY NAME RELEASED?

YOU AND WE WILL HAVE TO CONVINCE THE PRESIDENTIALLY APPOINTED
REVIEW BOARD THAT YOUR SITUATION MEETS THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN
THE GROUNDS FOR POSTPONEMENT OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS. (TO
BE ABSOLUTELY FRANK, THIS IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DO AND THE
VERY FEW CASES WHICH WE HAVE WON HAVE BEEN BASED ON VERY SPECIFIC
AND COMPELLING REASONS. }

E. WHAT DO I DO NEXT?

IF RELEASE OF YOUR NAME IS NOT A PROBLEM, PLEASE ADVISE. IF YOU

DO NOT WANT YOUR NAME RELEASED, YOU NEED TO ADVISE US OF THAT FACT

AND EXPLAIN IN DETAIL WHY RLEASE WOULD BE HARMFUL TO YOU AND

NATIONAL SECURITY. WE HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST RELEASE ON THE

PRINCIPLE OF THE COVER MECHANISM WITHOUT SUCCESS TO DATE, AND WE
