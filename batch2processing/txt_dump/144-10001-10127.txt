Dear Tom:

In connection with the Select Committee's investigation of
the assassination of President Kennedy, we earlier received ~
answers to certain questions put to NSA. Since then we have
examined other material pertaining to NSA's contribution to :
the Warren Commission's investigation and we desire further in-
formation from NSA.

. By way of background for this request, we note the Warren
Commission provided NSA various documents and asked NSA to re-
view them for any cryptological significance. NSA found no
eryptological significance and its report of this fact was pub-
lished by the Commission.

1. By letter of July 10, 1964, (a copy of which is attached)

Mr. Rankin provided General Blake a co of certain document

requested by Dr. Tordella for NSA's files. Since NSA's analysis

of the documents was apparently co Teted at the time of Rankin's

Tetter we wish to know why NSA wanted to keep these docume

for its file. Further, we wish to know what use, if _ any, was

made of these.documents and what results relevant to the assassina-

tion were obtained from such use. , .

2. In a Commission staff internal memorandum, discussing the

documents provided NSA, it is reported that NSA is “primarily

interested in names," and NSA claims it has "information on names
sO, which the CIA does not have." Assuming these statements a

curate, we wish to know what significance such names would have _

“POr-SEEREE-

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY
OF DEFENSE (INTELLIGENCE) -

SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee Queries to NSA Concerning
the Warren Commission

Reference your letter dated 14 January 1976 transmitting
a request from Mr. Alton Quanbeck of the Senate Select
Committee Staff. The following information is provided in
response to Mr. Quanbeck's letter, keyed by paragraph to
his letter (inclosed - see underlined portions). Most of
the information was made available to the SSC Staff, Mr. —
Jim Johnson, during an interview with Dr. Louis Tordella
on 20 January 1976.

Para. 1. -. NSA requested permission to retain
photocopies of those reports on which we had worked merely
as record copies of our efforts on behalf of the Commission.
It was felt that if a question should arise at that time
concerning what analytic efforts had been involved and the
number of manhours expended, a record copy would prove useful.
No operational use was made of these documents except to
hold them on file for a period of time which cannot now be
determined. To the best of our present knowledge, the photo-
copies have now been destroyed. Absolutely no results
relevant to the assassination were obtained through NSA's
analytic look at the exhibits. The Commission, in the person
of Mr. Allan Dulles, had asked Dr. Tordella, informally, to
review the exhibits for any secret writing or codes which.
might have been contained in the documents. Dr. Tordella,
after causing ‘a careful review of the documents by NSA crypt-
analysts, reported verbally to Mr. Dulles and other Commission
- members that nothing whatsoever had been achieved by the
analytic effort. No written reply was submitted.

Para. 2. - NSA is uncertain as to what is precisely
meant by these comments, but we assume that the comments on
names refer to our biographic files which are maintained on.
foreign personalities of potential intelligence significance.
As the Committee knows, these biographic files are maintained
(now at CIA incidentally) as analytic support. It is also
possible that the Commission was referring to the fact that
names are frequently seen in traffic collected for foreign
intelligence purposes and therefore NSA might have access
to foreign names not otherwise available to the Intelligence
Community.

Para. 3. - It. may well be that CIA did obtain such
transmissions and pass them to NSA for analysis, but no one
presently working that analytic area recalls such a request.
Discussions with Dr. Tordella also failed to shed any light
on this subject. There are no files or records which we have
been able to locate from that time frame which would sub-
stantiate such a claim. In fact, the only file the responsible
analytic group has been able to locate concerning a request
from the Warren Commission deals with a file compiled from
open sources citing major dates in the last months of Oswald's
life. Presumably the date file was to be compared with NSA
product on/about the key dates in-the hope that something
could be deduced. The file does not contain any "hits."

The analysts who performed this effort have since retired.

Para. 4. ~ The informal request from Mr. Dulles is
the known total extent of NSA's role in assisting in the
investigation. The: file discussed in Paragraph 3 is the only
file thus far recovered. There is no information which can
now be identified which was developed from Cuban or Soviet
transmissions relating to the assassination. .

y

Para. 5. - We have no information on this subject
at all. However, pursuant to the subject raised during the
Tordella interview, we have searched our files manually,
and as Mr. Lowman agreed during the Tordella interview, we
have recovered three product reports (Inclosures 2 through
4) which show that Cuban military forces did go on alert
immediately after the assassination. There is no SIGINT
evidence, however, that the Cuban forces were alerted prior
to the assassination, thereby suggesting that they had prior
knowledge of the event.
