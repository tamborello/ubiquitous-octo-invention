Dear Bob:

Herewith are comments on the new version of the Defector
paper and the Cuban paper. These comments were prepared in my
absence by those on whom I have leaned during this phase of the
inquiry.

I note the "Mongoose" reference, a basic factual comment.
I also note the “golden boy" reference. Someone may have referred
to the man that way, but it was not a categorization in general use.
Makes interesting reading but is more literary than reliable, for
the impression it conveys. Further, it indicates a tie we feel
should be protected. :

Sincerely,

a
ete ee es

Veciana 31, paragraph 201, line 6. Insert “contribution” after "$500";

meeting convened in Puerto Rico by Veciana to raise funds for ALPHA yer
66; a U.S. Army directed operation". Delete "financier and industrialist, a :
Codename SKEWER-1, with whom the CIA had a long-standing operational aS cael
relationship”. Four lines later, beginning with “or the industrialist", ' 2
delete remainder of paragraph. Paragraph should read as follows: “and 2".

even though the Agency later used the Puerto Rican as a conduit for the VA
passage of U.S. Government funds to selected anti-Castro groups, it

appears that in Veciana's case, the money was provided solely by the

Puerto Rican from his personal funds.
