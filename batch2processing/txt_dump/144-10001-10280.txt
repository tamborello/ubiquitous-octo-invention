1. The alert in Oriente province, apparentl rompted by the
assassination of President KENNEDY, is believed: to have
terminated on 25 November (2027.1). Access to the coastal

observation post at Punta Maisi was restricted only until (25

November, and Eastern Naval District units, which were to receive

further instructions regarding the alert on 25 November, ‘have

apparently not received any such orders. Further, the Cuban navy
held an island wide communication ekercise on 25 November. Such

an exercise is unlikely under alert conditions. (2/o{___R58-63,

2602192)

 

B-1 Comment: It is possible that the restriction regarding access
to the Punta Maisi observation post extended to other observation
posts in Oriente as well,and that the restriction was to be lifted
on 25 November by all of these posts.
