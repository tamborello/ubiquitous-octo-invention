ay persons, who give private English lessons in théir home to advanced
language students,

   
 
   
   
  
 
   
   
    
   
 
  
 
 
   
   
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
    
    
 
   

 

6. AMPAUNA~13 began studying with Identity 2... Before long he
noticed that other students appeared to be giving intelligence infor-
mation to the ladies,. Eventually he told Identiti 2and 3 that he had
a channel for getting such information to PEPRIME if they caved to use
it. They did, and AMFAUNA-13 was now receiving intelligence reports
from theif Which he passed to AMPFAUNA~1,

7,.. Reconstructing what happened subsequently, AMFAUNA~13° reasons

 

‘that: Identit andestine relations <2,

AMFAUNA~13, The first that AMFAUNA-~13 knew of this was in about October
1962 WheH“AMFAUNA-36 told him that AMBIT~2 had warned her to beware of

the man in’the apartment below hers (AMFAUNA~13)--who he said was "working

foe ODENYY." ‘AMFAUNA~36 said she had told AMBIT~2 that he had gotten ATS
a

cts mixed up, and that the man who,had been working for ODENVY was a

dogtor who lived around the corner and who had already been sentenced for
eounterréevolutionary @& T Se

8. AMPAUNA-13 then consulted with AMFAUNA-1_who told him that this
was a dangerous situation-and that he had bether stop receiving reports
from Identity 2 and Identity 3, AMFAUNA-13 therefore told them that his
contact had ieftCuba and that he had no other way of getting their i

 

reports out. Id 3. to him that this was all right because she

had another outlet,

9... In about July 1963,-AMFAUNA-13 was told by a certain "Auréliot,
a -stevedorée in the Havana docks whom AMFAUNA-13 had originally met when
he was damage control inspector at the docks, that a ship had arrived
at the Muelle Hacendado in about May 1963 carrying an undétermined
number of Chinese in civilian clothes.

10, About two weeks later, while taking his English lesson from
Identity 2, AMFAUNA-13 heard Identity~3's pupil tell her that about 500
Chinese had arrived by Ship in Havana, and that some of them were
replacing Russians at the San-Antonio de los Banos air base, Identity.3

not put much stock.in this report, but that if it were true it was
important and that they should try to verify it. T ounts: for the
