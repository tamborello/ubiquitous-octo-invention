On the night of March 21, 1961, another source ;
who has furnished reliable information in the past, reported
that Orlando Bosch, who is a civilian delegate of the-
Movimiento Insurrecional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria
in Miami, learned of the seizure by Cuban authorities of
this group in Cuba. He identified Marciano Belo, also
known as Guajira; as being among this group. Bosch confided
the group had been taken by the boat "Jolly Roger” to a
point off the coast at Cabanas, Pinar del Rio Province,
where they were transported by skiff to the shore at which
point they were apparently apprehended.

 

On. March 22, 1961, Inspector Willis Smithson
of the United States Border Patrol, Miami, advised that on
March 11, 1961, the "Jolly Roger" was reported in the
Florida Keys with Angus K.. McNair, Jr., and cight unnamed
' _Cubans on board. On March 12, 1961, the "Jolly Roger" was
reported in the Key West, Florida, area with Elidio C. Sur
y Goichoheca, Cuban alien, on board. On March 19, 1961, the
"Jolly Roger” arrived at the Lower Matacombe Key near Key West
. and as of March 22, 1961, it was at this location having
‘leaded eight - 55«gallon fuel drums on board. Captain
Enrique Rodriguez Ibanez of the “Jolly Roger" has been
‘ordered to report to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service at Hiami. .

 

{

- On. March 21, 1961, the Central Intelligence Agency IS
advised the captured group could possibly be an independent
operation of the Frente Revolucionario Democratico, an
anti-Castro unity. organization, but that Central Intelligence
Agency had no operational interest in this matter and it is

' din possession of no knowledge regarding the "Mercury." BG) GR. a J
