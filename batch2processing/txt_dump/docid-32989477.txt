~ By William Safire

 

WASHINGON, Nov. 19—On Oct. 10,-
1963, the then-Attorney General of the
United States put ‘his personal signa-
i cure on a document that launched and

ingitiraatized one of the most horren-
dous abuses of Federal police power in
this century.

In Senator Frank Church’s subcom-
mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and subse-
quent unauthorized bugging and at-
tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther
King Jr. is being gingerly examined,
with the “investigation” conducted in
such a way as not to unduly em-
| barrass officials of the Kennedy or
Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has
. focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, when?
the committee counsel first set forth .
the result of shuffling through press
clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-:
"partment had existed in 1962; today,’
_ an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it
was Robért Kennedy who authorized
| the wiretap of Dr. King, and that “the
President of the United States and the
attorney General specifically discussed
j their concern of Communist influence
| with Dr. King.”
| But the Church commiltee showed
no zest for getting further te the Ken-
nedy root of this precedent to Water-
gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church
were willing to let the chips fall where
they may, he would call some knowl-
edgeable witnesses into the glare of
the camera lights and ask them some
questions that have gone wnasked for
thirteen years.

For example, he could call Nicholas
Kaizenbach, Attorney General Ken-
nedy’s deputy and successor, and ask
what he knows of the Kennedy de-
cision to wiretap Dr. King. Who at
Justice concurred in the recommenda-
tion? How does the F.B.I. know the 4
President was consulied or informed? +

Afler Mr. Katzenbach assumed of-'
fice, and the wiretapping continued, y
ine was told by angry newsmen that
the F.B.I. was leaking scurrilous in-
formation about Dr. King. Why did he
ssait for-four months, and for a thou-
sand telephonic interceptions, to: dis-
continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sort of testimony
would erode Senator Church’s poiitical
pase. That is why we do not see for-
mer Assistant FBI. directory Cartha
(Dekc) Deloach, Lyndon Johnson’s
nersenal contace with the F.B.1 in the
witness chair. What did President
Johnson know abeut the character-
assassination plot and when did he
Knew i<? What conversations took
ace b-tween Mr. Deloach and Presi-
a. Johnson on the tapping of Dr.
King, or about the use of the FBI in
any ather intrusions into the lives of

Mr. Church’ SqgCover-Up

“The committee is not asking amibar-
rassing questions even when answers
are readily available. A couple of
weeks ago, at an open hearing, an
F.B.I. man inadvertently started to
blurt out an episode about newsmen
who were weritapping in 1962 with

. the apparent knowledge of Avomed

General Kennedy. The too-willing wit
ness was promptly shooshed into si,
lence, and told that such informatio
would be developed only in executive
session. Nobody raised an eyebrow.
That pattern of containment by the
Church committee is vividly shown by
the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican and Democratic con:

ventions which were ordered by Lyn-
don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-
cal headquarters were worse than the
crime committed at Watergate, since
they involved the use of the ‘F.B.L,
but the Church investigators seem to
be determinet! not to probe too deeply.

If F.B.I. documents say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why .are those men not given the
same opportunity to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent’s men? If Lyndon Johnson com-
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the F.B.I. to spy on political
opponents, Who can be brought for-*
ward to tell us all about it? '

But that would cause embarrass-
ment to Democrats, and Senator
Church wants to embarrass profes-
sional employees of investigatory
agencies only. A new sense of Con-
gressional decorum exists, far from
the sense of outrage expressed in the
Senate Watergate committee’s hear-
ing room. When it is reveaied that the
management of NBC News gave press
credentials to L.B.J.’s spies at the 1964
convention, everybody blushes demure-,
ly—and nobody demands to know}
which network executive made what:
decision under what pressure.

I have been haranguing patient
readers for years about the double
standard applied to Democratic and‘
Republican politica! crimes, and had
hoped the day would come when the
hardball precedents set by the Ken
nedy and Johnson saen would be lai
before the public in damning detail.

Obviously, Democrat Frank Churc!
is nol the man to do il, His jowl
shaking indignation is all too sclec
tive; the trail of high-level responsi
bility for the crimes committed agains
Dr. King and others is evidently acing
to be ellowed t cool.

Pity. You'd think that after all the
nation has been through iz the past
few years, our political leaders would
have learned that the one thing that
brings you down is the ct of cover:
