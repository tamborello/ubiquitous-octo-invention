Smoke Shop and his wife, ANN, worked on Water Street. (Water

Street was the red light district in Steubenville). CICCARELLI

was granted a divorce from his wife, ANN, on 9/25/53. The . -
files contained a notation that the 10/9/58 edition of the
Jeffersonian Newspaper, &. Steubenville Weekly newspaper, i
carried an item that CICCARELLI'S name had been legally

changed to LOUIS VINCENT CASE, The last known address of

CICCARELLI (CASE) was 3062 Southwest 16th Street, Miami,
Florida,. according to the records of this credit bureau. '

On 11/10/58, CI 197-S advised SA ROBERT R. .
ROCKWELL that CICCARELLI was in Steubenville during the past
month period. During this time he spent time with PHIL
MATTUCCI, a local gambler, and he frequented a newly. opened
gambling establishment known as the Rainbow Gardens located
just out of town. The informant thought that it appeared
that CICCARELLI was.interested in working up some kind of
local "deal" in the gambling business in town. He apparently ;
was not successful as he is reported to have returned to
Florida. On recontact on 3/16/59 this informant advised
that he has not seen CICCARELLI since he left last year and
as gambling in town is having.a hard time, he probably felt
he could do better back in Florida.

Miami will locate and interview CICCARELLI, aka.
Case,re his association with subject. .

SUBJECT IS SAID TO CARRY SMALL CALIBER GUN AND WAS
ARRESTED IN 1943 FOR CARRYING A .38 CALIBER REVOLVER; SHOULD
BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
