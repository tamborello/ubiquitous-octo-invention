4. In the early debriefing of Mr. Nosenko, it became
apparent that he was a particularly complex individual, To permit
exzensive and prolonged debriefing, arrangements were made to

accormmodate Mr. Noserko under highly secure conditions at |
ISOLATION, where he remained from 1964 to 1967, These tight
Security arrangements were dictatéd,, during the initiel phases at
least, by the additional need to provide Mr. Noseniko with
continuing personal protection, since there was the distinct
possiblity that he would be targeted for execution if the Soviets
should discover his whex -eabouts.

 

 
 
 

5. Since October 1967, the primary responsibility for Mr,
Nosenko has been in the Office of Security, which conducted a
thorough review of prior developments in the s case. Mr. Nosenko
was moved to the Washington, D.C. area in jate 1967, and the :
case passed through various stages of phesed normalization, as
he was given an increased degree of freedom and independence,

Mr. Nosenko was actually resettled on the econ mnomy in April 1969;
he obtained a divorce from his former Soviet spouse in Septe:aber
1969; and he later married an American girl in October 1969,

. During the period from October 1967 to April 1969, Mr. Nosenko |
did not receive a salary, but he was provided with a moderate
amount of spending money. ~

& As of April 1969, Mr. Nosenko signed a one-year

contractual agreement for $16,500.00, including a clause giving

Ssistence to him in resettlement expenses the amount .of

$3, 000,00, In March 1970, Mr. Nosenko si goed a new contract

was provided with certain financial assistance, $20,000.00 -

“1. This memorandum submits a proposal. for. your approval.
The. proposal is to immediately. pay Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko -
$28,500 in back salary in settlement of an Agency commitment
to him and to authorize a subsequent one- time payment of 10, DOG~
to him ¢irectly or as a contribution to-his retirement for -
identifying a ranking British official William Vassall, as “an
L recruited Soviet agent.

 

     

     

Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko is a 48- year- old former

- intelligence officer who is currently employed as an
independent contractor by this Agency. Mr. Nosenko has for
isome time been of the opinion that he is entitled to $28,500
‘in back pay. .This amount represents the difference between ».
‘the salary actually paid to him during the 1 March 1969 to
1 March 1975 period and the $25,000 per year which was promised
to him at the time of his defection in February 1964. At the
time of his defection, Mr. Nosenke was also pronised the addi-.

work as an agent in place. On 15 June 1962 Mr. Nosenk
returned to the Soviet Union where he resumed his duties as.
‘an intelligence officer with the Second Chief Directorate. of:
the KGB in Moscow. Mr. Nosenko worked in place in the Soviet... i °.
Union until January 1964 when he returned. to Switzerlund. “At 0 °°.
that time Mr. Nosenko decided to defect and requested political ©

asylum in the United States. coe ee ee oe

-1964 and was brought to the United States under. Public Law 110 0°":
cn ll February 1964. At the time of his defection, certain _
financial commitments were made to Mr. Nosenko, These cowmit-...°

ments were substantiated in a conversation with him on .

7 February 1964 and were documented in a 10. February 1964...
memorandum to the Acting Deputy Director. for Plans from. “
Mr. David E. Murphy, Chief, Soviet Russia Division (SR Division). —

‘This memorandum stated as follows:

-"First, I assured Subject [Mr. Nosenko] that L.

was satisfied that he was genuine. | Based on. vies
_this and assuming his continued ‘cooperation’ .
I said we would proceed to. make arrangements oe
to bring him to the States. Second, I con- ©
firmed ovir agreement to pay him $25,000 for

each year in place ($50,000}-plus $10,000 for
his part in the Vassall case and our readiness
to contract for his services at.$25,000 per.
year. Third, I explained the polygraph he

would be expected to take as final. proof. of.

his bona fides." : os :

  

 

5. Shortly after his arrival in the United States, the
SE fivision encountered serious difficulties in attempting to
establish the bona fides of Mr. Nosenko. The SR Division con-~.
cluded that Mr. Nosenko was not what he claimed to be and thus
was not @ bona fide defector. As noted in paragraph. four of
Attachment A, Mr. Nosenko was held under highly secure conditions
at an Agency installation from April 1964 until October 1967.
In October 1967 the primary responsibility for Mr. Nosenko was
transferred from $2 Division to the Office of Security, which
conducted a thorough review of the developments in this case.
‘he conditions of confinement of Mr. Noseako were progressively
xed and in Qctober 1968 the bona fides of Mv. Nosenko vere
