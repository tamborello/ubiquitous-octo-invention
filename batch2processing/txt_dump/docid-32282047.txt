Bosch denied stating that he believed Castro should be eliminated and
that Castro's elimination was well worth $150,000.

Bosch ig acquainted with Teofilo Babun Selman, another Cuban
exile, but he does not know Eabun's associates, Eliseo Gomez Fernandez
‘and Oscar Fernandez Veiga. Babun was not one of the two Cubans who
called on him recarding the plan and Bosch cannot recall for certain
if he mentioned this plan to Babun. LPosch is acquainted with Julio Lobo,
still another Cuban exile, but he did not and would not ask Lobo for
anything. Eosch indicated he thoroughly detests Lobo and would not
enter anything of which Lobo is a part. Bosch further stated he did
not know Byron Cameron, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, businessman.
