Captain GUTIERREZ BARRIOS has been yecontacted one :
several occasions with respect to the foregoing matter and
advised on 5/18/65 that BARRAGAN has proved to be extreme]; ‘
difficult to locate for interview. Furthermore, as a result Lah
of his additional inquiries concerning BARRAGAN, he has become :

\. definitely convinced that it would be undesirable to “honor

Shim with an interview on this subject." He related that he

has ascertained that BARRAGAN is completely unscrupulous,

an opportunist and capable of extortion and blackmail in his f
journalistic pursuits. He added that if BARRAGAN had been

in possession of any information of value, he undoubtedly

would have sought out United States or Mexican authorities

in order to impart that information. He expressed the personal
opinion and conviction that BARRAGAN had sought an interview G
with Chief Justice WARREN or members of @the Warren, Commission Y )
