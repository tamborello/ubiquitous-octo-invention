4, ATTACKS AGAINST: BUREAU “pLacé . 1952) ;

: Although Agent Papich did not begin handling Liaison
“with CIA until 1952, it is important to refer to highly signi- .
ficant differences with CIA which culminated in a serious
conflict in the Fall of 1951. Our Legal Attaches in PAACE
and Place reported that CIA representatives were attacking the
Bureau, were endeavoring to place us in an unfavorable light,
were questioning our jurisdiction, and were making disparaging
remarks concerning the Bureau. Some of this was summed up by
characterizing it as covert ‘hostility within CIA, stemming
largely from disgruntled former employees of the FBI.

In October, 1951, General Walter bedafl Smith, then
Director of CIA, asked to meet with the Director and other
Bureau representatives for the purpose of ‘discussing the
existing differences. General Smith denied that there was any
covert hoetility scainst the Bureau and maintained that there
was a genéral feeling of respect for us. He admitted that
there had been isolated instances of friction fur which CIA.
must accept its share of responsibility. — a

It is my recollection that the Director and other
_ Bureau officials did meet with General Smith, at which time
guidelines were set forth for maintaining future relations

between the two agencies. I was not able to find a memorandum
of record covering this meeting.

2. PROSELYTING OF BUREAU PERSONNEL BY CIA , °

The Agent clearly recalls that early in the 1950's

We encountered difficulties with CIA because the Agency allegedly
was recruiting Bureau-employed personnel. We vigorously pro-
tested,and subsequently the Agency advised that it would follow
& policy of not having any contact with a Bureau employee until
the individual had been separated from the Bureau for a period

of at least thirty days. The Agent could not locate the backe
ground of this matter in the files reviewed by him. It is pos-
sible that the pertinent information lies in the personnel file
of some former Bureau Agent.
