any. future Federal or State proceedings, stated that he was i
with PAT TIANI, described by the informant as a used car :
salesman on the afternoon of November 25, 1957, when TIANT
met MIKE GENOVESE and they’ entered the Genovese Cocktail —
Lounge together. He said he met TIANI two hours later and
was told that GENOVESE had been discussing the meeting at
Apalachin, N. Y. According to TIANI, GENOVESE remarked that
"They'll never find out what went on in New York and :

when they do no one will ever believe it." The informant
explained that according to TIANI, GENOVESE said the meeting
in New York took’place in order to plan legitimate enterprises
in which the group might make an investment ad it was agreed :
that motels should be built throughout the country and be /
operated legitimately. The informant said that according

to TIANI, GENOVESE'said the local representatives were to

begin the construction of a motel in their territory and if they
encountered any financial trouble the group meeting at

Apalachin would be called upon for assistance. “

friendly and LA ROCCA invited him to share equally in the

ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company which later

set up offices at 5746 Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh. (Acs }
recalled that LA ROCCA was completely bankrupt at that time

because of numbers setbacks but managed to raise enough money

to put up his share, FraActs Gsaid he personally travelled to

Chicago to arrange for the purchase of machines to he distributed

by this company and. had a verbal agreement with ART ROONEY who
allowed him to place these machines throughout the st Liberty, be
Homewood and Garfield sections of Pittsburgh where ROONEY was <a,
not operating. According torr act > (4) ROONEY, who is the present ph “4
owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, professional football club, a

was the only man who could get paste reels before LA ROCCA
tried, and controlled the entire Pittsburgh vicinity in this
regard, Jk Acts (said that the government placed a $100 tax
stamp on each machine and the City of Pittsburgh put a $50 tax

stamp on each machine. He said that other owners of the pA
company, in addition to himself and LA ROCCA, were FRANK AMATO,

before Allegheny County authorities raided establishments

He recalled that although each of the six aforementioned
individuals owned an equal share in the company, SAM MANNARIN®
and LA ROCCA seemed to run everything and held meetings at
which important subjects were discussed in Italian, which he
did not understand. He advised that he realized that LA ROCCA
was only using him for his proven protection methods andi ‘ct 6 4)
did not mind as long as he got his cut of the profits. He
_recalled that during 1946 or 1947, MIKE GENOVESE came on the
scene, He stated that this individual had been a pickup man
for LA ROCCA in the East Liberty-Homeyood section of Pittsburgh
and was a tough kid who, according tovmacts 4) "was almost begging ’
to go to jail." He said LA ROCCA turned GENOVESE over to him {

for future plans. He recalled that FRANK/#VALENTI, wno 2 A:
was present, at the Apalachin conference of hoodlums, (pe
and. ANTONI IPEPI, a Pittsburgh hoodlum,. visited the

offices of the Coin Machine Distributing Company regularly

and always took orders from MANNARINO and LA ROCCA. He

said RIPEPI was a moreimportant racket.man than VALENTI

but that LA ROCCA seemed to be the key man in the Pittsburgh
area. He.said he would place LA ROCCA and MANNARINO as

the two men controlling. the rackets in Western Pennsylvania
and he sees MIKE.GENOVESE:as the jogical successor to

the top position. .

PG T-1, who has expresséd an unwillingness to appear before
any future Federal or State proceedings, advised that in
about 1947 Pittsburgh labor leader NICHOLAS])}STIRONE visitea Pu
the offices of the Coin Machine Distributing Company and
asked SAMUEL MANNARINO to get some “gorillas" to handle some
“men who were giving STIRONE labor trouble on a highwayy
being built in the Monroeville, Pa., vicinity and more
‘specifically to give the dissenters a "going over" at the

. same time. they were upsetting their. equipment. According to

% ‘the informant, this: job was carried out by SAMUEL MANNARINO
for STIRONE buttMANNARINO became incensed when he learned :
nis "gorillas" had hurt some older Italian.men. The informant
said that’MANNARINO had been under the impression that the
men who had defied STIRONE were young punks.

| The aforementioned informant advised that the term "Mafia"
| was never used when he was closely associated with LA ROCCA,
AMATO and the MANNARINO brothers. He said that everyone
knew these individuals during the late 1930s and early 1940s
as "blackhanders" and that this term was bandied about without
fear at the offices of the Coin Machine Distributing Company
‘\ when LA.ROCCA held sway. He said that the aforementioned
‘\ individuals hired groups .of "toughs" to do their work for
in them and that these hoodlums of low intelligence and poor
im Italian background carried-no knives or guns. He said that

he recalls that they were armed with cue sticks which they
had ostensibly stolen from poolrooms throughout the Pittsburgh
area and which had been sawed off to 12-15-inch lengths.

oy He explained that the heavy..end of the cue stock was used
\ as the business end and that a hole was bored into the

\O bottom and lead used as a further weight. He said that after
