! Hotel.

j Nostra Chief SALVATORE J. PIERI arrived in Miami abord United Airlines

Florida, from the airport to the Dean Martin Restaurant, Miami Beach, where
a la Cosa Nostra meeting was held that evening. ;

leaving Miami International Airport, they ascertained that they were being
taijed by several cars. These cars followed then to various side streets
1 and upon arrival at the Dean Martin's Restaurant, parked in the street -
across from the meeting place.

: informant said that the immer meeting itself was held between thirteen

: and fourteen individuals in a room located on the righthand side of the

\ bar as one walks into the restaurant. This meeting involved various

| discussions including:

(1) There is concern among the Miami La Cosa Nostra Faction

e that they are generally disorganized, which disorganization

: could prove disadvantageous in light of the growth of La
Cosa Nostra activities in the area. It is felt that in light
of this growth, without proper organization, fights over lines
of demarcation could arise. “ y

(2) There is concern in regard to large amounts of money being

placed through appropriate fronts by ANGELO BRUNO family from
Philadelphia. The general feeling was that in light of these
large investments, comprised mainly of large commercial lines,
that BRUNO is "coming on strong" in Miami and is obviously
attempting to greatly expand his influence.
