MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. McGeorge Bundy

SUBJECT: Yuri Ivanovich NOSENKO

1. This memorandum refers to the State Department
release of 10 February on subject case and provides addi-
tional background as well as information on his current
status.

2. As a KGB staff officer, NOSENKO is regularly
assigned to the Counterintelligence Directorate of the
KGB in Moscow but was included in the Soviet delegation
to the Disarmament Conference as part of a cover arrange-
ment which permitted him to carry out intelligence and
security functions in Geneva on behalf of the KGB.

3. NOSENKO also attended various sessions of the
Disarmament Conference held in Geneva in 1962, During
the course of these sessions NOSENKO sought contact with
officials of the U. S. Government, informed these officials
that he was affiliated with the Soviet State Security ap-
paratus and volunteered to aid the U. S. Government in
detecting Soviet subversive activity directed against the
U. S. Government. During the course of his contact with
U. S. authorities NOSENKO stated that his cooperation with
the U. S. Government originated with his distaste and hatred
for the Soviet regime in general, with his desire to obtain
revenge for the unjust death of his father, a senior official
in the Soviet shipbuilding industry, and with the general
admiration of the Americans with whom he had come in contact
within the Soviet Union.

4. In late January 1964, NOSENKO arrived in Geneva,
again masquerading as a member of the Soviet delegation
to the Disarmament Conference. Subject secretly notified
his CIA contacts in the United States concerning his pres-
ence in Geneva and arranged to meet with these contacts.
During a series of meetings NOSENKO provided information
including documents concerning Soviet State Security acti-
vities within the USSR and abroad and a detailed account
of the KGB operation against.U. S. Professor Barghoorn
which NOSENKO said he. had personally supervised at the
direction of SEMICHASTNIY, the Chairman of the Committee
for State Security (KGB).

5. During these most recent meetings NOSENKO announced
his desire to leave the USSR permanently and seek his future
in the West. He claimed his new work in the KGB (First
Deputy Chief of that department charged with the surveillance
and recruitment of American visitors to the USSR) was ex-
panding and that he would not be able to visit the West
with any frequency. Accordingly, he prepared a request for
political asylum in the United States. ie was taken to
Frankfurt, Germany where he is currently undergoing interro-
gation. Plans are now being made to remove him to the U. S.

6. It should be noted that CIA contact with Subject
has not been extensive and that we will require additional
thorough interrogation to establish Subject's bona fides.
It should also be noted that NOSENKO's duties were not con-
cerned with substantive aspects of the Disarmament Conference,
and he therefore is not expected to be able to shed much, if
any, light on that area of our interest.

7. The possibility that NOSENKO's defection was de-
signed to wreck the conference was most carefully considered.
The decision to accept him was taken on the conviction that
the Soviets would not have chosen such a vulnerable agent
(staff officer of the KGB) for this kind of move.
