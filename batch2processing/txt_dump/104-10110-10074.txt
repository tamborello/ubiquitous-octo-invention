Subject was head of the New Orleans Cuban Revolutionary

Council. A "States-Item" article for 21 July 1962 reported that
Gerald P. HEMMING, aka Jerry PATRICK, “showed up in New Orleans
apparently at the invitation of local Cuban Revolutionary Council
leaders and other Cubans who wanted to take direct action against

: CASTRO." The article related how "PATRICK" made regular trips in and

i out of New Orleans and was supplied with machine guns, explosives and

i other military supplies. HEMMING, aka PATRICK, agreed to set up a

| training base at Lake Ponchartrain but the Miami CRC headquarters

| nixed this base for undisclosed reasons in July 1962, according to
