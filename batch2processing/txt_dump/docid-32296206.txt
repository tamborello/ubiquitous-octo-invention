Activity at the various gambling establishments in New
Kensington, Pa., continues unusually Siow as it has since

the defeat of Mayor RAYMOND GANDLOCK in the primary elections
of §/16/31. Many of GABRIEL MANNARINO's “small fry"
employees are complaining because in general their Incomes
are based on commissions from the volume of gambling receipts.
Bven the "after hours" drinking establishments are doing

very little business.

graduate fran New Kensington High School on 6/7/61. It is
expected that she will receive many handsome gifts, includ-
