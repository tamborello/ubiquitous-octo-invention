MM 105-1601 . “SECREE—

It is noted that CIA requested the State Depart-
ment not to disseminate the above information outside of
their office, without prior approval from CIA; therefore,
this information is being placed in the Administrative
Section of this report, inasmuch as the information can
not be disseminated.

It is noted that on June 2, 1961, MM 726-S
informed that subject, in addition to stating that he had
transmitted messages on behalf of the FRD, had said that
everything he sent went to CIA before being transmitted,
and that all information which came back from Cuba went
to the FRD and also to CIA.. Subject told informant that
if he goes to trial, he will implicate CIA as being behind
his radio operation.

This information has been furnished to Mr. RAY
DUBOIS, CIA, Miami. {DUBOIS said he had received similar

reports, and that for that reason, his headquarters, on

May 12, 1961, requested that efforts be made to have the |
charges dropped at Miami against subject. DUBOIS said
such action was requested, inasmuch as the general feeling
was that if subject were prosecuted, it could result in
embarrassment to CIA. iff u)

- On May 3, 1961, ROBERT W. RUST, Assistant United
‘States Attorney, Miami, Florida, who is handling the pro-
secution of subject, directed a letter to HAROLD SHAPIRO,
Chief, Administrative Regulations Section, Criminal
Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D. C., en-
closing copies of the complaint filed against the subject.
RUST said in his letter that he was not proceeding further
with the prosecution, until such time as he received
instructions from the interested agencies, or Mr. SHAPIRO's
office. RUST added that his office had not been advised
as yet as to the results of the cryptographic analysis t
of the seized code books and coded messages, and that he
had received no information whatsoever concerning this
matter. 2.
