MANOLO RAY RIVERO File review, FBI, 3/17/78

File #65 - 76238

1. First telex dated June 1, 1977 to Director from San Juan
Marked "Secret" :
Subject: Manuel Ray - Espinoage - Cuba

On May 23, 1977, SOURCE advised that a known Cuban intelligence
agent known as "CARLOS" stated that when 799° °° ‘visited
Puerto Rico in January 1977, she was told by Manuel Ray that he
was interested in meeting with CUIS (Cuban Intelligence). RAY
said he would send her a letter in Cuba for contact. "CARLOS"
made it appear that CUIS did not want any connection between
and RAY. CUIS wants no third party involvement.
Source says RAY's meeting with CUIS would be in the near future.

To date, RAY has not presented his permit to re-enter the United
States for extension or reissue nor has any information been
received as a result of the Fl stop placed with INS. Therefore,
any foreign travel on RAY's part is not known. Subject has been
observed at home and attempts being made to develop a neighborhood
type source that can advise on his travel. CUIS could possibly
contact RAY in the U.S. but that is not their usual method of
operation.

Bureau requested to forward this information to Legats Mexico
City, Caracas and CIA. (Penciled note here "Not necessary
since covered in leads to Legats Mexico and Caracas and CIA
S.J. tel dd 5/12/77).

that Cuban government wanted to help him get his business visa
again in Jamacia. After the meeting with‘ ** 7" __, «RAY

stated he would have to think about the Cuban offer.

Review of San Juan indices reflects RAY's involvement in anti-
Castro activities in Puerto Rico and Miami -- was last affiliated
with PARTIDO REVOLUCIONARIO del PUEBLO (PRP). File reflects

RAY as Pro-Castro. RAY denied this in FBI interview on 8/24/74.

into Cuba and to overthrow CASTRO was through negotiations with
CASTRO.

Manuel Ray review, 3/17/78 SOMMITTEE SENSITIVE

has been instructed to follow RAY's activities as
closely as possible, consistent with appropriate security. .
San Juan feels that the investigation in this matter should, for
the present, be extremely discreet, slow and low key. FCI
case progressing well, is of known quantity and has excellent
potential in both pro and anti-Castro areas. Nothing should be
done to jeopardize the — : operation. If RAY finds out
FBI interested in him, he will know his contact with CUIS has
been blown and as a result the source of information could be
traced back to : thereby ending the
usefulness-.to the Bureau.

Since FBI has not conducted an investigation on RAY for some time,
San Juan feels that investigative technique now should be limited
to contacts with established sources and record and agency checks
that would not cause suspicion. Feels that survellances,
neighborhood sources, interview of RAY, mail cover, etc, would
arouse suspicion and compromise —— - . S.Juan feels if
RAY. cooperating with CUIS it will be a long going association
allowing him to become more deeply involved.

Also, it is possible information on RAY was passed to : as
a test of the . : reliability. RAY may already have
been cooperating. with CUIS and therefore. expected.to report FBI
interest in him, thereby implicating : . The — FCI

case which is too valuable an operation to loose, offers more
potential than RAY. Even if he were eventually turned against
cutis, : ; is in a better position than RAY to infiltrate
CORU for reasons set forth in their respective investigative

~ files, and thereby enhance his work with CUIS.

San Juan feels that if for some reason the OCELOT case not
successful, or start to sour, more overt techniques could be
implemented in the Ray - aka Espionage Cuba, case.

The longer RAY goes without detection the harder it will be for
him to pinpoint source of information should he detect FBI
interest in him.

4. Teletype July 27, 1977 to San Juan from Director indicates a
request is pending with CIA concerning RAY's foreign travel and
also attempting to verify RAY's contacts with Jamacian authorities.

Manuel Ray review, 3/17/78

In a December 5, 1975 (?) FBI interview, RAY said he hada
contact in Mexico that provided him with information from
Cuba -- identified as JOSE MARMOL DIAZ, Doctor of Commercial
Sciences, Roma IS, Dept. 201, Conia Juez, Mexico City. RAY
said MARMOL may have G-2 connections and feeding false
information to him.

On May 18, 1977,.RAY's INS file reviewed in San- Juan. (1 1/2
page deletion, File #A7-056-497).  ------ Also, if the CIA can
with due caution determine if visa work permit or similar
document was revoked and then reissued by Jamacian authorities.

Bureau is requested to contact their cources in Cuban exile

community to get information on RAY's current activities. Miami asked
to review pertinent files on RAY and forward information to San

Juan.

San Juan will contact its cources and conduct an appropriate
investigation to determine subject's current activities and
contacts. San Juan wishes to eventually interview RAY with goal
of recruiting him as an Operation Asset directed against CUIS.

Interview being held in abeyance pending further investigation.
Interview premature now as not enough information available to
conduct a thorough and probing interview nor is there enough
material to confront subject with.

San Juan feels that this case offers excellent potential for a
double agent operation targeted against CUIS.

San Juan aware careful planning necessary to protect — and
its valuable source.

3. July 6, 1977, San Juan to Director. Secret. Ref. San Juan
teletype to Director June 1, 1977.
San Juan has evaluated this matter and makes following observations.

The initial allegation concerning RAY was made by who
- learned of CUIS interest in RAY from CUIS itself, and from
. - %In.addition, : reported that RAY

consented to meet with CUIS. Apart from CUIS, there are no

other individuals known to be aware of CUIS interest in RAY other
than the individuals referred to above. Accordingly, the allegation
concerning RAY is Singular in nature and therefore an investigation
of RAY be extremely discreet. reported on 6/2/77 RAY
indicated interest in participation in CORU. This indicated RAY
acting under direction of CUIS as he has not been active in anti-
Castro movement in last two years.
