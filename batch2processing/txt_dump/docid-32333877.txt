‘ FRANK, an oil worker from Houston, wanted to know the
role of the Negro in the CP,- STANFORD informed the, committee
that at the present there were no. Negroes in the cP, There”

were some who read "political Affairs” and "The: Worker." “On:
-a recent, survey that he made STANFORD said he found out_ that a

good number of Negroes read "New Horizons," "Freedom Ways"

and the’ "National Guardian." . STANFORD did: not say whether’ ‘the |

sufvey was made in San Antonio or an Houston, © There: had‘ been
other requests, he assumed them from other sources asking: ‘for
an organizer from the national office. (Previous ‘to this, :
FRANK Had stressed the need for an importation ‘from the’

‘national office. The imports job he added would pe to ‘recruit

Negroes for membership ‘in the CP, Someone was needéd who:

could deviate his or her. time to that project. He could not do
it; he didn’t have the time. In fact he'dube suspicious if-

he lingered too long talking to.a Negro at his job... ‘FRANK said
he felt SMITH would meet with CP personnel if he was gor etly
approached, FRANK admitted that SMITH was scared. KX Bey u) ,

AUGUSTIN ESTRADA said he: could spend. a week end
talking to some of the folks he knew, JOE LANDIN said he agreed
with FRANK, someone was needed full time to do the job, BILL.
LOWERY and: JOHN STANFORD figured the best thing to do was for

\-them to do that job themselves. . STANFORD explained. that he

based the deductign on the fact that there. was no. contact. with —
the national office, The last contact had been. made a year

ago. Lipgw 4

Informant further determined that FRANK told. JOHN:
STANFORD that he suspected a Negro of being a spy..° The’ man’
had. been asking questions about him and had just happened to
be on the same train with "POLLY" when she passed by there

(sometime ago). This man has a railroad card which entitles RG

him to free rides. LEW
