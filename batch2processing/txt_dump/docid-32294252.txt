3. When JAMES GILLECE, Security Chief of the
Fontainebleau Hotel was contacted he stated the only
Chicago former police officer who has worked for him
during the past few years is LUTRELL "ED" WHITE, who
resides at 1800 Northeast Bayshore Drive, Miami, Florida,
telephone FR 4-2450. WHITE worked as a security man at the
Fontainebleau Hotel from 12/22/62 to early 8/63. WHITE
should be interviewed to determine if he recalls ALDERISIO
being at the hotel during the period of his employment °
and even though this employment was after the meeting in
question he might know of the alias ALDERISIO uses and might
have some suggestions on how ALDERISIO's registration might be
verified for the pertinent period.

4. Will write both the Minneapolis and Atlanta
Offices to determine exactly how the airline tickets for
Northwest Airlines as well as Delta Airlines are maintained
since ultimately an exhaustive examination of airline tickets
will have to be made in an attempt to prove the interstate
transportation of ALDERISIO. : -

ADMINISTRATIVE

The Bureau has previously instructed that this
case be given top priority. There is every indication that
Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY is personally interested in
this case and therefore, all leads should be expeditiously ©

On 8/29/63, MM 830-C was contacted by SA ROBERT
F. FETZNER and the informant made inquiry, through his sources
at the Fontainebleau Hotel, Miami Beach, in an effort to
locate a registration card on ALDERISIO for the period
of about May or June, 1962, but the informant was not able to

INQUIRY AT AIRLINES She Low 2144)
At Miami, Florida

On August 5, 1963, SA THOMAS E. O'CONNOR contacted
CHARLES POWERS, Supervisor of Passenger Statistics, Eastern
Airlines, Miami, Florida. POWERS said he believes Eastern cd
Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Delta Airlines are the vee
only carriers that have direct flights between Miami and
Chicago, Illinois. He stated Eastern Airlines and Delta
Airlines each have six flights daily and Northwest has
three flights daily. POWERS estimated that each of the =
Eastern Airlines flights carries an average of 100 passengers ,
and although the airplanes have a capacity of 135 passengers
they are rarely filled and he would estimate that they transport i
600 passengers daily from Chicago to Miami. He stated his
airline's passenger tickets are preserved for two years after !
they are used and they are filed by flight number and the date
of the flight. He pointed out because of certain accounting
procedures all of the airline's tickets for a particular ° '
flight would not be in one place and therefore, he would estimate i
that it would. take one man one day te check one day's Eastern
Airlines flights between Chicago and Miami.
