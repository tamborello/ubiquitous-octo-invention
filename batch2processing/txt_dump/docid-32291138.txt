(FNU) NOVIA 92-1377 , 5

This person may be identical with PASQUALE NOVIA i
who was born in Italy on 1/1/84. In 1953, he resided at
513 South 14th St., Newark, N.J. In 1962 he was reported to
be a member of the Essex County Hunting and Fishing Club,
Newark, This organization, a gathering place for elderly
Italians, is operated by CARMINE BATTAGLIA who is reliably re-
ported to be a Cosa Nost?a member. Sincé NOVIA is 80 years
old and is not known to be éigaged in ¢riminal activities,
no additional investigation concerning him is contemplated.
