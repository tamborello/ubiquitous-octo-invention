Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
Re: Felix "Milwaukee Phil" Alderisio

Glickman states that Terrell is not acquainted with
ranking hoodlums in Chicago or New York and is completely unaware
of connections of the New York and Chicago underworld in his
affairs. Furthermore, Glickman claims to have been threatened
by Alderisio to influence Terrell to sign with Glaser for a fight
in Madison Square Garden. However, Glickman.and Terrell have a
private understanding that Terrell will later back out of the
contract and refuse to fight for the flat sum of $150,000 since
Clay obviously will be receiving millions in theater, filn,
television rights and from the live gate. :

OBSERVATIONS:

The interest of Chicago and New York hoodlums in
fighter Terrell is similar to their previous interest and control
over heavyweight Charles "Sonny" Liston. Glickman apparently is
being muscled out of any control he may have over Terrell by the
Chicago hoodlum group. Obviously, contacts with him must be
handled in a.most circumspect manner.

ACTION:

This matter is being closely followed and Chicago is
conducting inquiries attempting to establish a violation of
the Interstate Transportation in Aid of Racketeering - Extortion |
statute in connection with Alderisio's threats against Glickman. i
