impossible to take up the subject of the money and therefore did not do so,
reporting that he believes a payment will not now be necessary. The Station
hasn*t noticed any unusual references to the murder of ANMPHODARCH-1 in the
local press since lifting of the censorship. However, about 3 April
AMPHODARCH-1°s niece again visited the Embassy and talked te the Citizen~
ship Officer, reopening the case of AYPHODARCH-1 and asking whether some~.

could not be done by the Embassy regarding his murder, when the
Citizenship Officer, after checking the files, told her that as AMPHODARCH1
was not a citizen and therefore he could do nothing about the matter, the
niece left the Embassy obviously annoyed and disappointed. No further visits
to the Pmbassy by AVPHODARCH-1°s farily have come to the attention of the -
Station, and no contact has been made with that family. Efforts are being
mede, with the assistance of the local ODENVY, to identify the killer or
killers of this agent, for the record.

3. On 9 April 1957, the cut-out AMANTELOPE contacted AMFdODARCH-3
and is now in regular weekly touch with that agent. In addition to a certain
amount of reporting upon student and university events, A!PHODARCH-3’s .
principal current task is maintaining contact with AYPHODARCH-6 with a view
to arranging a personal meeting between ANANTELOPE and ANPHODARCH-6 to enable
the Station to check progress of this operation and strengthen our relation=
ship with the latter, Progress in this effort will be reported,

1, Following Subject’s arrival in Habana on 19 March 1957, he first
contacted AVPHODARCH-3 (on 20 March) and set up fresh contact arrangements
between AMPHODARCH-3 and cut-out AMANTELOPE to be initiated following
VAIVADA’s departure for PBPRIVE. On 21 March, VAIVADA contacted the mother

Presidential Palace of 13 March. At a Personal meeting held in a secure
location with AMPHODARCH-10’s mother on that day, the latter asked help in
getting AVFHODARCH-10 into PEPRIEE, After consulting with the Station,
VAIVADA told the mother that this would be imprdtical as her son would have
to personally appear in the Consulate to obtain a visa; she was advised to

tell AKPHODARCH-10 to go into exile in Panama, and from there to go to Costa | :
..Rica 4f he so desired under the conditions set out in FKH-A- 3507, dated .

4 April 1957, already forwarded to San Jose and to the chief, WHD. At the
same time, VAIVADA forwarded the sum of $100 to AVPHODARCH-10 through his
mother, The help afforded AMPHODARCH~10 at this meeting was greatly
appreciated, the agent’s mother affirming to VAIVADA before their parting
that she felt certain the agent would cooperate with us at any time, Arrange~
ments were made for the Station to contact the mother independently at any
time this appears necessary,

2, %In the evening of 21 Varch, after having telephoned te arrange a
visit, VAIVADA met with the sister and niece of AMPHODARCH-1, ‘The Station had
determined that VAIVADA should, if possible, broach the problem of payment of
the $1000 authorized at that time, describing it as being back salery dus”
AMPHODARCE-1, rather than presenting it as a pay-off since the amount, by
local standards and that of an insurance policy premium, was small, VAIVADA
was well-received by the family and as a result of the visit believes there is
nO possibility that the family is interested in embarrassing him, However,
the whole atmosphere and tone of the visit was such that VAIVADA found it
