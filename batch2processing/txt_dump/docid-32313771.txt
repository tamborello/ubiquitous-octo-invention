Previous investigation has reflected that
ROLANDO ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS, former Cuban Senator,
presently residing in New York City, allegedly had sent
a group of Cuban exiles from the New York area to Miami,
for the purpose of participating in an invasion of Haiti,
and that, some of these men had reportedly gone down to
the Florida. Keys to a camp for training.

Close friends and relatives of MASFERRER, when
interviewed, denied any knowledge of these allegations
and claimed that MASFERRER had not. been in the Miami area,
despite reports to the contrary.

It is to be noted that during the BATISTA regime,
while serving as Senator from Oriente Province, MASFERRER
was the head of a so-called "goon squad" commonly known as
"The Tigers." MASFERRER acquired a reputation of being
ruthless, but was at the same time an enemy of FIDEL
CASTRO. He is still regarded with considerable fear by
many Cubans, and at the same time he has the staunch
support of his followers.

_ He has been excluded from the Miami area and
restricted to the New York area by the Immigration and

mately 16 Cubans dressed in Army fatigues, who claimed to
be members of the 2506th Brigade, recently discharged from
the U.S. Army. The group claimed they were on No Name Key
to take photographs of army maneuvers for propaganda
purposes and to raise funds. They claimed to have the
permission of the owner to occupy the premises and would

. remain on the key for 2 or 3 days. A search by the Cus-

toms agents did not reflect any concealed weapons.

planes pass in the vicinity of No Name Key about twice a
