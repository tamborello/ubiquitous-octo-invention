a 33. The question of "reactivation" of the Roselli operation in

November 1961. In November of 1961, Richard Bissell asked me
to take over the Roselli contact. Richard Bissell's testimony,
as represented to me by Mr. Baron, that Roselli was viewed as
an "inactive contact” at that time is exactly contrary to my
recollection. I recall that Bissell simply asked me to take
over the Sheffield Edwards operation. This was not a revival
of anything that had been terminated or put on ice. The
operation had never stopped. There was no indication in any
of my talks with Richard Bissell that the Roselli operation
was dormant. But in fairness to Bissell, I don't know that he
ever said precisely that it was an ongoing operation. The
impression I received from Bissell, however, was that it was
ae , indeed an ongoing operation. There was nothing said to the
contrary. My subsequent talks with Edwards, O'Connell, and
Roselli indicated that the operation was active. But I do not
know how close Bissell was to the operation and exactly what
he knew about it. It may have been his impression that the
operation was inactive. Whatever language Bissell used with
me, it was clear to me that the operation was ongoing and that
I was to do whatever I could with it. It was also clear from
my first conversation with Roselli that the operation had never
been called off. Jim O'Connell also indicated to me that he
was still in contact with Roselli. Shortly after my discussion
with Bissell of my takeover of the Roselli contact, I discussed

@ the Roselli operation with Edwards. The only reason for the

HY 50955 Docld:32203892 Page 9
<> _ hiatus in activity in the Roselli operation between November
of 1961 and my meeting with Roselli in New York in April of 1962
was the intensity of my other responsibilities at the CIA.
During this period, I had to set up Task Force W, including
recruiting its members. I also had to continue the ongoing
Cuban operations and write frequent memos to Lansdale and
Robert Kennedy on these subjects, When I was requested to take
over the Roselli operation, I assessed it and determined that
the operation should be terminated because it had little chance
of success. But because of the tremendous repercussion potential,
I delayed the termination. I subsequently terminated the Roselli
operation as soon as feasible after the missile crisis in
October of 1962. It would have been terminated earlier except
« that during the crisis I could not cut off any potential asset.
Had I been given the original assignment of removing Castro,

this is not the way I would have done it,

34. Authorization through Bissell. At no time did I or anyone else
connected with the Castro assassination operation (Helms, Edwards,
O'Connell and Roselli) ever have the slightest doubt that this
was fully authorized. But ny sense of the existence of this
authorization came solely from my conversations with Richard

Bissell. I had no other direct information about the source

of authorization for the operation. -

@ 30. This memorandum of January 11, 1960 does not reflect any first-

 

hand knowledge on my part of the nature of mission

in the Congo.

WLIROGUE

31. Mr. Baron showed me the cable of December 17, 1960 from
Leopoldville to CIA headquarters concerning an approach by
WIROGUE to QJWIN for the purpose of recruiting QJWIN for "an
execution squad." I do have a vague recollection that QJWIN
was approached in the Congo in connection with a "direct
action" operation. But it is my impression that this was an
incident involving free-wheeling by an agent, rather than an
assassination mission.

@ ZRRIFLE/ROSELLI OPERATION

32. Project ZRRIFLE was used for funding the Roselli operation.
Project ZRRIFLE, which began as the development of an Executive
Action capability, was later used for the accounting for the
Roselli operation. This was for the purpose of the convenience
of vouchering whatever expenses were involved and to ensure
security. This enabled me to keep the general Task Force W

operations separate from the Roselli operation.

28. After reviewing the Memorandum for the Finance Division from

“William K, Harvey, Chief, (REDivisiou7p" dated January 11, 1960

that this memorandum was written for my signature by

of January 11, 1960: “In order to avoid any misunderstanding,
it should be noted that QJWIN was sent on this trip for a
specific highly sensitive operational purpose which has been

completed." I do not know what "completed" would have meant,

QIWIN's instructions for asset spotting did not change at all

after Project ZRRIFLE was established as far as I mow.[ |

 

[}continued to be the intermediary between myself and
QIWIN. I never met OJWIN.

QJWIN was not permitted to make a single recruitment as far

as I know.

The lengthy handwritten notes which appear in the QJWIN/ZRRIFLE
file (a xeroxed version of a spiral notebook) were probably
written byl sidfin the course of debriefing QJWIN

on his asset spotting. This is a deduction on my part based
upon the handwriting and the terminology used in these notes.
If there was any CIA mission to kidnap Lumumba from UN custody
and turn him over to Mobutu, I did not know of it. I do not
think anyone would be naive enough to think that if Lumumba
were turned over to Mobutu, he would live through it.

As far as I know, QJWIN was entirely run bv[ sie this
point. In other words, I do not know of any independent lines
of responsibility or reporting that QJWIN had to other people

in the CIA station in the Congo 6f..to anyorié on Staff B.

é 19. As far as I knew, neither, —_—i|nor QJVIN ever had an assassi-

nation mission.

20. If QJWIN were to be used on an assassination mission, it would
have been cleared with me. I was never informed that he was
to be used for such a mission. Nor did I ever discuss any such
mission with him as far as I know.

21. Iwas kept informed of the arrangements for QJWIN's trip to
the Congo and, subsequently, of his presence in the Congo. I
do not know specifically what QJWIN did in the Congo. I do
not think that I ever had such knowledge.

22. I was shown a CIA cable to Director fronf | IN 36814,
dated November 2, 1960 regarding QJWIN's mission to the Congo
which reads, in the first paragraph: "He accepted offer.

@ Proceed Leopoldville. Precise mission not conveyed to him,
He only informed that mission might involve large element of
personal cisk."|_————| probably wrote this cable.
This cable does not indicate any particular kind of operation,
like an assassination mission, because anyone going to the
Congo at this time would have assumed a great risk if they

were undertaking any kind of operation against Lumumba.

LUMUMBA'S ACTUAL DEATH

1. I do not know of any connection between the CIA and Lumumba's
actual death.

LUMUMBA PLOTS

2, I never heard of poison being sent from the CIA to the Congo
station, nor did I ever hear of any CIA assassination mission

in the Congo. I am almost sure that never told me

@ that he had learned that there were poisons in the Congo.

| YOTWIN CONGO MISSION

3. The only mention of assassinating Lumumba that I recall is

R's conversation with me.
4. B only told me that he had agreed to go to the

Congo to discredit Lumumba and that he had refused to undertake

 

 

 

 

 

an assassination mission which Richard Bissell attempted to
give him.

5. I did not debrief {—] when he returned from the Congo.
So I did not learn from him what the nature of his mission was.

6. I's activities in the Congo were not a Staff D opera-

 

tion. Despite the fact that the memo of January 11, 1960
e mentions that "QJWIN was being used for FI/D purposes," QJWIN's

mission in the Congo was not a Staff D operation. Rather, it

 

was an African Division operation. I merely loaned

© to the African Division. In turn, QJWIN was loaned by my
deputy, jeo| for his activities in the
Congo.

7. In fact, it is possible thay, sd might not know
exactly what QJWIN did in the Congo because[ may simply

have arranged for WIN to be placed under the supervision of

( and sent to the Congo.

8. The use of the phrase "FI/D purposes" in the memo of January 11,

 

1960 was purely an administrative device to secure funding for
QJWIN and allow for accounting out of Staff D funds. I am

almost 100% sure that there was no actual FI/D assignment.

9. It is possible that| _—isfmay have used QJWIN to aid in a

Bip cers sSy in the Congo. _ |

 

    
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

il the primary purpose

off i's trip was to undertake an operation against

Lumumba.

 

10. The specific nature of QJWIN's assignment in the Congo was

  
 

 

 

 

probably worked out between
