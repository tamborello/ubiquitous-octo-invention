(HSCA) - 1 May 1978

1. (S) Onl May 1978, a meeting was held with HSCA representatives
and FBI representatives. Present from the HSCA were: G. Robert Blakey,

Present from the FBI were: Danny Coulson, John Kaul and Jim Freeman.
Also present were Norbert Shepanek, O/SA/DO/O; Patrick Carpentier, of
OLC, and myself.

2. (S) Mr. Blakey called the meeting to discuss Bernardo de Torres,
who is purported to be a potential assassin and who was purported to be in
Dealey Plaza on 23 November 1963. De Torres was scheduled to appear
in executive session before the HSCA on 2 May 1978. Mr. Blakey opened

3. (S) Mr. Blakey then turned his attention to the Agency's response to
his written request for any and all files an de Torres. Mr. Shepanek
pointed out that although there had been an earlier difficulty in locating the
201 on de Torres because of a matronymic/patronymic filing problem, the
HSCA had been given access to all files over a month ago. Mr. Shepanek
acknowledged that third agency documents were inadvertently left in the file
which was provided to HSCA researcher Edwin Lopez. Mr. Lopez took notes
upon these documents and submitted his notes for review at which time the
error became known. The third agency documents, FBI items, were forwarded
to Mr. Coulson on 28 April (Friday) for FBI review and possible release ta
HSCA. Mr. Coulson acknowledged that he had these materials and hoped to
make them available to the Committee at FBI Headquarters immediately
following the meeting.
