When Hestor Sanches wont to see AMLASH-] in Paris recantly, I asked hin

to get IASH’s ecuments on Fidel’s habits, mind, et cetera, LASH said that Fidel
is anything but "crazy" = far to the contrary. LASH could cite no exaxples of

“public peculiarities". For some months prier te LASH's departure for Europe in
mid-November 1964, Fidel had been taking very good care of himself. Ee hes
almost stopped drinking - he now drinks very little indeed. He no longer eate
as he used to - an enormous meal, siaply enormous - ani then perhaps nothing

for 24 hours. He eats a reascnable amount now, anid with more normal frequency.
In addition, he is taking exoreises steadily. He also goes to the beach at

Varadero every weekend, to swim ani skin dive, which he is very foni of.
