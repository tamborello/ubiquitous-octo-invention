M. March 1964. CIA had an operational relationship
with both of the persons mentioned in the report at the time
of the incident. In 1963 and 1964 both persons made proposals
to CIA to assassinate Castro but in each instance they were
told that CIA and the USG did not condone such attempts and
no commitments were made. : :

: '(1).Mario SALABARRIA Aguiar. There is a 201

file on the individual. A POA was requested on subject for

use as an operational support asset in an intelligence
gathering net inside Cuba. We did not deal with him directly
but communicated through third parties. In early March 1964
subject proposed an operation to his contact to assassinate
Castro and asked for pistols, a submachine gun equipped with |
a silencer, several. .30 caliber machine. guns, and some dynamite.
On 9 March 1964 CIA advised his contact to tell subject that
CIA would not help him in this effort. According to CIA

he was one of the principal conspirators involved in the :
plot, together with Mario SALABARRIA Aguiar. Subject requested
CIA assistance for the attempt. CIA immediately informed him
that the USG did not condone such attempts and no commitments
were made to assist him. .

 

N. Mid 1964. Some. of those mentioned in the report
were indeed working for CIA at the time of their arrest. Two
of the subjects reportedly tried to poison Castro but there
is no indication in the files reviewed that the assigned

-mission of the group was to assassinate Castro or that the
poison was provided by CIA. ; ;
