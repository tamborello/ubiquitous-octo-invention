article related that SIDNEY SLATER, .age 38, of 118 West 57th Street,
was continued in $2000.00 bail, in Felony Court, the previous day,

for Grand Jury action. He was charged with Grand Larceny for allegedly
selling pinball machines he did not own, outright. It mentioned that
the complainant was SEYMOUR TEPPER, of Long Beach, Long Island.

January 6, 1959, positively identified a photograph of PHILIP JAMES

concerning, him: ; .

Approximately 18 or 20 months ago PG 7~-4 received a telephone call
from HENRY ABRAHAM, aka "PECKY," operator of a. cocktail lounge
in New.Kensington. ABRAHAM told PG T-4 that he had a deal that
PG T-4 might be interested in and asked him'to come to his place of
business right away. When PG T-4 arrived at "PECKY's" place he was
introduced to two individuals, one a Syrian man age about 40-45, name
unknown, from New Castle or Farrell, Pa., and the other MAINER, although
* MAINER was not introduced to PG T-4 by name. ABRAHAM told PG T-4 :
that the Syrian man was a very good friend of his and had 1800
cartons of stolen cigarettes in a station wagon parked outside that he
would sell for $1.00 a carton. PG T-4 advised that ABRAHAM said that
. he wanted to buy the entire load himself but did not have enough money
5 to swing the deal, and encouraged PG T-4 to-put up half the money so
. they could buy the’load together. ;

3 PG T-4 refused 4nd suggested to ABRAHAM that. they take the cigarettes

that if PG T-4 would not put up. any money he was not in a position
‘to take the-load himself but offered to take them to MANNARINO in his

: own car. . ABRAHAM left with the two individuals and looked up GABRIEL

ae MANNARINO who. presumably bought the entire stolen shipment.
