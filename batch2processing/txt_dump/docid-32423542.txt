Dear Frank:

I was sorry to miss you when you thoughtfully
returned my call yesterday.

Within the past two weeks my name has been .
associated in the press with discussions of the’
assassination of Castro during 1962. I want you
to know that, although I doubt that I have any-
thing to contribute to your investigation, if
your staff or your Committee wishes to question
me about my knowledge of the events of that period,
I will be happy to respond.

With best wishes,
Sincerely,

FHL

Robert S. McNamara

THE WHITE HOUSE

WASHINGTON

June 19, 1975

Dear Mr. Chairman:

This is in response to your letter of yesterday concerning
the meeting we had on a number of matters.

Although I generally agree with your recapitulation of the
points of agreement, I feel obliged to raise one matter
specifically: in order to avoid any misunderstanding of our
position. Your letter states that "The Committee appreci-
ates your intentions to deliver the NSC and other materials
on assassinations by Friday." As I recall, there was no
discussion yesterday with respect to the means and manner

by which the materials relevant to assassination allegations
would be made available to the Select Committee. Your letter
seems to assume that copies of these materials will be
provided to the Committee for its custody. This matter was
not discussed yesterday, and we made no such commitment.

With respect to that matter, I should point out that the
President has expressed his hope that the Congress will
handle the matter of assassination allegations with the
utmost prudence. I am sure you share the same goal. How-
ever, in view of your announced intention to publish an
interim report on these matters, it is our judgment that
additional discussions and assurances are necessary before
we Can responsibly turn over to the Select Committee custody
copies of materials which might ultimately, at your dis-
cretion, be publicly released in a manner so as to substan-
tially affect the ongoing diplomatic and foreign affairs
interests” 6f this country. ’

of course, these discussions should not and will not interfere
with access to these materials by the Select Committee staff.
Beginning tomorrow morning, materials relevant to: assassina-
tion allegations will be available for review in the Situation
Room at the White House. The Situation Room is staffed on a
