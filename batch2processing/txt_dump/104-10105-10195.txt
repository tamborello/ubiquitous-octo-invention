and had sought guidance from the: Agency. In May and June they were
advised to break all ties with WerBell. On 27 June 1974 the FBI was
formally apprised of WerBell's overtures for their collaboration in
the effort to bring Abaco's secession. In September 1974 WerBell
reportedly went to Greece to sell arms to the Greek Government.
Most recently WerBell reportedly appeared before Senator Jackson's

Sub-Committee investigating DEA and had taken the Fifth Amendment

SUBJECT; Mitchell Livingston WerBell III (201-259910)

1. Mitchell Livingston WerBell, who appeared in recent press
reports has for over a period of ten years been claiming to be a
representative of the United States Government and of CIA. The facts

do not support this contention,

2. CIA first learned of WerBell in July of 1959 when he contacted
General Cabel indicating. knowledge of Cuban and Dominican affairs,
MÂ¥: of LA Division was put in contact with WerBell
and considered using | im as an Flasset. A POA was granted on
7 July 1959 for this purpose. By October 1959 it was apparent that he
did not have the access to information as hoped and he apparently looked
upon his association with CIA as a means of furthering his various
business schemes, All contact was then severed.

 

"

3. From that time until the present Mr. WerBell has cropped up
in a number of nefarious activities whereby he inferred he had CIA connections
or support. He was reported to have been involved in arms sales to
Nicaragua and Guatemala, in efforts to gain recognition by certain
South American countries of the Cuban Government in Exile, and in an
abortive scheme to invade the Republic of Haiti-in 1966. He also turned
up in Thailand where he contacted the COS purporting to be a counter-~
insurgency expert. In 1971 the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
queried the Agency re Mr. WerBell, asking if WerBell had a contractual
agreement or association with the Agency, as Werbell was awaiting a hearing
before a Department of Defense Examiner related to his participation in
the aboritve Haiti invasion. The Office of the General Counsel placed the
matter in perspective. Subsequently, he contacted the Agency to request
intercession on his behalf to have his security clearance reinstated which
DoD revoked because of his Haitian caper. He was told this could not be
done. In 1971 he again appeared in Thailand attempting to sell arms. In
1973 he. was under investigation by U.S, Treasury Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms and by the United States Customs Service for activities
relating to possible mercenary activities in Abaco Island, Bahamas. In
this connection WerBell contacted three ex-CIA employees, John P., Muldoon,
Walter J. Mackem and Theodore Roussos ina scheme to involve them in
the activities of an organization called the Friends of Abaco (FOA) which is
advocating the secession of the island from the Commonwealth of Bahamas.
