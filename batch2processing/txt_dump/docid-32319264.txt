Mr. Clazke: IFK ARCH OF IGT

In my note of 11/15/93, I advised you that the House
Governmental Operations Committee (HGOC) was to hold a hearing
yesterday regarding the implementation of the JFK Assassination
Records Collection Act of 1992 (the Act). Further, I indicated
that the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) was
the only Government entity scheduled to provide testimony.

The HGOC hearing was attended by representatives of the
Office of Public and Congressional Affairs (OPCA) and the JFK
Task Force. The hearing was chaired by Representative John
Conyers. Representatives Alfred McCandless and Glenn English
were the only other members of the Committee present.
Representative Louis Stokes, who is not a member of the
Committee, was present at the hearing because of his interest in
the JFK legislation.

Dr. Trudy Huskamp Peterson, Acting Archivist of the
United States, testified first to describe NARA's response to the
Act. Although her full written statement submitted for the
record generally discussed the releases of JFK documents made by
various Government entities, her oral testimony did not. Members
of the Committee did not ask her for information relating to the
responses of the FBI or any other Government entities. °

Five other persons, all of whom have done research
regarding the assassination, testified after Dr. Peterson. At
least three of these individuals expressed concerns regarding the
fact that the FBI had not yet released any JFK documents.
However, members of the Committee did not pursue the issue of the
FBI's response to the Act.

The hearing also produced testimony regarding the fact
that various Government entities other than the FBI, to include
Congress, still have many documents to be released pursuant t
the Act. In addition, Chairman Conyers expressed concern that
the Presidentially appointed Review Board, which is to oversee z
implementation of the Act, is not yet in place.
