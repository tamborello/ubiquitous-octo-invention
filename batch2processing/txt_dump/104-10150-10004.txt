INTRODUCTION

The following summary and analysis is not intended to be

   
  

call inclusive, that is to contain a specific comment on all organi-
zational, operational, personality and case type information furnished
7 by Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO, To attempt to do so would be repetitious
. and confusing. to the reader and would not be of material benefit in the
formation of logical conclusions concerning the rather limited areas of

/ ry primary concern. .

oo This summary. will not contain a detailed psychological
assessment of NOSENKO nor will it contain a recitation of the numerous

. theories which have been promulgated in the past concerning varying

_ --aspects of the NOSENKO case. This summary will be primarily

 

' directed toward the question of whether NOSENKO was or was not
‘dispatched by the KGB, whether his claimed KGB career is relatively
plausible and whether he has since late October 1967 been cooperative in
a Teassessment of the entire case for or against NOSENKO. NOSENKO
has admitted certain lies and exaggerations in the past but claims that —
these were of a personal nature, intended to enhance his own importance
