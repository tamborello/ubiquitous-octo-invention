Enclosed for New York is copy of a CIA intelligence
report dated 12/9/66 classified "“gecret" and concerning the
‘impressions and observations ot (Ca adian gliow travelers
who have visited Communist China. OX)

 

The CIA data relates to a group of (c (Canadian }
"leftists" who visited China in October, 1966, at the invi-
tation of the Chicom Government. Some members of the group
came away opposed to the "Cultural ere een a y

 

During the tour, the group was briefed in Peking
on current conditions in China by T'ANG Ming-chao (0181/2494/ —
3564, CTC), whe was described as Vice Chairman, Chinese
People's Committee on World Peace. Certain members of the
group created somewhat of an uproar by asking awkward
questions and making critical observations against the
"Cultural Revolution." du

 

It is believed that this is the same T' ANG
Ming~chao who is reported to have been closely associated
with Israel Epstein and who is also a contact of subject.
He is also believed to be identical with the individual who
is reported to be head of political intelligence for English
spéaking countries on behalf of the Chicoms. Z

/ (_« Recent reports indicate that Israel Epstein

and his°wife were arrested in China for espionage, Michael

Shapiro was arrested for espionage, Sidney Rittenberg was.
‘- purged from his joh at Hadie Peking and Anna Louise Strong

was condemned by wall posters as "an imperialist agent.

Sue Frank is obviously concerned about these reports,

go much go that she is taking a trip in the near future

to London and possibly Paris in an attempt to determine

the truth or falsity of these reports. NY 404745% has

advised that the above arrests havé been the subject of

discussions between Frank and her friends, all of whom

appear to be quite upset.

. It ig, logical té aseunme ‘that Frank has contacts

faking all of the above factors into consideration,
it might be very timely to direct an anonymous typewritten
letter to T'ANG Wing-chao, Vice Chairman, Chinese People’s ~
Committge on World Peace, Peking, China, [and trailed from
CanadaPin which the writer would express concern regarding
the arvests and purge of the individuals mentioned above.
The writer could point out that he met T'ANG in October,

 

 

 

 

 

1966, and at that tine expressed some concern at the excesses
of the. "Cultural Revolution” and that - these excesses appeared
to be continuing .(6/) ;

fhe writer could further state that his friend
from New York, Sue, a loyal Maoist, and an acquaintance
of T° ANG, conveyed to the writer her deep concern about
the fate of the aforementioned individuals. ‘The writer
could then conclude the letter by stating that he would not
identify himself ox Sue for fear of disclosure of their
identities to the [Panadtan} suthori ties, &®

at would appear that such a letter would
accomplish several objectives. TANG would most certainly
‘know about whom the writer is talking when he referred to

With someone who does not appear to be politically sound.
If Frank is a spotter for the Chinese, this would raise some
question in the minds of the Chinese as to her capability. fun)
