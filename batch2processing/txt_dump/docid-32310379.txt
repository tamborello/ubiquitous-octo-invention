cate any prior contact with KAVNER by Special, Agents of

AVNER's

and 2/2/62 he has no information re any change of
status as a Teamster employee.

KAVNER's possible defection and since our inquiry does not
substantiate this, St. Louis does not recommend interview.

MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING
(Accounting and Fraud Section)

(00 LOS ANGELES)

Re Bureau airtel to SACs, Los Angeles, and St, Louis,
dated 1/25/62.

This case was discussed at length with Mr. CHARLES
SMITH, Departmental Attorney at a conference held 1/31/62, con-
cerning the HOFFA cases presently being: handled by the Los
Angeles Division. In résard to this matter, Mr. SMITH requested
that RICHARD KAVNER be interviewed. He was advised that St.
Louis was at this time, attempting to ascertain if KAVNER has
resigned from, and is disgruntled with the Teamsters Union,
Mr. SMITH said he desires to have KAVNER interviewed at this time
even if he, KAVNER, is or is not still associated with the
Teamsters Union. He feels that KAVNER, having handled the trans-
fer SCHEIB Workers from the IWFL, Local 886, to the Teamsters
Union, is the key to this case, and if KAVNER is willing to
furnish information, he could also be the key to many other
matters concerning the oy a and HOFFA,

In’ view of the request by Department attorney Charles &.
smith, the St. Louis Office is authorized to have two mature,
experiericed Special Agents interview Richard I. Kayner immediately.

This interview must be well-planned by the Agents
assigned to conduct same and they must be thoroughly familiar
with all the details of this matter. If at all possible, Kavner
should be interviewed away from his place of employment or his
home; in amy event care and caution must be exercised to insure
that the interview is not overheard or recorded. In addition,
the interview must be conducted in such a manner so as not to
reveal any information in Bureau files and so that. Kavner will
not become aware that LA 4381-PC and LA~-4350-C have furnished
information to us in this case.

Should Kavner request that an attorney be present during
the interview, you are to be guided by instructions as set forth
on page 18C of the FBI Handbook.

The interview with Kavner should be confined to captioned
matter, If, however, upon being interviewed he indicates a
receptive, cooperative attitude and volunteers information
__ pertaining to other matters same should, of course, be accepted.

AIRTEL TO SAC, ST. LOUIS
RE: JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; SARL SCHEIB; ET AL.
63-7112 :

Bear in mind that LA-4350-C has repeatedly advised Los Angeles

that Kavner ig disgruntied with the Teamsters Union and has

| tried to resign. Any such indication during the interview should
be capitalized upon to the fullest extent possible, as

' Kavner undoubtedly could become a very valuable source of
information should he see fit fo do so. . cote

Handle this matter immediately on a TOP PRIORITY .. —

basis and surad or airtel the same day the interview is conducted
setting forth 'a succinct summary of the results.

NOTE: Kavner is an international organizer of the Teamsters
Union who reportedly works directly: under both Hoffa and Harold J.

Gibbons, tive Vice-President of the Teamsters Union.
LA 4350-C . ‘former Teamsters Union official C7HEA 4
in Los Angeles, Ca ornia, is furnishing information-to

)
| Los Angeles Office on. a confidential basis) has ‘repeatedly
¢ advised that Kavner is. extremely disgruntled with the Teamsters
i Union and has been trying to resign. Within the last few —
| weeks Kavner contacted LA 4350-C and requested ‘his aid in
5 seeking other employment so he could resign. LA’4350-C:
feels Kavner is "ripe for interview." . tt

) . Kavner, according to LA 4350-C, was instrumental in
effecting the transfer of Earl Scheib's contract with the
United Automobile Workers of America to the Teamsters Union.

Interview with Kavner is a logical investigative
step and the Department has now requested that. he be. interviewed. |
