Communist Party's investigation of the
ALBERTSON expulsion continues. It was recently
learned that the Soviets informed DANNY. RUBIN during
his recent trip to the Soviet Union that the docu-
ment which prompted te theecte1 expulsion was a
forgery. This information has greatly upset GUS
HAILL, HALL feéls the Nassau County CP group is
under FBI contrél. The CP probably does mt know
exactly how to proceed at this point, but it is not
likely they will readmit ALBERTSON.(, vw)
