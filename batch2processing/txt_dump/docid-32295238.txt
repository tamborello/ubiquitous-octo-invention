advised that Lt. Commander D. F, SMITH, U. S. Coast Guard, Mobile,

Alabama, advised that the "Granwood" had arrived at Mobile,
Alabama, and was placed in drydock on May 20, 1968. At that

water was being pumped to cool the engines. The force of the
explosion raised the.deck of the engine room approximately four
inches.

bama, indicates that an examination of the "Granwood" shows that —
the hole in the hull of this vessel occurred between frames 31
and 32 from aft, just under the water tank top, amd the plates
of the hull were curled back into the ship by an explosive force.

By communication dated Jume 19, 1968, the Mobile Office
advised that the British freighter "Granwood" had departed from
Mobile, Alabama, under tow for repairs which were to be undertaken
