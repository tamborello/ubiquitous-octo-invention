Ideology and Control of ‘the Newspaper

.10, Mundo Americano is completely under the control of
BATISTA oriented groups and its articles and editorials fol-
iow the line dictated by these groups. The newspaper attacks bad
the U.S. Government, and especially the CIA, daily. Forwarded,
as Attachment No, 2, is a copy of an AP cable, dated 25 October
1965, reporting a statement by the White House Press Chief
and J. Edgar Hoover that the news published in the New York
Herald Tribune stating that the President had authorized the
FBY to gather intelligence abroad is not true. The Mundo
Americano “published a distorted version of the cable (see

achment No, 3) and also an editorial praising President
Johnson's action against CIA (see Attachment No. 4).

11. Rolando MASFERRER Rojas writes a column in the
Mundo ‘Americano using the pen name "Policarpo Pineda", in
which he frequently attacks CIA. Copies of MASFERRER 's
column are attached as Attachment No. 5S.

Blackmail . . . : .

12, On 26 October 1965, Mundo Americano published an
article entitled, “Opposition to the Dynasty of the Somozas"

appeared on the front page of Mundo Americano reporting that
General SOMOZA was gravely i11 in a Baltimore, Maryland,
hospital, According to conversations overheard by source,
after the appearance of these articles, the directors of the
newspaper, including Rolando MASFERRER, were summoned to the
Nictlraguag Embassy in Washington, D.c. At the meeting the
Ambassador from Nicaragu@ pointed out. that the news appearing
in the paper was false, “An argument between the Ambassador —
and HASFERRER ensued and MASFERRER was thrown out of the meet-
ing. After that, a second meeting took place betwedn the
Nicaraguan Ambassador and the directors of the newspaper and

 

SOMOZAs, The directors of Mundo Americano have insinuated
that there has been ‘some financial arrangement. ,

Anside Struggles

13. : When Mundo Americano was first published, Jose LOPEZ

Vilaboy had financial control of the newspaper. Currently,

however, control is in the hands of Rolando MASFERRER Rojas

and Ceferino R, PEREZ Carril. In Cuba, PEREZ Carril campaigned
Aw

politically for BATISTA and
the BATISTA Regime. , ..

Frarcisco CASADO Remedios and Jose M. PEREZ, were
from their positions in Mundo Americano on 19 Sep

t4. Since the newspaper was first published, it's policy
has been controlled by the group having financial control,
Although MASFERRER's and, LOPEZ Vilaboy's groups both follow
the BATISTA line, LOPEZ is in favor of a soft line and HASFERRER ~
ig in favor of a hard 1lin@’, attacking groups and persons with
which he docs not agree, Since MASFERRER and PEREZ have
obtained control of the newspaper,
the U.S. Government and the CIA, LOPEZ is not in favor of
attacking the U.S, Government, the CIA or the Spanish Govern-
ment, MASFERRER, however, states that LOPEZ can do nothing
about it because he no longer controls the newspaper financially.

As a result of the recent shift in power, two of LOPEZ' men,
