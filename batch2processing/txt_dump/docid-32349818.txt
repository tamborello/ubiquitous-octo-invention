Created by ex-Colonel Chateau-Jobert, fnotalied in Sain aince the independence
of? Algeria. In ite publication, Appel, dated 22 Septeater 1962 ond in its
Belitieal sul Social Manifesto in tihich ChateauvJobert expresses its doctrine,
are Pound the principles of the M.P. 13 of Robert Martel and of the "Forces
Noavelles Franeaises” of Doctor Lefevre who made common cuuse with the former

_ O88 leader from Constantinople. Despite wany urgent appeals, Chateau-Jobert refus
to rally to the CNR ani his movement retained its autonomy. Pollowing a © ;

particularly vislent polemle carried on in pauphlets, the uplit between the two
Rovyenents became know te the public. fhe MRC asserts thas in the immediate
future it will devote itself solely to political action an getting a valida

. organization in place in the country for conditioning of the population for the.
takeover of power by violence. So ; — a oe

Lo, Yin effect, although it preserives "neither extoxtions, ner plastic explosions,
- nor hold ups", the MCR urges its folloxers to "grease their weapons and to hide |:
them for future use". It is therefore apparent that under propitious circumstances
recourse to violent action to seize power has been condoned, and several deposita
of avas,. one of which was very large, have recently been cigeovered. In a
principal, the doctrine of the MoR and the personality of ite founder must Limit
the audience of the movement to Catholica of the oxtrefe vignt and te certain

milicary circles.

12. From currently available information on activists; it in apparent that there
