MIRIAM FRIEDLANDER advised NEEDLEMAN on this
occasion that the CCCL rally had been a great success as far
as the speakers and the enthusiasm of those present was
concerned, but that they only had half the audience they
expected, and that they would be lucky to break even,

She stated that the petition campaign had been |
launched, however, and that it promised to be an interesting
and important ons, : :

MIRIAM FRIEDLANDER informed NEEDLEMAN that ‘she was
calling a special meeting of the Advisory Committee of the
. CCCL for theeveming of June 17, 1964, to discuss the meaning of

the Supreme Court decision, as well as the petition campaign.
She indicated that ths CCCL desired to send a certain number
of signatures to the Republican Party National Convention
in July, and about 5,000 signatures to the Democratic Party

* National Convention in August. She told NEEDLEMAN that they
were also considering’ sending. these petitions, with as
many signatures as possible, to every congressman.

Guar ' if it wore to print an article based on a. letter

was sending to the Warren Commission, According to
ON, LANE claimed to have information that a story told by a
anitor who had seen LEE HARVEYOSWALD (at the time of the

" a8sassination of President KENNEDY, November 22, 1963) was
actualiy a "phony" story planted by the Secret Service,

NIXON told NEEDLEMAN that he was planning to use this as an
exclusive news story, NEEDLEMAN was of the opinion that unless
LANE had an affidavit from the janitor or some such proof, the
janitor could bring suit against the paper, He suggested that
NIXON discuss this possibility with LANE,
