Assistant Attorney General

PUBLIC BANK OF DETROIT

 
   
  
   
   
    
    

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
has completed an examination of the Public Bank in Detroit,
Michigan. Attached hereto are the results of the examination
together with detailed allegations of specific violations
and irregularities.

By necessity the examination by FDIC was confined
to the bank itself. Therefore, because of the possibility
of a conspiracy, it is imperative that further investigation
be conducted.

In this respect it is requested that the Bureau
thoroughly investigate this matter. William P. French and
J. Paul Allred, Criminal Division Attorneys who are familiar
with this matter have been directed to make themselves available
to the Bureau and assist in any manner requested.
