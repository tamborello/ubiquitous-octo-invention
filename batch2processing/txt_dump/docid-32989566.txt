Kelley took charge. , ~

The Staff has advised the Committee that under Director
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse. The
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli
gence operations, and less on purely domestic surveillance.
The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in
developing policies and standards for intelligence. These
are welcome developments. .

Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved,
Therefore, we have invited Director Kelley to share with the
Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress
should take into account in thinking about the future of
FBI intelligence. Among these issues are whether FBI surveil~}
lance should extend beyond the investigation of persons
likely to commit specific crimes; whether there should be
outside supervision or approval before the FBI conducts certai

types of investigations or uses certain surveillance techniques;

|
|
whether foreign related intelligence activities should, be
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement
functions, and what should be done to the information already
in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in

the future. |

The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange

of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney

 
 

dmn 4 . : 2450.

1 General Levi tomorrow, and with both the FBI and the Justice
2 Department in the next months as the Committee considers

3 recommendations that will strengthen the American people's

Phone (Aran 202) §44-6000

4 confidence in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That

5. confidence is vital for the effective enforcement of Federal
6 law and for the security of the nation against foreign

7 espionage.

8 Director Kelley, we are pleased to welcome you, and if

| 9 you would have a prepared statement you would like to lead off

 

10 with, please proceed.

9 The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation
10 extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over
11 the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the
a

14 clarify the Bureau‘s intelligence responsibility.
15 It is important to remember from the outset that this
16 Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's
, 17 activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic
18 intelligence operations. We have consistently expressed our
3 19 admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative
: 20 and law enforcement work, and we recognize the vital importanc
H 21 of counterespionage in the modern world, But domestic
3 :
u 22 intelligence has raised many difficult questions.
