JOSEPH FRANCI CIVELLO, aka.
AR

 

Re Bureau letter to Dallas, 9/5/61. -

. Based on a file review, as instructed in relet,
b . °° the following observations and recommendations are set,
fo. forth for the Bureau's consideration.

7 Information that CIVELLO is "boss in Texas" .
answering to a “commission” that controls organized crime
in Canada and the United States came from NY-3123-C* ‘on
. ~ 1/23/61. On 3/31/59, DL-105-C described CIVELLO as the top
, : ranking member of an Italian criminal organization
; : sometimes referred to as the "mafia", in the Dallas area

(report SA MILTON L. NEWSOM, 6/23/59, Dallas). Informant
based this information on a. statement that CIVELLO achieved |
this rank during his more active years and primarily because
a of a murder CIVELLO committed in 1928. He stated CIVELLO — j
shot one JOE DeCARLO with a sawed-off shotgun in a drug Ee
store in Dallas on 7/14/28. CIVELLO was exonerated of the /¥
murder charges after claiming the shooting was accidental. is
Informant claimed the murder was ordered by the’ “organization”
after DeCARLO had attempted to hold out a considerable sum of.
money accumulated through illegal activities. Informant -
was pressed for facts concerning the above and stated that
this information came from him indirectly-and he has no
information concerning actual proof of: the above but is
convinced that the information is correct.

of the group that met at Apalachin but had reiterated that
CI'-ELLO would be the number 1 man of any operation sponsored
’ by the group in Dallas. In Dallas airtel to the Bureau,
2/26/58 entitled, Meeting of Hoodlums, Apalachin, New York,
11/14/57, AR, Dallas advised that this informant stated
that CIVELLO had reported to those in attendance at the
meeting that Dallas has never had an organized syndicate
and will never have one. He said CIVELLO pointed out that
there were small time gamblers and hoodlums who on individual
basis had operated in the past but who never had any national
connections. CIVELLO reportedly told the group that the
Italians in the Dallas area were not strong enough to gain
control,

Informant has continued to state that CIVELLO and
his associates are unable to organize any illegal activity
due to local, city and county administration in the Dallas
area,

On 7/28/61, DL-105-C advised he could furnish no
further details concerning investments CIVELLO has made in
oil leases for himself and other Italians and had no
details concerning the legal or illegal activities concerning
the "Italian group" from which CIVELLO allegedly derives
2% of the proceeds. Informant said he gathered this informa~
tion over a period of time from conversations with CIVELLO's
associates and by his observation of dealings made in the
past. He said he could furnish no specific details as most
of the information was hearsay and his personal opinion.

In report of SA VINCENT E, DRAIN, 1/29/58 considerable
information was furnished by PCI HODGES DUBOISE HAMILTON
who at that time was secretary to HARRY DAVID KAHN, Oil Broker.
Information reflects CIVELLO began contacting KAHN in 1955
relative to investing money in wildcat oil drilling. Informant
said CIVELLO invested $19,000 in 1955 for interest in 8 oil
wells known as the Caddo Levee Production near Oil City, La.
CIVELLO's interest in these wells was 9/64 working interest.
Informant further advised CIVELLO invested $3937.50 in 1957
on the drilling of two new wells at the same location.
Informant also advised CIVELLO had 1/16 interest in the
R. E, Collins Lease in Caddo Parish, La. near Shreveport,
which was later either sold or given to his brother CHARLES
EDWARD CIVELLO, CIVELLO reportedly had 1/6 working interest
in the Swinney Lease, Caddo County, Okla. which is located
near Cement, Okla.

PCI stated that in 1955 CIVELLO brought the following
. itidividuals to the office of HARRY DAVID KAHN and told KAHN
he wanted to put up money for investment purposes for a wild-
reat well that was being drilled in Throckmorton, Texas...
/ Informant stated this hole was drilled and it was a dry hole
‘ and all interested parties lost the money they had placed in

[ ame. The interested investors were as follows:

The development of Di-105-C as a live informant
in cowering CIVELLO's current and past activities has been
difficult in that informant has been closely connected with
CIVELLO and his associates all his life, he himself being
an Italian. He has furnished information concerning CIVELLO
reluctantly and indirectly. Every effort has been made to
have him provide factual basis for his statements so that
information could be properly evaluated.

Dallas will continue to probe CIVELLO's activities
in regard.to investments and financial dealings. Throughout :
this investigation CIVELLO has not been actively engaged in !
any criminal activity since the Apalachin Meeting and has i
not been known to have any organization, directed by him
in Texas, Investigation indicates CIVELLO is in a stand~-
by position.

In regard to top hoodlum investigation concerning
associates of CIVELLO, the Dallas Office has investigated
his principal associates, JOE IANNI, DL 92-192; PETER ;
PELLEGRINO, DL 92-198; JOHNNY ROSS PATRONO, DL 92-231;
FRANK TORTORIELLO, DL 92-196. Additional top hoodium cases i
will be opened concerning any associate developed who
appears to meet the requirements for a top hoodlum investi-
gation.

: Continued efforts will be made to identify the
CHARLIE GORDON referred to by DL-105-C. Every effort will be
made to be aware of the identities of tie-ins between
hoodlums in the Dallas area and other sections of the
country as pointed out in relet.

The effectiveness of a highly confidential source
is well recognized as a means of obtaining coverage for
