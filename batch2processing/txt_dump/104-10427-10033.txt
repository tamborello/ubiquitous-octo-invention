MEMORANDUM FOR: George Frates
Chief, Records Systems Branch, RMD

FROM : Jon E. Wolfe, RSB
SUBJECT : Status of Records Related to the HSCA Investigation

1, Attached for your perusal is the draft of an item scheduling
the CIA's HSCA-related records. I Suggest that this item be added to
the OLC records control schedule (as a restricted item) and submitted to
NARS for formal disposition approval. (Col. Tagge of NARS has reviewed
the draft item and its disposition and is in basic agreement.)

to their original locations. All other records, such as those which
have already been duplicated on Paper and those which were generated as
the result of the investigation will not be filmed,

ilming is currently underway in the DDO and is being done by
lin, I believe, a new location on the sixth floor. The
1s not only filming and verifying its own files but also those of

the Office of Personnel. One estimate I have heard is that it will
require the DDO about one year to complete the job.

4. Filming is also either underway or being planned in the Office
of Security. This process will be overseen by Jack Sullivan. The only
other film we have consists of DDS&T footage on the U-2. I have been
told that the latter is probably part of a permanent record series. If
it is, I suggest that it not be duplicated but rather cross-referenced

5. _Records that will be retired as paper are located in NFAC,
DDO, and OLC. I suggest that each of the holding components be respon-
sible for boxing, shelf listing, and sealing their respective records
and that all be retired under one job number. I further suggest that
once we are in our new vaulted area (sometime in December?) that we
serve as the focal point for collecting and depositing these records.
