Mr. Szule. He didn't ase -the word. I think this was

my word to describe him. I think more precisely he did not
use the expression.

Mr. Szule. If that's ceally relevant to you and T can

look at my calendar and give you the precise date of it. It

would have been late March, early April.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, I think it would be relevant if we

want to check it out with anybody else.

Mx. Szule. That's easy.

Mr. Schwarz. Where dii the conversation take place?

Mr. Szule. It took place in the home of a mutual friend

the mutual friend's house and loose ends were wrapped up at
dinner. |

Mr. Kirbow. What was the friend's name?

Mr. Aaron. Can we ask a different question?

Was your mutual friend a party to the conversation?

Mr. Szule. Yes, ha was present.

Mr. Szule. I would have the same problem that I had with
the other question on sourc:2s. ‘I have no difficulty here,

I would make the request, if I may --

Mr. Kirbow. Certainly.

Mr. Szule. Because it does involve a friendship here.

Mr. Kirbow. Apparently Mr. Angleton's a personal friend
of yours too.

Mr. Szule. No, I woulin't describe him as a personal
friend. I would describe him as an acquaintance, a good
acquaintance.

The mutual friend is Benjamin Wells who_is a former

I do not like to be in a position of violating confidences,

situations where people are trying to be helpful.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, I think in this case the individual
does have evidence. The other individuals were just sources,
and there's a distinction tetween this and the other.

Now it seems to me if Mr. Angleton confirms this story
then anybody else's testimcny I suppose is irrelevant.

Do you agree with me, Charlie?

Mr. Schwarz. Did you jiscuss with Mr. Angleton whether or

Mr. Szule. No, I did rot. I did not raise the question, ,
I suppose because among othr things because of the limitation
of time and because my main ‘effort at that point was to try
to corroborate to my own satisfaction that such an operaticn
occurred and to obtain from Angleton as much as I could of
corroboration or denial, which was done in the form of
transcribing.

Mr. Kirbow. Let me get it absolutely clear so that there.

I told Angleton that 1 would handle the story in the most
careful way, which is the way in which it appears, or will

Mr. Angleton chose not to go into a question which I

with the knowledge and the authorization of the President of
the United States at the t:me or the National Security Council,
the Atomic Energy Commissicn and/or other departments of the
government who would norma! ly be responsible for transfer or
clearance for transfer of classified information in the nuclear

by the CIA as represented, and as represented by CI, the

counterintelligence was classified information, technical _ a

assistance, and the availability of one or more distinguished
nuclear scientists or physicists whose services were available
to the United States governnent.

I, based on information which I had from my original
source, asked Mr. Angleton whether he could confirm that
a British born scientists whose name, upon investigation,
turns out to be Mann -- M-a-n-n -~ first name Wilfred Basil
or Basil Wilfred -- again 1 can correct the record at that --
where Mr. Mann, or Dr. Manr I should say, was indeed one of
the scientists involved in this operation. Mr. Anqleton
confirmed that indeed this was the case.

He cautioned me that any oublication of Dr. Mann's
involvement in Mr. Angletor 's words could be enormously

explosive, damaging to the national security of the United

States, damaging to our intelligence assets and also enormously

dangerous to Dr. Mann perscnally. In effect, Mr. Angleton
said at one point that shoild I surface Mr. Mann's name,
Dr. Mann's name, he may go as far as commit suicide.

I asked for an explanétion and Mr. Angleton told me that
Dr. Mann; who was a British citizen at the time, who in the |
‘50's was part of the joint. U.S.-British nuclear group based

at the British Embassy in Washington, was found by
