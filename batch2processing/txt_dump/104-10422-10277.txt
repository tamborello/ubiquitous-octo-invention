SUBJECT: Comments on Book V of the Final Report of the U.S. Senate
Select Conmittee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities

1. Book V of the SSC Final Report, titled The Investigation

of the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy: Performance of the
Intelligence Agencies, presents a number of issues that address themselves
to the conscience of the Agency. The criticisms of CIA are based on a
series of presentations of how various investigative leads were handled,
and on the non-reporting of various Agency operational activities that
the SSC Final Report judges to have been relevant to the Warren
Commission inquiry.

2.  <A-stated thesis of the SSC Final Report is that the operations
of the intelligence agencies against Cuba exercised a negative influence
on the quality of their support for the Warren Commission investigation.
The following statements appear in the Report:

"It (the SSC Report) places particular
emphasis on the effect their Cuban opera-
tions seemed to have on the investigation.”
Page 2.
"They (senior CIA officials) should have
realized that CIA operations against Cuba,
particularly operations involving the
assassination of Castro, needed to be con-
sidered in the investigation. Yet, they
directed their subordinates to conduct
an investigation without telling. them of

these vital facts." Page 7.

The significance of these statements, to the authors of the SSC
Report, is highlighted as follows:
"Certainly, concern with public reputation,
probiems of coordination between agencies,
possible bureaucratic failure and embarrassment,
and the extreme compartmentation of knowledge
of sensitive operations may have contributed to
these shortcomings. But the possibility
exists that senior officials in both agencies
made conscious decisions not to disclose —
potentially important information." Page 7.

A central feature of the rationale is the concept that if Castro
had learned of these activities it would have provoked him into
retaliation against President Kennedy. The SSC Final Report makes
it clear that it feels this theory should have been perceived and
accepted at the time by the intelligence agencies (not to mention
the Warren Commission) leading to a review of the various anti-Castro
programs to see what it might reveal.

The provocation theory, in the specific form postulated by the

> SSC Final Report and the press, is of more recent vintage than the .

perceptions that prevailed in 1964 when the Warren Commission was con-
ducting its investigation. There was a general concern in 1964 that :

the USSR or Cuba might be behind the assassination of President

INSPECTOR GENERAL

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

FROM : §. D. Breckinridge
Deputy Inspector General

SUBJECT : Comments on Book V¥, SSC Final Report, The

Investigation of the Assassination of President
Kennedy: Performance of the Intelligence Agencies

1. Forwarded herewith is the report of a review that Mr.
Knoche requested last fall. The undersigned was designated. as
chairman or coordinator of an Agency working group that was to 3
; conduct the study. It proved a more ambitious undertaking than
had been anticipated. The extensive files of CI Staff on the :
Warren Commission inquiry into President Kennedy's assassination :
were reviewed in detail, as were the very large file holdings of
LA Division on its Cuban operations during the period preceding
i+. and following the death of President Kennedy. The most pains-
— taking review and analysis was required, and the files proved to
be so extensive that the research became a major task. The files
of the Office of Security and the Office of the Inspector General
presented a less formidable problem.

. 2. The attached report, with its annexes, is the formal :
result of the effort. If the attachments seem bulky, it is
noted that additional back-up materials are being held for the
record in the event of future inquiry. These papers represent
the result of a conscientious and painstaking effort, conducted
with high standards of review and testing kept foremost in mind.
We believe that there is little likelihood of oversight.or omission
in coverage; the work was so extensive and carefully done that we
feel there is small chance of surprises remaining in (CIA Files on
this subject. --

3. In brief, we found that many: of the presentations of :
Book V of the Final Report of the Senate Select Committee were ~
based on incomplete information or distorted perceptions. While S
the record of CIA was not perfect, the performance at the time,
under the understanding of the period, seems reasonable. The fact
| remains that evidence of a Castro conspiracy to assassinate President
i Kennedy still has not been discovered. The Warren Commission and

CIA could well have perceived tthe usefulness of inquiring into
specific sources of possible provocation of Castro at the time of
the 1964 investigation; it is clear that the general consideration
was recognized by all concerned, and pursued, but the concept of
specific possible provocations was not. A review into such possi-
bilities has now been conducted, with essentially negative results.

4. The report Ts not ta be considered a report of the
Inspector General, as such, being the result of a representative
working group. However, the report should be considered as being
for internal CIA consumption only. It contains third agency reports,
liaison reports, and involves sources and methods materials, as well
as evaluation and comment of a nature that is advisory to manage-
ment. Any release of this report: and its annexes outside the Agency,
even in classified form, would require considerable sanitization.

It is recommended that this report be held against future inquiries,
providing a basis for appropriate responses, and that it not be
volunteered at this time.
