Re: CARLOS, MARCELLO

indictments, the FBI arrest Carlos and Joseph Marcello. . The New Orleans Division

-is making an. immediate check to determine if the Marcéllos are in New Orleans . |
at this time. i

ACTION BEING TAKEN

 

- SAC Maynor is pointing out. to-the Department. attorneys the
notorious: chéxeoeee of the: ‘Marcellos.and the fact that Carlos Marcéllo’was able
-to.surreptitiously re-enter. the United’ States following: his‘deportation. Under
these:circumstances, jit is essential that. the Department attorneys arrange’ to.
have.a-secret indictment ‘returned which. is to be unsealed when the. arrests are
made, ‘if the FBI is to’ make the arrest. SAC Maynor will advise the Bureau
_promptly when.a determination is‘ made if the Marcellos are’ in New Orleans today;
‘however, the: Department.attorneys are not to be. informed in. this regard,

2... Since the FBI.has conducted the investigation relating to the
perj ury and Fraud Against the Government charges, it-would.be’proper for us to ;
make:the-arrest.. We should, however, control this situation and secret. indictments
are essential.

 

3. Inasmuch,as Carlos: Marcello is one of the 40 prime targets for
‘prosecution under. the: Attorney General's drive against organized. crime, it would
appear. the. press: release once the. arrests are. made should ‘emanate, from
Washington: It is believed-that DeLoach should get in. touch with Ed Guthman of
the Department to insure’ that we receive: proper™ Tecognition. for our assistance in
this.case. .
