' DETAILS : On September 28, 1969, MM Tol; a Cuban

exile leader at "Miami , who had, during
. . the summer of 1964, ‘associated nis
organization with JURE, stated’ that as of September 28,
1964, the reputation of JURE among Cuban exiles had-
seriously deteriorated, and JURE leader MANUEL RAY re-
mained a prisoner of his much publicized promise to be in
Cuba by May, 1964.

MM Tol g@dvised that there had been considerable
financial. mismanagement within JURE, wherein money was

wasted on firearms that were defective and which could

have been purchased on the open market at.a better price
than was obtained by JURE from the ERQUIAGA Arms Company
of Los Angeles, California.

™ T-1 Stated that efforts by MANUEL RAY to make |

an infiltration of Cuba during May, and again on two
occasions during July, 1964, had failed, with the result
that what contacts he had in Cuba were no longer in a

' position to:.assist RAY because of the jeopardy involved.

Do

According to MM T-1, MANUEL RAY was excessive-
ly concerned with maintaining relationships with JUAN
BOSCH, the deposed President of the Dominican Republic;
Governor LUIS MUNOZ MARIN ef Puerto Rico, and "PEPE"
FIGUERAS, former Costa Rican President; with the result
that JURE? s:ability to obtain assistance from the Dominican
Republic and a base in that country were hampered.

MM T-1 stated that the principal defect in the
leadership of MANUEL RAY is the fact that he is extreme-
ly ambitious and conceited, and sees:himself as the next
