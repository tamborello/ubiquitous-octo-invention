MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT? "American Defectors to the USSR"

1, The attached material was part of a soft file entitled
‘American Defectors to the USSR", which was set up by SR/6
(Support) around 1960 and maintained by various SR components

“until ca. 1963, The compilations were derived from a variety
of sources, and contein both classified and overt data,

. 2. Inthe fall of 1966, the files were turned over to CI
a Staff. In most instances, basic ‘information was then abstracted
a, : for the US Defector Machine Program, In all instances in which
i the material was unique, or represented a valuable collation effort,
it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with
a copy of this memorandum,

3. It is suggested that any dissemination of this data should
be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MRO), in >
view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that
disseminations have already been made through the US Defector
Machine Program,
