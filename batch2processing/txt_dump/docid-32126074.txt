‘He saw no moré of TEWFIQ until Wednesday,
11/27/63, when they met in an Arab cafe in Leman Street,
much used by Arabs of various nationalities and classes.
They exchanged a few words on that occasion, and TEWFIQ
asked for HASSAN's home address, promising to visit him a
there shortly .(6)

Egyptian acquaintance to visit the Egyptian ship "El

seen him since. Two letters and a photo were found in
the flat by HASSAN, evidently left behind by TEWFIQ;
