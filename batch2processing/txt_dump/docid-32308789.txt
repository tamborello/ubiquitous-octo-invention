other informed sources, pointed out that bookmaking and i
gambling in South Florida is at least a $50,000,000.00

a year business and that the established racketeers are not

going to give it up even though some of their underlings

may have to go to the penitentiary. Most everyone agrees

that the day of the plush gambling casino is over though

all expect that there will be floating crap games and a num-_

par of roulette wheels, etc., operating on a sneak basis.

. ARTHURYNEWMAN, a gambler originally from New York
City, who has b associated with “Lefty” CLARK and other
nationelly prominent gamblers in the past, recently advised
that he and his partners have opened three cigar stores in
which they hoped to operate handbooks if given an "OK."
This was before the enactment of the new income tax law .
which would effect bookmaking operations. NEWMAN, who about
a year ago married SALLY HERBERT, widow of NEDDIE H#RBERT,
the henchman of MICKEY COHEN who was slain in Los Angeles,
California, advised that his partners in the cigar stores,
which have been organized under the _narie the Johnina
Tobacco Company, Incorporated, are PHILIP KOVALICK, alias
"Little Farvel," FBI #120992, and ABI BROWN, Miami Beach
PD #C-89918. The Johnina Tobacco Company, Inc., has one ‘
cigar. store in the Johnina Hotel, 6981 Collins avenue, Miami
Beach, another, on 4lst Street, Miami Beach, and the third at
9460 Harding Avenue, Surfside, Florida. PHIL KOVALICK was
formerly the bodyguard of the late BENJAMIN "Bugsy" SEIGEL
and is now on very friendly terms with MEYER LANSK d other
membors of the National Gambling Syndicate, ABI OWN is °
the brother-in-law of NAT HERTZFELD, president of’ Tropical -
Park Race Track and has an extensive criminal record for
various serious crimes.

Confidential Informants such as DAVE SHIFRON’ (MF-334), >
have advised that as far as bookmaking is presently con+ if
cerned, there is no major *action" in the Miami or Miami

Beach area and the professional players who ordinarily

have been betting on "hot" horses are not able to "get down.".
They have also stated there are practically no organized
betting. of college and professional football games at the
present time as most bookmakers are now afraid to "make a move."

The MANNERINO gang came to the attention of the
Miami Office during the 1950-1951 Winter Season when
Gonfidentail Informant MF-334 (DAVE SHIFRON), agya potest ;
SAMEYYMANNERINO had an interest in gambling at t ns Souci
Hotel near Havana, Cuba. No known illegal activity on the
part of the members of the MANNwRINO Gang in the Miami area
was leanred. However, MF-334 stated that the MANNERINOs
formerly operated the cocktail lounge in the Mlbion Hotel,
~Miami. Beach, which was a notorious hoodlum hangout. This
place was apparently fronted for this combination by one
NORMIEMROTHMAN. Unsubstantiated rumor in underworld circles >
was to the effect that the MANNERINOs sold their interest oe
to one JIMMY'ARDEN, an Italian racketeer from the Pittsburgh,. “
‘Pennsylvania, area. In conversation with the writer, CARDEN
claimed he was the owner of the Albion Cocktail Lounge, and
while admitting that the MANNERINOs had been formerly associ-
ated with it, claimed they were no longer active and had no
financial interest in this establishment. :
