intractable in relation to a’ lésser matters, LA ROCCA would
not hesitate to. authorize a "hit. " !

The idea held by. LA ROCCA that greater mutual
benefit and profit could result by peaceful arbitration
gradually proved its soundnesSs to other racketeers in the

‘Pittsburgh area and the result*is- that there have been fewer

"mob killings" in the Pittsburgh district than in any other
city of comparable population: ‘Another result came about
because of this new LA ROCCA: thinking, All of the members
of La Cosa Nostra in the Pittsburgh area became "workers."
The old policy of having stooges: and outsiders control the
operation of a gambling establishment-while the leader sat
back and merely shared’ in the profits was abandoned, No

‘longer: would the leader pick up his business with a staff of

“musclemen," but these. musclemen; became actively engaged in
the: administration of the: numerous gambling establishments

 

This informant stated that when he was a young man,
"in my early 20's," GIOVANNZ: BAZZANO was very fond of him and
frequently used him as a chauffeur. When BAZZANO was killed
by numerous ice pick stabs in New-York City, however, everyone
knew he had it coming and feit-no pity for him. BAZZANO is

buried in a cemetery in the New: Kensington, Pao, area,

according to this informant. ~ a

PG T=4 advised that: in the late 1920's and early
1930's, the two top groups: in the Mafia in the Pittsburgh area
were headed by JOHN CANCELLIERI (deceased) of the North Side,
and the VOLPE brothers. of Wilmerding, Pa., headed by: JOHNNY

“VOLPE (deceased), also known: as: “Prince Johnny." He stated

that: JOHNNY VOLPE was shot down ‘in July, 1932, on Wylie ;
Avenue, Pittsburgh, with his brothers, JIMMY and ARTHUR, ~
LOUIS VOLPE and JOE VOLPE are the younger surviving brothers.

‘JOHN CANCELLIERI died about 1965, and left his Rosa Villa

Restaurant at Sandusky and East General Robinson Streets to

_ his: grandsons , JOHN and SAM.” The father of these two boys,

SAM, died in 1947, and was an’ active Mafia man, The informant

Was. not..certain.of.the sons! affiliation .with.La Cosa Nostra

but. knows that meetings are Held.at the. Rosa Villa Restaurant

between LA. ROCCA, the’ MANNARINOs * and TONY .RIPEPI: periodically.

He advised that in'1957, he made a visit to Italy
and learned that the Mafia members around Florence and Milan

-,all- claim to be Sicilians, even if they are Italian born.

He advised: further that there was ..a gangland murder in the

and the brother of the victim witnessed the slaying, and
still would not admit to the’ Carabinieri that they saw any-

 

Informant advised: further regarding marriages that.
formerly the members arranged the: matches when their children

‘were still quite young... He stated a good example is the BAZZANO-}

RIPEPI marriage. He knows this"was arranged. as he has been

a long-time associate and friend:of TONY RIPEPI. He: further
stated that the marriage of TONY RIPEPI’s oldest: daughter

to COSTANZA (STANLEY) VALENTI ‘of* Rochester, Pa., was arranged
in a like fashion. This VALENTI is a brother of FRANK VALENTI,

‘whom’ RIPEPI sponsored: into La* ‘Cosa: Nostra,

He advised: further’ that STANLEY VALENTI refuses to

‘allow his wife to even visit’her: parents in Pittsburgh and

that he does not know the reason ‘for this, but knows that
there is bad blood between them,” The informant advised
regarding the term La Cosa Nostra, that he first heard this

used after the testimony of JOSEPH VALACHI. ‘He advised he

always..knew.of it locally.as "The Outfit." His interpretation

‘of the phrase La Cosa Nostra. is."our own home" or "our own

well-bein “ with emphasis on the Your own."

PG T=5 has advised that when he was a boy in
Pittsburgh, "the syndicate”: bombed a grocery store owned by
his: father on Clay Way. in the lower Hill District because
his father had refused to pay $10,000 which was demanded for
the protection of his property. He said that the group of
specialized extortionists was known as the “Red Masks."

He recalled that the group picked only on Italians and not.

-/on native-born American citizens’ because it was felt that

the Italians would not talk or report their troubles to the

‘police. .He stated that this group would actually seek out

-.. laborers and hard-working’ people’ who were earning from $1,00
to $1.25 a day and extort their meager savings from them

IN

through threats. Their targets’ were carefully selected
and,each was sent a letter containing a small red mask.
They obtained their name from: this practice,

” The aforementioned” ‘informant recalled that the

- leader in the lower Hill District at the turn of the century

was DOMINICK DE. FARNANDO, who was also known as "Don"
De Farnando, Following: the bombing of his father's business
