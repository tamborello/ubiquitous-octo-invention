CIA AND THE POLITICAL SECTION HAD AN ADVANCE OPPORTUNITY

TO REFUTE OR QUALIFY INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPED BY MY OFFICE PRIOR
TO IT BEING TRANSMITTED TO FBIHQ. AARON ASKED WHAT I WOULD

BO IF THE AMBASSADOR ORDERED ME NOT TO REPORT A SPECIFIC

ITEM OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH I HAD DEVELOPED TO FBIHQ. I

TOLD AARON THAT IN MY JUDGEMENT THE INTERESTED COMPONENTS OF
THE EMBASSY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AFFORDED A SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITY TO
REVIEW INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPED BY ME PRIOR TO IT BEING REPORTED
TO FBIH@. ANSWERING THE LATTER QUESTION I TOLD AARON I COULD

| NOT VISUALIZE THE AMBASSADOR FORBIDDING ME TO REPORT SPECIFIC -
INTELLIGENCE I HAD DEVELOPED TO FBIHQ AND NOTED THAT ANY OBJECTION
RAISED BY THE AMBASSADOR TO THIS INTELLIGENCE WOULD CERTAINLY
4LSO BE REPORTED TO FBIHQ. I SUGGESTED THAT AARON TAKE UP THIS
POINT WITH AMBASSADOR HILL. I ALSO NOTED THAT THERE WERE MANY
INSTANCES WHERE SOCAALLED INTELLIGENCE OF ONLY

LOCAL INTEREST HAD BEEN DEVELOPED BY ME AND REPORTED TO THE
AMBASSADOR AND OTHER EMBASSY COMPONENTS, BUT NOT REPORTED TO

FBIHQ. AARON REQUESTED I PROVIDETTIN WITH THE GENERAL NATURE
OF INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPED AND REPORTED BY THIS OFFICE TO THE
EMBASSY AND FBIHQ. {I TOLD AARON THAT GENERALLY INTERNATIONAL
AND LOCAL TERRORISM WERE THE PRIME TOPICS OF MY

REPORTING.

AARON ASKED WHETHER THERE WAS A SPECIAL REASON FOR THE
FBI°S EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON IN 1978. I TOLD AARON
THAT I WAS NOT PERSONALLY AWARE OF ANY SPECIAL REASON FOR THE
1976 EXPANSION ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS BASIC FACT THAT FBI
FOREIGN LIAISON OPERATIONS REQUIRED ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL
OVERSEAS TO EFFECTIVELY MEET THE FBI'S INCREASING RESPONSI ~
BILITIES. I SUGGESTED THAT AARON CONTACT FBIHQ IF HE DESIRED
ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THIS REGARD.

AARON ASKED WHETHER THE CIA STATION HAD EVER REQUESTED
MY OFFICE TO SECURE DATA FROM “FBI COMPUTER BANKS” ON ARGENTINE
RESIDENTS OF CIA INTEREST, WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY RESIDED IN THE
UNITED STATES. I TOLD AARON THAT NO SUCH REQUEST BY CIA HAD
EVER BEEN MADE OF ME AND THAT IF SUCH A REQUEST WAS RECEIVED
IN THE FUTURE THE CIA STATION WOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO MAKE

HE PERSONALLY FEELS THAT THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF THE COMMITTEE TO
AFFORD AN OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF U. S. INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS HAD

AMBIT 10US YOUNG MAN, WHO IS BASICALLY A POLITICAL ANIMAL. TRUE-
HEART NOTED THAT AARON WAS DIRECTLY APPOINTED TO THE CHURCH COMMITTEE
BY SENATOR WALTER MONDALE. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT TRUEHEART DOES
NOT THINK VERY MUCH OF AARON.

_ ON SEPTEMBER 26, 1975, I MET PRIVATELY WITH AARON AND TRUEHEART
IN MY OFFICE. AS IN THE CASE WITH LEGAT, BRASILIA, OF THE TWO
AARON PLAYED A DOMINANT ROLE DURING THE MEETING. AARON COMMENCED
BY STATING THAT THE OPERATIONS OF LEGAT, BRASILIA, AND BUENOS
AIRES WERE REALLY NOT THE TYPE OF LEGAT OPERATIONS HE DESIRED
TO REVIEW, INDICATING THAT LEGAT, MEXICO CITY'S OPERATIONS WERE
MORE OF THE TYPE IN WHICH HE WAS INTERESTED.

AARON ASKED POINTED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE MECHANICS OF 1

sources in Mexico City and Brasilia were necessary in order for
