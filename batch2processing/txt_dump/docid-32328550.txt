Information furnished by DIAZ is too numerous
to set forth in letter form, however, the above summary
should indicate to the Bureau the importance of the
information which this PSI has furnished.

The Miami Office has kept in mind the possibility
that DIAZ may be a plant or may be cooperating with the
-FBI for the purpose of protecting his citizenship. The
. Miami Office also has realized that DIAZ or anyother source
or informant, in. the field of Latin American affairs may
possib] use. ‘his-association with, the FBI to his own advantge
at -some- future. date, It is further recognized that’ a
great. many individuals: -who furnish information to the FBI may
have-an:ulterior motive in doing so, that they may be.
opportunists or mercenaries :and that the furnishing of
information might be a self-serving action. Information a
furnished by DIAZ, however, has been. found to be reliable . a
and has enabled the Bureau to keep abreast of the Cuban J
situation at those times when DIAZ happened, _by virtue of \
his position, to be within the focus of attention. No |
‘promises, payments, or written records were furnished to
this informant in return for his voluntary cooperation.

 

 

In view of DIAZ“s present position with Cubana
Airlines, he has lost a large degree of his. former potential .
as an informant of Latin American matters and accordingly, ‘ i
no further ‘action is being taken toward his development ~ ; (
as a PSI; however, UACB, DIAZ will be recontacted from time
to time as a source of information and in regard to specific.
matters which may arise, ‘such as request for information set }
. ‘forth in Bureau teletype dated November 12, 1959, regarding
; the influx of several thousand leaflets published by the
: Cuban Government regarding the recent leaflet flight by
PEDRO LUIS DIAZ LANZ, et al. These leaflets allegedly arrived
in the United States by Cubana Airlines.
