'(3) above concerns a statement under "Administrative" |

in the report of SA JAMES P, HOSTY, JR., dated 12/12/62 to the

effect effort would be made to interview one DELBERT RAY, It |
was believed an interview with him might throw some light on an

organization involving ASHLAND H, BURCHWELL and others, the \

detail of which was possibly related to instant case, but also \

was of particular pertinence to the case entitled "UNNAMED \

ORGANIZATION OF DALLAS, TEXAS, PATRIOTS, IS-X", Bufile 100-439412,
Dallas file 105-1475...

principally a lead in the IS-X case. As pointed out in. Dallas
airtel to the Bureau of 10/4/62 in that case, in which communi-
cation the name of RAY appears, any interview of individuals
possibly connected with this organization was being held in
‘abeyance awaiting a more definite determination of its nature.

An effort was being made in this latter regard through interviews
with former DL-18-S and ASHLAND F, BURCHWELL in instant case, as
reflected by Dallas airtels in the IS-X case dated 11/23/62,
12/5/62 and 1/8/63, It will be noted a copy of the report of

SA JAMES P, HOSTY, JR., in the Desegregation case dated 12/12/62 .
was designated for the IS-X case file. This was done because of J
the information on the administrative pages of this report perti-
nent to the. I8-x case, including the interview of RAY,

The interview of ‘RAY was looked upon, therefore, as |
t
|

Upon receipt of Bureau airtel of 1/11/63, steps were ~ \
immediately taken to locate and interview RAY. This was accom-

i
plished on 1/14/63 and reported in the report of SA HOSTY dated
1/15/63 in ‘the Desegregation case.

On instruction of the Bureau in its letter of 1/24/63, 2
the IS-X case has now been closed, and activity of this group
will be followed through contact with former DL-18- Ss.

The delays in connection with above matter, particularly
with respect to (1) and (2), are sincerely regretted by me, and

I most certainly will see that such delays are not chargeable
to me in the future.

With reference to Item (3), I feel my explanation :
gives logical reason why RAY was not interviewed in connection
with the Desegregation case, and I regret the Bureau was not

previously fully informed as to the reason RAY was not inter-
viewed in that case,
