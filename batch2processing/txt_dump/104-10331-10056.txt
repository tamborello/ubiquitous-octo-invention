Dear Kireten:

The GIA has, through you, suggested that it might conduct
additional searches for récords pertaining to my client, Mr.
Lavrence P. Kaenan, if Mx. Keefian furnished additional infermation
which enabled it to conduct auch searchaa. Although Mr. Keenan be-
lieves that the infermation which he initially furnished the CIA
was sufficient te have located some records pertaining to hin, he
is providing the following additional information in hopes that the
CZa will now be able te locate responsive records.

My. Keenan states that on or abont June 1981, he completed a
series of CIA application forms for employment. At. chat tine, bea
resided in the 1600 block of. connecticut Avenue, ¥- NW. ‘Keenan
was encouraged to submit these applications by tuo cra an women en~
Ployees whe resided at the same location.

After Keenan completed these applications, he was interviewed
at length as a prospective CIA employee. At the conclusion o
interviews, Keenan and the CIA officar who conducted the in
were unable to reach agreement on a starting Salary, as the CIA’s
offer was too lew for Keenan. Bagad on the CIA's “Interest ‘in
Keenan as a prospective employee, it is clear that at a minimum, it
should have a 201, file an Keenan.

For six years Keenan was an FBI Supervisor. For six and a
half years he was Foreign Assistance Inspecter in southeast Asia.
During these periods he had frequent contact with CIA represent2—
tives in investigative matters of mutual interest. Because of
this, there should be numerous references to Feenan in CLA files..

    

 

As an FBI supervisor,. Keenan played a Fole in the FBI‘s inves-
tigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This
ig evidenced by the following decuments:
