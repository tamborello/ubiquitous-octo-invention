Mr. Postal. And were you given access to any of the

 

' intelligence reports coming from the Bureau relative to

organized crime that you felt related to what you were working
on?
Mr. Sheridan. Yeah. If there was, if there was a need.

In other words, the two areas often intertwined, so if we got

into an area that we were interested in, we would share informa-!

 

tion with them and they would share information with us. ,
Mr. Postal. In the course of your investigation into the i

labor rackets, did you have occasion to do a good deal of”

investigating concerning the mob's activities in Las Vegas?
Mr. Sheridan. “Not really.

were the pension fund loans by the Teamsters Pension Fund to

Las Vegas casinos, and to that extent, there was a mutual

Mr. Postal. Well, as I understand it, there were two

Mr. Postal. But as I understand, they were fairly closely

i Mr. Sheridan. Yeah.

Mr. Postal. So in your activities in Las Vegas you

   

must have come into contact with the names again.of Giancana

and Roselli and the other group that was in Las Vegas as opposed |

to the Cleveland group with Moe Dalitz and some of the other

mobsters?

    
    
  
 
  
 
 
 

| Mr. Sheridan. With Dalitz, yes, because Dalitz and his

group were in the Stardust, and the Desert Inn, and they both

 

 

had received pension fund loans.

The people like Giancana and the others, the Mafia people
like from Chicago were not involved in any of these loans, and
I don't recall, therefore, any direct involvement on our part
with those people os

Mr. Postal. Uh-huh.

Mr. Sheridan. You see, Dalitz was up front, and it is
kind of a unique situation because what you are talking about
is the Cleveland group who moved from Cleveland to Las Vegas,
and in the process acquired some degree of respectability, and

they owned the casinos, and they were on record, and they were

out front.

the relationship of the Teamsters with the rackets, is that
correct?

Mr. Sheridan. Yeah.

Mr. Postal. And one of the areas that came under scrutiny
was the Chicago area, is that correct?

Mr. Sheridan. Yeah.

Mr. Postal. And in that light, the same Sam Giancana
probably became known to you.

Mr. Sheridan. Sure.

Mr. Postal. And do you recall that one of the first things
the Attorney General did when he became Attorney General was
to target for the Bureau and the other investigative agencies
of the government certain figures in organized crime that he
Wanted investigated vigorously?

Mr. Sheridan. Well, I think what he did was to first of
lall beef up the organized crime section. He certainly indicated] -
he wanted the organized crime section to pursue more vigorously

the whole problem of organized crime. In that process, cefttain

organized crime figures were, if you want to use the word,
