racist, or nationalistic organization.

subjects belonged and the number that belonged in each. Since many times

one individual was a member of several organizations, a further break down

to obtain this type of information. Thus, it becomes important to establish
whether or not the Secret Service had close contact with other government
agencies, to the point that referrals were made as regarded threatening in-
dividuals. The first agency studied closely was the F.B.I. It was determined
that in 413 cases, 75 were definitely referred to the Secret Service by the
Bureau. Out of those 75, 59 were referred subsequent to JFK's assassination.
Only sixteen cases had been referred to the Service prior to the Dallas motor-
cade. (See Appendix A and B). The following is a chart to show the case
numbers of the individuals referred prior as opposed to those given following

Kennedy's death.

Document No. 008894 (complete survey of the 413 Protective Research cases
established by the Secret Service from March - December, 1963).

Other agencies were also responsible for giving the Secret Service leads
on potentially dangerous individuals. The Armed Services referred four Pro-
tective Research cases: Army - Case # 103 and # 280; Navy - Case # 125 and
# 130. Other agencies in contact with the Secret Service included: Treasury
(the Department controling the U.S.S.S.), VA hospitals, the National Bureau
of Standards, the Washington D.C. hospital, the Soviet embassy in Washington,
the Veteran's Administration, the Postal Authority in Dallas, the Bureau of

Customs in Philadelphia, the Department of Commerce, N.S.A., Social Security,

the CIA (which referred Case #401 involving a Panamanian plot against JFK).

Local police departments in areas Kennedy had trips scheduled were
also active in making referrals. A list of 13 such individual cases follows:

One point of conflict in the statistics given above and a memo dated
3/31/64 from J. Edgar Hoover to Rankin concerns information fed the Miami
Secret Service and the Dallas Secret Service field offices in 1963. Hoover
states that Dallas was given the name Norman Lee Elkins” A review of the 413
files shows no Elkins mentioned. The question must be raised as to the ac-
curacy of Hoover's stapment or to the standards set by the Secret Service to
begin a file on a potentially threatening individual. Since the Secret Service
procedure called for each field office to inform Headquarters and the Protec-
tive Research Section every time a subject case file was opened, this informa-
tion should have reached PRS, where all files were centralized.

To: Dick Billings
From: Eileen Dinneen
Date: October 19, 1978
Re: Draft due November 1, 1978 - Secret Service Protective Cases

A complete review of all protective cases established by the Secret
Service during the time period covered from March, 1963 through December,
1963 was undertaken to determine what type of individuals necessitated the
opening of a case file, what criteria was used in deciding whether or not
the person constituted a threat, and to evaluate how the Service handled
threatening individuals. Of the 413 total cases reviewed, it was established
that there were seven major categories that resulted in the Secret Service
opening case files on individuals. Six areas involved immediate threat poten-
tial; the seventh area, miscellaneous, is a catch all category for subjects
coming to the attention of the Secret Service and not posing an immediate
threat but of possible future interest. The seven major sources identified
area: 1) Puerto Rican dissidents, 2) black militants, 3) right wing extremists,
4) left wing extremists, 5) Cuban revolutionaries, 6) dangerous mental cases/
alcoholics, and 7) miscellaneous - job seekers, obscene letter writers, White
House visitors, etc. A fine line exists between the latter two categories, -
as many White House visitors, letters writers, etc. were deemed to be mental
cases after interviews and/or diagnosis by a doctor. A further breakdown of

the last categories exists in Appendix C.

A. LIAISON

Before reviewing each individual threat, however, the question of re-
ferral and liaison must be raised. The Secret. Service was not and still is
not an investigative agency. The Service relies on other agencies for infor-
mation regarding dissidents, criminals, and mental patients. Only when an

individual expresses interest in a protectee does the Secret Service become
