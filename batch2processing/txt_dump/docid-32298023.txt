SA F. X. Jahn, senior Resident Agent, Hyattsvillé, Maryland, 4. ~.
called at 12:30 p.m., 8/2/58; to advise that he was preparing a teletype to
the Bureau concerning a possible conspiracy to violate the Netrality Act and
other Federal statutes which was brought to his attention by BA 1154-C this
morning.

The informant told of being approached by three men at 9:50 a.m.
today who broached the idea of his obtaining a large amount of arms and
ammunition by stealth or by means of bribery from the warehouse of the
Interarms Company, a munitions dealer in Alexandria, Virginia. The three
men told he-informant they were returning to Miami by plane and that he
should reath them there by telephone on Sunday or Monday at the latest to
advise-6f progress he was making in obtaining these arms.

One of these individuals was known to informant as Al Dobek or

_ Dobeck informant was not sure how name was spelled.\ He described. Dobek
“ds’a seedy character who will.do anything for a buck. -Dobek told informant
that he was’ now employed.as a security officer at the DeauvilleHotel, Miami,
Florida, and was acting as a go-between for his two companions whom he
introduced as’ Ed Browder and "Reds."

Inasmuch as this appeared to be primarily a netrality matter and
since there had been no violation of any statute within the supervision of this
division, the facts were furnished to SA J. G. Short, who was on duty in
Mr. Belmont's Office. SA Jahn advised that the purpose of his call was. to
enable the Bureau to begin checking on Dobek in advance so that appropriate
action could be taken in this matter without delay.
