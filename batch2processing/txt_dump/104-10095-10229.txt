Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. Loverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in 1947 until

 

 

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile surveillance team and a

mail intercept operation.

 

Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by

 

 

 

 

 

 

who was handled by a Station case officer. The number

 

of lines tapped was limited only by the availability of a listening post
nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handied by a Station case officer
assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

ue

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis. in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

_ tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was -

oo baing released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo- .

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in the middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the front gate of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third Photographic site, was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed ‘by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent. oo

Russian or another language besides Scanish or English went out of the listening
post the day after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel)was

typed. These reels were taken to another location where they were translated
and typed. In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran
about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of

_ Russian conversations among the wembers of the Soviet Embassy. During this
period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station
and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may
have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the
Soviet line. It was picked uy and taken to Boris for a translation because
the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to
compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of
transcripts ever made in languages other than Spanish or English because Win
Scott could read only those two languages end he versonally screened the

transcripts for operational leads he wanted pursued.
