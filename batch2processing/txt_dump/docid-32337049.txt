SIRAB No. 150” o Ko gust 1959
WESTERN HEMISPHERE
7. Opposition to Fidel Castro Regime Growing

CAF IN 70482 Information received from various

31 July 1959 independent sources in Cuba during
AFCIN-2A5 . the past several days indicates the.
—SECGRETNOEORN : existence of an active conspiracy

which hopes to overthrow the Cuban
regime in the near future. The con-
spiracy is, said to include the assassination of Prime Minister Fidel
Castro and“his brother Raul, the revolt of a portion of the Cuban
Armed Forces, and a coordinated invasion of armed forces from the
Dominican Republic,
. According to the report, the key factor in the current con-
spiracy is Major Williara Alexander Morgan, an American soldier
of fortune who fought against the Batista regime during the recent
revolution. Morgan has reportedly agreed to defect, taking with
him 4,000 members of the Armed Forces, who are mainly former
members of the second’national front of Esacambray. Further-
more, Morgan reportedly claimed that a number of officers of the
Cuban Army, including a few of major rank, are with him in the
conspiracy. *

ACS/I Comment: While it is
possible that an , attempt to overthrow the Castro government by
armed force will be tried soon, it seems almost certain that it would
fail, If Fidel Castro and his brother were assassinated, however,
an opposition group might successfully take power in the resultant
chaos, At the same time, an opportunity would be created for the
Communists to enhance their position,

Although Trujillo is known to be supporting Cuban irregulars
in the Dominican Republic and elsewhere, it is highly unlikely that. ~
he would support a military adventure against Cuba prior to the a
convening of the American Foreign Ministers in Chile on 12 Augus

 

Meanwhile, the Castro government continues to have the
ardent support of a considerable majority of the Cuban people.
Discontent has increased, but there is no evidence that it ex-
tends to actual participation or approval of conspiracies against
the regime.
