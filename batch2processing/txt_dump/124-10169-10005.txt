‘fconsu,TED BY MEXICANS, SCOTT SAID
CONVINCED ALVARADO'S STORY WAS FABRICATION
ENTIRE MATTER OF ALVARADO'S ADMISSION TO FABRICATION WAS

FULLY DISCUSSED WITH AMBASSADOR MANN IN LENGTHY SESSION, HE

ACCEPTS FACT THAT STORY WAS FABRICATION BUT CONTINUES TO FEEL

CASTRO MAY HAVE BEEN BEHIND KENNEDY ASSASSINATION. (THIS OPINION

IN PART BASED ON TWO PHONE CALLS WHICH OCCURRED BETWEEN PRESIDENT

DORTICOS OF CUBA AND CUBAN AMBASSADOR HERE ON NOVEMBER 26 LAST

IN WHICH DORTICOS REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED AMBASSADOR WITH REGARD

TO WHETHER SILVIA DURAN HAD BEEN INTERROGATED ABOUT MONEY WHEN

SHE WAS ARRESTED BY MEXICAN AUTHORITIES NOVEMBER 23 LAST. 4X GX MW
AMBASSADOR MANN WAS MOST EFFUSIVE IN HIS COMMENTS CONCERNING

DIRECTOR'S COOPERATION IN HAVING SENT KEENAN HERE AND REQUESTED

THAT KEENAN CONVEY PERSONALLY HIS APPRECIATION TO DIRECTOR, HE

STATED HE FEELS THAT WITH ALVARADO'S ADMISSION OF FABRICATION

THERE WOULD APPEAR TO BE NO REASON FOR KEENAN TO REMAIN HERE

ANY LONGER, KEENAN HAS RESERVATIONS TO DEPART MEXICO CITY AT

11 PM TODAY ON EASTERN FLIGHT 304% WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE

AT DULLES AIRPORT IN WASHINGTON AT 6 AM TOMORROW. a()
