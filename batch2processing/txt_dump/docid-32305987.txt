RO “J Willian E. Foley, Acting Assistant Attorney General WEF :PW:
Criminal Division

SUBJECT: FBI reports submitted in connection with case of

we United States v. Bonanno, Tos apy
y ee ese

The Special Assistant to the Attorney General in
~charge of the prosecution of the subject case has called our
“2 ‘Sattention to the fact that many of the FBI reports received
<Bince the return of the indictment in this case have reflected
ae interviews conducted by Agents a year or more before the date
of ‘the typed reports. For example a report will be furnished
of an interview of witness Jones in March 1958, but the report
willibe dated June 1959.

 

. : It is anticipated that when these witnesses testify

s atithe Trial a demand will be made pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3500
for the production of statements by the witness in the possession
of the Government. The reports of interviews are probably not
subject to production under the statute and production thereof
will be opposed by Government Counsel. The fact remains, however,.
that under the statute the reports can be, and in all probability
‘will be, examined by the trial judge in camera.

' We must anticipate that in the event of such inspection
the Court will require some explanation for the interval between
‘ the date of the interview and the date of the report.

  
  
   
   
  
   

There are at least two possible explanations:

iN 1. That the 1959 reports were made from notes not
4 previously transcribed.
¥ . \%
a 2. That the 1959 reports were taken from earlier
Q reports which covered more than the single
maN interview and that defendants are éntitled only (
He to the full text Branterview of the witness’ i
involved. EF Nn
Sy 986 - X95 7 Ym RAND 3
eal Sho 3 eft ps In view of this you are requested to advise us as i
QS s to the explanation for the time lapse noted above iin order '
® ~ that Government Counsel can supply it -to ‘the Court 4 if required |
~ > .» to do so.
