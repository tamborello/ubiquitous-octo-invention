“FI/OPS recommends strongly that the photo coverage be reviewed from the’
standpoint of value and usefulness with a view to determinging whether

photographic coverage conducted on a more selective basis, without materially
affecting overall usefulness."

“While HMMAY4093 (not located) correctly referred to LIMITED,LILYRIC and

CLICALLAJas 'photographi basehouses,' the Station would like to emphasize
that photographic coverage is only one of their functions (please see

(_HMMAS12095, 4 February 1959){ LIMITED }is used as a radio dispatch base for
automobile surveillance teams in addition to physical surveillance of ‘
persons entering the front gate. Their photography is negligible compared
to. their other duties. The LILYRIC base performs the best photography of
persons visiting the front gate, perhaps because the vantage point for
taking the pictures is from the second floor and above the street traffic
which partially blocks LIMITED photographs.{ LILYRICJalso does individual
reports it LIMERICK personnel entering and leaving the main gate. ."

"The Station feels that it would be helpful to summarize at this time
information previously reported to Headquarters (see paragraph 3, reference
B) concerning the photo basehouses under this project and thereby give
Headquarters an updated frame of reference in which to view the roles of the
various basehouses. : :

Thi LIMITED and LILYRIC BASEHOUSES provide coverage of front of the

( HiiWA323343, 4/30/64, says, in para. 2:

. ¢ LIMERICK)instal lation. Although on the surface it may appear that these

two basehouses. provide duplicate take, this is not the case. It has been the
Station's experience in running the unilateral LIEMPTY operation that a 0900
. to evening workday, which would be required of a single basehouse in order to
cover the{ LIMERICKJtarget effectively, is just too long for any pair of
agents to remain effective. This is especially true when it is considered
‘that these basehouse operators are essentially unsupervised during their
workday. It would also be impossible for a single base-house to provide
the kind of coverage the station needs on the target installation,
especially during the peak hours of activity, namely late morning and early
afternoon. For these reasons, the€LILYRIC %basehouse generally operates
from 0900 to 1400°-or 1500 weekdays. LLIMITEDJoperates from 1200 to 1800 or
dark (as the daily situation dictates) on weekdays, and 0900 to 1400 on
Saturdays. (These hours are subject to change to fit Station néeds.)
Special coverage for Sunday is arranged on a need basis; however, past
experience has shown regular coverage of Saturday afternoons and Sundays
is not rewarding. This schedule provides for both basehouses to be in
action during the peak activity hours of the€CLIMERICKtarget. Although even
this arrangement is not completely airtight, anything less than this would
present unacceptable gaps in the coverage. It must also be considered that
without two basehouses covering the front of the target installation, any
illness, personal problem or vacation for operators of one basehouse
would terminate Station coverage....It is the Station's opinion that as
Tong as the€LIMERICKTInstallation is a prime target of the Station, it will
be necessary to maintain the present three basehouses. To eliminate any one
of the trhee would create a gap in the Station's coverage that would not be
compatible with the emphasis placed on this target.

SUMMARY OF FILE REVIEW COND'CTED AT CIA HEADQUARTERS ON 31 OCTOBER 1978.

Response dated 20 August 1978.
"SUBJECT: Response to HSCA Request of 25 July 1978.

og 1. A thorough review of Agency files containing production from th¢ LILYRIC 7
3 photographic surveillance operation in Mexico City reveals the existence of
; nd LILYRIC logs or production earlier than 3 April 1967. It appears that
earlier photographs may have been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station
files and that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters for retention.

2. According to a blind memorand 2_May 1977, subject: Review of
Mexico City Station Files at ind Records Center, thefLILYRIC| ‘1
folder which would have contained photographs and logs for the period

23 July through 30 November 1963 had been. re-used to store LICALLA photo-
graphs and logs for the period 2 May through 30 June 1967. (cf. Blind
memorandum dated 5 May 1977, subject: Photograph Records of the “uniden-
tified Man" who Was in Mexico City during October 1963.)

3. The above information is contained in a soft file entitled: Photograph of
Unidentified Individual in Mexico City. This folder has been reviewed by
the following HSCA staff members: :

.13 March 1978 - Dan Hardway

10 April 1978 - Michael Goldsmith
; “Rober Genzman

 

4 May 1978 - Edwin Lopez.

DIR 28778 to which MEXI 9440 is referrenced is itself referenced to
DIR 22051 with the slug{"TYPIC AMMUS" 7) says:

"Re ref negatives please advise date and pouch number first batch forwarded
HQs.

SA Comment HQS wishes to print photos and requeste d MEXI forward negatives

Review of Soviet Logs: from Log Film 143.

The coverage for 27 September is given as 900 to 1900 but the last sequence of
paotographs was taken at 1146.

This does not appear to be too unusaual. on 9/25 the coverage is the same

and the last photos taken at 1137. See following chart.

Reply to 7/20 request regarding CIA-FBI coordination:

31 July 1978
Memo for Breckinridge
from Shepanek

1. The answer to paragraph 2 of reference is that there are not now, nor
were there any, agreements between the CIA and FBI or other U.S. govern-
ment agencies concerning CIA responsibility to report on contacts fo

U.S. citizens with Communist Embassies or officials. Such reporting would
be expressly forbidden by current legislation.

2. The CIA under operative legislation has a counterintelligence respon-
sibility for counterintelligence cases but this is not a matter of
agreement with other agencies nor does it concern simp] contacts of
Americans abroad with Communist Embassies or officials.
