The general opinion among Cuban exiles is that the United States
will not encourage exile groups to mount a major assault on Cubs
until after the United States elections.

The United States, the exiles say, is providing a steady flow of
aid to the Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Move-
ment for Revolutionary Recovery), which is led by Manuel Artime
Buesa. Some exiles claim that the attack by the MRR on Puerto.

Pilon in May 1964 was launched from the Deminican Republic. The:

is no evidence that Artime is receiving support from the Venezu
Government. His failure to establish personal contact with the

Administration (Venezuelan) during his visit to Caracas between
22-27 May 1964 has provoked criticism in government circles. Some

disillusionment with the MRR is said to be caused by Artime's
failure to establish himself as the undisputed leader of the
militant exile forces.

Former Cuban President Carlos Prio Socarras is said to be giving
financial support to Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, paramilitary leader of +

 

the Alliance of the Segundo Frente Nacionai’del Escambray (SFNE,
Second National Front of the Escambray), the Movimiento Revolu-~
cionario del Pueblo (MRP, Revolutionary Movement of the People),
and Alpha-66. The purpose of the subsidy is to prevent the
Alliance from forming close political or operational ties with

JURE. According to Cuban exiles in Miami, JURE is politically ts

the left of all other Cuban exile parties. Some exiles claim
that several Communists, acting as agents for the Castro x
have succeeded in infiltrating JURE.
