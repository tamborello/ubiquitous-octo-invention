MM T-1 advised*h ih constant contact with
ALIEGRO, who seems to be one of the most important leaders

. of the movement . ALIEGRO is very wealthy and formerly

was Prime Minister of Cuba under BATISTA. He recently
"donated" $27,000 to ROLANDO MASFERER. This was done
out of fear that if he did not, MA FERRER ‘would retaliate
against him at some later date. ( :

 

ALIEGRO has a plan to ‘bomb Havana with two
Vampire Jet Airplanes. The plan has to have approval
of General PEDRAZA, who has been notified of it, but
who has not as yet sent the money to carry it out. xu)

: ALIEGRO recently had a meeting at his house
attended by wealthy Cuban Nationals residing in Miami.

This meeting appeared to be for the, purpose of getting
them to donate money for the anti-CASTRO cause. It is
not known if they contributed. u)

ALIEGRO is in contact with all anti-CASTRO
groups in Miami and has attempted to obtain some sort
of unity agreement with them; however, this has not been
successful. ¥' w)

One of ALIEGRO's sources ascertained an assassination
plan against unidentified BATISTIANOS in Miami. Source
wanted to go into some complicated counter-plan. ALIEGRO
handled the matter simply by notifying the authorities
and forewarning the BATISTIANOS 4 (u uu)

MARIANO FAGET (protect), advised DIAZ was
formerly an anti-Communist writer in Cuba and at. times -
resorted to receiving money from people for not publishing
‘newspaper articles accusing them of being Communists. gz (w~

He was a leading member of CRAC and made a number
of trips to South America to collect money for CRAC's
anti-CASTRO activity. He kept this money for his own
use. He received an $8,000 radio transmitter from the
Dominican Republic Consul General in Miami and converted
‘it to his own use. This transmitter was given with the
understanding that CRAC would broadcast propaganda to
Cuba. DIAZ VERSON has been expelled from CRAC. Zw

(FAGET is ihe former Chief of BRAC, and has known
‘pIAZ for 25 years.) & w .

 

  

WILLIAM ALEXANDER MORGAN, Major, Cuban Revolutionary
Army, advised on August 20, 1959, that Dominican Republic
Consul General FERRANDO, «gave him over $400,000 to start
a revolution in Cuba. FERRANDO's bank account reflects he
gave a Miami policeman, JOSEPH LIQUORI, two checks for
the amount of $45,000 for an unknown purpose. FERRANDO
wag indicted by a Federal Grand Jury, Miami, on June
4, 1959, for conspiring to illegally ship arms and bribery
of a Customs Agent.

FERRANDO is in contact with anti-CASTRO revolutionists
in Miami and is now considered by some Cubans to be the next
to be purged by TRUJILLO for failure of the MORGAN episode.

MASFERRER feels that the August 8 to 14, 1959 aborted

uprising in Cuba, although a failure, enhanced his
reputation and prestige. because he opposed any invasion
from the Dominican’ Republic. ;

MASFERRER, through regular liaison and courder
system, is in contact with leaders in the Dominican
Republic and Miami. -He was offered a base to operate
from in Guatemala and arms from Panama. JAFFE will leave
in the near future for Guatemala concerning setting up
a base for MASFERRER in that country.

; MASFERRER is considered important to General
PEDRAZA and other leaders because he reportedly has between
two to three thousand men in Oriente Province of Cuba
and two or three hundred in Havana Province. These persons
reportedly will respond to MASFERRER and will-revoit against
the CASTRO government whenever MASFERRER so orders it.

General BENITEZ advised that on August 8, 1959,
a meeting was held at MASFERRER's residence where about
300 anti-CASTRO Cuban Nationals attended. Between 30 to
40° were former Cuban Army officers. All were alerted for a
possible expedition to leave the United States for eventual
armed invasion of Cuba. ‘

When it was ascertained that the August 8, 1959
uprising in Cuba was unsuccessful, a shadow of gloom was
cast on the movement in Miami; however, the movement soon

‘recovered and claimed that the unsuccessful uprising did

not change any plans, but only postponed them.

(JAFFE, an American, is a close associate of
MASFERRER.)

Cuban government.

sent from the Dominican Republic to Trinidad, Cuba, and
