CONTACT WITH NATHALIE. LILLY ON OCTOBER 12, 1954

On October 12, 1954, NATHALIE LILLY. was contacted by
SAs BILL WILLIAMS. and.ROBERT. J. KIRWAN to secure additional
information. regarding her background. She advised that she is
presently Corresponding Secretary of the Plainfield Chapter

of the NAACP, but that she knows of no Communist infiltration.

She advised that she has seen LENORE KANTOR two times since
September 20, 1954, having seen her on October 12, 1954. She
said that just prior to the contact by the Agents on October 12,
195), LENORE had brought. a letter to her, which letter protested
against Universal Military Training. LENORE wanted her to

send the letter to the Editor of the Plainfield newspaper with
NATHALIE's name. as the author. NATHALIE told LENORE that she
would think it over. NATHALIE. advised that she does not think
she will send the letter to the editor as it might jeopardize
her position.

The Agents were impressed. with NATHALIE's intelligence,
cooperation, and viewpoint, and feel that she is in a good
position to furnish information of interest to the Bureau,
especially regarding LENORE KANTOR. It is also felt that she
may be activated into, the CP or a Communist front organization.

Authority is requested to contact NATHALIE LILLY
as a PSI. It is not believed that ALFRED LILLY is in a
position to furnish information, inasmuch as LENORE KANTOR-
does not get along with him too well.

Communist. activities. NATHALIE..also knows of the KANTOR
family. NATHALIE.furnished the following information regarding
KANTOR: | Lo.

LENORE KANTOR's family are well aware that LENORE is

a Gommunist., and they are bitterly against Communism but their
love for LENORE keeps them from making. her léave home. They -
‘often speak of how bad it is that NORE, thinks, J’ she does,

OR. MARVIN is partially paralysed and NC MAN™“once ran ‘for
“Plainfield City Council. LENORE was in love with a man who |
lives in Mexico, but a girl from ‘the New York-New Jersey area
was going to marry him, names unknown. LENORE spends much of
her time distributing the literature and booklets described
by ALFRED LILLY. In the Fall of 1953, Mrs. LILLY told LENORE
that she. (Mrs. LILLY) was going to. Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for
a visit. LENORE gave her §s0. 00 and told her to stop at
Chicago, Illinois, and attend a conference. of the National
Negro Congress, which was being held there. Mrs. LILLY
registered at the conference but did not stay for the meetings.
Apparently, LENORE seems to have all the money she needs.

 
         
    

The Bureau's jurisdiction in Internal Security matters
was explained to the LILLYs. Mrs. LILLY said that she
would continue friendly. relations with LENORE and would see
if she could determine any of LENORE's activities in the field
of Communism, and would advise the Newark Office.

It is noted that LENORE KANTOR.is the subject of an
SM-C investigation in the Newark Office, Bureau file 100~367098,
Newark file 1000-31013. KANTOR's file reflects that she was
a member of the CP as late as 1950, at which time the informant
left the Party, and LENORE has been a member of the CP since
about 1945. The file also shows + “she has recently been
in Mexico, where she met wabiuefcLisLy, alleged agent of
