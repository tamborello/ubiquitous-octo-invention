Dear Mr. Gunn:

Re: STATEMENT CONCERNING ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY PURSUANT TO
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE JFK ASSASSINATION
RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992

The following is a-listing of the principal measures
taken to date by the Agency to fulfill the requirements of
the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. (the
Act). Note: it does not include the numerous informal ,
meetings, conversations, and exchanges between ARRB and HRP
staff members, many of which covered all of the measures.

INITIAL SEARCHES

 

a. In early 1992, even before the Act was passéa, the

-Chief of the CIA History Staff reported to the Director that

the staff had located all of the so-called “sequestered
collection” (those records compiled by the Agency for the
House Select Committee On Assassinations investigation) and
had surveyed these and other related holdings on the
assassination both at Headquarters and at the Agency records
center. The sequestered collection contained sixty-four
record center-size boxes. In addition, the staff had
located sixteen boxes of Lee Oswald's 201 file and a number
of loose folders mainly from Mexico Station records that
were collected for the Warren Commission.

b. Before the ARRB was appointed by the President,

John Pereira, Chief, Historical Review Group/Center for the
Study of Intelligence, sent a memorandum dated 25 October
1993 to the Agency directorates requesting a name search on
Lee Harvey Oswald, the JFK assassination, and any documents
related to the assassination. This effort and discussions
with various Agency components and Agency Information
Release Officers over the past four years resulted in more

than 31 additional boxes of materials being sent for review.
Included within this material were 19 boxes of JFK working
files based on the sequestered collection, two boxes on
Nosenko, seven boxes of LA Division documents and three
boxes from the Bay of Pigs period. Not all of this material
is related to the JFK story; and in some boxes only a few
folders had anything to do with the assassination or events
surrounding it. To date, the ARRB staff has designated
approximately 22 boxes of this material as assassination
records. In addition, about 400 pages of material from an
FOIA request for minutes of the DCI’s morning meetings which
related to JFK were added to the collection. The search for
documents is a continuing effort. Guidelines for this
effort have been sent to Agency individuais and components
which review documents’ and materials in the course of their
work.

REVIEWS

c. Historical Review Group, now the Historical Review
Program, reviewed boxes 1 through 63 of the sequestered

.collection and the Oswald 201 file and released most of the

documents therein either in full or in sanitized form to the
National Archives in August 1993. The total number of pages
released by CIA prior to or during August 1993 was
approximately 123,000. An additional release of hi
approximately 30,000 pages of HSCA material from the
sequestered collection was made in 1995.

dad. Box 64 of the sequestered collection contained 72
reels of microfilm primarily dealing with Directorate of
Operations materials and Office of Security files. In
addition there were 22 reels of 201 files on 151
‘individuals. Following release of the main collection in
August 1993, HRG staff members reviewed the microfilm files
and released approximately 74,000 pages of material to the
National Archives either in full or in sanitized form.

e. The status of HRP’s review of additional records
and re-review of the sequestered collection will be
addressed in regular progress reports to the ARRB staff.

 

REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL RECORDS AND. INFORMATION

£. The Agency maintains a rather unique and non-
integrated files system which precludes a single query on a
particular subject and the expected response from the files

of all directorates. Following coordination with the ARRB
staff, the Agency arranged for the staff to be briefed by a
representative of each directorate concerning the nature of
the files within the directorate -- how they are organized,
maintained, searched, and how they have been searched
previously for assassination-related materials. Following ©
this effort, the ARRB staff asked for a number of additional
searches by the Agency and they are in various stages of
completion. :

g. In addition, pursuant to requests both formal and
informal from.the ARRB staff, HRP has tasked various
elements of the Agency to conduct special searches for other

.materials thought to be relevant to the assassination story.

Included in this category was the Oswald security file which
was found and has been examined by the ARRB staff. Although
a number of the requests are still outstanding, considerable
material has been provided for review by the ARRB staff some
of which has been found to be relevant. These materials
include the History Staff's histories on various CIA
operations and Agency components; files on specific
individuals involved in either the Warren Commission or HSCA
investigations; and the product of CIA internal, reviews of
programs and operations. Those parts of these materials _
which are determined by the ARRB staff to have relevancy to
the assassination story will be reviewed by HRP and}
released as completed. .

The status, results, and documentation of specific
requests are to be addressed in a separate memorandum.

Sincerely,

| fo \

JFK Project Officer
