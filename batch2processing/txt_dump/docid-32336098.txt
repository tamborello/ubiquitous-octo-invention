DIRECTOR, FBI (62-9-29)
SAC, MIAMI (92-515)

SUBJECT: “CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM.
“MIAMI-DIVISTONC

WEEKLY SUMMARY

MM 822-C advised that MAX EDER (MM 92-467) appears
to have acquired more control over activities at the
Fontainebleau Hotel, evidenced by the fact that executives
from all departments of the hotel have been consulting more
and more with EDER on policy, etc. EDER now has ORAM, LLL,

-an employee of the baggage room of the Fontainebleatt Hotel
handling all of the em loyees', bets, which SMITH delivers,
with the money to Bapetieraan > a bookmaker for EDER. EDER
also assigned BEN SH. AN to operate in the cabana of the
hotel, rather than the card room, as EDER is attempting to
avoid paying the law enforcement agencies. Reportedly, EDER
then can report that there has been no activity in the card
room and hence there is no need to make any payoff.

mM 814-c reported that MIKE MC LANEY (MM 92-464)
had owed the Fontainebleau Hotel between $8,000 and $9,000
for three or four years, and recently paid it. He also
reportedithat MC LANEY acquired the transportation desk at
the Fontainebleau Hotel for $10,000 a year. He advised in
addition that although MC LANEY and BE OVACK, operator ; fut?
of the hotel, have been good friends for years, they are at
odds at present because the transportation desk, in NOVACK's
opinion, has been doing very poorly.
