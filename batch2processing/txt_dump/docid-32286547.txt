as such, one may have turned sour and resulted in
MATHEWS ordering JAMES' death.

Informant advised that JAMES has been thought
of as being a "snitch" for some time, but informant
advised he has heard of no one who believed this story
strong enough to kill JAMES.

Informant stated that his information is that
the money from the doctor confidence job in New Orleans,
Louisiana, was all returned following JAMES getting some
pressure from the New Orleans La Cosa Nostra.

On January 14, 1970, informant telephonically
advised SA PARKER he had just returned from JAMES '
fure ral in Gulfport, Mississippi.

Informant stated that the "job" does not now
appear to have been perpetrated by CLIFFORD FULLER.
Informant advised that the men from the lounge where
JAMES was killed have aroused the informant's suspicion.
He stated that the two bartenders were at JAMES's
residence too often bringing food and offering
sympathies. He stated that since none of the group
knew these individuals, it seemed very strange.

Informant advised he went to the club where
JAMES was killed and while questioning these men, they
continued to contradict their own storées as to the
times and sequence of the events on the night of the
shooting.

Informant stated that CAROLY NORRIS JAMES
took him into the bedroom and swore to the informant

‘that every penny of the money in the New Orleans

swindle of the doctors had been returned by JAMES.

Informant advised that after looking over
the situation and talking toJAMES' wife, he feels that
the best "guess estimate" is that a man named BLACKWELL
and JAMES were having bad feelings over who was going
to operate the gambling which was beginning to open
up on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Source advised that
he is of the opinion BLACKWELL is a good suspect.

Informant advised that he is of the opinion
that the bartenders at the club where JAMES was killed
have much more information regarding the killing than
they have provided so far.

The BLACKWELL mentioned above is JAMES RUFE
BLACKWELL, a hoodlum who has been on the Mississippi
Gulf Coast for a number of years. On June 15, 1968,
there was a shooting at the JAMES residence but there
were no injuries. BLACKWELL was thought to be involved
in that shooting. .

The Atlanta Office furnished the following
information on January 20, 1970, in Jackson case
captioned "DONALD LESTER JANES, aka;: AR":

On the evening of January 12,°1970, Pci[__—|

advised SA DONALD P, BURGESS that JIMMIE
JAMES had been killed early that morning in Biloxi,
Mississippi. Informant advised that JAMES had been

shot as heemerged froma nightclub.

Informant advised that it would be difficult
to speculate as to who might have shot JAMES because
he had a great number of enemies. Informant stated,

NO 92-1029

CLYDE BOURGEOIS6on 12/4/69, stating that he has physically
assaulted JUNIOR PROVENZANO by hitting him over the head
with a chair. BOURGEOIS explained that the reason he
attacked PROVENZANO in a bar in Marrero, La., was that he
suspected PROVENZANO had burglarized his home, stealing some
$4,000 worth of guns.

On 1/8/70 NO 1283-PC advised SA THOMAS L. COLARELLI
and SA HAROLD V. HUGHES that he had not seen ELDON LEGAN
recently, but would attempt to ascertain his whereabouts.

On 1/27/70 this source advised the above Agents
that he had still not determined LEGAN's current whereabouts,
put would contact NELLO PACINI, close associate of both LEGAN
and PROVENZANO, in an attempt to do so. Re the JAMES killing,
he offered the opinion that a good suspect would be PEXRY COOK
HENRY COOK SALISBURY, who has had a grudge against JAMES for
several years and is quite capable of killing him.

On 12/31/69 JK 358-C advised he observed
DONALD LESTER JAMES at CHUCK CLARY's Bay View Supper Club
in Ft. Walton Beach, Fla., and heard a conversation in
which JAMES remarked that he was staying at the Howard Johnson
Motel.

On 1/29/70 NO 1793-PC advised SA THOMAS L. COLARELLI
‘that JOE ODDO is back in the 4th St. area of Marrero, La., and
is frequenting Dano's Drive-In, and has been seen in the company
of JUNIOR PROVENZANO. Source advised that he was talking to
TINY BARNES, who is running the Royal Motel in Marrero, and
BARNES seemed to know all about the JAMES killing, and could
probably offer some suspects if he chose to talk, because he
knows the whole crowd.

Source advised that PROVENZANO is dividing his time
between the horse stable during the day arid Dano's at night.

PcI| [ewrniohed the following
information to . R on January 13, 1970:
Informant advised he had been in telephonic
contact with CAROLYN NORRIS JAMES, and she wanted him
to come to the funeral of her husband but informant
was afraid REX ARMISTEAD, Chief Investigator, Mississippi

Highway Safety Patrol, Jackson, Mississippi, would have
him arrested before he reached Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

Informant advised that without knowing the
details of the killing of JAMES, it is hard to determine
who killed him, but the following were his immediate
thoughts: .

1. If the shooting was done by one individual,
probably it was done by CLIFFORD FULLER, who is very
patient and who would wait forever for.a chance to even
the score with DONALD LESTER JAMES over JUDY KAY;

2. I£ the shooting was done by two individuals,
it could have been over the split of the money in the
Covington, Louisiana, gipsy camp "job", which according
to the informant was fingered by JAMES. Informant advised
that BOBBY GALE GWIN and "TOE HEAD" WHITE have already been
killed, and JAMES may have been the next on the list;.

3.. Informant advised that R, D. MATHEWS of
Dallas, Texas, who had GARY MC DANIELS killed, always
uses two or three men to finish people where bad splits
are involved, Informants advised that JAMES and MATHEWS
have been in together on several confidence schemes, and
