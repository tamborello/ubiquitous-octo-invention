something Constructive: This Gill recently, a few years
; or’ less ago Made a trip to the- Soviet Union etc on ‘the

, Youth Conference Know as the ‘World ‘Youth Conference.'

He will probably emerge from the ‘New York thing asa”
full time - “organizer in some special field suchas. -youth.

At the start of the’ Neeting Genne ‘brought out
A her brief case full of clipbiiigs (Newspaper) ete she
; also had a lot of penciled notes which she was —
; undoubtedly going to use to show ‘what she was doing
‘ and to give others: hell for not ‘co-operating with her.

But the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around
the late Pres. Kennedy.

Arnold explained that since Oswald was considered a”
Communist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode
against the C. party of America but by the time’ ‘the
recactionaries were getting started it was announced
that it had been disclosed that it seemed like the
extreme _Bighe had been’ active. This was bore. out

by the declaration of Russia that it was not the

Cc. party that had dome it because Kennedy was a

friend of the Working class but the work of the extreme
right or almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober”
the masses that it was the same caliber of people who
had insulted Stevenson only Weeks before in Dallas,
Texas.

 

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about this
Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he
told them he gets. Lots of letters of enquiry about the
Cc. party and he probably answered it as he does hundreds
of others and even sent him literature if he requested
it. They (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on the air witha ,
statement but he stated to them he would have to dig the®
letter out andsbe:sure before he Made any statement. —
Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson if when he got back, t
New York to look in the files if he had a letter frou &
Wm Pokas, formerly from Bellaire, Ohio, ‘and also ari

asked Johnson to cottpare the letter of Pokey's ‘with -
Oswald's ‘to see if they didn't haye a lot:in ‘Common.
Palmer stated that he thought the statement by the —
Methodist Minister Covered the situation very good
when he stated that the fact that the Murder of Bill
Moore,’ M Edgar Evers’ and others in’ the. south ‘going
by without punishment had set the stage for the —
Assassination of Pres. Kennedy. Everyone readily
agreed,

Arnold Johnson further stated that. no real Marxist:
Could de such a thing. There is mot Much doubt that
since the Soviet Union had expelled him by not
giving him a Citizenship im the Soviet: Union because
they thought him to be am Agent of Fascism, Genne
Meanwhile was Chomping at the bit trying to get her
story told about the N.A.A.C.P, and CORE,

She finally got her Chance to unload.

She stated that about the time of the Civil Rights
March on Washington a few days before she had béen
working with CORE and NAACP the reporter from the
Wheeling paper Intelligencer had Called and wanted
to talk about her. She gave him answers on the
phone and finally hung up on him. from the time
this phone conversation was completed she had been
quoted im the newspaper and exposed as a. Communist

_ party Member, which brought-about her. expglsion from

the N.A.A.C.P., but simce has been restored to |
Membership. Then lately a Man. (Negro) by name of Johnson
head of the local CORE group was indicted for robbing a

bus driver in Steubenville, Ohio.. Genne had got in
touch with R. Gorby as she thought Johnson was being
framed. Gorby found out and told her at this Meeting
that he had did the robbing and was Not being framed.
The best thing to do stated Gorby was to give him |
help but do not put:CORE.and the NAACP’ out. om a Limb
by doing it,
