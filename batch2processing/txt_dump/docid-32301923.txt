Cuban Exile Activities

on January 28, 1960,

reported that responsible Cuban e e groups,in re co City and
the United States, who have supp ed Dr. LIO YES PORTUONDO,
are convinced that General JOS ERIQVPEDRAZA
commands a group of Cuban military exiles in the Dominican
Republic, would not be a wise selection as the military leader
ofthe capes to overthrow the CASTRO government. The PSI

 

further ad ed Zhat these Cuban exile groups believe that
PEDRO LUIS®DIA Z, former Chief of the Gupan Air. Force,
would be a much better military leader. (' AW ;

The PSI also advised that information received from .

sources within Cuba reflected that FIDEL CASTRO had prepared a
decree ordering the United States to vacate the Guantanamo
Naval Base. According to this information, the decree was
originally prepared in late yeh 1959, but had not yet
been signed for issuance. (% ) 28.
The PSI further reported at he had ard reports in

Miami, Florida, of an invasion a pt which allegedly would

be made by supporters of ROLANDOAMASFERRER,! a Cuban exile who

resides i ami. The PSI, stated that MASFERRER, ROBERTO
_APERNANDEZANGIRANDA, NO. OTHMAN, and their associates form a
group which is not regarded in a favorable light by responsible
Cuban exiles or by responsible elements within Cuba. The PSI
stated that from the information available to him in Miami he
doubted very much that MASFERRER would be able to make an
attempt at invading Cuba or, if an attempt were made, that it
would be successful. AUS

Nicaragua

perso advised on January 28 that he had
peice information from within Cuba that ERNESTO "CHE"

“OEK Act 6 (4)

UEVARA has not abandoned his project to utiTize pro-Communist
éarvaguan exiles and-Cuban "volunteers" in an attempt to

invade Nicaragua. This source advised that approximately 400

guerrillas have been trained to make up the invasion force.

The PSI stated he had received no information as to the timing

of such an attempt, but expressed doubt that. it would occur in

the immediate future in view of the concern of the Cuban Govern-

ment over a possible early invasion attempt by Cuban exiles. (4(u)

: will not only benefit Mexico but its sister Latin American
countries who are bound together not only by historical ties
but by the same economic and social conditions and identical
perspectives. In apparent reference to DAVID ALFARO SIQUEIROS, “444i; :
leading PCM figure, he stated that some people, who are ble, Wi!
, to understand national and international politics altho tae
they pound them daily, have been critical of / LOPEZ

trip. During the course of the President's trip ”

SIQUEIROS made a statement to the press wherein he criticized
the President for not accepting a bid to visit Cuba and stated
that President LOPEZ MATEOS was merely laying the ground work
for a subsequent visit by President EISENHOWER. LOMBARDO was
critical of President LOPEZ MATEOS in certain respects,
particularly in connection with the imprisonment of the
railroad strike agitators and PCM and POCM leaders,
