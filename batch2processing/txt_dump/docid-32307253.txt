E ADMINISTRATIVE |
INVESTIGATION IN THE PITTSBURGH DIVISION

Contact with various sources and informants during
the period of January 3, 1968 to February 20, 1968, resulted
in the information that they either did not know subject or
did not kno6w what connection he has with the MANNARINO
group in New Kensington, Pennsylvania. None knew whether
or not he is a member of La Cosa Nostra,

The investigative period reflects investigation
conducted by the New York Division not available at time
referenced Miami report was prepared,

An information copy of instant report is being
furnished Pittsburgh because of subject's close association
with GABRIEL MANNARINO and his periodic yearly visits to
New Kensington, Pennsylvania.
