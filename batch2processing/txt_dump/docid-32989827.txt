Memorandum

:SAC JOHN W. O'ROURKE

 

:SENSTUDY 75

Captioned matter pertains to Bureau's handling
of requests from Senate and House Select Committees to
study governmental operations with respect to intelligence
activities. In connection with the work of these committees,
staff members may seek to interview current and former FBI
employees.

Recently, the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff
has interviewed several former employees, and it is anticipated
that many more such personnel will be contacted.

The FBI has pledged full cooperation with the
Committee, and we wish to assist and facilitate any investiga-
tions undertaken by the Committee with respect to the FBI.
However, we do have an obligation to insure that sensitive
sources and methods and ongoing sensitive investigations are
fully protected.

Should any former employee contact this office
and have any question regarding his obligation not to
divulge information obtained by virtue of his past FBI
employment, he should be instructed to contact Legal
Counsel, FBIHQ, by collect call. Converstions with former
employees must be in keeping with our pledge. It is believed
such a procedure would insure proper protection and also
facilitate the work of the SSC.

The above procedure also applies to current employees
of the FBI. If any current employees is contacted by the
Committee, advise the SAC immediately.
