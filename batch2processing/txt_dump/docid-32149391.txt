did express himself as feeling that the assassination of
President KENNEDY was a great tragedy.

Informant stated that during the course of the visit,
LOWENFELS was busy reading and judging poetry which had been |
mailed to him by individuals from all ever the US. He said
that ‘the name “Markham Award” is not familiar te him, but
he would assume that it probably had some connection with
LOWENFELS judging of poetry sent to him through the mail.

LOWENFELS left his study to care for his wife, LILLIAN LOJENFELG,
@ seml~invalid, he had an opportunity te make a cursory search —
