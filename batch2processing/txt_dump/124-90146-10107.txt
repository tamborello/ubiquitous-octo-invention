WF 1. Forwarded herewith as Attachment is a Xerox copy of a
photostat of a transcript of a telephone conversation between Carlos)
Moore (and his friend Sandy Bethune) and the late Maicolm X, which
took place 8 or 9 February 1965, SUGAR obtained this transcript |
on 4 June from the editor of the West Indian Gazette, (fnu) Manchanda.
SUGAR believes that Manchanda got the photostat from the Ghana High
- Commission office in London, He further believes that the Afro- :
. American unity group in Paris (among whom there is only one member a i
with U..S, citizenship: the. American Negro photographer, John Taytor)
“probably supplied the transcript to the Ghana officials as a means of a i
building their credentials as a bona fide revolutionary or anization, : 3
