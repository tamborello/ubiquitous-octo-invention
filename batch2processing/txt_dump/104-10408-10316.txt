BR “Purging as

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:

- (1) Duplicate material, ie. exact copy(s) of a document.

'

. . (2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for
the opening,

(3) All abstract slips,
(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.

(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch
cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments.

(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
by the Records Officer. .

(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in-a 201 dossier
forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention
in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized
officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret, classification. '~
authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained’
at the desk or the copy of the TS document should be remaved,. reine’

THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-I, 27 October 1966

. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method. for identifying a person of specific in-

terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom | a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated. .

2, THE 201 SYSTEM —

 

 

2 The ‘principal: featutés of ‘the’ 201 ‘system. are: e

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201- 1234567, assigned to each

. individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that

individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 pening form (Form

" 831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, ie. pei- ~~ ,
: sonal il history, current status, and prospects. : . oe

@ “The ‘Master 201 Record: a machine ‘record jenerated | by the opening g of :

a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and

stores the Pertinent information which may later be retrieved! for special listings.

d. Main. Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated.

sonality records, in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whetaer staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two ‘categories of OL
codes for use by components:

(1) general Ol codes (Attachment 4) -

(2) OF codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.

A component may request an OI code be established by eubmitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer. ~ +

 

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned _
‘when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
ata later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.

f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist. s
3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

‘a. General

.The opening of a 201. dossier is the prerogative: of an Operational * com:
ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates
a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional - closing.
of d 201 dossier aré controlled jointly by the desks and.ISG. 201 dossiers-may be -

“ ppened on persons who 1 meet the carding orftéria descrited'in Chapter, If of this ~:

will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on { ;
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per- §
sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those:
persons for whom provisional operational. approvals and operational approvals: .
are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened oa staff ;

records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require-
ments.on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose
names appear in incoming dispatches. These’ are listed in Attachment 2. 201
dossiers should be opened in the following categories: ; nF

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-
proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested
for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who : are of opera-

a a tional interest for training purposes only. :

 

(2) Persons for whom the field requests a. 201 opening.

- (3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats. of ‘other than

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling 0 out and 1 submitting
a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign-
ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201’s. A field
station may request the: opening of a 201. file-by writing. 201- in the Head-
quarters file or cross-reference box. on the dispatch form and/or after’ the
subject’s name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening
is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by -
placing 201- after the term “File” on the last line of the.transimission. IP/AN-
will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-
bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of
