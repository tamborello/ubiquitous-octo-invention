the contemplated kidnaping of PEDRO DIAZ LANZ, former hedd / r
of the Cuban Air Force, who is presently residing in Miami,
Florida.

According to NAPIER, his informant was recently
in Havana, Cuba and was approached by Cuban officials con-
cerning the possibility of getting LANZ to Cuba. The
informant is alleged to have related that he would not get
involved, but informed the Cuban officials he knew a person
who would be interested and who could possibly accomplish
the mission. Informant advised a representative from.Cuba
is scheduled to arrive in Miami on December 4, 1959, to

Yard, Havana, Cuba. SALAZAR and DELGADO mentioned to him

the possibility of getting DIAZ LANZ out of the United States
into Cuba. — Sold them he would have nothing to do
with such a matter but thought it could be done upon pay-
ment of a sufficient sum of money and that he knows a person
who would be interested; he would put them in contact with
this individual. The individual referred to is JACK BROWN,
whose identity should not be disclosed, who is a deep-sea .
diver and operates an advertising business in Marathon,  -
Florida. BROWN owns a sea plane and a PT boat.

he
ce dvised he discussed the matter with
JACKKBROWN and it was: agreed between them that no effort
would be made to contact LANZ, but that an effort would be
made to have the Cuban’government pay a large sum of money
in advance upon the belief that BROWN would undertake the

job. \

  

He advised that under no circumstances should
BROWN be informed that the matter has been reported, as
BROWN then probably would not endeavor to détermine the
complete plan from the Cuban officials. [> Jrelated
he can control BROWN and, if necessary, he believes he
could induce BROWN to testify.

On December 2, 1959, BROWN had a Frey
telephonic conversation with JOSESALAZAR’ and an agreement (777

was made whereby a representative ‘would arrive at Key West,
Florida, on the first Cubana plane on the morning of Decem-
ber 4, 1959... BROWN was to meet the Cuban representative in
the airport manager's office, which upon reflection
believed to be not‘feasible as BROWN is well known to the
airport manager.

ee SALAZAR on December 3, 1959, and
.outlined the danger of having such a meeting in Key West,

and suggested the representative come to Miami. This change ca
