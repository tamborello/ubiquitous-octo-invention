-_ JFK Act 6 (4)

PCI RAY LONGTREE and pcr[___—————_—id who have

furnished pertinent information concerning ALEX during the |
past, year, are no longer in a position to ascertain informa-
tion concerning the subject.

Until the period of this report, neighbors of ALEX's
mother had been regularly contacted for information concerning
ALEX's visits to his mother, but during the past six or eight
months, they have furnished no information of any value; there-
fore, regular contact is-not being maintained with them. How-
ever, they are available for contact if a proper situation
develops in the future.

Contact ‘with EEN; LEVIN, superintendent of the Lake
View YcPost Offices tnt, which covers the residence of ‘the sub-
ject, has been discontinued on a regular basis in view of the —
fact that ALEX has renewed his lease until May, 1960; ‘therefore,
it does not appear that ALEX contemplates moving at least until
such time as the apartment building at Lake Shore Drive and
North Avenue, as described in the body of this report, is ready
for habitation.

B. ‘Possible Involvement in Jewel Robbery

In St. Moritz, Switzerland

FRANCIS GUERON, Swiss Central Police Bureau, Bern,
Switzerland, advised on April 22, 1959, that GUS ALEX reportedly
visited St. Moritz, Switzerland on March h, 1959. He stated
that on this same date a St. Moritz jewelry shop was robbed of
jewels valwing approximately :00,000 Swiss francs ($100, 000
United States currency). GUERON stated that he received his
information from the local police at St. Moritz. He stated
that the local police consider that the individual visiting in
St. Moritz was in fact identical with the subject of this case.

An inquiry was conducted by this office to determine
whether or not ALEX was in Chicago on the date of the robbery,
March l, 1959. This investigation will not be set out in detail
in this report since it has been made the subject of a separate
six-page memorandum, but it is noted that ALEX's exact where-
abouts during the first week of March are not known. However,
the payroll checks of the business firms owned by EDDY: VOGEL, \
from whom ALEX receives a salary as previously reported, were
negotiated by ALEX sometime prior to March 13, 1959. Since ;

these checks were dated on February 27, 1959, and on March 6,

1959, this would indicate that ALEX was in town between Febru-.
ary 27, 1959, and March 13, 1959, and between March 6, 1959,
and March 13, 1959.

IV. TRAVEL

T-1, above, advised that GUS and MARIANNE ALEX re-
turned to Chicago on either May 31, 1959 om): May 1,. 1959, from
deep sea fishing in Florida and in the Bahamas. This informant
stated that during the latter part of March of this year, ALEX
and his mother went to Florida for a brief vacation trip, while
MARIANNE went to Glendale, California, where she picked up her
mother and took her to Palm Springs, California for a brief
vacation. .

T-1 stated that ALEX planned to go to Canada osten-
sibly for fishing during thé week of May 7 or 1h, 1959, and ‘that
he also gave indications that he was planning a trip to Winona,
Minnesota. The informant stated that he believes that the ABEXes
plan to drive to Canada and to visit SAM ALEX, brother of GUS,
who is residing in Berrien County, Michigan, near Cassopolis,
Michigan under the name of SAM TAYLOR.

It is noted that as set out in previous reports
on ALEX, all of this information regarding the source of
ALEX's income has been developed previously. It was known
that ALEX was a partner in the 122 Club, that he sold
Atlas beer for Stanley Stupner, and that he was a salesman
for the Blatz Brewing Company. It was known that his
name appears on the payroll of the Deluxe Cigarette Service,
Incorporated, which firm is controledd by EDDY VOGEL,
Chicago top hoodlum.

 

C. Marital Status

CG T-3, who has furnished reliable information
in the’ past, advised that as incongruous as it may seem,-
the marriage relationship which exists between GUS ALEX
and his wife, MAREANNE RYAN ALEX is a most solid one,
based on love and respect. He said that years ago he
believes that their marriage was on rocky ground, and that
recently MARIANNE seems most devoted to AIEX. He stated
that he does not believe that MARIANNE RYAN would consider

even for a moment, any cooperation with a law enforcement

agency concerning furnishing information regarding her
husband.
