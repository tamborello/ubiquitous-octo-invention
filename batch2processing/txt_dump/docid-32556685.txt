FROM : SAC, CHICAGO (92-350 SUB L)
\ SUBJECT: GUS Qurx, aka
AR on

The following information was obtained from
CG 6502-C on the indicated dates. It is noted that information
from this source is monitored and reviewed on a daily
basis and pertinent information is expeditiously handled.

It is noted that since the departure of ALEX's
paramour, SUZANNE FUEGER, for the trip to visit her mother
in Germany, there has been a minimum of activity in the
apartment. In the past when ALEX has been in the apartment )
alone for any length of time he has had frequent visitors,
however, on this occasion it seems that the visitors are
at a minimum and conversation as well.

‘,
Also, the fact that ALEX was served a subpoena to \
appear before the Federal Grand Jury in Chicago apparently
has tal a considerable effect on ALEX and he has been reported
to be very upset, moody and possibly on the verge of a |
nervous breakdown, because of this and the fact that his 1

mother has been extremely ill and apparently is not expect WA
to live.

On the morning of May 18, 1965, NATHAN "BUTCH"

i LADON is in to visit ALEX and they discussed a card game

which tock place on the previous night which was ALEX's

usual Monday night card game. GUS said that he had never

seen EDDIE VOGEL as mad as he was over the game. Apparently

VOGEL lost a large sum of money. | AYA
