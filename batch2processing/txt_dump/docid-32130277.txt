Dear Mr. Innes: 2

This has reference to your letter of December
18, 1963, re: Lee Harvey OSWALD, Internal Security - R,
your file reference 163-364. .

al VME. AurelienACHASSE was unable to add ‘anything further
(on “than that which was contained in his letter to the

United States Secret Service, Mr. CHASSE stated that
the first paragraph of his letter was a summarization
of all the information he had obtained from the press
and from word of mouth, and he was unable to name anyone
who could furnish definite information regarding OSWALD's
appearance in Montreal, apart from Mr. Jean Paul TREMBLAY.

(wes ace conducted in Montreal revealed that |
A .

 

Paul NREMBLAY, Mr. TREMBLAY.stated that on the day Hé— Gs
“was” gl¥en the pamphlet by the person who he positively  ~~~~~~—
identifies as Lee Harvey OSWALD, he also saw approximately
six other people handing out leaflets. Mr. TREMBLAY is
uncertain about the dates the incident took place but
believes it occurred in August. Photographs of persons
participating in the Quebec ~- Washington - Guantanamo Walk
for Peace in Montreal on the 7th and 8th of June 1963,
' were shown to Mr, TREMBLAY, who positively identified two
-, of them as being engaged in distributing leaflets on the
day in question. One of the persons he positively ;
identified was the same woman described in your memorandum.
ib The other person identified by Mr. TREMBLAY is believed to
preaighne E,—of_San_ Antonio, Texas. He could not

he A check of our records reveals that some o /the
Americans taking part in the Quebet¢ Washington -

Guantanamo Walk for Peace were Neil WORTH, Co-
of the Committee for Non-Violent Action, Bradfore

took place in August of 1963 judging by his identifica-
