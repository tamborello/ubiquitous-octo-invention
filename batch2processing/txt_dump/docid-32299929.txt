REGISTRY TO DETERMINE WHETHER COPIES OF DOCUMENTS ISSUED AT TIME OF

) BORDER CROSSING IN AUGUST, 1968, COULD BE LOCATED, THESE DOCUMENTS
NOT FILED BY DATE, VIN OR NAME OF DRIVER BUT BY FOLIO NUMBER ASSIGNED
FOR EACH VEHICLE WHEN CAR ENTERS MEXICO. IN VIEW OF PASSAGE OF TIME,
LACK OF FOLIO NUMBER AND POORLY ORGANIZED CONDITION OF THESE RECORDS,
SOURCE IN FEDERAL AUTOMOBILE REGISTRY ADVISED IT WOULD BE VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE To LOCATE SUCH A DOCUMENT. ce
ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
