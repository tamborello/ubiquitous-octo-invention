Criminal Activities and Methods of Operation

All. information in the possession of the Havana Office to
date with reference to the activities of the American gangsters
in Cuba relates to the operation of gambling casinos and
similar enterprises, Inasmuch as gambling is legal in Havana, |

- these matters are not strictly criminal activities.

According to information furnished by CI HAV-11, MEYER LANSKY
was in conference with Mr, JAMES ENNIS, of the Hotel Nacional
in Havana, in January, 1955. Informant was of the opinion that
LANSKY was trying to arrange the gambling concession at the
Hotel Nacional which, under authority of a law decree published
1/27/55, could be authorized to operate a gambling casino, At

-that time there were negotiations under way for the purchase of the

Hotel Nacional from the Cuban Government by the Pan rican
Affiliates, a subsidiary of the Pan American World Airways, ‘In-

LANSKY was awaiting the results of these negotiations to see if
he could then obtain the gambling concession at the Hotel. Nacional

formation received by the Havana Office was to the effect that oy

’ Source further stated that SANTOS TRAFFICANTE TRey of Tampa,

Florida, is presently running a numbers operation out of the
Hotel Sevilla Biltmore in Havana, It is noted that although
gambling is authorized “in Havana, numbers writing is not but
it has always been tolerated inasmuch as it affords a considerable
source. of graft for the local police, Source stated that the fact
TRAFFICANTE is able to operate a numbers racket out of the Sevilla
Biltmore Hotel is an indication that TRAFFICANTE has backing from
the Cuban Government, It is noted that the Sevilla Biltmore Hotel

Source also stated that TRAFFICANTE is attempting to obtain
the gambling concession at the Comodoro Hotel in Havana and |
apparently has the inside track because of b acking received |
by him from General CANTILLO, It is to be noted that: the :
Comodoro Hotel does not have gambling facilities at the l
present time but is eligible to obtain authorization for - |
game under the new Cuban law decree, This hotel is a combination - |
beach club and hotel and ‘has about 2,000 members in addition to ;
transient guests who may visit the hotel. Gd

CI HAV-11 on March 19, 1955, advised that he had received
information to the effect that TRAFFICANTE was attempting to .

take over the gambling operations at the San Souci Night Club.
Source stated that the San Souci was presently owned by

Tropicana interests who bought up a controlling percentage
of the stock in order to squeeze out NORMAN ROTHMAN who had :
operated the San Souci as front man and ostensible owner : ,
although it has always been. indicated that he was bank-rolled

- by someone else. (Y(t 0 ,

In connection with the activities of TRAFFICANTE, it is noted
that HAV-11 on April 18, 1955, advised that TRAFFICANTE had
arrived in Havana on April 17, 1955, although according to
previous reports, his arrival date had been scheduled for

April 20, 1955. SK
The Miami Herald for April 21, 1955, reported the finding of
the murdered body of CHARLIE WALL on April 20, 1955. WALL
was described as the -76-year old statesman of the Florida
underworld, He had been shot seven or eight times with a
shotgun ‘and his throat’ had been cut from ear to ear. It is
not known whether WALL's murder 1s connected in any way with
“the fact that TRAFFICANTE arrived in Havana on April 17 after
having previously announced to his friends that he was coming
to Havana on April 20, 1955. “

taken from reports submitted by the Miami Office in GIIF Surveys,
