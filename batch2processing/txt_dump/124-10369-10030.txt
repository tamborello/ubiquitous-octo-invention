Memorandum Branigan to Sullivan
RE: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT

JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY
62-108060

We feel] we should disseminate this data since
we have previously disseminated the information we received — -
from Yuri Nosenke regarding the assassination even though
we recognized some of the data was not subject to proof,
particularly, that occurring within the Soviet Union.

We feel that by deounenting|’ “Jas a "confidential (3)
informant, contact with whom has bééhn insufficient to _
establish his reliability,” we will alert other agencies
that the information has net been established as true.

We have received information from numerous other
sources that the Soviets did mourn the death of President
Kennedy and that Soviet leaders felt they could work with
President Kennedy. :

ACTION:
