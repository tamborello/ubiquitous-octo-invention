Re: John Cesar GROSSI

Reference is made to your letter of September ll,
1964. Dr. Herman L. TRACY, Classics Department, Mchaster.
University, Hamilton, Ontario was interviewed as requested.
He stated that on August 29, 1964, while visiting in
Kingston, Ontario, he nad occasion to hold a brief.con—
versation with GROSSI's wife, now Patricia Ann (irs. Jack)
BOWEN, who resides at 36 Ellerbeck Street, Kingston.

2. Dr. TRACY related his conversation with Mrs.
BOWEN and the only pertinent information regarding this
case is to the effect that GRCSSI stayed at the Bruce
MacDonald. Motor Hotel in Ottawa some time during the
summer of 1964 and left without paying his bill.

ee - 3. Dr. TRACY has not heard from GROSSI since he

was released. from Kingston- Penitentiary in 1960. Drs

TRACY did state that an inmate of Dorchester Penitentiary,
Dorchester, New Brunswick, Ralph G. PARKS, had corresponded
with GROSSI following his release from. Kingston Penitentiary.
If other enquiries now being conducted fail to provide
results, we will attempt to have PARKS interviewed.

: Loeal sources of information in the Hamilton. area.
including the Credit Bureau, local. police forces, employ
ment agencies, etc. were checked but it does not appears
that GROSSI is. in that area at the. present time. fem d of!

 

5. Enquiries continue and you will be further advised. -
