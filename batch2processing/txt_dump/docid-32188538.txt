SA JOHN R, ANDERSON from Chicago. and advised as follows:

He had in the recent past been associated
with an INA or ENA (LNU), who he described asa very ,
active:and fanatic member of the Fair Play for Cuba ©
Committee (FPCC). This girl traveled to California.
and Texas in connection with FPCC activities. The girl
had worked as a barmaid at the Seville Bar, 71st Street
and Columbus Avenue, New York City, and had regularly.
met with other FPCC members at the Crystal Bar, 71st °
Street. and Columbus A e, New York City. He furnished
a Gescription of thts vidual and advised that he
did not know of her whereabouts or activities .for the
past two weeks, or if. she had any connection with the,
assassination of the. President. | . :

 
 
 

: Investigation was conducted to Adentity
INA or ENA and informants contacted in the: New York
area familiar with FPCC activities were unable to furnish
any information. :

The possibility existed that she was. =
identical with ADA MARIE DRITSAS, born October 22, 1936,
New York, Bufile 100-431305, New York file 100-137717;:
believed in Havana, Cuba. No active investigation was
contucted at the Seville and Crystal Bars, New York City,
inasmuch as there appeared no need to determine. the
whereabouts of all FPCC speakers at that time.
