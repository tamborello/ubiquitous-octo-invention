have been the latter, although given the fact of conversations
with the Division Chief, presumably he would have been on the
distribution for these cables. But probably it would have
bean restricted to the Director or the Deputy Director or
the Division Chief, and probably Mr.Helms'Deputy.

Mr. Baron. It was Mr. Tweedy's testimony that although |
he composed such cables, they went out, as far as he could
recall, under your signature or from your office.

Mr. Bissell. That would be a very normal procedure.

 

Mr. Baron. Do you recall discussing with Mr. Tweedy
the fact that he should write such cables, whether or not you
recall the specific cables?

Mr. Bissell. I really don't.

Mr. Baron. Mr. Tweedy also testified that the cable
traffic that he was sending ‘to the Congo was part of a back and
forth communication in which he was receiving information from|
the Chief of Station in Leopoldville about the kind of
access that he could gain to Lumumba.

pid you read such cables from the Chief of Station in
Leopoldville?

Mr. Bissell. I am sure I did. I don't remember it
specifically. °

Mr. Wides. Do you recall the question of access
being one part of the exploration that you were doing?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, that indeed would have been a key

part of it.

Mr. Wides. Do you recall that being so?

Mr. Bissell. I don't specifically recall it. But
since I am clear that at least in the case of O'Donnell, and
I now presume in the case of Mr. Tweedy, I authorized and
indeed directed this planning and preparatory activity. A
major part of this would have been a search for ways in
which access could be gained.

Mr. Baron. And what kind of access were you looking
for at that time?

Mr. Bissell. Obviously I would aay the access of an
individual who for one reason or another could get close to
Lumumba.

Mr. Baron. In the summer and very early fall of 1960
this would have been access to Lumumba for the purpose of
assassinating him rather than snatching him from U.N. custody?

Mr. Bissell. Well, it could have been for the pur-
pose really of eliminating him from his thenpolitical acti-

vities. And that could have been assassination, or it

‘could have involved some form of incapacitation, or it could

possibly have been, in your words, snatching him so
that he could be put into the custody of what we regarded
as friendly authorities.

Mr. Baron. Would you have sought information from

the Chief of Station on whether he could gain access to

only clear recollection I have is of what I think was
the initial discussion on this matter that 1 had with Justin
o'Donnell. And I believe that he and 1 had that alone, in
other words, that Mr. Tweedy was not present in the dis-
cussion I had with O'Donnell.

Mr. Baron. We will turn later to filling out the
details of your conversation with Justin O'Donnell.

For the moment, aticking with Mr. tweedy's testimony,

he also testified that during this same period of time he

composed cables that went to the Chief of Station in Leopold-
ville inquiring at to Lf .the Chief of Station could gain access
to Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him.
pid you send such cable?
Mr. Bissell. tT would think the record would show
whather they were sent. If they were waent the record would
presumably also show if I signed them. And I expect that
if they were sent Y would have signed them. But I don't
happen at this distance in time to remember the specific
cables.
Mr. Wides. If you had sent cables of that kind,
Mr. Bissell, would ‘they have gone in the normal channels out
from the African Division, or might they more likely have
gone on & restricted basis from yourself to the Station
Chief without -~

Mr. Bissell. I don't happen to remember them, but

said so I would certainly accept that.

Mr. Bissell. They might have, although again

there is a record that something wags said, but I had

recollection that things went that far. But that still could

TESTIMONY OF RICHARD N. BISSELL

Mr. Baron, Mr. Bissell, since we have talked with you
last about the subject of the Congo we have taken. testimony
from a number of witnesses. The first that we would like to}
turn to is Bronson qweedy, who in 1960 and 1961, as I am
gure you will recall, was the Chief of the African Division.
He indicated to us in his testimony that he had a number of
talks with you, probably in the summer or fall of 1960,

where the prospect of assassinating Lumumba wae raised.

 

 

What can you tell us about those discussions?

Mr. Bissell. tam afraid I can't tell you anything.
rt don't remember the specific discussions with him. It seems’
to me, however, entirely to be ‘expected that such conversa~
tions took place. I think I testified previously, but in any
case, I remember assigning Justin O'Donnell to study
the possibilities and to make plans for the assassination or
elimination of Lumumba - And since that was in the Africa
area, I think he most unlikely that I would have done that
without saying something to the Division Chief about Ate

Mr. Baron. Mr- tTweedy's testimony was to the effect
that he was in fact not being informed of some on-going
operation or some instruction that was contemplated, but
rather that you and he were discussing the feasibility of

assassinating Lumumba.

pid such discussions take place?
