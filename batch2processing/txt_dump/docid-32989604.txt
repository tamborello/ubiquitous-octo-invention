case the effort would be made to protect legitimate, but sensitive
operations which are currently in being. I suggested to Mr. Hills
that the Executive has the right to negotiate with the Senate Committee
an arrangement whereby a representative of the executive dgency

would be present not to stifle testimony, but to suggest that testimony

be given in Executive Session or be limited only to the Senators them-
selves in order to protect information of such sensitive nature as to
require special treatment. I told Mr. Hills that it may well be that

the representative of the agency appearing with a witness should be an
individual with specific expertise in the subject matter involved in the
testimony rather than a legal counsel. Mr. Hills agreed that such
expertise would be essential. Therefore, I advised him that we would
support efforts to have counsel present during the interview or testimony
of FBI employees or former employees.

 

en

Mr. Hills' second point was executive privilege. He said
that he has researched the available references to executive privilege
at the White House and found that all relate to material prepared as
defensive measures and there is little in the way of positive statements
of principles of law concerning executive privilege. It is the feeling of
the President's Counsel, Mr. Buchen, that the White House must develop
a statement of principles to be applied by the President when it becomes
mecessary to claim executive privilege in the face of a demand for
testimony or documents by the Senate Committee which the President
decides should not be complied with. Mr Hills said that the President's
counsel believes that it would be ab improper course for the President
to wait until a crisis arises before this matter is reviewed. I told
Mr. Hills that I thought it would be more destructive to the presidency
if the President were to claini executive privilege over a matter which
could not be justified under law. Mr. Hills said that was the exact
concermof Mr. Buchen and that they wanted to avoid at all cost having
the President claim executive privilege over matters that would merely
embarrass an agency and didmot go to the heart of the agency's
responsibilities or to the independence of the presidency itself.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams pe
Re: Senate Select Committee, etc. SECRET

Mr. Hills said that he has been discussing with the publisher
of the "Washington Post, "the publisher of the "New York Times, "
Daniel Schorr, and others in the news media the question of why the
press has been so critical of the claims of executive privilege within
the recent past, and it became clear as a result of his discussion that
their concern is that the claim has been misused. He said his efforts
were to convince the members of the press that a responsible claim of
executive privilege should be recognized by the press and given reasonable
support.

Mr. Hills said that in an effort to develop some general
principles by which the President could clearly indicate that any claim
of executive privilege that might become necessary is reasonable, they
wilVarranging for conferences with the Attorney General, responsible
law professors who are experis in the area of executive privilege, and
others who might be able to help Mr. Buchen prepare a paper for the
President stating the general guidelines under which the President will
claim executive privilege. In order to understand the areas of concern
to the various agencies that might result in a request for the President to
claim executive privilege, Mr. Hills said that the President's counsel
has requested that the agencies furnish them a summary of such critical
areas. He said that he had been advised by Larry Silberman that he should
approach the Bureau carefully because it would be most difficult to obtain
such information from the FBI. Mr. Hills said that he did not fully under-
stand the relationship of the Director with the Attorney General and the
Deputy Attorney General but that he wanted to request that the Bureau
consider briefing the President's Counsel.

Itold Mr. Hills that the Bureau had no difficulty with the
Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General when it was necessary to
brief them concerning sensitive matters but that we operated as much as
possible on the "need“to-know" principle and that should we receive
requests from any source outside the FBI we would be reluctant to
furnish sensitive information unless there were in fact reasons for
the inquirer to have a need to know. I told him that in regard to the
request from the President's Ceunsel, I was confident that the Bureau
would be willing to provide representatives and a briefing on sensitive
matters that could become subject to a claim of executive privilege

Director Sec'y

on eee

On March 27, 1975, Mr. Rodrick Hills, Associate Counsel
to the President, came io my office and advised that he is preparing
to discuss with Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Committee,
several questions concerning the procedures that will be followed by
the Senate Select Committee in asking Tor testimony and documents from
the. Executive Branch. He said the Commilée plans to publish rules
concerning their procedures today or tomorrow and therefore his
discussions must be conducted with them prompily.

RICHER

Mr. Hills said that-it is proposed that the Executive Branch
agencies provide counsel to represent them before the Senate Committee
when Government employees or former employees are called to testify.

He said that CIA has agreed to start that procedure and he inquired

if the FBI would agree to have counsel present during interviews or - G
testimony of witnesses from the FBI. He said the White House is con- ~
cerned that if the suggestion is made by a representative of the White

House it could appear that the White House is attempting to interfere with

the Committee proceedings by intimidating witnesses and having a repeat
experience similar to that which occurred when former Counsel to the
President John Dean insisted upon sitting in with employees during inter~-
views with the FBI.

I told Mr. Hills that I saw an important difference between
the efforts made by the former Counsel to the President and the effort
that would be made by counsel appearing before the Senate Committee.
The distinction is that in the former case the effort was intended to
intimidate witnesses in ona ? to conceal criminal activity and in the © present
