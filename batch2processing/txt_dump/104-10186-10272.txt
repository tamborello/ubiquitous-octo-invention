Sources A former Cuban IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelligence
Service until April 1964.

Following is a translation of a report which source A
wrote concerning a shipment of explosives to Mexico: ‘

“The Communist Party of El Salvador had asked me to
send them twenty-five, one quarter pound packages of
gelatin explosives. They requegted that the explosives be
sent to Mexico where they would recover them and take
them to El Salvador.

“In view of the request, I spoke with Manuel PINEIRO
regarding the shipment itself, as well as the amount.
PINEIRO answered by telling me to do so.

“During my trip to Mexico (March 1964} I spoke with
Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez regarding this shipment and he told
me that there was no need of my sending the explosives —~
to Mexico as this type of explosive was available in the
Embassy. I then. told RODRIGUEZ that I would answer the
request from El Salvador.

“Upon returning to Cuba I spoke with PINEIRO. who told
we not to send the explosives as the orders now were to
send nothing but money due to the recent exposure of the
arms shipment to Venezuela."
