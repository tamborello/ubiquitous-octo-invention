AT BRADENTON, FLORIDA

RUFO LOPEZ FRESQUET, 2118 - 12th Avenue West,
Bradenton, Florida, advised SA RAYMOND N. BYERS on
May, 8, 1961 as follows:

-He knew of SANTO TRAFFICANTE in Cuba and knew

he operated gambling casinos at Havana Hilton and Sans

Soucie. He said he also knew that RAUL. GONZALEZ, worked
for TRAFFICANTE in the Hilton casino. He said he was
not an. associate of GONZALEZ or TRAFFICANTE- and knew
nothing of their business arrangements. He explained’
that the only reason he approached GONZALEZ to arrange
for escape from Cuba to the United States was because
he was desperate and in fear of his life if he remained
in Cuba longer.

FRESQUET said he did not associate with
GONZALEZ in the United States nor does he know who
GONZALEZ associated with. He said he heard that
GONZALEZ opened a restaurant in Miami which soon
failed and GONZALEZ then joined the resistance movement

against CASTRO. He said GONZALEZ landed in Cuba during -

the recent invasion and is now a prisoner according to
the list of prisoners published in the U. S.

FRESQUET said he was never associated in the
same circles as the gamblers, and he knows nothing of
their activities andYor associates. He said he has no
idea where TRAFFICANTE is now located or what his
financial condition might be. Nor does he know how
TRAFFICANTE enteredthe United States. He pointed out
that the people working for the overthrow of CASTRO
do not associate with the gamblers, and he is not in a

JEK Law 11(8

position to obtain any information concerning TRAFFICANTE,
