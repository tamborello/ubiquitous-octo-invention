return to Italy. Consequently, the foglio di via which was
previously issued’ and is now suspended pending the outcome
of the present proceedings could not be reinstated nor a
new one issued. Should the Tribunal of Rome hold, on the
other hand, that DE LUCIA is a citizen of Italy- the old’
foglio: di via, would ‘be reinstated once the Tribunals deci-
sion has become final. However; it is probable that “DE.
LUCIA’ would immediately: appeal siich''a decision to the- ‘Court
of ‘Appeals and subsequently, if need be, to: the Supreme
Court which would mean that :the foglio di via ‘would have to
remain suspended pending: the outcome of further proceedings.

an On August 22,. 1966, CG .T= 5. advised: that "BUTCH"
BLASI - acts as a "courier" between ANTHONY ACCARDO, . PAUL

RICCA and'SAM GIANCANA, reputed heads of. the Chicago crime '

tified individuals were observed meeting attorney. JACK WAS- |

o' Hare: International Airport, Chicago. ‘

WASSERMAN appeared on October 12, 1966, representing
PAUL DE LUCIA: in current deportation proceedings, at the —
U.S. Court of Appeals. At that time. WASSERMAN was accom=
' panied by hoodlum attorney JOSEPH BULGER: (deceased) and
oral arguments were heard before Judges JOHN HASTINGS, WIN .
KNOCH and LUTHER SWYGERT, Assistant U.S. Attorney JOHN
LULINSKI presented the: arguments for the U.S. Government. .

under advisement and expected to render an opinion in about
! ' three weeks from that date. | The source advised that upon

the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals, DE LUCIA's:attor-

neys have 15 days in which to -petition for a rehearing be-
fore the U.S. Court of Appeals and if a rehearing is denied,
then the last legal recourse is to apply for a Writ of - me

CG. 92-347.

: CG T-3 furnished substantially the same informa-
tion concerning DE LUCIA's activities at O'Hare International.
Airport. . ;

on. October .10, 1966, a “confidential source ‘abroad
advised of ‘the receipt of an anonymous “letter. dated :Septem-
ber 12,1966, which alleges that DE LUCIA's brother-in-law,
MICHELANGELO CHIACCHIO, was recently a guest of DE LUCIA
in New York for about a month. CHIACCHIO is described as
the Mayor of Grumo Nevano, a town near Naples, Italy,. The
anonymous letter pointed out that CHIACCHIO brought with
‘him a suitcase which contained items of an unknown nature
and which he was able to get by Italian customs authorities.
‘Subsequent to his return to Grunio Nevano;. ‘CHIACCHIO. gifted
many persons with- cigarette lighters and vdrious other items.

ay on. November 4, 1966, CG T-6 advised that no “infor-
mation was available that MICHELANGELO CHIACCHIO. was a-guest
of | DE ‘LUCIA in Chicago. .

- : On November 4, 1966, CG T-7 advised that no infor-
mation ‘was available that DE LUCIA entertained any guest c
from Italy in his home during. July or August, 1966. LE

   
 

. “On October 28, 1966, the confidential ' ‘gource.
abroad advised ‘that DE LUCIA has instituted, ‘proceedings |
before the Tribunal of Rome for a judgment stating that he
is not an Italian citizen. These proceedings. are only in
' their preliminary phase and it is impossible to say when
a ‘decision will be made.. : se . °

It is to-be noted, however, that! it is unlikely
that the attorneys for DE LUCIA will’ take. any steps’ whatz
soever to expedite ‘the proceedings since it.is in his.
interést to stall matters in order to put off for as long
as possible a possibly unfavorable decision.

Should DE LUCIA obtain a judgment that he is ‘not’

an Italian citizen, the Government of Italy would then be
precluded from issuing a foglio di via. directing him to
