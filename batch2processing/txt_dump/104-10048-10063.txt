4, As you may know, an Agency task force has been
conducting an in-depth study of all information relating to
issues surrounding the Agency's support for the Warren
Commission investigation. This study has been underway
since early July and, because of the detailed nature of the
review, may require as much as another two months if it
is to be completed with the thoroughness that we believe
“necessary.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM : John H. Waller
Inspector General

SUBJECT : Jack Anderson Reference to 28 November
1963 CIA Cable

1. The Operations Group of CI Staff has provided a copy
of the cable about which you inquired. <A copy is attached at
Tab A. It is a dissemination of a report by a British journalist
stating that a man named Ruby was in Cuba in 1959, where he
visited an American gangster-gambler named "Santos," who
was living luxurously in jail. This dissemination was based
on a 27 November 1963 cable from London, a copy of which is
attached at Tab B. A follow-up cable from London on
29 November commented on the source of the story, raising
a question as to his reliability. A copy is at Tab C. A more.
detailed statement about the man is contained in a report
passed to the FBI on 12 December 1963, a copy of which is
at Tab D,

2. On 7 January 1964 the FBI provided CIA with a report
that Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in 1959; a copy is at Tab E,
On 30 January CIA provided additional information to the
Bureau on this subject; a copy is at Tab F.

3. The following points of coincidence are probably of
interest to Senator Baker: Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in
1959, as stated in the report that gave. rise to the present
query; the name "Santos'' is also the given name of Trafficante,
although it is not clear that these are the same persons. While
there are reservations about the reliability of the source of
the report which gave rise to the present question, we are not
in a position at this time to evaluate it definitively. It is noted
that the description of "Santos" as living in luxury in a Cuban
prison is similar to a version also reported in a 16 May 1974
story in the Outlook Section of the Washington Post.
