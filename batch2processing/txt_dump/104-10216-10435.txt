1. Transmitted unter separate cove: is a copy of the cable mentioned
in paragraph 3 of Reference C. As will pe seen, the text of this cable
differs a zreat deal from that succcsted in Reference A. We discussed the -
Reference A suggestioa within the £ ution, -ad, in essence, with UNSNATU/9.
We came to the conclusion that sucn a stron persc.al attack on UXSNAFU/19
would probably accomplish little since UNSNAFU/19 nad already senz in his
version to Eavana and could be expected tc :.ve the backing of rost or all of
the Paris Embassy personnel - despite nesle claims to the to..ic. 7, sade
privately to UNSHAFU/9 by UNSHAFJ/1 and AMzALD/2. Also considerea, especially
by UNSNAPU/9, was the possible effect such ction might have on WLASH/l.
UNSNAPU/9 yas, and still is, very r-luctant to take any action which might
adversely @ffect AMEASH/1 or force «MLASH/1 into a position not of his o«n

choosing, 1.e., to have to take up the defense of UNSNAFU/9 without being able

to choose his own time and place.

2 We are trying to get tle <tory into the prese here, as stated in
Reference C, and will advise you of any results obtained. A dispatch on the
subject of planning for UNSTAFU/9 will be forthcoming ies
