and noted that he was visiting Pittsburgh from his .
' Johnstown, Pa., residence during the week of February 19,
1961. She added that he frequented a few of his old haunts
and was evidently "business-minded" during this visit.

 
    

 

PG T-3 advised that officers of the North Star Cement Block
Company are extremely upset about the recent prison sentences
imposed and adverse publicity directed against. highly-placed
officials of the General Electric Company and the Westinghouse
Electric Corporation for price-fixing and antitrust violations.
‘He stated that the North Star Cement Block Company is ostensibly
a member of "an association," not otherwise described, but
believed to be an orgatization of Pittsburgh or Western
Pennsylvania cement block manufacturers.

The aforementioned informant stated that members are engaged

in a ‘conspiracy which may-include price-fixing and that North
Star officials, JOHN CONTI and. ROY VEY, are so jumpy lest

they become involved that they are_making up a story to the
effect that an anonymous caller told CONTI that a representative
of the Justice Department had been making inquiries about the
association and the membership of North Star in it. He said
North Star's. representative to the association may be the
vice-president of this association and that the story that

CONTI made up and will tell may cause North Star ‘to putime

out of the association before some members tell. investigators
all they know. He added that CONTI ‘and VEY, along with the
PRUNER brothers, ALDO and AILMO, who are also executites of

the North Star Cement ‘Block Company are extremely worried about
being called before a Federal Grand Jury looking into the
activities of both the association and/or SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA.
