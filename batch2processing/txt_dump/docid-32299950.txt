VERA was provided a copy of a letter directed to
United Press International at Puerto Rico from a group known
as M-7 but alleged no knowledge of M~7. He did stated that
M-7 possibly meant Movimiento Revolucionario de Julio
(Revolutionary Movement of July), July being the seventh month.

San Juan is of the opinion that M-7 may possibly
be the sub-group of CU referred to by VERA but is unable to
pursue this matter further with VERA a the present time to
protect the identity of MM 1337-s.

San Juan anticipates continued contact with VERA
regarding bombing matters. VERA admitted having received
training in making bombs while in Cuba during the Cuban
revolution but denied any involvement or knowledge of persons
involved in the bombings of the consulates of Venezuela,

Peru and Argentina at San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Contact logical sources regarding CU in an effort
to determine present membership, current goals and activities
and determine if sub-group of CU organized 8/4-9/74 is M-7
