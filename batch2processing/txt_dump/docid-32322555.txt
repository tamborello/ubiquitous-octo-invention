Title: ASSASSINATION MATERIAL DISCLOSURE ACT

Synopsis: JFK Task Force returning original files to Indianapolis.
Details: Enclosed for Indianapolis are the following file(s):

IP 62-0-18238 IP 80-0-1574
IP 66-A2825-Sub B-18 thru 18EF
IP 62-0-17632 thru 176327

The originals removed from these files and replaced with
duplicate copies of the original were accessioned to the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) pursuant to the JFK
Records Collection Act of 1992. Provision of the JFK Act allowed
for certain information to be postponed from public release until
the year 2017; therefore, the pages have NOT necessarily been
released for public review in their entirety.

Under the JFK Act, originals to all material deemed
assassination records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of
whether the material is open in full or released with information
postponed. Therefore, any documents or pages from FBI files
accessioned to NARA pursuant to the JFK Act are no longer
considered the possession of the FBI. The duplicate pages have
been inserted strictly for research purposes.

The copies contained within the previously mentioned
file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date

classification. 7 2
