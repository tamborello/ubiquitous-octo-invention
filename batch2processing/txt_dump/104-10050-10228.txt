SU"JECT: M"elay in sending the first cable about
OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the delay (tb the Mexico
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book as a
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet.case officer (which
in ny view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know what he was’ talking about).

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 Oc
convers ation would have been picked up on the mornin
2nd of October. ‘The Russian language portion wouldthave.g
to the Russian/English transcriber on thé 3rd of-0c ober. the
trans lation’ would have been returned the follai y
at vhich time, the Soviet case. officer woukd hay
the photographic coverage. That coverage “would ‘not have been.
in the station before the 7th since tha fiJm was still in the
camera on the 3rd of October and Wass ‘picked up probably on
the 4th, processed and passed 49% eStation on the next work
day vh ich would have been Ma says, (3 Uctober.

  
 

  

  
 

 
 
 
 
   
 

3. Later the £ilm was bs en out of the camera every. da. op
but at that time, the films tayed in the camera until a full a
rotl was completed which might take three or four days. me | a

4. <A name trace could have been reques ted on the bas is a
of the name alone but. that wasn't the way. Win Scott ran that ,
Station. He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the
telephone coverage ..s ometimes..there_was..a U.S.. .automo bile
license number. It was also part of the "numbers game" of
jus tify ing a project.ty the number of dis patches, cables or
reports - produced. ;
