Police Department are attempting to operate an honest depart-
ment and they were provided with the basic information about
their respective officers being suspected of being involved
in gambling payoffs. In addition to above the informant

did provide specific details as to the amount of money the
bag man received, how it was split between the two officers,
what groups of gamblers were involved in the payoffs, how
Lieutenant WARNER went about advising certain gamblers of
proposed raids and details as to other favors these officers
received from gamblers. This specific information was not
provided to the above mentioned officials for fear of possibly
compromising the informant.

It is noted that NO 1232-C-TE is an excellent
informant providing information concerning gambling activities
on a local and national level, —~

In April, 1965 NO 1232-C-TE advised of the
identity of a fireman in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. He
identified this individual as a former telephone company
employee and that this person was putting in telephone taps Ss
for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office on some major
gamblers. Informant stated that because of contacts of
smart gamblers in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office these
gamblers became aware of these "taps" almost immediately
after they were installed.

Above information was not disseminated to the
Sheriff's Office because of its delicate nature and again
the possibility of compromising the informant.

NO 66-2404

In June, 1965 NO 1232-C-TE advised he had planned
moving his gambling operations to St. Tammany Parish,
Louisiana and in making these arrangements had to promise
the Sheriff of St. Tammany Parish $100 a week to operate.

This information was not disseminated for fear of compromising
the informant and further as the informant changed his plans
and did not move his operations to St. Tammany Parish.

 

: In June, 1965 NO 1232-C-TE provided information
that one of the biggest horse and sports books operating» fy
apparently with some immunity, in the downtown and Frenc
Quarter area of New Orleans was the SA A operation. aah
Informant stated that SAIA and Superintendentof.-Policew.—

vs JOSE. RUSSO had been close friends and have taken trips
together such as to the Kentucky. Derby. Informant feels that
GIARRUSSO does allow SAIA a freer. hand in his operations
than other gamblers operating in the same area. Informant
does not know if this is through past friendship or from
money paid to the Superintendent. -He had no specific
information that Superintendent GIARRUSSO had ever received
any money or things of value from SAIA,

Above information was not disseminated because
of its non-specific nature.

New Orleans will continue to review its control

files in this matter on a six months basis and the Bureau
will be advised.
