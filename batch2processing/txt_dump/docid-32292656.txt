Re Chicago FD 143 to the Bureau, dated ed an ?

and Bureau letter to Chicago, dated 4/18/6 2, requesting an .
FD 143 to reach the Bureau by 7/10/62. (Y

As the Bureau has been advised, the location for.
this source was temporarily discontinued in April, 1962,
in view of the extensive remodeling being performed on. the
establishment. Means of access for re-entry was obtained
and re-entry was accomplished during July 12, 1962. One mite
unit was installed in the same location as the previous unit,
however this unit is geared to receive conversation primarily
from the rear wall of the main dining room area. It is noted
that the remodeling process transformed the old meeting room
in the rear to a storage area and no longer contains facilities
for dining. It would appear that pertinent conversations | :
will now take place at the rear of the main dining room in ioe
a specially constructed booth, compiate with telephones and !
telephone jacks. {UV (vy

Regarding the telephone wiring,the remodeling
completely changed the wiring system to the point where the
old frame previously used is no longer in use even though
the physical setup remains. Physical observation and the 4
study of photographs taken from the outside of the building \
indicate that the telephone wiring is now connected to the ;
outside, ,of the building. It is felt that if any work performed
on the ‘Outside of the establishment would possibly draw
aftention, ;therefore it is felt necessary to re-enter the

_esta lishment, at an ear date and attempt to activate the
ys ite unit troii wathin. (DD
