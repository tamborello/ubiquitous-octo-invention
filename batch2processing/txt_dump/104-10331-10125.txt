Note For:

 

Subject: ARRB Determinations

1. Per our phone conversation earlier today, please
find attached a copy of the 28 November letter to the DCI
from David Marwell, Executive Director, Assassination
Records Review Board and, a copy of the document in question —
(104-10015-10398). .I have marked in brackets the
information (3 items) that we proposed for postponement. As
you will note from the letter, the ARRB upheld only 2
postponements (Whitten! s name) and scheduled the document
for review on “name day” in December. The ARRB released the
phrase “A Good KUBARK Asset”. Please ignore the column
“ARRB releases”. These numbers refer to the number of
deletions in these documents in the August 1993 release to
NARA. Many of those deletion can now be released under
current guidelines.

2. The timeline for this ‘determination (33 documents)
is as follows:

November 13/14 ARRB meeting

November 28 Notification to Agency of ARRB
decisions.
December 5S 7 day deadline for notifying White

‘House of plan to appeal (this
deadline was set by White House and
is not within the law).

December 28 ' 30. day deadline for White House
decision to release documents as
recommended by ARRB or to >» uphold an

appeal;
. OR
December 28 if no appeal, documents due at
NARA on this date as required by
law.

3. At DO's request (Ellie) I am including notes that
were prepared for the ADDO on the release of information in
recent ARRB determinations including document 104-100015-
10398 (paragraph 3.d.).
