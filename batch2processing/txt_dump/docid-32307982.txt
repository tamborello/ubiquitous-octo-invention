a round-table discussion with all of the members in the near
future, but now in view of the interviews this was indefinitely
postponed.** MISURACA indicated he may leave the area soon.

On February 6, 1967, SFT-1 furnished information that
he was in contact with MANNY FIGLIA and ANGELO MARINO last
night, in San Jose, California, after he had received his
instructions for the meet from FIGLIA. Informant stated that
he was instructed by ANGELO MARINO to carry out a "contract"
on one JOE VALENCIA, MARINO’ told informant VALENCIA operates
La Val's Catering Service in Berkeley, Calfirnia, and that
his individual is in debt to him in the amount of $4,000.00;
that he’ also had personal reasons for doing away with VALENCIA.
ANGELO continued that he had also attempted to collect the bad
debt through VALENCIA's aunt, ROSE PESCE, informing her that,
"If she did not pay, VALENCIA would be taken care of." ROSE
PESCE indicated that she could "care less" regarding VALENCIA's
welfare and refused to pay the debt.

ANGELO advised informant that he should make the
first contact with VALENCIA on a pretext, and after having
made the contact, the informant would have to carry out the
"contract" alone and within 24 hours after the initial con-
tact. . MARINO told informant that he would be paid $1,000. 00
plus a trip to Palm Springs, where he could "lay low" for a
few weeks.

The activities concerning this "contract" proceeded
to the point of securing the gun through ALEX CAMARATA by the
informant. Prompt and vigorous countermeasures were instituted
and as a result the "contract" was cancelled by FIGLIA on
February 7, 1967. °

On October 25, 1966, SFT-7 advised that in a conver-
sation with JOHN MISURACA the preceding Tuesday and Thursday,
nothing specific was mentioned regarding the HAROLD SMITH
matter with the exception that MISURACA indicated that they
were no longer concerned with the money involved in the
HAROLD SMITH matter because it was a paltry amount, but that
MISURACA was going to handle it and the informant would be
left free and clear as far as it was concerned,

Concerning the HAROLD SMITH matter, JOHN MISURACA
was interviewed regarding it on November 1, 1966, and MANNY
FIGLIA and JOSEPH CERRITO were interviewed concerning it on
November 2, 1966. All three individuals declined any comment re-
garding the same and JOSEPH MISURACA denied being acquainted with
MANNY FIGLIA or JOSEPH CERRITO, even after being advised he had
been observed with them previously and likewise JOSEPH CERRITO
any MANNY FIGLIA denied comment regarding any knowledge they.
may have regarding JOHN MISURACA.

. All three were aggressively told the FBI was aware
of their plans in the Reno, Nevada area and no trouble was
wanted in this regard and told that their actions would be.
closely. followed in the future. None of the three commented
regarding this, all of them denying knowledge of this matter
or any. involvement in the. LCN activities...

On November 7, 1966, SFT~7 advised he had been tele-
phonically contacted by JOHN MISURACA on November 2, 1966, who
requested him to visit him at ALEX CAMARATA's residence. He
visited MISURACA as requested at which time he reported being
interviewed by the FBI regarding the HAROLD SMITH matter and JOHN
MISURACA indicated at that time that he also had been inter-
viewed as had JOSEPH CERRITO and MANNY FIGLIA. He further

advised that ALEX CAMARATA was present during the first part

of his conversation, and became so infuriated that MISURACA
told him to leave the room during the latter part of the
conversation which he did. He advised MISURACA was extremely
upset by the interview conducted by the FBI and indicated he
may cut his visit short in this area, and was concerned how
the FBI knew so much about this matter.

SFT-1 on November 7, 1966, stated MISURACA has been
so upset that he has not left the house since the interview and
has complained repeatedly to CAMARATA that there were always
two FBI cars in. the neighborhood. He advised that CAMARATA
indicated that JOHN. MISURACA stated that there is nothing that
they can do at the present time, and that he was going to have
