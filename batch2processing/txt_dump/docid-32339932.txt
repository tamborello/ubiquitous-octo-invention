no possibility that he could obtain this photograph,
He said this was an official photograph forwarded to
NY from headquarters in Moscow, and said that he did
not know in whose custody this photograph was at the
present time, Informant said, however, that it would
certainly be in the custody of one of the officials of
KGB in the NY Residency, and presumed that either
GABELKO, TITOV or Colonel BORIS IVANOV would have it. He thought
it most likely that TITOV had it. -
. At this time informant again casually
inspected the 3 photographs of YURI NOSENKO, which
had been shown to him on a previous occasion by
interviewing agents. Informant studied the photographs
for several minutes, and then stated that one of these
3 photographs bore a faint, vague similarity to the
photograph of NOSENKO which had been shown to him by
GABELKO and TITOV. .Informant commented that the photo~
graph of NOSENKO, as shown to him by his KGB compatriots,
appeared to be a very old photograph, and informant noted -
that upon looking at NOSENKO's picture, when GABELKO h
handed it to him, he was struck by the vague similarity
in appearance between NOSENKO and Colonel VIKTOR TITOV.
