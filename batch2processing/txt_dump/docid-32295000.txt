SUBJECT: United States v. Joseph Bonanno, et al.

 

’ The Attorney in charge of the subject case has been
. attempting to obtain copies of the flight manifest records
( for Mohawk Airlines' flights from Newark, New Jersey, to |
Binghamton, New York on November 1), 1957. He is particularly
_ interested in the morning and early afternoon flights.

| oct at 1959

  

4n official of the Airline has advised that the records
for that day have been lost or destroyed. The same official
has expressed the belief that these records were examined by
Bureau agents. In the event that this is so and copies of these
manifests are in the possession of the Bureau, we should like to
have them for use at the trial.

In addition, if the Bureau has any other copies of
flight manifests pertaining to the Apalachin gathering, we
would appreciate receiving them. This would include Trafficant's
flight from Miami, Larocca's and Genovese's flight from Pitts-
3 burgh and De Simone's and -Scozzari's flight from Los Angeles.

4n attempt is also being made to locate the originals
& or copies of records of the Hotel Frederick, Endicott, New York,
for November 13 and 1h, 1957. The New York State Police advise
. they did not take the originals or obtain copies of them. [If
copies have been obtained by the Bureau, we would appreciate i
‘receiving then. i
