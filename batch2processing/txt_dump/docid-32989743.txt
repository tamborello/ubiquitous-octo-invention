Honorable Louis Stokes

Note: By request dated 1/26/78, the HSCA was provided

all retrievable information regarding Oliver Patterson,

a former source of our St. Louis Division. Patterson
provided a signed waiver authorizing release of his files.
The release included the enclosed document in its rela-
tively unsanitized version. This document is not known to
have been released to the public domain through FOIA or any
other litigation proceedings. The document and related
correspondence were subsequently provided to Mr. Quinlan
Shea, Jr., Director, Office of Privacy and Appeals,
Department of Justice, by one Harold Weisberg, who was
characterized within. It is noted that the three items of
related correspondence provided by Weisberg represent
correspondence between Weisberg and G. Robert Blakey, Chief
Counsel, -HSCA, relating to Weisburg's contacts with
Patterson. Mr. Shea provided the documents to the
Congressional Inquiry Unit, Records Management Division,
for appropriate action. This letter to the Honorable Louis
Stokes, Chairman of HSCA, satisfies same. The Xeroxing of
all items are the best available copies.

Item VII of the Memorandum of Understanding requires
that the HSCA notify the Attorney General of its intention
to disclose information which may tend to identify FBI
informants, potential informants or confidential sources.
The document in question is sensitive because it is a report
from a former FBI informant, contains FBI insight and method
of investigating a white hate organization and involves the
privacy rights of numerous individuals named therein.

OSBORN told the reporter that the warrants for
TURLEY and HAYNES were outstanding since June, 1970, shortly
after the bank robbery and that Sheriff HAROLD SULGROVE
called him and told him he was bringing TURLEY back on the
warrant and that DUNCAN did not push TURLEY's investigation
and did not push for his trial in state court. OSBORN
said that he thought that the witnesses probably were not
too positive at the time of the bank robbery since the
subjects had on nylon stockings, but after seeing them in
person were positive. He asked the reporter if he had seen
the good showup photograph that was taken both with the
nylon stockings and without and the reporter advised that he

ad not.

 

 

 

OSBORN was asked by the reporter what he thought
about the House Select Committee on Assassinations petition
to the Governor of Missouri for a pardon for TURLEY. He
responded that he had not heard of any pardon motion.

 

 

. On 11/7/78 Mrs. RUBY MAY HAMLETT, Vice President,
Laddonia State Bank, Laddonia, Mo., advised that St. Louis
Post Dispatch reporter, BILL FREIGOVEL called her saying
he was doing an article on the bank robbery of the Laddonia
State Bank in 1970. Since Mrs. HAMLETT's husband, State
Representative RAY HAMLETT, was running for re-election the
same day, she asked if this was not political and he advised
that the story would not be released until after the election.

 

She was asked by FREIGOVEL to comment on the fact
that when she was interviewed by SA DUNCAN the day of the bank
robbery she said one thing about who took the money and then
when she testified in State court she said something else. She
advised that the reporter was to call her back but did not.

Both OSBORN and HAMLETT said that the reporter
was allegedly reading from the court transcript of the trial.

For information of the Bureau, SA WILLIAM R. DUNCAN
was interviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations
staff on 11/21/77 and 11/29/77 and testified before the
subcommittee on 11/30/77 concerning an incident alleged to
have happened at the Louisville, Kentucky PD during September,

Further it is to be noted that the St. Louis
Division presently has a Federal parole violator warrant for

CLARENCE EDGAR HAYNES.

The above is being furnished to the Bureau for
information purposes.

The St. Louis file on the Laddonia bank robbery

has been destroyed under the Bureau's file destruction
policy and is therefore not available.

LARRY RAY and his brother, JERRY WILLIAM RAY, who were
suspects in robberies of the Farmers Bank of Liberty, Liberty,
Ill., on 10/17/69 and Farmers and Traders Bank of Meredosia,
Meredosia, I1l., on 1/28/70. Photos of the group of RAY
associates were brought to the bank by Agents from St. Louis
and witnesses from outside the bank the day before the robbery
and witnesses involved in the robbery identified photographs
of TURLEY and HAYNES. Federal process was obtained. HAYNES
was arrested in St. Louis a day or so after the robbery

and marked money from the robbery was recovered on his

person. TURLEY was arrested in St. Louis a week or so later
and no money was recovered. A showup was held at St. Louis
PD for witnesses from all three robberies. There witnesses
picked HAYNES as being the person who ran the bank robbery
but were not as positive on TURLEY. One witness from the
Meredosia bank robbery picked the photograph of TURLEY as
being the tall bank robber and HAYNES as being the short

bank robber.

Both subjects TURLEY and HAYNES were being tried
in USDC, St. Louis, during November, 1970. During the trial
HAYNES changed his plea from not guilty to guilty and
testified for the government. He testified TURLEY was with
him but he would not name the other participants until the
judge directed him to. He named his associates as JOHN
LARRY RAY, JAMES RUSSELL TURLEY, JAMES RUSSELL ROGERS, and
ERNEST TURLEY. At the end of the trial TURLEY was acquitted.

Audrain County Sheriff HAROLD SULGROVE, now deceased,
had state robbery warrants for both subjects with him. The
warrants had been issued shortly after the bank robbery.

After the acquittal of TURLEY he called Prosecuting Attorney
THOMAS I. OSBORN at Mexico and asked him if he could bring
TURLEY back for trial. OSBORN told him to bring him back
but he would discuss the prosecution later.

TURLEY's lawyer called OSBORN and he also talked

to AUSA KENNETH R. HEINEMAN who tried TURLEY in USDC and
OSBORN decided that he would tell the defense attorney that

if TURLEY would take a polygraph examination and pass he

would not try TURLEY, however, if TURLEY would refuse to

take the examination he would have to try him. OSBORN .
advised the defense attorney that with TURLEY's record and the
eye witnesses he thought that he owed it to the state to

try TURLEY.

  

TURLEY ‘appealed the fact that he was being tried
after being acquitted in Federal court to the Missouri Court
of Appeals, U. S. Court of Appeals, and the U. S. Supreme
Court. The Court of Appeals denied his appeal and the
Supreme Court would not hear the case. He was later ordered
for trial on a change of venue in Warren County Circuit
Court in Warrenton, Mo.

While out on bond and awaiting the court decisions
Audrain County Sheriff SULGROVE was in one of the St. Louis
City police precincts when TURLEY and his wife were brought
in for some violation. His wife said "I lied for you one
time but I'm not going to lie for you again.” During the
subsequent trial in Warren County Circuit Court SULGROVE

remembered this and got the detective to testify who had
this information.

TURLEY was tried, convicted and sentenced to 30
years in the state penitentiary. While awaiting transportation
to the state penitentiary he escaped from the Warren County

Jail and was later apprehended on a UFAP warrant in Florida
by FBI Agents.

On 11/7/78 former Prosecuting Attorney THOMAS I.
OSBORN, Mexico, Mo., advised that he got a telephone call
from a reporter, BILL FREIGOVEL of the St. Louis Post Dispatch
newspaper, saying he was doing a story on the bank robbery
at Laddonia in 1970. He advised that the House Select :
Committee on Assassinations investigators had information .
from JAMES RUSSELL ROGERS and CLARENCE EDGAR HAYNES ;
that ERNEST TURLEY was not involved in the robbery.
OSBORN was asked a number of questions about the case
and including why witnesses, when interviewed by
SA WILLIAM R. DUNCAN, Resident Agent handling the investigation,
were not too positive of an identification but when they
went to trial their identification was very positive. He
also wanted to know if DUNCAN called OSBORN after TURLEY's
acquittal in St. Louis and requested that he be brought back
for state prosecution. He also asked if it was not DUNCAN
who pushed the state prosecution.
