Purine fhe evening of 5/18/61, (______], Proprietor of [} OTHER 4
Confectionary Store, 956- -5th Ave., New kensington, Pav,

was interviewed for three hours in Monroeville, Pa., by SA THOMAS

G. FORSYTH, III, and among other things, L_ ]advisea:

 

His father, es operated the confectionery from
approximately 1925 antil his death in 1952 as a numbers-horse
book-sports betting station. His father cooperated with the
MANNARINOs but was never part of their organization. This was
tolerated by SAM MANNARINO because he had grown up with WILFRED

BURGART and was personally fond of him. WILFRED BURGART was the

only "independent" allowed to operate in a fashion where he banked

his own "play" and only contacted the MANNARINOs to "lay off." iM

 

 

 

 

‘When the elder BURGART died in 1952, [7] took over his/ |
; business, both legal and illegal, and has operated until the
recent past much in the same fashion his father had done. About t
two years ago, SAM MANNARINO went into semi-retirement and has bs
almost nothing to do with.the rackets, leaving this field to his a
brother, GABRIEL MANNARINO, known ‘to [Jas KELLY MANNARINO. | &

When KELLY became fully aware of the aioe eee PSY
lucrative wagering business, he felt that should be
"pulled into line" with the other small operators in the New
Kensington area and forced to become a low-level part of the
nization by turning in all wagers to MANNARINO éeéLlectors.

has consistently refused, with the result that KELLY

asingly annoyed and lately has been trying to steal
BURGART's long-time customers. He has done _this through threats
of physical harm, by spreading rumors that Lid is not
financially able to pay.. by attempting to have New
Kensington police harass This latter move has been
unsuccessful because of [__'s close friendship with Mayor
RAYMOND GARDLOCK. On the other hand, the other methods used
by KELLY MANNARINO have been more successful, and—____]'s
pusiness has suffered a loss of almost one-half.

Because of the above, is willing to assist the FBI in

any fashion, except that he is insistent that he will never, under
any circumstances, testify at any sort of proceeding, local or
Federal. A PCI file will be opened concerning

on 5/19/61, PG 615-C advised SA FORSYTH as follows:

SAM MANNARINO has fixed up a room in the basement of the Bonfire
Restaurant, near Leechburg, Pa., which looks as though it could
be used as a meeting place. Informant will submit a drawing of
this room and its relation to other parts of the building.

GABRIEL MANNARINO has acquired a mated pair of Doberman Pinscher
dogs, along with two puppies. The @der dogs have been trained
as "attack dogs." The price of the dogs is rumored to be in
excess of $2,000. .

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
