FRANK DESIMONE, Los Angeles; CARLOS MARCELLO, New Orleans.
Based om recent developments, it appears that JOE IANNI

is in the probable position of "underboss" to CIVELLO in
the Dallas "Family". As noted in the report, IANNI is
possibly related to the PELLEGRINO family of New York,
ROCCO PELLEGRINO having been identified as a member,

IANNI has been in touch with PETER PELLEGRINO, a son of ;
ROCCO, in the recent past and was reportedly involved : '
with PETER's attempts to'set up a bookmaking operation ‘
in Dallas several years ago, The PELLEGRINOs are also ;
well known to CIVELLO. . : : i

A number of CIVELLO's associates, as well as
CIVELLO, migrated to the Dallas area years ago from the
Baton Rouge - New Orleans, Louisiana, area, Study of
previous information received from the Bureau of Narcotics
shows that CIVELLO clearly had his conmections in the nar=
cotic traffic out of New Orleans, There has been no:
indication that CIVELLO has been involved with narcotics
Since his release from the Federal penitentiary in the
early 1940's, yet he still maintains contact apparently
with prior contacts he established while involved with
narcotics. :

With regard to DL 105-C, Dallas is of the view
that this informant has probably furnished the most accurate
information available as to the early existence of the
family in Dallas, In order to understand why he knows,
it should be born in mind that informant’s father was a
close associate of the group he identifies, was involved
in the same criminal activities, and after making “his
money", went legitimate and became a bondsman, where he
continued to have close contacts with members of the same
group. This informant is not active at this time, although
a current effort is being made to induce him to cooperate,
Through other informants in position to know, it has been
determined that DL 105-C is extremely close to CIVELLO and
his group.

The Bureau is aware of efforts by the Dallas Office
of prodding IRS into raiding BOSCO’s operation, due to added
complication that Detective SANSONE was involved and IRS and
Dallas Police Department were doing nothing about it. This :
was reported to the Bureau in the BOSCO case by airtel dated i
12/6/66. :
