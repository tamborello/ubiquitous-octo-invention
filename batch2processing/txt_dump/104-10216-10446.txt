3. Esabel Becquer, Eduardo Suarez, and Valentin Sanchez all spoke
wut in support cf Pric zs the President of the Exile Govern-
ment. They had urged a group consisting of Orlando Manrique,
Orlando Puente, David Cabezas, and Rafael Guas to support the
proposal. Suarez stressed that now is the opportune moment to

: carry out the campaign to form a Government in Exile since he

} has been informed by “reliable sources" that “the Americans"

' are withdrawing support of all Cuban exile groups. Emilio

i Nénez, Sergio Carbo, and Nestor Carbonell .all spoke of the

be need to unite all Cubans and to form a fighting front with or

1

i

"ogame

without "the Americans." :
4. Dr. Enrique Huertas, the last speaker, opposed the idea of

appointing Prio as President of the Government in Exile.

Huertas said the meeting had not been called for that purpose,

the persons attending the meeting had not had time to exchange

thoughts on the proposal, and they did not represent all pro-

ponents of a government in exile. After various debates, it

was agreed that two Commissions should be appointed as follows:

the first would write a manifesto explaining to the Cuban

exiles the importance of an exile government and ask for

support from all Cubans. The members of this Commission are

Sergio Carbo, Eduardo Suarez, and Rafael Guas. The second

commission was named the "Organizing Commission" and includes

Prio, Isabel Becquer, Juan M. Salvat, Huertas, Carlos Marquez,

Oscar Gans,, Ramon Martin, and Alfredo Gonzalez. It was also

agreed to offer Juanita Castro Ruz a position on this Commission.

5. A meeting of the Organizing Commission was held on 15 March
: 1965 in. the home of Alfredo Gonzalez at 2300 N.W. 10th
- ; Street, Miami. All members of the Commission attended except
Gans and Marquez who were out of town, and Salvat who evidently
does not agree with the group's proposed action. A document
prepared and approved by the group probably will not be
issued in the immediate future because Salvat informed Prio
that he would not sign it. .
