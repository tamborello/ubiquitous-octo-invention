is maintained by the CIA at Langley, Virginia headquarters
and he thinks it was on the second floor in corridor "H."
The fact that the contact report was out of New York was
not significant because the report could have originated

in Moscow and was rerouted and rewritten in New York, again
to conceal the point of origin.

He also told me that it was his experience that some-
times the Agency, when they want to surface material in the
"overt" side of the CIA, will say that it came from that side
when in fact it did not.

Deneslya said that it was also his information that the
Russians sent over "dispatched" agents from time to time.

He recalls that at one time there was discussion of an agent
who was caught because the Russians stamped his passport
twice at different pages with the same stamp but with a dif~
ferent date and this game him away. He did not recall the
agent's name.

Deneslya said that the Committee should determine who
made out the #201 on Oswald--who opened it and what division
they were in. He said that about a year after he gave testi-
mony before the Senate Intelligence Committee (1975) he saw
a report in the newspapers that someone in the ‘CIA had recom-
mended that Lee Harvey Oswald be contacted.

Donald gave the writer a written authorization to in-

spect his Senate Intelligence Committee testimony.

From February to July 1963, Golitsin went to England to
advise the British on the extent of Philby's damage. Deneslya
says that when he returned to this country the attitude of
some people in the SR Division had changed towards Golitsin.
He detected a hostility towards Golitsin which had not been
there before.

When Donald first came into the CIA he worked in the
Foreign Documents Division. Among the various types of re-
ports which came across his desk were "contact" reports
which filtered in from the many contact divisions which
the Agency had around the world. One.in particular caught
his eye, circa July-August 1963. It concerned an American
re-defector, a Marine, who would be returning to the United
States "with his family." This ex-Marine had worked in
Minsk.in a radio factory. The report, which Deneslya says
came out of New York City, did not mention this defector
by name. This, in itself, was not unusual because. the: ‘Con-
tact Division liked to conceal sources. He said the report
identified this person as a former Marine "cpl." or "cpt.",
which Deneslya felt could mean corporal or captain. He
was certain they were talking about Lee Oswald.

Deneslya said we could find this report probably in
the Industrial Registry for the radio factory in Minsk. He

said there was only one radio factory in Minsk. This Registry

the functions of Golitsin in Moscow had’ been the reading
of high-level American Intelligence Reports which convinced
him that there was a "mole" in .the CIA, but he could not
identify this person by name. While he was working for
Golitsin,. Golitsin dictated a long letter describing the
deficiencies in Western Intelligence agenéies' which he was
going to give to Robert Kennedy. It was Golitsin's feeling

that the Soviets were winning the Intelligence War.

 

Golitsin's principal handler was a Colonel Leonard

Weigner, a foreign-born agent whose parents had come out of
Russia through Mancuria. Weigner had been in Air Force
Intelligence. He became involved in the Pirigov case in
1948-49, This involved a Russian MIG pilot who defected and
brought his plane intact to the West. Weigner seemed to
get along very well with Golitsin. Others who knew him at
the time were Howard Osborne, now retired;| st Dave
Murphy (after 1963); John McMahon, a side-kick to Weigner
out of SR-CI and Tennent Bagley, aka "Pete" Bagley, who was

head of Counter Intelligence in the Soviet Russia Division.

 

He also mentioned a Deputy to Bagley in SR.

In November 1962 Donald received a strange request
from Golitsin. Rudolf Nureyev was appearing in Chicago, I1l-
linois and there was an ad in the paper that tickets were
available at a certain bookstore. He wanted Deneslya to
contact the store and find out where Nureyev was staying. .
Deneslya had heard that the KGB was planning to kidnap or
kill Nureyev.

Deneslya told the writer that a Charles Bohr, a
CIA doctor, was the case officer on Golitsin. Bohr was a
psychiatrist. Deneslya said that he never heard anyone
even remotely suggest that Golitsin was "paranoid" until
he heard about the testimony of ex-CIA officer John Hart
before HSCA. .It was his feeling that in 1963 the Agency
had great respect for Golitsin because of the information
which he was providing. There were times when they would

_gét exasperated with him because he would sometimes go over
the heads of the people he was dealing with ‘if he didn't
think they were reacting to his information: Golitsin was
apprehensive about Soviet world intentions and made no bones
about it. He knew how widely the Soviets had penetrated
other intelligence agencies. He told us about Felfe (ph.)
and Klemens who had penetrated the Gehlen Organization of
West German Intelligence which was the same as penetrating

the CIA because the Gehlen group was an extension. of CIA.

The CIA

 

 

had told him that he could write a book.

‘ It was Donald's feeling that Golitsin: was.a very
intelligent defector. His knowledge of leaks from Western
Intelligence sources was phenomenal. He turned up traitors

in many Western countries, including but not limited to:

 

 

 

 

and gave the CIA information which

 

 

led to the unmasking of "Kim" Philby, then the number two
man in British Intelligence, as a Soviet agent. Donald said
that Golitsin had been stationed in Vienna in 1954 and then
brought back to the Soviet and placed in the section of So-
viet (KGB) Intelligence which dealt with America and the
Western countries. In this capacity he was able to read

the material which these traitors. had been sending to the
Soviet side. He had an incredible memory. and had been plan-
ning to "come over" to our side for some time so he prepped

himself on things which would be to our interest to know.

 

He defected in 1961 in Helsinki. went over

 

to Helsinki to bring him back to the United States. One of
