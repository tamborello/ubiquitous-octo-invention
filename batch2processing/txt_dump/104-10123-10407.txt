40,

From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord,
Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy, of the Technical Division,
Office of Security, spent many off-duty hours in experimentation with
various items of equipment in an effort to improve and strengthen the .
Agency's Audio-C “termezsures Program.z4{They conceived and developed ©
a unique techr’” 4n which is considered to be
a major breakthruagh i the detection of cTandestine microphones and
other devices targeted against oft Agency. It gives the Agency for 24

he first time the capability to |
a capability for which thé’intelligence community has expended

large’ sums of money to develop in a variety of approaches. This tech--
nique will not only benefit the security of all Agency installations:
at home and abroad, but will be of utmost benefit to other agencies

in the community. This technique was met with wide acclaim by the
intelligence community and the Technical Security Countermeasures

Committee.

contributed significantly to the future clandestine use of this

Agency for the first time a procedure through which large in-

rapidly scanned in “real time" in the search for hostile tech-
nical penetrations. This capability will significantly enhance
the security of all Agency installations. .
