; The above reference to MOE is obviously a reference
to Chicago top hoodlum SAM GIANCANA, the boss of the Chicago

‘group. Obviously when contacted CERONE attempted to put these

individuals in touch with GIANCANA as the boss. Then when
unable to contact GIANCANA, FERRARO being "next man" or the
underboss, CERONE then placed the problem in with FERRARO,

The reference to Calumet City and to LA PORTE is
obviously a reference to Chicago top hoodlum FRANK LA PORTE
who is the organized hoodlum in charge of the area including
Calumet City, Illinois.

It is noted that when initially recéived the Chicago
Office interpreted the reference to JOE (ZERULLO) (Phonetic) as
being a reference to JOE ZITO inasmuch as the Chicago Office
was cognizant that ZITO was a hoodlum in the Rockford, Illinois,
area. However, in view of the above information received from
MI 623-CTE it is now apparent that the reference to JOE (ZERULLO)
was in actuality a reference to JOE ZAMMUTO, -This, then, would
confirm the information recently obtained from MI 623-CTE,
The reference to JASPER as being the underboss is obviously a
-yeference to JASPER CALO, CALO is a Rockford hoodlum who had
authority in Rockford until he recently returned to his native
Sicily. BUSCEMI , according to the information received from
MI 623-CTE, apparently has taken CALO'S place as the underboss
of Rockford. | : : oo .

The above telephone number checks out to a tavern
called George's. Place at 2733 North Halsted in the immediate
vicinity of Diversey and Halsted on the Near North Side of
Chicago. It is noted that the license listed to J. W. MARINELLI
is obviously for an automobile registered to Rockford hooldum
JOE MARINELLI, also known as "Gramps" and "Pops" MARINELLI, a
Rockford hoodlum. , ‘

It is of interest to note that FRANK FERRARO, being
the underboss of the Chicago group in 1960, was unaware of the
-identity of the boss and underboss in Rockford and had to request
information from CERONE, This would be an indication that there
is no close tie up between the Chicago group and the Rockford
group. ;

It would appear obvious that the information
provided by MI 623-CTE and the information obtained in
October, 1960, by CG 6343-C* are in consonance with each
other.
