Carlos Lechuga, Cuban UN ambassador, issued a statement
early on 23 November stating: "Despite the antagonisms exist-
ing between the Government of the United States and the Cuban
Revolution, we have received with profound displeasure the
news of the tragic death of President Kennedy. All civilized
men are always saddened by happenings such as this. Our
delegation before the United Nations desires to express that
this is the sentiment of the people and the Government of
Cuba." (UPI New York, 23 November, UNCLASSIFIED)

Cuban dispatched a message to
v shortly after President Kennedy's assassination
asking to "please send me at once all the data that

you have on Ly. Johnson including his political connec-
tions, ete." [~~ replied immediately: "biographical
data on Lyndon Johnson are in cable 24 of Prensa Latina
in UPI dispatch 169 and supplements." He also referred
to "Who is Who" which he had sent..the|--~~"" sd earlier
and said he will cable additional information later. (NSA

Che Guevara, in a speech on 24"November, expressed
apprehensions similar to those gtated by Fidel Castro the
night before. Guevara blamed President Kennedy's assassination
and the killing of Oswald on reactionary forces in the United
States and warned Cubans that a new, tougher policy against
Cuba will be forthcoming from the United States. “Everything
indicates that in the next months and years world peace will
be threatened by the most unscrupulous, ferocious, and warlike
monopolistic oligarchy--and with the most murderous potential

, --that the history of humanity has every known," Guevara said.

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

Fidel Castro's two-hour speech on 23 November was what
he termed an "objective analysis" of the implications of
President Kennedy's assassination. The speech reflected an
apprehension that US policy toward him may now become even
tougher. He said the President's death was “serious and bad
news" which could lead from "a bad situation to a worse situ-
ation."' He pointed out that President Kennedy's alleged
promise not to invade Cuba had been strongly attacked by those
“ultrareactionaries"” in the United States who, he said, are
now using the assassination to create a climate of "anti-
Soviet, anti-Cuban hysteria" designed to pressure the new
President toward a Cuban policy "highly prejudicial to. the
interests of peace and of mankind."

Castro began his speech by stating that he "and the
immense majority of human beings" react with "repudiation" to
the assassination, which is not "a correct method of struggle."
While the death of the imperialist system would make Cubans
happy, "the death of a man, even if that man were our enemy,
cannot make us happy...we must not confuse the systems with
the men." He said,"we always cease our belligerency at death;
we always bow’with respect at death, even if it has to do
with an enemy."

Castro declared that the assassination can only benefit
“those ultrarightist and ultrareactionary sectors, among which
President Kennedy could not be counted." These "most reaction—
ary forces are now breaking loose within the United States,"
he declared. President Kennedy was a strong president who
was able to control these pressures, but the new US president,
because of the circumstances inherent in his assumption of
the presidency, will not have the same strength and authority,
Castro said. _

Castro then read a series of US news dispatches referring
to the Castro-Communist affiliations of the accused assassin,
He said this was all part of the "reactionary" effort to
create a climate of "anti-Soviet, anti-Cuban hysteria" in
the United States. This climate of hysteria, he said, is
designed to face the new President with an irresistible pres~
sure toward a "more aggressive policy."

Castro then devoted considerable time in an attempt to
throw doubt on the guilt of the accused assassin and to in-
sinuate that Oswald, whether guilty or innocent, was actually
a tool of the extreme rightists. "Is he really guilty? Is
he a scapegoat? Is he a psychopath? Or is he perhaps a tool
of the most reactionary US circles? Who is this man?

Why did he go into action precisely when circumstances were
least favorable for a left-wing fanatic to assassinate the
US President?" Castro stated that his investigation of the
"reports, statements, and publicity" on the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee in the United States failed to indicate that
there was any chapter in Dallas or New Orleans and that "we
never in our life heard of him (Oswald), Castro then re-
ferred to US press reports on Oswald's attempt last summer to
"infiltrate" the anti-Castro Student Revolutionary Directorate
in the US and to DRE statements that Oswald was thought at
that time to be "an agent of the FBI or the CIA." "They

' (the DRE leaders) must know, because they have many dealings
with them, what FBI and CIA agents look like," Castro stated.

Castro then declared that, while Oswald may or may not

be guilty, it is nevertheless possible that he was "an agent
for the CIA or the FBI, as those people suspected" and could
have been "a tool of the most reactionary sectors which may
have been hatching a Sinister plan, which may have plotted
the assassination of Kennedy because they disagreed with his
international policy." "What is behind all this? What sinister
maneuver are they hatching behind all this? Who can be re=
sponsible for the assassination of President Kennedy? And who
benefits from the assassination...except the worst reaction-
aries?" Castro warned that it is not possible at this point
to answer these questions, "but we do say that it is suspect,
that.we must be cautious and vigilant and alert." Castro
closed with the usual expressions of confidence that the
Cubans will be ready to meet any new crisis with resolution.
