MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Charies Anderson
SUBJECT: Manolo RAY

1. Mr. John Crimmins called Mr. Samuel Halpern on
29 January and said that RAY is complicating the matter
of the export permit for his guns by raising the issue
of traasshipment to Venezuela via the Dominican Republic.
The ultimate consignee must show on all arms export
licenses. It will appear strange indeed if a license is
issued which shows the Dominican Government acting as
intermediary for the Venezuelan Government, wince there
are no relations between the two countries.

2. RAY should be apprised of this complication at
the first opportunity.
