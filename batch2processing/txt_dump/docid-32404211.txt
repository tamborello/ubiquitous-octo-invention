NOTE FOR: Distribution

SUBJECT: CIA‘s Response on JFK Board Actions

This action is the first we have received related to
decisions of the JFK Assassination Records Review Board.

I am assigning action on this subject to the Center for the
Study of Intelligence. The Center will work with components
to determine if the CIA should ask the President to object to
a JFK board decision. Components and the Center may
recommend what action, if any, the Agency should take to
appeal a JFK Board decision. The Center is responsible for
preparing the package that will be forwarded to the Director
(via the Executive Director and Deputy Director) for
decision. All component recommendations will be included in
such packages so the Director can assess all relevant
positions, factors, and arguments.

The suspense dates on these actions are extremely tight,
seven days for the Director to appeal a Board decision to the
President and 30 days (including the seven) for the President
to rule on an appeal. See the attached Lotus Note from Bob
Eatinger in OGC for more explanation of how appeals are to be
handled with the White House.

We may have to alter our procedures as we learn how best to
cope with this new requirement. Stay tuned.

\ Douglas fF. Garthoff
Executive Secretary
