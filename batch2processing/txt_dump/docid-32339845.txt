DIAZ and BALAN/were arrestéd because of their involvement with

ORLANDO BOSCH’s Cuban Power group in 1968 and are also close. -

associates of LESNIK and BOSCH.

Given the background of DOMINGUEZ in prior attempts’ to assassinate
political figures and his definite connection with BOSCH and
LESNIK (who have been named by other sources as having been in-
ivolved in the TORRIENTE homicide “behind the scenes"), it is

jthis writer's opinion that DOMINGUEZ should be looked at as a
suspect in the TORRIENTE case. ao
