know that. The American, in hardly recognizable Russian,
says. I did not know it then. I went to the Cuban Embassy
to ask them for my address, because they have it. The
Soviet says why don't you come again and leave your address
with us, it is not far from the Cuban Embassy. The American
says I'll be there yight away.

prejudice United States Government freedom of action on the
entire question of Cuban responsibility. With full regard —
for Mexican interests, Headquarters requests the Station to

Silvia DURAN was arrested at home with her husband and
members of the family who were having a party. All were

taken to jail. Since she had told not only her husband but

other members of the family about OSWALD's ‘visits after she
read the name and saw his picture on television, she attribu-
ted her arrest to a denounciation by a cousin whom she does
not like. The Station then indicates that the source of the
Mexican Government's knowledge (of her contact with OSWALD)
has not been revealed to her.

Silvia DURAN was again visited at the Cuban Embassy in
Mexico City by the American seeking a Cuban transit visa.
Mrs. DURAN contacted at least two members of the Soviet Embassy

and facilitated a direct conversation between one of the So-

‘viets and the American. Conversing in poor Russian, the Am-

erican stated that he already had been to the Soviet Consu-
late and had left an address. The Soviet official replied
that he was aware of that. The American suggested that he
had not known his address then, and he had gone to the Cuban
Embassy to ask for the address, because they had it. The

American then acceded to the Soviet official's invitation to

‘come by and give them the address.

28 September 1963 :
At 1151 hours (Mexico time) on Saturday, 28 September
1963., Silvia DURAN calls the USSR Embassy and talks to an
unidentified Soviet. She says that in the) Cuban Embassy
there if a North American who was at the Soviet Embassy. The
Soviet says wait a minute. Silvia DURAN speaks English with
someone - and comments in Spanish that they gave APARICIO
telephone number 14-12-99 and to take the number down - Silvia
DURAN then says the American citizen is going to talk with
you, i.e., the Soviet. The American first speaks Russian and
the Soviet speaks English. They continue in English. The
American talks broken Russian and says I was in your Embassy

;
and spoke to your Consul. Just a minute. ,A Soviet takes

the phone and asks the American in English’ what does he want.

' The American says please speak Russian. The Russian says

what else do you want? The American says. I was just now at

American showed papers from the Consulate in Washington,
that he wants to gotto the Soviet Union and be there for
a long time with. his wife, who is Russian, but the answer
has not come from Washington in respect to this problem,
and according to this procedure it takes four to five
months, but without permission from the Soviet Union they
should ask, or better said, they cannot issue a visa there
without asking Washington. However, according to this man,
he showed a letter indicating he was a member of an organi-
zation in favor of Cuba and that the Cubans said that they
cannot issue a visa without his having a visa for the Soviet
Union, and now. he (the Soviet) does not know what. to do with
him (the American), because they have to wait for an answer
from Washington.

Silvia DURAN agrees the same problem exists with the
Cubans, that the problem with him (the Ametican) is that he

does not know anyone in Cuba and therefore'if that is true

‘it will be difficult for him to get a visa for Cuba, be-

cause he was thinking of processing his visa (for the Soviet
Union), because he knew it would require waiting a long time
for his visa to the Soviet Union while in Cuba, and from
there go to the Soviet Union. The Soviet daid the thing is
that if his wife right now were in Washington she would re-
ceive her visa right now, or permission, from the Soviet
Union, to return to her country, she is going to receive her
visa in Washington but having this visa, she could communicate
to any place this permission, for example here or any place
she could receive it (visa or permission), but right now they
do not have them. Silvia DURAN says certainly and they can-
not give a letter either because they do not know if the visa
will be approved. The Soviet says he cannot give a letter

or recommendation either because he does nt know him (the
American) and asks to be excused for bothering her. Silvia
says that's all right and. many thanks.

27 September 1963 :
In mid-afternoon, Silvia DURAN informed the Soviet

Embassy that a male American citizen had requested a visa
to transit Cuba on his way to the Soviet Union. She wan-
ted to know who the American had talked with at the Soviet
Consulate. Also, she indicated that the Cuban Consulate
could grant him the visa and arrange immigration details
if the concession 6£ a Soviet visa were assured.

27 September 1963 it
At 1605 hours (Mexico time) on Friday, 27 September

1963, Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national, a local employee

of the Cuban Embassy, Consular Section, a receptionist [sic]
speaks with an unknown male at the Soviet Embassy. Silvia
DURAN tells the man that the American citizen was there,

the one who wants a visa for Cuba on his way to the Soviet
Union, and he wants to know with whom he was talking there
because she (Silvia DURAN) had sent him to the Soviet Em-
bassy saying that if they accepted him and gave him a visa,
then the Cubans (Embassy) would also give him a visa without
further paper work, only advising immigration in Cuba. The
American, she says, wants to know with whom he had talked
there because he says he was told there would be no problem.
The man in the Soviet Embassy says to'wait a moment. A
different Soviet speaks, and Silvia DURAN explains the same

thing to him. This man says to leave a name and telephone

number and says he will call. back. Silvia DURAN gives the |

telephone number 11-28-47 (Cuban Consulate). She also takes
advantage of the conversation and stated she has moved and

wants to advise the Soviet Embassy of her change of address
so that she can receive the Soviet Embassy's bulletin. The

man says to call KOUKHARENKO to give her new address, then

he asks the name of the Consul or Cultural Attache. Silvia
DURAN says the name is Teresa PROENZA and the telephone num-
ber if 14-13-26. The man says thanks.

27 September 1963 :

Pursuant to her inquiry, Silvia DURAN received a con-
firmation from the Soviet Embassy that the American had been
to the USSR installation. He had shown them a letter from
the Soviet Consulate in Washington indicating that he had
been long awaiting a visa for himself and his wife to go to
the USSR. No answer had come from Washington; however, the
waiting period was sometimes four or five months. The Ameri-
can also had a letter attesting that he was a member of a
pro-Cuban organization but he had claimed that the Cubans
would not give him a visa unless he had atready received a
Russian visa. |

Although the American was still at the Cuban Consulate,
Silvia DURAN repeated that she could not give him a transit
visa unless a Soviet visa was forthcoming, notwithstanding
the American's wish to go to Cuba to wait there for his So-
viet visa. According to DURAN, the American knew no one in
Cuba and she intended to annotate appropriately the American's
card. The Soviet official echoed her statement that the
American was not known.

ceived 500 pesos monthly.

"In December 1961 she and her husband made a trip
to Havana by plane. They paid for their own tickets,

The Cultural Attache PROENZA never assigned her any
work outside the Embassy. She said that she had

know PROENZA before she had been coordinator for the
Institute since she was a good friend of Paul FLORES.
Guerrero, the husband of DURAN's sister-in-law, who
died about three and a half years ago. It was through
FLORES that DURAN met PROENZA.

"She stated that she has had her present ideology
for about five years, and that it is based on convic-
tion and studies. She said she had not belonged nor
does she belong to any student groups.

"DURAN indicated she was acquainted with the
Leninist Spactacus League (Liga Leninista Espartaco)
but that she is not in agreement with it, and that her
husband shares her opinion. They admire Jose REVUELTAS
as. awriter but not as a politician since they are in
disagreement with his book entitled "The Headless Pro-
letariat" (Proletariado sin Cabeza) in which he tries
to prove the inexistence of the Mexican Communist Party
(Partido Communista Mexicano, PCM) while it is obvious
that this party does/indeed exist, although it is dis-
organized. She said that she had not belonged to this
organization but that she is friendly with its leaders
such as Jose REVUELTAS and the two LIZALDES.

"She disclaimed membership in the PCM, and said
she had not tried to joon it because she was in disa-
greement with it except for its support of Cuba."

and the handling of visa applications which were for-
warded to the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs for

26 November 1962 : (Date of dissemination)

A usually reliable and sensitive source in Mexico
City reported that on 26 November 1962 Gladys LECHUGA,
wife of Carlos LECHUGA, Cuban Ambassador to the United
Nations, formerly Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, said that
she had received two letters from her husband in New York.
He asked for spparation and said that the person in whom
he is interested is Silvia T. de DURAN; that she is "of
his ideas" and was willing to go to Cuba. According to
source, Teresa PROENZA, Cultural Attache at the Cuban Em-
bassy in Mexico City said that DURAN had never been a
Marxist or a communist.

Another usually reliable source with good contacts in
the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City reported in November 1962
that LECHUGA and DURAN did have an affair. The Cuban Embassy
was aware of it, but efforts were made to keep it from be-
coming known.

Information from a source whose reliability: could not
be judged reported that LECHUGA had offered to marry DURAN,
a Mexican married woman, after divorcing his wife, since. she
(Silvia DURAN) was ready to accompany him to Cuba.
