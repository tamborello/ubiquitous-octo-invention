it
1. Subject is presently serving in (Panama in a Contract Agent status.
Ke has been disapproved by this Office for conversion to staff employment.
Subject was formerly a member of the Communist Party and worked for the FBI as
an informant.

2. Kr. Foley and Mir. Hall of the Internal Security Division, Department
of Justice, have been in contact with Colonel King, WH, and Kr. Houston, rela-
tive to testimony subject may give in court on the Eugene Dennis case. It was
agreed between Colonel King, Mr. Houston, and myself that subject's testimony
might very well involve this Agency if the defense counsel tried to inject into
the court record subject's employment with this Agency for the past several
-years. King advised that subject's cover is not very strong and the CIA re-
lationship might well be established in court. Subject would came under heavy
attack from the defense counsel in view of his having served as an informant
to the FBI.

3. It was agreed that Foley and Hall of “Justi will be contacted

and advised that.we will bring the subject from (Panama o the States for an
interview by Justice and the FBI.on this matter if they so desire, with the
request that they endeavor to find other witnesses who can provide the necessary
testimony without the necessity of calling this subject for court appearance.

If this is impossible, we must reconsider our position in light of the possible
insistence by Justice for subject's testimony.
