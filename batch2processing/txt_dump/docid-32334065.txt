Garden of Allah Motel, Miami Beach, were involved in a

revolutionary attempt against Haiti. BABOUN also said that

one Mr. DILLARD, who operates a lumber business, and who

has been trying to obtain a lumber contract through the

Haitian Government, has a relative who has been offered

$10,000.00 to. fly arms into Haiti. BABOUN also said that oo
his informant advised that the Haiti Revolution had a :
depot of arms and ammunition located some distance from .
Miami and arms worth $70,000.00 cached on an island between -'
Florida and Haiti.

On September 4, 1958, BABOUN recontacted the fh
, Miant Office and advised that his informant was HAROLD |
USSINIUS, a Haitian National, and that BUSSINIUS had ||
® turned to Haiti at BABOUN's expense.F- A vi

 

On August 29, 1958, BABOUN advised thet Miami
Office that one ROBERT GREEN contacted him and said he was
representing MEROLA and that if BABOUN wanted to deal S ;
with MEROLA to send word to GREEN, GREEN quoted MEROLA + i

this to mean that the Revolution will be successful.

DILLARD again stated that he wanted it understood
‘ that he,ied at no time, had any knowledge of any planned
revolution in Haiti and had no relatives who had been
approached to fly arms to Haiti. .

DILLARD stated that in his opinion, LOCASSIO,
NUNNALLY, and BUSSINIUS are nothing but "con men" who would
attempt to.make a dollar in any manner they could. He i
also said that even after financing the trip to Haiti
for BUSSINIUS and NUNNALLY, and after ascertaining they had
no timberland available to them, BUSSINIUS again approached
him in August, 1958, and tried to tell him he now had
timberland available if DILLARD was interested. DILLARD
said he told BUSSINIUS he wanted no further business
dealings with him.

 

; On September 4, 1958, RUDOLPH BABOUN, Haitian
Vice Consul, Miami, advised that HAROLD BUSSINIUS
was sent to Haiti by him and he did not know when
BUSSINIUS would return to the United States.

On September 8, 1958, BABOUN advised SAS .
TOBIAS E. MATTHEWS, JR. and CHARLES W. EDMISTON that he
now realized that LEONARD BIRD and DILLARD are not connected
with any planned revolution in Haiti and that he did not believe
all information furnished by BUSSINIUS was reliable. He
also said that he now recalled that he had met BIRD and
that BIRD was negotiating with the Haitian Government
in order to obtain a contract for constructing a housing
project in Haiti. :
