ADMINISTRATIVE

ALLEY was interviewed at the Chicago Office on
March 28, 1961, along the authorized line of approach. He
impressed interviewing agents as being a shy and rather nervous
individual. This appearance is generally consistent with the -
description of subject previously furnished by JOHN KENNETH
TURLEY and, therefore, it was not felt to have been brought
about entirely by the. interview. ; ae

ALLEY in volu ing information regarding his Ok
contacts with{ ABARCHALIN. 4 id he "guessed" the FBI would be

interested in these meefings. He definjggly made light of '
his association with [thel 30 et Embass, loyee and Likewise O@ :
scoffed at the thought that| ABARCHALINE'sPinterest in him could) ‘,

“hy

have been for more then purely social réasons. To further ,
illustrate this attitude on the part of ALLEY, when interviewing i,
agent attempted to have ALLEY be more specific regarding a :
particular meeting and the line of discussion, he stated he :
felt the matter had been fully discussed and toomuch was being’
made of what were merely social meet ings (6)

LLEY seemed to be sincere in his statgpent that_h
would be’ honored toffreceive correspondence from/the Soviet.{[S)
Taken in context however, this statement was beFieved only to
further illustrate his overall attitude toward the purpose of :
the interview.

; It was also noted that ALLEY's memoryywith regard to ;
places and approximate dates ‘of travel seemed most exceptional
in comparison wij his recollection of details of the meetings o|
with ABARCHALINE J) ;

Chicago feels that this interview was as intensive
as was warranted under the general line of approach and the
obvious attitude of ALLEY tow the interview. It is believed.
that with more time to think, YALLEY may be able to, better recall j
details regarding his meetingSwith [he Soviet (3) a . |
