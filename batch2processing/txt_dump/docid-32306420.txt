Re Los Angeles airtel 5/17/67.

LA 4367-C-TE, a friend of ED REID,Vauthor of the
soon to be published book, "Jungle, USA," contacted REID
telephonically on 5/26/67, and explained to him that SIDNEY
KORSHAK had reported that ED BECKER was trying to shake
down some of KORSHAK's friends for money to keep their names
out of the book.

 

The purpose of source was to discredit BECKER to
REID in order that the CARLOS MARCELLO incident would be X\ —
deleted from the book by REID. BECKER is obviously REID's
informant concerning reportedly informing Bureau Agents in
September, 1963, that CARLOS MARCELLO #iaS planning on killing
President KENNEDY.

REID did not commit himself as to deleting or
changing any passage of the book.

On 5/31/67 ,, source and SA GEORGE E. BLAND contacted

Mr. and Mrs. ED REID at. their residence, 5000 San Vicente
Boulevard, Los Angeles. Source again related KORSHAK's
statements concerning BECKER. It was again pointed out to
REID that BECKER had been interviewed by Bureau Agents
in November, 1962 concerning the BILLIE SOL ESTES case, but
| had not mentioned the reputed conversation or statements
allegedly made by MARCELLO on 9/11/63, (almost a year later)
at Churchill Farms, New Orkeans.

REID stated he would never publish anything to
discredit the Bureau or cause embarrassment to the Bureau.
Mrs. NANCY REID and then ED REID agreed that, that portion
of the manuscript concerning the Bureau would be deleted.

LA 4367-C-TE was most helpful in effecting the
desired objective. '
