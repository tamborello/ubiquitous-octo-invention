decisions will also release what was previously classified
foreign counterintelligence information.

(U) The documents concerning the decisions from the last
meeting, are listed below by document number with the information
to be released. The status of informants and sources, if found
through research, is noted after the name with living (L),
deceased (D), no record (NR), or date of birth (mm/dd/yyyy) .

(U) The FBI provided written justifications presenting
the evidence available to protect the individuals, singular
information, and classified information related to sources and
foreign relations as listed above. However, the ARRB supports
the position that the information ordered disclosed is relevant
and significant to the assassination. They opine the pertinence
and importance to the assassination outweigh any current harm to
the individuals or the FBI's/United States Government's foreign
relations, informants or operational aspects.

(U) The JFKTF will continue to advise CID, NSD and oGC of
the ARRB decisions. However, due to the narrowed scope of appeal
issues, NSD and CID recommendations will only be sought for
significant matters, none of which are documented in this
memorandum. If you have questions, please contact Karen S.
Robertson at extension 9587, Carol L. Keeley at extension 9494,
or Carl Valentine at extension 9476.

(U) 1. (15/170) LA 89-75-369, 124-10272-10231 releases
LA 4035-S (1896), his informant file number, and names in the

{U) 2. (16/61) WFO 89-75-359; 360, 124-10265-10448
releases the paragraph which contains the previously classified
phrases "obtained from the mail cover;" and "to protect the
source because it reveals investigative interest in a foreign
diplomatic establishment." In another paragraph, the ARRB
releases the phrase "is a mail cover on the Soviet Embassy."

; (U) 3. (16/63) SV 89-36-9, 124-10266-10001 releases the
names of PSI Jack Wells (D) and PCI Joseph Rastus Rider (D) and
the words "aka Rufus" and "Waynesboro." It is noted the ARRB

previously ordered release of the same two names in SV 89-36-15,
124-10266-10007.
