This report has been delayed due to the pre-
occupation of the preparing Special Agent with other
pressing matters in connection with the Criminal
Intelligence Program,

During the period of this report, close
liaison has been maintained with Intelligence Division,
IRS, Pittsburgh, Pa., which is currently conducting
an investigation regarding this subject:

By: airtel to the Bureau, 8/4/64, captioned,
"NY 3936-C," the New York Office set out the following
information:

Informant advised that he was attempting to
obtain a Teamster pension loan for the LEONE Brennen s a
Detroit through an individual named LENNY(CIFFONE. mach “Pee
stated that both the LEONE Brothers and CIFFONE are
controlled by racketeers. Informant advised that
CIFFONE advanced him $10,000 to facilitate the loan
and the informant did attempt to get this loan from
the Teamsters. He said that CIFFONE did not actually
get the loan and consulted a lawyer to secure the
return of his $10,000. Informant said that when he was
contacted by CIFFONE's lawyer, -he brought this matter PA Ms
to the attention of SALLYXCELEMBRINO and EDDY XANZIERRI AY
both of whom are subjects of criminal intelligence ;
investigations in the New York Office. CELEMBRINO told
him that he would go to Pittsburgh and attempt to get
this matter straightened out. Informant had mentioned
other matters to CELEMBRINO previously, which concerned
him and CELEBRINO had told him on two other occasions
that he would be leaving for Pittsburgh at 3:00 AM, on a
particular Friday morning to go to Pittsburgh. The
informant said that when he had mentioned his troubles on
previous occasions, and CELEMBRINO had told him he would
take the matter up in Pittsburgh, he did not believe him
and placed no importance on CELEMBRINO's statements.
He stated, however, that this time” CELEMBRINO invited him
to accompany CELEMBRINO and LANZIERRI to Pittsburen.

Informant advised that they departed from
downtown New York at 3:00 AM in a Cadillac owned by
ROCCOKDO CANDIA. CELEMBRINO, LANZIERRI and the informant
drové directly to New Kensington, Pa., to the home of —
JOEYROSA, arriving there at 10:50 “AM, on ‘July 31, 1964,

He “stated they drove into ROSA's garage and CELEMBRINO
breught him into the house where he met ROSA, his son, .
JOE, JR., and his daughter-in-law. About one-half hour ..
later GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO came to ROSA's house.

The informant met MANNARINO and was explaining the
Detroit loan situation to him when JO. ICA arrived Pa
at ROSA's house. MANNARINO indicated to the informant” ~~
that they would handle a settlement in this matter

and they were very upset with CIFFONE for the manner

in which he handled this deal, in that he hired a lawyer
to attempt to get his money back rather than go through
channels.

During the course of some small talk which
took plwe later, MANNARINO told the informant that he
had just arrived from "the farm" where he had stayed
two nights with RUSSELL BUFFALINO and LOUIS VOLPE.
MANNARINO said that BUFFALINO has a "kid" who is a
relative of his, and is attempting to gain admission to
the Pennsylvania Bar. This relative of BUFFALINO is
afraid he might be rejected by the Bar Association be-
cause he had some trouble in New York. MANNARINO
told the informant that a judge in New Kensington is
attempting to influence the Bar Association on behalf
of this relative of BUFFALINO.

Informant advised that at this time during
the course of the conversation, it became apparent that
SALLY CELEMBRINO was accepted by all of the individuals
there as an equal and a close associate, but that himself
and EDDY LANZIERRI were more or less treated as outsiders.
(It should be noted that SALLY CELEMBRINO has been
identified as a “captain” in the VITO GENOVESE "Family". )

At this time, JOHNNLA ROCCA arrived at ROSA's Pa
house with another individual whom the informant described Ppp yh
as a young man who controls jukeboxes, not in the Pittsburgh
area. Informant said LA ROCCA referred to this young man

On May 12, 1965, PG 704-C-TE advised
SA W.B. ANDERSON, JR., as follows:

Informant was asked to explain what the real --
reason was for MEYER SIGAL's refusal to give. evidence
against POSSINO. Informant said that he had previously
withheld this information from the contacting agent
because of its nature but things had reached the.
point now where he had to divulge it. He said that
Sonny eraNcurrT had come to see MEYER SIGAL
15 or’ '20 times on behalf. of the New Kensington
people who wanted to be sure SIGAL was not going to
talk about POSSINO. He said, in addition, KELLY .
MANNARINO had come to see SIGAL four or five times
himself. On each occasion, SIGAL told the informant
that MANNARINO had threatened him with harm if he
said anything at all about POSSINO. Informant said
that on the last occasion, which is about ten days
earlier, MANNARINO had, after leaving SIGAL, come
to the informant, stuck his finger in his chest and said,
"You see that that Jew bastard partner of yours
doesn't. unload on POSSINO or I'm going to put him
in one of his orange juice tanks." Informant said he
then. went back in and talked with SIGAL and from the
tone of SIGAL's conversation, SIGAL believed
MANNARINO and his threats.

i 4 e
Informant said that MEYE IGAL is well known feu

to KELLY MANNARINO, has known him for at least 25 years.
He said that at one time about 25 years ago, when MEYER
was getting started out in the numbers business, he worked

in a numbers office owned and controlled by KELLY MANNARINO.

Informant said that so far as MEYER SIGAL's
getting the "call" in 1962 from IRS employees about
IRS raids, he wanted to offer the suggestion that
two men, SKIPPY WOODS and MIKE SIMON, were splitting
their play between the SIGAL, PARROTTO, SARKIS book
and the TONY GROSSO book. He said these two men got

advance warning from GROSSO and passed the word on to

others. He thought this might be the source of

information that MEYER SIGAL had about IRS raids in 196

The physical surveillance at the Adrilee
Motel, North Huntingdon Township, Westmoreland County,
Pa., on 5/24/65, was conducted by SAS SAMUEL A.
MILLER and JOHN M. KIRSCH. :
