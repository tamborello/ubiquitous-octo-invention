PROJECTION (PHASE ID.

As a help towards the making of a U.S. decision on a future course
of action, the Operational Representatives developed working statements
of four possibilities; at my request they have commented on the positive
and negative factors worth considering for each possible course, and it
ig suggested that these thoughtful statements are worth reading in full.
The working staternents of the choices open to the U.S. are as follows:

a. Cancel operational plans; treat Cuba as a Bloc nation; protect
Hemisphere from it, or

b. Exert all possible diplomatic, economic, psychological, and
other pressures to overthrow the Castro-Commumnist regime without
overt employment of U.S. military, or

 

ce. Cormmit U.S. to help Cubans overthrow the Castro-Gommunist |
regime, with a step-by-step phasing to ensure success, including the use
of U.S. military force if required at the end, or

 

d. Usela provocation andiéverthrow the Castro-Communist
regime by Se military for

armatter of our own security, undertaking some economic proscription,
and isolating the Castro/Communist gang from contaminating the Hermnis-
phere. Along with recognition of our hurnanitarian sympathies, this seems
to be the fear among Cuban refugees, although they are still hopeful.

lf Cubans become convinced that the U.S. is not going to do more

than watch and talk, I believe they will make other plans for the future.
The bulk of Cuban refugees in the U.S. are most likely to start getting
serious about settling down for life in the U.S., dulling their desire to
return home with personal risk involved. The bulk of disaffected people ©

. inside Cuba will lose hope and incentive for futile protests against the regime
and start accepting their status as captives of the Communists. Some Cuban
activists will not accept the loss of their homeland so easily and may seek
telease from frustration by Liberation operations outside U.S. territory
and control. The recent wildcat Cuban scheme to bornb Habana from Central
America is an example.

 

) probes of the guerrilla potential inside Cuba have been hampered
by Witnilar morale factors, Cubans sent to risk their lives on missions
inside Cuba feel very much alone, except for their communications link

back to the U.S. They are unable to recruit freedom fighters agyressively
by the time-proven method of starting an active resistance and thus attractin:
reeruite; U.S. guidelines to keep this short of a revolt have rnade the inten-
tion behind the operation suspect to local Cubans. The evidence of some
intent is seen in the recent maritime re-supply of the team in Finar del Rio.
We brought in extra weapons, for which there were immediate recruits; if
we were to exploit the evident guerrilla potential in this province, ut appears
likely that we would have to furnish supplie* by air and probably open the

to strong charges of furnishing such support to Cuban resistance elements.

 

Therefore, we have been unable to surface the Cuban resistance
pote 1 to a point where we can measure it realistically. The only way
this can be done, accurately, is when resistance actually has a rallying
point of freedom fighters who appear to the Cuban people to have some
chance of winning, and that means at least an implication that the U.5. is
in support. Word-of-mouth information that such 2 freedom movement is
afoot could cause the majority of the Cuban people to choose sides. it |
would be the first real opportunity for them to do so since Castro and the
Communists came to power. There was little opportunity for the Cuban
people to joim an active resistance in April 1961; there is less opportunity
today. If the Cuban people are to feel they have a real opportunity, the
must have something which they can join with some belief in its success.

abotage has not taken place, on a U.S, ~sponsored basis.
Planning for“such action by CLA has been thorough, including detailed

Intervention Planning. The JCS were given the responsibility for
planning and undertaking essential preliminary actions for a decisive U.S,
capability for intervention in Cuba. This "Guidelines" objective has been
met, fully. Also, U.S. military readiness for intervention in Guba has
been under continuing review within Defense, being improved wherever
feasible. In addition, rumors during June of a possible uprising inside Guba
led to further planning for a contingency where a non-U.S. inspired revolt
might start inside Cuba; inter-agency staffing of U. S. planning for such a
.Guban contingency is being completed, under Defense leadership.

 

Assets. Whatever we decide to do in the future depends, to a
large degree, onthe assets available to us. Our own U.S. assets in organi-
zation, personnel, and equipment are sufficient to liberate Cuba, given the
decision to do so. Assets among the Cubans, to Liberate themselves, are
capable of a greater effectiveness once 2 fier decietor is made by the U.S.
to provide maximum support of Cubans to liberate Guba, and the Cubans .
start being helped towards that goal by the U.S. There are enough able-
bodied and properly motivated Cubans inside Cuba and in exile to do the job.
There ig wide-spread disaffection in Cuba, with strong indications that
economic distress and demoralization of population is causing teal concern
and strain for the regime's control officials. Firm U. S, intention to help
free Cuba is the key factor in assessing the Cubans themselves as an
operational asset for Operation Mongoose.

 

At the close of Phase I, my concern is strong that tirne is running
out for the U.S. to make a free choice on Cuba, based largely on what is
happening to the will of the Cuban people. Rightly or wrongly, the Cubans

"have looked and are looking to the U.S. for guidance on what to aspire to
and do next. They wonder if we are not merely watching Cuba closely, as

They are given open U.S. assistance to rermain in this country, yet

are participating in covert actions in a limited way. Only a fractional
opening has been made to release the frustrated energy of these refugees
in freeing their homeland and in creating a favorable political climate in
Latin America for the liberation of Cuba, Policy limitations of “audibility"
and "visibility" apply dirsctly in considering the handling and use of this
dynamic refugee potential,

As a working document for U.S. operational guidance, State
developed a definition of a political program for a free Cuba, with the
understanding that any real political program must be developed by the
Cubans themselves.

; Psychological, Psychological activities for Operation Mongoose
make use of existing assignments of responsibilities within the U. S.
government: State, having the policy role, chairs an inter-agency Cuba
Peychological Operations Group which meets weekly; USIA disseminates
any U.S. government information (VOA and Press Service) and generates
‘gray" or non-official information (5 million cartoon bookg,and thousands
of Spanish books on Cuba disseminated in Latin America)J CIA passes
information appropriate for "gray" and covert psychological channels
(radio, mailings to Cuba, and dissemination inside Cuba).

Conditions and events in Cuba have provided many effective themes,
which have been promptly and sharply exploited by available means in the
Western Hemisphere. However, the U.S. still lacks the capability of
effectively getting information to the majority of the Cuban people. Our
short-wave broadcasts are highly regarded by the Cuban people, but short-
wave receiver sets are limited inside Cuba. Our medium-wave broadcasts |
compete against stronger Cuban signals; it was felt that greater U.S. ;
competition in medium-wave broadcasts could lead to Cuban interjerence

the U.S. trade embargo, denial of bunkering facilities, increased port

trade negotiations in Israel, Jordan, Iran, Greece, and possibly Japan.
Under Resolution VII adopted at Punta del Este, the OAS has established
a special committee to study "the feasibility and desirability of extending
the suspension of trade with Guba to other items (than armd,"' State has
prepared a program to be submitted to this OAS cornmittee in the future.

The evidence in that Cuba's economy is suffering. Trade with the
Communist Bloc and others has kept it limping along, despite scarcity
of U.S. goods, the bad drought limiting agrarian crops, increased worker
neon-cooperation and the regime's bungling of economic control measures,
Critical spare parts still arrive in Cuba, including shipments from British
and Canadian firms. Chartered shipping from Free World sources still

outside has attracted recruits. Its potential has been estimated at about
250, which is a sizeable guerrilla force. With equally large guerrilla
forces in other Cuban provinces, guerrilla warfare could be activated

with a good chance of success, if assisted properly. However, the teams

in other provinces have not been 60 successful; our best hope is that we

will have viable tearns in all the potential resistance areas by early October.

ACCOMPLISHMENT

* Elements of the U.S. government were organized to reach the
goals set for Phase 1, My assessment of where we are on each
objective is noted under appropriate sub-headings below. In general,
this has been a remarkably quiet operation, well within the "noise"
and "visibility" limits imposed.

My assessment of the organization, planning, and actions to
reach the goals in Phase I:

 

Intelligence. CIA had the main assignment to acquire the
“hard-imtelligence" desired. The headquarters and field staff of CIA
are now well organized for a major effort for this aspect of Operation
Mongoose, being strengthened by a number of CIA officers experienced
in "denied area" operations elsewhere in the world. Planning and
actions rate superior, in a professional sense of intelligence collection.

plan to collect information on the target from third country @reas in
in America and Europe. Inside Cuba, the recruitment.and place-

ment of third country nationals and initiation of Cuban collection nets,

particularly in urban centers, has made Operation Mongoose numeri-

cally largest U.S. intelligence agent effort inside a Communist
state. ¥JHowever, the effort in more rermote provincial areas of Cuba,
wheapiluerrilla resistance was expected to be spotted, recruited,

and organized, was short of the hoped-for goal; this was due to the
regime's security precautions and, to some degree, to policy Hmita-
tions on the risks to be assurmed.

   
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
   
 
 
   
  

Defense contributed the majority of personnel to staff the
Caribbean Admission Center, stepped-up SIGINT collection under NSA
despite changes and improved sophistication of Cuban communication
procedures, and brought into play the available assets of Service intelli-
gence organizations, in coordination with CIA, State stepped up its
inforrnation collection from diplomatic and refugee organization sources.
Justice (FBI and INS) and USIA provided significant support to the
Caribbean Admission Center.

‘ecret

Political. State appointed a representative to devote full-time
to Operation Mongoose and to develep the required political actions.
During Phase I, the Punta del Este conference was a major U.S. political
action to isolate Castro and neutralize hig influence in the Hemisphere,
but was not developed within the context of Operation Mongoose. The
successful visit of President Kennedy to Mexico was another major U.S.
wolitinnl sation... with apoatential impact upon our special goals, but was
not developed within the context of Operation Mongoose. Two Operation
Mongoose efforts in political action were attermpted in Phase I: to
counter Castro-Communist propaganda exploitation of May Day and to
arouse strong Hemisphere reaction to Cuban military suppression of the
hunger demonstration at Cardenas, in June. Ambassadors in Latin America
were asked to undertake a special effort, as possible, with the help of their
Country Teams; political action results in both instances were mostly
nepative, due to lack of capability and the local attitude in Latin American
countries.

 

 

 

~

State is responsible for refugee political policy matters, assisted
by CIA in daily liasson. This is an area of major interest to Operation
Mongoose, since the Cuban refugees have an open objective of over-
throwing the Communist regime in Havana and recapturing their homeland.
