subsequently turned over the local operators. However, the establishment .

was also believed to be set up as a "lay off" spot for heavy bets .

| a PCI of the Pittsburgh Division of unknown
reliability, advised that the Arrow ‘Treasurer Ticket, a lottery,
cis back in full swing in the New Kensington area and in his

.- opinion the MANNARINOS are the force behind the sale of these tickets
“but the informant had no positive proof of this, In August of 1953
[_ Ireportea that SAM MANNARINO had returned to New Kensington

or good as his. business interests had been lost in the gambling

casino San Souci in Cuba, .

Mainly, through the efforts of the Westmoreland Ministerial Association
and its program called. "Operation Crusade" in the latter half of |

1952, a large amount of publicity was given to the corrupt conditions

| existing in New Kensington, and because of this most of the gambling

| activities were voluntarily curtailed. ‘During the same period it

was reported through several non~authorative sources that the MANNARINO
control in the area has been greatly lessened and that other factions
were ready to step in and operate when the town again opened up.

As has been reported it appears that New Kensington is again wide

open and it further appears that .the MANNARINO organization is still

in control of all gambling in operation even though the subject and ~

{ his brother GABRIEL MANNARINO spend a great deal of time out of the

| eity in Miami, Florida. .
