Concerning the specifi¢ information relating to

FS possible atgfack on a Cuban ship, vhich was received from

Legat, Ottawa] and contained in reButel 3/12/68, the nyo PY /
ould like to point out Kia % the possibility exists that “—*
ne letter circulated by Hancuanbta REVOLUCTONARIA CUBANA"

was originally dated Febr ry 28, 8. This letter was
furnished on 3/15/68 to CIA by Shanrey ROSS, Editor,

"EL TIEMPO", and it contained in essence a threat against

Cuban and Soviet bloc representatives together with a threat |
to attack Cuban ships. It is possible that this letter may
have fallen into the hands of CiS personnel and in turn, was
relayed to the Cuban Ambassador in Ottawa, Canada. It is

also possible that the individuals responsible for sending. '
this letter, now believed to be JOSE RAMON EGUES and his
associates, could very well have sent a Yetter to the Cuban
Mission to. the UN, to the UN or even to one of the Ministries

of the Cuban Government in Havana, Cuba. Jing) (XQ) u

[me NYO will remain constantly alert for the

possibility that the CIS has infiltrated the one] the MIRR A)
_ or other anti-CASTRO revolutionary organizations] The NYO _ ait

also contemplates interviewing JOSE RAMON EGUES vigorously

concerning his activities with "VANGUARDIA REVOLUCIONARIA

CUBAITA", uring this interview, the NYO will attempt to

determine Whether or not EGUES and his group had sent this

letter to any representative of the Cuban Government which

could be the explanation why the Cuban Government was in the

posséssion of the information indicating that the exiles were

planning to take some reciprocal action for the ramming of a

1ifeboat by the Cuban fresenter "JULY 26" off the coast of

Virginia in February, 1968. ] paeat(y( u)

The Bureau will be kept advised of all developments
in this matter.
