SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

 

2m eerummurmteremrenen ter = Laem ein

The Secret Army Organization (SAO) was clandestinely
formed during the Fall.of 1971 in Arizona. Membership to date
has been small and it appears to have the same basic tersts as.
the Minutemen. In fact, several of those involved in SAO
were formerly active in the Minutemen, The mail drop for
this organization reportedly is in care of an individual in
Ramona, California, who has been involved in Minutemen and
white-hate activities in the past.

This ultraconservative paramilitary organization
was recently invoived in extremist activities in San Diego,
California. Members of this group reportedly made threatening
telephone calls to a local college professor who is active
in a group which plans to organize demonstrations at the
forthcoming Republican National Convention, Following these
telephone calls, a member of SAO fired shots from an auto-
mobile into the professor's home, wounding a guest.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY
FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF-DEFENSE
CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION
EXTREMIST MATTER - BLACK PANTHER PARTY

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,
1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George
Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black
people to take control of the life, politics and destiny of
the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther
Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called
“The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the
use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program
to end the oppression of the black people but since early
1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.
BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-
munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the
U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders
have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling
for action within the established order. Newton, in an
interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"
magazine, stated the Panthers’ chief ambition is to change
the American Government by any means necessary but that
ultimately such change will be through armed violence.

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,
indicators of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist.
Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been arrested
in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,
murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of
Newton's tailor, Newton failed to appear on these charges and
is now a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and three

- were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored

dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974,
