Re: SAM BARON .“

ae Source was visited by SAM BARON, who is presently

in New york but is leaving shortly to take a job in Europe.

BARON told the source that sometime in the past he nad
spoken to WALTER SHERIDAN, Special Assistant to the AGs
and asked SHERIDAN to go easy with informant when he was
questioned in Nashville, since he (BARON) considered ;
informant "the only good thing in the Teamsters." Informant
said that he was questioned py SHERIDAN in Nashville, and
SHERIDAN requested him to furnish information concerning
HOFFA and to testify fully concerning the TBT. Source —
declined to cooperate and SHERIDAN then said, "We know you
are cooperative and are furnishing information. but I would
like you to furnish it directly to me since we are getting
the information late through Washington.” Informant said that
he received the definite impression from SHERIDAN from this
and other conversations that he knew source had been furnishing
information to this office.

Re’: varied ISS

Informant was visited by WEISS on 5/12/63.

WEISS brought with him an individual whom he introduced

as his younger brother put did not name. WEISS said he

was en route to visit with his brother in Connecticut.” LL f
He asked the source if he had received any THrometilow
that he (WEISS) was about to be indicted in Nashville.
Source said WEISS appeared very sick and nervous and was
taking pills during the short time they visited, Informant
told WEISS that he had read of the indictments returned and
assumed the Grand Jury would not return any further indict-
ments, WEISS stated he had received information that the
Grand Jury would reconvene and that he would be indicted
shortly thereafter. Tnformant attempted to learn the sairce
of WEISS! information but was unsuccessful. WEISS then left
without further discussion of any pertinent significance.

 

In view of the fact that informant is on the
road to recovery and intends resuming his duties for the
TBT on a limited basis within the nxt two weeks, informant
case file is being reopened.
