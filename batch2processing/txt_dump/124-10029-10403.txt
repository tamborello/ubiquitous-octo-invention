As shown in my memorandum of 12-13-77, the Bureau -
identified some of the materials in the KENNEDY investigation
which re released on 12-7-77 as those which apparently
attracKed the attention of at least one reporter from a
Mexican newspaper in Washington. Mr. ROBERT DUNN; the.
Ambassador's Assistant, was in Washington the following
weekend and brought back with him three separate sections

 

which had been furnished to him at the Bureau. These sections

represent the 524 page report of former SA WARREN C. DE
BRUEYS at Dallas on 12-8-63. One section, pages 315 ~- 359,
relates to the Mexican travel of LEE HARVEY OSWALD. To date,
there have been no articles of a sensational nature appearing
in the Mexican press based on this material.

- In addition, on 1-5-78, Ce ant
to this office a set of documenté which had been forwarded

by his Headquarters which appeared to represent raw Bureau
file material pertaining to the Mexican aspects of the OSWALD
investigation. At his suggestion, copies of th€s@documentsS
were made for temporary ion in the files of this office
and the set furnished by wes returned to him on 1-6-78.

 

 

For the time being, all of this material is being
placed in a Bulky Exhibit Envelope of captioned file so
_that it will be available for reference if needed.
