he is safe and well. According to RAND, the subject should
return to the United States about October 1, 1959, if he

| returns at the expiration of his present 20-day tour. The

| subject has in his possession his return air transportation
ticket to the United States. RAND stated that although the
subject is still on their payroll, upon his return to the

, United States he wouiid be terminated.

RAND said that the subject has no knowledge of
RAND's connections with the United States Air Force, and the
subject was not utilized by RAND in any intelligence capacity
whatsoever.

The current city directory for East Cleveland,
Ohio, reflects a ROBERT WEBSTER, wife MARTHA WEBSTER, residing
at 15321 Welton Drive. No employment is listed in this
i directory. On the basis of the information available as set
| out above, the Cleveland files reflect no reference identi-
fiable with the subject or MARTHA WEBSTER,

Due to the basis on which [—___lwes contacted OTHER 4
and in view of the current connection between the Rand :
Development Corporation and the United States Air Force, no

direct questioning concerning the subject was made on inter-
view with RAND and and information furnished by them
was merely accepted. any of the information as furnished
by RAND and | Jis disseminated outside the FBI, their
identities shou ecarefully concealed. The Cleveland
Division feels that further investigation of the subject is
| warranted; however, no specific recommendations are being made
| or leads set out at this time pending Bureau advice as to the
| scope of investigation desired. Since the subject is an i
employee of the Rand Development Corporation at the Moscow
Fair and due to the connection between the Rand Company and
the United States Air Force at this Fair, the Bureau_is
requested to advise Cleveland the scope of P further investi

ton they desire on the subject.
