ADMINISTRATIVE

Information copies are being sent to the offices
indicated inasmuch as they have conducted investigation in
this case in the past and in the future may have leads to
cover.

For over forty years subject has used the name
JOHN ROSSELLI. In 1936 he filed a report of birth in Chicago,
Illinois, in the name of JOHN ROSELLI. However, because he
has for many years spelled his name ROSSELLI this is the
spelling that will be used throughout this report, The
title will be continued as JOHN ROSELLI.

Intensive discreet investigation has been conducted’
since the first part of 1964, when information was first
received that ROSSELLI's true name was FILIPPO SACCO
endeavoring to develop other facts to prove this identity.

A report was not submitted previously because no
open investigation was conducted. Open investigation would
have in all probability compromised the original informant
and endangered his physical well veing or even his life. This
condition still exists and, therefore, the source of this
information should be carefully guarded and under no circum-
stances be disseminated outside the Bureau.

LA 4448-CTE originally furnished thé information
that ROSSELLI's true name is FILIPPO SACCO. He also furnished
information which lead to the identification of TANCREDI
TORTORA, a former associate of ROSSELLI in Boston, Massachusetts,
and Los Angeles, California.

LA HU48-CcTE also furnished considerable other infor-
mation concerning ROSSELLI's past life which furnished leads
in this investigation.

TANCREDI TORTORA was convicted in Boston, Massachusetts,
in 1934 for a murder he committed in Boston in 1922. He was ina

fugitive status from 1922 until 1934. In 1950 he was released
from prison and deported to Italy where he presently resides
in Acerra, Italy, which is located in the vicinity of Naples.

« \ TANCREDI TORTORA has been interviewed on several :
occasions and has advised that he knows JOHN ROSSELLI's true '
riame is FELIPPQ SACCO. He first met FILIPPO SACCO in Boston, .
Massachusetts, in ‘the early 1920's and stated that FILIPPO
SACCO first started using the name JOHN ROSSELLI in about
1923 when TORTORA, ROSSELLI, and one PASQUALE CAPPIELLO were
employed as track hands for the Pere Marquette Railroad in
the Detroit, Michigan - Buffalo, New York, areas. The files :
of the Pere Marquette have been checked, but no record was 4
found of the employment of any of these three men. f

TORTORA furnished considerable background information
1 concerning ROSSELLI's activities. _ Investigation conducted on
vf the basis of TORTORA's information as well as information
4 furnished by LA 4448-cTE developed no further individuals who
™ knew ROSSELLI's true name was FILIPPO SACCO.

TORTORA has declined to be a witness in this matter
and has declined to furnish a deposition setting forth his :
knowledge in this matter. He has requested that the fact that '
he has furnished information be kept confidential.

 

In the details of this report every effort has been
made to conceal the identity of LA 4448-cTE and TANCREDI
TORTORA. Some of the information furnished by them is known
only to them and to report it would disclose the source and,
therefore, it has not been reported.

 

 

 

When information was received regarding ROSSELLI's
true identity it was considered likely that if ROSSELLI was
confronted with this information he might be persuaded to
cooperate with the Bureau. }
