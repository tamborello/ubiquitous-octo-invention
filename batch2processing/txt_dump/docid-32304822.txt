Re Bureau airtel to New York 8/1/63, copy to this office.

\ * The revelations of JOSEPH VALACHI have received con-

: siderable prominence in recent editions of newspapers across Canada
and on this date the Legat was contacted by Assistant Commissioner
AL PARSONS, Director, Operations and Criminal Investigations,

RCMP Headquarters. PARSONS had just been talking with Superintenden
THIVIERGE, who is in charge of criminal investigations branch for
the RCMP in Montreal, Quebec. THIVIERGE, in turn, advised PARSONS
he had just had a discussion concerning the revelations of VALACHI
with Chief ROBERT, Montreal City Police Department. According to
ROBERT, sources of the Montreal Police Department indicate the
Montreal underworld is "extremely restless" as a result of the
publicity attendant to the VALACHI matter. .

 

Assistant Commissioner PARSONS said to date no information
has been received by the Force or by the Montreal PD which would
indicate the revelations of VALACHI included identities of the
Canadian underworld element. PARSONS requested the writer to be
certain if at all possible that the RCMP be kept advised of any and
all information of interest to Canadian authorities resulting from
information obtained from VALACHI. This request is being brought to
the attention of the Bureau and it would be greatly appreciated if
it could be borne in mind and this office advised of any such
information received which may be so disseminated. LY
