attached to for the apparent purpose of movizg into a positicn
of more preminerce in the organization, Dallas T-1 advised
that tke small group with which he bas been associated is the
lovest level in the organization and that their primary
purpose is to do the "dirty work”.

. Dallas T-1 stated that the group is also prepared,
in the event of a Fegro uprising in the Fort Worth area, to .
take action against various Negro leaders including Dr. Flint,
Dr. Fleming 2nd Dr. Ransom, and a Fort Worth hoodlum named
Madison Hogan, whos is apparently a Nation of Islam leader
in the Fort Worth area.

Dallas T-1 advised thatthe only overt action tenta-
tively planned for the winter months is that the effect of
a .30 caliber rifle on power transformers in the area may be
tested, Dallas T-1 further stated that the group apparently
has a contact with an individual in northeast Texas who goes
by the name of "South" and that this contact may be utilized
in the raiding of a northeast Texas armory during the winter
months. The primary interest is obtaining mortars and mortar
ammunition and automatic weapons; therefore, Dallas T-1
believes that the armory would probably be of a tank or
infantry group. -

ey Dallas T-1 advised that the group locally is

attempting to gain control of the Panther City Motorcycle
Club for the purpose of gaining land apparently owned by this
club, in the area of Lake Arlington, Texas, and thereafter
selling this land and using the monies therefrom for purchases _-

of the group. .

Dallas T-1 advised that it has been learned the group
has organizations in Stephenville, San Angelo, Italy and
Brownvood, Texus, Dallas T-1 further edvised that Artaur,

. Follard bas in the past made trips to Alabama, Wyoming,
Montana, Califcrnia, and that ths group kas a contact with

an individual by the name of Jim Scott in Kansas City. Dallas

21 advised that he has seen pamphlets from national Minutemen

headquarters, but that these dealt primarily with the fighting

. of any Kattonal Firearms Act which would involve licensing of

private weapons.

'T-l is always notified personally by scmeone in the group

generally within ar hour to thirty minutes ahead of a meeting

is a penter ef tke organization. . ~

Dallas T-1 advised the primary purpose of the
organization is to fight against the present Federal control
ef national and’ local Governments and to fight for "States'
rights". The group is supposedly national in origin and
believes that the Federal Government is in the process of
selling out to the communist and that the group is the last
line of defenseagaicst this sellout. he group secondarily
is racial in that it believes in white supremacy. Dallas T-1

» advised that the organization suffered a severe setback

~ because of the assassination of President Kennedy but now is.
attempting a full-scale reorganization. The group recruits
basically from these who do not have criminal records and is

: organized in such a manner that no one is supposed to know
* the names of other members in the organization. This is “to
-.. prevent effective infiltration by the Government. Ballas T-1

, advised that the group has no imzediats plane for action,

but that sever2l times locally this group has determined to

act on their own and this action; has been curtailed because

_ of orders relayed from higher authority in the organization.

. These higher authorities are unknown to Dallas T-1, except

that ea pergep by the name of Ray (last name unknoen) at the.

ranch in the vicinity of Venus, Texas, appears to be in contact

with the group's organizational leaders. Bay is described

as a personal and clave friend of retired General Edwin Waiker
