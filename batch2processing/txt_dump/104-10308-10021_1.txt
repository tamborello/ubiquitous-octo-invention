AMTURVY-~1 could furnish, SALABARRIA offered to carry out minor
sabotage actions for AMTURVY-1's American "contacts". A few
months later in October 1963, when we were satisfied with
SALABARRIA's bonafides, we managed to get a few pistols,
revolvers and some sabotage materials into SALABARRIA's hands
through AMTURVY-4. SALABARRIA responded with a plea for more,
but denied that he could retrieve an arms cache from a site on
the north coast. AMTURVY-1 became cynical about SALABARRIA's
plans and then in response to our instructions he abanconed
direct contact with SALABARRIA early in 1964. SALABARRIA,
however, continued to see AMTURVY-4 who kept in touch with both
AMTURVY-1 and QUANTUM-51.)o)

CASTRO's mother for 15 years until her death in July 1963, was

et eee He alluded to disgruntled Rebel Army officers and medica
colleagues, but he did not name SALABARRIA among those few he
identified as persons of trust. He did, however, spell out the
groups needs for weapons, money and vehicles in order to carry
out their assassination mission. And, he finally agreed to
serve as a collection agent in return for limited financial
compensation and in the apparent hope that we would in time
furnish hiw with sufficient funds for the needed vehicles.
Following his return to Havana in January 1964, MILANES proved
te be a fairly regular S/W correspondent, a source of some Order
of Battle. While he repeatedly urged us to help him obtain the
vehicles for his group, he never disclosed to us how deeply
involved he, hinself, was in the plot to kill CASTRO. We
subsequently learned that he had informed SALABARRIA of his
recruitment by CIA in Madrid and that he had tried to persuade
SALABARRIA to work directly with him rather than with AHTURVY-4.

4, MILANES was arrested in the company of his chauffeur
and nephew, both fully witting of his clandestine activities
for the Agency and presumably equally involved in the conspiracy
to kill CASTRO. From the limited evidence acquired to dste,
it appears that MILANES' arrest may have been prompted by the
blackmarketeoring of hia nephew, censorship of his mati} or
physical surveillance. In any case, it is known that he had
in his possesston compromising Agency commo equipment and S/W
natertals.
