“1@. WE ANTICIPATE THAT AT THE OUTSET OF THE COUP, UNLESS IT
“MOVES WITH LIGHTNING SWIFTNESS, THE GVN WILL REQUEST ME OR GEN
HARKINS TO USE OUR INFLUENCE TO CALL IT OFF. i BELIEVE OUR
“RESPONSIBILITIES SHOULD BE THAT OUR INVLUENCE CERTAINLY COULD NOT:

BE SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE PRESIDENT WHO Is COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND
“THAT IF HE IS UNABLE -TO CALL: IT OFF, WA WOULD CERTAINLY BE UNABLE
TO DO.SO AND WOULD MERELY BE RISKING AMERICAN LIVES ATTEMPTING TO
“INTERFERE IN THIS VIETNAMESE PROBLEM. THE GOVERNNENT MIGHT REQUEST:
“AIRCRAFT. HELIOCOPTERS, FOR THE EVACUATION OF KEY PERSONALITIES
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE STUDIED CLOSELY, BUT WE WOULD CERTAINLY
NOT COMMIT OUR. PLANES: AND PILOTS BETWEEN THE BATTLE LINES OF THE -
“OPPOSING FORCES. WE SHOULD, RATHER, STATE THAT WE WOULD BE, WILLING.
TO. ACT IN THIS FASHION DURING A TRUCE IN WHICH BOTH SIDES AGREE |
_TO THE REMOVAL OF KEY PERSONALITIES. 1 BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD

BE IMMEDIATE POLITICAL PROBLEMS IN ATTENPTING TO TAKE” THESE

PERSONALITIES TO ANOTHER NEIGHBORING COUNTRY AND PROBABLY WE WOULD
BE BEST SERVED IN DEPOSITING THEN IN SAIPAN WHERE THE ABSENCE OF

PRESS, COMMUNICATIONS, ETC, wouLD ALLOW US SOME LEEWAY TO MAKE. 4
