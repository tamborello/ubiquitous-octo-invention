. Reference is made to my memorandum to you dated

June 5, 1970, captioned as above which indteated that the

Director will meet with the heads of the Central Intelligence

Agency, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence

Agency and a representative of the White House staff in the

Director's office, at 11:00 a.m. 6-8-70, In accordance

with the Director's instructions I will be present. Unless

there is an objection I will have with me Mr. C. D. Brennan,

Chief of the Internal Security Section which will have the

responsibility of preparing our portion of the report on

the New Left and related matters. I believe Mr. Brennan

should hear and will benefit from the Director's remarks.

I have been advised that as of this date the heads

of the other agencies do not_now plan to have any of their
|assistants with them. except [Admiral Gaylor]of NSA who will bring

for him, ‘
