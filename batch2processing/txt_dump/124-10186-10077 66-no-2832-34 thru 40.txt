DIRECTOR
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
BEFORE THE

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

SEPTEMBER 22, 1976

CE- 28382 -4©

ve Of Sa

Clodisso Lt

 

  

 
Today marks my first appearance before the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence. I want to assure you that
I sincerely welcome the opportunity to work with you.

I believe that we can and must develop a clear
base of understanding between the Executive and Legislative
Branches on the proper role of the FBI in the discharge of
its complex national security responsibilities.

As the Supreme Court so aptly observed in its
Keith Decision in 1972, "Unless Government safeguards its
own capacity to function and to preserve the security of its
people, society itself could become so disordered that all
rights and liberties would be endangered,"

Yet the maintenance of national security is a
hollow victory unless it can be achieved with the least
possible intrusion into the rights and privacy of our citizens.
Balancing these imperatives will require the greatest study
and serious thought.

Together, I feel we can reach a meaningful understanding
which will best serve our country.

Since I became Director in 1973, there has been a
continuous examination of all major aspects of the FBI's
operations. One such study, initiated in 1974, established
that a quality, rather than a caseload quantity, approach in
the assignment of our manpower and other resources would

produce better results.
 

It would be in the national security.

It would be psychotogiedily satisfying |
to the great majority of taxpayers, who
already believe they are being robbed by
the government but can‘never find any
fingerprints. :

It would save billions. of work hours by
relieving taxpayers of the obligation to
master the law in order to guess -what
they oughit to hand over. :

It would free thousands and thousands
of lawyers from the-drudgery of tax
‘court. duties and: give them time.:to re-
store simple justice to the Penniless and
downtrodden.

It would eliminate the injustice of
loopholes and cheating by exposing the
secret. vaults and mattresses of the un-
scrupulous to the same peril ; as the tele-
vision sets of the working stiffs. :

Would it be criminal? Most certainly.

would-be a grave mistake to legaliz

. This would lead to a new bureauera-

, a swelling list of new amendments to

e law, specifying persons who could.

-not be burgled and privileged sanctu-

‘ aries whose boodle is forbidden to the
government’s ‘second-story men — in
short, to a new tax code.

Would Americans tolerate a- goverh- -
ment'so deep in crime? Well, they have
made the Mafia a best selling, box office
smash: They have lived happily with
bootleggers and bookmakers until gov-
ernments moved into these rackets and
ran up the costs, skimmed the take and
made it impossible to get a- drink most
places at 4 o’clock in the morning.

With a government bursting for its

venue, every American would have an}

\dded opportunity denied under the
“Present tax law. You would have the}
right; if you caught the tax collector, to
flatten him with a poker.

‘Kelley ‘Can’t. Remember’
If He Requested Break-in

—

November of 1960 while head of the Bir-
mingham FBI office. .
The former official, who was not
named by the Star, said he could not re-
call the reason given for the request.
Break-ins were among the investiga-
tive techniques used by the FBI during”
its controversial counterintelligence pro-
gram, Cointelpro — an effort to harass,
discredit and disrupt organizations that
were considered threats to the nation.
Agents wishing to break into an office or |
home had to first gain approval from —
Washington headquarters. The Cointel-
pro program began in 1956 and ended in
1971. —=
The assertion that Kelley asked for
break-in authorization is the first that al-

ime between December of 1957 atta esedly links him with such practices.

Kelley earlier this year publicly apolo-
gized for past FBI misdeeds but did not
list the past actions he considered wrong.

He also declined to say if he had ever
participated in any of the activities he
was criticizing, saying “I’m not saying
Clarence Kelley engaged in such activi-
ties or-did not engage in these activi-
ties.”

Kelley’ s spokesman said Thursday
that field agents assumed break-ins were
proper technique during the period they
were being used because the authoriza-
tion came from J. Edgar Hoover, then
head of the bureau. He said agents as-

“ sumed Hoover acted at the direction of

the attorney general or the President.
‘The Senate Intelligence Committee
concluded in its réport on the FBI that
there was no indication that any attor-

a ‘Mr. Kelley on the Spot —_

To say that FBI director Clar-
. ence M. Kelley stumbled into an
embarrassing situation this week
would be putting it mildly. Revela-
tion that his agency has been con-
ducting domestic burglaries as re-
cently as a month ago places Mr.
Kelley on the proverbial “‘spot.”
Last year the FBI chief declared
_ publicly there had been no FBI bur-
glaries since 1969. Acting quickly to
close the credibility chasm created
this week. Mr. Kelley asserted that
the erroneous statement was the re-
sult of deception by other FBI offi-
cials. .
The anger that Mr. Kelley must
surely have felt at being duped is
overshadowed by the realization
that the chain of command at the
FB" still needs overhauling.
Clearly, Mr. Kelley needs to har-
wes his underlings so that believ-

(Mount Clipping in Space Below)

ability in our law enforcement
agency can be restored. As a step in

the proper direction, Mr. Kelley is”

launching a major review of policies
involving informers — informers
who commit the crimes, including
burglaries, to gather information
and sell it to the FBI. The FBI cur-
rently spends about $3.5 million-on
informer operations.

To avoid further awkward mo-
ments in the public spotlight, Mr.
Kelley has said that from now on he
will not make “categorical, sweep-.
ing statements” about what may be
happening at the FBI or not. Appar-
ently he feels that some deceptive
practices may continue for the time,
being.

The burean director’s first order
of business should be directed at
making sure the head is aware cf,
what the tail is doing. FA

First F
guilty of cerruption |

 

  

By MARGARET GENDRY>
WASHINGTON (AP) — An
FBI section chief is awaiting
sentencing after becoming the
first bureau official in history
to plead guilty to a criminal
charge of corruption.

John P. Dunphy entered the
guilty plea Friday as part of an
agreement with Justice Depart-
ment prosecutors involved in a
broad probe of alleged financial
corruption and other abuses of
power within the FBI. Dunphy
was fired from the bureau
Thursday. :

Department spokesman Rob-
ert Havel declined to discuss
other terms of the plea bar-
gain. Normally, plea bargain-
ing involves an agreement by
the defendant to testify against
others involved in wrongdoing
in excaange for being charged
with a lesser crime.

Dunzhy, who was paid $37,800
a year by the bureau, confessed
to stealing about $100 worth of
lumber and other materials
frpm the FBI. The specific
charge was converting govern-

ment property to his own use.
He faces up to one year in pris-
on and a $1,000 fine.

Havel said Dunphy is _be-
lieved to be the first bureau c*-
ficial in FBI history to be con-
victed of a criminal charge
stemming from his job. t

A 28-year FBI veteran, Dun-
phy for the past several years
has been chief of the exhibits
section, which builds displays
for the public tour of the FBI
building. The unit also con-
structs scale models of crime
scenes and builds other dis-
plays for use in court trials.

_ An FBI spokesman said Dun-
phy’s “resignation was request-
ed Thursday and accepted as a
pesult-ef<cn internal FBI inves-

tigation." 4 :

‘Yne Dunphy case marked the
fest-erimmal charge to-emerge
from the financial corruption
probe that began last spring,
and there were signs that the
other major department inves-
tigation of FBI misconduct also
was moving toward criminal
charges.

Tt was disclosed Friday that
the department has granted im-
munity from prosecution to

ysome FBI agents who haye

agreed to testify against cul-
Jeagues involved in burglaries.
Assistant Atty. Gen. J. Sten- -

hey Pottinger, through a spokes,

+
:man, said he is “in the process
of authorizing immunity for

some agents.”
“ Department sources have
confirmed that the probe

‘directly involves at least 30
agents or officials and in-
directly involves dozens more.

FBI Director Clarence M.
Kelley has said many agents
and officials fear they may be
indicted or disciplined as a re
sult of the probe.

Department officials have
tentatively decided to seek in-
dictments against some FBI
men for violating the civil
rights of American citizens by
breaking into their homes or of-
fices, sources say.

The FBi acknowledged last
year that agents committed
hundreds of so-called “bag
jobs” against political militants
during the 1960s. Kelley said a
year ago the practice ended in
1966, but he was forced to cor-
rect the statement after dis-
covering that burglaries contin-
ued at ieast through April 1973.

Kelley has said others in the

tent of the burglaries but he

| FBI— NEW ORLEANS:

 
     
 

The .FBI_is one of the best run_ofany
federal agency and is one of the best law en-
forcement agencies in the world. It came in-
to being in the turbulent 1920s when most of
the gangsters about whom we see movies to-
day were alive and active. Crime fighting
methods developed by the FBI and the train-
ing it gave to its own agents and to state
and local lawmen did much to stem the ad-
vance of organized crime. Of course or-
ganized crime still exists. It has become
more sophisticated as technology has im-
proved in all lines. But where would we be
without the expertise of the FBI?

We believe that the current charges
against the FBI involve only a small percen-
tage of the many, many fine agents and it
may come out that the indiscretions were
merely bad judgment. At any rate, Director
Kelley appears to have the situation in hand.

The FBI is a bulwark against crime and
it] does its job well. We hope that the
C@ngress and the people will continue to
the agency the support it deserves.
