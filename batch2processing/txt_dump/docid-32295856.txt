| Attorgey CLYDE WENDELKEN advised confidentially
on 4/28/59 that Subject's father, JACK HALL, told him
that an individual he knew only as JET, who had
telephone number Hobart 4-7074, had possibly had infor-
mation concerning the Subject which. would be of —
interest. WENDELKEN stated that he felt that Mr.
HALL was undoubtedly afraid to give this number to the
FBI, however, he would give it to the Bureau on a
confidential basis and did not want his name disclosed
in the matter.

It was determined that this telephone number
is unlisted and is subscribed to by CHARLES D.
TRAVER of 1040 Lewellen. Considerable efforts to
locate TRAVER on 4/28/59 met with negative results. He
will be located as soon as possible and a supplemental
report will be forwarded to the Buréau. This lead
will be given expeditious attention. °
