took the position that he didn't care what happened and

said that he expects to go to jail. He indicated that :
his participation had been very little but that he i
would have. to pay for what he did. -He also told the
informant. that he did not know any of the persons involved i
except PAT SCHANG. He said that he had bought some stolen !
furs from SCHANG a few years ago. .

_... . MOSKOWITZ told the informant that he was going
‘to think things over and might consider cooperation with
the FBI later. It was the informant's opinion that
MOSKOWITZ appears to be afraid of the persons who he is
indicted with. ae . os

In several contacts with CG 7049=PC, .
this informant stated he had been with ROCCO MONTAGNA and
‘FRANK DE LEGGE, ‘Jr., and they had discussed how they
intended to "smear" the government witnesses in the
pending cases. This informant stated it was their
intention to accuse MICHAEL.LA JOY, JOSEPH D'ARGENTO
and PATRICK SCHANG of the murder of a Sears Roebuck
2 employee which occurred during a holdup at the Sears
Golf-Mill Store. It was this informant's interpretation
of the overheard conversation that they intended to use
PAUL PANCZKO as a witness against these three government witnesses,
PANCZKO, who was reported as being involved, would’ be
granted immunity for his testimony. .They planned to
push this case through Sears executives who have ; cos
offered a substantial reward for the solution of this
case and who are intensely interested in this matter.

.., On 2/2/68 SMERICO DE PIETTO entered a guilty
plea concerning his participation in the Hall Freight
Line theft of July 9, 1963. . This conviction was reported
in referenced report of Special Agent FRANK J. FORD, dated
2/14/68. As no previous correspondence had been r eceived
by the Bureau concerning this theft, which was basically an
intrastate loss, a summary of the background and details
of this case is being set forth in this report. .
