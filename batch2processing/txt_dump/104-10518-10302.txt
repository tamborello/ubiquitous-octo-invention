LORAN EUGENE HALL

uo HEMMING advised that HALL has not been in Miami
since approximately November, 1963, when Customs made the
seizure of equipment. He said that HALL left Miami with
LAWRENCE HOWARD, who was reportedly now in Vera Cruz,
Mexico. HEMMING did not know if HALL went to Mexico at
that time but he recently saw MANUEL AGUILAR, now a
member of the anti-CASTRO group Ejerecito Rebelde in Miami ;
and AGUILAR said he had recently heard from HALL, who is
still in Los Angeles.

HEMMING stated that HALL is about 32 years of
age and is married to 2 woman whe once was the secretary
to the President of Cessna Aircraft in Wichita, Kansas,
but as of February, 1963, when HEMMING was in Los Angeles,
HALL was residing at 285 N. Oakland, Apartment 9, Pasadena,
California. At that time he was employed by the Ernie
Porter Chevrolet Company in Pasadena.

HEMMING related that HALL and. LAWRENCE HOWARD
when en route from California to Miami in the summer of
1963 with the converted Garand rifles, were held by the
Dallas Police Department for possession of narcotic
medicines. HEMMING believed that HALL and HOWARD had
been able to obtain such medicines from doctors in Cali-
fornia on the basis of their Proposed military action
against Cuba, which would Yequire medicine for the wounded.
HEMMING did not know how HALL and HOWARD came to the atten-
tion of the Dallas police.

Interpen (Inter-Continental Penetration Forces). HALL,
who was in California at the time, was able to locate
HEMMING through the reporter. °

HEMMING related that on his return from Cali-

fornia to Miami in February, 1963, HALL accompanied

him, and after arrival in Miami, HALL attempted to asso-
ciate himself with various anti-CASTRO groups to organize
action on several revolutionary ideas of HALL, including
one to invade Haiti. None of the groups at Miami took
HALL very seriously, considering him somewhat of an un-
reliable character,

HALL eventually associated himself with a
Cuban named MANUEL '"MANOLO" AGUILAR. Together with
AGUILAR and several other Americans, including WILLIAM.
SEYMOUR from Arizona and TOM DUNKIN, a Florida newspaper-
man, HALL participated in an infiltration attempt against
Cuba but they were arrested by U.S. Customs while still
om the highway in the Florida Keys. At that time U.S.
Customs confiscated what equipment the group had, but
no prosecutions were brought against HALL or the other
individuals involved. HEMMING stated that the latter
incident occurred some time in late 1963. |

During the summer of 1963, HALL and LAWRENCE
"LARRY" HOWARD, an individual of Mexican-American descent
who was in Miami at the time, went out to California
where they were able to raise funds and obtain some guns
which they then brought back to Miami. HEMMING recalled
that they had approximately 16 Garand M-l rifles, which
they converted to automatic rifles. HEMMING said that
these weapons were confiscated by U.S. Customs on the
highway in the Florida Keys when HALL and his group were
reportedly preparing to leave for Cuba.

MM T-1, who has been involved in Cuban revolu-
tionary activities for the past ["_]years, advised on March
10, 1963, that HALL had been in Miami for about the past
three months, and associated with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING,
an American adventurer, mercenary and soldier of fortune.
MM T-l stated HALL is disagreeable, is not Liked by the
other mercenaries in Miami, is of low moral character,
and appears to have a criminal background.

On April 5, 1963, the Miami Office received a
telephone call from a LORENZO HALL, 142 S.W. 21st Avenue,
Apartment 6, Miami, Florida. HALL said he understood
that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelli-
gence Agency and Immigration and Naturalization Service
were’ trying to locate him, and he wanted to report hia
address.

On November 11, 1963, MM T-1 said that LORENZO

. MM T-l said HALL was then loosely connected with
Cuban revolutionary activities, which he uses as a gimmick
to try and obtain money donations. In Miami, he loosely
associated with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING, "MEXICAN" LARRY
HOWARD and WILLIAM HOUSTON SEYMOUR, all unemployed ad-
venturers. : “

7 MM T-1 stated HALL and HOWARD made a trip to
California several months previously in an attempt to
collect money by representing themselves as members of an
anti-CASTRO movement. It is doubtful they collected any
sizeable amount of money. Their practice is to contact
local chapters of the John Birch Society, claiming they are
anti-Communist freedom fighters, and ask for money to carry
on their work. They do obtain some money this way, and
use the money for living expenses.

In October, 1963, according to MM T-1, HALL and

LESTER R. LOGUE, 628 Meadows Building, Dallas, a geolo-
gist. It is unknown if LOGUE gave them any money.

- On December 5, 1963, MM T-1 advised that HALL
bad not been seen around Miami for about a month, and his
whereabouts was then unknown.
