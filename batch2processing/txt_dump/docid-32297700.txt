PITTMAN for some time, and he did not believe that PITTMAN _
was living at the! TAYLOR “residence at the present time, as

--4Informant knows TAYLOR-quite well-.and. believes. -he-would be—.

aware if anyone were staying regularly at the TAYLOR home.

LA 3668-8 orally advised SA THOMAS W. DENHAM
on August 5, 1959, that he had known that PITTMAN attended
a "People's World” benefit dinner, held on June 28, 1959
at .2001 South Curson Street, Los Angeles, California. :
PITTMAN's attendance at this meeting has been corroborated
through other informants. LA 366$+S stated he believed
he could determine if PITTMAN were living at the TAYLOR
residence or if he was in Los Angeles, although it might
take him a little time to do so as he did not want to arouse
suspicion by showing too much interest in PITTMAN.

On August 3, 1959, SA ROY ANDREW PETERS
contacted Mr. NORMAN SCOTT, Typographical Union, Local
174, 1426 south Broadway, Los Angeles, California, who
adviseithat they had had no information concerning
PITTMAN since he terminated his employment at Mel
Hedrick Company, 2029 Venice Boulevard, Los Angeles,
California as previously reported. SCOTT will advise if
he receives any information regarding PITTMAN.

On August 3, 1959, SA ROY A, PETERS conducted
a pretext interview at the Childrens' Music Center,
2858 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, where
WILLIAM COTTLE TAYLOR is employed as a shipping clerk, on
the possibility that PITTMAN might be working there.

The pretext was that of inquiring for a
fictitious company in that locality. ‘SA ROY ANDREW
PETERS had a chance to observe both the office and the
Shipping Department at Childrens' Music Center, and
PITTMAN was not seen there.

SA ROY ANDREW PETERS conducted a surveillance
at the TAYLOR residence, 2302 Wellington Road, Los Angeles,
California on August 3, 1959, between the hours of 4:30
p.m, and seven p.m., but PITTMAN was not observed to
return to the TAYLOR residence during those hours, although
both TAYLOR and his wife were observed at their residence.
