I have attached a copy of Mr
Crooks! speed letter, which
provides an informative and
responsive answer to Mr. D'Ung¢r.”
We should hold the line on the
proper classification of the
documents. This should then b
extended to the list of docu-
ments, since the subject
entries were deliberately made
as informative as possible.
Thus we cite exemptions (b) (1)
(properly classified) and
(b) (3) (sources and methods).
