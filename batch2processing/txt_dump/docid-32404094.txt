Dear Judge Tunheim:

Ed Cohen and I appreciated the opportunity to meet with
you and Mr. Gunn to discuss ways this Agency can facilitate
the important work of the Assassination Records Review
Board. As I hope was clear, our new Office of Information
Management is committed to ensuring that withholding
determinations or postponement requests are made
thoughtfully and only in the most compelling circumstances.

Turning to a particular matter we discussed, you will
recall that we offered to explore any avenues that might be
open to facilitate the Board’s access to relevant Russian
and Belarus records. Based on discussions with senior
officials at the Department of Defense, we suggest that you
contact Senator Robert (Bob) Smith (N.H.) who is a member of
the Joint US-Russian POW/MIA Commission, which is also known
as the Ambassador Toon Commission. He may be reached at:

Room 307
-Dirkson Senate Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20510
(202) 224-2841

In particular, we understand that the former head of the KGB
(Primakov) will be visiting Washington in the near future
and perhaps Senator Smith could intercede on your behalf
and/or arrange an audience.
