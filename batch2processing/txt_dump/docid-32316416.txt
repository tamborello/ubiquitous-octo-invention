know whether SIEGEL was staying in his apartment. Informant
pointed out that no one was answering the phone. Informant
went on to explain that TEDDY LANSKY went out to spend
Christmas with her grandchildren on Long Island as previously
planned. Informant stated that although TEDDY LANSKY's
former husband, BILL SCHWARTZ, is living tn-the same house
where she stays, this does not seem to bother MEYER LANSKY.
Informant also stated that MEYER LANSKY always refers to

The informant stated that he and BLANCHE then
drove back to Manhattan and stopped at Manny Wolf's
at 49th and Third Avenue where they met two Jewish
gamblers whom BLANCHE introduced as "HERBIE" and
"KATZ". According to the informant, BLANCHE gave each
one a white envelope. BLANCHE also gave "HERBIE" and
YKATZ" the odds on the football games to be played on
Thanksgiving Day. BLANCHE then invited him (the informant)
to come with him to the Hawaiian Room at the Hotel
Lexington. The informant protested that he was not
dressed sufficiently well to enter the Hawaiian Room,
but BLANCHE stated that he could come in overalls so long
as he was with him (BLANCHE). At the Hawaiian Room, the
informant stated that BLANCHE excused himself and went to
a table where he met two couples and had a fifteen minute
conversation.

When he returned, BLANCHE told the informant that
one of the men he had been. talking to was "HYMIE" SIEGEL,
who, according to BLANCHE, was very close to MEYER LANSKY.
BLANCHE stated that SIEGEL worked closely with MEYER LANSKY
and was a very big gambler. According to BLANCHE, SIEGEL
was a very fastidious person and lived in a hotel somewhere
off Lexington Avenue in the 30s or 40s. According to
BLANCHE, SIEGEL bathed at least three times daily, and would
not wear a suit over six or seven times, and paid the hotel
where he stayed to have the wallpaper in his room changed
at least once every year. BLANCHE went on to state that
"HYMIE" is a real gentleman and not like that"MUSTACHIO
TOMMY (THOMAS EBOLI) who is your boss!" ‘The informant
stated that he then asked BLANCHE why he, being Italian,
worked for the Jewish mob. BLANCHE stated that he had
been with the Jewish mob for many years and found them to be
more trustworthy and generous people to work with than the
Italians. The informant further asked BLANCHE why it was
that TOMMY RYAN was having meetings with the Jewish mob, and
BLANCHE replied that "TOMMY" needed their assistance in
handling labor matters, especially since he was interested
in the garment industry. The informant also stated that he
asked BLANCHE if they had come to any agreement with "NAT!'s"
union, and BLANCHE replied that everything was settled and
taken care of. BLANCHE further told the informant that he has
an office located at Seventh Avenue and 50th Street, without
giving a specific street number.

The informant advised on November 23, 1962,
that he had gone to Aqueduct Racetrack on November 23, 1962,
with BOBBY BLANCHE (BELANGI) and there they had met JACK
GRILL, PERRY FISHMAN from Philadelphia, and "LITTLE CARMINE"
BATTAGLIA from Newark, New Jersey. The informant stated
that most of the conversation was about the horses and he
had nothing to report other than "LITTLE CARMINE" BATTAGLIA
told’him he could always be contacted at Sorrento's Restaurant
in’ Newark.

Informant advised on November 25, 1962, that he
had gone to the Standard Garage on Delancey Street on
November 24, 1962, and met RED LEVINE and JACK GRILL. ‘The
informant stated that RED LEVINE is an old strong arm man
for the Jewish mob and had worked with MEYER LANSKY for
many years. He stated that LEVINE told him that MEYER
LANSKY is a very sick man. LEVINE further told the informant
that JACK GRILL was leaving on a vacation in Florida, but
would also travel to New Orleans and Phoenix. He stated that
the Jewish mob controlled certain hotels in Miami, New Orleans,
and Phoenix and all that it ‘would cost GRILL was his trans-
portation.

LEVINE further advised the informant that "they"
had a very good year so far because the football pool had not
taken any heavy "hits". He stated that they made a lot of
money on the Green Bay Packers-Detroit Lions football game
because almost everyone had bet on the Packers. LEVINE
further stated that they had a bank of almost three million
dollars and if the Packers had won, they would have broken the.
bank.

Informant stated that BOBBY BLANCHE (ROBERT
BELANGI) also stopped at the Standard Garage on the same
evening and told JACK GRILL that he would meet him later
at Manny Wolf's on Third Avenue and 49th Street.

He stated that LEVINE complained of not being
allowed to frequent Aqueduct and Belmont Racetracks since
he had been ejected from the premises by Pinkerton guards
on several occasions.

It is noted that JOSEPH VALACHI has described
RED LEVINE as an old Jewish mobster who was one of the
killers who impersonated police officers and were given
the contract to kill SALVATORE MARANZO in 1931.

MacDougal Street. After one-half hour or so at the San

Remo, they were joined by BOBBY BLANCHE (ROBERT BELANGI)

who made a telephone call shortly after his arrival. Within
ten or fifteen minutes the informant stated that PAT RYAN
(PASQUALE EBOLI) came in and held a conversation with BLANCHE.
BLANCHE then requested that the informant play Gin Rummy with
him, but stated that he had some business calls to make and
invited the informant along. The informant stated that BLANCHE
was driving a new (1962 or 1963) black Oldsmobile. They
proceeded from the San Remo, according to the informant, to

a garage located at Sheriff and Delancey Streets which the
informant thought was called the Standard Garage. Here
BLANCHE met one JACK GRILL whom the informant described as
age 60-65, 5' 10", Jewish. The informant stated that GRILL
had a metal box under his arm, and when he came into the
garage, he opened the box and took out approximately ten
white paper envelopes and then gave them to BLANCHE. From
this location, according to the informant, BLANCHE drove

to Lenox Hall, located at East 2nd Street near Avenue D

(256 East 2nd Street), New York City. BLANCHE, along

with the informant, got out of the car and met the Manager

of the premises at this location, and BLANCHE handed him

four or five of the envelopes.

After they got back into the car, the informant
asked BLANCHE as to the purpose of the envelopes, and BLANCHE
replied that he was paying off "their men". BLANCHE further
explained that JACK GRILL was in charge of the payroll for
MEYER LANSKY's men. From this loegation, BLANCHE then drove
to the Ridgewood section of Queens where they stopped at a
location on Palmetto Street near Myrtle Avenue (may be the °-
Lounge Bar which has been previously described as a gambling
and bookmakers! hangout). Here BLANCHE explained was the
headquarters for the football and baseball pools which were
within the exclusive control of the "Jewish mob". BLANCHE
stated that the baseball and football pools were operated
out of Queens because in this particular area they had the
best police protection. BLANCHE further stated,after
delivering several of his envelopes at the Palmetto Street
location, that they had paid a lot of money to some very
big men in Queens during the past. :
