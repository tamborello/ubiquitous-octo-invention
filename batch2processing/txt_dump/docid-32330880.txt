ADMINISTRATIVE:

Two symbol numbers are being used to further conceal
the identity of NO 1283-C-TE whose identity is known to the
Bureau.

As the Bureau is aware, this subject is being
contacted under the TECIP.

This individual continues to furnish excellent
quality information concerning top level officials and
associates of state and local governments and varying levels
of the hoodlum element within this Division.

Telephone toll records are not being set forth in
this report for the sake of brevity. Additionally, since
investigation to date concerning these telephone toll records
has failed to disclose any pertinent information pertaining
to out-of-state contacts with criminal types, results of
these investigations likewise are not being set forth.

LEAD:
NEW ORLEANS
AT_NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA: Will follow and report

results of Investigation.
