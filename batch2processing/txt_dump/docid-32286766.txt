GIANCANA also feels that the informant does not owe com-
plete allegiance to the GIANCANA organization, and for
those reasons is giving strong consideration toward or-
dering the informant to immediately relinquish his position
as Ward Committeeman. If GIANCANA so orders, the informant .
will then go to Mayor DALEY and turn in his resignation./ / \ i

Secretary to the Alderman of the 28th Ward. The informant

for the meets were made by JAMBRONE when the informant told
