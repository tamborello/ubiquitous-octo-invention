name NICKY MANCUSO might possibly be identical with

SAM GIANCANA, former Chicago La Cosa Nostra (LCN) leader,
who has been’ self-exiled from Chicago. ~Chicago advised
that GIANCANA in 1958 traveled to Los Angeles with
ANTHONY J, ACCARDO, ang en this occasion, information
was developed which ipdicated that GIANCANA used the
alias MIKE MANCUSO,

  
 

On 4/25/68, a letter was submitted to Commissioner
MOIR enclosing a photograph of SAM GIANCANA, and descriptive |
data on the Chicago LCN leader. A request has been made f
that Commissioner MOIR exhibit this photograph and make
inquiries to determine whether or not the NICKY MANCUSO
identified at Freeport is in fact SAM GIANCANA 4 u)
