PLERREYEROUPENSKY who CAIN indicated was now in Paris.
She did not know and had never met GIANCANA; however, she
heard of him from the time she resided in Chicago with
CAIN before their divorce. She promised to notify this
office if she heard anything further from CAIN. She was
aware that CAIN had gone to jail but that during the.time
she was married to CAIN, he was working the other side of

the fence and she met many prominent Chicago politicians
through him. (Q 4h

- Nothing further has been heard from her and it
was determined that she and hér current husband have been
transferred to San Salvador .() uh

Bax RF 17 03 76 9/22/72 that Mexico City telephone
number 5-90- x 7B is listed to AURORA M. DE QUIROZ, Coruna 54,
Colonia Alamos, Mexico City. It is noted that Mexico City
telephone numbers are frequently listed in the name of a
person other than the actualy occupant, However, ' a’ pretext
call to this number determined that -the current occifpant of
this number is Mrs, QUIROZ { ) E(u i) xu)

 

 

It is noted that both MEX ven MEX 3a have seported
rumors that GIANCANA was residing in Be 5 ex 3a On. However,
this has never been confirmed. In addition, MEX 287 reported

a rumor that subject GIANCANA supposedly was on a safari in
Africa early in 1972, This allegedly was a photographic safari
and he was accompanied by a girl friend. Mexico City has not
set a lead by LHM for the State Department Security Office to
check travel by subject GIANCANA in Kenya because Mexico City
does not have current passport data concerning the subject

GIANCANA. _ It is felt that he would travel under his true name, (AK, |

 

Pretext inquiries by MEX 34 at ‘the ‘apartment house
at Amsterdam 82, Mexico City, where subject GIANCANA had a
penthouse, indicated that subject GIANCANA as SAM DE PALM i
resided there for about two years but departed about 6/71C EX)

the information that GIANCANA was in Beirut.(K) po

GIANCANA was back in Mexico City living in a house he bought

in Pedregal de San Angel. CH Ae

MEX 287 on regular contact most recently 9/20/72
advised that he had not been in contact with subject but
knew he was in Mexico City as mutual friends have seen him,
GIANGANA was 7 oe _ playing golf at the Churubusco Golf

 

 

Club 9/17/72.
