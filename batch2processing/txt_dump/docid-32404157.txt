MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

FROM: David D. Gries
Director :
Center for the Study of Intelligence

SUBJECT: Errors in Release of 1967
Inspector General's Report

REFERENCE: Your Memorandum, Same Subject,
Dated 30 December 1993

1. This memorandum is in response to your request for
an explanation of why certain information contained in the
Kennedy Assassinations records was released.

2. The 1967 IG report is part of the "sequestered"
records that CIA provided to the House Assassinations
Committee. As far as we can determine, the facts are as
described below.

3. With one exception, it was our intention to protect
the information in question to the extent permitted by the
Kennedy Assassinations Records Act. It appears that in the
final redaction phase three items were inadvertently left in
the version that was sent to the National Archives. This
version is the same as that reviewed by the DO officers
assigned to us to conduct coordination of releases.

4. There are three specific types of information
involved: ;

a. Staff officer's name

Nestor Sanchez's name was deleted from all but
one page, where the last name only--which is a
common one in Spanish--remained. It had been
agreed with the DO several months earlier that
Sanchez's name could be released in other JFK
documents. (The officer is a well-known person,
now retired, who has been publicly identified as
formerly with CIA.)

b. Names of two covert assets

One asset was a Cuban exile living in New York.
We deleted his name on every page but one. The
second asset was a sub-source of the first, whose
name was deleted every place it appeared, with one
exception. We deeply regret these two mistakes.

c. Reference to Rome

The reference appears in connection with a
well-known former Agency officer--Bill Harvey.
Following is the precise wording. "After Harvey--
was winding up his headquarters responsibilities in
preparation for assignment to Rome, he wrote a
memorandum."

The word "station" does not appear. The JFK
Act does not permit protection of an assignment
location if it is not explicit that a station or
other permanent facility is identified. Harvey's
assignment to that city was acknowledged in the
open literature.

3. We regret release of the names of two covert
assets. It may be that the rush to review more than 250,000
pages within a mandated deadline contributed to the problem.
We are making every effort to ensure that the process of
multiple review is as effective as possible and note that
thus far, only a few mistakes have come to light.
