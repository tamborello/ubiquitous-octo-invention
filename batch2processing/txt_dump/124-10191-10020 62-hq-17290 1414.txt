Criminal Division
Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE CONTINUED:

For record purposes, the following is noted. An
analysis of actions against King recorded in the memorandum
of 12/18/75, plus those carried out against King, the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Poor People's
Campaign, and the Sanitation Workers Strike, under the
Black Extremist and White Hate and CPUSA Counterintelligence
Programs revealed the following statistics:

In 1962 one COINTELPRO-type action was carried out
against King, none in 1963. From 1964 through 1966, there
were 28 actions approved. From 1/1/67 through the assassi-
nation, 4/4/68, only eight actions were taken. Following
the assassination through 1971, there were only nine actions
taken. Seven of these actions concerned the Poor People's
Campaign.

The Committee desired the alphabetical and numeri-
cal listing of official and confidential files of former
Director Hoover to determine which, if any, of these files
would be of direct HSCA interest. This matter was coordi-
nated with Mrs. Lottie Martin, Special File Room. The
Committee was previously provided, from the official and
confidential files, a file concerning King and the personal
files of former Assistant Director Sullivan, whose personal
files were incorporated into the alphabetical and numerical
listing.
