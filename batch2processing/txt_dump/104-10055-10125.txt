objective. In addition to performing numerous photographic assignments
in support of other Station operations, LIENTRAP devoted nearly four - i
months, on a fulltime basis, to coverage of the LIERODE operation, For
several weeks the entire "take" from the LIERODE target was recorded |
from the LIENTRAP vehicle, Later, the LIENTRAP agents operated the
LIERODE technical gear from the initial LIERODE stationary base, ; \

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e.,
rent hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances,"
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other -
Station operations and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive area |
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an i
. extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities. GERENDE
oe - also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
~ Station operations requiring them,

4, The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control
and supervision is considered worthwhile, The Station concludes, therefore,
that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued.

 

C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in the previous project renewal, it can readily be noted
that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and
in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furthereance of the
Related Mission Directive. The project has not produced any positive
intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so, The project's sole
purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational
information in support of other Station operations. 4

I. CHANGES

  

“e There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the past project’ a
"year | except that SCANTLING relinquished control of the LIRICE (formerly LHERSEY) 24
surveillance team in ftily 1961 in accordance with previous plans, a oa

fii, ° EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter the
validity of the remarks made in Section II of last year's project renewal request.

Iv. PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation, which |
was described in last year's renewal request, is still present but has not caused :
any known difficulty, At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-~9736, the LICALLA
base was reactivated on 29 May 1961. The base operator has been cautioned to be

> ever alert for any unusual incidents which might indicate that the base has been
“ ‘compromised, This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY Project
during the past project year,

Vv. . PLANS

The Station considers that the project is now operating at its optimum size
and does not plan to expand it during the coming year. Rather, efforts will be
devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational
arrangements,

VIL. . COSTS

. A, Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY ~
. expended $21, 458,00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and ~
has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30. September 1961) expended about
$11,000.00. It is anticipated that about $8, 000.00 will be expended during the last ~
two months (Ocrober and November 1961) of the project year. This will make a
total expenditure during the project year of about $40, 500.00, or some #2, 500. 00
under the budget estimate of $53, 000. 00.

 
 

3. . Ensuing Period - Of the. total $49, 500, 00 budget, ‘hemized. below?” . :

a 529, 500, 00 should be. expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1962 and the ~

" balance, $20,000,00 should be expended during Fiscal Year 1963. . Normal accounting
procedures will be used for all expenditures,

Review of Project LIEMPTY

(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

a CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A.. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in 1 relation to project. i
objectives):

oe : 1. “To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK |
- personnel and physical facilities," SCANTLING has continued (See the ~

last two Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-14093,
13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18 November 1960) to provide
worthwhile information pertaining to this objective.. ; ;

a, During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be
used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY.. For example,
operational information recently indicated that the LIMERICK i.
target was using the services of a Mexico City firm to repair ;
safes, Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to '
identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner in the. H
event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to |
exploit this information in another manner, : i

 

b. SCANTLING is still the Station’s primary source for
keeping current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK
versonnel in Mexico City, This is accomplished in several ways;
the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIENVOY
leads which indicate the LIMERICK people are interested in ok
renting a given piece of property. (See previous project rehewal -. 2”
request for additional details). . a a aan

 

2, "To collect operational infor mation pertaining to other targets ;
of opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence :
interest operating In Mexico."" SCANTLING is very useful for collecting
information on other Station targets:

a. On the basis of a request to the Station from the |
ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sent to Puebla to be an
eyewitness to the 4 June 1961 Catholic inspired anti-CASTRO :
demonstrations, Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired - i
information, and samples of many of the leaflets used, but he \
prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give oo
the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs., 5 June 1961. :
SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment -
due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively.

\
;
a
b, SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that |
5 : ' Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local
. Mexico City address, This case has been of considerable
counterespionage interest to Headquarters. |
c, SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the :
Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by periodic interviews with i
the subject's neighbors and associates, i
|

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,
and surveillances, '' SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below: Lo

’ SCANTLING devoted a lot of time_to the
surveillance and attempted recruitment of a
Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy, SCANTLING an
talked wit} beveral times and undoubtedly was ee
primarily responsible for tne later success of the recruitment am
mace by another Station agent, : :

 

 

 

 

b, Some additional time was devoted t to the Cesar ;
GONZALEZ Sanchez case in february 1961 when SCANTLING
determined that GONZALEZ was still in-Mexico ity. : See.
the last renewal for additional details on this case,

 

c. In connection with the above objective SCANTLING 7
has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood investigations
for the Station. SCANTLING also does most of the local
investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE
components,

d, SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and
August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance : |
training to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey. Although ;
this is not a direct contribution to the above objective, it en
is considered sufficiently related to mention here, |

4, In addition to his contributions to the above objectives, '
SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the
Station, For example, SCANTLING is now handling LTEMBROIL-2 and i
will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962, Also, = |.
during the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance
team until July 1961 when Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico
City. SCANTLING is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments
for other Station operations,

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal, |
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and i
valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to i
other Station activities in general, SCANTLING's production, measured ,
against monetary expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors,
unquestionably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project
LIEMPTY. i

 

B, Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project i
objectives):

 

‘1. “To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK : 4
personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic base houses,’
Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute.
to this objective. To avoid repetition, ‘the Station is omitting the usual

. description of the functions of these three bases and how chev. contribute:
‘to the above objective, There has been no change in the coverage aS on
-. described in the 1960 Request for Project Renewal,

 

2, “To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP
operation, handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this
