be kept and preserved within a segregated and

l secure area within CIA for at least 30 years,
unless the DCI and the House of Representatives
fagree to a shorter period of time."

In April 1979, Robert Blakey, the chief
counsel and staff director of the Assassinations
Committee, visited CIA headquarters; and he
completed the process of designating what materials
lwere to-be sequestered. All the documents made
javailable to the Assassination Committee were
included in this sequestered collection.

The second question that often comes up
is, where did we get authority to start reviewing
these records prior to. the Assassination Act? And
lthis goes back to my point about Robert Gates
fanting to get started as quickly as possible in
the review and declassification.

So, the Agency wrote to the Speaker of the
| House, Thomas Foley, in 1992, requesting approval
Ito begin declassifying and releasing the records.
_ijand in October of that year, Speaker Foley wrote a

letter to the director, granting CIA the authority

(to do so.

The Speaker's decision was clearly made in.
anticipation of passage of the Assassination
Records Collection Act. So, we have the records,
and we started processing.

Within. the two categories that I
mentioned, the hard. copy material is one. And we .
have a page describing that for the board, which
Willi. leave with you. This includes copies of most
fof the CIA documents and the Oswald 201 file that I
referred to earlier.

“Also included in the hard copy are other
201 files, personnel files, security files on
persons who are’ mentioned in documents relevant to
the assassination or who figure in one of the
conapiracy theories.

7 This part, the hard copy, also includes
about 30,000 pages of documents, memos, and notes
-- many of these, handwritten -- that were created
poy the Assassination Committee itself. So, those
are in the hard copy.

Now, the microfilm portion of the

| conducted by the committee’s staff.
. So, these are the three categories: those
ereated for the committee at their request; others
jthat existed that we provided to them at their
| request; and others that the committee itself
created.
| Now, within the sequestered collection,
there are two major categories of records. This is
lla.simple breakdown. I hope this is helpful. One
Hcategory consists of about 129,000 pages of hard
copy. The second category consists of 72 reels of
| microfilm or the equivalent of 163,000 pages of
hard copy.

Now, the question has come up of why the
| documents were sequestered. And this is explained |
pin 2 Memotandum of Understanding, signed by the
chairman of the Assassination Committee and the
| director of Central Intelligence. And I Have a
copy here to submit to the board.

. The memorandum states that, "Upon

termination of the Committee, all materials

provided by CIA and examined by the Committee will

on Assassination and which the committee asked CIA
to hold in -safekeeping upon the completion of the.
committee‘s investigation.

And there are certain additional records,
including 400 excerpts from the minutes of the
director of Central Intelligence morning meetings
and some working files that have been added since
1992. But that’s pretty much the landscape of the
records- we have. .

By going directly to the sequestered
collection, I’d like to say that, first of all,
every document in the sequestered, collection was
available to the board for review. _ Every document
is available in full to the board without
redactions.

A portion of the documents that were >

llereated specifically in response to requests from

   

the House Assassination Committee are in the
record. Other records were already in existence
[prior to the creation of the committee. And still
other documents were created by the committee

itself. For example, there are notes of interviews

helpful. -~.-

MR. PEREIRA: In the spring of 1992, prior
to the enactment of the Assassination Records Act,
the then-Director of Central Intelligence, Robert
Gates, issued instructions to begin reviewing for
declassification all records related to the
assassination. .

. The. CIA history staff was charged with
identifying. the relevant records, which they did.
And -once that happened, our group that we
represent, the historical review group, took
custody of the records and immediately began
reviewing them for declassification for release to
the National Archives.

Fey ; Otice the Records Act was passed, our goal
became to release as many records as possible by
‘the 22 August 1993 deadline established by the Act.
And approximately 125,000 pages were transferred to
‘the National Archives by that date.

~ With subsequent releases, the Agency has

a

now declassified and transferred some 227,000 pages

yto the National archives. and based on discussions
with the Board, we're trying to release additional
information that had been redacted earlier.

The remaining records are in various
stages of review. Some require review by other
Hagencies. Some is congressional material. And
final decisions on other records are awaiting
discussion with the board, as you know.

. The Kennedy assassination records in the
CIA consist of two major groups of files.

One group consists of the documents in the

the Oswald 201 file. These consist mainly of

documents that were collected after the

jassassination and during the Warren Commission

 

vestigation. And there are about 26,000 pages of
imaterial in this file. All but a handful have been
declassified and sent to the National Archives.

The second group is one of major interest

“lite you today, I think. It‘s comprised of the

| sequestered collection. These are records that

were made, available to the House Select Committee
