J. Annex,

The equipment and Headquarters technical support furnished this
project during the past year has been commendable. A project amendment
will be submitted requesting additional equipment for the transfer of
“the intercept center as soon as modifications. and estimates are knovm.”

 

K. Emergency Conditions.

Should a crisis require the evacuation of the KUBARK staff agent
. working inside the Intercept Center, contact can be maintained with
’ LIELEGANT at his clandestine apartment, This address is retained at
the Mexico Station, If the contact is not made by Willard C, CURTIS,
the use of his name should be sufficient introduction, LIENVOY/2 coul

C. Intelligence Production,

The activities report forwarded to Headquarters each month lists
the intelligence reports received from this project. During 1962 there
were 534 intelligence reports produced by this project which were
forwarded to Headquarters through 1 December 1962. All of these
concerned RMDM-6 reporting priorities and current requirements levied
by Headquarters and the ODACID installation,

‘In addition, this project, produces a large amount of information
which is not disseminated on a current basis -but is reported to ODACID,
‘ ODENVY and other ODYOKE agencies in reply. to a steady stream of routine
file trace requests, These file trace requests run into the thousands
each month, It would be difficult to determine the exact percentage of

the information produced by LIENVOY; but in. many instances involving
prominent Mexican Government officials, large Portions of the file came

to us through LIENVOY coverage.

D. Effectiveness.

 

The LIENVOY project provides the Station with a channel to the

Which is both effective and

Papid AS Well as Covert, The Station continues to receive the daily

"resumen" highlights from the thirty (30) lines covered. A high

percentage of current intelligence is disseminated from these daily ;
reports, In addition, full transcripts are received on Soviet and so ”
Czech lines and on any of the thirty targets we may request. A good

part of this is personality data useful only to KUBARK and in some cases

to ODENVY. In addition, the project provides a support mechanism for

covering targets of interest to KUBARK or other ODYOKE agencies.

 

 

 

 

E, Problems.

 

There have been no significant security, cover, control or Liaison
problems during the past year, ,

F, Liaison.
From a liaison point of view, the Station believes that this project

contributes rreatly to the present friendly attitude of the Mexican
Government leaders toward ODYOKE policies, ‘the liaison renains

are usually made at the request of the Chief, ODACID, Mexico,

5. With recard te events which might be considered as bearing on the
sesurity of this project, the Station reported that on 15 June 1952, at
approximately 0930, the concierge noticed two men standing directly across
the street from the LP and vho seamed to have an unusual interest in the
activity of the LF. After abeut an hour both got in an automebile and con-
tinued to vatch the building from the car, and from time to time appeared

‘to be taking notes on the comings and goings of the installations, as xel].
as making notes on the cars used by the personnel of the LF. They attempted
to follow one LF employee when he left for lunch. Later that day, LIENVOY-2
and LIENVOY-L; approached one of the two surveillance men and asked for an
explanation of his action that day. They also asked him to identify himself.
He. showed them a driver's license with the name hariane VERA Gonzalez. This
information was checked at the Department of Traffic and found to be the
license of another person. The Traffic Department was staked out to deter-
mine vho, if anyone, might show an interest in the names and addresses of
the cars used by LP personnel. On the 16th of June, an agent of. the Secret
Service.of the Police Headquarters’ showed up and tried to obtain information
about the owner of the license plates on LIFNVOY-2's car. The stake-out
employee and Secret’ Service man checked the traffic files, but the information
was not there. In conversation with the Secret Service man, information vas
gained which led the Station to suspect that he was a member of an investi-
gative group headed by a Mexican whose aim is to obtain political information
for Mexican politicians. Since the 15th, no further attempts to place the
LP under observation have been noted. Any problems such as this can be
handled, if necessary, by the COS and his government contacts since this is
a joint venture. ;

 

6. During the past project year, there have been 236 disseminations
based on LIENVOY and LIENVOY-2 information: 200 from the former and 36
from the latter. LIENVOY reporting covered such topics as:

a, Activities of Mexican leftists such as

b. World’ Pea@e Council.

 

 

 

 

ec. Soviet and Czech activities in Mexico.

 

d. Activities of Soviet and Czech officials in Hexico.

e. National Liberation Movement (MIN).

eenter from its. present location. Two reasons are behind this move:
1) security, since the present base has been used for almost three years:

amendment to this project will be forwarded requesting approval for the
transfer of the intercept, center, .
