Oswald Case

The Archivist of the United States has custody of the Warren . fa, phen?
Commission documents relating to the assassination of President = "2 joe™
Kennedy. CLA, the FBI, and other governmental agencies involved fe
in the investigation are required to review their classified material | Th 1
in the above collection every ve years through 1975 and at 10-year :
intervala thereafter for the purpose of declassifying items which are : ()
no longer deemed to be sensitive from a security standpoint, Ee ee
has cooperated fully in this endeavor and has released ajaumber of

documents inte the public domain over the years,” Anything declsset~ B
fied by us has been strictly on our own volition always bearing in |
rund CLA's statucory responsibility to protect intelligence sources
and methods, oe

 

We have been pressed a number of times by “assassination
buffe" and also by CLA critica to release classified documents, :
particularly those relating to an unknowns man photog raphed | in-
front of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico Gityrwho, go far as ia known,
had absolutely nothing to do with the assassination” In order to ~~
protect a most sensitive source, we have never publicly indicated
where and how it was taken, although we made a full disclosure to.
the Warren Gommission at the time. of the investigation. The picture

 
 

 
 

   

 
 
    

ties ‘af the eurveillants. ©
‘of intelligence informiation, |’
2 Wig procavs of anewering an outside request for an “ancropped"
ee picture of this man. Invariably we are threatened with a lawsuit —

: wider the Freedom of information Act if we don't comply. >

 
 

 

Because of our need to.protect sources and methods, we have =
had to endure all kinds of phosay charges that we were involved in a~
military~industrial conspiracy to assassinate the President. Nota
single CIA exhibit has incriminating content, nor could this be since
GLA bad nothing to do with the assassination, This Agency never «~~
. contacted Oewald, interviewed hits. talked with him, or received or |

 

     

 

 

 

 
 

 

     
  
  
     

 

solicited any reports or information from him, or communicated with
him directly or in any other manner (Helms~-McCone public testimony). .
_yMost of our exhibits consist of “nut! complaints, rumors, gossip, ©
ete,; which have no security significance per se but could be embar~
rassing to an innocent person invclved; disclose a productive and hag
friendly foreign source; or acknowledge CIA "presence" abroad where wale
diplomatically this would be inadvisable. In due time, of course, all
GIA exhibita will be released into the public domain, ls
