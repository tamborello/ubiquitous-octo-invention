SUBJECT: CSI Resource Request regarding JFK

 

| passed to the EXDIR the information |provided regarding the possible resource implications
of the letter from the Assassination. Records Review Board Executive Director, T. Jeremy Gunn, and the
possibility that you will ask that some of the $5.5 million additional money Congress has added for
declassification be allocated to this task (and perhaps aiso the Korea project). | also showed him Gunn's
letter. The EXDIR asks that-you provide him the following information:

What is the size of the JFK declassification problem? How much work remains to be done?

How many people do you have working on the JFK project now?

What difference would X more make?
