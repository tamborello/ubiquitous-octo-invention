ANNEX B
THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter IL, CSHB 70-1-1, 27 October 1966

1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific ‘in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those extewories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

% THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system are: .

a. The 901 Number: a unique number, Le., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that
individual

b. The 201 Dossier: thé official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individnal, i.e., pec-
sonal history, current status, and prospects. *

e. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of
a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings.

@. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated. . .

DOHB 70-1-!
CHAPTER Ill, ANNEX Bo

15 November 1974

e. O! Code: a two letter symbal used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. Ol codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO intcrest. There are two cutegories of OF
codes for use Ly components:

(1) general O1 codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OF codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.

A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or 2 code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an Ol code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service. .

f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

a. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Croup. An opening creates
a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing
of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 201 dossiers may be
opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-
sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those
persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals
are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff
employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO |

ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categorics of persons whose 33

cet 6) Persons on whom a Main Index search reveals inforination in five |
or more documents (see DOI 70-20).

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/
ISR (opened only by IP/RMS).

b. Requesting @ 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting
a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign-
ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
. 201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 20I's. A field
rom station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-
: quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after the
eae . subject’s name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening
Te is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by
placing 201- after the terrn “File” on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN
will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-
bility of the desk to respond te cable requests. Field stations are notified of i
201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record. . '
