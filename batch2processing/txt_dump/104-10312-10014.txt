SUBJECT: International Dynamics and Gordon Novel

1. Iam unable to find any reference in our assorted files to
International Dynamics Corporation. I wonder if this could be an
outgrowth of International Security Services which made the local
papers about two years ago trying to peddle equipment and services
to various members of Congress. At that time, ISS was listed at
1026 17th Street, N.W., which should be just around the corner from
International Dynamics address. ISS was headed up by one-Albert P.
Senteio who seemed to be one of those fly-by-night operators having a
somewhat derogatory background file.

2. Iam attaching copies of two Bureau memorandums touching |
on Gordon Novel's activities in the bugging and anti-bugging field.
These were reported in substance to the Committee via Information
Notices 68-1 and 68-6.

3. Sorry I don't have anything more. I wouldn't be at.all surprised

at a connection between Novel and Senteio, since I have a feeling they
are both somewhat addicted to operating in shady areas. Senteio has
used several different company names and addresses locally in the
past several years.
