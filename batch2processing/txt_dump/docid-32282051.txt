always someone who would remark that CASTRO should be
killed. GOMEZ stated that he actually feels that the
assassination of FIDEL CASTRO would accomplish nothing
‘towards actually ridding Cuba of a Communist regime. He
denied paying any sum of money, agreeing to pay any sum

of money, or being approached for the payment of any sum
of money for the assassination of Cuban Government leaders,

GOMEZ advised that he, BABUN, and FERNANDEZ were
friends of JOSE "PEPIN" BOSCH and have talked with him on
several occasions and at such time a discussion of the
general Cuban situation was part of the conversation.
GOMEZ specifically denied being present when any sum of
money was asked of BOSCH or at any time when BOSCH agreed
to pay any money for any plan having to do with the
assassination of Cuban Government leaders,

GOMEZ stated that although he has heard of
JULIO LOBO, a wealthy former Cuban businessman with
interests in the sugar industry, he does not know LOBO
personally and has not been in contact with him.

admitted knowing BYRON CAMERON and admitted handling the
warehouse operations in Miami for CAMERON who owns and
operates the motor vessel "Cayman Hope’, He indicated the
same mute described above, on a map on his office wall

of the "Cayman Hope" and the ports at which it calls.

He likewise indicated, and voluntarily showed interviewing
Special Agents, that a good portion of his warehouse was
at that time occupied with large boxes containing Official
League baseballs, Official League softballs and empty chicken
erates made in Jamaica, He likewise indicated that the
warehousing and handling of the groceries and foodstuffs
for CAMERON are unsatisfactory inasmuch as the payment of
$1.50 per ton is not sufficient to cover the labor cost
involved in handling so many small loose packages and
boxes and the company has agreed to advise CAMERON that
further shipments will be landled at $2.50 per ton rather
than $1.50 per ton,

connections of CAMERON with any individuals not directly

in downtown New York", The only discussion concerning anti-CASTRO
Cuban plans had to do with the possibility of securing bases in the
Dominican Republic from which anti-CASTRO activities might be carried
out against the CASTRO Government. There was no mention of any plot
or plan to assassinate Cuban Government officials. . ,

He noted that over the past years since FIDEL CASTRO
has come into power that at any time Cuban refugees discuss the
possibility of overthrowing the CASTRO regime, there is someone
who will vehemently state that it would "be a great thing if someone
would kill the CASTRO brothers and other Cuban Communist leaders",
but he stated that insofar as he knew, these statements had never
been more than the venting of expressions of hatred for the CASTRO
regime and he had never met a man with any specific plan to actually
put into effect an assassination plot. Lt

the Miami area,

BABUN specifically denied any involvement in, or
knowledge of, any plan to assassinate selected Cuban Government
officials. He stated he had not paid, nor had he offered to
pay any sum of money to anyone for the purpose of effecting
the assassination of FIDEL CASTRO or of any other Cuban Government
official. He also denied that he had been a party to any

@ meetings with his associates and BYRON CAMERON, or with any .
other individuals, for the purpose of discussing ways and means
to assassinate FIDEL CASTRO.

He stated BYRON CAMERON is the owner and operator
of. the motor vessel "Cayman Hope" which plies between Miami,
Grand Cayman Island, Montego Bay, Jamaica, and British
Honduras. He stated his only connection with CAMERON is to
furnish him warehouse facilities for his cargo at Miami at
the regular price of $1.50 per ton. BABUN stated that as
a matter of fact, even this relationship might not be continued in-
asmuch as. a $1.50 per ton is for cargo which is bound together
in large boxes or bundles which can be handled quickly and
easily, whereas the cargo of CAMERON»which consists almost
entirely of greceries and foodstuffs, are in many small packages
and boxes which are very time-consuming to place in and remove
from the warehouse.

BABUN stated that insofar as he knows, CAMERON is
not interested in any anti-CASTRO plot, but he ‘has certainly

never discussed any nlot with CAMERON and certainly no plan
to assassinate any Cuban Government leaders. He stated he
never mentioned such a matter to CAMERON and CAMERON never
approached him or his associates with any plan to assassinate
Cuban leaders.

-  BABUN stated he never knew anything concerning
CAMERON's personal background and associates other than
those business associates directly concerned with the shipping
business. BABUN stated CAMERON goes from Miami to Grand

. Cayman Island off the south coast of Cuba and delivers

foodstuffs to an hotel at Grand Cayman Island as well as
hotels in Montego Bay, Jamaica. BABUN indicated at that time
that his warehouse is full of Official League baseballs

and Official League softballs as well as chicken coops

browht back by CAMERON from Jamaica. _BABUN denied knowing
anyone connected with the hoodlum element, either in the
United States or elsewhere, who is sponsoring or participating
in any plot to assassinate selected Cuban Government leaders.
He denied knowing anyone from St. Louis, Chicago, or any other
place, who has hoodlum contacts and who is in contact with
BYRON CAMERON.

‘He is acquainted with JULIO LOBO, a wealthy former
Cuban businessman who controlled better than fifty percent
of the Cuban sugar interests, and who now resides in New York.

had already called its man in Cuba and they had received :

1964. Allegedly LOBO was to fly to Miami on May 19 to arrange
for the transfer of $100.000.C0 to.a safety deposit box, keys
to which would be held jointly by CAMERON and a person in the
confidence of LOBO. ; .
