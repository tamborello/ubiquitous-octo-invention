for left democratic reform ended. Goodwin professed himself puzzled

ena en

by Johnson's’ assertion that he had discovered a "murder incorporated"
in the Caribbean. ~The only specific instance Johnson ever cited was
Trujillo, yet Johnson had known about the Trujillo assassination from

the very beginning and so could hardly have "discovered" it after hep.

became President.

5. Covert Operations and Counterinsurgency:

 

When asked about the ethos surrounding covert actions during
the Kennedy Administration, Goodwin responded that the major emphasis
was counterinsurgency, not covert action. There was certainly no
reluctance to use covert action, but no one believed that American.

& objectives could be secured through it. Counterinsurgency was some-
thing different. A good deal of money was spent training police throug
AID, much more was spent through the Pentagon equipping Latin American
militaries, and there was as well some CIA activity. At that point, |
the U.S. really believed that the communists could not get elected to
power and that the threat was subversion. Paramilitary operations
were considered by the Special Group (counterinsurgency). Latin
American matters were considered there, and in some ways Latin
America was considered a kind of training ground for Southeast Asia.
Goodwin believed that in sum U.S. counterinsurgency efforts made little
difference to the course of events in Latin America. Cuba could not
in any case provide support to guerilla movements in South America

without substantial support from the Soviet Union, and the guerilla

@ movements that began had little indigenous support.

During the 1960 Presidential campaign, Goodwin did foreign —~<S_D?’
policy work for John Kennedy, specializing in Latin America. After the
election he moved into the White House to handle Latin America. During
that period he spoke with the President about a Latin American matter
on the average once a day. Goodwin left the White House in the fall of
1962, becoming Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American

Affairs under, first, Robert Woodward and then Edwin Martin. After

   

working for the Peace Corps, Goodwin was brought back to the White
House by President Johnson, in the spring of 1964, after the Panama
crisis. At that time, however, he did not specialize on Latin America,
instead writing speeches for Johnson. He left the Administration late

in 1965.

1. Assassinations:

In general, Goodwin had not heard much specific talk of as-
sassination, although it would not have surprised him if it had gone
on. He mentioned one specific instance in which he had heard talk of
assassinating Castro. After the Bay of Pigs, a Cuba Task Force was
established, first chaired by Paul Nitze and then by Goodwin in his
capacity as White House Staff Officer. At a meeting of the Task Force,

@ held at the State Department, McNamara suggested "getting rid of Castro,

someone from the CIA, perhaps Bissell, then asked if McNamara meant

the President probably. did not know of the gun transfer, but he said
that the assassination and the U.S. role with respect to it would have
come as no surprise to the President. He doubted that the CIA even
would have had to clear the transfer, although a general policy of that
sort might have been passed by the Special Group. :
Goodwin reported no other mention of assassinations. In fact,
he said he once heard a CIA man say that assassination was a bad idea
because once started, it never ended. However, an agent in the field
might regard killings of one edt ée" another as within his mission in
supporting one political faction over another. And of course someone
might have gotten carried away. It was clear from the Bay of Pigs that
the CIA sometimes acted without, or even against, instructions (e.g.
by bringing Batista followers into the Bay of Pigs invasion team). In
general, Latin American work seemed to attract the worst personnel in

all Washington agencies including the CIA.

CIA Activities in Brazil:

"> The Kennedy Administration decided that left wing democratic
forces in Latin America were the only means of combatting communist
influence and promoting development in the region. That decision was
applied to Chile, and the U.S. switched its support from the conserva-
tive Alessandri. Goodwin sat in on meetings of the Special Group only
rarely, only if Latin America were the subject of the meeting. As he
remembered it, the proposals that came to the Special Group were genera
statements, policy papers, not descriptions of recipients of support or

conduits. In line with the policy, support was given to left democrati

political elements. The U.S. certainly provided assistance to the

4, Changes during the Johnson Administration:

Johnson cared less about Latin America than had Kennedy--
Johnson was interested only in Mexico--and so knew less.about covert’

actions in the region. Thomas Mann was left to run Latin ‘American

policy, although the President did become active in the two crises-- :

 

Panama and then the Dominican Republic. Goodwin saw a sharp change

in United States’ policy under Mann. Mann supported the military and
