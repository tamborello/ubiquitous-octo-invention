Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

Iam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board's requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised. dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April-1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CLA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CLA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

Barry,

Per our meeting earlier this week, | called Lockheed security today and discussed the Board's interest in learning what U-2
records Lockheed might have and how they might be searched if Lockheed were to look for records on “the” manual. The security
officer | talked to, Roy Kidd, said he suspected it would be looking for a needle in the haystack, but he wouldn't know without doing some
checking around. He will get back to me. In the meantime, you may pass on the names of the two points of cantact, Roy Kidd or Jim
Ghezzi, both at 805-572-4379 (commercial line).

If the Board wants to deal with Lockheed through me, !'ll help them do this. If they want te deal directly with Lockheed, that's
fine, too... | would just ask that you and be kept informed. { told Lockheed the same thing.

Would you mind faxing to me the page from the Ben Rich book? | seem to have temporarily misplaced my copy. My open fax is

OVERFLYING RUSSIA 153

The next thing we tried was something called a Salisbury
screen, a metallic grid applied to the airplane's undercarriage
in the hope of deflecting incoming radar beams, but it worked
only at some frequencies and altitudes and not at others.

Kelly thought it was more practical to try special iron fer-

‘rite paints that would absorb a radar ping rather than

bounce it back to the sender. The paints were moderately ef-
fective but inhibited heat dissipation through the airframe's
outer skin and we experienced overheating engine problems.
But the paint lowered the radar cross section by one order of
magnitude, so we decided to give it a try. We called these
specially painted airplanes “dirty birds” and shipped the first
one out for flight testing in April 1957. Our test pilot, Bob
Sieker, took the U-2 up to over seventy thousand feet and
suddenly radioed that he was experiencing rapid airframe
heat buildup. Moments later his engine blew out and the face-
plate blew off Bob’s oxygen mask as his pressure suit in-
stantly inflated. The U-2 dove straight down and crashed. It
took us three days to locate the wreckage and Bob's body. An

_ autopsy revealed that above seventy thousand feet he had

suffered acute hypoxia and lost consciousness in only ten
seconds. The culprit that killed him was a defective faceplate
clasp that cost fifty cents.

The CIA was so desperate to buy time for these Soviet over-
flights that Bissell got Kelly to sequester four of our test flight
engineers and have them write a bogus flight manual for a U-2
twice as heavy as ours and with a maximum altitude of only
fifty thousand feet that carried only scientific weather gear in
its bay. The manual.included phony instrument panel photos
with altered markings for speed, altitude, and load factor
limits. Four copies were produced and then artificially aged
with grease, coffee stains, and cigarette burns. How or if the
agency got them into Soviet hands only Mr. B knew, and he
never told.

IN THIS DOCUMENT

Mr. Donald E. Welzenbach

830 Mississippi Avenue

Davenport, lowa 52803

Dear Mr. Welzenbach:

Iam writing you on behalf of the Assassination Records Review Board, an independent

' Federal Agency established pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994). The Review Board, whose
members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, is charged with
the responsibility of collecting records and information related to the assassination of
President Kennedy. Review Board members and staff are required by law to possess
Top Secret, SCI clearances. The Review Board is not seeking to reach any conclusions
regarding the assassination, but is primarily concerned with identifying, clarifying,
locating, and making available assassination records. I am enclosing some explanatory
material about the Review Board and its mandate.

Also enclosed is an excerpt from the book Skunk Works, by Ben Rich and Leo Janos,
which refers to Lockheed’s preparation of four sets of falsified U-2 technical manuals at
the request of Richard Bissell of the CIA. It.is our understanding that while working as
a CIA historian, you wrote the first history of the U-2 for that agency. We would like
very much to discuss this subject with you, and believe that your past in-depth
knowledge of the U-2 may assist the ARRB in our attempts to clarify the historical
record in this area. I am taking the liberty of forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr. John
Pereira, of the Historical Review Group, Center for the Study-uf Intelligence, Central
Intelligence Agency, Washington, D.C., 20505. To the extent that you feel discussing
this subject with the Review Board would constitute disclosure of any information that
is still classified, we would be happy to initiate a discussion between you and the
appropriate officials at the CIA to address any concerns you may have.

Sometime in the near future a member of the Review Board staff will be calling you to
establish a mutually agreeable time for a telephonic interview to discuss certain aspects
of the U-2 program. Should you wish to call us first in response to this letter, please ask
