still had the, three small craft tied on. behind. He stated

. observation and the photographs were made at approximately
fioon._ on March 24, 1963.

Lieutenant ROGERS’ displayed the four photographs

- and it was noted that in the photographs there could be
observed approximately eight individuals aboard the boats,

two of whom were taking pictures of the Coast Guard plane
at the time the photographs were being taken from the Coast

_ Guard plane.

Lieutenant ROGERS stated that again on March: 25,
1963, the "Alisan'' and the small boats tied to it were re-
ported by the Coast Guard plane flying out of St. Peters-
burg, Florida, to be observed in the same location where ©
they had been observed on the two previous days. He stated.
no photographs were taken on March 25, 1963, however, and the
report of the "Alisan's" position was made by radio message.

Lieutenant ROGERS stated that all the islands of
the Cay Sal Bank, with the exception of Cayo Sal, itself,
are not ‘permanently inhabited and none has any water’ supply,

other than Cayo Sal, itself, so that the Coast Guard, in

making its flights, considers anyone found in these islands .
to be marooned, unless it is obvious they are not experiencing |

any diff iculty. He said there had been no signal of distress

from thé individuals aboard the "Alisan" at the times the

Coast. Guard plane flew over the yacht.

He stated there was no evidence of any weapons

‘aboard the "Alisan" at the time he, himself, observed the

eraft on March 24, 1963.

Lieutenant ROGERS advised that the Coast Guard
did not make a flight on March 26, 1963, to the location
‘where the "Alisan" had been observed on the previous
days, due to the fact that the plane was deferred to ©
another area on a search and rescue mission.

Lieutenant ROGERS.pointed out that with respect
to.the message received by his office relative to the ©
sighting of the "Alisan" by the Coast Guard plane on March
25, 1963, in the area between Damas Cay and Anguila Cay,
it was not specificalls stated that the vessel sighted
was the "Alisan," but from the description of the craft
there appeared little doubt but that the vessel described
was, in fact, the "Alisan."

Lieutenant ROGERS located a copy of the message
pertaining to the March 25, 1963, observation which was
received from the St. Petersburg, Florida, station of, the
Coast Guard on March 26, 1963. “The , message stated:

“"gighted 50 foot cabin cruiser, white hull, ;
tan.cabin, blue foredeck, at 23-42 N, : :
79-44 W, anchored at 1:10 P.M., name not :

speedboat then left the scene and rendezvoused with
the 'Alisan" at Dog Rock in the Bahamas at about 6;00
A.M. the same day and then separately returned to Miami.
The raiders claimed they had no guns or explosives on
board either boat upon their departure from or return to
the U. S. and that these materials had been obtained from |
islands in the Bahamas where they had been previously
stored for this operation. The two newspapermen were
JOHN THOMAS DUNKIN of Moore Haven, Fla., and ANDREW ST.
GEORGE, who allegedly took photographs for "Life" magazine
during this operation. DUNKIN admitted his participation.
CUESTA stated that the entire operation cost about $7,000,
which was raised over a 5 months period, during which time
the 11 participating Cubans individually donated their
labor and money’and solicited funds. from sympathetic
Cuban exiles. CUESTA stated that the raiding party did
‘not notify U. S. Customs or INS of their departure or.
“return to U. S. as they were following the same pattern
previously set when such operations were carried out with
the assistance and cooperation of the U. S. Government.
He claimed that if a responsible U. S. official had so
requested, he would have refrained from making this raid.
He stated that the action of the U. S. Government in
opposing this raid came as a complete surprise to him
and his companions in view of official statements and ‘
previous actions of the U. S. Government with regard to
the Cuban situation. U. S. Coast Guard took aerial photo-
. graphs of the "Alisan" in the Cay Sal area several days ;
prior to the attack. U. S. Customs, Miami, searched and .
seized the "Alisan'' at Rama Marine Docks, North Miami . :
Beach, Fla., on 3/31/63. U.S. Customs found on board
a ship's log reflecting various movements of this boat
during the pertinent period, a 20 mm. cannon, a quantity
of ammunition, explosives, sea charts and a code. On ;
