; The WASHINGTON DAILY NEWS for 6 July 1961 contained an
article concerning a Joseph Patrick HEMMING, leader of an anti-
CASTRO group called Intercontinental Penetration Force (INTERPEN )
who was identified as Subje OS file on INTERPEN shows no Agency
connection. Rather, it was investigated by the FBI in July 1961
for possible violation of U.-S. neutrality laws.

 

  

: . In February: 1962. HEMMING was.the subject. of a Los Angeles
Field Office investigation. The Los Angeles Sheriff's office had
recovered a U. S. pistol from a car in the area on 30 January 1962.
EMMING appeared at the Sheriff's office to claim the pistol stating
that he was a CIA agent on a training mission in connection with a
Cuban assignment. HEMMING was interviewed by the Los Angeles Contact
Office concerning the incident, and according to the interviewer,
Subject never.claimed to have worked for the CIA. He had furnished
certain information concerning activities in Cuba in the form of
reports to the Los Angeles Contact Office since approximately
October 1960.

 

 

 

 

Of particular note in Subject's file is a copy of an article
by one Bill STUCKEY entitled “Anti-Castro Base Near Covington" which
appeared in the New Orleans STATES+ITEM for 21 July 1962 (copy attached).
It concerned Subject described as an American soldier-of-fortune,
Gerald Patrick HEMMING.. aka Jerry PATRICK, who showed up in New Orleans
in February 1962 "apparently at the invitation of local Cuban Revolu-
tionary Council leaders and other Cubans who wanted to take direct
action against CASTRO. With the help of anonymous U. S. patrons, the
Cubans began supplying PATRICK with machine guns, exlposives and
other military supplies.

 

"PATRICK made regular trips here (New Orleans), slipping in
and out of the port secretly in a modern, well-equipped PT boat.

"Last spring (1962) another anonymous U. S. patron offered
the Cubans and PATRICK a large tract of land - complete with air strip
on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. PATRICK agreed to set up a
training base, handling classes of 50 or so Cuban recruits at a time.
After completion of the training, the guerrillas would be like their
Everglades counterparts, transported to Cuba secretly to work with
the anti-CASTRO underground . "

The article then states that the Miami Cuban Revolutionary
Council "nixed" the Covington base for undescribed reasons.

The article further states that although the "PATRICK"
guerrilla base plan fell through, the New Orleans STATES-ITEM con-
firmed in April 1962 that "Cubans were trained here (New Orleans)
at the old Algiers ammnition dump, for the Bay'of Pigs invasion."
(This was the Agency training locale - not Lake Pontchartrain as
alleged by GARRISON).. -
