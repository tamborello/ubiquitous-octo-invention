the document only as a manuscript. Inasmuch as the document had
been inadequately identified in the computer system, it did not
turn up in response to a querry to the computer for any previous
releases of the ZRRIFLE document. (U)

4. The undersigned compared the ''Borosage release" with the
document sanitized for the HSCA. There is a great deal of dif-
ference, not all of it to the Agency's advantage. The sanitization
of the "'Borosage release" was done in a slipshod manner, e.g., on
page 6 of the document as released to Borosage the cryptonyms
KUBARK and KUBARKER appear in paragraph 3); on page 7 the cryptonym
KUTUBE appears, also the true name or pseudonym SILVERTHORNE ap-
pears; on page 8 the cryptonyms KUBARK and LAURICLE appear; on

page 9 see KUBARK and SILVERTHORNE, and on page 10 see true names:
Sid [Gottlieb] and [Horton] Telford. To be fair, it should be .
noted that Jim A's name on page 10 and COS, Luxembourg on page 4
were left in the release to the HSCA. COS, Luxembourg appears on

- page 198 of volume IV of the HSCA Final Report. Jim A's name

appears on page 202 of the same volume. (0UQ)

5. The undersigned has. sanitized a copy of the ZRRIFLE document
as it was released to Robert L. Borosage and has included any
information released to the HSCA that was deleted in the Borosage
release. The attached ZRRIFLE document may be passed to Lesar.

FROM : Russell B. Holmes

Consultant, IMS/FPLG | (OUO)
SUBJECT : Document relating to ZRRIFLE (U)
REFERENCES : A. Memorandum to James H. Lesar,

dated 1S March 1985. Enclosure:
First CIA Release to Lesar,
F81-0351 (I) (U)

B . Memorandum, dated 22 July 1985,
from E. Page Moffett.

{ 1. The writer of the memorandum (see reference B) states in
paragraph 2 that Lesar called the former's attention to a
document listed in three places in the enclosure to reference
A as nos. 38, 39, and SS. Lesar claimed that much more of
this document had been released previously to [Robert L.]
Borosage. (U)

2. The document in question, handwritten, undated, and with

the title "Project ZRRIFLE" had been released previously in

sanitized form as, JFK Exhibit F-522 in Volume IV (pages 197-

203) of the HSCA Final Report (1979). The sanitization of the

copies of documents nos. 00038-02592, 00039-02638, and 00055-

03471, conformed to the previous sanitization. At the time

when this sanitization was made (in late 1978 or early 1979)

it was not known that the ZRRIFLE document was one of several

documents (81 to be exact) that were the subject of a litiga-

tion involving Robert L. Borosage and the Agency. (U)

3. To confirm the validity of Lesar's claim, the undersigned
reviewed the Robert L. Borosage Case No. F75-0676. The Agency's
file did indeed contain a copy of the 9-page ZRRIFLE document
(number 42). .The undersigned then reviewed the computer run
describing the contents of the Borosage case file. The entry
for document no. 42 gives no date and no subject. It describes
