One copy of letterhead memorandum characterizing
informants. .

ADMINISTRATIVE:

On 2/27/63, the San Francisco division reported
that on that date SF-2550-C-TE informed SA ROY L. ERICKSON
that he was visiting with ALEX CAMARATA, a neighbor of his,
on the night of 2/26/63 and that during the discussion at
CAMARATA's residence, the informant mentioned that he
recalled that PETE MISURACA once stated that he had been
to Jackson Hole, Wyoming with HAROLD SMITH. CAMARATA became
very upset over this and stated that MISURACA should not
have mentioned this; that the "organization" had checked
up on PETE MISURACA and his activities at Jackson Hole,
Wyoming through a person he identified as LOUIE BOSCHETTO
(phonetic). He identified BOSCHETTO as a "friend of ours" °
which indicates that BOSCHETTO is a member of the
"organization." According to the informant, CAMARATA
stated that BOSCHETTO was a senator of some kind and
owned the El Rancho in Rock Springs, Wyoming.

San Francisco further reported that the :
informant and CAMARATA are both members of La Causa i
Nostra and were involved with PETE MISURACA in an
attempted extortion of HAROLD SMITH, ‘part owner of
Harold's Club, Reno, Nevada, based on an alleged debt
owed to MISURACA by SMITH. Several trips to Reno were
taken by CAMARATA and MISURACA and the informant in
this connection. Subsequently, there was a dispute
between CAMARATA, MISURACA and the informant since
MISURACA was desirous of pressing the matter, even
though "the organization" had ordered it to be dropped.

On 3/8/63, Denvércrequested'SanwF¥ancisco and
New York by airtel to furnish Denver with additional
details to establish approximate dates pertinent to the
incident allegedly involving BOSCHETTO in order that

additional inquiries might be made and ebnsideration be
given to the advisability of interviewing BOSCHETTO.

On 3/25/63, San Francisco reported that
SF-2550-C-TE had been recontacted for further details OTHER 4
but had stated that when the above information was given
him concerning this matter by ALEX CAMARATA he was not
in a position: to question CAMARATA further, and he could
not again bring up the matter without bringing suspicion
upon himself. Informant stated that he would be alert
for any possibilities in the future by which he may
bring up this subject with CAMARATA and endeavor to
develop additional details.
