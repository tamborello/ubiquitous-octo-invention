MEMORANDUM

TO: Bill Bader

 

FROM: Frederick paron€¥>
DATE: August 5, 1975
SUBJECT: REVIEW OF CIA FILES: AMLASH, ZRRIFLE, and QJWIN

 

I spoke with Seymour Bolten at noon. We confirmed the
following arrangement for review of the AMLASH file:

 

1. This is to be treated as a non-precedential case.

2. Only Gordon Rhea and myself are to review the file.
(Seymour readily agreed to include Gordon.)

3. The review will take place in 2-E-45, with an Agency
representative present.

 

4.. We will see all of the AMLASH files (approximately
fourteen folders). ; ;

5. The files will be available in unsanitized form.

6. We will take no notes that involve any names which
they might want to sanitize. We will be permitted to
make a checklist of the documents we wish copied.
(Seymour said he did not mean to exclude all notes,
but simply sensitive names. We will limit ourselves
to making a checklist, however, to avoid any possible
misinterpretation of our [Tofty7 motives.)

 

7.. After reviewing the unsanitized files, we will indicate , ee
the documents that we wish copied. The Agency will more
sanitize those documents and will provide us with
copies of the sanitized version.

Note: No mention was made of the procedures we will follow
in checking sanitized copies against the original.

 

Bolten was aware that Elder had no objection to my review of : Laue
the ZRRIFLE and QJWIN files. in unsanitized form. :

MEMORANDUM

TO: Bill Bader
FROM: Frederick Baron
DATE: . August 4, 1975

SUBJECT: Contact with CIA

EXECUTIVE ACTION

This morning I made a request to Walt Elder over the
phone to have the opportunity to review two files tomorrow
morning -- Project ZRRIFLE and Agent QJWIN. Elder indicated
that this would be no problem.

CUBA ASSASSINATION STUDY

I also made an arrangement with Seymour Bolten last week
to review the AMLASH file tomorrow morning along with Gordon
Rhea. Bolten made arrangements for this. He said there would
be a need to wait several days to. ready the file for review --

I presume he intended to sanitize it in some fashion. He agreed
to allow us to select documents for xeroxing and delivery to
the Committee offices.

ALIAS TESTIMONY

Several past and present CIA personnel have testified
before the Committee in the past two weeks under alias. I made
an arrangement with George Clark, of the CIA General Counsel's
office, to have each such:person sign a statement indicating
his true identity. The statement is to be on file at the CIA,
available for Committee verification. The Committee will receive
a sanitized copy of each statement for attachment to the pertinent
transcript. Seymour Bolten approved this arrangement and promised
to supply sanitized copies of the handwritten statements that
were signed and filed at CIA before the arrangement was made. I
am.to supply him with a list of names tomorrow of all witnesses
who testified under alias.

Robert Q. Marston, President : oe
University of Florida: ;
226 Tigert Hall ;

Gainesville, Florida

Dear President Marston:

In the course of the inquiry of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence Activities, a question has arisen
‘concerning the date of a conversation between former Senator
George Smathers and President Kennedy. Senator Smathers
cannot recall the date, but he does remember preparing a

memorandum for the President at that time.

Senator Smathers has authorized the Committee to re-
ceive from the University of Florida a copy of this memoran-
’.dum. Please phone Senator Smathers at his Washington office
. (202/785-5300) if you wish to verify this.

Senator Smathers said that the memorandum was among
his official papers which he donated to the University of
Florida upon his retirement from the U. S. Senate. The
memorandum should be dated sometime in 1961. It deals with
a proposal for precipitating an attack on Guantanamo Bay in
order to lead to a United States invasion of Cuba. ..

; We would greatly appreciate it if you could arrange
for the retrieval of this memorandum from your collection as
soon as Possible in a confidential manner. .

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

_ Sincerely,

Frederick D, Baron

Special Assistant to the
Chief Counsel

Dear Mr. Fenn:

This letter will confirm a telephone conversation between
Peter Fenn of our staff and Bill Moss. Gregory Treverton, who
will carry this letter with him, is coming to the Library to
review Kennedy tape recordings. This is a continuation of the
review other members of our staff conducted several weeks ago.
It pertains to our inquiry into the assassination issue. The
primary purpose of this visit is to verify the authenticity of
a particular quotation.

_ Thank you for your consideration and your continuing as-
sistance to the Committee,

Sincerely,

William G. Miller
