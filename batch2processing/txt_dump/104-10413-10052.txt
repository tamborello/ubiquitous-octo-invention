has already been proven, in a_recent operation with the/L.IERODE) installation
as a target. Seven reels of "hot mike]' take were obtained in ‘test runs on
checking both the operation (including installation of the ‘fmiked' instrument
in the office of the\head_ of thé\LIERODE) official installation) and the equipme:
which was of radical design and conceived and built by the KURIOT technician
assigned to Mexico City Station under deep cover, Unfortunately, before con

‘complete renovation of its telephone system, including the installation ofa —
switchboard. This, at least temporarily, precludes further operation agains’
_ this particular target, unless a direct line is installed there. However, it is
_-,-the intention of the Station to attempt coverage.of other targets of interest. In

Performance of Agents

The overall performance of all agents employed in the LIFEAT complex con-
-tinued to be good during the period of the project review, with security being ,,
stressed in all phases of the operation. No security problems were encountc ~
which were not solved by the personnel involved. Since the success of the
LIFEAT operation depends largely upon the security of its personnel, Head-
‘quarters clearances and evaluation of new personnel will continue to be sougi:
on those new additions who pass a strict field assessment,

 

Ve Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 September 1961 for FE
. 1962 in the amount of $98,973.00. The proposed budget for FY 1963 is brok

to the (Lia isoij forces, well justify the expenditure of funds, time, personnel,
and security risk, As it has been noted in the past, that even with the Station's
_envolvement in the parallel, but[liaison), LIENVOY operation, a change in
attitude by the present(local governmént,administratiof@or a change in(govern-
. ment administrations] could end KUBARK participation in that{liaisor/project,
*. For that reason, LIFEAT, in addition to maintaining its present heavy coverage,
: must:be available -to. once again undertake coverage of the official Soviet and
Czech official targets in Mexico City, Therefore, LIFEAT's. present orientation,
« though toward supporting Station operations and CI/CE mission rather than towar
‘ targets which would provide positive intelligence, leaves it readily available for,
_ = recall into the Soviet-Czech coverage. It is the Station's firm opinion that the
i LIFEAT project provides a substantial and vital contribution in fulfilling the
- + geveral priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive

“1,” There is attached a list of the HMMs produced from LIFEAT provided material
during the period July 1961 through May 1962 as a by-product of the project's

 

- s prime responsibility of providing support to Station operations,
IL..° Progress of the Operation

-. The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and are there- ~
., fore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of time,. For this ~

|; reason percentage figures as to completion of project.objectives cannot.be drawn.
* However, an indication of the coverage provided in working toward fulfillment

' of the objectives can be noted in that ages of ra

' in the period July 1961 through May 1962, LIFEAT has been in daily operation

- during the review period with the average number of lines covered per month
‘being 20, with a high in March 1962 of 28 lines covered, :

Ill, Planning for the Future

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes to re-
main uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditure of a great portion

of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one target.,.such as Soviet
Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically, however, that should the need aris
for LIFEAT to again assume such responsibilities, it is fully able to do so,

Until such time LIFEAT will continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employ- .
ment of its assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish to
‘reveal its interest or operations to the[liaison]forces involved in the LIENVOY
operation, . ,

As to particular areas of operations, the Station has hopes of employing
LIFEAT assets in “hot miké operations which require access to telephone

 
13-00000

 

continue to provide in this-area is vital and basic to the mounting of any
operations against the Yugoslav target.

7 ‘LIFEAT/ Soviet/ Double Agent: LIFEAT support has provided needed sup-

‘porting information in backing Station double agent operations, In this area

the success of the operation is obviously dependent upon the veracity of the
agent, LIFEAT provides information which enables the interested case

. officer. to determine the veracity of the agent involved. LIFEAT also provides
_-a-needed check upon the activities of the double agent.

* LIFEAT/Spanish Republican: LIFEAT coverage of Spanish Republican exiles
in Mexico City have enabled the Station to monitor the activities of the various
_ . groupings of the exiles, including the projected attempt on the life of the

_ senior ODACID official in Mexico, LIFEAT has covered personalities of exile ®
factions both involved in planning this attempt and those opposed to it, Covera
of targets in this area also enables the Station to keep abreast of the plans and -
activities ofthe various groups which make up the Spanish Republican exile
community in Mexico City.

 

- yerage: LIFEAT leads in this area are exploited in the re~

. porting of travel of important Communists, particularly to Cuba and Iron

. Curtain countries, e travel of U citizens, especial] j nel
Leftists, to Cuba, Through coverage of the American Communist Group in
Mexico (ACGM) LIFEAT has provided ODENVY with an increasing amountof
information on the leftist activities of relatives and friends of the ACGM who
reside in the U.S. One of the noteable items in this regard is providing data
on the overt and covert efforts of the blacklisted "Hollywood Ten" to regain the...
former status in the U.S. film industry. , aan

 

 

 

Finally, and certainly not of least importance, Station security has beenenhan.
through LIFEAT periodic coverage of former Station assets, like LIVESTOCK:
and LIVESTOCK-2, who could be a danger to particular Station operations or
personnel, Monitoring of certain terminated agents is considered especially
valuable where these agents were involved in the more sensitive operations,

H, Conclusion

 

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided other Stati
_ Operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the ability of the{unilateraQ
LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets without revealing Station interest

G. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting Mexico City
Station through production of leads unobtainable th bh other and gen-
erally providing other Station operations the secure support only available
through a(unilateraDrelephone tap operation, The following is a selected list,
together with a brief description, of major contributions of operational support
and leads provided through LIFEAT:

‘LIFEAT/Cuban: The most noteworthy LIFEAT contribution to Station efforts
iin the Cuban operations field was that of providing leads pinpointing the acti-
‘vities of Transcontinental, S.A, in the illegal transshipment of U.S. materials
‘to Cuba via Mexico, LIFEAT was able to continue coverage of the activities
lof this company despite the efforts of the company to lose itself in the Mexican

‘business community by changing the name it operated under to Inversiones
«Mexicanas, S.A, and changing its location and telephone number. Valuable

i informati ion on the commercial commodities needed by the Castro regime,

| methods and contacts used in their procurement, and information on the con-
‘tacts of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico were obtained,

 

» LIFEAT/Czechoslovakian: LIFEAT coverage of the home phones of two Czech
+ intelligence officers provided some leads to their contacts, but more impor-
“tantly, provided greater security to KUBAR K when one of their CIS officers, SSUES
| Miloslav CECH, was singled out for a defection attempt, Through LIFEAT
. "livemonitoring” of both the original and followup defection attempts, the
# KUBARK assets were provided maximum protection from possible attempts
il by CECH to alert his coworkers or arrange entrapment of the KUBARK per-
, sonnel involved,

1 | LIFEAT,/Polish: Probably the most "classic'' example of the use of a telephone

: tap in providing a lead which could gevelop into a_vital penetration of the Polish |

* intelligence occurred recently in the(BEKNA VE/BHCHICK operation, LIFEAT

' provided the initial leads which made the Station aware of the possibilities of an
operation and has continued to provide vital information for Station's develop-
ment of the operation, It is the Station's opinion that this. one instance of service |
by LIFEAT was well worth the cost of the entire project for the year. (Full
information forwarded in MEXI 0462 and MEX1 0463). Also of great interest

_ to the Station were the LIFEAT provided leads which revealed Jan SLUSARZ,
Attache of the Polish Embassy in Mexico, had purchased an automobile which
had been stolen in the U.S, and driven to Mexico, In this operation, in which
a defection attempt was considered, LIFEAT provided not only the initial leads,
but also daily operational information vital to the Station's efforts in this case,

 

LIFEAT/ Yugoslavian: In this coverage of the Yugoslavian Embassy LIFEAT is.
providing the basic data necessary in establishing operations against this target. |
‘Since the Station is expanding its coverage of Yugoslavian activities, much vital |
-data on personalities, contacts, and services obtained by the target establish-
ment must be provided, It is this exact type of coverage that LIFEAT is geared
; to provide in addition to the operational leads which will be forthcoming as this |
, coverage progresses, The interested case officer, noting LIFEAT is his only

PROJECT REVIEW

 
   

Product of the Project
AJ Soviet Coverage

’ } As noted in last year's Project LIFEAT renewal request, LIFEAT coverage
' of the official Soviet installation was discontinued on 22 June 1960 when the.

# parallel{liaison)project LIENVOY assumed coverage of this target. In early
,. January. 1962 LIFEAT undertook coverage of the home phones of three of the
’ -most.active Soviet Intelligence officers. This was in response to the con-
tinuing Station.Cl program which includes the monitoring of Soviet contacts,
and the guidance received from KUDESK Staff at the time of the last LIFEAT
. renewal, As of this date, this coverage has not been active for sufficient

* time to fully evaluate its usefulness, However, it is believed that such
coverage has the potential to add materially to the Station's effort in the CI
field, Although not designed to provide positive intelligence, some by-product
-of this type has been obtained, Samples are as follows:

HMM-6364, 8 May 1962 (Briefing of Mexican Pro-Marxist Journalist
by Soviet Embassy)

HMM-6382, 15 May 1962 (Mexican Traveller to the USSR)

HMM-6376, 11 May 1962°(Refutation of Rumors that Soviet Cosmonaut
TITOV will visit Mexico)

Polish Embassy

LIFEAT has remained the primary source of information on this target and the
only successful, continuing penetration of the target. The information provided
to the interested Case Officer has in the past been described as "unique" and
“invaluable”, This description holds with equal emphasis for the present as
well as the past. Selective examples of the valuable positive intelligence pro-

. duct of this coverage are: :

-C, Cuban Coverage

LIFEAT was able to provide coverage of major firms dealing in U.S. goods
transshipment via Mexico to Cuba, This technical operation not only pro-
vided initial leads which alerted the Station to these companies, but also

was able to provide continuing information on the daily activities of the com-
panies involved, Coverage of certain Cuban personages arranging for illegal
transshipment of U.S. goods to Cuba was also provided including their con-
tacts and general activities, Samples of the positive intelligence production '
from this Cuban commercial coverage are as follows:

' E, Exile and Revolutionary Activities

_LIFEAT continues to provide information on the exile and revolutionary group
active in Mexico, which information is of the greatest value to the Station and
not available from other sources, The emphasis of the LIFEAT effort in this
area has been directed toward coverage of Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and mor
recently Spanish Republican exiles, The product has been most rewarding in ;
coverage, Examples of productivity in this past project year:
