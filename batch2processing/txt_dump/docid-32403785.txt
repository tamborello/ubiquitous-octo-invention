Dear Admiral Turner:

‘Thank you for your . kind letter of May 10, 1977, in
response to my letter of April 25, 1977. Itis reassuring to
know that you share the view of former GIA Director William
Colby that the now discontinued practice of the CIA employing

‘journalists as undercover contacts, compromises the integrity -
of the free press in America and that you will not allow it in
your administration either. :

: A free press, in my view, is essential to a free and
democratic society. The despicable practice in totalitarian
countries of employing government controlled journalists is as _
abhorrent to me as it is to the American Society of Newspaper
Editors.

Pursuant to your kind offer of complete cooperation,
may T ask you to inspect the list containing the names of forty
journalists, to which Mr. Colby referred, and, if you find among ©
the names journalists or feature writers who are presently covering
the work of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, inform
the appropriate editors of your findings. It would be appropriate, it~ _
seems to me, for you to encourage those editors to relieve such ~: a oom
journalists from their assignments related to the assassination probes.
I have no need to know the names of those on the list; I need only to
be assured that those who served the CIA during and after the period
under investigation by our Committee are not reporting or interpreting
the activities of the Committee to the American public today.

I Know that you share my concern about the need for
objective news reporting, and I look forward to hearing from
you regarding this request. :

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely yours,

STATEMENT

' Over the years, the CIA has had relationships with
individuals in many walks of American life. These
relationships, many of a voluntary and. unpaid nature, have
reflected the desire of Americans to help their country.
Such relationships have been conducted by the Agency with.
the clear intent of furthering its foreign intelligence
mission and have not been aimed at influencing or improperly |
acting on any American institution.

Genuine concern has recently been expressed about CIA
relations with newsmen and churchmen. The Agency does not
believe there has been any impropriety on its part. in the
limited use made of persons connected in some way with
American media, church and missionary organizations.
Nonetheless, CIA recognizes the special status afforded
these institutions under our Constitution and in order to

avoid any appearance of improper use by the Agency, the

HW 53217 Docld:32403785 Page 3
 

HW 53217

“DCI has decided on a revised policy to govern Agency
relations with these groups:

-- Effective immediately, CIA will not enter into.

any paid or contractual’ relationship with any oe

‘full-time or ‘part- time news correspondent

accredited by any U.S. news service, newspaper,

/ periodical, radio or television network or station.

-- As soon as feasible, the Agency will bring

existing relationships with individuals in: these

groups into conformity with this new policy. —

-- CIA has no secret paid or contractual relationship

with any American clergyman or missionary. This”

practice will be continued as a matter of policy.

CIA recognizes that members of these groups may wish
to provide information to the CIA on matters of foreign.
intelligence of interest to the U.S. Government. The CIA
will continue to welcome information volunteered by such
individuals.

It is Agency policy not to divulge the names of
cooperating Americans. In this regard CIA will not make-
public, now or in the future, the names of any cooperating

journalists or churchmen.
