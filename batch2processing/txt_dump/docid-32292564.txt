(Ca) A letter dated 8/20/66 from Rev. Father LOUIS T.
GREANIAS, Pastor of the Orthodox Church at 4501 West 103rd
St., Oak Lawn, Ill. 5 certified that ALEX was a respected member
of that congregation.

 

HEUBI mentioned that he had had a meeting with x
ALEX's legal representatives, including JOSEPH H. SHARLITT. ;
These individuals’ stated that in their opinion "the material
furnished the Swiss authorities by the American Embassy in
Bern" was not sufficient on which to base an entry ban. HEUBI
stated that he made a non-committal answer to this statement,
and did not indicate that any of the information in his
possession was obtained either from the Embassy or from the FBI.

 

 

 

 

 

SHARLITT further remarked that it was illegal
for a U. S. representative to furnish derogatory information
concerning a U. S. citizen to a foreign governtent.

Bureau is requested to inform if there is any
basis to. SHARLITT's-statement.

Bureau is further requested to inform if there is
any information in addition to that already furnished the Swiss
authorities which could be used by them as a basis to retain:
the entry ban against ALEX. It is felt that there would be
some benefit to the Bureau if ALEX could be kept out of Switzer-
land, since there is a possibility that he may attend to some
banking business when he is here.

Attorney, Zurich, who appears to be ALEX's present: legal counsel,
to the Swiss authorities stated that his client claims never to
have done anything which was not allowed or which would make him

Re Buairtel 7/27/66.

CHARLES HEUBI, Chief of the Service of Appeals,
Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police, stated that his
office had come to the conclusion that the Swiss authorities
did not possess sufficient proof of a legal nature to uphold:
the interdiction of entry into Switzerland against ALEX. HEUBI
noted that in his opinion this entrance ban had been instigated
by the Zurich Police in an effort to avoid the loss of manpower
and funds required to keep track of ALEX when he was in their
territory.

In the course of the conversation, HEUBI made
available pertinent sections of his file on ALEX which con-
tained items he thought might be of interest to the Bureau as
follows:

 

 

 

(1) A letter dated 5/15/65 from DR. Iur. HUGO
ROSENSTIEL and DR. Iur. ANDREAS GIRSBERGER, 8011 Zurich,
Taistr. 11, who appear to have been ALEX's former legal
representatives in Zurich. This letter forwards a birth certi-
ficate for ALEX, a police certificate stating that ALEX had:
no police record in Evergreen Park, Illinois and a police
certificate stating that ALEX had o_ eriminal record in Cook
County, Illinois. fy

it was his understanding that ALEX had no criminal record

into Switzerland on the basis of criminal behavior of an un-
desired foreigner. Senator DIRKSEN asked that ALEX be informed
of the basis for this action on the part of the Swiss authorities,
and asked that the Swiss government reconsider its decision.

(5) Signed statement of ALEX dated 10/20/66, in
which he explained that the discrepancies in his birth date were
caused by an error on the part of the midwife who delivered him.
He denied ever having been a bodyguard for anyone, and stated
that he was not responsible for rackets in the Chicago under-
world, nor was he a gang leader. He added that he was not the
owner of, nor did he -have an interest in any gambling casino,

syndicate. He was not a caporegima in the syndicate and was not .
nor ever had been in the past connected with prostitution.

Re your airtel 3/10/67.

Attached for information of Chicago Office are copies
of a communication from Legat, Bern, with respect to the
current status of the exclusion eyder which the Swiss.
authorities had previously imposed on Gus Alex. In view of the:
fact we have provided them with significant information in the.

’ past, it does not appear that providing them with any
additional information is at this tine warranted.

it is noted that Alex' Ss legal representative
allegedly advised a Swiss official that it was illegal for
aU. S. representative te furnish derogatery information
concerning a.U. &. citizen to a foreign government. For —
your information, the Bureau is unaware of any such
prohibition,
