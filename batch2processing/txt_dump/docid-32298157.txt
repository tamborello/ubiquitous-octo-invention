Deserptions of the two men were obtained by SA a
CARTER,

- After one of the men entered the apartment, SA

CARTER left the aparpbwanttat 8410 Fountain Avenue to endeavor
to obtain a license number of’ an automobile the two men might
have. He observed one of the two men enter a late model blue
Chevrolet Gorvette and drive hurriedly away. This car had no
license plate on front. The rear license plate was a Texas
plate, #Ec2400. It hung down on one side as if it was not
permanently affixed to the vehicle. The San Antonio office
has been requested to furnish registration data re this Texas
license plate.

 

SA CARTER did not observe if these men carried
anything from CAMPBELL's apartment. ;

SL

The above is furnished for the Bureau's informa-
tion. UACB, this office will not disseminate this informa-
tion to the LACSO, which has jurisdiction over this area
for the following reasons: 1. It is not known if CAMPBELL
will discover this burglary and this it would not be re-
ported, or if she does discover it, whether she will report
it. 2. The operation of the Los Angeles office in this
matter, which made possible thésobservation of the burglary,
is of an extremely sensitive nature. This office has made
very few open inquiries concerning CAMPBELL's activities so
that a highly confidential source, if developed, might prove u
more productive. It is my opinion that dissemination would
most likely jeopardize the entire operation.

The Bureau will be kept advised of any pertinent
information developed concerning this burglary.
