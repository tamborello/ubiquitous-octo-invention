In the event the allegations set forth in your memorandum dated .
March 6 1963 can -be established, it is our: opinion that the military enter-
prise which resulted in the capture by the Castro forces of the eight counter=

_ revolutionaries who had reportedly departed from South Florida, could con-

ceivably constitute a violation of Section 960. Accordingly, it is requested
that an appropriate investigation be conducted by the Bureau in this matter
under Section 960" or a conspiracy to violate that code section.
