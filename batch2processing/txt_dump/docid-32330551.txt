O7Ref.: Brid. Esp. Ext. No. 954 L/52-89
Y/Ref.: Communication 11922 Of the fourth of this {
month

With the communication mentioned in your reference
was enclosed was a photocopy of some information obtained
from the US Embassy in Paris concerning the captioned Cubans,
giving details about their records and activities in the
U.S. In reference with this matter, we have the following
to report: KO

Cuban citizen, Rolando Arcadio MASFERRER -ROJAS

‘ was born in Holguin (Oriente, Cuba) on January 12, 1918;
is married, a journalist and a lawyer. His physical
description and photograph are accurate. As is known,
in his youth he was attracted by communist ideas and
enlisted in a Cuban volunteer unit (almost all held the
same ideology), which fought with the then Spanish Red
Army. MASFERRER eventually became Political Commissioner
of the 46th Division, part of the Army Corps of the
famous Valentin GONZALEZ GONZALEZ, aka "el Compesino"
(the peasant). He fought at the Ebro Front. uw

 

In view of these activities during the war in
Spain, it is logical to assume that he does not wish to
return to Madrid, where his behavior is known. On the
other hand, his relations with former President General
BATISTA and his followers are not good any longer. As
was reported on June 2, there is no indication that he
; has entered Spain, at least as a Cuban citizen and under

 

this name. Inquiries at various inns and a review of the

aliens files of our Brigade confirmed this. The Cubans

of pro-Batista milieux have no knowledge of the former, -
Cuban senator's arrival in Spain. Because of his A(w) S

appearance and actions, he will/go unnoticed. H(t)

It appears that MASFERRER knew that he was in
difficulties with the American authorities. In order to
elude them, he resigned from the board of directors of
the "LIBERTAD" weekly, stating that he was leaving the
U.S.. territory in order to struggle more actively
against the CASTRO regime. It is then that the rumor
of his trtp to Spain must have started. However, it is
also said that he may be found in El Salvador, Haiti
or the Dominican Republic, engaged in some political
uprising project, of which he is so fond. It should be
noted that Senator MASFERRER is not on good terms with
the followers of General BATISTA and that he has planned —
always from places in the U.S. ~ future invasions of Cuba
and other operations of {a0 military nature. It was
said that for his training and that of his men he counted
on the cooperation of the CIA and of the famous "Green
Berets" of the US Army. Naturally, it is not known
just how true this information is; put it does illustrate
‘the point that many things are said about former Sena
MASFERRER, a man of action and evidently dangerous. BU)

Concerning his supposed companion, JULIO PALAU
ATON CONSTANZO or JULIO ATON CONSTANZO PALAU, we are
inclined to believe that his true name is Julio Anton
CONSTANZO PALAU, also an active individual and a dangerous
gunman. We have received information to the effect that
he was one of the members of the famous “Gatillo Alegre"
and, whose work in Cuba was the physical extermination
of political enemies; that is to say, an activity very
similar to that of Rolando MASFERRER. Some people say
that he was a lieutenant in the Rebel Army and that he
participated in gunfights, wounding the gunman known as
"E] Mejicano", Several violent deaths are attributed to
him, and he is considered to be mentally Gnbalaneed. SL)

The information in our Brigade’s files does
not reflect the fact that he has entered Spain. However,
one Pedro Alfonso CONSTANZO PALAU, born on 5/2/39 in
Palma Soriano (Oriente,Cuba), an®engineer, entered
Spain through Barajas airport on 12/27/66 and left through
the same airport for the U. §. on 6/20/67. He resided
in Lacorauna, at #18 Calle Ramon de la Sergra. Since
then, he has not entered this country again. Pedro lfonso
and Julio Anton CONSTANZO PALAU must be brothers. (00)
