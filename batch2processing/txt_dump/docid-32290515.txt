ANGELO BRUNO, aka ,

‘AR:

00: Phila.

Re New York teletype to Bureau 1/24/61 captioned
"MICHELINO CLEMENTE, AR," Bufile 92-2866 and Phila. letters
to.Bureau, ce New York, 1/13/61 and 1/18/61, enclosing con-
versation re BRUNO and ANTONIO POLLINA, aka, at Phila. .

Noted Phila. letter of 1/13/61, page 25, BRUNO
mentions CARLO GABBINO (ph) and TOMMY BARREN (ph) and it now
appears in view of New York tel that BRUNO probably made :
reference to CARLO GAMBINO and THOMAS LUCHESE, aka, TOMMY
BROWN. It appears that. BRUNO when classifying himself as a
"representative of the Commission" indicates he is a trusted
courier for the Commission. This is substantiated to a degree
by BRUNO's reference indicating he travels alone.

. PH 269-C in November 1957 traveled to Miami, Fla,
with BRUNO and was present when "approximately 25 individuals,"
unknown to informant, visited BRUNO separately in Golden Nugget
Motel, Miami Beach, and gave BRUNO money which filled a suitcase
and BRUNO thereafter returned with money to Phila. BRUNO told

 

& informant "runners" weekly bring money to Phila. from Miami. ;
