Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Act of 1992 (the Act)
Synopsis: The JFK Task Force requests each Headquarters Division
or Office to search their offices, storage areas, or archived
files for any documents or information related to President John
F. Kennedy’s assassination.

Details: In 1992, Congress signed the Act mandating federal
agencies to release all documents concerning the presidential

. assassination or information related by conspiracy theory to the
assassination. The Act narrowly defined the types of information
that agencies could still protect by postponement until the year
2017. The Act also established the Assassination Records Review
Board (the Board) as a separate entity to oversee the release of
material from the federal agencies to the National Archives and
Records Administration (NARA). Beyond the Board's oversight
responsibilities, the- Act charged the Board with the duties of
reviewing agencies’ proposed postponements with their evidence
for approval or denial and researching additional areas of
‘information for new material related to the assassination. The
FBI has been working with the Board since its inception to meet
the requirements of the Act.

On November 29, 1996, the Board wrote a letter to the
FBI setting forth a formal compliance: ‘program. The letter
- requested the FBI’s cooperation with the Board “in discharging its
responsibility of assuring Congress and the American people that
the goals of the JFK Act will be accomplished to the greatest
’ reasonable extent.” The compliance program is the Board's answer
to demonstrating “to the American public that a thorough, good-
faith, and diligent effort have been made to locate and release
all remaining assassination-related records within the control of
. the United States Government (and that the Government is not
hiding any such materials from public disclosure) ." With this
, philosophy in mind, the JFK Task Force met with the Board's FBI
staff researchers on January 15, 1997, to clarify the Board's
expectations of the FBI.
