WHITE and asked him to contact SAM GIANCANA to intercede
for informant against CARLOS MARCELLO, who has let it be

of the money he owes them, and because’ he knows that informant's
wife is using her political influence to push MARCELLO's
deportation He related that CHARLIE called someone called
"The Boot" (BOIARDO), and spoke to him in Italian in informant's
presence. Thereafter, CHARLIE told him that as long as he was
on the street he had nothing to worry about, as"The Boot"
would contact GIANCANA to put the word in to lay off. ,

As a pretext to induce CHARLIE WHITE to do this for

difficulties with the law. -

out. Informant told DEL MONICO that he would be down sometime
after 8/22/66.

On 8/30/65, NY 5642-C-TE advised SA THOMAS L. COLARELLI
that in his dispute with MARCLLLO over the money owed to him by
MARCELLO, he went to CHARLIE WHITE and asked him to explain his
situation to GIANCANA and collect the money for him. Later, he

. Called off the request as he knew that they would want a cut and

ke had decided to go after MARCELLO legally in the courts as his
attorney advised him that collection would be no problem.

The first week after Labor Day informant's attorney
is filing a suit against MARCELLO and informant expects that
MARCELLO will have to come to NY in this vegard.

Also in this regard, informant called RED PASSARELLI (PH

in Chicago to arramye a meeting with GIANCANA, Informant stated
that PASSARELLI runs the company that distributes Seaburg Juke
Box machines for GIANCANA. PASSARELLI advised that he would
call CHARLIE WHITE for verification to clear informant for a
meeting with GIANCANA in Chicago.

informant advised he wants to talk to GIANCANA
personally and explain his situation with MARCELLO. Informant
learned from PASSARELLI that the Chicago mob is having trouble
with MARCELLO in some of the juke box accounts controlled by
MARCELLO in Louisiana, which are suspected of being short.

Informant still plans to go to Miami and see CHARLIE
WHITE's son, CHUCK DEL MONICO, because he has other business
interests to attend to there and feels that he can “pump! CHUCK
for any information he may have.

Informant advised that he mistakenly associated
GIANCANA with MARCELLO in Puerto Pico gambling interests when
contacted on 8/18/66, because both have hidden interests in the
Tropicana in Las Vegas, Nevada. He could furnish no specific

hidden interest on GIANCANA's part in the casinos in Puerto
Rico.
