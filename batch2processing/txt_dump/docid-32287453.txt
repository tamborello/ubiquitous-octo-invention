ReBucab 6/30/70.(°

ReBucab indicates ALEX and wife departed for
Germany and Switzerland from New York City on 6/13/70.

. The Swiss Central Police Bureau was promptly
- . alerted, but no information has been received from them to
indicate ALEX and wife came to Switzerland. This is con-

. sidered highly unlikely, since Swiss have issued an entry
ban against him and put his name.on'the list of persons to
be checked if they arrive in Switzerland. His name would
therefore undoubtedly have been picked up at the airport
on arrival or in the hotel registry during his stay.
