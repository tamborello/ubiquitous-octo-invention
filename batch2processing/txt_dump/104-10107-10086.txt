1, Mr. Papich communicated by telephone at 10:00 a.m,:

i The New York office of the FBI has learned

: informally from an Assistant District Attorney
(unidentified) on Hogan's staff that the New York
District Attorney has received a complaint |
against Subject for abeconding with funds received —
from negligence cases. The allegation is that
Subject converted the settlements to his own use,

' did not pay them--less his own fees--to the cHents
| concerned, The complainant or complainants and
|

 

the lawyer or spokesman for them are not identified.
It is added, however, that whoever made the com-
plaint to the New York District Attorney alao
specified that there was reason to believe that
Subject was connected with a U.S. Agency. Lf this
was so, it was further indicated, complainants
would be willing to discuss the situation,

i telephone from New York, I asked him specifically for the identification~-
i if the FBI could make it--of the attorney or attorneys who made the
complaint to the New York District Attorney's office,

 

3. There was nothing in this communication to relate Subject's
case with the Itkin matter. However, it is clear thet the allegation made
