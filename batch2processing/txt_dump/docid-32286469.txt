It is noted that Subject's attorney, JORGE CASTILLO Z.,
has petitioned the Mexican Government to review their decision
not to grant Subject immigrant status in Mexico. He denies . t
that Subject has any relation with the underworld and claims
that, although he formerly was a part-owner of gambling casinos,
he has been retired since 1950. He claimed that since that time
Subject has been persecuted by the FBI, and contended that
Subject could not be a criminal because he has been residing
in the United States and has not been arrested by the FBI for
any crimes. He claimed that Subject had not returned to Mexico
since he was requested to leave in October of 1966 Le

Apparently, based on the inquiries being made in
Cuernavaca, CASTILLO contacted inspectors of Mexican Immigra~

unknown localities in Europe, t subsequently hinted that .
Subject was in Miami, Florida AN

It is noted that most Mexico City - Miami flights
go through Mexican Customs and Immigration Inspection at

reported indicated that Subject had been seen in Merida.
Sources have indicated that Merida is notorious for the
corruption in its Immigration and Customs inspections(, q
