MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with Congressional Committees on Disclosure
of Kennedy Assassination Records (U)

1. (U) On 10 April 1992, Kevin Powers, David McManis,
and the undersigned attended a meeting with staffers from the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee (SGAC) and the House
Government Operations Committee (HGOC) to discuss pending
legislation to provide for disclosure of government records
relevant to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
SGAC staffers present were Dr. Leonard Weiss, staff director,
and Steven Katz, counsel. HGOC staffers present were James C.
Turner, counsel; Robert Gellman, counsel; and Don Goldberg,
committee staffer.

2. (U) The purpose of the meeting was to inform NSA of
the committees’ interest in any material the Agency possesses
regarding the JFK assassination and Warren Committee
investigations. Bills have been introduced in both the House
and Senate (H.J. Res. 454 and S.J. Res. 282 respectively) to
establish an assassination materials review board that would
determine whether JFK assassination material provided to the
board by government entities should be immediately transferred
to the National Archives for public review or qualifies for
postponement of public disclosure. Documents will be
requested from the CIA, FBI, NSA, DOD, Department of State,
Warren Commission files, House Assassination Committee files,
Senate Church Committee files, and any other sources found to
maintain files on the JFK assassination.

3. —-eve-- Both Mr. Powers and Mr. McManis told the
staffers that they did not think that NSA's_holdings of
assassination material would be voluminous. They added that
after nearly 30 years it was likely that NSA holdings would be
limited to copies of published reports and responses to
queries posed by Congressional committees at the time. The
staffers noted that it was the committees' intent to push for
the declassification of as much relevant material as possible.

4. (U) Hearings on the bills are scheduled for 28 April
and 14 May in the House committee and on 12 May in the Senate
committee. Copies of the bills have been provided by the
committees to the Legislative and Regulatory Counsel for

separate comment.
