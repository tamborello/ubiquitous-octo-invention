Previous New Haven information submitted in this matter has
indicated that FRANK LEWIS’PICCOLO, a highly placed racketeer
in the Bridgeport, Connecticut, area, is possibly connected
with the THOMAS/LUCHESE family eeroueh ANTHONY/CASTALDI, aka
. Tony Higgins, or with the INO family inasmuch as
FRANK PICCOLO's name was fuund among the personal effects
of CARLO GAMBINO. The purpose of this communication is to
point out additional evidence which has been developed
strongly indicating that PICCOLO is very likely connected
with the CARLO GAMBINO family through an association with
JOSEPH ARCURI, whom New York sources report is a "Captain"
in the CARLO GAMBINO family of the CAUSA NOSTRA, . .

On June 29, 1962, Confidential Source MM 802-cC reported

that the name FRANK PICCOLO, 220 East 23rd Street, with
Telephone Number MU 9-0160, was found among the personal
effects of CARLO GAMBINO in that his name was found on a
business card for the-Consolidated Research and Manufacturing
Corporation, 1184 Chapel Street, New Haven, Connecticut,
MARVIN BOTWICK, President,

It is known and it has been reported to the Bureau and

New York that PICCOLO has admitted to two agents of the

New Haven Division that he was associated in business with .
the Consolidated Research and Manufacturing Corporation, | /
which at one time had offices both in New York and in New fe
Haven, as a salesman. PICCOLO further advised that his ~
office in New York City with the Consolidated Research
Corporation was located at 220 East 23rd Street.

It ‘is known through interviews with MARVIN BOTWICK, former
President of Consolidated Research, now deceased, that: NO:
BOTWICK had personal. relations with PICCOLO and strongly’ werd
indicated that PICCOLO had offered the Consolidated’ ‘Research
Corporation financial. assistance.

 

On December 21, 1962, Special Agent WINTHROP A, YOUNG of - o, ‘
New .Haven contacted PCI ANTHONY TESTO in Bridgeport, . ‘Conn—
ecticut, who furnished the. following | information: ,

Recently ANGELO /CULMO ,. allegedly the. head ‘man’, ‘Of. the Co
rackets in Ansonia, Connecticut, died.and there was con- ~~"

’  gternation as to who would: “replace hin, On December 22, -
1962, the son of ANGELO CULMO and NICHOLASYPATTI, also . .
from the Ansonia, . Connecticut , area, came/to the. informant's ‘
place of business along with FRANK ’ ‘PICCOLO. * ‘Several tele- -
phone calls were made from informant's ‘teleplioné by PICCOLO ‘

- who remarked to the informant that he was ‘straightening . out -

the Ansonia situation, .as to who should have control, _Tn- :
formant . believed the calls were to New York.” os
It was determined that only two toll calls to New York -
City were madé on December 20, 1962, from informait' Ss °  -
phone and’ both were to New ‘York, Number 212 = RE 77-1588. ed

 

The New York Office determined that RE. ‘7-1588 is listed ‘to fey t
thexArcurd Liquor Store, 302 East 78th Street, New YorkCity,/ ;
the owner of this store is JOSEP! BY, Shh East East oo
76th, Street, New York City. : .
ENS, ee eal

 

  

oon January, 1963, NY 3864-2-TE advised “ARCURI is a "Captain" -
~ in the CARLO GAMBINO -family of LA CAUSA. NOSTRA. = . ;

Additional. investigation conducted ‘in. this matter by the :
New Haven Division indicated that ANG: JR. , is. in
control of the rackets in’ Ansonia, _ Connecticut. =

From the above it is highly conjecture tthat PICCOLO is
associated with the: GAMBINO > family an es the. LUCHESE
family.
