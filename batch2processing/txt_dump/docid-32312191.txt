NEUTRALITY MATTERS

On December 2, 1963, a confidential source
- abroad brought to the attention of the Federal Bureau :
' of Investigation a news article which appeared in the:
"Miami Herald," Miami, Florida, on September 22, 1963,
claiming that the British Honduras border was being |
used for the infiltration of Communist revolutionaries
into. Latin America. According to this source, this
article was later the basis for a report in the
"Belize Billboard," which echoed the view of the opposition
party in British Honduras. (at that.time accusing the — .
' government of having pro-Communist. sympathies) and which
was allegedly designed to embarrass the government,

 

Also, according to the source, the Government \
of British Honduras subsequently issued a ‘statement to
the effect that the security authorities. of that govern=
ment were not aware of any evidence to confirm that the
country was being used by Communist agents, and requested
.. the "Miami Herald" to furnish confirmation of the allega- -
oo. tions contained in the article appearing on September 22, '
‘=, 1963, The "Miami Herald" reporter who had written the ' :
article replied that his story was based on information
received from the Cuban Student Directorate, which is
identical with the captioned organization, located | at , 4 ;
