regard to she Atlanta convention, is the matter of

the peuyie in Atlanta will permit desegregation

of the hotels during the NAACP convention, but
both before and aitter the convention will not

make a change in the segregation policy. In other
words, tins cegrage tion will be lifted while the

Next BASSETT recapped the developments in
civil righss Dy the NAACP since 1952, He indicated
that the NAACP national yolicy has been to serve as
a brake on the aggressive tendencies of the member-
ship. This tendency has been evidenced in the
resolutions submitted at the previous conventions.
Now the NAACP leadership finds itself in a position
in which they have to examine this situation.
BASSETT brought out the fact that directives have
been issued by the National Office of the NAACP
which only give lip service to the resolutions
submitted to and accepted by the convention. He
said that they never put themselves in a position
in which they could be charged with not doing what
the convention passes on, but they do it in such
away that it is ineffective. He cited as an
example the fact that the last convention had
called for the issuance of an emancipation
proclamation and noted that such a proclamation
was issued, but it was a watered-down version.

BASSETT further mentioned that the youth

had been able to win some concessions in 1960, but
were not nearly so successful in the 1961 convention,

= He stated that. 2,000 delegates were
expected to attend the 1962 convention and that
the theme of the 1962 convention would be the
fight for the ballot and for job opportunities.

During the discussion on the NAACP Convention,
it was brought out thet the Party finds itself
in the same situation that it was in last year,
prior to the convention, ‘That is, that the Party
. forces have not gotten together and, therefore,
the Party must operate at the coming convention
without the cooperation and ‘coordination necessary
to effectively influence the convention.

The informant reported that WILLIAM
PATTERSON spoke and in his remarks indicated that
there is a crisis in the Negro movement. He
spoke of things that the Party has done, but in
which the Party has not made any organizational
gains. PATTERSON stated that the CP has been
able to get a lot of things moving, but through
ort this, the Party has not made any orcanizational
gains,

BENJAMIN DAVIS also spoke and Stated that
although the CP influence is felt, "we" do not make
gains. "We are reduced to the characterization of .
Communist professors, 2 we cannot take an
organization like the NAACF and cannot solve its
problems, then we are not going to make it."

DAVIS pointed out that, "How can you
explain year after year the activities and maneuverings
of the.various NAACP Conventions, in which people are in-
fluenced undercover, and yet after which we are never
any better off in facing the next convention than we
were before the last convention? Somewhere along the
