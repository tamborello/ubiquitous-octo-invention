of Orleans Parish. They are set out as follows:

On 3~20-63 Aaron M. Kohn, Managing Director, Metro=~
politan Crime Commission, New Orleans, advised there was no
indication that Garrison, as District Attorney, was involved
in any illegal graft. However, on 2=28-G65 Kohn said he had
received information that Pershing Gervais, Chief Investigator
of the New Orleans District Attorney's office, was involved in
a bribery situation, Gervais was a controversial appointment |
of Garrison's as he had been dismissed from the New Orleans
Police Department in 1950 for conduct unbecoming an officer,
Both are close personal friends based on World War II military
service. (62~9-33=381; 62=-9-33~530)

 

NO 1227~C-TE advised he had been arrested in February,
, 1965, charged with pandering. Subsequently, on 3=186865 he was
4 contacted by a representative of the New Orleans District
r Attorney's office and told that for $2,000 the case against
: him would be dropped, This source had previously advised a
i Louisiana State Legislator had been interceding for a well-known
; New Orleans madam and he learned from this madam that for
$10,000 the New Orleans District Attorney's office would not
prosecute her or her prostitutes. (66~6353=2874)

 

On 7-27~66 NO 1439=C advised District Attorney Garrison
allegedly had purchased a bar in New Orleans and set up one
Jackie Lee as manager. Lee, according to the source, is a
homosexual. Source also said that Garrison is known to have
associated with prostitutes in New Orleans, (62-9-33-617)

NO 1390-PC advised on 10=-21-66 he had learned that
Carlos Marcello on at least one occasion in the past had paid
round-trip air transportation for Garrison to Las Vegas,
Nevada, Garrison; while in Las Vegas, stays at the Desert Inn
Hotel and his bills are paid by that hotel,

| Marcello is a New Orleans gambler and La Cosa Nostra
; hoodlum, He recently attended a meeting with twelve other
hoodlums in New York City 9-22-66, which received wide-spread
publicity in the New York City area. On 9-30-66 he assaulted
: a Special Agent of the FBI and is awaiting Federal trial on
this charge,

NO 1309-C has told the New Orleans Office that
Garrison is politically ambitious and plans to run for Lieutenant
Governor in Louisiana during the Fall of 1967, (137-14333-5;
