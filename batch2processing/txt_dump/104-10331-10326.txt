2: [Request] Were there any audio “pugs” in the Cuban
Embassy and/or Consulate?

3. Goodpasture Interview: According to Gunn,
Goodpasture says there was a working copy of Oswald's
telephone conversation tape. She heard it and believes it
might have been taken to Dallas by the FBI. She also wrote
some “protest” letters | concerning linking the unidentified
man with Oswald.

{NOTE: Goodpasture's comments ties in with Hoover's
comments, which were later denied, that Dallas FBI agents
listened to a tape of Oswald calls; also Warren Commission
staffer Slawson remembers listening to an Oswald tape. To
date we have found no evidence in the JFK collection that
such a tape existed. Also I am not aware of any “protest”

. letters from Goodpasture. }

[Request] Marwell ask if there were records that would show
if such “working tapes” were made?

4. Gunn would like to make a joint (CIA/ARRB) visit to
the JFK and LBJ Presidential Libraries in February.
