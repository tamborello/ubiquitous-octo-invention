CONFIRMED INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NUMBER OF SOVIETS IN cuBA.
SOME ARE LEAVING BUT SOME ARE ALSO ARRIVING. SOURCE IS NOT AWARE
OF ANY SOVIET INFANTRY OR ARNORED COMBAT UNITS. PRESENTLY IN CUBA. —
HE STATED THAT ANY UNITS WHICH MAY HAVE FITTED THIS CATEGORY LEFT
WITH THE IRBM’S IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 1962, HE IS CERTAIN THAT _
ALL IRBM'S AND BOMBERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT.)

2. CASTRO CONTINUES TO BE UNHAPPY WITH THE SOVIETS AND WILL
NEVER FORGET THE TREATMENT HE RECEIVED FROM THEM IN THE FALL OF 1962.
CASTRO IS MUCH CLOSER TO THE CHINESE LINE BUT REALIZES HE CANNOT
EXIST WITHOUT SOVIET AID. HE INSISTS THAT THE CUBANS BE TRAINED
AND ASSUME CONTROL OF ALL SOVIET EQUIPMENT IN CUBA. BECAUSE CASTRO
BECOMES ENRAGED OVER BEING CALLED ANYONE'S STOOGE AND FEELS SO
STRONGLY AND PROUD OF THE INDEPENDENT POSITION HE HAS TAKEN, SUCH
AS NOT AUTHORIZING GROUND INSPECTION AND NOT SIGNING THE PARTIAL
TEST BAN TREATY, IT IS BELIEVED TAAT HE WILL INSIST THAT THE SOVIETS
LEAVE WHEN TEE CUBANS ARE TRAINED AND CAN HANDLE THE EQUIPMENT.

3. MIG-19 PILOTS HAVE BEEN TRAINED _IN BOTH THE SOVIET UNION
AND CHINA. SOME, SUCH AS PRENDES AND“ VERONITA (SIC), RECEIVED .
MIG-21 TRAINING EARLY IN CUBA AND MORE PILOTS ARE PRESENTLY TRAINING
IN CUBA, (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: PRENDES IS PROBABLY CAPTAIN ALVARO
PRENDES QUINTANA; VERONITA IS POSSIBLY IDENTICAL WITH CAPTAIN ENRIQUE

VARONA,) THE MIG-21'S ARE CONTROLLED BY THE CUBANS, BUT THE SOVIETS
REMAIN AS ADVISERS. : : :

4. THE KOMAR VESSELS ARE CONTROLLED AND MANNED BY THE CUBANS

WITH SOVIET ADVISERS.
5. THE CUBANS ARE BEING TRAINED TO HANDLE THE CRUISE MISSILES.

 

(HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: SQURCE IS NOT CERTAIN BUT BELIEVES THAT THE
CRUISE MISSILES ARE ALREADY UNDER CUBAN CONTROL.)

6. THE CUBANS ARE NOW RECEIVING CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION IN THE
OPERATION OF SAM'S IN PINAR DEL RIO, THE SAM'S ARE STILL UNDER
SOVIET CONTROL.

7. THE CUBANS ARE ALSO RECEIVING COMMUNICATIONS AND RADAR
TRAINING. CASTRO HAS TAKEN ENGINEERING STUDENTS OUT OF THE UNIVER-
SITY OF HABANA FOR TRAINING, WHICH IS INDICATIVE OF TE iL?ORTANCE
HE ATTACHES TO THE TRAINING OF CUBANS AND THEIR ASSUMING CONTROL.

8. THE CUBAN ARMY IS ORGANIZING AN. ARMORED DIVISION WHICH
WILL BE UNDER THE COMMAND OF MAJOR ASEVEDO. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT:
POSSIBLY IDENTICAL WITH ROGELIO ACEVEDO GONZALEZ WHO WAS PROMOTED
TO MAJOR IN EARLY JANUARY 1363.) NEW TANKS WITH INFRARED. FIRING
DEVICES HAVE ARRIVED IN CUBA WITHIN THE PAST TAREE TO FOUR MONTHS,
IT IS ASSUMED THAT TEESE TANKS AxE FOR THIS DIVISION.

9. NO SOVIET TROOPS HAVE PARTICIPATED OR ARE PARTICIPATING IN

THE CUBAN ARMY ANTI- INSURGENT OPERATIONS IN THE MOUNTAINS. REGULAR |

ARMY DIVISIONS ARE PERMANENTLY STATIONED aT CAMPS THROUGHOUT THE

ISLAND, AND MILITIA DIVISIONS ARE ORGANIZED OR ACTIVATED AS THE NEED
ARISES.
