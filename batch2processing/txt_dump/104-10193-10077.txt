1. The officers of the Intelligence Watch (wy performed
admirably in swiftly processing the heavy flow of intelligence |
- engendered by the fécent political upheaval in Chile, In many
instances, reports were, in the hands of customers in’ the intel-
-ligence community within minutes of being filed in Santiago,

“2. Please ‘extend to the Iw officers concerned the appre~
ciation of this Division for their fine performance. I suggest that
a copy of this memorandum; -be placed in the personnel folder of

~ 1.. I would solicit Career Management Group and the Promotion Panel a

to consider.the overall career of Calvin W. Hicks when deciding on the | cur-
rent cycle ot promotions from Gs- i3-to ‘GS-14, :

  

’ After Mr. Hicks- EOD in ‘1980; Ke ‘advanced rapidly f in three years .
to GS- al ‘Hes ‘was promoted to GS8- 12-40 1956, six years later to. GS-13 in

1962, and. Since then has been almost 12 years in gfade...He has had over-

” seas tours with FE and NE Divisions, has served ds a training instructor, on,

“a PM task, force, and with Miami Ops and area branches in WH. In these
‘assignments he. consistently received Strong, ratings. Despite a largely para~ 7

- military background, .in 1967 he adjusted to. the ‘Intelligence production‘cycle.
-and developed thé skills. of an operations officer doing operations=orlented |

reports work in the Intelligence Watch. As of this date he has the longest

  

 

 

continuity in‘the Intelligence Watch and is rated as a mature and thoughtful
"individual whe; exercises excellent. professional judgment. He was recom=
_mended for. promotion. from GS-13 to GS-14"in April 1968 and in April 1969.
vIn 1970 he was: recommended” for a QSI-by:FI Chief, Peer deSilva, He was.

‘again recommended for piomotion ‘in ‘March 197-1, in November 1972, and ih

November 1973,

. 3. ‘Admittedly, promotions are competitive and the rankings are rela~
tive and must be adjusted to the headroom available, The overall history of
-his career would seem to argue the. equity, of granting the often recommended
promotion to Mr, Calvin Hicks as he nears:the end of a career. Mr. Hicks is
49 years old and has:a, family of five children, He has a medical hold which
wili not allow him to serve overseas at this time and he therefore, contem~
plates retirement at age 50 (in late 1974), He is and will be until then a
valuable member of the Intelligence Watch.

4, [recommend that the promotion which has escaped him in the last
decade be granted at the time of this year's promotion cycle. :

‘1. I would again like to recommend ‘the promotion ‘of ‘subject officer from
Gs-13 to GS-14, Mr. Ricks ‘hag been with the Intelligence Watch since June 1967
_ and his performance has been characterized. consistently. by- exceptional proficiency. -.
He serves en a rotating schedile with seven other officers: “doing. identical work, ot

. Soine of whom are currently in GS-1

7 2. A medical’ hold has precluded any further.« overseas assignnents and for
this reason his stay in, IW has been- extended until November 1974, when he will’
be 50-years-old at which time he: plans ‘to retire under the “Agency retirement

system,

3. Mr. Hicks" resourcefulness and ‘ability to apply the ‘multitude ‘of
ereh ah instructions and ‘techniques have been convincingly demonstrated in
oot cerisis situations such as the recent Chilean coup and the Middle-Eastern crisis. |
we He. fas ‘consistently displayed initiative and. good judgment: in meeting unforeseen
' crisis with rapid, and effectiVe action and has clearly demonstrated his ability
to continuously adjust te ‘rotating shifts and the irregular flow of traffic.

.. 4 For his sustained high level of performance in 1972 Mr. Hicks received
a quality step increase in- recognition and as proof of the high esteem in which
he_is held by his superiors. “He occupies a GS-14 slot. His promotion ‘is again ~
recommended in recegnition of his: Yong years of Agency service. -
