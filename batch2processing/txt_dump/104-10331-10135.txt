SUBJECT: ARRB Request: Alvarado Polygraph tapes
- (sent to Lee 1/28/97)

Alvarado Ugarte, a Nicaraguan, is a key figure in the Oswald/Mexico City investigation. He was
interrogated (including polygraph) jointly by the Mexican Police and CIA. Extensive information about
the interrogation, including the Agency's written Polygraph report (IRD#66032), has been released to the
public under the JFK Act. Copies of the polygraph tapes were found in the FBI's JFK files and referred
to the HRG. The ARRB staff has requested the release of the tapes.

Does the DA /OS have any objection to release of the tapes? Listening to the tapes will require

some old equipment. According to the file, the tapes should play back satisfactorily on a 60-cycle
machine (reel-to-reel) utilizing 60-cycle current.

JFK reviewer Joe Murphy (31842) is the HAG focal point for this request] waa
C/IRB, OS has been our point of contact for JFK request in the past. If you have any questions about

this request, please give me a call (31825).
