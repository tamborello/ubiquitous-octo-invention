A source furnished the following information to a
representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on
February 19, 1968: .

   
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
    
 
 
  
  

This source advised that he and his wife were in
San Juan, Puerto Rico from December 2 ~ 15, 1967. He stated
; that the lastes of the last week of his trip, around December
lg 13, 1967, he was sitting in the lobby of the Holiday Inn, half
4 asleep and overheard a conversation, in English, between two
Negro couples.

This source advised that it appeared that the couples
had prearranged plans to meet at the Holiday Inn, possibly to
eat, and source does not believe that they were registered, as
he did not see them before or after.

The source said that from the conversation, at least
One couple appeared to be from California, as they were comment-
ing and comparing Governor Reagan to the fox omer Governor Brown.

' Source could recall no descriptive’ information con-
cerning one of the couples, but he stated that the man who did

‘most of the talking was approximately 6'3" to 6’4" in height,
and had on a black hat that flopped down on one side. The woman
with him was extremely well dressed, short and heavy set.

The Negro man doing the talking stated a Negro, supposed-

- ly an associate of Martin Luther King, Jr., and formerly 2n open

oN advocate of violence, was to "hit" King during the Washington March
. this spring, so as to place the blame on a white man inthe march,

By "Hit", the source took this as to kill King. This Ancidént was
to be used to ineite full scale rioting.

This. source advised that he had not wanted to get, involved,
thus the delay in reporting this matter to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. He stated that no one else overheard the conversa-
tion.
