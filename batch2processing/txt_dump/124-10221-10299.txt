RE a LE _ARDO DE 1

DE ARMAS and that for his own reasons CASTRO wanted a number

_of revisions made in the tape. CASTRO's attitude implied that he
was permitting the DE ARMAS news release and pointed ou hat
that release was purely voluntary on DE ARMAS' part. AL)

DE ARMAS recalled, that again on his own, he made a .
statement at the beginning of the press conference in which he :
remarked that the statements he was making were voluntary. His
interview with CASTRO lasted for approximately twenty minutes and
he expressed a completely willing and positive.attitude to CASTRO
in the release of the press conference. He did not object in any
way to the revisions which CASTRO had found necessary. DE ARMAS'
impression from his interview with CASTRO was that CASTRO attempted
to convey the impression to him that he or the Cuban Government were
doing DE ARMAS a favor in permitting him to make the press release.

At this point in the interview, DE ARMAS explained (Ay
that he did not feel that the information that he furnished in
the press release was of any great damage to the United States
Government in that it contained many obvious untruths a
misinformation. As an example, he purposely identi fieeptie >

|
FRED DUNCAN as an loyee of the CIA when he is actually |
an snpreyee of pen ise reiterated that his motivation throughou u)
al is activity was to ingratiate himself with the Cuban i

Government in order to place himsélf in a position whereby

he could be of assistance to the United States Government. DE ARMAS
accepted full responsibility for all g is actions as. |
noted throughout this entire affair.

  
 

BPARMAS noted that he had made some comments concerning:
j “whom he identified as a Cuban exile who left

—L rs g the revolution and is connécted with the
Anti-CASTRO news media. DE ARMAS did not know MARTINEZ ‘and

was simply briefed on his activities by Cuban Intelligence, which
information was reflected in his news release. He also referred to

a sole eebietatl ss in the same context. He recalls having -
identiffed MARTIN nd POLIEO as He referred

that Abdala considered MASFERR Oo its efforts and

had formulated plans for his assassination. The possibility of

planting C-4 plastic explosive in his automobile was explored.

after a number of discussions, of which DE ARMAS was privy,

someone in Abdala made the statement to forget about the

plans to kill MASFERRER. DE ARMAS stated that shortly thereafter

MASFERRER was killed when his automobile was bombed. After the

bombing, Mr. ROBERT MILLS of the FBI Miami, approached DE ARMAS and
inguired as to any information he may have as to the bombing and whether

he was personally involved in it. DE ARMAS advised MILLS of the discussions
within ABDALA concerning the possible assassination of } SFERRER but

denied any direct knowledge ‘of MASFPERRER's murder. fA) : : |

 

Cuban Intelligence were aware that DE ARMAS was affiliated
with Abdala and they also believed that he had direct knowledge of
the MASFERRER killing. As a result, during his debriefings, DE_ARMAS
attributed the receipt of plastic explosjye C-4 from BOB MILLS (whom ae
he purposely identifiedfa a CIA officer sg)Then he claimed that he gave(U)
the explosives to Abdala‘with the implication that Abdala was
responsible for MASFERRER's murder. ¢€

 

   
     

 

; DE ARMAS claimed that an individual named
although claiming to be an anti-Castro Cuban in the Miatii "EL
dréa, is a close personal friend of CASTRO and RAUL CASTRO. He is .

by the Cuban Community in Miami. MOULION took the position
publicly that the full story concerning DE ARMAS had not come to .

at the time. About 3 days after his defense of DE ARMAS, _
his automobile was bombed. with the result that MOULION 4 .
