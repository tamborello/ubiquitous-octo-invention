WASUINGTON, O.C. 20510

September 23, 1975

HAND DELIVERED

Mr. James J. Hitchcock

Bureau of Intelligence and Research —
U. S. Department of State

Washington, D. C. 20520

Dear Mr. Hitchcock:

This is to confirm the request I made to you on the
phone this afternoon. As I mentioned on the phone, it would
be greatly appreciated if you could supply ans information
that may be in State Department files concerning the travel
of Dr. Sidney Gottlieb to the Congo (now Zaire) in 1960.

Dr. Gottlieb was, at that time, an cnnphoyee of the
CIA. The CIA Review Staff has informed me that Dr. Gottlieb
often travelled funder State Departuent cove) As I indicated
today, the Comnittee has received documents from the CIA
which raise the possibility that Dr. Gottlieb travelled to
the Congo from Washington, D. C., arriving approximately on
September 27, 1960. ie probably travelled to Brazzaville and
immediately made his way to Leopoldville. It also appears
that the person in question -- probably Dr, Gottlieb --
dgparted from Leopoldville for the United States on October 5,

 

 

 

The Committee would be interested in any record of
such a trip that might be derived from a review of passports

issued to Dr. Gottlieb (either in his true nane or under alias)

or from any more detailed travel records that might be on

_file, such as personnel orders, travel documents, and any

pertinent cables.

Phone. I look forward to hearing From you, AZ
