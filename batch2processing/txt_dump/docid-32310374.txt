It is felt by the Los Angeles Division that
interviews with SCHEIB and KAVNER should only be con-
ducted after all of the allegations in this matter have
been investigated. It is noted that LA 4350 advised
that KAVNER is shrewd, and probably got money to pay
off his loan at the Erie Bank through a mortgage on
his. house or another loan, and is probably paying off
the indebtedness incurred in this latter financing with
money he obtained out of the SCHEIB deal. The St. Louis
Division is presently conducting investigation on this
phage of the allegation regarding any loans on KAVNER's
property, although it has been previously reported that
KAVNER paid off the loan with part of the stock he put
up as collateral. To date, the Los Angeles Division has ‘
not been able to show that KAVNER put up any stock as
collateral for a loan which had not previously belonged A

oO him.

The alleged flight by KAVNER and SCHEIB to
San Francisco will only be able to be verified upon inter-
view with SCHEIB and through the cooperation of SCHEIB
to make his records available.

ANTHONY DORIA's financial situation during the
past year does not appear to be one of grandeur, although
any "payoff" made to him on the SCHEIB deal could have
come after the foreclosure proceedings on his house.
Mortgage payments being made by NICK NARDI on the property
formerly in DORIA's name are being traced at this time.

It has been ascertained that the transfer of
SCHEIB workers from Local 886, International Workers
Federation of Labor, as their bargaining agent, to Teamsters
Local 495, took place as of 9/1/61 through interviews with
SCHEIB employees and former employees. These employees
were aware of this transfer, even though they may have been
ignorant as to their rights in the matter.

- The "TONY" as mentioned by LA 4350, has been
identified as COSMO ANTHONY TUCCELLI,. the night bartender
at Delmonico's Restaurant, which is owned by SCHEIB.
TUCCELLI could be involved as a middleman in payoffs by
SCHEIB to KAVNER, but it has previously been reported
that SCHEIB knew DORIA as far back as 1954; therefore, it
is unlikely SCHEIB got involved with DORIA through TUCCELLI.

The Los Angeles Division is presently checking
EARL SCHEIB's personal and business bank accounts, tax
return of Delmonico, Inc. for 1960 (when available), tracing
telephone calls which took place during the period of the
alleged dealings, and is attempting to ascertain a connection
between SCHEIB and TUCCELLI regarding the current allegations.
Alsagugh,it is felt that investigative results obtained from
contemplated techniques to be used in Los Angeles file
92-745, entitled "ANTHONY DORIA", may very well assist _
materially in bringing captioned case to a logical conclusion,

At the present came ene Department of Labor is

conducting an audit of Local 886, and the results of this
audit will be made available to the Los Angeles Division.
