ee ROBERT F. WILLIAMs' "SECOND EXILE"
“Afro-American Leader in Prile Leaves Quba for China

by RICHARD GIBSON
ert FoWilliams, Chairman-in~Exile of the militant all--black
Revolutionary Action Movement in the United States, has left Fidel.
Castro's Ouba for what he calls a "second exile” in China.

, former President of the Union County, North Carolina Branch of

x

che National Association for the Advancement of ' Colored People (NAACPY
Wiliiams, who is now 41 years old, fled to Cuba in 1961 when local

. police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation sought to arrest hin.
' 64 charges of kidnapping a white couple during a racial clash in
Williams’ hometown of Monroe, N.C, :

 

¢

In those days, one of the proudest boasts of Cuba's revolution-
ary leaders was that they had wiped out racial discrimination on the
island, and it certainly seemed to be true. Although few black

were among the leaders of the revolution, the revolution
Skiy gained support from the country's large black population, -
d in the United States, it was no accident that Fidel Castro re- *
eeived an enthusiastic welcome from the blacks of Harlem in 1960,
while anti-communist whites picketed everywhere else he went in New
York City. It was no accident that Robert F, Williams should flee
to Cuba to continue his struggle. -4e had been one of the founders
of the now-defunct Fair Play for Cuba Committee in the United
Sates, eight of whose original 30 founding members were Negroes;
ancluding such well-known writers as James Baldwin, Julian Mayfield -
and John Killens. Such Negro participation in a movement not directly
related to the civil rights struggle was virtually unprecedenged.

After his arrival in Havana, where -é was joined shortly there

after by his wife, M and thelr two young sons, Williams resumed
publication of his monthly newsletter, The Crusader, in April 1962
and at length persuaded the Cuban Government to allow him to braad~
cast to the United States several times weekly over Cuba's "Radio

| Progreso." He called his program "Radio Free Dixie" and its tone

} was set in Williams’ first broadcast on July 27, 1962, the day after
k grandiose celebrations of the ninthanniversary of the beginning cf
| the Cuban revolutionary struggle against the Batista regimes "Tre

But on August 8, 1966, Williams remarked bittered at a rally in
Peking: "Some so-called Socialists, we thought to be comrades and
cless brothers, have joined the international Ku Klux Klan fraternity
for white~supremacy world domination. To our consternation, we have
discovered that the bourgeols-oriented power structure of some .
Socialist States, even one with a black and white population, would
prefer to preserve the white reactionary anti-communist power
séructure in racist America, their natural national enemy, than to
see a just, democratic, fraternal Socialist State brought about by -
the revolutionary action of oppressed blacks that would serve the

  

  

arts that they love to ape so well, even to the point of emulating —.
their racism, they are moving might and main to frustrate and defeat
the revolutionary movements of the oppressed peoples throughout the
worlds . Ls .

 

The Dream of the OPUSA . see

The rally had been called to celebrate the third anniversary
of Mao Tse-tung's "Statement Calling on the People of the World to
Unite to Oppose Pacial Discrimination by U.S. Imperialism and Support
the American Negroes in their Struggle against Racial Discrimination,
ade on August 12, 1963 in reply to a request by Williams, Although”
iven extensive coverage in the intermational press, The Worker ands.
ther publications of the U.S. fommunist Party ignored Mao‘s State-
ent. Williams had never been close to the CPUSA and the Party's
eaders Made no secret of their fear that the black militancy that
jiiliams and the late Malcolm ¥ weve advocating might destroy for-
ver the Party's lingering hopes for a "“Negro~Labor Alliance" that
ight eventvally dominate the Amcrican political scene, ‘

  

 

. In the years between 1962, when Williams arrived in Havana, and
i966, when he left for China, there had been occasional signs of per-—
sisting racial antagonisms in Cuba. Mhere.remains open social pre-
