SUBJECT:

ReBulet to New Orleans, 7/30/68.

On 8/27/68, a review of ‘the mowue of the Laredo Times,
of the articles printed localiy in connection with the trial}og
the subject in Laredo in May 1968, failed to show any stateme:
made by’ the subject or any of his * attorneys concerning investi
ments by the subject in Mexico. It should be noted that the}
Laredo Times is the only English language. daily newspaper
printed in Laredo.

   
 
  
  

On 9/10/68, SA 496-C, a confidential source in

Mexico, advised that he read;most of the articles printed in
Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, newspapers concerning the subject and he
did not recall that any of them made any mention of any invest
ments in Mexico by the subject. He.said that due to his

position in Mexico, he had an interest in the subject and :
especially in any information which might reflect any invest- ©
ments by the subject in Mexico.

: On. 9/23/68, BARRY BROWNE, former reporter for the
' Laredo Times, advised that he had written most of the articles
for the Laredo Times concerning the subject while the subject
was in Laredo, Texas, on trial. He could not recall any
articles in any local newspapers mentioning the fact that the
subject had any investments in Mexico. Portions of the article
in the 5/30/68, issue of La Prensa newspaper were read to
him and he stated that about the only truth in the article was
_ that MARCELLO was on trial in Laredo.

. HU 326 ;
NOTE: LEGAT Mexico City reports an article appeared in the
Mexico City Spanish language newspaper, “La Prensa," concerning
Marcello's recent trial in Laredo, Texas, for assaulting an FBI
Agent. This article quoted Marcello&s attorney as stating
Marcello had investments in a firm in Mexico. LEGAT advises this
firm to be largely controlled by Bruno Pagliai and his associates.
. Pagliai is a naturalized Mexican citizen of Italian descent, who

has had gambling interests.in México in the past. He. is the

husband of actress Merle Oberon and reputedly wealthy and politically
influential in Mexico. Although "La Prensa" is considered leftist,
and irresponsible, it's believed appropriate inquiry should be made
-to determine whether Marcello may have interests in Mexico.
