MM 105-2855

; Miami has been in close contact daily with MM 928-PSI,
Cuban exiled pilot who furnished accurate details of attempted
12/28/63 raid by MIRR, During this period PSI has reported the
progress made by BOSCH in planning another raid. It appears
that PSI still has the confidence of BOSCH, who plans to use him
again as pilot on the next raid.

PSI was in direct contact with BOSCH 1/24+25/64, and
received no indication whatsoever that BOSCH planned any air raid.
for 1/25~26/64, BOSCH advised he does plan air raid for some- ~
time between now and 2/23/64. He has indicated that raiding ~
plane will operate from a base in Dade County, Fla. area.

BOSCH told PSI that he is departing Miami 1/27 or 28/64,
for New York area in order collect funds for intended raid.
PSI has also reported that WILLIAM JOHNSON, U. S, citizen who
was involved in preparations for the 12/28/63 attempted raid,
is also involved in preparations for next raid and that CHARLES
BUSH, Broward International Airport charter plane dealer, is
scheduled to make available a plane for this raid.

 

~ : PSI stated 1/27/64, that BOSCH has not yet settled
upon a firm plan, but PSI feels certain BOSCH is depending
‘on PSI for his servicesin executing plan.

Above pertinent facts have been furnished only to
u. S, Customs, Miami, at this point for reasons of protecting
MM 928=-PSI, It appears that BOSCH and JOHNSON are attempting
to uncover any informant in this operation by giving out false
information prior to actual date of operation,

. On 12/29/63, JOHNSON, upon being interviewed concerning
13/28/63 raid attempt, advised that he regarded FIORINI as an
informer for the Government, He also expressed suspicion of PSI,
but appeared to be on fishing expedition re the latter and no
other information has been receival reflecting PSI is regarded -

as an informer,
