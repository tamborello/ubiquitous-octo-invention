engage in criminal activity, and the courts have held that,
especially the Supreme Court in the Newark County Case, that-
the very difficulty of penetrating an ongoing operation, that
an informant himself can engage in criminal activity, but
because there is lacking this criminal intent to violate a

law, we stay away from that. Our regulations fall short of that.

If we have a situation where we felt that an informant

has to become involved in some activity in order to protect

or conceal his use as an informant, we go right to the United -
States Attorney or to the Attorney General to try to make sure
we are not stepping out of bounds insofar as the use of our
informants. a ‘

Senator Tower. But you do use these informants and do
instruct them to spread dissension among certain groups that
they are informing on, do you not?

Mr. Adams. We did when we had the COINTELPRO program$,
which were discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably
one of the best’ examples of a situation where’ the’ law was"
in effect at the time. We heard the term States Rights used
much more then than we hear it today. We saw in the Little
Rock situation the President of the United States, in sending
in the troops, pointing out the necessity to use local law
enforcement. We must have local law enforcement, to use the
troops only as a last resort.

And then you have a situation like this where you do try

to preserve the respective roles in law enforcement. You have
historical problems with the Klan coming along. We had
situations where the FBI and the Federal Government was almost

powerless to act. We-had local law enforcement officers in

some areas participating in Klan violence.

The instances mentioned by Mr. Rowe, every one of those,
he saw them from the lowest level of the informant. He didn't
see what action was taken with that information, as he pointed
out in his testimony. Our files show that this information was
reported to the police departments in every instance. We
also knew that in certain instances the information, upon being
received, was not being acted upon. We also disseminated
simultaneously through letterhead memoranda to the Department

of Justice the problem, and here, here we were, the FBI, ina

| position where we had no authority in the absence of instructio:

from. the Department of Justice, to make an arrest.

Sections 241 and 242 don't cover it because you don't have
evidence of a conspiracy, and it ultimately resulted in
a situation where the Department called in United States
Marshals who do havé authority similar to local law enforcement
officials. ,

So, historically, in those days, we were just as frus~

} trated as anyone else was, and when we got information. from

someone like Mr. Rowe, good information, reliable information,

and it was passed on to those who had the responsibility to

@ . eo . “1904

Mr. Wannall. Well, Mr. Adams can probably best address
the use of informants on criminal matters since he is over
the operational division on that. .

Mr. Adams. You do have somewhat of a difference in the fac
that a criminal informant in a law enforcement function, you
are trying to develop evidence which ‘will be admissible in
court for prosecution, whereas with intelligence, the informant
alone, your purpos se could either be prosecution or it could be
just ‘for purposes of pure intelligence,

The difficulty in both is retaining the confidentiality
of the individual and protecting the individual, and trying to,
through use of the informant, obtain evidence which could be
used independently of the testimony of the informant so that
he can continue operating as a criminal infoxmant.

Senator Tower. Are these informants ever authorized to
function as provocateurs?

Mr. Adams. No, sir, they're not. We have strict regula-
tions against ‘using informants as provocateurs. This gets
into that delicate area of entrapment which has been addressed
by the courts on many occasions and has been concluded by the
courts that providing an individual has a willingness to engage |,
in an activity, the government has the right to provide him the|
opportunity. This does not mean, of course, that mistakes don‘

occur in this area, but we take whatever steps we can to

“senator Tower. What criteria do you use in the selection
of informants?

Mr. wannall. Well, the criteria vary with the neéds. In_
our cases relating to extremist matters, surely in order to get
an informant who can meld into a group which is engaged ina
criminal type activity, you're going to have a different set
of criteria. If you're talking about our internal security
matters, I think we set rather high standards. We do require
that a preliminary inquiry be conducted which would consist
principally of checks of our headquarters indices, our field
office indices, checks with other informants who are operating
in the same area, and in various established sources such as
local police departments.

Following this, if it appears that the person is the type
who has credibility, can be depended upon to be reliable, we
would interview the individual in order to make a determination
as to whether or not he will be willing to assist the FBI
in discharging its responsibilities. in. that. field.

Following that, assuming that the. answer is positive, we
would conduct a rather in depth investigation for. the purpose
of. further attempting to establish credibility and. reliability.

Senator. Tower. .How. does the. Bureau. distinguish between
the. use of informants. for law enforcement as opposed to
intelligence. collection?

Is the guidance different, or is it the same, or what?
