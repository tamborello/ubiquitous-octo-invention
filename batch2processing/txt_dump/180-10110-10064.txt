Mr. James A. Wilderotter
Associate Deputy Attorney General
Department of Justice

10th § Constitution Avenue
Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Wilderotter:

As you know, we have been checking on certain allegations that
the CIA was a conspirator in the assassination of President
Kennedy. We have talked to Agent Shaneyfelt of the FBI and
have received a summary Bureau report on its investigation to-
date. into such allegations. We now request’ certain. additional
assistance from the Bureau as follows: i?

i. We enclose an additional 21 photographs of E, Howard Hunt,
reportedly taken during the period 1957-1966. In addition,
we expect to be able to send to you very shortly additional
photographs of Frank Sturgis, taken in the early 1960's.
We would like to have a thorough examination made to com-
pare these photos of Hunt and Sturgis with the photos which
the Bureau. already has on file and which were taken in
Dallas on November 22, 1963, as certain "derelicts" were
-being accompanied to the Dallas Police Department. —. ,

2. We have learned that E. Howard Hunt is approximately 5 feet -
9 inches tall, and that Frank Sturgis is approximately
5 feet 11 inches tall. We would like to have on-site
measurements and photographs taken at one or more of the
scenes in Dallas shown on the November 22, 1963, photos to
. determine if the persons shown in those photos are persons
of heights similar or dissimilar to Hunt and Sturgis.

be expedited with the greatest possible speed. . Thank you. :
