~ _ FRED PHILLIPS of the Registrar General's Depart-
ment , (commonly called Registry Office), Nassau, Bahamas,
has been known to the reporting Agent for a number of years
and has always been most cooperative.’ He was furnished a
list of the various insurance companies, agencies and firms
described in report of SA WILLIAM F, HOOD, JR., dated
January 31, 1963, at Chicago, in the case entitled "JAMES
_. RIDDLE HOFFA; CHARLES W.: BRAY; ET AL" (Bureau file 63- ~7893),
but found that only the following were. ‘registered: |

British International Insurance Company, Ltde; /
“Tropical Holdings, Ltd.;

Jonsphilips, Ltd. together with Intercontinental
Life and General ‘Insurance Company, Ltd., which
turns out to be a firm operated by JOHN MICHAEL ;
KEARNEY. i

FD 302's are set out concerning the registry of
these four firms.

PHILLIPS stated that: during: July 16-18, 1963,
he had attempted to make discreet inquiries among his
contacts in the pertinent law firms as to the true: |
ownership of these companies but had met no success, :
probably because the-firms are inactive and the files in : |
the law firms would not be accessible to his contacts.
I

, STANLEY R. MOIR, Superintendent, Criminal Investi-
gation Branch, Bahamas Poli ice, upon being asked about '
TAYLOR ALBURY, STEVENSON and MOREE, officers and directors
of Intercontinental Life and General Insurance Company,
Ltd, stated that they were all members of the extreme ~
left wing of the Progressive Liberal Party and that if
interviewed, the next edition of STEVENSON's paper, "The
Herald" would doubtless have a big headline about the FBI |
snooping around the Progressive Liberal Party. For this.
reason, no direct contact with these people is contemplated;
it further being suggested that they are merely figurehead
officers in this firm which actually was run by JOHN MICHAEL
KEARNEY.

Mr. FRED PHILLIPS of the Registrar General's
Department, -Nassau, Bahamas, (commonly known as the
Registry Office), related that there are approximately
6,000 corporations listed in the Registry Office,
probably 75% of these corporations having been founded -
in the last 10 years, because of the growing awareness among
American investors and operators, of the tax advantages
offered by the Bahama Islands. |

Mr. PHILLIPS further stated that approximately
half of these corporations are bona fide visibly operating
firms, whereas the other 3,000 or so do not operate
visibly and many of them do not even file the reports

of annual meetings required by Bahama law.

Mr. PHILLIPS stated that these reports consist
simply of any changes in officers, directors, capitali-
zation, etc. No reports are required as to operations,
finances, or employees or stock transfers.

Mr. PHILLIPS further added that there is a
statutory penalty of five pounds ($14.00) for each day
of delinquency in filing these reports, owever, this ;
penalty is never imposed. Therefore, Mr. PHILLIPS pointed

out, as to these 3,000 or so corporations whose operations

-are not visible, and who do not file their reports, the

‘Registry Office has only a list of incorporators, officers

and directors. Typically, such firms are incorporated by

an attorney whose fees run from 100 guineas (9294 00) to
! $600.00, the latter figure being that charge by STAFFORD oe
| - Ls SANDS, the leading Nassau Attorney. : : .

When such firms are thus founded through an |
attorney's office, the stockholders, officers and directors
will invariably be clerical personnel of the attorney's
office and sometimes the attorney himself. The purpose,
of course, being to obscure the true owners and operators
of the corporation. Mr. PHILLIPS stated that the incorpor-
ating attorney, of course, will not furnish any information
as to the true owners of the corporation, advancing the
attorney - client relationship as his reason.
