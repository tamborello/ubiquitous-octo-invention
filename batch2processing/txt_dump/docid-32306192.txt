points which should have been covered prior to closing
this case, 1 respectfully point out that the information
furnished by MM-639-S in my opinion made coverage of
these points unnecessary.

I regret that the Bureau feels I should have
taken a different approach and broadened the investigative
activity in this matter. In accordance with Bureau request,
I shall take the necessary steps to comply with instructions
as set forth in Bureau Hetter dated August 25, 1961, and
a report fully covering the activities of subject will be

the Departmental letter reflects this opinion was based
on information received by the Department indicating
that subject had been identified as head of the Inter-
national AntiCommunist Brigade and was present with
several of his men at a gathering of some 75 Cubans at
Davie, Florida. The Department also referred to a
newspaper article appearing in the 'Miami Herald" on
July 3, 1961, indicating that approximately 70 men of
subject’ s organization were scheduled to make parachute
jumps but only two parachutes were available. This
article stated subject had claimed his organization

- consisted of 5,000 men, of which' 700 are in training,

and that his organization includes paratroop groups,
underwater demolition teams, and others in educational
activities,

While the Department used the above data as
the basis for requesting additional investigation in this
matter, I felt that the data as furnished by MM-639-S,
a well informed and reliable informant, appearing in the’
Details of referenced report, sufficiently disproved the
exaggerated statements given by subject to the press as
to the strength and activities of his organization, and
that this data would: have been sufficient for the Department
to render a prosecutive opinion. As I have stated previously,
investigation has shown that subject is’ prone to exaggerate,
distorts the truth, is a liar, braggart, among other things.
I have previously interviewed subject concerning his
activities, at which time he was arrogant and evasive,
as reflected in my report dated April 24, 1961. It was
my opinion that to seek the subject out once again and
interview him concerning his activities would be repetitious
and therefore result in a waste of investigative effort.
This opinion L:set forth in the administrative pages of
referenced report. AL)
