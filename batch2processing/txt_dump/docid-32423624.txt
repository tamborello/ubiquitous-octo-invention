et | Trafficante Made Secret Appearance

ys

j By RON LaBRECQUE
Herald Staff Writer
Florida’s reputed organized
crime boss, Santos Trafficante of
Tampa and Miami, made a secret,
’ four-hour October appearance be-
‘ fore the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee to answer questions about
his role in a CIA assassination plot.
investigation sources have dis-
closed. . ° 7
Trafficante, 62, had not previ-
ously been questioned by the com-
i mittee or its staff in the two-year-
old investigation of CIA activities.
Of the three Mafia figures in-
volved in the early 1960s plot to
kill Cuban Premier Fidel Castro,
only Trafficante is still alive. Both
Sam Giancana and John Rosselli
‘were murdered within the last 16
months. .
The murders are unsolved.

INVESTIGATORS ALSO said
that Trafficante had dinner with
Rosselli at The Landings, a Fort
Lauderdale restaurant, in mid-July,
less than two weeks before Rossel-
li disappeared. Rosselli’s body.
stuffed in an oil drum, floated to
the surface of Dumfoundling Bay
the first week of August. .

Trafficante reportedly has told
police that the July dinner with
Rosselli — as well as several other
meetings previously at the Cordoba
Restaurant in Miami. formerly
owned by the husband of Rosselli’s
niece, according to police — were
“friendly, social events with no
business.” , .

Investigators in recent weeks
' . have centered their efforts on trac-
‘ ing the whereabouts of Traffi-
cante’s associates at the time of
Rosselli’s disappearance. a source

said.

could not be reached for comment.
Trafficante was identified as the
head of a South Florida Mafia fam-

‘ily in testimony in 1963 before a

U.S. Senate subcommittee.» +

HIS ATTORNEY, Henry Gonza-
lez of Tampa, ‘who accompanied
Trafficante when he went to
Washington, according to sources,
would not comment on either the
Senate appearance or Trafficante’s
past activities. When first asked
about the Senate appearance, he
said, “You realize you're treading

A committee source said that
rafficante had not been ques-
tioned previously by the committee
because his role in the plot -had
idered “secondary.”
Interest was rené rp!
after Rosselli’s death. Investigators

              
  
     
    

sought to determine whether the
murders of the two men were con-
nected in any way. with their testi-
‘mony or potential testimony before
the committee. . a

boss in Chicago for many years.
was killed.in June 1975. at the
same time Senate investigators
were preparing to contact him. The

gun used to kill Giancana, found .

miles from, Giancana’s house’ a
month. .after the murder. was
traced to a Miami gunshop, but the
trail stopped there.

Investigators said the gun was
part of a shipment purchased in
1965 by the Tamiami Gun Shop.
but there are no records to indicate
where it went from there, accord-
ing to investigators and gunshop
owners. :

Rosselli, whose most powerful
Mafia days were reportedly in the
1950s and early 1960s in Las Vegas
and Los Angeles, did appear before
the committee at least three times
in the 12 months before his death.

In’ Washington, the committee
has. kept a tight clamp on comment
about the investigation, and only
one member, Robert T. Stafford
(R., Vt.), acknowledged the Traffi-
cante session, saying “I was not
present when the witness you
speak of was in front of the com-
mnittee.”

. Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii),
+the committee, chairman who,
along with Sen. Howard Baker (R.,
Tenn.) pressured for Justice De-
partment and FBI involvement in
the Rosselli murder case, said “T
have never met Mr. Trafficante.
That’s as far as I'll go.”

, A PRIME interest of the commit-
tee has been possible links between

Sources Say

the CIA Castro plotting and the as-
sassination of John F. Kennedy.
Revelations of the Senate commit-
tee were a key factor in the cree
ation of the new House of Repre+
‘sentative investigation, which is
‘taking a new look at the JFK mure
der. .

Trafficante reportedly has told
investigators that he first met Roa-
selli about 1956. It was in the early
1950s that Florida law- enforce-
ment officials estimated that a Boe
lita opertion run. by Trafficante and
his brother netted $2 million annu-

ally.

Trafficante was a major gettte
bling figure in pre-Castro Havana,
where he_ran a casino. In 1959, it
was estimated that $1 million or $2
million was bet nightly in all the
Mafia-run casinos in Havana. The
gambling stoppet when. Castro
took over in 1959.

Rosselli was.the first of the
three Mafia figures to be recruited
by the CIA in 1960 in its plot to
sassinate Castro. .

IN A CIA memo quoted in an fine

terim report of the committee a'

year ago, it was said that Traffl-
cante’s role was to “serve as a coue
rier to Cuba and make arranges
ments there.”

Rosselli told his CTA liaison that
“Trafficante believed a certain
leading figure in the Cuban exile
movement might.be able to accom-
plish the assassination.” An intere
nal ‘CIA ‘investigation in 1967 “suge
gests that this Cuban may have
been receiving funds from Traffi-
cante and other racketeers interest-
ed in securing ‘gambling, prostitn-
tion and dope monopolies’ in Cuba
after the overthrow of Castro.”

MEMORANDUM

To: Mike Madigan
From: Ed Greissing
Date: Sept. 16, 1976

Subject: Review of CIA documents presented the SCI by Jack Anderson

 

The documents recently received by this Committee, from Jack
Anderson, had previously been reviewed by the Church Committee staff.
The documents appear to be a few of those requested for FOIA review
by David Belin. It is my understanding, after these documents were
declassified, David Belin furnished copies to both David Martin(AP)
and Jack Anderson. :

The Church Committee was permitted to review the entire Oswald
201 file, the AMLASH file, Garrison files and selected Office of
Security files. The Committee primarily concerned itself with the
early period of the investigation(November 1963 - October 1964), as
it believed the information to be received from this time period
to be more relevant in evaluating the performance of the intelligence
agencies with respect to their investigation. ; .

Dan Niescher, the Church Committee contact at the CIA,was the
individual responsible for the declassification of documents
relating to the assassination of President Kennedy. During this
declassification process, Dan Niescher consulted the Committee staff
to make sure that we were aware of certain documents.In addition,
Mr. Kaleras had given the staff unlimited access to all files we
believed necessary to conduct our investigation.

Yet, the possibility still remains that the staff was not
shown everything. The CIA has maintained throughout that the Oswald
201 file was a complete compilation of the material related to the
assassination of President Kennedy. However, information relating to
who Lee Harvey Oswald was, and what he was doing are not included.in
their files. The Oswald 201 does not attempt to question Oswald's
connection with both pro-CGastro and anti-Castro groups.or any of
the AMLASH information. The most notable subject missing was inform-
ation relating to CIA/U.S. Government attempts to assassinate Fidel
Castro. ‘ ‘ :
