20 Bookmaking Operation

On 1/27/62 AUSA J. HARDIN MARION, III, exhibited
to SA J. STANLEY ROTZ, anonymous letters he had received, in
handwriting which appeared to be from the same individual. One
of these anonymous letters, postmarked 1/20/62 at Baltimore
stated that the mob has brought back JIM RUSSO's (CORONO) body
guard, WALLENSTEIN, to help TROTTA (MAGLIANO) with the collecting.
The letter described WALLENSTEIN as the one charged wi th PERRERAS
for the murder of CASTRANDA three years ago. He was arrested in
Anne Arundel County in a bookmaking raid; $10,000.00 was paid to
keep the case from coming up. (It appears the anonymous writer
had in mind one BENJAMIN (HITTY) WILDSTEIN.)

Another anonymous letter, apparently from this same
source, was referred to this office on 2/7/62 by AUSA MARION, and
it contained the following information:

"JULIUS SALSBURY and ANGELO MUNAFO are partners in
a horse book operation. MUNAFO is bank rolled by his father-in-
law, BENNY TROTTA. This book does approximately $80,000.00 worth
of business a week. This figure is not exaggerated. JOSEPH RIZZO
and JAKE JAFFE do the work behind the phones". The letter
continued, "You will have to use an expert tail. JAFFE used to
own half of the Trocadero Night Club until he was forced out of
business by FRANKIE CARBO. RIZZO served time for gambling in the
early 1950's."

on 3/8/62 Baltimore Confidential Informant 1-56
advised SA FRANCIS C. O'NEIL and SA THOMAS LEACH, Jr. that
since ANGELO MUNAFO married BENNY TROTTA's daughter some years
ago, MUNAFO is actually the man who runs all of the numbers and
pookmaking activity that TROTTA formerly operated. TROTTA, in
this informants opinion is a contact man for the gambling element
and actually is not actively engaged in the numbers -bookmaking
business at this time. Allegedly MUNAFO has told the informant
he is not afraid to speak out on any type of subject concerning
TROTTA and he has actually heard MUNAFO "chew out" BENNY.

On 3/16/62 Baltimore Confidential Informant T-55
advised SA FRANCIS C. O'NEIL that within the past year BENNY TROTTA |
desired to conduct a floating crap game in Anne Arundel County. :

contact man for Chief of Police WILBUR WADE of AA Co. P.D. in
