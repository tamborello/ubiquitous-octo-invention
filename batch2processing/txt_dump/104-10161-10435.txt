MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security
ATTENTION : Alien Affairs Staff

SUBJECT : Vladimir RODRIGUEZ Lahera —- Admission to the U.S.
of Wife and Two Minor Children

1. Subject is a former staff employee of the Cuban Intelligence
Service who defected to the free world in Ottawa, Canada on 21 April
1964, Subject had been planning his defection for some time and
accordingly he brought with him a large amount of classified material
which he delivered to this Agency. As a result of his defection the
Agency was the recipient of extremely valuable information on the
Cuban Intelligence Services both in Cuba and in the Western Hemisphere.
Since April 1964 Subject has continued to be of high value to the
Agency and continues to assist us in every way possible.

2. It has now been learned that Subject's family (Wife and two

_minor children by her first marriage) are expected to depart Cuba
for Mexico on 14 April 1965. In view of the imminent arrival of

. Subject's dependents it is requested that entry be arranged for the
family in as expeditious a manner as possible. While normal entry
can be achieved under section 212(D)(5) of the Immigration and
Nationality act it is felt that due to involvement with the Depart-
ment of State and the requirement of National Agency Checks, the
admission to the U.S, of Subject's family might be delayed.

3. The expeditious, rather than routine, handling of the
visas of Subject's family is of importance for Subject's morale
and because Subject, himself, should spend a minimum of time in
Mexico for security and operational reasons. Further, his proximate
operational use is anticipated and any delays in arranging for entry
of his dependents could result in the delay or cancellation of
planned operational activities.

4. It is, therefore, requested that Alien Affairs Staff
arrange with Immigration and Naturalization Service for the prompt

 

 

 

admission into the U.S. of Subject's family once they arrive in 23
Mexico City. ae
