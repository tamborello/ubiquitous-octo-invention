B. Letter for OLC fr Chief Counsel/Director
of HCSA, dtd 22 Dec 77

 

1. This memorandum is in response to the request
in paragraph 4 of Reference A. CCS files contain
information on five of the 11 individuals identified
in Reference B as follows:

a. Alias Dan Carswell (True Name David L.
Christ) -- Approximately 30 documents, virtually
all of which concern the establishment, maintenance
and use of cover for Subject during his Agency
career as a. Staff Employee from 1956-70.

 

 

 

“b. Louis Posada ~~ CCS maintains a covert tax

(his émployment as—an- Indépendent contractor from *

only in accordance with the provisions of Section
. 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code. In the opinion
“of CCS, the-time frame of these documents would make .-.:
‘them irrelevant to the investigation being conducted
by the HCSA: Staff.

c.  Cesario Diosdado.-- Approximately 25 documents
on Subject, a Bureau of Customs official who assisted
CIA from 1961-68 on a reimbursable basis. Virtually
all of the documents concern arrangements made between
CIA and Customs for the use of Subject. The Commissioner
of Customs should be contacted prior to release of.
information in this file.

 

d. David Attlee Phillips ~-- 125-150 documents,
virtually all of which concern the establishment,
maintenance and use of cover for Subject during his
Agency career as a Staff Employee from 1953-75.

e. Lucien Conein -- 100- 125 documents,
virtually all of which concern the establishment,
maintenance and use of cover for Subject during his:
career with the Agency as a military detailee and
Career Agent from 1954-68.

2. CCS files on the individuals listed in paragraphs
la, c, d and e above contain forms, memoranda and personal.
data concerning administration of cover exclusively. In
the opinion of CCS, identification of specific documents
that could be of.interest to the HCSA cannot be made
until such time as the -HSCA Staff narrows the focus of its
inquiry.

 

 

3. There is no information in “ccs files on “the other
items listed in Reference B.
