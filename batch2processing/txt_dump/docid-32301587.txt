reliable,

. As the Bureau is aware, the activities of Cuban
revolutionary organizations are frequently spontaneous
and unpredictable. They do not follow the set pattern
usually common to other nationality groups a nd to the
Communist Party. A Cuban revolutionary group may be formed
; to carry out only one or two operations, and then cease to
; exist, Consequently, it is necessary for this office to
act with dispatch in placing appropriate coverage on a par-
cicular organization which is planning 2 raid.

these cases should be applied with sufficient flexibility

visk.-__—ds doubts the value of any such raid as planned
by BOSCH. He also has confidence in the FBI and believes
it is his duty to cooperate,

In order cor[_ to acquire this information
he has’ to associate with BOSCH at the expense of neglecting
his personal affairs. He is in the business of repairing —
air conditioners and other electrical equipment. He also
gives private flying lessons. He has gotten behind in some
of his expenses, and faces loss of his telephone service.

i He will be unable to continue close association with BOSCH
at this critical time unless he can be compensated for his
loss of time.

This office, to date, has paid him a total of
$350.00 out of a total $400.00 authorized by the Bureau.
} An additional $50.00 will be paid to him 3/27/64, which will
exhaust the current authorization.

[_Jatreaay has proved his productivity and

reliability. His position with BOSCH is unique because of
his qualifications as a pilot and a veteran of previous raids.
It is because of his background es a man of. action and ad-

as an advantage in assessing him es a PSI,

was also his doctor at the time of his confinement, advises

on 2/11/64 that has recovered from his previous

state of depression, and is leading a normal life, unlikely
to have a recurrence of his previous state of depression.
