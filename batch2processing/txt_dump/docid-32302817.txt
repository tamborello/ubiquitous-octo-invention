LNY 4112-S* has produced ‘information that the subject

SA DANIEL A, FLYNN,dated 5/4/64, at New York). This informant has
also produced evidence that’ the subject may have been in covert
contact with the New China News Agency in London, (Legat, London
letter to Bureau 6/29/64 and NYlet to Bureau 7/30/64.)

“There is strong evidence to indicate that the subject

The ab information indicates that the subject maintains

d
l
! Deontact with the Chinese community in New York through JAMES and

ANN LEE, the Chinese Communist Government through TANG Ming-chou
and the New China News Agency and the PLM. This gives rise to the
possibility that she may be the "Chinese paymaster.'

If the subject is the "Chinese paymaster" these funds
could come to her fremChina through Chinese seamen or Chinese
traveling from Hong Kong to the U. S. who would transfer these
funds to the LEES and thence to the subject.

Since the regent establishment of offices of the
New China News A@ency tin Canada and Mexico, these funds could
come tothe subjecttthrough these agéncies of the Chinese Government.
It is to be noted that NY 4047-S* has recently advised that the

a contact of TANG Ming-chou, is currently in Mexico City..
(Bufile 100-8436)

It is also to be noted that PLM has an organization
in Canada and PLM members from New York travel to Canada where
they may secure funds from either the New China News Agency
directly or from PLM in Canada.

NY 694-S* advised SA A. C. BURLINSON on 2/11/65 that he does
not know what information GUS HALL has to back up his statement that
the subject is the "Chinese paymaster." NY 694-S* stated that it
is his opinion that since HALL knows that the subject has been in
China and is now working day and night for the Chinese cause, she
must be a Chinese agent. NY 694-S* advised that HALL is inclined
to "talk off the top of his head."

A review of the subject's banking activities since September
1963 has not revealed any unexplained - financial transactions. “All
deposits and withdrawals are in line with her income.

Concernig the statement attributed to PHILIPBART that the
pro-Chinese group in New York has four permanent employees and an
‘enormous sum of money at its disposal, it is pointed out that the
group in New York which adheres strictly to ‘the.Chinese Communist

These four individuals are the subjects of Bureau
investigations.

/ | These four individuals are in frequent contact with
the subject and her husband, RICHARD C, ANK, ay: - Evg.

Concerning the financing of the PLM, PHILIP LUCE y
j| advised ROMERSTEIN that he believes the funds for PLM come from
i China but he does not know how. ,

ei NY 4661-S reaémtty went to Canada on PLM business.
a \ While there he met ABE )MAINHEIM, who works as a translator for the

| Hsinhua News Agency, as well as two Chinésé nationals’ employed —~
° | at “the néws"apereys” MAINHEIM spent several years in China and

~."| is plannirg to return to China. /

NY 4661-S had several discussions with these people
about the various PLM publications. During one of the discussions
it was brought out that PLM is apparently getting outside funds to
pay their staff, operate a press shop and print their publications.
It was brought out that PLM might be getting money from Peking,
to which MAINHEIM replied, "They probably are." MAINHEIM Pndicated
the Communist Chinese would be willing to subsidize an organization
similar to PLM. : :

A review of the PLM file indicates that this organization,
’ although relatively new, does not seem to have financial difficulties.

The Bureau of Special Services, New York City Police

in-racial rioting in NYC, has advised that PLM seems to be well
financed. BSS advised that the PLM seems to go from a period of
letting bills pile up to a point where they pay all their bills
and_have plenty of money. : :

Vn the summer of 1964 the NYC PD arrested WILLIAM L.
VEPTON, a PLM.leader, on charges of criminal anarchy. EPTON had

five $100.00 bills in his possession at the time. The serial
numbers of the bills EPTON had were in the same sequence as the
pills discévered on a Chinese Intelligence Agent previously arrested

in South Korea, who was carrying $200,000.00 in American

currency and $1,000,000.00 in Koréan currency. The closeness

of the serialization (56 numbers apart in one instance) would tend
to indicate EPTON'S money was part of the same shipment as the
money in the possession of the Chinese agent, but, of course, it
would not be possible to prove the money was all a part d one
shipment.

During the race riots in the summer of 1964. another
PLM inember was being questioned by a grand jury about reports that
he had been carrying $5000.00 on His person, He said he had no
recollection of this, but did say that he had received some money
recently from the Settlement of an estate,

In the latter part of 1964, mrablevone, JACO pv) ME
and LEVI B were discovered late at night -by police in Wes tcheSter
County in the act of burying two attache gases wrapped in plastic.
They had a rented car and two brand new shovels. JEROME told police
the attache cases contained old family records and it was his
mother's wish that they be buried on this estate. Police checked
with JACO MAN, owner of the estate, who said they had his ;
permission to bury the records; RODMAN was a CP member in the '
1940's and has been employed as:a correspondent in Moscow for a
British newspaper. He and his wife were uncooperative witnesses
when they appeared before the HCUA. The police did not open’
the attache cases. ROSEN and the others said they would return
the next day, during the daylight hours to complete their task,

_-but they did not.

Both PHILIP LUCE and NY 4661-S have stated that

publications of PLM are sent to. China and the Chinese send money

to PLM in payment for these publications. Information has been
received that such a transaction was handled through the Two

,

‘Continents Commodity Corp. (Chicago letter to Bureau dated

3/25/64 captioned "Communist Party, USA - Factionalism; IS - C")
This may be a source of the money coming from Peking to PLM.

Recently WILLIAM L. EPTON told an individual that if
he wished to make a tax-free donation to PLM the individual should
donate the money to the Louis M. Rabinowitz Foundation (Bufile
97-4878) and this foundation in turn would give the money to PHM.
