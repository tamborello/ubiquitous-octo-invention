MEX 105-3702 i

 

who acquired this intelligence information, I feel a
responsibility for seeing it through to its final evaluation."

It appears, therefore, that Mr. THOMAS has now decided that he

and not the FBI or the Department of Justice is the one to

decide how the story given by Miss GARRO is to be evaluated.

The concept that every person who passes on to another govern-

ment agency information relating to matters within the jurisdiction
of that agency has the responsibility and authority to review

and evaluate the action taken by that agency is, of course,
untenable.

 

J. Further question concerning Mr. THOMAS! judgment is

raiseafoy item 3 of paragraph 10 of his memoran: d
, the Secretary of State. Any reference to the >)
/ vrelationship between the head of CIA Mexico a top Méxican

/ officials,if true, is a very highly classified matter and any
"leak" or revelation to unauthorized individuals concerning such
an arrangement would, in view of the delicate Mexican political
situation, be disastrous to the Mexican Government as well as
to Mexican-American relations. The delicacy of the situation

' has recently been greatly augmented by the published Cuban

/ allegation that one of the officers of the Mexican Embassy in

 

 

Havana wag acting as a CIA spy with the knowledge of the Mexican
Governmen Sir THOMAS, however, included such a highly
classified reference in a memorandum which he classified only

as "confidential", contrary to regulations relative to classification |
of documents. While this reference relates to the activities and
, operations of another Government agency and therefore is not of
primary concern to the Bureau, it is nevertheless called to the
\ Bureau's attention for,consideration in evaluating Mr. THOMAS’
\current allegations. (&)
AN

An additionél copy of this letter is being forwarded
for,use in the event the Bureau desires to forward a copy to
Dallas which received a copy of referenced letter.
