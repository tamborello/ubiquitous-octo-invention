' Re report of SA John B. Hotis. dated 4-9-65,

On page 2 of re report information is set forth, .
attributed to DL 135-C, to the effect that John Dragna, a member
of the Board of Directors of the Merchants State Bank, Dallas
is Civello's contact with the Merchants State Bank as weil as
‘the contact for other local racketeers. This informant also
reported that when the records of that institution were recently
checked by your office; Dragna immediately notified Civello and
several other racket figures who seamerdy had accounts in that
bank.

It would appear from the above action on the part of .--
Dragna that his position with the bank is being utilized to tHe
advantage of the hoddlum element. Also from Dragna's action;
there would appear to be some degree of influence exerted on-
a bank official by the hoodlum element.

   
  
 

In conductingzyour criminal intelligence investigs
of Civello, this situation should be more fully explored t
determine the extent of Dragna's relationship with the hoodlum
element and the~degree of hoodlum influence being exerted on
i him ‘and the reasons therefor. Inquiries should also be made.
to determine whether Dragna is related to Louis Dragna,
* Les Angeles hoodlum. You should also be alert to the possibility
of Dragna, in his capacity as a bank official being involved :
in a violation of the banking laws.

Upon obtaining more detailed information regarding this
matter, a comprehensive letterhead memorandum should be submitted
to the Bureau in accordance with previous Bureau instructions
relating to Hoodlum Influence in Banking Institutions.

In view of the information received to date, you should
be circumspect in your dealings with the: Merehants State. a; a) 7
