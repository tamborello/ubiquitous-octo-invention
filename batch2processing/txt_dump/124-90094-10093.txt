ARAGON stated that he was not entirely optimistic
about the future of Cuba. ARAGON said that the Cuban people
cannot be entirely unified as there are so many politically
ambitious leaders among the exiles and there are many jealousies
and there tts much criticism leveled against the Revolutionary ;
Council and the United States Government because of the
unsuccessful invasion of April, 1961. ARAGON advised that the '
pehieved that the Cuban Government was. weakened day by day,
that the underground would eventually overthrow CASTRO, together ;
with the economic hardships which the Cuban Government is
suffering, but without a strong unifiedopposition and 100
per cent cooperation from the United States, he saw a very
unhappy picture for Cuba in years to come.

ARAGON said that MIRO CARDONA went to PRIO's residence in
Miami and asked for PRIO's support and anything that PRIO could
do that could enhance the position of the Revolutionary Council.
ARAGON advised that at this meeting PRIO promised his support,
but also asked Dr. MIRO to put several of his, PRIO's, men on
the payroll of the Revolutionary Council. ARAGON stated that Dr.
MIRO told him that the Council did not handle the money, as this
was at that time handled directly by the FRD, ARAGON stated
that Dr. MIRO and CARLOS PRIO-have met several times since
and on each occasion Dr. PRIO has. informed Dr. MIRO that he is
in support of Dr. MIRO but then’ PRIO goes on and makes propaganda
which definitely is against Dr. MIRO and in his, PRIO's, favor.
ARAGON advised that as a result of recent statements made by

Dr. PRIO, Dr. MIRO CARDONA no longer has any desire to speak
with CARLOS PRIO. . :

NY 2865-S advised that in early September, 1961,
he was with GUILLERMO ALONSO PUJOL in New York, and PUJOL
showed him a confidential letter on the stationery of the U.S.
House of Representatives written by VICTOR L. ANFUSO to Secretary
of State DEAN RUSK. NY 2865-S stated he was not sure of the
date of this letter but believed it was 8/27 or 28/61. In this
letter to DEAN RUSK, Representative ANFUSO asked RUSK to
recognize a Cuban government in exile and offer it all the
necessary assistance in order to overthrow the present Cuban
Government. ANFUSO also, in his letter to RUSK, stated that.
Dr. GARLOS PRIO had supported Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA as
Provisional President in the event such a government in exile
was recognized by the United States CX U

: From information available thusfar, there does not
appear to be any definite plans on the part of CARLOS PRIO to .
set up a government in- exile in a Latin country. The Cuban
exiles are divided about PRIO and the majority of them greatly

| question his ability to unify a majority of Cubans.

(4) INVASION EFFORTS

There has been no information received from Cuban
exiles in the Metropolitan New York area indicating any serious
plans to mount an invasion from the US to Cuba. There are also
no reports of any invasion being planned by individuals in the
