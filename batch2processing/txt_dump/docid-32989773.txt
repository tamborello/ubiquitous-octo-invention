MUIRKIN INVESTIGATION (ASSASSINATION OF KING).

AT A MEETING WITH HSCA OFFICIALS ON AUGUST 16, 1977,
CHIEF COUNSEL ROBERT G. BLAKEY AGREED THAT, TO AVOID DUPLICATION,
1 WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR HIS STAFF TO REVIEW ONLY THE
FIRST PAGE OF ANY FIELD OFFICE DOCUMENT WHICH WAS DIRECTED

 

TO OR RECEIVED FROM FBI HEADQUARTERS OR THE MEMPHIS FIELD
OFFICE (FBIHQ FILES HAVE BEEN PROCESSED AND MEMPHIS FILES

ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROCESSED FOR THE HSCA). THIS FIRST PAGE
WILL PROVIDE THE HSCA A CHRONOLOGICAL ACCOUNTING OF ALL
SERIALS IN THE FILE. ALL SERIALS NOT DIRECTED TO OR

RECEIVED FROM FBIHQ OR MEMPHIS WOULD HAVE TO BE REVIEWED In
THEIR ENTIRETY.

THE HSCA ALSO DESIRES TO SEE ALL NOTATIONS IN THESE
FILES UNLESS THE NOTATIONS ARE FOR INDEXING PURPOSES OR
GRAMMATICAL CORRECTIONS. THEREFORE, IF A FIELD NOTATION
APPEARS IN OTHER THAN THE FIRST PAGE OF A SERIAL THAT
EXISTS IN THE FBIHQ OR MEMPHIS FILE, COPIES OF THAT PAGE
WILL HAVE TO BE REPRODUCED AND FORWARDED TO FBIHQ.

EACH RECIPIENT, EXCEPT MIAMI, USING THE ABOVE CRITERIA,
FURNISH FBIH@ TWO XEROX COPIES OF YOUR MURKIN INVESTIGATIVE FILE.

conduct independent ballistics tests
next week on the bullet that killed
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

An FBI expert testified in pro-

too badly damaged to determine if -
it came from the rifte that Mem-:
