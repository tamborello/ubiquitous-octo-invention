THE CRIMINAL “COYMISSION,” EBT AL. ,
AR - CONSPIRACY .

a 10/29/62 NK 2251-C¥ advised - in a conversation
pertaining tothe organized criminal group known as “La Causa
Eostra” - that Chertes “Lucky” Luelano had allegedly “made®
Meyer (Lansky), Frank (Costello,) and Joey A. (Adonis).
informant was unable, however, to provide amy additional details
coneerning this remark. oe

On 11/30/62 CG 6486-C* reported that Chicago hocdlum
Tony Accardo had made the remark, “i see they made the Jew
an Avugad,” but was unable to provide any clarifying data.

From the above remarks it would appear that Meyer
Lensky is possibly a member of the captioned -“Commission.”

The New York Office should immediately interview
RY 3461-C-%E, NY 3586-C-TE, and Joseph Valachi (your file
92-1459) to ascertain whether they have any information indicating
that Lansky or any other non-Italian is, or ewer has been, a
member of La Causa Nostra and/or the criminal “Commission.” WG

In addiction, the New York Office should obtain
identifying details from Valachi regarding Thomas Gagliano, who
was reportedly a New York gang boss from 1930 until his death
in- approximately 1953, including any corroborating data in
possession of the New York Office. Valachi abieges that Gagliano
was Thomas Luchese's predecessor, whereas NY 3454-C-TE reports
that Joe Adonis was (see reports of SA John &. Kinsinger dated
5/28/62 and 11/16/62 re “Thomas Luchese, aka, AR").
