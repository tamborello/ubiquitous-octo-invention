Sgt. LARRY MEGGS, MCSO, Key West, Fla., advised they were
then conducting a narcotics investigation in Key West
involving ARTIE CRESPO, Attorney MANUEL "MANNY" JAMES,

_ ISMAEL GARCIA, and others.

. The Miami Div. advised that the name "ARTIE"
listed after telephone number of PATRICIA CLARKE, is
apparently in reference to ARTEMIO CRESPO, aka "ARTIE,"
who has Long been the bolita banker in the greater Key West,
Fla. area. Previous investigations conducted by Miami
have identified CLARKE as being CRESPO'S mistress, which
association she has maintained for approximately 3 years.
GRESPO is. known to use CLARKE'S residence, 404 Balido,
Stock Island (adjacent to Key West), and her telephone
for purposes of conducting his gambling and narcotics
operations. A former Miami source, MM 2778-PCI, who was
acquaimted with CLARKE, advised that CLARKE, herself, was
not an active participant in CRESPO'S operations, and was a
largely ignorant about the extent and nature of his activities.

 

_'*.GRESPO'S personal residence at 1404 Patricia St.,
Key West, Fla., was raided by Agents of the Florida Department
of Law Enforcement (FDLE), on 5-15-72, and mumerous items of
gambling paraphernalia were confiscated at that time. The
raid followed 3 months of extensive surveillance activity
by the FDLE: Although the results of that raid were
initially furnished to the Miami Strike Force (MSF) for
proposed. action, the case was returned to Monroe County, Fla.
for local prosecution on 2-6-73, Pursuant to this, CRESPO
was artested by FDLE and MCSO personnel on 2-13-73, charged
with violation of State of Florida Lottery Laws, and Conspiracy
to Violate Fla. Lottery Laws. He was indicted by a Monroe Co.
Grand Jury,and is presently free on bond pending trial on
these charges. : °

   

; On 3-15-73, MM 2786=PCL, who has furnished reliable
information in the past concerning gambling and narcotics
activities in Key West, Fla., advised he was unaware of any
gambling or organized crime links between CAGNINA and ARTEMIO
CRESPO; although in his opinion, this was entirely possible
in view of their individual involvement in criminal operations.
