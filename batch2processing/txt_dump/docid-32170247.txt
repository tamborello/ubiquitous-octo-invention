Relative to the interviews of Mr. and Mrs. RICHARD V. LE CLAIR
set out in details of report, a lead was set out for Dallas

in Milwaukee tel to Bureau and Dallas dated 12/3/63 to identify
the funeral home employee and investigate circumstances.

Relative to the interview of MARGARET BUDREAU as set out in

by teletype dated 12/4/63 and Dallas was given additional
detailed information by airtel the same date and was requested -
to consider the information in the light of facts known
concerning subject's whereabouts in July, 1963.

Concerning the interviews of NORMAN FREDERIKSEN and his wife,
ELKE FREDERIKSEN as requested by reference Dallas teletype

to Milwaukee 12/3/63, the results of which are set out in
FD-302's in this report, it may be noted that NORMAN FREDERIKSEN
said that he couldn't recall VOLKMAR SCHMIDT as being present

at the EVERETT GLOVER party in February, 1963 at which OSWALD
spoke. NORMAN FREDERIKSEN also stated that he became suspicious
of OSWALD principally because he managed to get his Russian~
born wife out of Russia and-he also recalls that a friend of

his said that OSWALD, upon his return from Russia to the

United States, wouldn't take a job unless it was in a photo-
graphic lab. When asked the source of this he said he felt

this friend might possibly have been ILYA MAMANDOR, an employee
of the Socony Company of Dallas, who apparently is Russian born
but now a citizen of the United States. He further stated

that ILYA MAMANDOR wouldn't have come to the GLOVER party

if he had been invited because ILYA wouldn't go to any place
