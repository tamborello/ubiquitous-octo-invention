material or information, but that it does not release me from my
obligation to protect the security of cryptographic information, the

‘knowledge of which I might still retain. I shall continue to protect --

that information to the best of my ability, and I shall likewise pro-

_tect.the cryptographic information of other .U..5 Government ‘agencies

should I have knowledge of that. information. u

 

3. ; r have read the ‘provisions of Public Law” 513 of 3B May ‘1950.
I understand that I am bound by that Act even after the revocation of
my cryptographic clearance and my termination from CIA, and that im-

proper disclosure of cryptographic information could subject me to pun-
ishment under the provisions of the Act.

4. I certify that no CIA staff cryptographic material remains in
