with Freedon of Information Act law suits brought against the
Agency concerning the files on Lee Harvey Oswald, stated that he
believed that Ms. Duran may have been a source of information for

either the CIA or the Mexicans. 771/ - 367

Mr. Hidalgo, professing not to remember all the details, stated
that he thought that Duran was a Cuban intelligence agent.) 368

With no corroborating evidence for Mr. Hidalgo's memory, the
Committee must conclude that Silvia Duran was probably never
employed by Cuban Intelligence. 369

*_ U.S. Interference

 

The Committee believes that there is a possibility that a
U.S. Government agency requested the Mexican government to refrain
from aiding the Committee with this aspect of. its work. 395

 

Oswald's Spanish

The reporter described Oswald as a strange and introverted

individual who spoke very jittle Spanish. 1030/

that the missing production from the pulse camera and the LILYRIC
