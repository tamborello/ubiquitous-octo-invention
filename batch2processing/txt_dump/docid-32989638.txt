Recommend entire cocument be classified "Seeret,"
xGDS 1, 2, 3.

Portions recommended for excision from attachad have
been uncerlinéd in red or bracketed in rea im Left maczin.

 

Generally, cciteria for exelsion were:

1. Information vhich could identify sources or
sensitive techniques .

2. “ames of individuals or organizations vhose
privacy cequires protection

3. Information which vould reveal our overall suecess
oc lack of success in a given investigative area

4. Information from "thicd Azencies" or fricnaly
Focoirn agencies

5. Identities of Bureau personnel belor the Section
Chier level

 

The adequacy of Personnel Sections, in general,
disclose the extent of our commitment in specific areas of
countarintellijcnee activity. ‘Ve have given the Committees
uninistrative Division figures regarding total manpover
involved in security investigations but, to my Imovleuge, ve
have not given them a breakdo-n as to «here these personnel
ace assigned. aA policy decision is necessary as to vhether +e
vent to pinpoint, through release of “Adequacy of Personnel"
sections of these inspection ceports, precisely how much oc
ho liccle manpovrer va have on specific types of investigations,

It is questionable whether the information regarding
eciminal cases in the San Francisco ceport is germane to the
Committee's inquiry. It would not seem improper to me to
delete all references to criminal matters and mecely substitute
a page saying that "pages to relate to eriminal
investigations."
