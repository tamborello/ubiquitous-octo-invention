dormant contact with his last RIS contact in Copenhagen, and to re-
port the outcome of his visit to the Soviet consular officials. :

  

KANTOR stated that he had been in the USSR twice, both times..o
a visitor's visa issued to him for stays with his uncle in Minsk. He was:
on the first trip from end of May till middle of July, 1958. His first
visa was issued for one month and he renewed it for an additional period
of two weeks at the Minsk OVIR. He returned via Moscow by plane

 

was in Minsk all the time.

His second trip to the USSR lasted from 2 June 1959 to 8 Septem~
ber 1959, Except for the days, 6 and 7 September, which KANTOR spent
in Moscow obtaining valid Polish and East German transit visas, he
stayed in Minsk all the time, about 3 months.

   

KANTOR visited his parents in New York from November 1958
to January 1959. In the summer of 1960, he traveled with his mother,
by car, from LeHarve to Berlin when she went to the USSR to visit he
brother.

  

 

KANTOR related that he was befriended by Boris Fedorovich
KHRYACHKOV, a Soviet diplomatic official in Copenhagen in 1957 and
1958. In Minsk, KANTOR was contacted on several occasions by a.man
from a “Ministry, Viktor Ivanovich SAZONOV, who, on their second
or third meeting, offered KANTOR 500 rubles to buy a gift for KANTOR's
aunt. KANTOR refused this money. SAZONOV urged KANTOR to take
an active part in the "peace struggle" and to "cooperate" but made no
specific proposals or suggestions, KANTOR claimed that he was listen-.
ing to SAZONOV and nodding moreor less his assent to the idea that peace
is better than war, that atomic weapons should not be used, etc., etc.
KANTOR admitted that SAZONOV could well have concluded, on the basis
of their conversations, that KANTOR was more or less a sympathizer.
KANTOR stated that he guessed what SAZONOV was after, but since
KANTOR did not give out any information and agreed with SAZONOV's
general idea only passively, KANTOR did not think that their meetings
were of great significance. KANTOR also stated that one request by

SAZONOV was outright foolish; namely, that KANTOR could help the cen pee

“peaceful forces" by signaling to them a threat of war from the West
(early warning!). The term intelligence was never mentioned during
KANTOR's stay in Minsk and he left in July without having accepted
any instructions or assignments from SAZONOV.

KANTOR further related that he met KHRYACHKOV again at
the Embassy in September 1958 and stated he wanted to return to
Minsk for the whole summer of 1959 because he had enjoyed his stay
very much. KHRYACHKOV promised to help him get a visa, After
KANTOR's return from a visit to his family in the United States, he
again went to the Embassy and contacted KHRYACHKOV regarding
his visa. In February 1959, KHRYACHKOV initiated the beginning
of an obviously clandestine meeting system away from the Embassy
and KHRYACHKOV's home. From February to May 1959 they met

‘several times on street corners and cheap eating places. KANTOR was

requested to tell whatever he knew about friends and student acquaintances
in Copenhagen, the specific requirements for admission at the university,
the organization ''Clarte'’ and other information not bearing upon KAN-
TOR's visa application. KANTOR reluctantly admitted that he submitted
four or five written "statements" in his own handwriting to KHRYACHKOV
during this period. KANTOR also admitted supplying the following names
of American students who were in Copenhagen at that time: Murry
BROWN; David BRIAR; Peter LENNEHAN; Raymond KEA, a Negro...
student; and Don COMERFORD, KHRYACHKOV evidenced interest in

an:

and Rembert Craven ALLEY, an American architéct.

When KANTOR visited Minsk for the second time, in June.1959,
he was approached by Yevgeniy KAHN who said he had been in the United
States, implied he had been in New York and Washington, D.C., and
asked about KANTOR's background and the purpose of his visit. He also
asked that KANTOR meet him on the next day at the Hotel Byelorussia,
purportedly in connection with KANTOR's request for an extension of
his visa and sojourn permit in Minsk. KAHN appeared to KANTOR to be
more authoritative then SAZONOV,

The next day, KAHN told KANTOR that if he wanted to stay a
longer time with his relatives in Minsk, the Soviet authorities had to
be certain about his good intentions and good faith and that full infor-
mation was needed on his personal background, his family, his military
service, his friends, etc. KAHN asked KANTOR a lot of questions and
again talked at great length about peace and the war ‘threats from the
West and about how every "decent" and "honest" person should actively
participate in the peace fight. He offered KANTOR money and travel to
other places in the USSR, which KANTOR allegedly refused. Then
KAHN gave KANTOR an address to contact KAHN at in Moscow should
he desire to contact KAHN.

against KANTOR in the form of a receipt for money
paid to him and they could claim it was given by KGB.

"Source was advised that KANTOR reportedly de-
livered gifts to SHARIF at the request of a Soviet con-
tact in Copenhagen, Boris KHRYACHKOV, who was
assigned to the Soviet Embassy. Source commented
that FCD, recognizing that KANTOR could possibly be
recruited, arranged for SCDto select an agent (SHARIF)
to whom KANTOR could be sent to facilitate his assess-
ment and recruitment. In the event the recruitment
was successful, the SCD would inform FCD which in
turn would inform the Residentura in Copenhagen,"

CIA Operational Debriefing of KANTOR, April - May 1961:

Under pretext of an inquiry connected with a survey of American

scholars and graduate students engaged in Slavic studies in Scandinavian
universities, KANTOR was interviewed by a CIA officer on 11 and 12
April 1961,

Although KANTOR was first interviewed under selected academic

cover, as the discussion reached the point of his contacts with Soviet
citizens and officials in USSR in 1958 and 1959, he was informed of
American Intelligence interest. KANTOR was interviewed in depth from
1500 to 2030 and then at dinner in a restaurant until 2330. The next day
KANTOR ascertained the interviewer's bona-fides without divulging in-
telligence connection and met again at 1500 as directed. The second de-
briefing lasted 4 hours.

KANTOR provided information that he had been in the USSR

twice, in 1958 and 1959, for protracted visits with his uncle in Minsk;
that he had been in contact with Soviet Embassy officials and RIS repre-
sentatives, both in Copenhagen and Minsk, since fall 1957 until February.
1961; that he had been subject to a RIS recruitment attempt in Minsk in
summer 1959, which he allegedly refused; and that he still planned to
visit his relatives in Minsk, in May or June, before returning to the
United States in September.

KANTOR was instructed by American Intelligence to proceed

with his application for a Soviet visa, make no effort to revive his semi-

own initiative. KANTOR was given 500 rubles and
signed a receipt which the KGB intended to use for
blackmail purposes at a later date. (KGB would in-
dicate that the money was given by the KGB rather
than by a newspaper correspondent. ) :

"In addition, for blackmail purposes, KGB was
planning to place Vladimir Arsentyevich GRUSHA in
contact with KANTOR, GRUSHA was a KGB officer

oe who had been expelled from the United States as per-
sona non grata. KGB planned to photograph him with
KANTOR and use the photograph to support a conten-
tion that KANTOR was in contact with the KGB.
Source did not know if this plan was actually carried
out.

 

 

"Source believed that IVANOV had contact with
KANTOR and was involved in the recruitment of
KANTOR, but, of course, was not alone in the ap-
proach,

 

"Source stated that the Seventh Department did
not have any information from the First Chief
Directorate (FCD) regarding KANTOR but began
study of him on its own initiative.

"When advised of the Soviet refusal of a visa
for KANTOR in 1961, Source stated this may have
been done on the instructions of KGB to avoid attract-
ing American Intelligence Service (AIS) attention to
KANTOR. Another trip to the USSR might appear
suspicious to AIS," ‘

On 31 January 1969, NORMAN provided information to repre-
sentatives of the FBI which has been reported as follows:

"On January 31, 1969, the Source, in response
to questions, stated that he knew GRUSHA was to be
used in one of the cases handled by IVANOV but he
was not sure that this was the KANTOR case and he
might have been mistaken when he reported this on
January 27, 1969. He stated KGB "had a good thing"

Self 'given in First Chief Directory.' That's why he could make mis--

 

At this point, the case of Melvin KANTOR was referred to and
NORMAN was asked if he was reading that as Melvin KANTOR, NOR-
MAN was told there was a case on an individual by the name of Marvin
KANTOR. NORMAN stated, “If he is the same, 30... was born in
'37, and was a student in Harvard, was studying, it's possible he...
because, you know there wasn't file and there isn't place where he can
check. NORMAN affirmed that there wasn't a file to look at to get the
information on KANTOR, He stated, He (NOSKOV) has written him-

 

 

take."

NORMAN was asked if he thought the recruitment of "KARP"
was made by Vladimir IVANOV. NORMAN replied that it was possibly °~
IVANOV but NORMAN did not know. NORMAN denied, however, that
it could possibly have been Yevgeniy NOSKOV who recruited "KARP"
because NOSKOV could then have written something definite without
mistakes. NOSKOV wrote too little on this case. This made NORMAN
think that NOSKOV was. not directly involved in the "KARP" recruitment.

 

  

During an interview of NORMAN, on 27 and 31 January 1969,
concerning Melvin KANTOR, NORMAN was advised information had

 

.been received that KANTOR brought a bottle of wiskey and some other

articles to a Soviet correspondent in Moscow named SHARIF at the re-
quest of an official of the Soviet Embassy, Copenhagen, Denmark, where

_KANTOR was a university student; and, at SHARIF's request, KANTOR wrote

an article for which SHARIF paid him and KANTOR was required to give
SHARIF a receipt for the money. NORMAN identified SHARIF as an agent
of Vladimir IVANOV of the Seventh Department, SCD, KGB, and source
expressed the opinion, “It was combination of IVANOV and Seventh De-
partment that KANTOR had come to write a short article of his impres-
sions of Minsk - (and SHARIF) had given him 5,000 rubles - it was
KGB's combination" because SHARIF "cannot do this i> .any corres-
pondent cannot do this thing - and SHARIF was an agent." NORMAN
indicated that the money given by SHARIF to KANTOR undoubtedly was
KGB money, and it was the KGB which insisted that SHARIF obtain a re-
ceipt from KANTOR,

Among handwritten comments NORMAN furnished while review-
ing photographs and names of numerous Soviets who had been in the
United States, are the following comments concerning Dzhavad Azizovich
SHARIF:

Seer

October 2, 1969: "SHARIF, D.A. - an agent of
7th Department, SCD, KGB; in 1959 there were a
number of signals (indications) that he was studied
by American Intelligence for recruitment. SCD,
KGB was planning to make an operative game on this
basis."

 

. November 7, 1969: "SHARIF, D,A. - a corres-
LO pondent; an agent of the 7th Department, SCD, KGB;
ee in 1959 SCD, KGB was hoping that he would be re-
cruited by CIA,"

 

Among handwritten comments NORMAN furnished concerning KGB
agents about whom he had some knowledge, without the benefit of photo
graphs or specific names to refresh his recollection, is the following:

“SHABAD - a correspondent, an agent of the 7th
Department, 2nd Chief Directory; in 1959 were signals
that the American Intelligence studied him - at the end
of 1959 he was in the USA with KHRUSHCHEV's group -
SHABAD was instructed if (there) would be approachment
to transfer a conversation in Moscow - but there was
not made an approachment to him in the USA in 1959."

 

NORMAN subsequently indicated he confused the name of Theodore
SHABAD, an American correspondent, with Soviet correspondent, SHARIF.

On 27 January 1969, NORMAN furnished information to repre-
sentatives of the FBI which has been reported as follows:

™(NORMAN) recalled that KANTOR was recruited
by the KGB in the USSR in 1959. He was recruited by
representatives of the 7th Department, Second Chief
Directorate while traveling as a tourist in the USSR.
(NORMAN) recalled that Vladimir Vladimirovich
IVANOV, a KGB officer, was operating an agent who
was a correspondent named Dzhavad Azizovich
SHARIF, This correspondent was placed in contact _ vee ete
with KANTOR and, on behalf of KGB, induced KAN-
TOR to write his impressions of Minsk. (NORMAN)
stated that SHARIF would not have done this on his

STATUS REPORT

Synopsis:

NORMAN reported that Melvin KANTOR, born 1937, whose
cryptonym is "KARP," and who was a student at Harvard University
and who had distant relatives in the Soviet Union, was, in 1961, re-
ported by Eugene NOSKOV as having been recruited on ideological

 

grounds, Vladimir Vladimirovich IVANOV handled this case which

was turned over to the First Chief Directorate. NORMAN admitted
that NOSKOV could have been mistaken on the date as NOSKOV did
not have first hand knowledge of the matter.

Marvin KANTOR, a professor at Northwestern University, |
born 9 May 1934 at New York City, New York, was a student at the
University of Copenhagen from 1957 - 1961. He visited his uncle
in Minsk, USSR in 1958 and 1959 and admitted to a CLA officer in
1961 extensive contacts and cooperation with Soviet officials in ° ,
Copenhagen, Denmark and in Minsk, USSR. He also recounted a clear
recruitment attempt by one Evegeniy KAN in Minsk in 1959 which he
allegedly refused. Yet he continued contacts with Soviets in Copen-
hagen through April 1961. He has made additional visits to the Soviet
Union in 1965, 1969 and 1970. He has repeatedly denied any contacts
in the United States, or abroad, by Soviet Intelligence since 1961.

Ph. D, and was employed as a lecturer in Slavic languages. He was
still affiliated with the University of Michigan when he accompanied the
tour group of students to the Soviet Union in 1965. In June 1966, after

Information From NORMAN:

NORMAN was given three pages of his notes, on 28 November
1967, and was requested to translate the notes and give an explanation
of how he obtained the information. NORMAN furnished the following

_ in response to this request:

“The recruitments of the lst Section, 7th Depart-
ment, 2nd Chief Directory in 1960-1962, reported to
me by a senior case officer of the lst Section, NOSKOV,
Evgeni, who, during the absence of the chief of the Ist
Section, DERA, temporarily acted as Chief of Section...

“ 4'Karp' - KANTOR Melvin, born in 1937,.a
citizen of the USA, student at Harvard University, has
far relatives in Russia, recruited on a loyal basis.
Against him worked a senior case officer (later chief
of Section), IVANOV, Vladimir. The file was given to
the lst Chief Directory."

On 9 May 1968, the FBI furnished a translation of available notes
of NORMAN. A report on "Recruitment of Foreigners by the personnel
of the lst Section" contained the following:

"1961 - 6 'Karl' - Melvin CANTOR, born 1937,
Harvard University student; has distant relatives in the
USSR. Recruited on loyalty basis (case) transferred to
PGU,"

 

On 27 July 1968, NORMAN was requested to consider carefully
several cases on NORMAN's list of “recruitments of the First Section
of the Seventh Department in 1960-1962 reported by NOSKOV." NOR-
MAN was asked if there could be any cases on this list which were in
1959. NORMAN replied that there could be 1959 cases included; that
NOSKOV could be mistaken; that the list was not important as to when
the recruitment took place. For NORMAN, who was preparing the re-
port for BOBKOV, it was merely who were recruited (agents) during
the entire period. NOSKOV could have made some mistakes because
he was asking officers in the absence of the Chief of Section. Some of
these officers perhaps did not remember or just knew a little bit, such
as a file being given to the First Chief Directory. It was concluded pos-
sible, therefore, that there could be a 1959 case in this list.
