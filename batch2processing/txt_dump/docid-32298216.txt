1961). (He stated that sevéral days before the contact, —

FRANK LENTINE, Youngstowi burglar, had mentioned to him a
possible “house score" where a considerable amount of cash’
belonging to the late DE NIRO was supposed to have been kept,
LENTINE stated that the residence involved is the present’
residence of the ‘parénts of DE NIRO. and where his brother,
LOUIS DE’ NIRO, resides. According to’ LENTINE, when DE NIRO

- was ‘alive hé always had a, barber come to his home. One occasion,

according to this barber, he was at ‘DE NIRO's home and after
giving hima ‘hair cut, DENIRO did not‘have. any cash on‘him. —

This barber stated he usually was paid $10 or $20 for each visit. -

On this particular..occasion, DE NIRO, after. noticing he had no
eash, then pressed a button which. opened a door leading to the.
attic. DE NIRO went into.the attic and came down and gave the
barber a $10 bill. ‘LENTINE's belief was that the attic 1s the
location of. DE NIRO's money. a oe :

fo -Regarding. VINCENT-.J, DE-NIRO, .cV T-60 stated that ©
according to LENTINE,’ prior to DE NIRO's-.death, DE NIRO.had been

(LOUIS LE. PORES), who was employed by the NAPLES brothers as...
_a@ repairman in the operation of the United Music Company, had
seontacted him to buy some electronic parts. TORMA appeared
- “aécompanied by an ind&vidual whom he described as short, ;
wearing a hat and glasses, and who it would appear was iprobably .
PAUL HOLOVATICH who is associated with the NAPLES. brothers in
the Center Sandwich Shep operation. | He stated he inauired of
. TORMA as to how business. was going, and TORMA replied - hey
were being bothered by the local police and the. 'federals." vee
At this point, the individual believed to. be HOLOVATICH reminded =~ ©
TORMA of the time he stopped the "federals" with his car.  - :

CV T-51, advised that in 1957, PAUL CLAUTTI of Younga-. —
town and CAVALLARO were partners ina trucking company for. about
three or four months.. CAVALIARO put up most of the money. and. .<
they had three or four dump trucks. which they used to haul gravel .
from Pennsylvania to. Liberty Township, Ohio,. north of Youngstown,
where a sewer line was being installed. CV T-51 stated that.
because of the inexperienced truck drivers whem. they employed, |
one of. whom wrecked the truck, the. business. was. not successful

and. folded. : ;

It was. pointed out to CV T-51 of the FBI's intense
interest. in solving the CAVALLARO bombing. He stated he was.
very interested in determining who was responsible for. the killing: ..
and added he believed ANGELINE CONSTANT © had considerable. infor-..-
mation regarding MOIO's. activities. He stated he did not.know. ~~

with the rackets for many years. He stated that SHUTRUMP has
done time in the Federal Penitentiary at Milan, Michigan, on
an income tax evasion. conviction. :

; CV T-49 advised on July 22, 1964, he had visited
FRANK MEZZATESTA, Kent, Ohio, that evening; and while there, |
MEZZATESTA's nephew, ANTHONY MADAFFARE, appeared at the house, ;
riding a motor scooter. CV, T-49 stated the conversation again - . wo
got around to Youngstown and both MADAFFARE and MEZZATESTA ~ oy
eautioned him to stay away from Youngstown. . MADAFFARE stated
that over in Italy when a man has a friend, he can trust him,
but stated that in Youngstown "friend kills friend." . .

cv T-49 stated he learned that MADAFFARE was probably
closer to DOMINICK MOIO than was MEZZATESTA, He stated from ;
their conversation; he gathered that MOIO and MADAFFARE had ,
lived together and, although they did not say specifically,
_ he gathered it had been in Youngstown. He stated he got the
‘definite impression that MADAFFARE had more definite infor-
mation about MOIO's activities than did MEZZATESTA.

_ @v T-49 advised that MEZZATESTA in talking about the
bombing of BILLY NAPLES on July 1, 1962, stated that. MOIO had
been responsible and that "they" had ordered him to do this.
He stated he, himself, lized BILLY NAPLES, but when sucha
thing was ordered, he was powerless to interfere. MEZZATESTA

also stated that MOIO made the mistake of working for too many
factions and he would work for any group for money, and that
was what finally caused his death when it was determined that
he had "hit". some member of the "organization."

cv T-49 stated neither MEZZATESTA nor MADAFFARE men-
tioned who MOIO had "hit" from the “organization," but he
assumed they meant either CAVALLARO or VINCENT J. DE NIRO, who ;
was killed July 17, 1961, while MOIO was in the employ of ee |
BILLY NAPLES. ;

cV T-24 advised on July 24, 1964, that when the barbut —
game. operated in Youngstown on South Avenue, and possibly in .
Struthers, Ohio, JERRY CONTI had a piece of the game; however, , |
he was later cut out, apparently when CHARLES CAVALLARO shared — ;
and was definitely out of the game when it operated in. Campbell,

Ohio. : .

going to say. CV T-51 stated he has not visited CONSTANTINO at

her home because her two daughters might get. the wrong impression .

and tell others about: his visit. CV T-51 agreed that CONSTANTINO
' would undoubtedly have much information. about the activities of”
MOLO.and his relations with BILEY and JOEY NAPLES.

CV T-51 pointed out that as he had previously repent.

‘GONSTANTINO had told him that she believed the NAPLES brothers.
were responsible for MOIO's death and she had warned MOIO prior

the NAPLES.

- GV T-51 also stated that only a short time after MOIO.
- met CONSTANTINO, MOIO was working behind the bar. He stated:

a request that he, CV T-51, borrow. $5,000 from MOIO and. that
KELLY and he would then start. their own business. He recalled...
