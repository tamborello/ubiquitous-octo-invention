MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY
FROM:

SUBJECT: Comment on TDCS- 3/492, 958.

Whatever instructions President Diem issued it is-evident that
the military and civil officials concerned with the war spared us no
details in emphasizing (or over-emphasizing) the seriousness of the
situation.

With specific reference to the highland area of Central Viet-
Nam, not only was the Taylor Mission informed of the situation, but
Mr. Joseph Alsop as well. The problem there is that the officer
commanding has at his disposal perhaps 7,000 troops to protect the
Kontum- Pleifu area; and these troops are stretched thin in support
of the civil guard on passive protective missions. He lacks a sub- —
stantial reserve force in case the infiltrators of recent months into
that area should form up and attempt to seize and hold one or both
of the provincial capitals in the plateau.

_ It was partly to provide directly and indirectly against that
contingency, among others, that the Taylor Mission urged that some
U.S. forces be on hand in Viet-Nam,

As we pointed out in our report, there is no reliable estimate
of the scale of forces now in the forests above the plateau which might
be assembled for a strike. When briefed by General Don, the Corps
Commander in the area, we were given an estimate as high as 16, 000
for the scale of VC forces on both sides of the Laos border opposite
the plateau. The commander on the spot gave Dez Fitzgerald (and
Alsop) a more conservative estimate of 4-5,000. If that force could
be assembled, however, it might make grave difficulties if it- should
strike, given the lack of a local reserve and the time required to
move up a reserve force from elsewhere.

Beyond this specific area, it was the judgment of our mission
that the "regime had lost control of the security situation" only in
the sense that its existing forces were stretched so thin that it lacked
the mobile reserve (as well as the intelligence, command structure
and mobility) to go on to the offensive. The mission concurred in the
view that it would be wise to introducé some friendly foreign forces in
order to raise the "morale of the VNA and encourage the population at
large." ;
