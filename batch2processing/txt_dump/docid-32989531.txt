“Atlanta Constitution" fon 11~15-62 based on a study called "“Aibany,
A Study of Racial Responsibility." The study was written by
Dr, Howard Zinn, who has been the subject of a security investigation
by this Bureau (100-360217), Zinn was reportedly a member of the
Communist Party from 1949 through 1953 and attended Communist Party
meetings during that period, The study by Zinn criticizes the FBI,
.the Federal Government, and the administration of the City of Albany,
Georgia,

Georgia, and the study was published by the Southern Regional Council,.

Zinn is a history professor at Spelman College in Atlanta, ‘
| a group formed to advance equal opportunity for all the South's pecplo,

  

‘The full context of the article is attached,

The article in one section states:
ea

~ .. “Albany Negroes, said Zinn, who is white, tend
to distrust local members of the FBI. The
Spelman historian urges the creation of a
special corps of Agents to investigate civil f. 4
a rights cases, fo

‘“twith all the clear violations by local police

. of Constitutional rights,' said Zinn, ' the FBI
has not made a single arrest on behalf of Negro
citizens,’

(2 0 ~ 369.219 ~

The Atlanta Office completely covered the activities at Albany, @ |
Georgia, and detailed memoranda were submitted to the Department daily. i

Memorandum to Mr, Belmont
RE: RACIAL SITUATION
ALBANY, GEORGIA

The report appears to be a slanted and biased document
similar to a previous report written by Zinn on Albany. Again
Zinn does not add anything to the clarification of the racial
. Problem in the South,

ACTION

Zinn should not be dignified by contact by this Bureau,
and it is recommended that no action be taken in connection with
him, .

January 3, 1962, and a copy cf it as previously been furnished
