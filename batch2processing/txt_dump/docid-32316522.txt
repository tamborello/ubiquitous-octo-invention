Re: James Riddle Hoffa

On November 8, 1961, a confidential source
-who is employed by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters (IBT) in the New York area, advised that a
, vift" has developed between James Hoffa and John
AQ'Rourke International Vice-President of the Teamsters -
Presidént of Teamsters Joint Council 16, New York.
This Bource advised that O'Roukke enjoys an extremely
favorable reputation with HarryAVan Arsdale, President,
New York State American Federatiyn of Labor-Congress of
Prausteial _Organizationg (AFL-CIO); and will not raid the
=CIO locals in the New York area as requested by Hoffa.

This source stated that if Hoffa insists on

raiding George Meany's locals in New York, O'Rourke will

break with Hoffa and the source anticipates that Joint

Council 16 will be split down the middle on this issue.

had been told by O'Rourke that “the rift between James

Hoffa and some of the IBT vice-presidents is widening.

about Hqdffa and it,appears that the “Irish” (including

The source stated at that time that it appeared
the ruling faction of the ‘Teamsters was split and would

"choose sides".

On January 4, 1962, this source was recontacted
on this matter. He stated that there is a definite
coolness existing between Hoffa and O'Rourke, O'Brien and
Flynn, but he advised that as he has studied this situation
it becomes apparent that the vice-presidents will not take
any. drastic action to cause a split within the Teamsters
ranks. He said that O'Rourke complained to him how, at
