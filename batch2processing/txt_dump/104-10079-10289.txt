of the Partido Commista Mexicano and visiting communist leaders.
Much of this coverage, 25 rolls of 35mm film, was in support of

. planned recruitment attempts and the LIENTRAP"take" was of considerable
value in providing identifications, locations, and contacts of various
targets. LIENTRAP "take" provided the positive identification and
location of the subject of HMMA-25183, dated 18 Jamary 1965, and thus
enabled a visiting case officer to make the recruitment attempt of

this individual.

‘L, SECURITY AND PROBLEMS.

a) During the period under review, there have been no known incidents
which adversely effected the security of Project LIEMPTY. However, as a pre-
cautionary measure, the LIENTRAP photographic unit was repainted (a basic color
change) in January 1965. It is believed that this action will increase the
security of the LIENTRAP unit and allow it to again operate in various areas
where it had been used extensively in the past.

b) There have been no major operational, personnel, or administrative
problems in this Project during the re sporting period. : :

5. PLANS.

a) During the past project year, many of the operational assignments,
leviedon Oliver G.-SCANTLING, while within the realm of the Station's RMD,
have fallen outside the scope of Project LIEMPTY. Consequently, a new Project
Outline is being prepared at the Station to cover the relationship with, and
the present and anticipated operational activities of SCANTLING..

b) Anticipated changes in the LIMITED installation/activities were out-
lined in paragraph 2, Section c above. Other than noted above, there are no
basic operational.or administrative changes contemplated for Project LIEMPTY,

Raymond H. GEREND’ - Throughout this period » Raymond H, GERENDE
continued as the Station's full-time cutout to the LIMITED,
LICALLA, and LILYRIC baschouses as well as maintaining the cutout
responsibility to the LIGViNAP mobile photo unit and the LIEMPTY
photographic~processing basehousc. GERENDE again made numerous
ani essential contributions to the sensitive AMROD operation as
well as servicing numerous postal accommodation addresses.

 

 

Oliver G. SCANTL ~ SCANTLING during the reference period,
continued to make his regulary contribution to Station activities
as the alternate contact of LICASA-1 in this sensitive LAURICLE
operation. In addition, SCANTLING provided detailed casing reports
on the Indonesian Embassy and the home of AMRIFT-1; performed pre-

 

key LIMERICK staffer; and successfully ‘recruited the subject of
MEXI-2315 (dated 19 January 1965) which enebled the Station to
achieve a major technical penetration of the PBRUMEN Embassy in
Mexico City (see also MEXI-2235 dated. 20 January 1965, for
additional details), SCAITLING's.. wtremely professional performance
in this recruitment and the subsequent ticklish agent-handling of |
the subject is to be comnended.

 

 
 

LIMTTED

1) As noted in paragraph 2, Section b of Reference, the LIMITED
photographic, surveillance, and radio dispatching activities were
suspended in late September 196). due to the release of LIMITED
photographs in the Warren Commission's overt report, jhe Station
subsequently acquired an apartment in the immediate veeinity of

the LIMERICK installation and moved the LIMITED basehouse keepers,
LIEMPTY=6 arid LIEMPTY-7 » into this temporary location. All LIMITED
operational activities were then re-initiated from the new basehouse
in early January 1965 and. during that month LIMETED produced 18 rolls
of 35 mm operational film, provided regular physical surveillance
reports, and served as the fined radio dispatch base for one
LIEMBRACE surveillance operation, :

2) During the interim period end as a result of separate correspondenc
with Headquarters, the former LIMITED basehouse and property was sold
to LIMOSINE, who as per formal agreement with the Station, demolished
the old structure and will begin construction of a nev edifice in the
dimmediete future. Incluied in this formal agreement with LIMOSINE is
the proviso that one floor of the new building will be red
the Station's use. Upon completion of the nev Structure,
personnel and operational activity willbe transferred from the
tsmporary apartment basehouse to the new, more ideally located:
LIMOSIMG building. :

 

    
      
   

   

LILYRIC - Throughout the period under review, the LILYRIC installation
continued to provide bhotozvaphie and fixed visual surveillance of the
front of the LIMERICK installation. LILYRIC provided 63 rolls of
operational photograpiis during this perlod which were of definite
value to the Stations KUDSSK operations against the LIMERICK tarzet.
LILYRIC made specific contribitions to the Station's LIOYSTER-1
operation, as noted in MEXI=173 of 4 November 1964,

LICALLA - During the period under review, the LICALLA installation
provided coverage of the back of the LIMERICK installation, .the
garden, and petio area where many of the personnel congregate. LICALLA
provided 60 rolls of 35mm still photographs as well as 600 fest of
