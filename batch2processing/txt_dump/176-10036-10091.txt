6. THE FACT THAT A HAMLET MAY BE OFFICIALLY LISTED AS COMPLETED,

DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE HAS
BEEN ELECTED. ONE SOURCE ESTIMATED THAT 2,000 OUT OF ABOUT
3,000 STRATEGIC HAMLETS OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED AS COMPLETED, HAD
HELD SUCH ELECTIONS, BUT ELECTIONS IN ALL HAMLETS WERE HOPED FOR
BY APRIL 1963. HOWEVER, DO CAO MINH, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE

 

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, ESTIMATED THAT ELECTIONS IN ANY FORM HAD BEEN
HELD IN ONLY 600 AND NOT MORE THAN 700 OF ABOUT 1800 STRATEGIC ”
HAMLETS IN WHIGH AT LEAST PERIMETER DEFENSES AND BASIC ORGANIZA~
TIONAL WORK HAD BEEN COMPLETED.

7. INITIAL HAMLET LEADERSHIP USUALLY IS. “ESTABLISHED BY THE
APPOINTMENT OF A TEMPORARY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE BY THE DISTRICT
CHIEF. ONCE THE HAMLET 1S IN RUNNING ORDER, THE FIRST ELECTION
MAY BE HELD. CANDIDATES ARE ALLOWED A WEEK. TO ENTER THEIR NAMES
ON THE SLATE ‘AND A WEEK TO CAMPAIGN FOR OFFICE. MEANWHILE,
PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATE THE CANDIDATES
TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY MAY BE VG SYMPATHIZERS OR MEMBERS.
“ALTHOUGH THIS PROCEDURE COULD BE UTILIZED TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME
OF AN ELECTION, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT, “OUT OF 50 HAMLET. SLATES
“EXAMINED BY THE AUTHORITIES IN PHU YEN PROVINCE, “ONLY ONE CANDIDATE

WAS ACTUALLY REMOVED AS UNDESIRABLE; WHILE IN TAY NINH PROVINCE

DOCUMENT, BELIEVED AUTHENTIC, APPROVED BY ALL GVN LEVELS IN APRIL
1962 AND REQUIRING ONLY THE SIGNATURE OF PRESIDENT DIEM FOR
PROMULGATION, IT STATED THAT, IF.THE DISTRICT CHIEF WERE SUFFICIENTLY
"PRUDENT, ! THE INHABITANTS WOULD ELECT THE PERSONS SELECTED ‘BY HIM,
ADDING THAT. A DISTRICT CHIEF MIGHT ALSO USE HIS RIGHT OF VETO BY
REFUSING TO APPROVE THE WINNER AND SUBSEQUENTLY CALLING ANOTHER
ELECTION: ALTHOUGH THE DOCUMENT CALLED FOR STRICTLY DEMOCRATIC

STATED THAT THE INTERMINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC HAMLETS
HAD AGREED THAT SELF-GOVERNMENT IN THE HAMLETS WAS ONLY THE
FIRST STEP IN A PROGRAM OF BASIC DEMOCRACY, WHICH WOULD BE APPLIED
PROGRESSIVELY UPWARD TO ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. HAMLET ELECTIONS
WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THOSE FOR VILLAGE CHIEFS, DISTRICT CHIEFS,

5. THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF A STRATEGIC HAMLET IS REFLECTED

"IN ITS COMMUNAL CHARTER OR CONSTITUTION. -A TYPICAL CHARTER
STIPULATES THAT ALL HAMLET RESIDENTS MUST FIRST BE ORGANIZED INTO
GROUPS ACCORDING TO AGE AND SEX, RESIDENTS ARE ALSO TO BE ORGANIZED
INTO INTERDEPENDENT FAMILY GROUPS, AND AN ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE

“WILL BE ELECTED THROUGH SECRET AND DIRECT VOTE. IN SOME HAMLETS

THE TERM OF SERVICE 1S 12 MONTHS. IN. OTHERS THE TERM IS INDEFINITE.

THIS COMMITTEE 1S CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DIRECTING THE

IS ALSO ASSISTED BY AN ADVISORY GROUP CALLED THE HAMLET COUNCIL,
