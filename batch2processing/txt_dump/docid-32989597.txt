While it would appear unds sirable for this office to pay

a portion of the expenses bé borne by the Bureau because of
the counterintelligence value of the organization. if the
“Bureau approves, certain expenses incurred by -in

In addition to the above, the following
counterintelligence measure is being considered:

id has been instrumental in holding a series of
“meetings attended by certain elected stkte officers of
UKA and Titans. These meetings were held prior to the
National Klonvocation, which was -held on 9/2-3/67 at

meetings, their purpose and the names of those who were
present. The purpose of the meetings was to. discuss
ways and means of removing JONES as Grand Dragon and
bringing about changes in the administration of UKA . in

affiliate with him in an honest Klan organization known
as the Confederate Knights of ‘the Ku Klux Klan.

   

The Charlotte Division believes that the mailing
of the above letter would be most appropriate and timely
since it includes attacks on theUKXA and can be delivered
to the Kian delegates who will be attending the National
Klonvocation of the United Klans during September 2 and 3;
i 1967, The purpose of this Klonvocation (convention) is

‘for the:election of Imperial Klan officers. Some of the

“set out in our informant's letter. If this does o¢cur, it.

BACKGROUND: fo % B\

We have been conducting a hard-hitting aggressive
counterintelligence program against the UKA in the State of
North Carolina. This particular group was chosen-as the

- focal point of our attack because North “Carolina has the
- dargest concentration of klansmen in the United States. It ... |
. is believed that if a death-dealing blow can be dealt to pe
- the UKA in North Carolina, the entire Klan oo | in
the United States will collapse. :
