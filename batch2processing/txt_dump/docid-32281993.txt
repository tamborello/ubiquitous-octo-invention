TESTIMONY. OF THOMAS A. PARROTT
Mr. Schwarz. Would you state your name and address for

the record,; please?

 

Mr. Parrott. Thomas A. Parrott ,€351

 

‘Washington, D.C,

Mr. Schwarz. Now Mr. Parrott, when did you first become

jiassociated with the CIA?

Mr. Parrott. In 1949, September of 1949.

Mr. Schwarz. And briefly, what was your career at the
Agency until you assumed a position in connection with the
so-called Special Group?

Mr. Parrott. Well, I started out in the Office of Policy
Coordination, which was a euphemism for, I guess, the Dirty
Tricks Department. My first job was as a Deputy to Colonel
Thomas Betts, who was in charge of planning. I did that for
about a year or so and then I became the Chief of the Operations
Staff of OPC. I moved from that to Deputy Director of the
Soviet Division at a time when as soon as they had merged with
OPC and the action arm at OSO, the secret intelligence arm,
they put these together in 1952 and I was the Deputy Chief of

J
the Soviet Division at that time. I did that for two and a half
years. I moved to Frankfurt as the Chief of Frankfurt base.
I came back from there in 1957 and was assigned as the so-called
Board Assistant to Allen Dulles for the Operations Coordinating

Board.

discussed or attempted, as a matter of principle no official
records were kept of planning, of approvals or of implementation
The few written records that do exist are either largely
tangential to the main events or were put on paper from
memory years after.

‘William Harvey has retained skeletal notes of his
activities during the years in question and they are our best
source of dates, “:: Dr. Edward Gunn of the Office of Medical

Services has a record of whom he met and when, and cryptic

forth."

Mr. Parrott. This all has to do with assassination.

Senator Baker. Yes.

Mr. Parrott. And your question is --

Senator Baker. Do you have any information that would
confirm or dispute that appraisal, that the efforts, the
planning and the implementation of efforts to assassinate
Castro were not committed to paper, and because of the extreme
sensitivity of operations, and it was a matter of principle
that no official records were kept?

Mr. Parrott. I have no direct knowledge. I assume that
probably is true. All I can say again is the records that
I was responsible for did not include this but not because

they were too sensitive but because it wasn't said.

a that is, the FBI needs guidance in its handling of Cuban exile groups

The Group agreed that the best way.to attack this problem would
be to have Mr. Yeagley attend next week's Special Group mecting an
