a former CIA agent, had acquired Soviet citizenship and was
' writing an expose of CIA in the Moscow publication “Literary

Gazette.” Since that date installments ef his expose have

appeared in "Literary Gazette” and interviews (purportedly)

of Smith by Soviet breadcasters have been primarily beamed

to India where Smith was assigned to the U. 5. Embassy,

New Delhi, 1954~59,
