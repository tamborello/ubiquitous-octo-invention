The K. R. P. believes that Gutierres and his group are sincerely
suti-Cestro and assioted ix ite escape from Ciba. .

3. hetated that the defection of these important people
is a blow to Castro because they can become important loaders in
the Escembray. They intead to go back to Cubs to fight actively.

foo Le If they are actually Coummists, the M. BR. P. belfeves that
' thie can be discovered in time, but 1t fears that their being held .
by U. 8. euthorities may well Giacourage other similar defections and,
more seriously, could play into Castro's hands a8 -@ propaganda device
+ to point out to people who escape to the U. 8. . The
M. R. P. told that the u, 8. should handle the matter discreetly ~
to make some-aniouncenent that the elghteea are being held “for their
: own safety” or geome such, which would prevent Castro from obtaining
ot ; @ psychological advantage.
5. The sbove information was passed to Mr. Reena, the 00/C Duty
Officer, on 23 January 1961.
