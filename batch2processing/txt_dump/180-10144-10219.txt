BIOGRAPHIC DATA AND CHRONOLOGY. 5

CRYPTONYM: fAMCLATTER- 1)
PSEUDONYM: /Spencer 0. Terteting )

PERSONALITY TRAITS: / Howard Hunt praised Barker in his
book, Give Us This Day, for his eagerness, efficiency
and complete dedication. "Overall his help was invaluable."
The individual #ho first recruited Barker in Havana
lauded his enthyisiasm and his "“puppy-dog loyalty” to his
case officers, but found he was inclined to indiscretion
because of a ¢ Horales) tc pro-Americanism. Another CIA

=_ “Ea “ak

officer,(David Morales) told Chris Hopkins in a 1972 tele-
phone conversation that Barker was a "Loudmouth" who
Morales}recommended terminating in 1962. (torates was
concerned that as a result of Barker's Watergate involve-
ment, he would "tell the authorities everything he knows."
Indeed, Barker tended to broadcast his affiliation with
the CIA to the members of the Cuban exile community. and:.:
anyone else who might have been interested. This was
tolerable prior to the Bay of Pigs when his assignment

as liaison between the FRD and the CIA was.overt. However,
post Bay of Pigs CIA activities in the Miami area . -
required a more covert approach. Barker was': tn

told to strengthen his cover as prize fight manager and
use "cut-outs" in his attempts to gather information

about the activities of the exile groups. Gradually,

he was to cease all direct contact with the exiles. For

a man who had a "lovevof’ the game", and an even greater
affinity for the,more overt techniques of investigation
and interview, it became increasingly difficult to find

a niche in Miami CIA activities. By the time he was
terminated from CIA employemnt in 1966, he had been
involved less and less with gathering information on

Cuban exile activities, and had spent the greater part

of his time debriefing recent refugees::from Cuba. .

He’ never seemed to adapt to the more covert requirements
of his job nor was he ever able to establish the collective
exile community perception that he was no longer affiliated
with the Agency.
