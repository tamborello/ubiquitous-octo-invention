At 1:00 AM on 5/2/63 CG 6498-PC advised. that he '
was at that time with Alderman FIORATO in the Gaslight Club
_in Chicago and that they had just #eturned from a private L
meeting with State's Attorney DAN*WARD, PCI advised that ~Su..
‘FIORITO had learned from WARD at the investigation which
was commenced by WARD approximately one month ago was now
complete and that there would be no further investigation
or prosecution of FIORITO. WARD advised FIORITO, however,
that he could speak for no other agency and that he indicated to
FIORITO that FIORITO could expect investigations by other law ;
enforcement agencies and legislative bodies for the next four
years in the event he continued to hold office. PCI advised that
for this reason FIORITO continued in hig intention to resign
as Alderman of the First rd. PCI algo advised that and , 7.
FIORITO would contact PAPAMARCY, JO D'ARCO, and TON TISCL (“==
late on the morning of 3/2/63 and make known FIORITO's intention
to resign within the next two or: three days.

 
   
 

 

 

CG 6576-C* advised that during the early afternoon
of 5/2/63 PCI and FIORITO appeared in the offices of the First
Ward Regular Democratic Organization but that PCI was not
present in the immediate office when FIORITO discussed with
TISCI and MARCY the facts of his resignation. This source :
advised that MARCY and TISCI listened patiently for approximately
half an hour while FIORITO outlined his personal reasons for.
not desiring to continue as Alderman of the First Ward. At the
conclusion of FIORITO's presentation MARCY then asked FIORITO :
whether he would be interested in running again for election 4
as Alderman of the First Ward next year after all requirements
-of residence are properly and legally met. It appeared to the
source that this was the first-time that FIORITO was questioned
by MARCY and TISCI concerning this possibility and that it was .
the first consideration he had given to this possibility. When of
FIORITO indicated to MARCY that he would give consideration to !
it, MARCY told him that that would not be good enough, that they
wanted to know right now what FIORITO would do. FIORITO advised
‘that he would like to think about it but MARCY pressed for an
immediate answer. Finally, FIORITO advised MARCY and TISCI
that they could count on him for being a candidate for Alderman
of the First Ward if they could get a commitment from Mayor DALEY
on 5/3/63 that there would be no election to fill the vacancy
which would then exist in the First Ward following the resignation
of FIORITO until February of 1964. In this regard attention is
drawn to the fact that in February of 1964 in the event that
FIORITO continues to reside in the City of Chicago he will be

Chicago to run for Alderman of the First Ward. It is noted

the late evening of 5/2/63 from South Bend, Indiana, to

‘ time to inform the Mayor that he interids at that time
