manifests maintained at Tijuana, B.C., Mexico, failed. to
locate any record of TRAFFICANTE and his wife leaving
Tijuana for Mexico City on 4/11 or 12/68, however the
records are not maintained in good order and therefore
this search would not be conclusive.

desire to include results of investigation conducted by
an auxiliary office which were not available at time of
