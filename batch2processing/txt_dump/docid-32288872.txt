SUBJECT: SAMUEL M. GIANCANA, aka

Review of information available in the Chicago files
indicates that the situation between SAM GIANCANA and PHYLLIS
MC GUIRE is at a point where MC GUIRE might readily discuss
her past relationship with GIANCANA with Bureau agents.(/))

 

From information received from PCI and
peril __———CC—C*ds it’ is evident that MC GUIRE for the
last several months, heeded the request of her sisters to
discontinue seeing grancana.(U3 :

A highly confidential source in the Chicago Division
advised that. during the week of 12/1/63, GIANCANA, during a
telephonic conversation with PHYLLIS MC GUIRE, was highly
berated and insulted by MC GUIRE on that occasion. This
source has furnished other information recently to the effect
that this phone call was not an isolated incident and in Ana tp Ye
MC GUIRE, has on several recent occasions, told off GIANCANA . py

  
 

Bureau permission is requested to have Agents of ‘the / :
New York Division, familiar with GIANCANA's activities, interview }
MC GUIRE to determine her degree of cooperativeness in learning
of activities of which she is aware concerning GIANCANA//)
