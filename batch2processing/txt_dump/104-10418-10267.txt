a. Kennedy waco murdered because he favored a
detente detrimental to the interesta of the "military-
industrial complex”.

(by Kennedy wao the victim of a CIA plot. CIA
° has made common cause with the military-industrial
establishment because of a vested laterest in maintaining
the cold war.

ec. CIA is committed 8 the land war in Asia.

a European audience, Garrison said that the growing
influence of CIA on U.S. media had mads ig impossible for
him to be heard in his owm country.

‘poiftctensly « exedible to elictt rather favorable reviews from penerally

well informed Dutch zewspapers. "Several Dutch viewera alzo
commented on the credibility fot? his persoa and presentation.
Likely that the NES will try te sell this program te other European
stations. .
