MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director
FROM: Thomas A. Twetten

Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Declassification of JFK
Assassination Documents

REFERENCE: Memorandum from Executive Director, dated
13 April 1993, Same Subject (ER 93~2248)

1. Your referenced memorandum has asked that the
Directorate of Operations take steps to speed up the process of
reviewing JFK records.

2. I had earlier been made aware of the slow pace of the DO
review (the ratio of HRG to DO officers was 10 to 1) and
I have taken action to alleviate the resulting backlog. on
12 April, the DO work force reviewing these materials was
increased to the full time equivalent of four persons. Barring
any unforseen difficulties, we anticipate that our increased
effort will eliminate the 57,000 page backlog before the end of
June. The DO officers currently involved in this review can then
turn their collective attention to the additional 135,000 pages
to be completed by 22 August 1993. '

3. I am hopeful that the extra resources will turn the
tide. With this in mind, this Directorate will reexamine the
progress of the workforce by mid-May and decide on the
feasibility of additional help. Because I have detailed these
officers to this project from the FOIA effort, you also need to
be aware that my FOIA response capability has been severely
strained. A decrease in FOIA case output is inevitable,
resulting in one Congressionally mandated effort being in
competition with another.

4. I believe that the efforts to Protect DO sources and
methods have been entirely justified thus far, particularly our
determination to protect liaison involvement, covert employees!
names, sources' identities and locations of stations worldwide.
I understand considerable concessions have been made already
which depart from the DO's normal withholding criteria, such as
the release of many officers' names and the contents of
intelligence and operational reporting.

5. While the JFK procedures do not set a precedent for
current and future FOIA cases, I expect the treatment given to
JFK documents will inevitably affect the criteria used in other
release projects/investigations in the future. We cannot afford
to be imprudent about protecting DO sources and methods in this
or any future circumstance.

6. The DO coordination officers have been reminded of their
responsiblity to be responsive to the letter and the spirit of
the JFK Act. They are fully prepared to meet the standard of
demonstrating damage to the national security should any

withholding be challenged.
