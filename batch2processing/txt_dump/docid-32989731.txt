e

The buyer said he wanted the gun to keep around his house,
Mr. SPAIN described the buyer as a white male, ahout forty
to. forty-five years of age, 5'8" or 5'9" tall, 170 to 175
pounds, dark hair slightly graying at the temples, with a
local (Alabama) accent. The man was wearing a sport shirt
and slacks, colors unrecalled, and he did not have glasses.

Mr. SPAIN was shown five different photographs
of JAMES EARL RAY, and he chose one which had been taken in
California during January or February, 1968, as “resembling
the man" who bought the revolver; however, Mr. SPAIN would
not make a definite identification of the photograph of RAY
as the buyer,

Mr. SPAIN recalled he was contacted by FBI Agents
on April 7, 1968, and shown an artist's conception of an
individual the FBI was attempting to locate. At that time,
hé advised Agents the drawing reminded him of someone he may
have Seen previously, but was unable to furnish any other
identifying information, After viewing the photographs of
JAMES EARL RAY and being questioned about the sale of the
revolver, SPAIN said he was now able to connect the sale
of the revolver with the drawing in that the person depicted
in the drawing reminded SPAIN of the person to whom he had
sold the revolver. .

WALTER LEON SPAIN; #3 Glen Iris Parkway, Birminghan,
Alabama, furnished the following:
a

In the Spring of 1967, SPAIN's son, WALTER E, SPAIN,
gave Mr. SPAIN a .38 caliber Liberty snub-nose revolver,
which his son had purchased in late 1966 or early 1967 from
‘a gun dealer near Atlanta, Georgia. His son owed Mr. SPAIN
some money and the gun was a partial payment of this debt,

In the Fall of 1967, after having been hospitalized
‘in August, 1967, at Huntsville, Alabama, for an illness and
being in need of money to pay bills, Mr. SPAIN sold many
personal items by msans of placing want ads for these items
in the "Birmingham News." Among the items sold was the .38
caliber Liberty snub-nose revolver. Mr. SPAIN recalled he
placed an ad for this gun in a Sunday paper, and that same _ >
Sunday he received a call from a.man who asked about the. gun,
the price, and the directions to get to SPAIN's residence.
The caller said he was in the western section of Birminghan.
About an hour after this call, and while SPAIN's wife and
daughter were at church, a man came to the front door and
said he had called about the gun. He looked at the gun,
, Stated he had been looking for a gun of the same type, and
when told again that the price was $65.00, he gave SPAIN
two twenty dollar bills, two ten dollar bills, and a five
dollar bill, after saying he would take it. SPAIN did not
give the man a receipt for the money, nor did he record his
name or see any identification of the man, and he did not
obtain any information as to his name. The man left carrying
the gun in his hand. SPAIN furnished neither ammunition nor
any papers for the gun. !

Pay

se

When the man first arrived, SPAIN observed he had
parked his’ car, described by SPAIN only as a late model,
white or light-colored, on the street in front of SPAIN's
house, a distance of about 150 feet. SPAIN did not pay
any further attention to the car. SPAIN did recall the
buyer saying he lived in the western section of Birmingham,

WALTER_E,, SPAIN,/2904 ~ 42nd Avenue North
Birmingham, Alabama, furnished the following: ,

Sometime in December, 1965, SPAIN went to Atlanta,
Georgia, with his father, WALTER LEON SPAIN, so his father
“could attempt to obtain employment. While in Atlanta, '
WALTER E, SPAIN saw an advertisement in a newspaper for a
o38 caliber Liberty snub-nose revolver, which was being
sold by a gun dealer in a small town outside Atlanta,
believed to be Mapleton, Georgia. SPAIN, accompanied by
his father, went to this gun dealer and bought the gun and
SPAIN returned it to his residence in Birmingham, Alabama.

In the Spring of 1967, SPAIN gave the gun to his
father in partial payment of a debt he owed to his father.
SPAIN was later told by his father that he had sold the
gun after placing a want ad for it in a Birmingham newspaper.
SPAIN was not present when his father sold the gun and

therefore did not see the purchaser,
