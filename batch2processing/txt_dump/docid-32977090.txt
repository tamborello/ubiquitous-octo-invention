except for the fact that paragraph IV.E. ,j refer ing to the use of Gayc)

Bund d some question about paragraph IV.B., with ultc b
respect toff submarine ctivity, and there was considerable discussion ]
as to the icat of paragraph IV.D., on sabotage.

The Group agreed, however, that paragraphs A., B., C.,
and D. under IV were accepted in principle, with the understanding
that major actions under these general concepts would be approved
by the Special Group (Augmented).

In connection with the latter point, it was emphasized
that such approval should be obtained from the Group far enough in
advance so as to obviate extensive preparations and planning for
operations which might not actually receive policy approval.

2. General Taylor then distributed a draft of new guidelines
for Operation MONGOOSE, Phase II, and a draft of a covering memo-
randum for the President. The latter was approved by the Group as
presented. With respect to the guidelines, paragraph 4 was amended
to read "Efforts will be increased to inspire frictions and
schisms . . ." In addition, it was agreed that a new paragraph
would be added to cover the possibility of assisting Cuban exile
groups and other Latin American governments in undertaking actions
and operations in support of this program.

3. It was agreed that after the new guidelines and covering
memorandum are approved by higher authority, General Lansdale will
prepare detailed schedules of proposed operations for presentation

to the Special Group (Augmented).
