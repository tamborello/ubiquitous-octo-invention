Anthony Doria is a labor racketeer, who was kicked out
of the AFL-CIO in 1957. He reportedly is the "“behind-the-scenes"
man in two independent labor unions which were organized in Los
Angeles in 1958. Doria has been reported in the past as being
close to Hoffa. Dick Kavner is an‘international‘organizer of the
Teamsters Union, who has been reported as working directly under
both Hoffa and Harold J. Gibbons, Executive Vice President of the
Teamsters Union. Kavner was indicted in St. Louis, Missouri,
in 1954, for violating the Anti-Racketeering Statute, but this
indictment later was dismissed without prosecution. (92-1100)

 

 

The field has been instructed to undertake an immediate,
thorough investigation in this case.
