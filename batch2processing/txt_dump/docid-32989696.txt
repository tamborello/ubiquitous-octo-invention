By memorandum dated 12/19/75 to. the Attorney General, baw
advised the Department of Justice that we were opposed to furnishing
captioned Committee information concerning proprietaries: in response
to their letter of 12/1/75, since ‘they are on-going Bureau - operations.
We further advised the Department that we had afforded the {Committee
a briefing concerning these operations in as detailed a mariner as -
possible without compromising. the operations.

On 12/30/75 at the request of Rex Lee, Assistant Rttorney
General of the Civil Division of the Department; Deputy Assistant
Director Fred Fehl; SA John McHale; Section Chief William O. Cregar;
and SA Paul V. Daly met with Mr. Lee, his assistant Thomas Martin A
and Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination Stever/,
Blackhurst concerning. the captioned Committee's request for info
mation pertaining to proprietaries.

It was brought to Mr. Lee's ‘attention at that time of
the Bureau's concern relative to the disclosure of the requested
information to captioned Committee and of the Bureau's position

. that the information requested should not be furnished. It was
pointed out ‘to Mr. Lee that such disclosure might adversely impact
on the on-going sensitive operations of the Bureau and create un-
necessary risks. to the physical well-being of Bureau Agents and
informants: and with ‘regard to the proprietaries operating in the
criminal field, jeopardize prosecutidns'. Aa

Mr. Lee explained that he was sympatits to the Bureau's
position; however, Mike Duval at the White House had instructed
him to attempt to reach ‘some accommodation concerning. this request.
According. to Mr. Lee, this was, prompted by a conéern at the White
House that the House Select Committee might not Oh by their

SUBJECT: House Select Committee Letter dated October 20

Attached is a letter from the House Select Committee
dated October 20, 1975, which this Office received on
October 28, 1975. Apparently the HSC is interested
primarily in reviewing materials developed as a result
of an FBI investigation into this matter which was done
at the request of the Civil Rights Division of the
Department. The HSC also wants to know what documents,
if any, have been turned over to Mr. Ballew or his
attorney either as a result of a civil suit concerning
this or as the result of a Freedom of Information Act
request. If you have questions concerning an appro-
priate response to this letter, please contact
Steve Blackhurst of my staff.

At 10:47 a.m. on January 5, 1976, Joseph Leo Gormley,
formerly employed in the FBI Laboratory, advised that he retired June 30,
1973, and currently is employed at IACP, telephone number 948-0922, Ext. 248.

Mr. Gormy said that he was contacted by Richard Vermeire
of the House Intelligence Committee who requested him to be available for an
interview this afternoon concerning FBI purchases from the U.S. Recording
Company. Hetold me that he had no personal knowledge of such purchases
and he requested advice from the Bureau as to his response to Vermeire..

the obligation of any secrecy agreement he may have signed with the FBI

for purposes of the interview with Vermeire concerning the subject matter
indicated. I told him that should the interview concern other matters, he
should be aware that he is not being relieved of the obligation to protect the
identities of confidential informants, not interfere with pending investigations,
not disclose information obtained from third party sources, and not disclose
sensitive investigative techniques. I also told Mr. Gormley that should the
proposed interview appear to require the advice of counsel to assist him, such
could be made available upon his request. He indicated that because he has N
no pezsonal knowledge of the U.S. Recording Company or the Bureau's
purchasing practices, he felt that he had no need to request counsel at this

time. Silly Re GAC 46 - OPI
Mr. Gormley said that he would call Vermeire and agree to the

By letter dated 10/20/75, received at the Bureau
11/4/75 (copy attached}, the House Select Committee (HSC)
requested that it be furnished with copies of all materials
contained in FBI files pertaining to the shooting of
Kenyon F. Ballew in Silver Spring, Maryland, on 6/7/71.
This shooting occurred when representatives of the Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms Division and local police officers
broke into the Ballew apartment with a warrant charging
Ballew with unregistered possession of firearms and explosives.
As a result of the incident, Ballew was wounded and suffered

a crippling injury. He filed suit against the Government

and the Civil Rights Division of the Department requested

this Bureau to conduct what amounted to a minimal amount of
investigation in this matter,

 

On 11/12/75, Special Agent (SA) Thomas J. McNiff,
after a conference with SAs Paul V. Daly, Legal Counsel
Division, and John J. Boyd, General Investigative Division,
discussed the propriety of the above request with Steven
Blackhurst, Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,
Department of Justice, as the request did not appear to fall
within the HSC mandate as outlined in H. R. 591. ‘youd |

The Attorney General ~

NOTE:

By memorandum from Mr. W. R. Wannall to Mr. J. B. Adams,
dated 10/16/75, captioned as above, approval was obtained for transmittal
of a preliminary response, dated 10/17/75, to Congressman Pike's request
for FBI views on the future of the intelligence community. In our preliminary
response, we indicated that our views would be furnished at an early date
following consultation with appropriate FBI personnel.

Since transmittal of our 10/17/75 preliminary response, we have
learned that the heads of other member-agencies of the intelligence community
have received a similar request from the Congressman. In addition, we have
been informed that the Attorney General has met with White House officials
and determined that it would not be appropriate for us to make specific
recommendations in response to the Congressman's letter. The communication
to Congressman Pike attached for the Attorney General's approval sets forth
general observations on the future of the intelligence community and is
responsive both to the Congressman's inquiry and to the Attorney General's
determination that our reply should avoid specific recommendations.
