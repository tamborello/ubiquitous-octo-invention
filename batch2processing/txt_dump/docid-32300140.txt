Tho Bureau canret atrega tea strongly the need for extmame

of the utmost theroughness in order to exhaust overy minute detail
of infoxaation which Bray may be able to provide in comection
with the investigations mentioned hereia and tho activities of
Hopos, the Borfmann and related matters.

 

The Bureau dees. not coneur with the observations of the .

various bonding programs of the Teamsters Unien. Stewart B. Bosps, : }
nentioned in the enclosures, hag seen described as a reinsurance expert =
and alleged awindler. He was convicted recently in Baltimero Federal
Gourt on charges of Mail Fraud in conmection with the operatien of

one of his dusurance companies. Infersation has been developed to the _
effect that Ropps was involved at the time the original negotiations 4
were conducted in settling up the Teametera Bonding Program, Durdag
Hopps* reesat trial im Baltimore he became: friendly with Pestal
Inspoeter Alton d, Hurray and at that timc he indicated to Murray

that he bed information concerning Hoffa which could be useiul to the
Department of dugtice. The enclosed decumonts relates to various contacts
