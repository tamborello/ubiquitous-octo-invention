at a later date that, though he was working with FPCC, he was cooperating) +
with U. 8. officials; ¥6) - , &

he enjoys living well and traveling first-class, It has been reported xX
that he is presently having financial difficulties.

If subject desires to cooperate with U. S. Government, it is
not known why he.did not contact us. He certainly must be aware of our
interest in FPCC] i There is a good chance that since he thought| Reiss wad)
still with CIA, [Reiss might serve as an "in" for him. WhateveF subject's. .
reason was in cofitacting CIA, Bit is not felt we should pass up this (S) 7
opportunity to contact hin. rc investigation of the FPCC developed dafa
from inadmissible sources that FPCC received money from Cuban Government. j¥ |
We have been attempting to make Registration Act case on FPCC and Gibson f
