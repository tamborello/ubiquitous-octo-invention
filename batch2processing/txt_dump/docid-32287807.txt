Re Miami airtel 5/14/62.

You should maintain close contact with PCI Joseph
Hegeman and immediately report any information he receives
concerning a possible future meeting of racket attorneys,
He should be closely interviewed on all aspects of any future
information he furnishes in this regard.

 

 

 

Las Vegas advises that Norman Biltz is a wealthy
Reno, Nevada, financier who has no known hoodium connections.
Why Carlos Marcello should send Biltz $8700 in cash as part
payment for attorneys fees is not cléar. Clarify this infor-
mation on your next contact with informant.

alleged meeting of hoodlum attorneys in Reno, Nevada, Saturddy,

General's organized crime drive. Informant stopped in Reno on
return trip from Los Angeles omMay 11 to deliver $6700 to Norman |
Biltz and also on the possibility he might get some type of public
relations assignment from the racket attorneys. Upon arrival ing
Reno informant was told by Norman Biltz that meeting had been
‘called off because of a leak in the plans. Since meeting was
called off, we have been unable to determine validity of informant's
information and Miami is therefore being instructed to pin informant
