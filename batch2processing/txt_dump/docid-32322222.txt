Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Act of 1992 (the Act)
Synopsis: Detroit is requested to forward the documents listed
below to the JFK Task Force as soon as possible due to an
extremely short deadline.

Details: Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act of 1992 (JFKARCA) any material considered
assassination records must be made available to the National
CO Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original
form. The JFKARCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain
information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be
maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in
full. Therefore, the documents will not be returned to Detroit.

Since the originals will be sent to the NARA, copies of
the documents should be made for record purposes prior to
shipment to FBIHQ. The documents should be received at FBIHQ no
later than C.0.B. 05/08/98.

Please ship the following documents to FBIHQ, JFK Task

Force, Attention Catherine L. Lamey, Room 11144.
