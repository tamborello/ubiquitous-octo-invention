2. .A.. FBI furnishing,in 1966, White House with "dossiers"

on critics of Warren Commission. B. Tom H. Boggs, Jr. Va
Lr

 

i :
claims that his father, in 1970, gave him FBI furnished by

dossiers on Warren Commission critics.

Facts: A. At the request of Marvin, Watson in 1966,

the FBI furnished him with background memos on seven
writers critical-of the Warren Commission. Included as
part of this transmission was a photograph of one of the
seven writers in a situation best described as "well, uh,
private," perverse and utterly without any value, save the
sexyally deviate. ‘(The SSC staff refused to even look at
the picture, but has received verbal and written
description.)

B. In January 1975, Tom Boggs » son of the late
Congressman Hale Boggs, disclosed that in 1970, his father
received similar dossiers and the picture.

The FBI and Boggs documentary material (the FBI
denies a dissimination to Boggs) compare only slightly and
two similarly typed dossiers are dated differently. We

await information from FBI on further dissimination.
