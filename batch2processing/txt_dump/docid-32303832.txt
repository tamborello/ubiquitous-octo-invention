4, Attempt to obtain photostats of all of the
above- -requested ‘items, noting that this data would be of
utmost importance in successful prosecution of ANGELO i
BRUNO for tax violations within the U.S. In obtaining
such information, the correspondent bank cashing drafts
in the U.S. should be obtained .so that these records
could be properly subpoenaed. In this regard, the
First National Bank of Miami and the Chase National Bank
of New York are believed to be correspondent banks for
the Royal Bank of Canada. Leads are presently outstanding
to endeavor to obtain the above type of information from
these correspondent banks which will not, however, have as
complete details as could be obtained from the Royal Bank
of Canada. for

“"In the Dominican Republic, if sources are presently
available, it is requested’ that GLADSTONE CUMBERHATCH be
_contacted in the Dominican Republic for his knowledge of the

, ‘payments listed in the enclosed letterhead memo, his willingness

to testify in this regard, and his complete knowledge of ANGELO
BRUNO, particularly his knowledge as to any investments, business
‘holdings, or financial transactions that involved ANGELO BRUNO. Qa Ww

fir sources are available that can deal directly with

the branch of the Royal Bank of Cafddd in Cuidad; Trujillo,

it may be possible to short-cut efforts to obtain desired
information at the branch bank in the Dominican Republic ;

rather than through channels as gutlined in the request [a ae mee
for the Legal Attache in Canada. t is to be noted that ar a rr
ANGELO BRUNO has been designated a8 target for "early
"prosecution" in the Bureau's Criminal Intelligence Program,

resulting in intensive investigative effort by the Bureau. (u) ©
