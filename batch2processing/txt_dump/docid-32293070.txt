 £ Re New York airtel 6/30/61 enclosing letterhead memorandum
w regarding Delesseps Morrison.

“New York should maintain close contact with PCI
for further developments involving Morrison and Albert Emke in
International Time, Inc., and possible involvement with this organization
by Carlos Marcello. You should also attempt to further identify (FNU) Diaz,
a Venezuelan national, described in your airtel. Particular emphasis
should be placed on whether or not the underworld is investing money in
this organization.

New York should further identify Emke throug for

the benefit of New Orleans and the Bureau to determine if he is identical
, with Albert Joseph Emke, former president of the Hibernia Homestead
and Savings Association (HHSA), New Orleans, Louisiana. Emke of the
| BHHSA of New Orleans has been the subject of a Federal Reserve Act case
by the Bureau, and according to latest correspondence from New Orleans
in this case, trial of Emke and associates for embezzlement of funds'
from the HHSA is scheduled for July 18, 1961, at New Orleans.

 

New Orleans should insure that the Bureau is appropriately
informed of any further developments concerning International Time, Inc.,
“Tolsen ——and possible involvement in this organization by Carlos Marcello.
