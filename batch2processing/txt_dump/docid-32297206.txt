9. Informant furnished the folowing information on dates
indicated:

On 5/6/63, information concerning FRANK SCIREMAMMANO,
subject of NY 15-25416. Informant alvised that SCIREMAMMANO discussed
with CONNIE NOONAN and AUSTIN FUREY the fact he had been arrested
by the FBI, that he had denied previous arrests to the "Feds", whereas
he had a previous record, and that he believed the "stool pigeon" who
"framed" him did not know him personally. , : : :

On 5/7/63, information re JOHN JAMES NORTON, subject of
NK 15 case, FBI #62676E, and re EDDIE MC GRATH, NY 92-667, and FRANK
"SONNY" CAMPBELL, NY 9-2247. Re NORTON, informant advised that
NOONAN dscribed NORTON to TEDDY GLEASON as "Nunzy's friend" and that
NORTON tried to "bolt into (local) 560" (IBT). NOONAN indicated he
would not bother with NORTON except that NOONAN has been put under
some sort of pressure.

Re MC GRATH and CAMPBELL, informant advised that BERNIE
(LNU) asked NOONAN, “how's the big fellow, EDDIE?" NOONAN's answer
was inaudible. NY 1716-C has advised in the past that the term
"big fellow" is used among NOONAN's associates when referring to EDDIE
MC GRATH. BERNIE (LNU) and NOONAN then discussed SONNY CAMPBELL's
arrest by the FBI. NOONAN remarked that the best CAMPBELL could hope
for would be a-hung jury.

On. 5/15/63, information re TEDDY GLEASON discussing the
fact that TONY PROVENZANO and JIMMY HOFFA attemptai to intercede in a pending
local 1730 ILA strike because it would "louse up" the Teamsters.

On 5/22/63, information re comments of CONNIE NOONAN and
AUSTIN FUREY re the arrest of BUSTER BELL and the fct that JIMMY HOFFA
should pay for BELL's trial expenses because BELL "did it for him".

On 5/28/63, and 6/6/63, information re TONY PROVENZANO
and WALTER GLOCKNER Murder, NY 72-164, NK 72-58. On 5/28/63, NOONAN in
discussing the then current TONY PROVENZANO trial and the GLOCKNER
murder, remarked that whoever did the murder, was not a friend of TONY
PRO's and that it never should have happened while PRO was on trial.
It was informant's- opinion that NOONAN was not so much referring to
the fact that a man was murdered but that the timing of the murder
was inappropriate for TONY PRO.

On 6/6/63, NOONAN, FUREY, GLEASON and two unknown individuals
discussed the TONY PRO trial and the murder of GLOCKNER. NOONAN remarked
that he was "in Hoboken that day when it happened and got told by some-
body that he was in that car". This was in answer to a remark by one
of the two unknown individuals to the effect that "he's been identified

being in the car --- him an, a fellow by the name of WALSH, ( na .
