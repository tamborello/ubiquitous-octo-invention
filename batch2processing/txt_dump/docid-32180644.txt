something Constructive. This Gill recently, a: few years ~
_or’less ago Made a trip to the Soviet Union ete on ‘the
Youth Conference Know as the ‘World ‘Youth Conference. '

He will probably emerge from the ‘New York thing as a”

full time - organizer in some special field suchas, youth.

At the start of the Meeting Genne: brought out
her brief case full of clipbings . (Newspaper) etc she
, also had a lot of penciled notes which she was
undoubtedly going to use to show what she was doing
j and. to give others: hell for not co-operating with her.

But the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around
the late Pres. Kennedy. ;

Arnold explained that since Oswald was. considered a”

Communist then a wave of hysteria was about: to explode

against the C. party of America but by the time ‘the

re-actionaries were getting started it was announced ; ms
that it had been disclosed that it seemed like the tet
extreme Sight had been’ active. This was bore out — a
by the declaration of Russia that it was not the

C. party that had done it because Kennedy was a

friend of the Working class but the work of the extreme
right or almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober
the masses that it was the same caliber of people who
had insulted Stevenson only Weeks before in Dallas,
Texas.

 

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about this
Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he
told them he gets legs of letters of enquiry about the
Cc. party and he proba ly answered it as he does hundreds.
of others and even sent him literature if he requested
it. They (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on the air with 4 @
statement but he, stgted to them he would have to dig the*
letter out and: be: sure before he Made any statement, —

’ Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson if when he got back. to
New York to look in the files if: he had a letter from 4

Wn Pokas, formerly from Bellaire, Ohio, and also ani

immate of Cambridge ‘Asylum for a period of time, Gorby
