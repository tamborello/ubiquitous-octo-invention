Palmer stated that he thought the statement by~ the
Methodist Minister’ Covered the situation yery good
when he stated that the fact that the Murder of Bill
Moore, M Edgar Evers and others in the, south going
by without punishment had set the stage for the
Assassination of Pres. Kennedy, Everyone readily
agreed,

‘Arnold Johnson further stated that no real Marxist:

She stated that about the tims of the Civil Rights
March on Washington a few days before she had been
working with CORE and NAACP the reporter from the
Wheeling paper Intelligencer had Called and wanted

to talk about her. She gave him answers on the

phone and finally hung up on him. from the time

this phone conversation was completed She had been
quoted im the newspaper and exposed as a Communist
party Member, which brought-about her expolsion from
the W.A.A.C.P., but simce has been restored to
Meabership, Then lately a Man (Negro) by name of Johnson
head of the local CORE group was indicted for robbing a
bus driver in Steubenville, Ohio. Genne had got in
touch with R. Gorby as she thought Johnson was being
fvamed. Gorby found out and told her at this Meeting
that he had did the robbing and was Not being framed,
The best thing to do stated Gorby was to give him
