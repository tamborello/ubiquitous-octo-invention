  

had indicated in writing to DC/oPS Staff, that he has no
objection for Mr. Belin to do whatever is desired with
these photographs: at. this time. It should be noted that
Mr. Fensterwald in 1971 - 1972 was actually shown, by
Mr. Houston during a visit to the Agency, two. of the
twelve photographs, other than the one already published

- in the Warren Commission report. (It is these two that:
he has published in The New York Review of Books article
which Mr. Belin attaches to his mémorandum.) i

. t .
7. .It seems. to me that whoever makes a decision on
whether the entire matter. can. be fully disclosed at this
-time. should. bear. in. mind. that.a subsidiary decision must
lso be made, i.e., whether to crop or.otherwise fuzz up
the: background:of the photographs or, alternatively, to
‘publish the entire run of the photographs. for the first
, , time without taking out the background. . Obviously, none
of these questions. apply to the passage: of this material |
to Mr. Belin and the Rockefeller..Commission itself. I
think they ‘should’ see the entire documentation as it
“stands. Perhaps after that, the question of. what could
be discussed and the question of “how?" and “how much?"
could be. taken up. with Mr. Belin himself: My personal.
recommendation is that the more we can say about this
matter in.a. fully. open and final. manner, the better off
we will be..as an Agency. But it is my understanding .
-that there are still sensitive.aspects. deriving, from the : |
_ fact that the operation which produced the photographs
was jointly run with Mexican liaison and as. a consequence
publication at this. time would’ create ‘additional problems
at that level.in Mexico. Also, it. should be notéd that >
. the ‘Ambassador.’ ‘according to Win Scott's memorandum to
; Z November 1963. (see Ttem 8 in the backup_
documentation) ;.“allegedly played a a@irect- role’ in the
decision .to: put the photographs into“the hands of the FBI
‘in Dallas\ laterally from the Field. As far as I know,
there has.° -been anything published. about this aspect
at any timéJin the past nor have we had any discussions
with the State Department about that asyect of the matter. |

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy chief, ‘Operations | Staff

SUBJECT 8 Review of Agency Holdings regarding.
uo : Photograph of Unidentified Individual
‘in Mexico City published. by the’
‘Warren Commission

REFERENCE “3. Letter dated.15 April 1975 by
“5~* Mr. David W..Belin, Executive Director
of the Commission on CIA Activities
within the United States, to - :
“ Mr.. EL Henry Knoche (copy attached to
accompanying report)”

 

1. This is further toy. and. in completion of, my
interim memorandum of a few weeks” ago. -

2. The. attachment isa detailed ‘review in narrative,
_chronological: ‘order=together-with’appropriate comment~
ary — of. our extensive holdings:on the OSWALD case that
have a bearing on the matter of photographs taken by
Mexico. City: Station’on 1, 4 and 15 October 1963 of an
Unidentified Individual. As a consequence of a combina-
tion: of analytical error, misjudgement and under the
stress of an urgent desire to.contribute to the develop-
ment of the investigation of the assassination, a
cropped version of.one of the photographs of the
Unidentified Individual was introduced into the chain of
evidence in. the OSWALD case on 23 November 1963 by an
FBI representative in Dallas. The successive vicissi-
tudes which have now made this event a cause celebre
right down to the present moment are detailed in the

-narrative.:

3. The attached report is not intended to be an
“answer. to the Fensterwald/O'Toole article which Mr. Belin
attaches to his memorandum. (I have prepared a paragraph-
by-paragraph refutation and comment on that article,
which I believe is more appropriately handled by a sepa-
rate memorandum to Mr. Belin, and I will prepare this as
a Memorandum if that is desired.) .

4. The point of the referenced memorandum is that
consideration should be given now to "whether or.not the
entire matter can be fully disclosed at this time. This
submission is designed to make it possible for you, the
IG and others whom you may desire to consult to make this
decision. The narrative-interpretive summary has been
put together in such.a way that it discloses no cyptonyms,
pseudonyms.or other CIA jargon. However, its contents go
well. beyond what has been released to the public thus far
in the Warren Commission documentation. This point must
be borne .in mind in making a decision on Mr. Belin's
question. To remove any question in anybody's mind about
our good faith in this matter, the narrative is backed up
by copies of actual documentation from our files. It
seems to me necessary, in reply to Mr. Belin, that he or
his representative review the documentation that backs up
the narrative. The documentation has not been keyed into
the narrative presentation, but it follows the chronologi-
cal order of presentation from 9 October into the latest
developments in the matter, and there is an overall index
to facilitate reference to individual items. [NB: There

is only one copy of this collection; this is it. oT

5. As” noted above, one of the photographs taken in

Mexico City-on.4 October 1963 was. introduced into the
Warren Commission public record.:: However;..it was..intro-
duced intothat. record in two cropped versions. The

- Warren Commission and its staff were made fully aware in

: the course of their inquiry at Headquarters and in
Mexico City of the origins of the photograph, the fact
that we had additional photographs of the same individual
taken at different times in Mexico City and on the basis
of full knowledge of these facts reached their own con-
clusions regarding the irrelevance of the photograph to
OSWALD and the assassination. .

6. In fact, we actually hold twelve different photo-
. graphs of the Unidentified Individual. Each of these age /S
' reproduced in the collected documentation backing up the
narrative report (see Items 25 - 27). Chief, LA Division,
