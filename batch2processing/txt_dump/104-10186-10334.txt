source A former Cuban IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelligence
Service until April 1964.

1. The Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of
Intelligence - DGI) overseas field-station chief has no respon-
Sibility for physical or other security of the Cuban Embassy or
Mission, nor does any member of his staff.

2. The DGI would not use a regular foreign-service officer in the
field because he has not been cleared and briefed and is not,
therefore, considered qualified for intelligence tasks. If a
foreign-service officer is briefed, it may be assumed that he
has been cleared and that he is thereafter considered a member
of the DG (at least by the DGI). On returning to Havana per-
manently, Such a foreign-service officer briefed for a field
assignment normally would be sent to DGE Headquarters rather
than to the Ministry of Foreign Relations.
