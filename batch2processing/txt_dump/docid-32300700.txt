that SAM may have a substantial .financial interest in

that SAMUEL MANNARINO has. never.spoken openly of his interest

-of it thaty re is actually some ill feelings between SAMUEL
and GABRIEELMANNARINO as a result of a venture into the juke

4

ipox business several years ago in which they lost a hugh amount

of cash. According to ZERVIS, the business was located in .
Chicago, Illinois, and -connected in some way with the Wurletizer -
yCompany, and that Attorney CHARLES MARGIOTTI, now deceased, :
was involved in the-deal and also lost a considerable amount

of money.

ZERVIS explained that during the time the MANNARINO brothers
were attempting to set up this business in Chicago, SAM
MANNARINO actually took charge of the enterprise and ‘spent

a great deal of time in Chicago. ZERVIS said. that when things
pegan to'go wrong, SAM would write to GABRIEL for additional
money and that GABRIEL was forced to:borrow money, but instead
of sending SAM the full sum he borrowed, he would send. only
half of it and retain the other half. : .

ZERVIS said that after the business venture in Chicago
failed, GABRIEL!MANNARINO seemed to control the purse strings.
and has continued to'do so since that time. . :
ZERVIS ‘said that GABRIEL MANNARINO has told him personally
that he was forced to push his brother, SAMUEL, in the back-
ground because he could not resist the temptation of spending
four and five: thousand dollars in.one-night like he did in'the
days ‘they had the slot machines going in Westmoreland dounty.

ERVIS remarked that he recently had a-conerSation with DAN
CEL Chief of Police, New Kensington,’ about the raids
eondu py the Internal Revenue Service in New Kensington
on..January' 6, 1958. ZERVIS stated that ZELOYLE told him that
he is. sick and tired of being embarrassed- because of GABRIEL
MANNARION and added that on the day of the raids an Agent of
the Internal Revenue Service came to the Police Station to
notify him that a raiding party was in town and at that time
were raiding various clubs in the.city. ZERVIS stated ‘that -
ZELOYLE indicated that this action onthe part of the Internal
Revenue Service embarrassed him because he had the very definite
feeling that the Internal Revenue Service did not trust him
with any advance warnings of the raids.
