‘(FBIS Translated Text} .A group of investigators, eight U.S.
and tvo Cuban, have just held a meeting in Rio de Janedto, Brazil.
The group analyzed the political circumstances, direct causes, and
main responsibility for the aysassination of U.S. President John F.
Kennedy in November 1963. Tt is interesting to point out that 32
years after, the Dallas assassination, vell-tounded doubts continue
to grow over the official reports piven act that time.

.« TEXT: , :

A seminar entitled: JFK, The Truth Revealed vas organized by the
Rie de Janeiro authorities in late August in that capital city.
~ 2 EXT: .

During that seminar, Cuban and U.S. experts agreed to rule out
the: theory of a sole killer, vhich is the main conclusion of the
report issued by the Uarcen Commission. The commission vas
appointed was by the U.S. government to investigate the case. .

.- TEXT: H ;

U.S. lavyer Vayne Smith, former chiet of the U.S. Interest Office
in Havana, said he was convinced U.S. secret services and Cuban —
counterrevolutionary elements had plotted to murder President
Keanedy for not authorizing new aggressions agsinst Cuba, atter the
foiled 1961 mercenary invasion. Wayne Smith said that, after 30
years of studies and investigations by specialists from non-
governmental U.S. organizations, it had been established that
President Kennedy had rejected the plan of implementing new anti-
Cuban operation in 1963; the same year in vhich he vas shot to death =
in Dallas. |

- TEXT: :
Yt is not futile to recall that ducing those days of
counterrevo lutionary effervescence -~ sponsored, promoted, and
financed by the government in Washington -- attempts vere made to

build a case against the Cuban government on charges that if vas

cesponsible for this crime. The allegation was that the Cuban
government vas' retaliating for the Bahia de Cochinos action. At
that time, 1t was said that the Cuban government had hired several
U.S. Hafia criminals to carry out the attack. There vas a great
deal of speculation about accused Lec Harvey CUswald’s visits to
Noscow and Wavana, where he allegedly trained fer the Dallas
oper ition. !

JTEXT: |

‘Division General Fabian Escalante, from the Cuban Interior
Ministry, represented Cuba at the seminar. He based his thesis on
the fact that rhe Cuban counterrevulution had played a fundamental
tole in the assassination. Gen. Escalante presented a vell-
documented, position to back his theory and was widely-praised by the
seminar’s pacticipants. Other theories presented at this event
peoinced tol the collusion between the U.S. Central Intelligence

Agency and|the Cuban counterrevolution sectors, mainly located in
tie city of Mtami.
.-TBXT:

Recently, several secret documents from the Wacren Commission’s

. investigations were revealed. They sre evidently intended to, weaken

the strength of versions that vere closer to the truth. Another lot
of evidence, hovever, vas left in the shadov. It vill most surely
be revealed; when the good and bad people related to this historic
episode have died. .

1 December 1995
Note for: C/HRG

Subject: ARRB request re Fabian Escalant Font

‘yt

1. The following is a gist of my phone call Thursday
afternoon (30 November) with Gunn re his request to see.
Escalant's file(s) *:

' As requested by DO, I told Gunn that. since we had been
unable to link Escalant with the JFK collection or
investigation the issue of relevance had been raised and
that he would not be able to see any files this week.

Gunn response: “This is an issue that they. [ARRB staf]
takes seriously... if we [Agency] want a ‘formal request 4.4
would prepare one this afternoon...not a fishing expedition
...information from a credible source in Johnson White
House... [information] linked to 1964 and CIA...”

i

I suggested that we discuss after he returned from the
Conference. He indicated agreement.

2. Gunn may change his mind and send over a formal
request anyway; he clearly plans to pursue this issue. I
recommend we ask Gunn to be more specific in terms of
Escalant's relevance to the JFK assassination story,
timeframe and what he is looking for; this could be done
either. in a meeting with him or ina formal request. He has
mentioned in each of his conversations that the Agency may
not want this to be a formal written request, but is vague
on why.

3. See attached article for Escalant's current
activities re JFK Assassination story.

*(Gunn first raised the issue of Escalant several weeks ago;
last week he ask if it would be possible to view the file
prior to attending a conference on the JFK Assassination
that Escalant would also be attending] .
