“informant. Philadelphia Office reports that during the brtefous
period of time it has been activated there have not been any meetings
at the apartment. This is partially due to the informant's work
schedule. The informant is endeavoring to arrange an appointment
with Angelo Bruno, head of La Cosa Nostra in Philadelphia, to request

permission to use the apartment in connection with Bruno's numbers

Remarks (By SAC):
_ AS previously explained, the purpose of this installation

was to have the installation so that technical coverage could

. be afforded meetings between SCAFIDI, a known member of La Cosa
Nostra, and his associates. It is also a means to check the
reliability of SCAFIDI, who is PH 672-C-TE. To date the source
has furnished information regarding SCAFIDI's personal activi-
ties. Due to his work schedule, he has been unable to bring

' about many meetings. He is. at the present time endeavoring to

arrange an appointment with Commission member ANGELO BRUNO to

‘obtain permission from BRUNO to allow his apartment to be used
two or more days weekly in BRUNO's illegal numbers operation.

' This will furnish information heretofore unavailable to this
division, if the source is successful in accomplishing this
arrangement. It is therefore recommended that this source be
continued considering that it has not had any breach of security
