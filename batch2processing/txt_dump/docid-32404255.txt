FROM: Jd. Barry Harrelson, JFK Project
Officer
DCI/CSI/HRG
VIA: Lee Burton

Chief, DCI Administrative SVCS

SUBJECT: Courier Service between IP and
ARRB Office

1. As a result of the move of the Center for the Study of
Intelligence (CSI) to International Point Building in Chantilly,
Virginia, the Agency’s JFK project is in immediate need of same
day courier service from International Point to the offices of
the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) at 600 E Street
N.W., Washington, DC. The JFK record review is a DCI priority.

2. Background: The ARRB is a Presidential-appointed board
reviewing CIA records related to the JFK assassination under the
JFK Act of 1992. The Board meets monthly and may act on up to
200-300 CIA documents. The law sets specific deadlines for
notification of the DCI, appeals and release of reviewed records.
There is a continuing, but not necessarily daily, flow of
material between the CSI/Historical Review Group and the staff of
the WARRB to meet the requirements of the law . This material

‘incFadés time sensitive memoranda for the DCI and documents that

frequently must be delivered the same day. In the past, the
staffs (HRG and ARRB) have hand-carried the material when using
the FAX was not satisfactory or appropriate. With the move to
IP, it is no longer possible to have staffers hand-carry material
on a regular basis.

3. Requirements:

a. Same-day Delivery to 600 E. St. NW: Generally HRG
will know at least the day before that delivery is needed,
however, there are times when same-day service to and from 600 E
Street will be requested. For most outgoing material, HRG will
use the regular morning courier service between IP and HQs
prowmded that priority packages are delivered to the ARRB that
afternoon. Non-priority material can be delivered the following
day.
