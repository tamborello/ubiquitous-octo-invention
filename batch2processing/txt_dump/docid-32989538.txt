When Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING was invited to address
the AFL-CIO convention some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's ad-
vice, first obtained approval to do so from A, PHILLIP RANDOLPH,
negro labor leader, who, if he had not been consulted in the
matter, might have felt that KING's making a speech at the
aforesaid convention was a blow to RANDOLPH's prestige.

: KING delivered a remarkably effective speech at the
AFL-CIO convention; and, asa result, received invitations
from numerous labor leaders, including "MC DONALD of Steel,"
to address their respective unions. As the outstanding
champion of negro rights in the country, KING is a powerful
political influence, recognized as such by the higher echelons
of the Democratic Party. He has access to Attorney General
ROBERT KENNEDY and President KENNEDY, who, politically, need
KING, particularly in the South, where in cities like Atlanta
and New Orleans the negro vote now constitutes the balance of
power, and where KING controls the negro vote.

JAMES HOFFA, Teamsters Union "boss" appreciates
the political power of KING, particularly the fact that KING
ean influence the 90,000 negro members of the Teamsters
Union. HOFFA invited KING to address the Teamsters Union,
and KING accepted the invitation. Knowing that KING is being
deferred to by Attorney General KENNEDY, and President KENNEDY,
HOFFA requested KING to contact the Attorney General in an
effort to influence the latter "to lay off" HOFFA, KING was
inclined to do as HOFFA requested, but LEVISON “convinced him
that to do so would be politically unwise, inexpedient, and
likely to be a "boomerang," since the Attorney General would
Hora accede to such a request, particularly in the casé@ of -
HOFFA, ia

LEVISON had to steer KING away from another politi-
cally hazardous situation. Some months ago OTTO PREMINGER,
Hollywood movie director, entered into negotiations with a
KING representative for KING to play a part in a picture
which PREMINGER woulddirect, Although PREMINGER's offer was
"tempting," since it meant "fast, easy money" for KING's
organization, LEVISON realized that for KING to accept the
offer would lower the latters prestige. After convincing
KING of this fact, LEVISON personally telephoned to PREMINGER,
telling him that "the deal was off.".

for civil rights for Negroes, and further, since they feel
that the Party, as a result of this "do nothing" attitude,
has lost prestige, they will no longer permit the Party

to dominate or control their activities in the MARTIN LUTHER
KING movement. They are severing themselves, financially
and in a disciplinary way, from the Party. The LEVISONS
and O'DELL are still Party members, but do not desire to be
openly "linked up" with the Party. Although they are "dis-
enchanted! with, the Party, they are not quitting the Party.
With respect to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement, they will
act on their own initiative, and will not accept instructions
from the Party. .

, LEM HARRIS then advised that the Party, however,
still would like to control the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement.
BEN DAVIS has been assigned to be "liaison or intermediary"
with the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, Whether or not
the LEVISONS and O'DELL will maintain liaison regarding
.matters concerning the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement is a
matter for them to decide. In view of LEVISON's statement
with respect to advising MARTIN LUTHER KING independently
of Party instructions, it would seem that DAVIS may not have
any success in maintaining liaison with the LEVISONS «and
RUNTER PITTS O'DELL, The LEVISONS and O'DELL are aware of
the fact that BEN DAVIS has been given this assignmen%

by the Party.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, according to LEM HARRIS, is
referred to by such top Party functionaries as GUS HALL,
BEN DAVIS, JIM JACKSON and CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT as a "true,
genuine, Marxist-Leninist from the top of his head to the tips
of his toes." In the Party, the report is that MARTIN LUTHER
KING is following a Marxist-Leninist line. .

NY 694-S* advised that he asked IEM HARRIS whether
or not, to the latter's knowledge, MARTIN LUTHER KING was
a member of the CPUSA, LEM HARRIS replied that he cid not
know.

On 6/13/63, NY 694-S* furnished the following
information to SA ALEXANDER C. BURLINSON:

On 6/12/63, LEMENT HaRRTS,CPUSA Reserve Fund
functionary, told NY 694-S* that ina recent meeting with
STANLEY LEVISON, the latter furnished him the following
information:

The IEVISONS, particularly STANLEY, are still
MARTIN LUTHER KING's "brain trust’--now more than ever before.
This is so despite the fact that at a meeting of STANLEY
LEVISON, ROY LEVISON, HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, MARTIN LUTHER
KING and "the Attorney General's chief assistant", the
Attorney General's assistant, pointing to the LEVISONS
and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, stated to MARTIN LUTHER KING,
"These men are Party members; watch out for them.”

MARTIN LUTHER KING did not "bat an eyelash" upon
hearing the Assistant Attorney General's remark, and after
the latter left the meeting, those in the group smiled at each
other, STANIEY IEVISON said to KING, at this<time, "I
congratulate you on the way you acted regarding his warning.
You are a real Marxist-Leninist. This is how a true
Marxist-Leninist acts."

Everything that KING does he first discusses
with STANLEY IEVISON and he accepts LEVISON's advice whole-
heartedly. KING also wholeheartedly accepts the advice of
HUNTER PITTS O'DELL as regards matters within the latter's
local jurisdiction,

MARTIN LUTHER KING was asked by a group of newspaper
reporters whether he takes orders from "the Communists",
and also, whether he took "orders from STANIEY LEVISON, it
KING's response was that he took orders only from God.

By reason of the fact that the LEVISONS feel that
the Party has done little, if anything, to assist the fight

Ts-c Date

On 4/9/64, NY 694-S* made the following observations
with regard to the CP svatus of STANLEY LEVISON:

LEVISON has been an important Party member for

many years and never at any time differed with-the Party with
respect to the Party line. His only difference with the
Party has been with respect to the fact that in his opinion
the Party was not sufficiently "militant" in defending
Negro rights. In this respect, he has been to the "left"
of the Party. LEVISON's differences with the Party are merely
"tactical." He has never criticized the Party, except with

- respect to the Party's handling of the Negro question. ‘The
fact that he does not accept domination by the Party with
regard to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement should not be
construed to mean that he has broken with the Party in all
respects, The Party today is as anxious to reestablish friendly
relations with LEVISON as it was in the past,

It should be noted that LEVISON never has been
officially "drummed out" of the Party, nor has anyone ever
.criticized him for being opposed to the Party's general
principles. It further should be noted that according to
the CP Constitution, it would require formal expulsion of
LEVISON to state that he is officially out of the Party.

LEVISON never has said anything reflecting that
he does not continue to te a CP member, It should be noted
that it would be in the interests of the MARTIN LUTHER KING
movement, with which he is associated, if he would publicly
repudiate the Party, whitch he has never done, It should be
further noted that in an effort to renew friendly relations

with LEVISON, the Party designated BEN DAVIS to contact
LEVISON, -LEVISON had always expressed the opinion that

BEN DAVIS was the only CP funetionary who had a sufficiently
"Militant attitude" as regards CP activities in behalf of
the Negro movement, The fact that DAVIS and LEVISON as yet
have not met should not be construed to mean that LEVISON
has refused to confer with DAVIS, As NY 694.S* understands
the situation, DAVIS has been awaiting contact by LEVISON,
and LEVISON similarly has been awaiting contact by DAVIS.
Each of these individuals is sufficientiy egotistical to
expect that the other would make the first move in an effort
to establish contact, NY 694-S* believes that probably the
reason why DAVIS and LEVISON have not met is that arrangements
for their meeting were to be made by LEM HARRIS and that-
HARRIS has not made the proper efforts to effect a meeting
between LEVISON and DAVIS.

NY 6904-S* has never obtained any information re-
flecting that LEVISON has changed his thinking with regard to
Marxism, Even though his present estrangement from the Party
might be construed as reflecting he is no longer a CP member,
there is no reason to come to the’ conclusion that LEVISON is
no longer an ideological Communist.

JACK talked to LEM HARRIS yesterday who said he
contacted STAN LEVENSON by phone and was given a cordial
hello which was a change from the past when he was cool.

LEM said he had not seen LEVENSON, tried to call him
and would like to see him immediately to which LEVENSON said,
"ry would like very much to see you but I don't have the time
now, I'm leaving and packing for a trip. I will he glad to
see you in six weeks."

LEVENSON implied that he was going to Eevador but

LEM doesn't know why. ‘There was no anger shown, and LEVENSON
will see LEM when he returns in six weeks.
