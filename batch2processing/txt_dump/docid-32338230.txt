Quintin Pino is apparently identical with Quintin Pino.
Machado, bern 12-21-31 in Cuba, who arrived in the United States
on 10-18-60 at Miami and was destined to the Cuban Embassy,
Washington, D. C. According to INS, Pino was issued a G-1 visa
and it was indicated Pino would be a Cuban United Nations
delegate. According to sources at Cuban Embassy, Washington, D. C.,
Pino has been serving as Cuban Alternate Delegate to the
Organization of American States (OAS). Pino formerly was Cuban
Ambassador to Nicaragua who reportedly was kicked out of
Nicaragua for meddling in internal affairs of Nicaragua. We
already have State Department clearance to investigate him.

Martinez arrived in the United States on 2-13-60 and
has been listed as a clerk at the Cuban Embassy since that time.
On the basis of reports that he was distributing Cuban propaganda;
we obtained State Department clearance to investigate him on
8-1-60. He.has been described as "girl crazy" and when he
arrived in the United States one of his suitcases reportedly
contained a pistol. Through coverage of the Cuban Embassy, we
learned that Martinez had been missing from the Embassy for
a few days and it was indicated that he was in the Baltimore

rea with his girl frien Diana Luz Berrios. On 11/24 & 25/60,
[fe 1133-S* anal 1154-8 ]rurnished partial substantiation of /S
rtinez™ story. These urces indicated that Martinez was at

the Embassy on 11-25-60, had been questioned by Pino and other
Cuban officials, had prepared a letter to “a. Cuban official
requesting five day's leave to marry Berrios and in the letter

he expressed loyalty to Cuba. In addition, the sources learned
that tape recorder:, was used during the questioning of Martinez.
According to another Washington Field source, Martinez planned

to marry Berrios on 11-26-60 and to go to Havana done on 11-27-60.

SA R. A. Mullins discussed this matter with Mr. J. P.
McDonnell of State Department on the morning of 11-27-60 and
McDonnell recalled that some question had arisen over advisability
of admitting Pino to the United States in October, 1960. He
said it was his recollection that Pino had been a "strong arm man"
