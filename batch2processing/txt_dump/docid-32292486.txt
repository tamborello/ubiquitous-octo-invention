The folowing verbatim conversation then was
carried on by ALEX, LADON and SUSK concerning an apparent
attempt by two individuals’ to either gain access to ALEX’

"apartment or photograph the lock on his door. It is pointed
out that subsequent contact with the building manager of
ALEX' apartment indicates that the two unknown individuals
were very possibly Chicago police officers who either at
this time or some future time desired to gain entrance to
ALEX' apartment:

GUS: The door man says rel know them anytime,
he said I got a good look at them,

HENRY: That's just what I was going to ask you,
when they got downstairs, what did they do downstairs?

 

‘GUS: They were up here, they got past the door
man and the desk people how they got up the elevator rt
don't know.

_BUTCH; Were they in the basement?.

GUS: No, they headed towards the door that leads
to the basement but a guy said "Where are you going?"

HENRY: They didn't know ‘the door to get out.
So they said we're looking for downstairs. So they're
laying for them now. The building manager wants to see
me. I'd cause a lot of trouble by giving their names..
Cause this guy can identify them, the guy that saw them,
He said I knew they were phonys so I followed them. He
said they stood at the crossing see, and made out like
they were going to another building, then they walked to
the corner, He said I knew they were up to something.

EDDIE: I'm trying to understand it.
HENRY: They must have had a new.....

GUS: They wanted to bug this apartment, I think
to bug that particular apartment to find out what you talk
about.

HENRY: Oh hell yes they got to. But they don't
‘have to go through the door to bug it. 00k up stairs, they
may have a guy up stairs, So all right what have they ‘got
after that?
