COHN learned from GRANELLO's close ‘friends that
it was their feeling that the latter was "hit" because he
was making too many inquiries seeking the identity of the
assailants of his son MICHAEL. COHN feels that LEVINE might
know more about what was going on but that he would never

‘divulge this information to the FBI. COHN feels that LEVINE

would confide in him and whatever information he receives,

he would make available to the NYO. COHN said‘that at

this point he does not represent LEVINE, but that the latter
wants him to represent him-in his pending WPPDA matters.

COHN said he has made no decision in this respect. COHN
indicated that his motives for cooperating with this Bureau
was that he became quite friendly with GRANELLO and abhorred
his violent death. He said that he had been contacted by the
NYCPD, but that he would rather provide this information to
the Bureau. COHN was told that the NYCPD had primary juris-
diction in the murder and that the Bureau was cooperating
with the PD and was disseminating all pertinent information.
He voiced no objections to disseminating information to the
PD that he might provide. COHN indicated that he would be -in
touch with the NYO, FBI, in the event any pertinent infor-
mation comes to his attention.

It should be noted that ROY COHN requested that his
identity be kept concealed, therefore, the results of the
interview with him is being reported on the administrative
page. . .
