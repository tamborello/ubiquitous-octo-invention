It is noted that information furnished by rad
TOSDADO, U. S. Customs, Li Arizona, on March 2 1968,

go NYS“H8s0C ration ‘and rece with BALTASAR
ARROYO is completely at variance with that furnished by Miami
Agents, and also at variance wi ‘that information furnished
in signed statement by BALTASAR RROYOC H(i .

It is known to the Miami Office that CESAR DIOSDADO
: was transferred several years ago to Key West, Florida, from
7 Laredo, Texas, as a disciplinary measure after DIOSDADO per-
jured himself in U. S. District Court at Laredo. Because of
this, and his generally bad reputation among all. law enforce-
ment officers in the Key West area, it is not felt that creden
should be given to statements made by DIOSDADO (L(y)

oy, The Miami Office does not recommend Bureau's making
protest to U. S. Customs regarding DIOSDADO's failure to
furnish the complete facts of this matter to the Miami Office.
Customs appears also to have had problems in the past with
DIOSDADO, and it is believed that his transfer to San Luis
was for the purpose of rectifying an embarrassing situation
for Customs. Because of this, it is not felt that a protest
at this time would serve any useful purpose (i

One copy of this communication is being furnished |

ge \ airtel to Miami and Phoenix, 3/5/68, ‘

On March 26, 1968 CESAR DIOSDADO, U. S. Customs,
San Luis, Arizona, furnished the following information
concerning .BALTASAR ARROYO :/¥)(u .
Aa es : |
DIOSDADO denied that ARROYO was a long-time source
hs of his, but stated that he has known about ARROYO since 1957; N
w that in the normal course of his business to detect illegal | \
N smuggling of arms to Cuba he picked out ARROYO as a prime
suspect and endeavored to make friends with him over a period
Y of several years. (Yul

DIOSDADO stated that one MARIO MATO (now deceased)
and BALTASAR ARROYO were meeting all the boats and planes
between Cuba and the United States, It was DIOSDADO’s opinion
that they were the link between Cuban and U. S, sources in
the smuggling business from the U. S, to Cuba Yu

DIOSDADO stated that he does not believe that
ARROYO can be trusted; that the opportunity for a working
relationship with ARROYO did not present itself until the
latter came to him in September, 1967 as he remembers; ARROYO
stated that HORACIO VELIZ PEREZ had contacted him as an .
agent for the Cuban Government. When asked why ARROYO came
to him, DIOSDADO, in this matter instead of to the FBI,
DIOSDADO. stated that he doesn't know, except that ARROYO
would have known that he, DIOSDADO, was an officer of the
Government of the United States and had been checking on

Cubg muggling activities for a number of years in the(¢(ul

Key West area, When “Was suggested to DIOSDADO that ARROYO
may have suspected him sfbeing connected with CIA, DIOSDADO
became obviously coy about this thought and changed the
subject immediately Sa

DIOSDADO stated that when ARROYO first told him
about his contacts with VELIZ PEREZ he felt that ARROYO was
"playing both sides of the fence," trying to determine for
himself whether the United States or Cuba_had.him under
surveillance, DIOSDADO advised that he immediately’ brought
ARROYO and VELIZ PEREZ to the attention of Special Agents of
the FBI in view of the Cuban Intelligence aspect of the
presence of VELIZ PEREZ and ARROYO in Key West. DIOSDADO
premised this statement on the assertion that ARROYO was a
prime suspect in the smuggling of arms to Cuba, and at the
same time ARROYO was endeavoring to stay in good graces with
United States authorities K/w|

Concerning the background of the ARROYO and VELIZ
PEREZ relationship, DIOSDADO stated that he knew very little;
that according to ARROYO, VELIZ PEREZ, a printer by trade,
came to the United States in about August, 1967 and immediately
made contact with ARROYO under ‘the instructions of the Cuban
Government. VELIZ PEREZ has some blood relationship with a
young woman by the name of GLORIA HACES, or HASES, or ACES,
who came to the United States in,1965, and operates a beauty
parlor in the Du Pont Plaza HO 1 in Miami. Reportedly a
contact of VELIZ PEREZ is a Misi HERRERA, the owner of a
small corner rigs qe Cul lst Street and the water front in

Key West, Florida, |

DIOSDADO was asked if he could furnish any
identification of GILBERTO BLANCO and RAFAEL GONZALES DUANY.
He answered in the negative and said they were not known to
him, DIOSDADO was adamant in his assertion that all the
information he had about ARROYO was furnished to Special
Agents of the Miami Office of the FBI prior to his transfer
from that area (M/U\
