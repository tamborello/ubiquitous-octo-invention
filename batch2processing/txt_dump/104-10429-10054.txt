at. 1700 hours on 22 November 1963. The source reported that the two passen-
gers “were gangsters" and that "the plane had just come from Dallas, via
Tijuana (where it was forced to land because of engine trouble) and’ Mexico
City. " 5/ This information was sent to the FBI on 23 December 1964 for
investigation. 6/ The FBI. responded on 31 December 1964 that Tijuana
would have been. an.unlikely place for a "forced landing" on a flight from-
Dallas to Havana.. Their office.was making no further inquiries in the

_ absence of additional details from CIA. They suggested that CIA conduct

an investigation in Tijuana. 7/ (Tijuana is almost the same distance from

Dallas flying West as Havana would be flying Southeast or Mexico City would

be flying South.) The Mexico Station had no investigativ e assets in the

Tijuana area. The information was a year old when received and much too

vague for retroactive checking of records. The untested source who had

provided the report died before he could be questioned for additional
tails.

listing of the Cubana Airlines flight delay from "6 p.m. until 11 p.m."
The writers of this report were probably trying to transpose the departure
time to the equivalent of Eastern time. Their information is dated 1
December 1963 which is probably a.mistaken reference to the cable which
is dated 30 November 1963, 2/ The Mexico Station file copy of this cable

REFERENCE: 1. What is the ‘total CIA information on the two flights
from Mexico City. to Havana?

2. What was done, at ‘the time to develop further information
_ on this matter?

3. Can further information be acquired on this matter now?

FINDINGS:

1. The Mexico Station records confirm only one flight from Mexico City
to Havana on 22 November 1963.. This was the regularly scheduled Cubana
Airlines flight. There were two reports of small aircraft flights (one
a twin engine flight to Mexico City connecting with Cubana for: onward
transportation to Havana of a mysterious passenger;. and the other a flight
allegedly from Dallas, Tijuana, and Mexico City to Havana with two "gang-
land" type passengers.) Beyond the original reports (from sources of
undetermined reliability) there was nothing in the Mexico Station records
to substantiate that these flights ‘occurred. ;

2. Facts substantiated by Mexico Station recordS: On 22 November 1963
a Cubana Airlines plane from Havana arrived at the Mexico City International
airport at 1620 hours (Mexico City time) and departed on a return flight to
Havana between 1940 and 2035 hours (Mexico City time) the same day. It was

-. on the ground in Mexico City about 4 hours which would be considered normal

for servicing for a turnaround flight carrying passengers both ways. This
information was obtained from sensitive reliable sources in the process of

_ routine operating procedures on 22 November 1963.

3.° Report.not substantiated by.Mexico Station records: On 30 November
1963 CIA Headquarters cabled Mexico City that a report had been received
that the 22 November 1963 Cubana departure had been delayed.five hours from

. 1700 to.2200 hours awaiting an important passenger who arrived at the Mexico

City airport in a private twin motor aircraft at 2130 hours Mexico time.
Passenger transferred directly. to Cubana plane without going through customs

_or immigration and travelled in pilot's cabin to Havana. 2/ This information

was passed to the Mexican officials on 2 December 1963 for investigation,

There is no record of a reply. We know from independent information in
paragraph two above that some parts of this report are in error. The Cubana
flight was not delayed for five hours. It had departed for Havana from Mexico
City between 1640 and 2035 hours which would be at least an hour before the
twin motor aircraft was alleged to have arrived in Mexico City. The source's
name is on the manifest as a passenger from Mexico City to Havana but the

time supplied by him does not agree with other information considered reliable.
