MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : ~HSCA Access to Mexico City History

1. HSCA requested access to some 200 pages of the
three -volume history of Mexico City - about a third of
the material.. Thé substantive content runs the gamut from
the history of Mexico University through-detailed operation-
al support capabilities and. high level political connect-
ions and activities. It is an impressive accumulation of
operational activity - classical sources and methods, as
well as detailed revelations about past events. :

; 2. We pointed out that the agreement between Chairman
Stokes and DDCI Carlucci directly faced the issue of the
irrelevancy of the vast majority of the history, and the’
sensitivity of it. The .HSCA position had been that it had
to verify this, and the access given to senior levels was
to satisfy this. Now it was being requested in connection
with depositions, which would serve to get this material
into a Committee. transcript. Since some two-thirds of the
station's history (the work covers 1947 through 1969) pre-.
ceded the visit of Oswald to Mexico in 1963 and assassination
of the President, that clearly had nothing to do with the
Committee's charter. JI added that Mr. Carlucci is out of
town, and will not’ be back until some time Sunday, so I
could not go back to him. The request was so far beyond the

z >, that I felt I could not modify it. Cornwell then.
chat I speak to the Director. — .

  
 

3. I saw the Director at about noon, and summarized
the agreement and the dilemma, also going over the above.
He stated that I could offer access to one senior staff
member (in addition to Blakey and Cornwell)on the condition
that material from the history not be used in depositions.

4. I spoke with Cornwell, giving him the message. He
said that they may wish to use some of the material. I
replied that the history is based on other sources; those
related to the portion that is within the Committee's charter

was based entirely on sources to which Committee investi-
_gator's have had access. . Our problem was the overall.
collection, and particularly some of the substance of the
‘history. He asked if he could come back and ask for it,
if they wanted to use something in particular. I said
that we had never closed a door completely, but that the
Director's condition was fairly clear. Those things
relevant to their authorized inquiry were already in
their hands, so I could not think what they would have

to use from this. They will ask us, and we can react ©
when they do. . : :
