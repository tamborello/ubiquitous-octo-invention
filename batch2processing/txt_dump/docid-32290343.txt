The petition enéloséed a’memorandum to the effect

of immigrating to Mexico and for that purpose “would. estab-

lish an account with a guarantged monthly income. in. Mexico
under Mexican Immigration law £ : ara

 

. It cited that on 8/23/66 GIANCANA requested ao
chaige of status from-tourist to immigrant and this peti-
tion was denied on 9/8/66, and he was ordered to leave the
country. 'It is alleged that this denial was based on the
.jintercession of the American FBI, who falsely accused GIANCANA™

which -has been subject to fierce persecution in recent years.

The memorandum continues:

1. It is true that Mr. GIANCANA was involved
in gambling activities in the United States in the
form of bets on horses (bookies). Nevertheless,

|sx: GIANCANA has not been involved in such activities

since 1950 and has remained outside of this activity
since that date AC y

2. Because of such activities in the past, Mr.
GIANCANA has been the object of a publicity mpaign,
against him largely instigated by the FBI alu

   

3. One of the reasons at this persecution
j\has increased in recent yea¥S” is because about four
‘years. ago Mr. GIANCANA backed a candidate for Chicago
City Council against a candidate proposed by the mayor,
and the candidate backed by GIANCANA, who was repre-
sentative of the Italian community in Chicago, .won. gl)

 

' 4, Since that time the FBI has initiated a cam-
paign of persecution and surveillance of Mr. GIANCANA
with the result that he finally had to seek an injuhnc-
tion from the Federal Judge in Chicago. The Judge
ordered the FBI to terminate their activities against
‘IMr. GIANCANA. The FBI appealed this judgment but it
‘was confirmed and the head of the FBI in Chicago was
fined $500. This action'infuriated the FBI which, in

spite of the judicial uy has continued to this
day its persecution :¢ i

Because of this the judge declared him.in con
of court and sentenced him to a year in jail,

Finally he was released
because no prosecutable offense was developed. gy

  

™~
Because of the foregoing, Mr. SAM GIANCANA desires

to remove himself from these harassments on the part

of the FBI and the newspapers and seeks refuge in

Mexico to live antranquil life without dedicating

himself to any financial or remunerative activity,

living solely from his investments, As is shown by

the foregoing there are no criminal charges against
‘Mr. GIANCANA and no legal grounds for his detention.

If there were, the FBI would apprehend him immediately

because they are constantly yware of his location
in the United States. y )

Source advised that he was personally acquainted
with subject's attorney, JORGE CASTILLO, and CASTILLO learned
that he had made inquiry in Cuernavaca concerning subject.

He believed this was through his contact with RUTH DORNBERG.

He had contacted RUTH DORNBE RG, but she claimed to have - 4
no knowledge of subject.

CASTILLO claimed that inquiry concerning subject
was not necessary and that he was willing to cooperate.

However, he did not furnish information as to subject's wl ; j
whereabouts, indicating only that subject was not in Mexico
