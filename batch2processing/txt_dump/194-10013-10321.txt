Source "A-VIII" revealed that Premier Otto Grotewohl received
a letter addressed to him at the Russian Embassy, Berlin (UU9220), East
Germany, postmarked 11 June 1957, from Mrs. aa, SUBJECT's mother,

who resides at eee ey Bargoed Glam, South Wales, Great Britain.
The letter stated as follows:

Bargoed Glam
South Wales, Great Britain
21 April 1957 ;

Dear Biry

Onoe again I am writing. to you, but this time I am sending
it back to Berlin with a person who is living there, but has been stay-
ing here for @ holiday. I thought perhaps you are more sure of getting
this letter if it was posted in Berlin than if it was posted here. Will
you please send my son back home to us. He is in Bautzen, Wall Str 4.
He is the only one we have, and we have not seen him since Xmas 1
Perhaps he is afraid to come back here, because he was in the British
Army. He may think that he will get punished, but that is not so. Please
send him back and please will you tell him that everything will ve al-
right if he comes home again. Please will you do this for hie father and
I because we want him home so much. He is all we have and we don't want
to lose hin.

Yours Faithfully

My son's name is . Wie address at present Bautzen Wall Str 4

PS Please will you send mé @ reply to the address on front of letter."
