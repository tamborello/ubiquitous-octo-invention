No steps are being taken by the Miami Office at this
time to develop DIAZ as a regular informant of this office, since
the information presently at his disposal did ‘not justify such >
measures. However, DIAZ has been contacted on several occasions
by the Miami Office on matters concerning which he may have Past. «
knowledge and during such contacts DIAZ has been most sincere and
co-operative.
