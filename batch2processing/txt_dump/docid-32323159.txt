DL-6-S on 12/16/64 furnished to SA EDWIN D. YY
KUYKENDALL a handwritten report dated 12/14/64. It is.

filed as 134-1A-875.

 

Informant advised J , GI Porun

member, Dallas, called JOE LANDIN/ Dallas, to invite

him to a GI Forum meeting. In tWeir conversation,

OROZCO told LANDIN he was planning to talk to the ;

Chief of Police, Dallas, to clear the GI Forum's name.

The Dallas COP had on television indicated that the GI

Forum and PASO were subversive organizations . This happened
shortly after President KENNEDY's assassination. Off and
on OROZCO meets potential Forum members who decline to

join that organization because ef the above mentioned

bad publicity.

Informant stated JOE MOLINA, a past member of
GI Forum, was questioned by the Dallas PD on the night
President KENNEDY was killed. MOLINA was described as a
subversive, by.tle Dallas Times Herald Television station,
and MOLINA has sued the newspaper. OROZCO told LANDIN,
FORUM's high officials.had not come to MOLINA's aid. ~
OROZCO had spoken toe BILL LOWERY and had been told that
LOWERY had not given MOLINA's name to the FBI. OROZCO
Said this apparently was true. Since the FBI has told
MOLINA that they had not given MOLINA's name to the police,
it was not known where the police obtained MOLINA's name.
OROZCO recalled that President KENNEDY was a great friend
of the GI Forum.

Informant had no additional information.
