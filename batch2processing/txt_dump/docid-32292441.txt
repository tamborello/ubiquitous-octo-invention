THE ABOVE INFORMATION CONCERNING TRUST AGREEMENTS,
ETC;,, IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE INASMUCH AS THE INFORMANT LEARNED
MOST OF THE INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE
TORNABENE FAMILY, AND EXTREME CARE SHOULD. BE USED IN THE
USE OF THIS INFORMATION,

TC-1, I rurnishea #1 the following
information on May 28, 1964, and June 4, 1964:

The following information concerning informant's
employment at 1150 North Lake Shore Drive as concerns PRIO
and ALEX should be kept in strictest confidence because
should the information be improperly disseminated it could
cause a hardship on the informant, so therefore, caution
should be used in.using any of the following information:

. Informant is the manager of the apartment building
at 1150 North Lake Shore Drive where AKEX resides and he
stated that in fiddle April, 1964, Chicago hoodlum ROSS PRIO
sought to rent an apartment in this building, He said that
PRIO somehow found out that he had.a furnished apartment avail-
able which fact was not common knowledge, Since he knog of
PRIO's reputation, he refused to accept PRIO's application
for an apartment, The informant is of the opinion that ALEX
was not aware of this and would not approve of PRIO's moving
in, because ALEX has always been very sensitive to any publicity
regarding him and hs residence which might alienate his
neighbors,

Informant feels that if ALEX wanted PRIO in the
apartment he would have said something in his behalf as ‘he
did for his paramour SUZANNE FUEGER, .Informant believes that
PRIO's contact with the apartment was BOB FARBER, who lives
in the same building as ALEX and PRIO frequents Al Farber's
Steak House,

Informant said that SUE FUEGER has always been a
very nice girl who tries to live modestly and was quite anxious
about the amount of rent she would have to pay when she moved
into the apartment, He said that she is attractive, pleasant
and makes a good impression,

Informant added that ALEX called him out of a
board meeting to.inquire as to whether or not SUE's application
was approved, When told that it was, he said "Thanks pal,"
ALEX had previously told the informant. that he would do any-
thing for him and asked him specifically if he needed any money,

. Informant stated ALEX recently had some bad publicity in the

NW 45679

newspapers and the informant was somewhat disturbed because
ALEX's address was given and this hurts him, He feels that
SUE might be an asset to the apartment and neighbors will not
be as curious if she is in the same building as it was before
when she was frequently visiting him and passing through the
lobby.

He said that ALEX has a brass plate over the lock
on his door and he, the PCI, has no key, He stated that ALEX's
apartment is the only one. in the building for which he has no

key, . He stated that he is also aware that ALEX has-a burglar
alarm on his front door also,
