in the internationally accepted sense (CocoM, Battle

__ covert pressures on the companies involved, as
distinguished from governments,
Progress has Leen made in our economic denial

‘program, and effective operations have been carried

 

out cooperatively by State, Treasury, Commerce and
CIA, There is, however, considerable additional
effort required, especially because Castro is now
engaged ina major’attempt to broaden trade with
the free-world, No new authority is required at
oe this time, but rather an intensification of efforts
through the Inter-Departmental Coordinating Con-
mittee on Cuba. a . |
- A nore restrictive legal interpretation by the
Executive Branch of the various legislative pro-
. visions on trade with Cuba could have considerable
impact, if we were prepared to accept the costs to
‘our other interests in the offending countries and
if we were prepared tacitly to indicate that existing

legal interpretations had been in error,

the conclusion of an agreement involving the amend- Ob
ment of NSAM 220 with the British shipowner Nevroteon}
to guarantee the withdrawal by early 1965 of all his
ships in return for the progressive removal from )
the blacklist of his vessels as they get out of

the trade. This agreement should have beneficial
effects on other important ship owners.

A selective refusal to exercise the Presidential
waiver of the Cuban shipping provisions of the new
Foreign Aid Authorization act could increase our
diplomatic pressures on the maritime nations, if
we were ready to incur the costs to our broad
interests in the offending countries.

D. Air Service to and from Cuba
Our efforts to reduce, restrict and harass

air services (free-world and Communist) to and from —

Cuba should be strengthened by the provisions of the

new Foreign Aid Authorization act, if, again, we

are prepared to accept the costs to other interests

— _ The basic Limiting factor in the intensification

of our political and economic pressure on other

countries bilaterally is, of course, the balance

that must be struck between our interests with respect:

. , : to Cuba and other broad interests at play in our
bilateral relations, For example, Spain's in-
creasing commercial and transportation relations

_with Cuba are a matter of concern in terms of our

Cuban policy, yet the political and economic

* pressure we can exert on Spain is circumscribed

, by the need to safeguard our other political and
military interests in Spain.

B. Economic Denial

-

This program involves overt and covert, legal

and extra-legal, diplomatic and private, efforts to
deny Cuba access to free-world markets and sources

. of supply for commodities critical or important to
the Cuban economy. A major inhibiting element in
this effort is the short world supply of sugar which
increases Cuban leverage on free-world sugar con-

sumers. In addition, there is a general (but varying)

reluctance on the part of frec-world countries to

Il. Bilateral .

A. General ,

- Essentially, the effort in the bilateral field
vould represent a continuation, sharpening ‘and

. intensification of programs already in effect.

Measures of a bilateral nature, outside and within

the Hemisphere, would be strengthened and facilitated
by OAS decisions and recommendations emerging from the
Venezuelan case, Wherever possible, the OAS reso-
lutions would request the cooperation of other

countries.
