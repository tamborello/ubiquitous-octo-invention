the Communist Party or subversive elements to infiltrate the racial .
movement; possible racial disturbances; advance planning of Martin Luther
King and his associates; deménstrations against Congressional committees,
et cetera. We also pick up information regarding Security Index subjects
which is included in investigative reports that eventually go to the
Department, as the Department passes on Security Index cases.

Our safeguards in the area of technical surveillances are

(a) careful evaluation before they are installed. Current instructions
are that they shall not be used in any case with prosegutive possibilities

(b) Paraphrasing or covering up of the source when we disseminate, so
that the recipients cannot determine that the source of the information
is a technical surveillance. .

(c) Should a case develon prosecutive possibilities, despite our efficrts
not to-use technical surveillances in any case which may develop int U
prosecution, we will insist on a complete understanding with the Depart-
ment and the US Attorney, so that we will not run into another case,
such as the JARO case, handled so ineptly by US Attorney Hoey.

4. MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCES
' Microphone surveillances are being employed in security cases (44)
and criminal intelligence matters (60). Each installation of a micro~
phone must be approved by Mr. Tolson's office.

We are presently going over each of these existing surveillances,

|i the security field, to insure that they are not being employed where

there are prosecutive possibilities, and the same precaution will be
used in future installations. The attached radiogram to the field

. $80 instructs the field.

Intelligence information coming from these security microphones
is likewise disseminated, when pertinent, to outside agencies, with
appropriate paraphrasing and coverup of the source so that the
recipients will not know the source. As in the case of technical
surveillances, valuable intelligence data is derived from these sources.

In the criminal intelligence field microphone surveillances
have been a primary source of information permitting us to gain knowledge
of the activities in the field of organized crime, and particularly -

Cosa Nostra. The information derived has enabled us to know of the
organization and planning of leaders of organized crime, and has pro-
vided data leading toward our primary goal of infiltrating, penetrating
and disrupting organized crime, and provided leads to develop live

_ informants within organized crime, Following the leak from the Depart-—
ment in the Las Vegas case we stopped disseminating to the Department
and the US Attorneys any information coming from our microphone surveil-
lances, and Since that policy was adopted we have had no further leaks
from these sources. The only dissemination we make is when we pick up
information about a possible forthcoming murder, or a matter within

the jurisdiction of local authorities. We then dissemgnate to carry

out our responsibilities, but we paraphrase and cover the source. iie
have had no difficulty in this regard. The attached radiogram to the
field reiterates instructions that information coming from these
criminal intelligence microphones must not be disseminated without
prior Bureau authority.

Xf approved, we will operate along the lines set forth above.

Technical surveillances are being used only in security-type
