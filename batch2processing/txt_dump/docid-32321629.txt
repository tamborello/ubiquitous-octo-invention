pursuant to the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) letter
requiring the FBI's response by 10/21/96. New Orleans is also
requested to send pertinent files to Headquarters/JFK Task Force as
soon as possible.

Details: The ARRB by letter dated 9/10/96 (copy available upon
request) has requested that the FBI identify all information in FBI
assassination records that the FBI believes is under court seal.
The ARRB's interest in this matter, is to have the Department of
Justice assist in petitioning the courts to unseal the records. so
the documents may be opened to the public.as established by the JFK
Assassination Records Collection Act (JFKARCA).

In accordance with the ARRB letter, the FBI must identify
which jurisdictions/judges placed these records under court seal.
In the case of electronic surveillance, the ARRB also seeks the
location and the duration of the surveillance. Because the
background information concerning these electronic surveillances
are maintained in -the Field Office, we are requesting that the
field do the research necessary to respond to the ARRB's request.
The ARRB seeks the following information:

1) the name and jurisdiction of A judge approving the

electronic ausvelliance, - b-HO-L0DIZ0S 3%:

2) any docket number or case name associated with the
information.

. 3) the location and duration of the electronic
‘surveillance.

4) the subject of the electronic surveillance.

Please furnish this information for each file/informant number
indicated at the end of this communication. This information may
be faxed into HO/UFK Task Force by secure fax (202)324-9471. This
information should be furnished to HQ by C.O.B. 10/11/96.

Pursuant to the JFKARCA any materials considered
assassination records must be made available to the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original form.
The JUFKARCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain
information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be
maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in full.
Therefore, the files will not be returned to your Field Office.
Since the originals will be sent to NARA, copies of the files
should be made for record purposes prior to their shipment to
Headquarters. All files should be received at Headquarters no
later than C.O.B. 10/11/96.

Below are the assassination records maintained in your
Field Office. Because the copies of the documents we are working
with were put together in 1978 in no real assemblage and many with
no identifying file numbers, we are furnishing you with the best
available information possible. If you have any questions, you may
contact Brian Fields (202)324-9535 or LuAnn Wilkins (202)324-9466.

Please ship the following files to FBIHQ, JFK Task Force,
Attention: Brian Fields, Room 6362. .
