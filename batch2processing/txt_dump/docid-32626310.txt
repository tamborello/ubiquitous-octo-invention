has never made clear to the Soviet Union a specific proposal which would
result in a freeze or a reduction in nuclear delivery forces. Therefore,

the very existence of a firm U.S. proposal would profoundly change the

existing situation and require a searching reappraisal by the Soviet

leadership.
The US View

Military Analysis

While this agreement would significantly alter existing US military
plans, its military advantages appear to out-weigh the disadvantages.
According to. present plans (SIOP-63 and future force projections) on
1 July 1965 the strategic power of the U.S. measured in initial. delivery

capability will be stabilized at approximately 4100 warheads and 9200
megatons. Therefore, despite appearances such an agreement will not_have

a major effect upon the size of U.S. strategic force.

or to a MLF, this would result in a relatively small decrease in U.S.
strategic forces but no net decrease in NATO strategic forces. The

major impact would be a freeze in the qualitative strategic arms

 

race. The current transition from manned forces such as the B-L7 and
B-52 to invulnerable missiles such as Minuteman and Polaris would be
halted. Nevertheless, by 1 July 1964, relatively large invulnerable

forces will be in operation. The following chart shows this transition.

Such an agreement would, of course, stop the deployment of any
pallistic missile defense system. At present we probably do not know
how to build a ballistic missile defense system with high-kill probabilities
against more than ten warheads each equipped with 10 heavy objects and

known penetration aids, due to

forces are adequate to "shield" the Socialist camp and that the present
nuclear balance is in the interests of the Commmist movement. It would
appear that this ideological position could be readily extended to cover
an agreement to freeze the present balance of forces. Certainly if the
Soviet Union takes the position that the present balance of forces has
changed to their advantage » they should not find it hard to argue that
freezing the present balance would be in the Soviet interest. In order to
increase the likelihood of Soviet acceptance if such an agreement were
worked out, we should indicate to the Soviet Union that we would be willing
to include in a separate commmique a statement that “at such time as all
militarily significant states have signed this treaty, the original
signatory powers egree that they shall econfer.to seek agreement to reduce
their military forces as a further step toward the common objective of
general and complete disarmament." This would put the responsibility for
disarmament failure on China and possibly France.

To date, the lack of any lengthy substantive Soviet discussion on

‘nuclear delivery vehicle limitations may be due to the fact that they

have no expectation whatever that the United States would agree to such
limitations at this time. The Soviet leadership, like the U.S. leadership,
must be very wary of proposing new agreements which are rejected, parti-
cularly if they include concessions. Last October at the U.N. Mr. Gromyko
indicated Soviet interest in cutting back strategic vehicles and this
spring Mr. Tsarapkin seid the Soviet Union would permit on-site inspections
as controls on an agreement to limit strategic delivery vehicles; but

neither statement evoked any apparent interest in the U.S. The US Government

the military balance of power which have remained relatively static, but

to a changed Soviet assessment of the value of the treaty in their dispute
with the Chinese. This proposal would have a number of political advantages
for the Soviet Union:

(1) It would increase pressure against diffusion, consolidating the
nuclear status of the USSR, U.S. and Britain, and probably further dividing
France from its NATO allies.

(2) It could save the Soviet Union billions of rubles.

(3) .It would seriously hinder the formlation of the MLF.

It would also have some disadvantages:

(1) It would permit Western inspection in the Soviet Union.

(2) It would guarantee continued U.S. nuclear superiority.

Despite these arguments, probably the principal incentive for the Soviet
leadership would be their assessment of the political utility of this proposal,
both in strengthening their hand within the Commmist movement and in dividing
the Western alliance.

If the Soviet Union could justify the treaty in terms of advancing
the cause of the International-Commmist Party and Soviet leadership,
this agreement might be viewed by Moscow as @ powerful. tool in strengthen-
ing their policy of peaceful coexistence. If not, this fact in itself
would probably be sufficient to cause the rejection of the proposal.
Evidence from the present Moscow-Peiping debate indicates that the
Soviet Union has already begun to defend the nuclear status quo as a Soviet
(not U.S.) advantage. (See Tab C.) In their August 20 reply to the CPR

government, the Soviet leadership clearly implied that Soviet strategic

The Soviet View

Military 4; is

This agreement has military advantages for the Soviet Union. If
implemented on a world-wide basis, it would close the doors of the nucleer
club, thereby strengthening the military position of the Soviet Union vis-a-
vis both the non-nuclear powers and the minor nuclear powers, Britain and
France. This agreement would, in effect, confirm Soviet military superiority
over all nations of the world except the United States.

On the other hand, it has the disadvantage that it would clearly freeze

US strategic superlority.

* Due to overseas bases and tankers U.S. medium-range bombers can attack
Soviet targets. Due to shortage of tankers very few Soviet medium-bombers
can hit targets in the United States, with the exception of Alaska. Soviet
TREMs, in present positions, cannot strike the US except in Alaska.

Clearly the Soviet Union would prefer not to accept a position of

strategic inferiority if they had an alternative. They do not. Now

that the United States Poleris and Minuteman programs are hitting a

production rate of better than a missile per day, it is very doubtful
that the Soviet leadership could believe that they have any reasonable
chance of obtaining parity with the United States. If this truth is

perceived by the Soviet leadership, then they have no choice but to

-eecept numerical inferiority which does not alter the qualitative

palance. Therefore, the determining factor in the Soviet view will
undoubtedly be, not the balance of thermonuclear power, but the
political impact of such an agreement within the Commmist and non-
Commmist world.

Another disadvantage would be the fact that the Soviet Union would
have to permit inspection. Clearly this would be odious to the Soviet
leadership. On the other hand, it need not represent an insuperable
obstacle. Khrushchev's test ban offer of three on-site inspections,
if made in good faith, would indicate that if the political benefits
of the agreement were high enough, the Soviet Union would allow in-
spection. In Western terms, adequate inspection for a production cut-off
could be achieved with relatively modest inspection, to-wit, permanent
parties at declared production plants plus a few on-site inspections of
suspicious plants. This inspection network which would be primarily in
fixed Locations showla be far more acceptable than the mobile inspections
that would be required for any agreement on force level reductions.
Political Analysis

The current Sino-Soviet dispute has brought and will probably continue
to bring about changes in Soviet political assessments. The recent Soviet
acceptance of the long-standing Western offer for a partial test ban treaty

was undoubtedly primarily due, not to economic pressures or any shift in

TOWARD A NEW DISARMAMENT STRATEGY

Introduction

Until recently general and complete disarmament and a nuclear test
ban were the keystone of U.S. disarmament policy. Our success in negotiat-
ing a limited test ban treaty has changed the situation, for Premier Khrush-
chev has made clear that he has withdrawn his offer of three on-site in-
spections and, therefore, a comprehensive test ban treaty is no longer a
major factor in future negotiations. Although the Soviets will undoubtedly
continue to use their proposals for general and complete disarmament as a
political weapon, Premier Khrushchev's recent private comments indicate no
interest whatever in destroying missiles. All of this indicates that in the
fall of 1963 we should consider shifting our disarmament strategy to new
ground.

Present proposals for general and complete disarmament are framed in
a political void which implies that all nations and weapons are created
equal. In our future policy we may wish to draw a greater distinction
between nuclear powers and non-nuclear powers and between nuclear weapons
and conventional weapons. It could recognize the fact that nations are not
equal -- that nuclear powers do have more power and, therefore, should have
greater influence and control in any international agreements. Finally, it
should come to grips with the issue of China and France.

Since the advent of atomic weapons in 1945, the control of nuclear
weapons on a world-wide basis has been one of the primary objectives of

U.S. national policy. There is no reason now to change our objectives.

The hot line, observation posts, end proposals to destroy B-k7's may be
worthwhile but they should not be allowed to distract our attention from
the primary issue, the control of nuclear weapons. The shift we should,
and to some degree have made, is to emphasize agreement among the nuclear
powers rather than an international agreement. While resulting conventions
should be open to signature by all nations, they should be negotiated and
inspected primarily by the nuclear powers. It is no accident that both
DeGaulle end Khrushchev have emphasized negotiations by nuclear powers
while China has called for a world-wide disarmament conference of all
nations. .

Therefore, we should be prepared to negotiate a strategic force
freeze without requiring concurrent reductions in conventional forces.
As ‘long as we can freeze the present strategic nuclear balance, then the
question of whether the Soviets have five or ten divisions » more or less,
in Central Asia is not a controlling factor. In any confrontation between
China and the United Stetes, the Chinese are less likely to use their local
conventional superiority in the face of our atomic superiority. This is
not to suggest that conventional force reductions on the part of the Soviet
Union or other nations are not desirable, but rather that they can and
should be anslyzed separately.

THE IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE OF U.S. POLICY COULD BE TO GAIN WORLD-WIDE

ACCEPTANCE OF LIMITATIONS ON INCREASES IN STRATEGIC FORCE LEVELS. THIS

. (
In broad outline, our strategy could be based on a two-phase
program, as follows:
Phase I - the nuclear powers agree to freeze strategic nuclear forces
at their existing levels, forbid the construction or deployment of anti-

pallistic missile systems, and stop the further production of atomic mater-

dals for military purposes under adequate inspection. They concurrently an-

nounce thet, when all the militarily significant states sign the treaty
which is open to all nations of the world, they will meet together to
negotiate reductions in their existing strategic force levels.

Phase II - Participation of all important nations will be sought in
the above treaty, including China and France.

In the Washington disarmament debate, there has been great dispute
between those who advocate the continuation of our present arms build-up
and those who advocate proposals to the Soviet Union to agree to sharply
cut back nuclear delivery systems and warhead stockpiles. Little or no
attention has been given to the possibility that the Soviet Union would be
willing to agree to freezing its nuclear forces at existing levels. To
be sure, such a position contradicts all Soviet disarmament statements,
‘but such an agreement might serve Soviet interests within the Commmnist
world and confirm what the Soviet Union may do regardless of agreement.
Such an agreement would advance the joint interest of the United States
and the Soviet Union against the minor or aspiring nuclear powers. Para~
doxically, a U. s. proposal for a cut-off of fissionable material and
cessation of production of arms has never been thoroughly studied or
staffed because Soviet approval was not expected since such a proposal
would be s0 obviously in the interest of the U.S.
