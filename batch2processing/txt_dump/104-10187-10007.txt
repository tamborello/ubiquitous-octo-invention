_ b, In the Soviet area the activities under this project have been
many and varicd, Examples of thls are: Stake out of a mecting be-

on the agitation of Aleksandr SIDOROV, Soviet Military Aitache and
known intelligence officer, following a Station provocation of him;

a stake out of a bowling alley popular with PBPRIME citizens and officials|
living in México to determine the extent of a Sovict intelligence officer's :
attempts to cultivate these Individuals; and LIMITED's radio dispatching,

1, BACKGROUND .

The LIEMPTY Project ts designed to collect operational infor-
mation on the LIMERICK installation and personncl, as well as targeis of
opportunity, through stationary and mobile photographie coverage, In additton,
the project provides the means for Investigating leads from both the above
noted coverages and other Station sources, It supporis other Station operations
through the renting of safchouses, providing and servicing post office Lox mail
drops, conducting countersurvelllances and pretext investigations and perfoc-

ming related tasks,
2, OPERATIONS

LIEMPTY provides the majority of photographs used by the
Station tn its CE operations against the LIMERICK target. In this phase of
the operation the LIEMPTY basehouses and photo truck produced approximately
140 rolis of operational photos In support of the Statlon's.CE program during
the reporting period, The Station considers the photo coverage of the
LIMERICK inszallation as essential tool in following the dally activities of the
personnel of that installation, including known and suspected intelligence
officers, and Individuals visiting the establishment,

Selected examples of the LIEMPTY contribution to the Station's
CE program and its support of other Station operations are as follows:

a. The support provided by the wo LIEMPTY cutouts,
Oliver G, SCANTLING and Raymond H, GERENDE, in the AMROD
operation was essential to this operation, Due to the long operational
experience of these agents In the Mexico City operational environment °
their aid in both the planning and executlon stages of the AMROD

CONTINUATION OF i :
DISPATCH : SECRET HMMA - 21993

 

The security wall recently ereeted to the height of 4.5 moters
around the perimeter of the LIMERICK instalation has reduced somewhat the
area of coverage of (iw LICALLA base, Certain interior arrangements have
been made, such as raising the floor of the operating rocm at LICALLA, whic
will allow continucd operation of the base. However, if some sort of vegetatiog
grows over the wire strands at the top of the fence, the view of the base will
be shut off completely and other arrangemcuis for photo coverage of the
LICALLA area of responsibility will have to be made,

4, EQUIPMENT
No new equipment was purchased during the reporting perlod
nor Is any such purchase presently planned, All assigned equipment functioned
normally during this period,

5. PERSONNEL

No change in personnel assignments, recruitments or termin-
ations was experienced during the reporcing persod, The performance of all
personnel in the project continued to be completely satisfactory during this
period, The suppert rendered by SCANTLING and GERENDE to the AMROD
operation deserves particular mention and their superlor performance tn that
operation was noted in paragraph 2a above,

In recognition of his conzinued good all round performance the
Station recently requested that GERENDE's coatract be amended to provide
for an Increase in annual salary from $US 5, 500 io $US 6,000, This raise Is
not only desired, t ls considered necessary to offset the continued inflationary}
tread of the Mexican economy,

6. TRAINING

As in the prevlous reporting period, no training other than
continued review of tradecratt principles was conducted during this pertod,
Photographic product continues to be reviewed daily and the action agents are
instructed as necessary in order to improve or correct thelr technique in
both the taking aad processing of this product,

7. PLANS

Since the Station considers that this project is operating at its
optimum size, it does nor plan to expand it at the present time, Efforts will
continue to refine and better utilize the existing operational mechantsom,
