Re Phila. airtel 6/2/64, enclosing FD 142,

By separate cover Phila. is forwarding one Western
Electric 500MR-3 telephone set. It has been ascertained that
a 500DR-3 Western Electric set is being installed in subject's
office, as described in referenced communique. The only
difference between the two sets is that the 500MR-3 has four
conductor wires which will enable the desired alteration of
this set.

It 1s requested that the 500MR-3 be altered so that
a mite, mate or similar microphone will be installed in the
network of this phone. . .

Arrangements are that the subject is to receive
telephone service 6/9/64. Accordingly, it is requested
that the altered set be returned to the Philadelphia Division
by 6/8/64, noting that the installation is not in Headquarters
City.

 

The above request is based on authorization requested
in referenced communication. If authorization is this matter
is not granted, it is still requested that this set be altered
as it is contemplated it will be used in a previously authorized
Bureau installation in the near future.
