DN 62-1494

In the case of EUTENEUVER we learn that she is
; probably the author of a letter, which is enlisting the
support of individuals for the MM organization. The last
two paragraphs of this letter are indicative of her
dedication to the aims and purposes of MM:

"As ‘we the people’, have no recourse through the
courts of the land, a national committee has been established

to conduct citizen's trials of the traitors responsible for
our situation.

"It is one of the responsibilities of this
organization to bring these traitors to justice. With
your help, our task will be easier. As America needs the
strength of all her patricts in the critical days ahead, I
hope to hear from you at your first: opportunity." -

In the case of WALKER. He was interviewed in
connection with the JOHN ROBERT HARRELL - FUGITIVE case,
(Bufile 42-157640). WALKER at first withheld information
from Bureau Agents and on second interview admitted that he
drove HARRELL and was with HARRELL in January, 1963. WALKER
could possibly be one of the leaders of MM in Denver area.

We feel that these three individuals should be
investigated to determine their dangerousness, and whether
they have violated or would violate any laws of U.S. Although
these individuals and the MM organization cannot be
categorized as followers of Comminist or SWP philosophy,
consideration should be given te their published aims and
objectives inimical to the welfare of the U.S.

However, in accordance with Bureau suggestions,
investigations of these three individuals under separate
case files will be discontinued.

Report of SA LEARNED should be classified "Con-
fidential." up until the beginning of active
investigation of MM, was an established source; however, now,
that MM is subject of active investigation this office is in
process of establishing [— __] either as a confidential

As[____] will no doubt be qualified in the future
as a confidential source or ‘— informant; information
received from him and included in rerep should receive

the same protection as that information we will receive
from him in the future.

 

| Bureau requested information as to extent and eo}
| results of investigation conducted as to units outside ea
1 of the Denver area. Investigation, to the present time,
fails to reflect any MM units outside the Denver area; however,
} investigation is still continuing. It is noted that
Philadelphia was requested to interview[_————ias OTHER 4
to his knowledge of MM activity in this area. It is our
opinion that when more information is obtained about in-

dividual members of MM, consideration will be given to seek
| Bureau authority to interview some of the members, in effort
to obtain further information about the MM.
