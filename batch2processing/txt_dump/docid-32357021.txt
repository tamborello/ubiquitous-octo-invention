RE OPERATION ALPHA 66

on July 6, 1962, SJ T-3 advised that he had met
ANTONIO VECGIANA and had been requested to join the leadership
of Alpha 66 in Puerto Rico. He stated that he was introduced
to VECIANA by JERONIMO ESTEVE. SJ T-3 stated that he asked
VECIANA if he had contacted the Consejo Revolucionario Cubano
or the U. S. Government about his plans. VECIANA told him
that he hadmt done so and then §J T-3 told him he was not
interested until VECIANA has obtained the approval of the :
Consejo or the U. S Government. SJ T-3 stated that he considers
Alpha 66 to be another of the many hopeful Cuban exile opera-
tions which do not have a chance of success from the start.
SJ T-3 added that he would not donate a penny to Alpha 66
and considers it a posstble fraud. ; oO

On July 25, 1962, ROBERTO ROCA ROSILLO, youthful
Cuban exile leader in Puerto Rico of the Movimiento Revolu-
cionario Recuperacion (MRR), advised that he feels that
Alpha 66 is a group with high plans but without any chance
of success. He stated that Alpha 66's plans are not even
in shape to carry out any action before August, 1962, let
alone July, 1962 as Alpha 66 is still looking for guns and
men. ROCA stated that to do the. things Alpha 66 plans to
do would end up in suicide for all concerned. ROCA continued
that he certainly would not lend any of his MRR members to ;
Alpha'smovement nor would he donate any money to their cause.

on July 27, 1962, SJ T-4 advised that he has
heard of Alpha 66, but has mt paid much attention to it as
he considers it one of the many hopeful plans of the Cuban
exiles based on. emotions rather than “common sense. SJ T-4
stated that he ‘has not heard much of Alpha 66 in the past
few weeks.

A characterization of the Puerto. Rican
Statehood Party appears in the appendix
hereto.

"RE. OPERATION ALPHA 66

 

4s now referred to as Alpha 66. SJ T-2 does not know the
identities of the other leaders of Alpha 66, with the exceps-
tion of the figureheads in Puerto Rico, ;

These figureheads, who have nothin:; to say with
the operational plans of Alpha. 66, are as followss-

1) ISRAEL GONZALEZ, Certified Public Accountant,
employed Banco de San Juan, Santurce, Puerto Rico;
head of the local Cuban exile group known as the
-Contadores. Publicos en Exilio (Public Accountants
in Exile).

2) ROBERTO I, CASTELLON, a public accountant and
formerly head of the Triple AAA Cuban exile group;
and — ;

3) L, CEBALLOS, another Cuban exile whose background
is now known to SJ T-2.

SJ T-2 stated that he was asked to join the Alpha
66 leadership by VECIANA, but declined to do so stating
to VECIANA that while he was interested in helping any legi-
timate Cuban exile group, he does not plan to get involved
as an officer in any such. group of action such as. Alpha 66.
However, SJ T-2 stated that he would be willing to act as one
of four selected Cuban exiles in Puerto Rico who would jointly
endorse any checks or other donations to Alpna 66 to insure
that the money obtained would. be used for the stated purpose
of Alpha 66; that is, to pay for the cost of sending 66 men
into Cuba to commit five (5) actions against the Cuban
CASTRO Government. SJ T-2 stated that he does not know what
these five actions are with the exception of two, namely,
to blow up the Esso Refinery at Regla,. Cuba and to kill a
high Cuban Government official. .

SJ T-2 stated that all these actions of Alpha 66.
are to start from outside the United States and United States
territories. He does not know the location of any base of opera-
tions.

SJ T-2 continued that JERONIMO ESTEVi ABRIL, the
- aforementioned ROBERTO I, CASTELLON, an exiled Cuban priest,
Padre LEON HERNANDEZ and one DEL VALLE (not further described),
check all donations and issue receipts. If Alpha 66 is not :
successful in its plans, then the donations will be returned

to the donor. The money is banked in the Alpha 66 account _
“at the Banco de Ponce in San Juan, then ISRAEL GONZALEZ.
sends the money on to Miami where another account exists
in the name of Alpha 66; identity of bank in Miami is unknown

to SJ T-2.

' gy [~-2 noted that he had originally been introduced
to VECIANA by ISRAEL GONZALEZ. He then listened to the plans
of VECIANA, whom he hadace met through the Christian :
Family Movement some years. previous in Guba. SJ T-2 stated
that he was impressed with the apparent sincerity of VECIANA
and even went to Ponce, Puerto Rico to speak in behalf

of the Alpha 66

SJ T-2 stated that he has. not pressed VECIANA
for details as he feels tlt the less Cubans who know about
: theoperations of the group, the better chances are for some
_- success. He stated tht he feels tht the failure of the
landing at the Bay of Pigs was due to too many people knowing
about the plans before the attack. SJ T-2 fsels that VECIANA
realizes this also, and is attempting to keep the bare minimum

of people knowing about Alpha 66 plans.

; SJ T-2 stated. that the Division of Intelligence,

- police of Puerto Rico (DI, POPR) have contacted Cuban exile
leaders regarding Alpha 56, He stated that the detectives
apparently we had some complaints from other Cuban exiles

= Alpha 56 as ‘just another fraud. to obtain money

wee

The following information was furnished on a confi-
- dential basis on July 12, 1962 by SJ T-1:
2 — Ye

Ke ar Operation Alpha 66 is under the leadership’ of one
...~“ ANTONIO VECIANA BLANCH, an exiled Cuban certified public
: accountant who was formerly the president of the Certified
Public Accountant Association in Havana, Cuba, VECIANA
went into voluntary exile around December, 1961; arriving
in Florida by means of a small boat from Cuba. VECIANA
left Puerto Rico around July 5, 1962 en route to Chicago
and New York City to collect funds to carry out the A
66 plans of action inside Cuba. =

MICROFILMED -

SJ T-1 stated that VECIANA is the only sp9k smaniyc 24 196
for Alpha 66 in Puerto Rico, but he is supposed to have 1959
three or four other associates in Miami. These frien OC. MICRO. SER. |
not further identified, are supposedly exile Cuban leaders
in the Miami area.

He stated that Alpha 66.has no leader as such,
VECIANA has attempted to impress the Cuban exiles that
his movement is one of action to free Cubaa soon’as possible
and not an organization to seek membership andsit back
and wait. for the United States to free Cuba.

_VECIANA told SJ T-l that the United States Govern-
ment has proven by its past actions that it does not
intend to liberate Cuba in the near future. He bases this
belief on the followin: .

1) The U. S. permitted CASTRO to take over Cuba,

2) The U, S. permitted CASTRO to confiscate property
owned by U. Se citizens in Cuba without any action.

'3) The U.S. sat by and let CASTRO's Government
shoot American citizens without any protest. .

- 4) The U. S. has permitted Russia to set up a base

put feels that the Cubans cannot wait and depend on the
United States to fight their battles.

: Accordingly, .VECIANA has set up Alpha 66, a plan _.
to send 66 trained men of action into Cuba. and commit five (5)
violent, separate actions against the CASTRO regime. The five .

; If the aforementioned actions. are successful, then
Alpha 66 plans to sink a Greek or Canadian merchant ship ;
by using a fast yacht armed with pazookas. : So

Names given to these aforementioned actions are

The first action, one of the above, is to be carried
out at the end of July; the next two in August; and the last
two by September22, 1962. SJ.T-1 does not know which .actions .
are to take place first, second, etc.

: ; The target:completion, date of September 22, 1962
has been set by VECIANA.

VECIANA has been contacting the Cuban exile groups
in Puerto Rico, Florida, Chicago and possibly New york
City in order to collect $64,000 cash to carry out the plans
of Alpha 66. As of July 3, 1962 he had collected only $10,089.

-O-

 
RE OPERATION ALPHA 66

22, 1962, then Alpha 65 has pledged tla it will return all
-gonations to the donors.

- Tf none of the actions are successful by September }

The money is being cclilected and y:laced in the Alpha
66 account at the Banco de Ponce, Santurce, Suerto Rico...
All donators are. given receipts for money donated. The money
is set aside to cover each of the five actions. .

SJ T-1 noted tiat one of the larger donations,
one of $500, came from LUIS FERRE, Puerto Rican Statehood
Party leader. SJ jT~1 noted that FERRE has a reputation of _
always. donating to any anti-GASTRO drive, without reservations.

SJ T-1 stated that VECIANA has indicated to him

the names of thee individuals who are now in Cuba who are

. expected to assist Alpna 66 in their plan of action.. They

— are VINCENTE NOBLE, ,GUILLERM I[Z and BERNARDO PARADELA.

_ SJ T-1 noted that he ae ae as they had been connected

in 1956 with the Servicio de Inteligencia Militar (SIM)
in the Dominican Republic. According to VECIANA, .PARADELA is
in jail in Cuba. and SJ T-1 cannot figure out how he can be
of much help. However, NOBLE and RUIZ are on the loose in
Cuba and, according to 3J T-1, are cold-biooded killers.

SJ T-2aivised on July 12, 1962 that ANTONIO
VECIANA was formerly the Chief.of Action of the Movimiento
Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP) in the Havana area. He was
a-member of the Christian Family Movement in Cuba and President
of the Certified Public Accountant Association in Cuba. .He was
a top executive of the Banco Financiero, Havana, Cuba, which
bank was owned by JULIO LOBO; the "Cuban Sugar King". :

According to SJ T-2, VECIANA was in charge of the’
MRP plan "Liborrio" to kill FIDEL CASTRO. VECIANA's mother
had rented an apartment across the street from CASTRO!S
presidential palace in Havana, and VECIANA and friends set
up bazookas to fire at CASTRO. However, wen it came time
for action, the bazookas were found: to be defective and would
not fire. Then someone talked and VECIANA fled Cuba around
the latter part of 1961 by a small boat to Florida.

When VECIANA arrived in Florida, he contacted

other Cuban underground leaders he had known in Cuba who were
now in exile and togetuer they had. decided on forming what
