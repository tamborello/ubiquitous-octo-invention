CG 6343- n 11/10/60, wherein an individual believed
to be Vad IANCANA discussed thetStandard Garbage Disposal.
Company and“ thé difficulties this company had been encountering
with the Garbage Disposal Association. Apparently the
association had been utilizing pressure in order to stop
the Standard Disposal Company from expanding their business,
It was MURRAY;HUMPHREYS contention that an Antitrust suit
- should be filed against the Disposal Association and go

| through legitimate channels to exert pressure against the +
association rather than using muscling tactics. Th} cA

Dun and Brad Street Inc., report dated 5/2/60,

reveals that the Standard Disposal and Metal Company,
Inc., formerly at 55 East 18th Street, Chicago, had moved
to 1216 South Sangamon. Its officers were listed as ;
BERNARD L,, }SAMPSON and WALTER-BQEBENBERG, secretary and oy
treasiirér.” An analysis“#éfIects that this business had Ye
just started and financial details were lacking. LOEBENBERG
operated the Standard Coffee Service, Inc., at 55 East 18th
Street and according to this report was at that time still

active in that business. /){ | REC- 42 2 3 _

CG 92-349

CG 6283-C advised on 1/4/61, that the Standard
Disposal and Metal Company is a odlum controlled operation.
The informant stated that LENN ICK (Chicago top
hoodlum) and DAVEGYARAS (Known to Yami Office) are FIA.
working together arranging and lining up stops and customers
for this disposal company. Informant said that he knew for
a fact that PATRICK had approached the owner of Marty's
Food Mart, Inc., to line up this individual as a customer
for Standard Disposal Company. It was the same person who
was the victim of LENNIE PATRICK's muscling tactics ina ‘
shake-down of super markets in 1958. Ww

On 1/5/61, SAs RALPH R, HILL and VINCENT L. INSERRA
interviewed DAV YE who identified himself as the sales
director and vice president of the Standard Disposal and
Metal Company at 1216 South Sangamon. KAYE was interviewed
in his office at that address. KAYE was visibly disturbed
over the presence of agents and commented immediately to

the agents that he is a parolee from the State of Florida

and had been convicted of attempted murder:.in Miami in if
1954, however, would not go into lengthy detail as to A
circumstances surrounding his conviction other then to

state that he was sent to Miami from Chicago in 1951 by
EUGENE "JIMMY'YJAMES, the then vice president of the
{nHtéernational Latndry“Workers Union and head of: Local 46 in
Chicago. KAYE was sent to Miami as deputy receiver and
organizer in an.attempt to organize the Laundry Workers

in the south Florida area. KAYE advised that his Florida
penitentiary number was 53473 and that he was paroled

from the Florida Penitentiary on March 24, 1959, and his
parole was sponsored by EUGENE JAMES. KAYE stated he .
received a 20 years sentence and his parole expires in 1975(,)

   
  
 

qk

KAYE said that the Standard Disposal and Metal
Company was organized about a year ago and now has 175 to
180 stops, both residential and industrial, picking up
garbage and scrap. He said that they have been in difficulty
with the Salvage Association which has,according to KAYE,
‘formed a monolopy for restraint of trade” and that the
association is attempting to put them out of business by
closing them out of dumping grounds, pressuring trucking
companies to keep them‘from purchasing trucks and using

economic pressure on their potential customers. KAYE
insisted that the business has been obtained by underselling
competition, that this is drictly legitimate and that no
muscling tactics are utilized. He said that he knows DAVE
YARAS "slightly" but denied knowing LENNIE PATRICK. He stated
that neither YARAS nor PATRICK are at this time working for
this company and to the best of his knowledge have never

been utilized as salesmen for the Standard Disposal { i{ ))

| He said the operations of the Standard Disposal

{ Company are financed by the Guaranteed Trust and Savings.

| It is noted that the Guaranteed Trust was formerly the

; Southmoor Bank and Trust, whose president was LEON MARCUS,

| slain in gangland style in 1956, after which much speculation
[ was made to the effect.that the killing was carried out under
| orders of GIANCANA.{ Ul) ,

On 1/5/61, GIANCANA was observed at the Armory

Loun: in the evening, hours in company with NICK/’ANLTCO,
JOHN }FARELLT , and JO RKS. GIANCANA was obsefve

eing dropped at € Arm Lounge from a car occupied by
GIANCANA and two other individuals. This automobile after
dropping GIANCANA proceeded to 915 Franklin Street in

iver Forect where it was observed that

CARDO departed from this vehicle and proceeded into his
Pesitiéfice ‘at that address. ( \)

CG 6428-C advised that GUS' Steak House in Cicero,
_ mentioned previously, utilizes gambling on the second floor
i and that the whole layout is operated by FRAN RKEY, an
ex-convict. SHARKEY is probably FRANK "Sharkey ’
1104 South Maple, Oak Park, Illinois, a known clos@ associate
of GIANCANA's. (%
