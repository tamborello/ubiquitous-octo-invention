At 5:40 p.m. 1-6-61 Assistant AG Yeagléy called stating he
wanted to bring us up to date on developments in this case faqllowing
his conversation with the Director yesterday. . .

Yeagley said that he had talked: to Thomas Mann of the State
Department last night. Mann talked to Acting Secretary of State
Merchant. State's positjon was that they still thought it would be
[helpful to their situation if Masferrer's activities were stopped.
Therefore, State had no objection to the Department of Justice present-
ing the m atter to a grand jury. Yeagley told Mann that Justice was
not anxious to go ahead and would want a request in writing from the
State Department that to go ahead would be in the national interest.
Yeagley said he had sent a note over to the State Department today
along this line but he thinks that State Department is cooling off“and
he doubts that State Department will send over any request this ‘Week-
end, . ; ;

Yeagley said that he had attorneys from the Department of
Justice down in Miami but at this point they do not have authority to
call a grand jury nor to talk to witnesses. They are not, to see the
U.S. Attorney and they are not to let their presence be known in Miami
except to our office. . :
