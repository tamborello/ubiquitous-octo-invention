MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security
SUBJECT : Roselli/Maheu Matter |

1. This memorandum is for your information.

2. Reference is made to the 21 May 1975 memorandum from
Mr. Scott D. Breckinridge, which outlines his review of the
Department of Justice files on the Roselli/Maheu matter.

_. 3. The undersigned reviewed referenced memorandum and
discovered an apparent discrepancy between the Office of
Security files and the Department of Justice files. Para-
graphs 9 and 10 of referenced memorandum reflect that the
Department of Justice records contain a 22 May 1961 report
of an FBI interview with Colonel Sheffield Edwards. During
this FBI interview, Colonel Edwards allegedly stated that
"only Mr. Bissell and two others in CIA" were aware of the
"Giancana-Maheu activity" and that "Allen Dulles was com-
pletely unaware of Edwards’ (sic) contact with Maheu in this
connection."

4. Office of Security files reflect that Mr. Allen
Dulles had approved the entire operation against Castro, thus
inferring that he would have been aware of plans to approach
Robert A. Maheu, et al. Further, our files reflect that six
Agency people were aware of the operation--Allen Dulles,
William Harvey, Richard Bissell, Sheffield Edwards, Colonel
J.C, King, and James O'Connell.

5. The above is provided for your information should
this discrepancy surface during the current inquiries into
this matter.
