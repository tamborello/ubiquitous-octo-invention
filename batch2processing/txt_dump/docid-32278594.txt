"I am pointing it out in this connection because I
feel sure that further such actions are going to _
follow. I remember that, for instance, Treskow told
me who, incidentally, spoke a gocd German, that Hitler
had been a great teacher, namely to create pnrest as
in Czecho-Slovakia, Austria and Poland, to g about
dissatisfaction. And that is what we want. Yu)

"J am taking precautions so that, if events similar
to those that came about in America were to happen:
again, I shall be ab to say that I have already
uttered a warning. wy

The Girv|evbsoaventiy advised that it had caused a
search to be mad@ of the records of the West German Ministry
of Justice and could locate only two letters written by BUSKE

to that Ministry these being dated September 10, 1963, and i
December 12, 1963, Both contained general statements to the i
effect that BUSKE had valuable information and requested an
opportunity to present it. Neither of these letters made any
reference to the assassination of President KENNEDY in any context,

The Bundeskrininalamt ~ (BKA - West German Federal
Criminal Police) informed that it had arranged to have BUSKE
interviewed with regard to his alleged information possibly
bearing on the assassination of President KENNEDY. The BKA
furnished a statement dated at Stade, Germany, July 31, 1964, {
and signed by BUSKE and witnessed by Kriminalkommissar 'KOLLECKER.
The text of this statement in translation from the German is
