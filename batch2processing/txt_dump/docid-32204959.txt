that you never heard of any attempt at assasination plots—
that might be planned by the CIA iff any were planned?

MR. CLIFFORD: No, at no time. “We had something
of a joke on the Boatd. Ambassador Robert Murphy, for whom
we all had the greatest respect and a great fondness,
wondered why the CIA could not do in Ho Chi Minh. He did not
think it would be too difficult a task,.and every now and then
he brought it up and said, I can't understand why that can't

be done, but it was something of a humorous bit after awhile,

no serious occasion did the Board very suggest action of that
kind, nor were we ever informed that any effort of that kind
was. made, norvwas it even being considered,

When the teams were sent to Cuba over a period of
some!:two years and were rolled up, their function was not to
commit any assasinations. Their functions were tormake an
effort to establish an intelligence base in Cuba that would
be effective and help us to know what was going on in Cuba,
being only 901;miles from our shore.

MR. BELIN: ‘But you indicated earlier that sometimes
in the intelligence community that the people who were-super-
vising know what the people who are being supervised tell
them. Is that a fair ‘characterization of what your earlier

statement was?

MR. CLIFFORD: I think so. I think we knew then that

that our efforts did not produce much. ‘I left the Foreign

MR. BELIN: That was to become Secretary of Defense?
MR. CLIFFORD: Yes. And there in the Pentagon r had
some contact with the intelligence community, not too much.
That is handled mainly by the Deputy Secretary of Defense. He
gets the daily briefings and then sifts them through and
informs the Secretary of those items that are of immediate
‘moment. I did set a meeting a week with a representative of
the CIA and he came over, we had a set time, Thursday mornings
at 10:00 o'clock, and he came over and we kept that every time
I was in town, and I got an hours briefing, so that I kept .
‘up closely with that. I felt that was reasonably valuable.

We were not getting good intelligence from Vietnam.

President Rennedy::was concerned about Cuba. We wondered
whether or not there might be something going on between

Cuba and the Soviet Union as later did. And I guess, I think
I can remember six or seven teams who were wonderfully well
trained and sent to Cuba at various times, landed at various
locations, and every one of those teams were rolled up. Not:

one of them endured. And the reason is that Castro set up an

province, he has a deputy, and under that man in each town or’
each city or hamlet there is another top man and then in each

block there is a man, or in each precinct, and then in each

quod “a GTWYES FHL WONT AdODOLOHAa

block, and if the block isa large block, even down to two
or three sections, and their main job is intelligence.

It exists in the towns, it exists out in the country,
and ifa stranger puts ‘his face in Cuba today, in twenty-four
hours I think this person is apprehended and he is brought in
for interrogation. .

So, we have to find other means and other means were

found. You will remember that Cuban-U.S. confrontation '.that

came later, and the presence of the Soviet offensive missiles

in Cuba being discovered by our satellite type intelligence.

We photographed ships at sea with devices on their deck, very

great contributions to that. We had two very fine men, Dr.
William Baker of the Bell Laboratories, and Dr. Ben Lamb

of Polaroid. They worked very closely, and the Board

encouraged them, got all the money from the President that they

needed. We improved that a lot. We also got a great deal of

 
 
 

information in what is known as SIGINT, COMINT, ELINT and
RADINT -- signal intelligence, communications intelligence,
electronics intelligence and radar intelligence. The NSA has.
spotters all through the world and they pick up all of the
radio signals that go out, and when the Soviets launch a

test missile we follow it from its inception, we follow its
whole flight, we determine whether it was successful or not.

the next eight. years of President Eisenhower's Administration.

 

There were some strengthening acts, as far as unification
were concerned, under President Eisenhower which I think were
exceedingly desirable. I do not know of any legislative

action during those eight years regarding the intelligence

 
   
 

Then my next relationship to this subject came in

the spring of.1961. President Kennedy was then President,

at once. It was just after the Bay of Pigs, and in all of
the years I had known him I had never seen}shim as serious as
he was on that occasion. The substance of his comment was

that he had just had a major disaster and he said that the

“W GIWaaS FHL NOU AdODOLOHa

reason for the Bay of Pigs being such a catastrophe was one,

Od

he said -- and this is in effect -- I made the wrong decision;
two, I made it because I had the wrong advice; three, I got
the wrong advice because the facts upon which the advice was
based were wrong; and the facts were wrong because our

intelligence was faulty.

He indicated . that he had been informed that as soon
as the invading group reached the shores of Cuba that the
people would rise up against Castro, they would be down on the
beaches tossing roses at our men, and then they would el
triumphantly march through the streets of Havanna. Well, it -

was a real tragedy, and he said that’ I cannot endure another
