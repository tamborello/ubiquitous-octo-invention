Talking Points for meeting with ARRB Executive Director,
Laura Denk ‘ :

Meeting is primary a “Meet and Greet”

Laura will be looking for reaffirming of commitment to
complete the tasks still outstanding and to meet the
deadline for the final declaration.

Current Status:
Sequestered Collection

The re-review is virtually complete-- the remaining material
(approximate two boxes) is mostly security files)

(Note: In the review controversial, complicated or Denied
in Full documents were white-banded for later processing; I
currently have a team of 3 reviewers going through the
collection handling these problem documents. A number of
these could lead to potential appeal issues. It will take
2-3 weeks to complete the white band review.]

Russ Holmes' file

Review -- approximately 2/3 completed

Indexing -- approximately 1/2 completed
Special Requests

Complete -- 22

Continuing -- 10 (searches complete;

material being
collected or
available for review)
Outstanding -- 5 All DO

[Note: Two of the outstanding requests (CIA 16 and CIA-IR-
04) are long-overdue priorities that the ARRB staff
requested by completed by 7 August. Laura may raise this
issue. Several of the “Continuing” requests are close to
completion. ]

Other Topics for Discussion

Final Declaration -- “Who signs” may come up.

Transfer of Oswald classified files to NARA by 30 Sept.
Transfer of all Release In Full documents to NARA by 30
Sept.

[Laura changed procedures -- we no longer have to send
through ARRB staff; send directly to NARA.]

Next Meeting - 25 Aug.- Possible Issues

Mexico City Tapes (200+)

Board leaving toward declaring as Assassination Records;
DO's initial response is to object. I have advised DO that
we will need a “defense” for Aug. 25 meeting.

IFDECANTER

Although the release of DECANTER was delayed at last
meeting, I understand the Board still leans toward release.
