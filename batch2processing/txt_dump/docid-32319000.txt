case file) are in fact exact copies of documents previously
released by the Bureau under FOIA. This would eliminate the need
for NARA to print out two copies of the identification forms and
relieve the Bureau of reviewing more than 20,000 identification
forms.

I am very interested in obtaining as soon as possible the Bureau's
certification in writing that the case files (except for the second
version of the Jack Ruby case file) are disclosable because they
are exact copies of material the FBI previously released to the |
public under FOIA. Please advise me when I might expect a décision-
from the Bureau. We plan to commence delivery of completed
identification forms on Friday, June 11, 1993. However, receipt of
the above mentioned written certification would obviate this.

 

I should note that this proposed arrangement applies only to FBI
case files. We have encountered numerous FBI documents in the
numbered House Select Committee on Assassination records that must
be referred to the Bureau for authorization to disclose them. It
will be a week or so before I can give you a preliminary estimate
of how many documents this will entail.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call either me. or
George Chalou. I can be reached on (202) 501 5532. George can be
wKeached on 219 3268.

The purpose of this memo is to bring you up-to-date on our progress
in reviewing FBI -gase files relating to the ‘assassination of
President John F. Kennedy that came into the hands of the House
Select Committee on Assassinations.

Under the terms of the Kennedy Assassination Materials Disclosure
Act, we are required to complete an identification aid for each

: document in the FBI case files and to obtain the FBI's approval for

Washington, DC 20408

release of the documents. As you may recall, George Chalou, Deputy

‘Director of the NARA JFK Task Force, and Mary Henderson of your
staff, reviewed the JFK case-file and. concluded that the materials
we were reviewing appeared to be exact duplicates of what the
Bureau released under FOIA. Absent a statement from the Bureau
that the JFK case file transferred to the House Select Committee on
Assassinations is disclosable because it is an exact copy of the
case file released under FOIA, we plan to begin delivery to the
Bureau next week of 11,519 completed identification aid forms
associated with the 43 boxes or records that comprise the JFK case
file. Approximately two weeks later, we expect to deliver a
comparable number of identification aid forms for the Lee Harvey
Oswald case file. The JFK data collection database will show that
all of these documents are closed, pending completion of a FBI
review.

As you know, we have some 30 boxes of FBI documents that comprise
the Jack Ruby case file. We estimate that there will be
approximately 7,500 completed identification forms. The Ruby case
file poses unusual problems because there are two versions, one of
which appears to be nothing more than a copy of FOIA released

‘material. The second version is identified as "Committee Staff"

and appears to have fewer redactions than the FOIA released
material. We consider each version different and we are preparing
separate identification aid forms for the documents in each

version.

bAR-HQ-/029 4 O5-
It appears that the work load of both the FBI and NARA Gan be
reduced significantly if the Bureau certifies that the FBI case

files in our custody (excluding the second version of the Jack Ruby
