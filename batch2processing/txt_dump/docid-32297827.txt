then stated that, if he had previously identified subject

as a "button" or member of the CARLO GAMBINO "family", he
believed it would have been based upon a photograph displayed
to him or a license number of an automobile which he had
obtained. However, NY 3461-C-TE concluded, he does not
recall ever having heard the name PEGATORI and possesses

no information relative to one JOSEPH PEGATORI being
affiliated with the GAMBINO "family".

Inasmuch as above-described member sources are not
familiar with JOSEPH PEGATORI as a member of "La Cosa Nostra"
and investigation has developed no information which would
identify captioned subject, this matter is being closed
in the NYO.

~
NYO will remain alert to any information relative to \

one JOSEPH PEGATORI in connection with investigation being ;
conducted in case captioned "CARLO GAMBINO, aka; AR", ; |
NY 92-657, and, if any information is developed which
would indicate PEGATORI is a member of "La Cosa Nostra",
instant case will be re-opened and the Bureau advised. i
