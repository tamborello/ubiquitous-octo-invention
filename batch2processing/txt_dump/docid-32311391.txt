The enclosed Letterhead as from Mexico ‘City. It oa
sets forth speculations of Mora that Oswald could be linked
., to Mexico only through his activities prior to going to

“USSR in. 1959, Mora indicated that tie in to Mexico may lie

_in press referenceg to Oswald's activities in New Orleans :

* for the few days he was in that area prior to going to Russia’:

in September, 1959, when he was 19 years old, She also said ¢*

+ that Oswald knew Mary: Louise Patters son, (an American negress —:

presently attending the Friendship School in USSR) when he was

i: in Russia; hence we are furnishing copies of letterhead to .
“gia. four sources i ontact with Mora (the highly placed .
