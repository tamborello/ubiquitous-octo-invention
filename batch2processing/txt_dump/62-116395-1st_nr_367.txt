On 7/1/75, the SCHAFERS advised that they had
traveled to Washington, D.C., on Saturday, 6/28/75, and
were interviewed in private by KIRBOW and MICHAEL EPSTEIN,
both staff members of the Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence
Activities. It was a short interview wherein KIRBOW solicited
the general unsworn statements: of the SCHAFERS regarding the ! |
allegations against the FBI of JOE BURTON. KIRBOW stated that
he believed BURTON was a fool and was probably motivated by
self interest in his allegations. After hearing the SCHAFERS'
general statements contradictory to BURTON's allegations, ~
KIRBOW said that they confirm his impression of BURTON. The

' SCHAFERS were important to the Committee's inquiries in

characterizing BURTON, according to KIRBOW. The SCHAFERS
did not go into detail regarding their radical activities
or- relationship with the FBI, : L
KIRBOW said the SCHAFERS' statements would remain
confidential and would not be leaked to the press. KIRBOW

. said he did not expect the SCHAFERS to be asked or subpoenaed

to testify openly before the full Committee.

Re New Orleans teletype to Bureau dated 6/11/75.

Attached are one copy each of two letters to
captioned sources from Senator JOHN G. TOWER and CHARLES
KIRBOW, both dated 6/20/75.

The documents enclosed in KIRBOW's letter were
copies of JOHN CREWDSON's original "New York Times" article
of 2/16/75 and the 3/6/75 article of "WIN" magazine. The
Bureau is in possession of both of these articles.

Both SCHAFERS felt reassured by the expressions and
tone of the attached letters, enough to be willing to again
travel to Washington, D.C. on 6/28/75.
