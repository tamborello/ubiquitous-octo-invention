Re Los Angeles airtel 1/30/62.

LA 4350-C was interviewed on 3/28/62. He stated
he obtained his information through his various contacts
over the years, and that he is unable to furnish evidentiary
data or leads which could develop proof of the type desired.

ig Informant said he has heard that CHAVEZ has been

i vi indicted in Puerto Rico on some felony charges, details of

J “ which he does not know, and that as a result CHAVEZ may be
losing his importance in union matters in that area.

ye Because the informant is not in a position to
furnish additional data even though he is convinced his

which has existed, this matter is being closed. If the
yinformant at a later date does obtain data which can = be
used, it will be forwarded to the Bureau.

Vath ? original data is an accurate analysis of the situation
