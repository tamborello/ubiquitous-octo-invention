ESCALANTE, while he remained in Cuba, was apparently the
liaison officer between the DGI.and the PSP. When ESCALANTE
left Cuba, the liaison between the DGI and the PSP was

taken over by Ramiro VALDES, as a.CP member, and he was
described as a true representative. The DGI operated
strictly on orders from the Party, conveyed through VALDES,

Membership in the Partido Unido Revolucionaria Socialista
(PURS) made life easier and entry into the DGI more simple.
Between August 1963 and April 1964, a11 new personnel hired
by the DGI came from the Union de Jovenes Comunistas (Union
of Young Communists ~- UJC), which wags PURS~oriented,

THIS {8 UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT 15 TENTATIVE

SOURCE, A former Cuban IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelligence
Service until April 1964.

1. Although there are many members of the Direccion General de-
Intelligencia (General Directorate of Intelligence - DG!) who
appear interestcd itn and favorable toward the Communist ‘Party,
Source knows of only three persons who are actually members:

“ Saul CONZALEZ, aligs"Denis"; Manuel VEGA Perez, alias “Marcos.
Viera"; and Felix SUAREZ, alias “Federico Santiesteban". .
SUAREZ was a sert cf pelitical adviser in the DGI operations

_departmernts, but insisted he was not a commissar, but, rather,
a@ person in charge. Although Source and the other officers
would tease SUAREZ by calling him "“Comisario”, SUAREZ greatly
resented the term and actually physically attacked Source for
doing so. Every Saturday morning at .8:30, SUAREZ held a
political indoctrination meeting which all personnel were
fuppesed to attend Scurce was habitually late to these
sessions, and althcugh he was given penalties for his obvious
disaflection, he never paid any attentton to them, The DGI
personnel Source knew were perfectly willing to talk politics
among themselves but in a rather desultory way; the discussions
never went on very long.

2. Apparently during 1962, there had been considerable sentiment
for Anibal ESCALANTE ard his faction, the Partido Socialista
Popular (P5P), but 19 1964 the PSP group was disrupted and
the real loyalty was to Fidel CASTRO rather than to the Party.
