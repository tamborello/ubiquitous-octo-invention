Memorandum to Mr. Fehl
Re: Request For Information From Charles Jaffe

possibility that they may have at some time been contacted 1
by the FBI could not be precluded based on the limited :
identifying data supplied by Mr. Jaffe and the expeditious |
nature of the file reviews conducted in accordance with :
Mr. Jaffe's request. ;

On September 1, 1976, Mr. Charles Jaffe, SUPRA,
telephonically recontacted Supervisor Pomerantz and advised
that he, in addition to the information already furnished,
needed to know the details of any interviews conducted by !
the FBI with any of the above-listed individuals and also }
needed copies of the records of these interviews.

Mr. Jaffe stated that the trial judge would inspect
these documents in camera and make a determination as to
whether these documents would be furnished to the defense.
Mr. Jaffe explained that this would have to be accomplished

. as expeditiously as possible according to the judge's
instructions. Mr. Jaffe further advised that the Werbell
trial involved allegations on the part of the defense of
Government wrongdoing. !
