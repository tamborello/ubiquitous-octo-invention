DESCRIPTION

on October 21, 1952 to serve
five years for Grand Larceny.
Mr. P. C. CROSBY, agent for
the Northern Paci
Hamburg, Arkansas, advised
_on March 16, 1956 that he
“knew SHAW for about eight
years from 1938-1945 and stated
that SHAW drank to excess,
‘that -he was a person of no
responsibility, and he would
not recommend him for a
position of responsibility.
He further stated that SHAW
had written bad checks all

' his life, and when he made
any money, he would write a
check in a surrounding town
and use the money to buy
whiskey. CROSBY stated that
sometime in‘the early 1930's
SHAW got in a knife fight with
another Negro in Hamburg,
Arkansas. and was placed in
jail. CROSBY stated that it
was to his recollection that
the injured Negro died about
a year after the knifing,
however, he did not believe
that SHAW was: charged with
the death of the other man.
Records of the Hamburg, Arkan=
sas Police Department failed
to reflect any record that
SHAW had been in jail in’
Hamburg, Arkansas, however,
Mr. WILLIAM HADEN, Chief of:
Police at.Hamburg, Arkansas,
advised March 16, 1956 that
he .remembered SHAW had been
in a fight and had seriously
wounded another man in Hamburg
in the 1930's. SHAW. stated
that he is willing to testify
to the information that he
furnished to the FBI.
