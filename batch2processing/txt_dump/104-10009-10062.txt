this person also at the rest home
near Leningrad and that although

tension 1-60 and the address Tver-
skaya Ulitsa 18. .
NOTE: The initial A corresponds:
to the patronymic of Robert Alek-
sandrovich IVANOV, so A.K. IVANOV
could conceivably be the father
of Robert. See entry for MAKAROV
for significance of telephone nume

 

ber A0=0036.
