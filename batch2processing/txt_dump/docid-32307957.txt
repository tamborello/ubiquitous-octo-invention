3. Their associates within the Detroit family
and the relationship of these individuals to each other
(in this regard, informant should be requested to
comment on LCN members in Michigan, other than Detroit,. ve,
as well as in other parss of the U. S.) mt

   

In this regard from previous correspondence of
the San Diego Office, it appears that SD 1064-C-TE is
most closely acquainted with the Priziola Group of the
Detroit LCN family. He should be requested to comment
on the relationships and inter-relationships of any other
groups with which he may be acquainted.

 

 

4. Any information which he may be able to
relate concerning any of these individuals which might =
lead to possible prosecution. '

With reference to FAT TONY RUGGIRELLO and
BIG LOUIE RUGGIRELLS, it is generally agreed that FAT TONY
is the sharpest of the four RUGGIRELLO brothers. BIG
LOUIE is, however, the one most often referred to as being
actively engaged in the numbers racket in Detroit. At
the time that the RUGGIRELLO brothers operated a bowling
alley, all four were connected with the bowling alley, and
JOSEPH, the oldest brother, and TODD9, the youngest brother,
were the two most actively engaged in this operation. The
name of the alleys was known as the Palm Beach Gardens. The
father of the RUGGIRELLO brothers was reportedly a member
of LCN and is known to have been close to JOSEPH ZERILLI,
boss of the Detroit family.

With reference to the individuals on page 10
concerning whom the informant could furnish no information,
it is noted that ROUGH MANUEL BADALAMENTI lives in Monroe,
Michigan, and is a part of the old "Down River Gang", which
engaged in bootlegging on a large scale during the
prohibition era. He was close to JOE "ONE EYE" TOCCO and
WYANDOITE JIM PALAZZOLA, both deceased, who ran the Down
River Gangs.

JOB BARBARA, JR., is the son of the JOE BARBARA

who was host at the notorious Apalachian Meeting in New
. York in 1957.

TONY D'ANNA and SAM PERRONE are both old-
time Detroit mobsters who received a great deal of national ce!
publicity in connection with the Senator KEFAUER Committee be
hearings. PERRONE was also the subject of a bombing attack :
in January of 1964 and was given a great deal of national
publicity in this regard.

BLACK LEO CELLURA and SAM FINAZZO are both old-
time members of the Priziola Group and were suspected of
handling narcotics for many years.

 

PAUL and PETER VITALE are both originally from
. : the Wyandotte Down River Gang. They are believed to be
\ reldted to or associated with MATTE VITALE of Wyandotte,
Michigan, who may have been related to SALVATORE VITALE who
disappeared in the Detroit area in 1956, and concerning '
whom SD 1064-C-TE has previously furnished a great deal '
of information,

  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
  

Informant should further be requested to further
clarify his comments set out on page 12 of referenced
airtel in which he identifies leaders of the Detroit family.
In this regard, informant does not mention JACK TOCCO,

Son of BLACK BILL TOCCO. JACK TOCCG is generally regarded
-, as the strongest and most apt leader of the younger group
_ of the Detroit family. Also in this regard, ANGELO MELI
_ is generally reported to be one of the "strongest" men in
the Detroit family in terms of commanding respect. MELI
has been in poor health for many years and has retired from
. “LCN activities, but is still given the utmost respect by
- all members of the Detroit family. One member, informant
has. indicated that MELI is more important and stronger
“than JOE ZERILLI.

: San Diego is requested to question SD 1064-C-TE
_ concerning his knowledge of the early history of the Detroit
LCN family. Numerous reports have been received indicating
that JOE ZERILLI, who has been head of the Detroit family
for more than 40 years, was close to AL CAPONE in Chicago.
He also organized the Detroit east side mobs in the gang
wars against the old Detroit Purple Gang and eliminated

or unified the Italian mobs in Detroit in the late 20's

and early 30's to become one of the wealthiest and strongest
