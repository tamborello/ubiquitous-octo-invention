-[t has been previously
noted in other reports that the Filbén Corporation, Chicago,
was acquired from the GARSO}’ brothers, who were involved
with Major General BENNEYDONEYERS and Congressman ANDREW
JACKSON MAY. The acquisition by the Mannarino Gang was -
said to come from the fact that Attorney CHARLES J. MARGIOTTI
of Pittsburgh who represented the GARSONS was closely '

: connectea with the MANNARINOS and JOHN LA KOCCA. This
information was furnished by PHIL PETRULLI.' PETRULLI also
has advised that the MANNARINOS “lost their shirts" in this
enterprise. . .

J.C. SCHWARTZ has

 

PHIL PETRULLI and JAMES GARROK ve recently advised that -
: the MANNARINOS have purchase@#MMother Kelley's Night Club in
i MiamiBeach, Florida, howevé r, this information has not been
