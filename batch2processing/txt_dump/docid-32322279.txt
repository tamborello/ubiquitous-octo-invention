forms regarding files that were forwarded to the JFK Task Force
in 10/96. Among the files requested and forwarded was Detroit
file 92-914. The file chargeout form does not specify the volumes
sent to Headquarters but indicates “all” volumes were charged out
and forwarded to the JFK Task Force. .

notify the Task Force by EC of the results of the search, and
forward the documents if located. Detroit's reply should be
received at FBIHQ no later than C.0.B. 06/03/98.
