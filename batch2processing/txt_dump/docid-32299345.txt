had just finished his teaching contract in New York City :
and was in the process of renting his apartment and would i
hove to Miami for the summer months in order to assist :

in Miami, Florida.(%)

 

j ,, NY T-4 advised that CHIBAS also stated that he

\ was so disgusted with MANUEL RAY and the JURE that he

stated that CHIBAS told him that he was so disgusted with
\ RAY that he wanted to leave the group and would if he |
' could find another exile Cuban organization which offered i

any hope of overthrowing the present Cuban Government .(%)

' NY T-2,0n June 22, 1964, advised that as a result '
of talking to various members of the JURE and in particular

\ in conversation with RAUL CHIBAS, he was able to put ;
together the following concerning RAY's attempt to infiltrate |

Cuba: gei(uy

! MANUEL RAY arrived in Miami, Florida, on May 17, .
1964, and informed RQELIO CISNEROS that he was ready

to leave for. Cuba. This announcement caught CISNEROS a . ;

bit unaware since CISNEROS, although he had RAY's permission

to decide the route into Cuba, did not want to assume

such a responsibility, and hence, was not prepared for RAY's

departure . (uy)

 

 

CISNEROS then chartered a boat in order not to
_ use one of the JURE's boats, because they wanted to .
conceal RAY's movements. The chartered boat was painted
white and it was necessary to change its color before t
entering Cuban waters, According to information from
MANUEL RAY, it was ascertained that after departure from
Miami, one of the motors broke down and the radio transmitter
which was aboard the boat was not working. ‘These
failures indicated to many of the JURE that the plan
} of RAY was already destined for failure although it
, is assumed that RAY was serious in his statements relative

to getting into Cuba by May 20, 1964. (eu)

According to information from RAUL CHIBAS,
NY T--2 said that the entrance into Cuba was not properly
, prepared since the spot of entry on to Cuban soil was
in an area where the inside contacts were not absolutely
reliable and this pointed out the lie that RAY boasted !
— that he had an efficient underground inside Cuba. (RYU)

NY T-2 on May 22, 1954, advised that RAUL _
CHIBAS had been to Miami, Florida, during the period of i
May 15 through May 17, 1964, and up6n:his return to New
York, was strangely silent about the operation planned by :
MANUEL RAY of infiltrating into Cuba, NY T-2 said that \
CHIBAS behaved -in such a strange manner after his return : : i
from Miami that he, NY T-2, believes that RAY. must have (
suffered some setback which would preclude his being. J
Cuba by his self~imposed deadline of May 20, 1988. Oa ,

NY T-4 on June 1, 1964, advised that he had |

a lengthy meeting on May 31, 1964, with Dr. RAUL CHIBAS.

JURE had collected $60,000 as a result of their bond sell-

ing plan and MANUEL RAY had obtained additional funds from

other sources and had obtained funds from Government sources
4 and it was presumed that the Government sources were Puerto

Rico and Venezuela.(M%)o

; NY T-4 advised that,during conversation, CHIBAS
was openly critical of MANUEL RAY and. RAY's political think-
ing. CHIBAS said that as/of May 31, 1964, he. did not
know the whereabouts of RAY and felt that RAY's actions
were creating problems for the JURE because people who
contributed money were anxious to see results and. not
promises, CHIBAS also criticized RAY for making’ foolish -
purchases of military equipment and stated that RAY _
purchased a short-wave transmitter which was unnecessary oh
and also certain types of weapons which were obsolete (mw) 7

ee ee Sok. .

NY T-4 advised that in discussing the personality.
of RAY, CHIBAS stated that RAY was dictatorial, autocratic” . -
and politically unclear. CHIBAS said that in a political ; :
sense RAY blows hot and cold regarding political philosophies

 

 

and likes to have "yes men" behind him who will agree to his ; a
every whim. CHIBAS also told NY T-4 that he considered — AL
RAY to be a very definite. danger to the. future of Cuba
and that he could, if successful in getting into Cuba, turn “

out to be another FIDEL CASTRO, ome stated that he (m%) ~
