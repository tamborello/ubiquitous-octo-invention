to Litton Systems by Claire Peck who is the owner of a

large construction company. HAGERMAN said that some of the
officials of the Litton company were not too pleased with

the hiring of BARGER. HAGERMAN said he “wouldn't trust BARGER
at all. ; (

HAGERMAN said that he is not acquainted with JAMES MANN
and knows nothing about him. ‘

. He said that JACK COGAN.is a former employee of CIA,
and is a "wheeler and a dealer."

HAGERMAN said that he would conduct inquiries,
which he could do readily in line with his employment, to
identify the two men who were with BARGER and MANN and that he
would further be able to ascertain the nature of their business
dealings with Litton Systems. He added that he could easily
do this without revealing that the FBI was interested in the
matter. As of this date HAGERMAN has not advised the Los Angeles
Office of the results of his inquiries.
