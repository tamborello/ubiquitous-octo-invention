(Continued) He then came to Florida and during the 1940's,

with JIMMY ALO, FRANK ERICKSON and FRANK
COSTELLO controlled all gambling in Dade and
Broward Counties. The KEFAUVER investigation
shut down this operation in 1950 and LANSKY
went to Cuba and operated legitimately at the |
Hotel Riviera until 1958-1959 when CASTRO drove
him out. He has lived in ostensible retire-
ment since that time but might possibly have
concealed interests in gambling casinos in

Las Vegas.

His present associates include JIMMY ALO, his
brother, JACK LANSKY, and he is friendly with
several Las Vegas figures who have Florida
interests. Among these are SAM TUCKER, MORRIS
KLEINMAN and HYMIE ABRAMS. — ,

“At present New York City has his daughter as

a CI and Miami has a highly confidential source
in his home. LANSKY is presently touring
Europe with his wife.. During the past two
years he has been in and out of hospitals for
reoccurring ulcers and heart trouble. Best.
possibility for incarceration appears to be to .
link him with concealed interests in Las Vegas.

TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM

At present the Miami Office has under considera- :
tion the following individuals for development in captioned
program:

HYMIE MARTIN

MARTIN came to Miami several years ago from
Pittsburgh where he associated with SAMUEL and GABRIEL
MANNARINO. The MANNARINOs are subjects of top hoodlum cases
considered for éarly prosecution by the Pittsburgh Office.
MARTIN is directing the operation of HAROLD FISHMAN, subject
of Miami ITAR case 166-43, in which FISHMAN has been,an er-
rand boy who travels to San Juan and New York City in connec-
tion with illegal numbers operation. MARTIN is considered to
be one of the best informed individuals of ovérall gambling in
South Florida, Miami has.a highly confidential source and 2
informants furnishing information regarding MARTIN. The
FISHMAN investigation has not yet reached a point where process
can be obtained, but it is hoped that when FISHMAN can be ar-
rested that a conspiracy warrant can be obtained for MARTIN.
It is felt that any interview with MARTIN along the lines of
captioned program would be premature until he is arrested,
not only because he would be more inclined to cooperate at
that time, but an interview prior to FISHMAN's arrest would
substantially hamper that investigation.

- STEPHANO ANTHONY. RANDAZZO
RANDAZZO was born in Sicily, settled in Cleveland
when he came to this country where he engaged in various enter-
prises, the last of which was owning a bar and lounge. He came

to Miami 14 years ago and has operated 2 restaurants in the
past in Miami. At present he is unemployed, He is friendly

with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, top hoodlum of the Tampa Office, and
also with CARLO GAMBINO, of New York, who is a member of the

" Commission.'' RANDAZZO has been interviewed in connection
with this program, at which time he was cordial and the inter-
view was.conducted on a friendly basis. He furnished some —
general intelligence information regarding several subjects

in which the Bureau is interested. Information was developed
that several years ago while RANDAZZO was still operating one

of his restaurants, he was approached to take a public relations
job with the Amusement Machine Operators Association, whose
President was WILLIE BLATT. BLATT, both then and now, is in

the music. vending machine business in Miami. At that time these
operators were attempting to form a union and there were several
reports of strong arm procedures being used and RANDAZZO was
blamed for these. RANDAZZO was of the opinion CHARLES KARPF
was responsible for the strong arm methods. As a result of

this a number of persons were subpoenaed to testify before

the Senate Rackets Committee, and, in fact, RANDAZZO was sub-
poenaed, RANDAZZO said he did not testify, but was interviewed
by ROBERT KENNEDY, who at that time was General Counsel for the
Committee. .

THOMAS ALTAMURA

ALTAMURA is allegedly involved in a bookmaking
operation on Miami Beach, fronted for him by JOSEPH CHIERICO,
who operates Sonny's Restaurant, 23rd Street, and allegedly |
is involved in Shylocking. ALTAMURA has been seen in company
of CARLO GAMBINO, member of the "Commission,'' and knows SANTO .
TRAFFICANTE. ‘Considerable investigation has been conducted —
regarding ALTAMURA, but as yet this has not brought out informa-

- tion that apparently would place him in a position of suscépti-

bility to development.

. ALVIN I. MALNIK

: MALNIK is an attormey; represents JIMMY HOFFA
and a mumber of other racket figures in whom the Bureau is
interested, including GIL BECKLEY and AL MONES, gambler and
layoff better who was indicted in.New Orleans with several
others in IRS case involving umauthorized use of telephone
service. MALNIK is an acquaintance of SA ARTHUR S, MARGULIS
who knew him as a teenager, MALNIK practices law on the
West Coast of this country-and is in Miami intermittently.
MALNIK volunteerly contacted SA MARGULIS and furnished in-
formation in general terms about some of his clients which
was of general intelligence value. Permission has been
granted by the Bureau to recontact MALNIK in connection with
this program, but efforts to contact him again in Miami have
hot yet met with success. It is noted that a West Coast of-
fice interviewed MALNIK regarding a specific matter and he
furnished them some information. :

PHIL SIDANO

SIDANO has been an associate of JOSEPH MASSEI and
ANTHONY SALERNO, both of whom are top hoodlums, in the
capacity of "messenger boy." SIDANO frequents 23rd Street,
Miami Beach, and allegedly is Shylocking at'this time. In-
vestigation has not developed any particular reason why it
is thought SIDANO would cooperate if contacted in regard to
captioned program, but permission has been requested of the
Bureau to interview him about general intelligence matters,
which permission has not yet been-‘received.

In the past.the Miami Office has had under considera-
tion in captioned program: JOHN KING, aka John Angersola,
and AL MONES, both of whom have been interviewed and showed
no sign:of ‘desiring to cooperate in any way with the Bureau.
They were thus eliminated from the program. JOHN KING was
a former member of the Detroit "Purple'’ Gang, and AL MONES
is a nationally known gambler and layoff better.
