on September 29, 1958, that one of his investigators was
able to review the income tax returns of GUS ALEX during
the years 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, and 1956. Mr. DUFFY
stated that'the only information the investigator made

as JAMES ALLEGRETTI, JOHNNY "Bananas" DE BIASE, and LENNIE
PATRICK, are frequent diners at the Club Continental, a ;
plush Rush Street night club. This informant stated that

to be "The Boss of the Loop" for the Chicago Crime Syndicate.
He stated that any problems which arise among gamblers in the
Loop are settled by GUS ALEX, and that he feels certain that
no bookie can operate in the Loop without the sanction of
ALEX, He reiterated information in this regard, which he has
furnished previously concerning the attempt of a prominent
hoodlum to "muscle" in on the informant's business, and
stated that. he continues to operate free from such "muscling"
after he successfully sought the intervention and protection
of ALEX. He feels that this continued "guardianship" of GUS
. ALEX has enabled him to operate in the Loop free from hoodlum
interference and free from the usual fifty per cent which the
syndicate extracts from each gambler. It is noted that above
under the caption "ASSOCIATES" and the sub-caption "LOUIS
TORNABENE" information is set out concerning the intervention
of GUS ALEX in a dispute between T-5 and LOUIS TORNABENE.
As noted above, the informant stated that one of the most
significant things to him in the entire dispute was the fact
that in spite of the weight of SAM BATTAGLIA, who is regarded
among hoodlums in Chicago as a very influential syndicate
leader coupled with MAISH BAER, who is also highly regarded
among Chicago hoodlums although not so much so as BATTAGLIA,
and one POPE, the fact that GUS ALEX sided with TORNABENE
in the issue was sufficient to settle the dispute in
TORNABENE's favor with no objection from BATTAGLIA, BAER,
or POPE, It is noted further that this dispute concerned
a gambling operation in the Santa Fe Hotel, located at Polk
and Dearborn Streets in the first ward of Chicago. This
information would, therefore, tend to substantiate information
previously reported that GUS ALEX controls the first ward for
the syndicate. The first ward includes the Loop, the near
South Side, and the near West Side, being Chicago's largest
geographic ward.

2. The South Side

T-8 and T-9, who have furnished reliable information
in the past, were contacted during October, 1958. These
individuals are very well acquainted with many hoodlums and
particularly with individuals engaged in the policy racket
on the South Side of Chicago.

action regarding the g bling debt. The informant spotted
the two individuals sitting outside his home and then decided
to go directly to S ATTAGLIA to force the issue.

¥

: On the evening st September 24, 1958, the informant
was called to the Santa Fe“Bar for a meeting with TORNABENE

~ and POPE, At that time also present was an individual known as
"Chappie," who is a close associate of LOUIS TORNABENE and
GUS ALEX in gambling operations. The informant advised
CHAPPIE at this meeting would directly represent GUS ALEX's
interest in.the dispute. The informant advised that POPE,

, the representative of SAM BATTAGLIA, ‘was described ag white,

‘ male, Italian, 55, light complected, average height and
"skinny." ee .

that he had been muscled out of money. honestly owed to him

by TORNABENE and that he is_ presently making efforts through his

eastern contacts, which would be the former "Joe Adonis"

Gang, of whom there are a few members ‘left operating on the

East Coast, who are very powerful in the Jersey City and New
“York City area. The informant hoped through this connection

to have coritact made directly to TONY ACCARDO, who would then 1

settle the dispute himself. The informant advised that if he

is successful with his East Coast contacts, they will send |

aman to Chicago to make the contact with ACCARDO. He

advised he would keep this office advised of the entire

situation as it develops. °

The informant further advised that LOUIS TORNABENE
has huge sums of money available at all times for his gambling
operations and that he maintains several safety deposit boxes
at the Central National Bank, located east of Halsted Street
on the north side of Roosevelt Road. He advised that this
bank is also used as a place for storing gambling money by
other hoodlums in the Chicago area; however, he did not know a
the specific individuals outside of TORNABENE using the
bank's facilities.

T-5 further advised that during the period of time
when he was in closé contact and in the good graces of LOUIS
TORNABENE, TORNABENE boastéd to him that GUS ALEX is anxious
to lend him $20,000.00 for TORNABENE's own use in bookmaking.
TORNABENE stated that he has not accepted the twenty grand
but also said that GUS ALEX has offered-part of the policy
racket on the South Side of Chicago. TORNABENE indicated
that he is interested in the policy angle.

HENRYYSUSK yr ye

Attention is drawn to the fact that it has
previously been reported that HENRY SUSK is a close friend
of GUS ALEX, and that SUSK has furnished ALEX with several
automobiles, which remain registered to SUSK but are used
principally by ALEX. Also, that SUSK has furnished a
diner's credit card to ALEX, and that ALEX utilizes this
card for meals.

T-1 advised that on , September 26, 1958, HENRY
SUSK dined with GUS and MARIANNE ALEX, and that MARIANNE
ALEX attempted to do the cooking on this occasion and
burned both the steak and potatoes, which she attempted
to cook.

EDDIE «VOGEL 7
Reported above under bie “caption, "NATHAN 'BUTCH!

LADON", is information that SAs FRANKFURT and ROEMER observed

LEADON drive the Cadillac which he. has been using to chauffeur

ALEX, to the residence of EDDIE VOGEL, on October 15, 1958.

On October 20, 1958, SA FRANKFURT’ observed LADON driving

On October 15, 1958, HERB WARD, Manager, Beach
Garage, 5939 South Lake Park, advised SAg PAUL B. FRANKFURT
and ROEMER that "BUTCH" LADON does not keep his Pontiac.
in the Beach Garage as he did heretofore, but instead
now keeps a 1958 black Cadillac Fleetwood 60 Special,
Illinois license number 1.70 148, in the garage. It is
noted that this is the car that LADON has been using to
chauffeur ALEX. WARD also furnished information that LADON
has now changed his pattern in that he now takes his car
from the garage around 10 a.m., whereas his former procedure
was to take the car before 9 a.m., and sometimes before 8 a.m.

A surveillance of "BUTCH" LADON on October 15,
1958, by SAs FRANKFURT and ROEMER determined that LADON
entered the Beach Garage at 10:21 a.m. and left it at
10:22 a.m., driving the above mentioned Cadillac. At 10:37 a.m.
LADON exited from Lake Shore Drive at the Fullerton Street
exit. At 10:52 a.m., the above described Cadillac was
observed in a parking space at 320 Oakdale, the residence
of EDDIE VOGEL and FRANK FERRARO, .

It is noted that LADON previous to his employment
‘as a chauffeur by ALEX was a chauffeur-body guard for EDDIE
VOGEL, and the above information tends to indicate that
LADON has resumed his associatéon with VOGEL.

THOMAS $8 Xunrzz0 ~

It is noted that T-5 has ‘furnished ififormation
which has previously been reported, indicating that one
"TOMMY" was a close associate of GUS ALEX, and that "TOMMY"
was used by the hoodlums for contacts with the mayor of
‘Chicago. It has also been reported that investigation
determined that the "TOMMY" referred to by CG 6232-C is.in
all probability THOMAS SAMmunTZZ0.

On September 2h, 1958, T-5 was contacted to
determine if the previous information which he had furnished
regarding "TOMMY" concerned THOMAS S. MUNIZZO, 305 West 3st.

Conpany at that address. This informant stated that this

As has been previously reported, Lours@onki bane
is a close associate of GUS ALEX, and operates handbooks
in the Loop area of Chicago, over which ALEX allegedly
holds the principal interest. T-5 advised on September 2h,
1958, that for the past six months he has been a partner
of LOUIS TORNABENE in a gambling establishment which the
informant and TORNABENE operated at the Santa Fe Hotel,
Polk and Dearborn Streets, Chicago. During the course
of this joint venture, T-5 stated that TORNABENE became
obligated to him in the amount of approximately $15,000. 005
as well as a personal gambling debt amounting to an
additional $4,000.00. TORNABENE refused to pay the

informant his winnings because the informant had quit on

a specific crap game in which TORNABENE was playing against
other persons, some being backed by the informant. The
informant, at the time of quitting, was winning money from:
TORNABENE. The informant dontacted SAM BATTAGLIA, highly
placed Chicago hoodlum, through an intermediary and BATTAGLIA
sent an individual named FNU POPE to see the informant.

POPE said he would have to get both sides of the story in
regards to the gambling debtsand would have a ruling in a day
