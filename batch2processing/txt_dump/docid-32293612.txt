PH 92-4l4i,

ascertained that FRANK NICOLETTI and IGNAZIO DENARO will
meet source at 8:30 p.m. in front of 911 South Eighth
Street to furnish informant transportation to La Cosa Nostra
meeting. Possibly six individuals, identity unknown to
’ informant, will be "made" at instant meeting. Informant
learned from BRUNO that he will also be given the "new rules"
of La Cosa Nostra. :

f
on 5/25/64, informant agreed to wear recording
device while atteriding this meeting in effort to record
induction ceremony of La Cosa Nostra.

Philadelphia in 5/18/64 teletype advised that they
would make recommendations concerning La Cosa Nostra initiation
and information re alleged burial grounds of La Cosa Nostra .
in Cumberland County, N. J. Accordingly, Philadelphia a
recommends that no open investigation be undertaken at .
this time re burial grounds in Cumberland County, N. J. S
This recommendation is made not to jeopardize informant, y
noting that individuals allegedly buried vanished from Phila-
delphia area more than 20 years ago.
. i
{
t

: Philadelphia recommendations insofar as coverage
of La Cosa Nostra meeting 6/15/64 as follows:

 

No open surveillance will be conducted UACB. ,
Philadelphia contemplates extremely discreet coverage of
bridges from Philadelphia area into New Jersey during
pertinent period of evening of 6/15/64. Informant has suggested |
that meeting possibly will be at motel of PAT MASSI in Camden
County, N. J.3; however, this information is not known to be. .
a fact.

It is requested that the Bureau grant authority
so that the informant can record meeting. Philadelphia will, Jot
of course, secrete the recorder on the informant's body :

to afford all possible security. The informant is cognizant a
of the danger involved in having a recorder on his person while ne
at this meeting. It is requested that the Laboratory at

. earliest date forward to Philadelphia the latest model Edwards

. Budaural & Recorder with supplies and explanation as to '

n operation.

 

 

hh , The Bureau will be kept advised of developments in this
' matter.
