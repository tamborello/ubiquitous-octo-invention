MEMORANDUM FOR : Director of Security
ATTENTION : Alien Affairs Staff
SUBJECT : AMMUG-1

- 1, There is no question in my mind that AMMUG-1 is
a bona fide defector or that he has furnished us with
accurate and valuable information concerning Cuban intel-
ligence operations, staffers, and agents.

2. The information furnished by AMMUG-1 has been
established as accurate through our examination of FID
material, results of travel controls and reports from
independent sources, His information has given us the
potential and opportunity to take effective measures to
safeguard United States Government interests.

3. AMMUG-1 has stated that he never was and is not
now a member of the Communist Party. His polygraph
results indicate that he has been truthful in discussing his
personal history and ig providing information, .

4. I should like to have, as soon as possible, an Immigra-
tion and Naturalization identity document form I-94 plus an I-512
form which will permit him to travel to other areas and to
return to the United States, It is possible that it will be neces-
sary for him to travel on short notice in effecting recruitment or
defections of key Cuban intelligence staffers and agents. I
hardly can over-emphasize the urgency in this case as delay
in expeditious travel may result in our losing operational /
Opportunities of great value to the United States Government.
