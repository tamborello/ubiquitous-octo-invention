THE VNQDD STRONGHOLD. THE TXPT, ALTHOUGH COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF FORMER

VNQDD MEMBERS, WAS ESTABLISHED ESSENTIALLY AS & BUDDHIST ASSOCIATION
_AND HAS: BEEN LEGALLY ENGAGED tN civic AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES SINCE

ITS FORMATION. CLANDESTINE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION NAS PROCEEDED

FOR THE PURPOSE | OF DEVELOPING NEW, YOUNGER LEADERS, AND OF DENYING
THE OLDER PASSIVE TENETS OF BUDDHISM 4S WELL AS YHE OLDER LEADERS

VAN CU, ONE OF THE TWO PILOTS WHO SOMBED THE
ON 27 FEBRUARY 1962.)
2, THE TXPT CENTRAL COMMITTEE REMINDED Lue THAT THE ORGANI-

‘ZATION WAS IN A POSITION TO HANDLE A COUP ACTION IM CENTRAL, VIETNAM
_ EFFECTIVELY, POINTING OUT ‘THAT THOSE MILITARY UNITS NOT CONTROLLED
_-couto BE NEUTRAL IZED AND THAT THE AIR BASE AT DA NANG COULD BE
CONTROLLED THROUGH THE AIR FORCE. THE COMMITYEE STATED THAT, AFTER
“THE ANTI-BUDDHIST ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE WERE READY
| FOR AN UPRISING. BY TAKING NGO DINH CAN AND ARCHBISHOP NGO DINH

THUC INTO CUSTODY AND BY GAINING MILITARY CONTROL OVER THUA THIEN

; AND QUANG” NAM PROVINCES, SUCCESS COULD BE ASSURED IN CENTRAL VIETNAM.
THIS WOULD PLACE THE TXPT IN A POSITION OF USING PRESIDENT DIEM'S
, TACTICS OF NEGOTIATIONS AGAINST HIM, 1|.E., HAVING GAINED CONTROL

OVER’ “CENTRAL VITETNAM ;. THEY. WOULD OFFER TO NEGOTIATE WITH DIEM

AND , AT THE ~ SAME TIME, THEY WOULD BE: MOUNT ING A cour AGAINST THE
REGIME IN SAIGON, WHICH WOULD TAKE PLACE NO LATER THAN THREE DAYS
AFTER THE ‘ONE IN CENTRAL VIETNAM.

3. LUC SENT A TRUSTED: FOLLOWER, ONE VIET ° TO’ SAIGON TO DISCUSS
THE PLAN WITH AN OPPOSITIONIST SYMPATHIZER AND GET HIS VIEWPOINT. .
VIET WAS ADVISED TO TELL LUC THAT ANY SUCH ACTION WAS PRECIPITATE
AND DANGEROUS. ALTHOUGH 'T WAS PROBABLY TRUE THAT THE FORMER VoD

. MEMBERS IN.CENTRAL VIETNAM HAD THE POWER CLAIMED, A COUP THERE,

WITHOUT SIMULTANEOUS ACTION IN SAIGON, WOULD LEAVE A VACUUM WHICH
THE VIET CONG (vc) COULD IMMED | ATELY USE TO THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE.

vC REACTION PROBABLY WOULD TAKE THE FORM oF GAINING CONTROL OF ALL
AREAS: NoT EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED BY THE COUP GROUP, WITH THE
ULTIMATE: "POSSIBILITY OF PARTITIONING CENTRAL VIETNAM, OF BEING IN A

POSITION TO FORM A REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT, AND FINALLY, OF BEING

ABLE TO CALL FOR NEGOTIATIONS - THEMSELVES. ACCORDING TO VIET, THIS
FOLLOWED Luc's THINKING, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE H!S FOLLOWERS WERE NoT
IN A POSITION to ACT IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. VIET

THOUGHT THAT ‘LUC WOULD INSTRUCT THE TXPT CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN.
CENTRAL VIETNAM TO TAKE NO ACTION AT THIS TIME, AND THAT LUC'S

ADVICE WOULD BE ACCEPTED.
