C. In mid-Novenber after the postponement of ANTRUNK~13's
Madrid trip, preparations began to launch Operation
PMTRORE XJ in car’y Paceaber. This operatiou sould attexpt
to re-organize the ratline to and from Havana and the
ANTRUNK infil area for the future use of infiltrated
MHAPRON recruiters and other agent assets ag necessary.
Secondary objectives are to bring into the tufil area

& cache of weapons and explosives for AMTRUNK=10/AMLASH~1
and to teach a systen of S/W to one or more assets in the
area. The team is to be composed of the same four individ-
uals who participated in Operation ANTEUNK 1X in October
1964; AMAGRKE-1, Team Leader; AWAKA-1, Radio Operator;
and AHTRUNK~16 and 20, Guides, It was gécided tu sheive
the V-20 as the Intermediate Craft (IC) for this opera=
tion and substitute a 17' Johnson boat with twin 75 hp.
outboard motors which could maneuver through shallower
water and which could be more easily camouflaged. The
basic reason for this decision was the fact that Decem
ber through February are the low-water months in the
AMTRUKK operational area. During this shallow water
season, the heavier, wider ¥Y-20 can only be used in the
decper and sore heavily-guarded infiltration canals.

D. Through the combined efforts of AMICE~14, the AMTRUNE
P/A, and AMAGRER~1 and AMAKA-1, four radio operator
candidates, to be trained for future use in PH Opuran
tions, were recruited during the reporting period.

B. Recruiting for MHAPRON infiltration candidates con~
tinued during the reporting period. One progpectivo
dafiltree was recruited during the month of Noveaber

and the case officer was active in assessing and debrief
dug two other candidates. It is hoped that by March 1965
one or nore of these candidates will be trained and pre~
pared for infiltration for clandestine MUAPRON recruit-
ing. Ip lerge measure this will depend upon the success
of Operation AMTERUNE K in re~organizing the ratline to
and from Havana.

F. S/® Weasage No. 13 was sent to ANTREUNE-11 in response
to his Message No. 15 in which he stated that both OWVL
receivers were now in his possession. WAVE Measage No.
13 to ANTHUNEK~11 gave directions for the disposition of
the OWVL receivers and the activation of OWVL contact
with both AMTRUNK~11 and ANTRUNK-10.

OPERATIONAL ACTIVITY

      
  

A. Preparations vere underway in early November to
dispatch ANTRUNK-13 to Hadrid in mid-Novenber to cement
the recruitment of AKTRUNK-19. These plang fell
through when the Madrid Station notified Headquarters
and WAVE thet their workload would not allow gufficient
case officer time to handle AMTEUNK~13 in Madrid at this
time. WAVE agreed to postpone ANTRUNK~13's trip to
Madrid several weeks until Madrid Station's workload
abated somewhat.

 
        
     
          
     
    
   
  

B. The prospects of finalizing the recruitment of

ANTRUNK-19 increased however with the receipt at WAVE

of another open letter from AMTRUNE-19, this one

mailed from Mexico City in mid-November. 11 ANTRUNE-19 'g

first letter, mailed from Montrenl in mid-October, he

suggested using a friend in Hexico City as a cut-out to

initiate a channel of communications between himself and
ihe’ In his second letter, AKTRUKK-19 stated

mmm

 
      
     
    
     
      
    
 

that be had made the necessary arrangements with his
friend in Mexico. Although WAVE, Headquarters and WEXI
traces on AMTRUNK~19's friend, IDEN A, were fragmentary,
Mexico Station stated that IDEN A was well-known to one
of its PBRUMEN assets who vouched for IDEN A's loyalties.
WAVE intends to send an innocuous letter to AMTRUNE~-19 in
ANTRUNE-13's handwriting to keep the channel with 4-19
alive. AMTRUNK-19 appears eager to see ANTRONE~13 again
and has stated in both letters that he has considerable
information to discuss in detail. It is well realized
that this open letter channel is far from ideal but it
is hoped that in early January 1965 ANTRUNK~13 can re~
contact AKTRUNK~19 and provide him with a system of S/s.
