@) ;
fir (Posts has reported that COR headed the Steerin
Committee of the ited States China People's Friendship
Association. :

The COE's reside at 7659 Argyle Road, Brooklyn, NY.
He is the opergtog of the Farm Research, Inc. (FR), 126 Liberty
Street, NYC. CG fo5Z7bs was told by BERGMAN to send personal

correspongence to FR,WAindicating that this was a cover post
orice

NY 504-S nas reported in the past that he learned
FR was an office for pro-Peking Communists.

RICHARD CYRIL FRANK is the subject. of a pending
IS-CH case, Bu 100-401762, NY 100-107383, OO:NY. He is
husband of SUE FRANK and is employed as a free lance Ass
Director, Director's Guild of America, 59 Hast 34th Stre
NYC.

 

The offices of PR have been utilized since 1966 on
a regular basis by CHARLES and ROSE COE, as well as RICHARD
FRANK, . ;

 

in view of the above, it would appear that the
BERGMAN's have now been accepted into the close relationship
that previously existed between the COE'S and the FRANKS,

ReNYlet reports negative contacts with established
Chinese sources to determine likelihood of USCPFA being an
RU front organization

Investigation is continuing regarding this organization
and as soon as any further evidence is received that it is an

RU front, the Bureau and the San Francisco Division will be
promptly advised, ; oe
