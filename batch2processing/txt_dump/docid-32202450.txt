_ Wilson could recall no conversations with John Mitchell about
the appearance of Maheu at the Department of Justice, ,he said that
Maheu's appearance was well-known within the Department. He said that
he received no direction from Attorney General Mitchell to make these
arrangements.

Wilson stated that the details for the appearance were worked out

Cc by Lynch, Wilson , and the attorney out on the strike force who subsequently

U

became chief of the Kansas City Strike Force. (At one point in the interview,
Wilson thought this individual was David Nissen.) Wilson stated that the
!~ purpose for his close examination of Maheu was to discover if there had
been any secret trades among the casino owners in Las Vegas and if there
were any "capitalized skim" that was included in the sales price. Wils on
Nm stated that he did not find any such skim after his examination of Maheu.
2 Wilson stated that he was convinced that Parvin-Dohrman as
sellers of a casino had retained an over-ride ("skim"), but that that was
always difficult to prove in the cases that came before the Department.
Wilson indicated that he got nothing from Maheu that was very satisfactory
to support his theory of capitalized skim.

Wilson was also aware that the organized crime section had
discussed the matter with staff of the Anti-Trust Division of Justice. The
Organized Crime division wanted Anti-Trust Division personnel to be assigned

to the strike forces themselves. Wilson took up this problem of getting the

Wilson stated that a lot of effort was going into the skimming
operations in Las Vegas by the Criminal Division. Wilson felt that Maheu
would be a very helpill witness because of his hostility we Hughes because
of the recent break, However, even with Maheu's hostility, he was not a
particularly helpful witness (surprise!),

Wilson could recall no meeting with John Dean and Attorney
General Mitchel in which they discussed the acquisition by Hughes of
the Dunes Hotel. While Wilson stated that he wouldn't rule it out, he
said that it was unlikely. Wilson also recalls no investigation into the
Dunes, although there was a large investigation into Continental Connectors
and Parvin-Dormann. Wilson noted that Justice Douglas was on retainer
to Parvin-Dorhmann, and that he was convinss Parvin-Dorhmann ran a
skimming operation in Las Vegas.

Wilston stated that he learned of all this background information
concerning Maheu from a secret file in the Justice Department. He stated
that there was a Giacamo file in the Organized Crime Section, and among _
those files was a special secret file on Robert Maheu. ‘Wilson recalled
discussing this matter with J. Edgar Hoover, since Hoover had apparently
fired Maheu upon learning of his organized crime connections. (This makes
no sense.) Wilson stated that these files were either in the central filing
room in the Department or Possibly could be back in the Criminal Division.
Other individuals who saw these files on Giacamo and Maheu included Bill
Lynch, Attorney Genera] Mitchell, Henry Petersen, and Jack Keeny. Jack

Keeny now heads up the fraud section of the Criminal Division, and Ed

Conversation with Will Wilson, Wednesday, February 6, 1974

I spoke toWill Wilson, former Assistant Attorney General in

charge of the Criminal Division, on February 6, 1974, at approximately

Cl TOTAL DEAL

 

6:15 p.m. Wilson presently has offices at 1003 International Life Building,

ce]

Austin, Texas. His home telephone is 512/GL3-0559, and his office phone
is 512/472-1766. The purpose of the telephorie call was to learn if Wilson
'\ had any information relating to the waived grand jury appearance of Robert

Maheu in early 1971 or relating to the acquisition of the Dunes Hotel by

 

Hughes in 1970.

Q Wilson recalled that the Justice Department had an investigation

° going on in Los Angeles back in 1970 and 71. He believes that the strike
force had an investigation into skimming in Las Vegas and had requested
Robert Maheu's presence before a grand jury out there. Apparently, Maheu

did not want to appear before the grand jury, and informed the U.S. Attorney

in charge that he would voluntarily appear before officials at the Department

of Justice rather than go before the grand jury. When the U. S. Attomey

checked with superiors at the Department of Justice, everyone apparently

thought that the appearance in Washington would be sufficient, and so
