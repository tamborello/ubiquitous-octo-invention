Informal Requests

Each of the following informal requests was previously made to CIA. For future
reference, they will be referred to by the “Informal Request” (IR) number provided
below. .

‘GTA-IR-01 ‘Personnel Assigned to Post from 1959-64 (see RIF 104-10065-10199).

This request is complete.
CIA-IR-02 Location of Cable Identified in JEK 1993.07.20.10.18:29:650630.
This request is complete.
“CIA-IR-03 Full Computer Search for List of Documents in HTLINGUAL File.

-CIA agreed to undertake a computer run for all HTLINGUAL documents in
April 1997. To date, no response has been received by ARRB. All computer
searches for these documents should be documented in a formal letter for the
record.

™CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton’s Files.

The Review Board seeks to ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to
account for any files that James Jesus Angleton possessed or controlled that
related to the assassination and to Lee Harvey Oswald. Because of the perceived
controversy surrounding the disposition of Angleton’s files, the Review Board
believes it prudent to obtain a clear understanding of the types of files that he
maintained and their ultimate disposition. (The Review Boatd does not seek to
explore any subjects in Angleton’s files beyond those that may have pertained to”
the assassination.) To date, CIA has made available certain documents provided
by the CIC and the case files for Mangold v. CIA. The Review Board requests any
additional information in the possession of CIA that would explain the
disposition of Angleton’s files.

In addition, the ARRB staffs review of the Mangold v. CIA files designated
additional documents from those files as assassination records. These documents
are: Tab D, documents Nos. 95, 109-116, 120, and 121; and from the Denied

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

Iam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious

concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board’s requests for

additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CLA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Fredrick C. Wickham @ DO _
DO JFK Focal Point ~
FROM: J. Barry Harrelson
CSIHHRG
JFK Project Officer
SUBJECT: Priority Requests from ARRB Staff
REFERENCE:
REQUESTS:

1. The ARRB Staff is planning to interview Russ Holmes about his JFK Ancillary (working) Files. Oave Marwell has requested that
Holmes be given on one day clearance so that he can look to the files. How do you want to handle?

2. Has David Vance Vanek (SSN|__| ever worked for the Agency (D0)? Vanek is an army officer who served in
Thailand and Vietnam; could have been detailed to Agency. He figurés in one of the conspiracy theories that the ARRB staff is currently
taking depositions on. Can 00 check or is this an OP issue -- we have not had alot of luck with GP. Initially the ARRB staff was going
te make this a formal request, but agreed to hold off for the mament. The theory involves counter-terrorism training and the death of an
American with knowledge of JFK assassination.

3. Agency Officers in Moscow: The ARRB staff is researching Oswald's contacts in Moscow. The records shows that he came into
contact with other Americans besides Snyder (the Consular Officer. Gunn requested a list of the CIA officers in Moscow a few weeks
ago. Based on discussions with Eilie, etc., | told him a list did not exist and would he considered very sensitive if we did prepare one. [
ask him to be more specific; if he had names, we would check against Agency records. Since then his staff has located a list of senior ©
officers in Moscow prepared for the HSCA (Eileen has copy|. He has now resurrected his requests. Let discuss the next step.

4. Did Mrs. G. Stanley Brown (Verna Deane Stebbens Brown, born 12 August 1928) work for the Agency; what was her status
when she was in Moscow as Embassy receptionist/secretary? She is the wife of George Stanley Brown, an Agency employee from
1952-1962. According to the ARRB staff, she had contact with Oswald (see item #3).

E will give you a call on Friday to discuss our responses to the above request...
