magazine at a very nominal sum. BROWDER explained that he had

‘hoped to write some articles concerning his "revolutionary ac-

tivities and the Costa Ricah Revolution" in order to earn some
money but that the sum offered by the magazine had been so
meager that he had not considered it worth while..

Vio Ge Cel 1%,

At the time of his arrest, BROWDER was also in posses-_
sion of a telegram from HENRYALUCE dated November 19, 195, and
with respect thereto, BROWDER' stated he had proposed to the owner-
editor of "Time" and "Life" magazines that he would furnish com-
plete facilities to a neporter and photographer from those maga-
zines to cover the expected Costa Rican revolution at close range.
He stated that he had been unable to complete arrangements with
LUCE because of his arrest.

 

It was advised by T-1 that at the time of his detention
the Subject had no clothes or personal effects whatsoever, that
he was sleeping on the couch in the boardinghouse because of his
inabllity to pay for a room and that he was absolutely destitute.
T-1 expressed the opinion that all of the foregoing "business
ventures" as described by BROWDER were merely desperate attempts
by him to obtain advances or downpayments on proffered services
or material even though the possibility of his delivering in con-
nection with any of them was completely negligible,

BROWDER stated that at the time of his arrest he had
been in Mexico City for more than two months and that he had
resided at Calle Asturias #16, Altos, Colonia Alamos, and later
at Calle Tehuantepec #200A, Colonia Roma, prior to moving to
the Alvaro Obregon address.

T-1 stated Subject's former landlady had appeared at
Immigration headquarters in an effort to collect rent and board
which she claimed was due her for Subject's residence at Calle
Tehuantepec #200A,

‘This investigatién is predicated on information re-
ceived from T-1, of known reliability, to the effect that Sub-
ject EDWARD BROWDER, JR., had been arrested by agents of the
Mexican Ministry of Government (Immigration) on November 28,
1954. It was stated that the arrest had taken place in Mexico
City at Calle Alvaro Obregon #51-A, that address being a small

| . boarding house in-which Subject had been residing for several
| days as an alleged student of Mexico City College.

TI, STATUS OF SUBJECT IN MEXICO : S

 
 
    
    

T-1 advised that Subject was being held by Mexican
Immigration authorities for illegal entry to and residence in
Mexico since he claimed to have left Mexico subsequent to his
earlier escape from the Department of Immigration Lockup on
une 16, 195). It was also mentioned by T-1 that charges could
conceivably be placed against the Subject for violation of bond
in connection with a previous arrest in Mexico on a charge of
"fraud" and also for escape. It was the opinion of T-1, how-
ever, that the Mexican Immigration Department might prefer to
deport Subject rather than press criminal charges against him
as a result of which he would probably have to serve a prison
sentence in the penitentiary of the Federal District.

ated

It was advised by T-2, of known reliability, that Sub-
ject was endeavoring to obtain funds from his acquaintance and
alleged co- ~revolutionary, ROSEND RGUBLLO, JR., with which to -
finance his own “voluntary departure" from Mexico in order to
avoid formal deportation proceedings which might render his pos-
sible return to Mexico more difficult. Subject stated to T-2
that he preferred not to be deported to the United States but
that he hoped he might be sent to Guatemala where he claimed

to have "friends,' . A 1)
. - ~_
| Bil

T-1l advised that as of January 12, 1955, ject was
still detained by Immigration authorities and that in view of
his failure to provide funds for a "voluntary departure," he
probably would be deported by the Mexican Government in the
not too distant future.

TIT, ACTIVITIES OF SUBJECT Ns KN 4

The follawing narrative of Subject's recent activities
in Mexico and Central America was furnished by him to Tel and T-2; ~
however, it was the opinion of T-1 that Subject exaggerates
greatly and that he appears to.be either a pathological liar or
to be slightly mentally deranged, :

BROWDER claimed that following his escape in Mexico
in June, 1951, he had made his way to Costa Rica and Guatemala
and eventually had flown a P-l.7 airplane in the interests of the
cASTrL Lepasas revolution in Guatemala, He claimed he had been
paid $1,/000 (U.S.). in connectPUH”"Witi’those services but that
CASTILLO ARMAS still owes him a substantial sum of money which
he claimed to be unable to pay immediately because of the com-.
plete depletion of the Guatemalan Treasury by the deposed ARBENZ
Government.

 

BROWDER also stated very confidentially that he had
been contacted by leaders of a group which was organizing a revo-
lutionary attempt against the regime of Costa Rican President
JOSE FIGUERES FERRER and that he had been requested to obtain -
arms, equipment and to do staff work in connection with that:
revolution, In connection with the foregoing, T-3, of unknown
reliability, but who has furnished accurate information in the
past, and who is known to be closely associated with Costa Rican
revolutionary leaders, advised.categorically that the group had
no confidence whatsoever in BROWDER and that under no circum-
stances would they entrust him with funds or responsibility of
any kind in connection with a possible revolutionary attempt
against FIGUERES.

 

_ T-l advised that at the time of his arrest, BROWDER
had in his possession copies of several letters from one CHUCK -
AYLOR, 12h 1/2_S. Park Drive, Los Angeles, California, which
indicated an éxchange of communications between BROWDER and
TAYLOR relating to the possible sale of a "C-l7 airplane." In
this connection, BROWDER stated TAYLOR is an airlinés pilot whom
he had known when they were both flying for the Royal Airforce
during World War II and that he had intended to effect the sale
WA of 8 Cou? transport airplane which he claimed to “have access
yy to" in Nicaragua.

. Also in Subject's possession at the time of his ap-
prehension was a copy of a telegram from "Vision" magazine in
New York offering him a contract to write articles for that
