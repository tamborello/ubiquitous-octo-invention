SUBJECT: FBI/Secret Service Agreement
7 Byaaig __« NARS, DateSLV27
1. Attached, for your clearance, is a draft agreement between the FBI and the
Secret Service concerning Presidential protection; it is acceptable to both the
FBI and the Secret Service.

2. One point of interest appears on Page 2. Under the agreement, the FBI,

in connection with its responsibility to investigate subversive organizations,

", . . will be alert to and promptly notify the Secret Service of any information
indicating a possible plot against the person of the President. It can be argued
that more active verbiage would be preferable, which would make it the respon-
sibility of the FBI to actively dig for information regarding plots in subversive
organizations, The FBI, however, resists more active wording on the grounds
(a) that the FBI would have to redirect its whole investigative effort with respect
to subversive organizations to comply with more active verbiage and (b) that
such a large-scale redirection of effort is not called for.

 

Another point demonstrates the same sort of problem, In the last sentence of
Paragraph 2 on Page 2, it is made the responsibility of the Secret Service to
initiate action in the neutralization of a plot. While both the FBI and the Secret
Service want it this way, it can be argued that the initiative should be given to the
FBI, (In practical terms, it would seem to make little difference - in the event

of a plot against the President, the Secret Service would undoubtedly and quickly
call on the FBI for assistance, and the FBI would undoubtedly and quickly respond.)

 

3. Ithink we should approve the agreement. First, the FBI and the Secret Service,
_ who are the ones who have to live with it, favor the agreement, We should give it
a chance to work; if it doesn't, we can revise it. Second, the agreement is a long
step in the right direction. For one thing, some good work has been done in the
area of defining criteria for the identification of persons dangerous to the President.
For another thing, the process of hammering out the agreement has done much to
improve coordination between the Secret Service and the FBl at all levels. Third,
in practice, I don't think we need worry excessively about the general FBI reluc-
tance to dive deeply into the field of Presidential protection, The FBI is a good
organization, is now very sensitive to the high-level interest in Presidential pro-
tection, and, I think, will turn in a good performance. Ina related regard, I
worry far more about the performance of the Secret Service in doing its job; but
the core of the problem is the supervision of the Secret Service and, as such, is
beyond the scope of this agreement. |
