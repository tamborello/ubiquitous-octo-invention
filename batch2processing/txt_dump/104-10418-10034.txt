22 February 1968

QLTMANS interview of Jim GARRISON broadcast on NTS. It is not known
whether GARRISON travelled to The Hague or whether the show was taped
in the United States and sent on tape to Holland. The latter seems
probable, especially since the press did not report travel. outside the
United States hy GARRISON.

GARRISON calm and composed, was sufficiently credi-
ble to elicit rather favorable reviews from generally well-informed Dutch
newspapers. Several Dutch viewers also commenetd on the credibility of
his person and presnetation. It is likely that the NTS will try to sell
this program to other European countries.

 

GARRISON repeated well-known thesis that KENNEDY was the victim of

"President Kennedy was killed by elements of the Central
PnfdhiPd Shee Agency fof the United States Government."
