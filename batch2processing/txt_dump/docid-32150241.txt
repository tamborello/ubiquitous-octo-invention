.RE: LEE HARVEY OSWALD SS -
Absence of Payments to Oswald ; ; t “ROR be

Had any of our offices even made payments to him

jy the_receipts and vouchers submitted by each office, These
records have been checked and double checked and no such
; Payment was ever made. : .

 

Symbol Auabers Identifiable .

would be a matter of record not only by number but also by
name, AS a matter of fact, we can identify every ‘symbol

. number used, past or present. The number 179 supposedly
“assigned Oswald is currently used by the Dallas Office
for a criminal informant, Velma Yvonne Graham; a Negro madam
who runs a house of. prostitution. In New Orleans, where Oswald

.; Spent some time, the number 179 was used by the New Orleans

| Office back in 1941 to designate an informant, Joseph A,

: Partridge, who was reporting security information and who was
discontinued in 1944,- As previously noted, once a number is
used in any capacity, whether to designate a security or a
G texte informant, it cannot be used by ,the field. office again,
I

| , Had ‘Oswald been assigned a symbol number, this

n Mexico, to which Oswald traveled just prior to the assassi-
ation of President Kennedy, ‘our Legal Attache there currently
has a security informant 179 who was so designated in 1960,
He is Ignacio Olivo, who furnishes information on the Mexican-
Russian “oe of Cultural Exchange in Morelia, Michoacan,

Mexico. ] Ata (4) >

1 ‘Furthermore, Oswald could not have been assigned such
a symbol number witho a rv backer vestigation by any
field office considéring him for development, Had any field
office considered developing him, it would have had to obtain
approval by the SOG. There is no record of any such request
by any field office and no record of any such approval.
