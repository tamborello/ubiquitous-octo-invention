Mr. Baron. But that would be the person primarily
responsible for taking care of this double agent problem?

Mr. Hunt. That's correct.

Mr. Baron. Are you aware of what happened with that
suspected double agent?

Mr. Hunt. I have no idea because, as I may have indicated

| previously off the record, it became apparent some years later

that the unfortunate fate of our Albanian agents was linked
far more closely to the revelations of Kim Philby, the
Soviet agent who was in direct liaison with us in Washington
and in Great Britain, rather than any penetration, although
the possibility of a penetration was of course always there.
But I don't think that anybody was ever focused.

Again, I left for Latin American affairs. I left the

Division about that time and I really never heard about it

again. ( pememeeeneces) the Albanian chief, departed for

Southeast Asia, and the whole sort of complex of knowledgeable
people was broken up through normal transfers and special
activities like the Guatemala project.

Mr. Hunt. Very likely he was, yes. I don't think I
would have discussed anything with Colonel Pash about the

matter without talking tof about it.

Well, not being held, but where they

Mr, Baron, Can you explain the term "retainer"?

Mr. Hunt. Well, I understood that when he finally got
out of Albania, that he brought with him what I can best
describe as retainers. That is bodyguards, members of his
personal staff, probably some relatives. I think he had
four or five sisters with him. But the able-bodied portion

of those loyalists who came out with him we had largely taken

 

 

became apprehensive.

Se that was my interest in what was happening to the

Albanians that we parachuted ial i I had no

would have been handled and this was handled by the Chief
of Counter-espionage for the Division.
Mr. Baron, Who would that have been at the time?

Mr. Hunt. .I can't remember at this point.

in?

Mr. Hunt. I am not.

Mr. Baron. Does your answer include not only the period
i of time before you talked with Colonel Pash but after you
talked with Colonel Pash?

Mr. Hunt. Yes, sir.

I might add that I was rather briefly at CIA headquarters
at that time and within a very short period of time after I
had had my interview with Colonel Pash, I was transferred to the
Guatemala project, the overthrow of Guatemala.

Mr, Baron. Is that the reason why you did not follow up
on the problem with this particular suspected double agent
after not receiving satisfaction from Colonel Pash?

Mr, Hunt. That cearcainly could have been one reason.

On the other hand, I was chief of, I can see I'm really going

earlier, that when I first inquired around for the location of
Colonel Pash and his assistant, the reaction I encountered

was a rather jesting one, and the impression I gained was

“here were a couple of men who were drawing salaries and doing

very little.
And so when Colonel Pash seemed reluctant to become

involved in responding affirmatively to my questions, my

_inference was that Colonel Pash and{ | could well not

have such a capability but for purposes of employment and
status, this was the job they had. But they didn't want
anyone to call upon them to activate their particular
abilities.

Now that was my impression, and I was a little disgusted
by it. I think I talked to the Chief of the PP staff later,
who was of course well aware of the Albanian problem and I
said I didn't get any satisfaction from Pash, but it doesn't
really make any difference because we don't have the name
of the suspected individual.

Mr. Baron. Just to stop here for a second and clear up
some of these details, were you under the impression that what
you called wet affairs, assassinations, kidnappings, or other
removals from the scene of troublesome individuals was the

primary function of this unit that Pash and were

running?

Mr. Hunt. Yes. In fact the only. -As far as I knew, they

had no other function, If they had another function, I was

| never made aware of what it was.

Do you know anything about Colonel Pash's background?

 

Mr. Baron. I know a bit, but if you think that there are
relevant details to put on the background, go ahead.

Mr. Hunt. Well, I had not thought of Colonel Pash for
years until I began reading a book called "Lawrence and Oppen-

heimer," and I saw quite a few references to Colonel Pash, I

had known previously that he had been associated during the

| war with the Manhattan Project and that he had a security

 

background. And as I believe I touched on briefly before, it

was my impression that Pash had been active a couple of years

| at least before I knew him in West Germany with the sort of
!

| thing that we had been discussing so far today.

Mr. Baron. What kinds of stories had you heard about
Pash's previous activities?

Mr. Hunt. Kidnappings mostly.

Mr. Baren. And where were those?

Mr. Hunt. West Germany and West Berlin.

Mr. Baren. Do you know the names of any of the victims
of the kidnapping or any of the people involved other than
Pash and] |

Mr, Hunt. I do not.

Mr. Baron. And are you aware from whatever source of

any assassination planning or attempts that Pash was involved
