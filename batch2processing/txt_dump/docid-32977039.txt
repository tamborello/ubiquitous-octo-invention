FROM : SAIC Hanly, Paris PH? yu

SUBJECT: | Irmgard Roemer, FR Subject

This will confirm telephoned instructions from Inspector Peterson on the
evening of February 5, 1964 concerning the above captioned matter.

As instructed, I flew to Bonn the morning of February 7, 1964 to handle
this matter as per report attached,

No one on the security side at the Embassy in Bonn was aware of our presence
in Europe. When Inspector Thacker was here we discussed the possibility of
arranging for the State Department to notify all Embassies and Consulates
in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and to revise their present consulate
instructions, copy of which we obtained from the Consul General at Paris.

Actually, the instruction concerning counterfeiting should be unclassified,
Matters relating to our security interests could well be the subject of
another classified instruction which should provide that PR subjects of the
Roener jt ype , coming to the attention of the Missions, should be reported

o you through State Department channels and to this office as well.
