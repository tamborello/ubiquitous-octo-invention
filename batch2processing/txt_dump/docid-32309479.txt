evidence for a conviction to furnish this information to the state's
attorney so that a conviction could be obtained and that the FBI,
after he had been compromised by someone in the post office, said

that the Bureau had no jurisdiction, which angered Finegan.

Interpen is currently under an active neutrality matters
investigation by the Miami Office at the request of the Department.
Interpen is headed by Gerald Patrick Hemming and we are well aware

of his recent activities. This group was formerly known as the
Anticommunist Legionnaires. The members have reportedly been living
in the Everglades on snakes and swamp cabbage and have no housing.
Miami has an informant in the organization who is an aide to Hemming
and who has reported that the group consists of mercenaries, vagrants,
adventurers and unreliable delinquents with an average age of about
‘22 years. Informant stated the group seeks publicity; has no arms,
equipment or transportation; is not accepted in the Cuban revolutionary
movement; and informant does not anticipate any expedition by the
group. Recently this group engaged in parachute jumping in the Miami
area for publicity purposes.

A number of members-of Interpen have been arrested by local
authorities on charges of vagrancy. Local authorities have stated
these individuals have made a nuisance of themselves. One of those
arrested in July was an individual named George Williams. Finegan
advised the Subcommittee that he has used several names while
associated with Interpen, one of which is George Williams. The
George Williams who, Was arrested by local authorities was described
as a salesman. He, tated that he has asked the American Civil Liberties
Union to come to the defense of those individuals arrested since he
feels it is.a violation of civil rights. He said his group was not
attempting to violate United States neutrality statutes but he feels
that neutrality laws are immoral.

Vincent, Jos enblianaxa wad the subject of a Registration
Act - Cuba’ ca: recent past. He was a registered agent of the
Cuban Government until about one year ago. The Miami Office presently
has pending cases on him and his organization, known as the "Freedom
Fighters of the Americas" which is headed by Hanard. Hanard has
furnished information concerning his group, and investigation in
Miami as of June, 1961, failed to reveal that he is violating any
United States statutes.

  

Information concerning Interpen and Hanard received in the
past has been’ furnished to the Department and interested agencies.
