at 1612 K. Street, N.W., Washington,DC on 1 April 1959. Among .¢
those he represented at that tire were the Nicaraguan Covernment.
and Israeli Military Industries. Another undated card shows
him as a recistered representative of the Nicaraquan Government

reference to his buying rifles from the Dominican Pepi “lic for
sale to Indonesia, with the approval of the Nicaraguan president.

time enjoined from travelling to the Mid-Rast. ERWIG-1 was i
shown this passport Fy then - French Arbassador to Nicaragua, ,
Raymond PONS. EPWIG-1 told the Anerican Military’ Attache about
this unauthorized travel. The HA told the American Ambassador
who, in turn, told Davidson that FRWIG-1 had squealed on him.
