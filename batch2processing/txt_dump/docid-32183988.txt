MC 105-3702

It is noted that MARINA OSWALD identified the

bracelet as a gift. to her from her husband; that she stated
that the bracelet was given to her immediately after OSWALD
had veturned from New Orleans early in October, 1963;. and
‘that OSWALD had purchased a similar bracket for himself
with his name on it prior to the time they moved from
Dallas to New Orleans in the spring of 1963.

She stated that OSWALD wanted her to have a

' bracelet like his; that he had not stated where he bought |
the bracelet, and that she did not know he had gone to Mexico.

The lead for the Dallas office is set forth because

the above information presents the possibility that if OSWALD
bought a bracelet with his name on it prior to leaving Dallas
for New Orleans and since he wanted a similar one with his
wife's name on it, he purchased the second bracelet where

he purchased the first, probably in Dallas, Texas.
