lationship with: Czechoslovakia .

In one reapect the LGI (Cuban Intelligence service) has
a special relationship with Czechoslovakia. when a Cuban aational
or arent of other citizenship zoes through Prague, he must obtain
&@ Crechoslovas visa, For Gl staff and agent, Malsonu is con
ducted by “ALHELTA The azent submits to “ALLENTO" bis
Cuban aad own nationality passport, and “ALBEX TO" gets the
visa, «hen anagent arrives In frague, he is supposed to
telephone 6-9670, which is a Czechoslovax security service
number, The service arranges, when the ayent reports his name
and passport number, to meet huu somewhere, probably his
hotel; the Czechoslovax securit, service then picasa up the pass-
port at the meeting, Tha Cubans never see it Sgain and do not

Czechs may turn the passports over to the zoviets, bet the DGI

passports when they have deen picced up in Prague. since the
arranyenient dependa entirely oa the agent, it has some loopholes;
in some inatances agents have nut followed thelr lastructions, Dave
not telephoned the aumber in Prague, and have gone on their
further travels stili in possession of the Cuban’ passport issued them
in alias to get to Prague. In such cases there fs nothing the case
