Executive Director

Assassination Records
Review Board

600 E Street, NW

Washington, DC 20530

Dear David:

of documents. (U)

The memorandum distinguishes between stations that the

Agency is willing to acknowledge for specific dates, and
others that are considered too sensitive to divulge for even
a brief period. As soon as we obtain information on other
stations, this will also be forwarded to you for the Board's
consideration. (U)

The memorandum is intended to complement information
provided to the Board in earlier discussions on the subject
of the sensitivity of station locations. We welcome the
Opportunity to discuss this and other issues with the Board
and your staff. (U)

Sincerely,

John F. Pereira
