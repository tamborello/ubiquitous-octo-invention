Just prior to the reporting period, a telephone work crew disconnected
the LIFEAT lines routing the Yugoslav Embassy tap lines to the basehouse.
fhis was done at a point one-half mile from the basehouse and an equal dis-
tance from the target Embassy, and at a point where the tap routing was
"Jumped" from one telephone central's area to the central area serving the
basehouse. It was assumed the telephone crew would be curious as to the .
nature of these unusual connections, LIFSAP[_|therefore disconnected *

> (2) LIFEAT/Polish During the final weeks of
BEKNAVE's stay in Mexico, LIFEAT provided continuing support to the attempted
approach to BSXNAVE. This support included periods of "liveemonitoring” the
target lines to give early warning of B=XNAVE's exact departure plans as well
as the movements of BEKNAVE. LIP EAT also initiated coverage of the Polish
Commercial Office ‘in support of the interested Station officer's attempt to
gain more information on that installation and the personnel assigned therete.
