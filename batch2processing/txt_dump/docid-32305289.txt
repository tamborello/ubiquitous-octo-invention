ReTPlet to Bureau, dated 2/28/66, and to Miami,
dated 4/29/66.

Continued contact with TP 52-S, PSI

and TP 262-S has failed to reflect any organized
activity of captioned organization in the Tampa area.

   
   

On 5/27/66, TP _82-S advised SA WILLIAM E. OGLESBY
that the MIRR had no plghs to initiate any bombing activity
so far as was known the Tampa area. This source advised) E
that recently ENRIQUE ILLAN, Representative of the MI
in Tampa, had delivered a ‘letter to J
of. the local Spanish language ‘paper,/"Traduccion Prensa,"
containing a statement from ORL, CH, head of the M RR 3E
in Miami, to the effect that the M was not initiating 2 ’
in any new activity against the Cuban Government, but that
it had never ceased its activity in attacking the Cuban
Government. This statement, according to TP 52-S, was
made by BOSCH, in reply to an article appearing in "Diario
De Las Americas," Miami, some three weeks previous. to
receipt of the letter stating in effect that the MIRR was .
planning to renew its bombing attacks on Cuba. BOSCH .
stated that the MIRR had never stopped fighting for the ‘
freedom of Cuba. TP 52-S advised that the remarks of BOSCH
were never printed by the "Traduccion Prensa,"

   
 

Since the above article was never printed, this ‘
information is not considered of sufficient value to warrant '
dissemination.
