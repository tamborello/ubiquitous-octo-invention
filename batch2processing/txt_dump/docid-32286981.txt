and that it was not unusual that a local politician was
rewarded from some service to the mob by being slated for
a lucrative position such as a judgeship.

 

CG 6283-C advised SA VINCENT L. INSERRA on the
evening of 7/18/63 that he has heard that Judge AUSTIN
is a fairly close friend of BIEBER and BRODKIN and that
within the past year or so AUSTIN, BIEBER and BRODKIN
and their wives took a trip to either Miami or Las Vegas
and that the bills for this trip were paid by BIEBER and :
BRODKIN. . ;

In connection it is noted that CG 6576-C*
advised that on 4/2/63 MIKE BRODKIN advised PAT MARCY,
local politician who is the tool of Chicago topshoodlum
SAM GIANCANA, that Judge AUSTIN had sent him word that
, BRODKIN "must be mad at me" since it had been a period of
time since BRODKIN had visited AUSTIN.

CG 6283-C also advised that it is gossip in Chicago

on Clark Street where the federal courts are located that
for some time Judge AUSTIN has been having an affair with
| his secretary. According to this information, his secretary
: is a married woman, however, could furnish no additional information.
VA.
Se Ke CG 6283-C also advised that Judge AUSTIN and

GEORGEXLEIGHTON, the attorney-who is defending GIANCANA,

are pérsonally well acquainted with each other and were

very/closely associated together on a committee of the local
bar association which just recently sought changes in the
Criminal Code of Illinois. CG 6283-C, who is an attorney, i
advised that it appeared strange to him at the time that although
Judge AUSTIN was no longer a judge on a state or local
level, he seemed to have particular interest in the revisions
of the Illinois State Code and was the chairman of the committee
in this regard. This informant also noted that Judge AUSTIN
seemed to favor and fight for the proposed provisions of the new
code which hindered law enforcement in general. He stated in
! particular Judge AUSTIN was interested in having a part of the ‘
| code changed to make it mandatory that defendants be "immediately"
advised of their right to an attorney upon arrest and given
"immediate" access to a telephone to consult with an attorney.

Attention of the Bureau is also directed to the

\\ information that has previously been set out in my daily
\airtel summaries concerning the nt conversation

i between Municipal Judge..DANIEL ay ftean and PAT MARCY wherein

‘RYAN in spéaking about the fede; ‘al judges which he can

contact and presumabl¥ influence mentioned two of them

as being available to him in this regard and then said

"and, or course, Judge AUSTIN, I can always talk to."

This would indicate that at least Judge RYAN, known to

be under the considerable influence of MARCY and his

associates, felt that he had an entre with Judge AUSTIN.

. The DAPLI investigation of AUSTIN conducted in the
summer of 1961 when AUSTIN became a federal judge has been

_ reviewed and it is noted that CG 6132-C advised in 1/57 that
Judge RICHARD AUSTIN who at that time was a criminal judge
in Chicago accepted money to fix cases which he heard and that
he accepted this money through the law firm of Bieber and
Brodkin. It is noted that GEORGE LEIGHTON was interviewed
during this investigation and he advised that he had known -
AUSTIN on a professional basis for at least ten years.
LEIGHTON described AUSTIN as having more judicial ability
than any other judge in the local courts of Cook County, and
stated that he would highly recommend AUSTIN for the
position of federal judge. This report also shows that
AUSTIN was criticized in 1960 when AUSTIN was Chief Justice
of the Criminal Courts for an attempt to destroy a special

Grand Jury report on the police scandals "as part of a sinister /
plan to cover up corruption in Chicago". It is noted that this /
corruption greatly hindered Chicago hoodlums due to the reorganization
of the Chicago Police Department. This report indicated that /

' the Grand Jury believed that there was an alliance in Chicago between
crime politicians and the police. AUSTIN explained, according
to the press, that the jury exceeded its authority in making. i
Lo such a report. States Attorney ADAMOWSKI accused AUSTIN's| ;
| : “polities of the cheapest king" and referred to him as a — i
is "CHARLIE MC CARTHY" to Mayor DALEY's "EDGAR BERGAN" of the
Democratic organization. It should also be noted that 7 |
; this investigation determined that AUSTIN is a former law partner
. of ex-governor DWIGHT GREEN of Illinois and that AUSTIN ran
: - as a Democratic candidate for governorr of Illinois in 1956.
