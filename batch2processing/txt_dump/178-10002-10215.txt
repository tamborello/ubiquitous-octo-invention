: * A Well, Let's see. I would say that was probably around
3 2 1965 because Fitzgerald then became Chief, W.H., and then
i & | later DDP.
i 4 Q Now, Mr.Harvey -- do you recall what position Mr. |
5 ' Harvey held after he left Task Force W?
é A Yes. He was:Chief of Station, , !
” Q And is he still with the Agency?
8 A Oh, no. He retired a long time ago. !
g is) Do you know where he lives at the present time?
1¢ A Frankly, I don't, I have an idea where he lives.
lz He went to work for a friend of mine who had a law firm.
y 12 Harvey is a lawyer.

i ja A Yes, some place around there. Et is in the midwest, |

20° lished? . |
: 21 A Well, I think they had a forward operatio-s base down

: * Special Activities Staff. It was headed by Desmond Fitzgerald.
F ° i And then, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations
: ° | Group. .
: 6 : Q Mow, was this a special group within the DDO or was
° it attached to one of the area divisions?
6 A No. Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing
? called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And
8 that -- when Harvey left, he went to @hief of Station,{ |
9 and Fitzgerald took over, it became special Activities Staff.
16 . It wasn't attached to anything except -- it reported to the
++ Deputy Director, Plans.
i 12 Q And that was Mr. Karamessines?
: is. A Yes. Well, it was Helms at that time back when it
2 14 was first created. Helms was DDP at that time.
35 Q And Task Force W was created immediately after the
16 _ + Bay of Pigs? -
i7 oA Well, not immediately. I think sometime around --
18° in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in

19 September, something like that, 1961.

: 22 ° . A Special Activities Staff and consequently became the

And what was the date of that reorganization?
