by MALLAMO not to drive his car.to the Workingmen's Club, but

to either walk or take a taxi, and there would be a car available
to him, parked in the rear of the Club, for the informant to use.

left the Club and returned in about. 20 minutes. Informant

stated there must have been some kind of a disagreement at-

the time which caused the canoslistion of the trip to Campbell.

‘War in the past, but that's a11 dead and gone, and you are my
paison now." CV 278-C TE stated DELSANTER referred to years ago
when he operated the National Gigarette Co. with JASPER JOSEPH .

one cf us now," and indicated to the informant that there was
supposed to be some more money to come in that did not arrive,,.
or that was not made available by MALLAMO to DELSANTER, and that
was the disagreement. CV 278-C TE stated he asked DELSANTER why
& barbut game could net open, and DELSANTER replied, “There's
teo many FBIs around, you know that, we're surrounded. There
are FBI men.in Warren like flies, and the FBI has an office
there. with at least 2O men. All cf us they've got something
on, but they can't pin it on us. but you, you're clean." Informant
stated he did not know what DELSANTER was referring to.

yersation with PAPALAS, PAPALAS told him he has nothing going for
him at present except that he picks up a few numbers bets, and

dees & small amount of booking on his home telephone. DELSANTER
told the informant that he only has one poker game going for him
in Warren and Trumbull County at the present time, and that he. .
cannot get near the Trumbull County Sheriff, and it is for this
reason he is going to do everything in his pewer to attempt to
