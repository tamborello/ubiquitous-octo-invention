"Die Weltwoche" has the reputation of having seen better days,
‘and of tending toward sensationalism at -present.

The articles make allegations as follows:

1. The Watergate scandal has shown that certain American
politicians are capable of any crime. Therefore, the
contention that OSWALD was the sole murderer of Pres.
KENNEDY finds less credence than ever.

  
 
   
   
 
  
 
   
  
   
 
   
        

The film, "Executive Action" seeks to prove that Pres.
KENNEDY was the victim of a right radical conspiracy.

Pres. KENNEDY's body was the subject of a deficient
examination by an unqualified physician.

The fact that Pres. KENNEDY intended to reduce the
American engagement in South Vietnam is the real.
reason for his assassination.

’
e

The investigation was restricted to proving the
sole guilt of OSWALD, because otherwise it would
have taken too much time and money.
