LA 4396-C* has furnished information that
ROSSELLI has been in contact with a girl believed to be
SHARON ANN JOHNSON, on several occasions during the past
four or five days. According to this informant, this
girl planned to spend the past week end in Las Vegas, Nevada
and to return to Los Angeles on Sunday evening 1/6/63.

It has been learned that SHARON ANN JOHNSON has
service with Call Nina, Inc., a telephone answering service.
Check of her calls beginning 11/1/62 reveals several calls
from MAURICE FRIEDMAN, but none from ROSSELLI. However,
she received a number of calls from a man who would refuse
to leave his name or telephone number and these could well
be calls from ROSSELLI. On 1/4/63, SHARON's brother,
left a message for her to call him when she returned from
Las Vegas. ° :

LA 4268-C advised ROSSELLI was at the Friar's
Club in Beverly Hills on the afternoon of Friday, 1/4/63
and was with IRVING J. LEFF, part-owner of the New Frontier
Hotel, Las Vegas.

This informant also observed ROSSELLI at the
Friar's Club on the afternoon of 1/7/63 playing cards.
Informant was at the club from about 4:15 p.m. until
5:55 p.m. During this time he observed MOE GENSER, Chief
Investigator for the Department of Motor Vehicles, Los
Angeles, California, approach ROSSELLI and hand ROSSELLI
a note which ROSSELLI took and:pat into his pocket. As
he handed the note to ROSSELLI, GENSER said, "Here's that
thing you wanted."

Examination of ROSSELLI's bank account in
December, 1962 revealed that on 11/24/62 he issued a check
for $100 payable to "Friar's Charity Foundation", the name
"S, DAVIS" was written on the face of the check. ‘The back
of the check bore the endorsements of "M, GERSER or GENSER"
and "J, ROSELLI." Neither 8S. DAVIS or GENSER are known
to be officers of the Frair's Club. —
