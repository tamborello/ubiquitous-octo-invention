"MINUTEMEN"

This memorandum is supplemental to previous memoranda
dated ~ January 22, 1965, and February 17, 1965.

DL T-l advised on March 16, 1965, there has been
little recent activity of the group in Fort Worth, Texas,
aligned similarly to the "Minutemen" organization. The group's
plans to burglarize a local National Guard Armory have not ‘
materialized, as recently the group has noticed further security
precautions, including night lighting, are being taken at
armories.

 

“Ray”, who appears to be the highest group official
in the area, is speaking more of retired General Edwin Walker 's
guidance and leadership of the organization.. He speaks in near
reverent terms concerning Walker. DL T-1 advised that “Ray"
was arranging a meeting with General Walker for him, but after
further consideration, decided it would not be appropriate
at this time, because Walker becomes suspicious of those who
too quickly attempt to meet him. "Ray" advised that it would
-be wiser to wait until the General requests to see him -or
until he had been in the organization a longer period of time.

_ DL T-1 further stated that William Seals of Houston,
Texas, formerly of Fort Worth, has not been recently in
contact with the group in Fort Worth. . \

DL T-1 advised he had no information that the group
had yet established a lecal storehouse or arsenal for weapons
and that. the membership and leaders in the lecal group have
remained unchanged,
