IX. ALLEGATION BY crineeto NOLASCO ALVARADO UGARTE

'. “The first. confidential source abroad adiviged that
on November 25, 1963, GILBERTO NOLASCO ALVARADO UGARTE, a
Nicaraguan citizen born January 31, 1940, in Ciudad Rama,
Departamento Zelaya, Nicaragua, made contact with the United
States Embassy at Mexico, D. F., and advised the following: -

~ ALVARADO entered Mexico illegally from Guatemala on
August 29, 1963, traveled to. Mexico, D..F., and subsequently
made contact with EDELBERTO TORRES, a Nicaraguan communist
residing in Mexico City. From this contact a plan was
developed for ALVARADO to travel to Cuba to study guerrilla ;
warfare tactics. He had octasion to visit the Cuban Consulate.
in Mexico, D. F., several different times for the purpose of
obtaining travel docunientation for Cuba by furnishing false .
identification papers as a Mexican citizen. : ;

ALVARADO claimed’ that the real purpose ‘behind his”
proposed travel to Cuba was a penetration mission for the :
Nicaraguan Secret Service. He stated that on September 18,
1963, he went to the Cuban Consulate, and while sitting in
the waiting room saw a group of approximately eight persons
enter the Consulate and the office of Cuban Consul EUSEBIO
AZCUE. A person unknown to him was sitting at AZCUE's. desk. -
A short time later, while ALVARADO was standing near the door
to the men's room at the Cuban Consulate, he noticed three
men conversing a few feet away from him. One of them was a
tall, thin Negro with reddish hair; the second was a man whom
ALVARADO had seen previously holding a Canadian passport .in
the waiting room of the Cuban Consulate; and the third person,
according to ALVARADO, was LEE HARVEY OSWALD. mo

. : . '

C2

ALVARADO stated that a tall Cuban joined the above
group momentarily and passed some United States currency to
the Negro. | .

. The following conversation between the , Negro and
OSWALD was overheard by ALVARADO;

 

Negro (in English): I want to kill the man.

OSWALD: You're not man enough. I can do it.
