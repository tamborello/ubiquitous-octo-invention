CUBA PLANNING

1. The basic operational war plans to overthrow the Castro
government and gain essential control of Cuba envisage an air attack
on Cuba followed by an invasion.

2. Air Attack Plan, The air attack plan, CINCLANT OPLAN 312,
provides for attacks on selected targets to eliminate the effective capa-
bilities of the Cuban air force and to reduce the capabilities of Cuban
ground and naval forces, The Plan calls for the selective destruction
of Cuban military targets, in graduated degrees of severity. The
planned options thus range from the destruction of only a single surface-
to-air missile (SAM) site, through the destruction of a few SAM sites
and some airfields, to a full-scale air attack against all major targets.
Prior to initiation of these air actions, or as.they commence, non~
combatants will be evacuated from Guantanamo, and the base will be
reinforced to improve its defensive capabilities.

3. The full implementation of the air attack plan can be initiated
on 72 hours notice, and will involve nearly 600 Navy, Air Force, and
Marine aircraft. Some options of the plan which require selective
application, of smaller forces can be initiated in as few as six hours in
an emergency. . :

4, Invasion Plan, The invasion plan, CINCLANT OPLAN 316,
calls for the invasion of Cuba as soon as possible after directed with
the objective of gaining essential control of Cuba. A simultaneous
airborne/amphibious assault will be made in the Havana area to seize
key objectives, The attached chart shows the concept of operations,
Subsequent operations will be conducted as necessary, Again this plan
also calls for the reinforcement of Guantanamo and for the evacuation
of non-combatants before combat operations begin, Also, prior to the
assault, CINCLANT OPLAN :.312, as described above, will be fully
implemented to help prepare the way.

5. The build-up for this operation normally will require 18 days,
if no alerting actions have been taken. With prepositioning of military
forces, and transport resources, this reaction time can be reduced to
7 days. Since the availability of shipping is a critical Hmiting factor,
to achieve the reduced response would require requisitioning and
prepositioning of commercial vessels.

6. The invasion forces may total some 266,000 US military
personnel, depending upon the degree of Cuban resistance, Of
these forces, 121,000 would come from the Army; 70,000 from
the Navy; 24,000 from the Air Force; and 51,000 from the Marines,

7. The Joint Chiefs of Staff would like to review these plans
with the President and discuss any questions he may. have.
