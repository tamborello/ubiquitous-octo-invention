UNDERWOOD so far as he knew was not a paid Agent of the Cuban
Government; that UNDERWOOD indicated he resides in New York
City, but HERNANDEZ claimed to possess no information further
concerning UNDERWOOD.

HERNANDEZ also confidentially advised that
JESUS ESTRADA, who has been working as an informant for
HERNANDEZ in Miami, has been ordered by CARLOS PRIO to proceed
to Mexico City and to establish contact with CANDIDO de la
TORRE at 125 Solis Street, Colonia Churrusbusco, Mexico City,
Mexico, D. F. for the purpose of preparing to participate in
a@ revolutionary invasion of Cuba to be launched from Florida.
HERNANDEZ said that ESTRADA is travelling by Greyhound Bus Line
and is scheduled to have left Miami at 9:45 AM; Sturday, July 6,
1957, although he has not been able to definitely confirm
ESTRADA's departure. He will enter Mexico at Laredo, Texas.
He is supposed to obtain a Mexican Visa at New Orleans, Louisiana,
Prior to his departure; JUAN ORTA, who is closely associated
with PRIO and who is the subject of a separate perjury case
based upon false testimony which ORTA gave during January, 1957
Grand Jury proceedings, Miami, gave ESTRADA a ticket and $25.

in cash, PRIO, according to HERNANDEZ, gave ESTRADA an additional {

$50, in eash and PRIO is also supposed to furnish ESTRADA's wife,
who is supposed to remain in Miami, with $50. every 15 days or so,

instructed ESTRADA to sew this money in the belt line of his
trousers or some. suitable place to be used for emergency only.

in all revolutionary preparations up to the time that. the :
revolutionists are scheduled to board a boat or plane, at which nonent
ESTRADA shoill then use his emergency fund for immediate trans-
portation to the nearest city from which point he. should ;
immediately contact HERNANDEZ. HERNANDEZ said that he also .
expects to receive progress reports from ESTRADA prior. to the :

date of fina departure,
