MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT ‘: Project KDAFGHAN Termination

1. A request for termination action is contained in
paragraph four, herein.

2. Project KDAFGHAN is a Support project which provides
the Mexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical
surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.

known leaders of extremist groups in the U.S. as well as with
photographs of persons who are subjects of identification
orders prepared on badly wanted fugitives in the U.S.), it is
of little value, as presently constituted, to Mexico Cit
Station. There are other means of obtaining photographs of
PCS and TDY Cuban personnel.

4. In early 1972 the Station mounted a thorough CI review
of all Cuban operations in an attempt to improve their overall
security. Although KDAFGHAN-1 passed the SGSWIRL with no

danger presented by his and KDAFGHAN-2's Cuban relatives made ~~
