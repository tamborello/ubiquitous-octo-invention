“morally repr-iensible”? and “shows a
lack of respect for law.”

He cited the break-ins of homes of -

Socialists Workers Party members by

the FBI without warrants, and of the re-

ported “organizing of Klaverns of the

Ku Klux Klan” in North Carolina in an

attempt to weaken the influence of exist-
_ ing Klan groups. .

But, said Morgan, many were not
aware that “the Rey. Mr:-Dorsett, who’
was on the Fisl payrell at the time,
spoke in a most inflammatory manner-at
one of the largest Klan rallies in the
state.”

The Senator quoted Doisett «s saying,
at a Raleigh Klan meeting in 1966, “We
don’t intend {o have any violence if we
have to kill every nigger in America.”

Commented Morgan, “For an FBI ine
formant {o act in this way is most im-
moral. It sets tace against race and is a
prelude (o Jawiessness.”

He also cited the FBI's writing of an-
onymous letters {6 individuals “in an ef-
fort to break up their marriages.”

_ | In one such case, he said, the FBI
. wrote the wife ofa Klansman that her
husband “‘had taken the flesh of another
unto himself,” and in another letter to
the husband of a peace activist, wrote
that “your old lady doesnt get enough
at home or she wouldn't, be shucking

Said Morgan, “Apparently our

“tions in these cases, saying, “All of this

‘out with the excuse that it was in the in-

. | INFORMATIVE NOTE
bate. 4/19/76

Attached "Greensboro Daily News,"'
Greensboro, North Carolina, newspaper
article advises that U. S. Senator Robert

organ of North Carolina has publicly
identified George Dorsett of Greensboro @
an FBI klan informant. (Dorsett was (
previously identified by the "Greensboro
Daily News" as an informant which disclosur
at that time was attributed to an unnamed
source on the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence (SSC) of which Senator Morgan
is a member. Dorsett was in fact a klai. |
informant from 1/59 to 10/70 and documents
delivered to the SSC, when compared with
each other, do identify Dorsett as an
informant. His informant status has not
been publicly acknowledged by the Bureau
or Dorsett.)

 

Senator Morgan also reportedly said
that the list of illegalities by the
Internal Revenue Service, Central Intelli-
gence Agency and the FBI was "frightening, |!
‘morally reprehensible" and "shows a lack
of respect for law,'' all done in the name
of national security which "became the
catch-all for illegal activity."
