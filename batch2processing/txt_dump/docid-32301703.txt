RE: IGNACIO ROBERTO NOVO SAMPOL

 

RIVERO explained that about two years ago, he met
for the first time with DIONISIO SUAREZ, but has had no
further contact with him.

RIVERO claimed that IGNACIO NOVO responds to the
activities of the CNM in the New Jersey area and is not
associated with the CNM membership and activities in the
Miami area.

MM T-2, a Cuban exile who is associated with
CNM activities in the New Jersey area, on.Sevtember 24,
1976, advised that on September 16, 1976, the Russian
ship "Ivan Shepetkov" at Elizabeth, New Jersey, was bombed
by an explosive device. MM T-2 felt that GUILLERMO NOVO
was behind the bombing and the possibility existed that -
IGNACIO NOVO was in New Jersey during that period of tine UW)

On October 18, 1976, FELIPE RIVERO DIAZ was
interviewed by WQBA, a Spanish language radio station
in Miami. RIVERO said that recently an article appeared
in El Nacional, a daily newspaper published in Caracas,
Venezuela. The article alleged that IGNACIO and GUILLERMO
NOVO were involved in the assassination of the ex-Chilean
Ambassador to the United States, ORLANDO LETELIER, which
took place on September 21, 1976. a i

RIVERO ‘stated that terrorist acts of which he clA
and CNM membérs have been accused, stem from a boek-written
by CARLO IVERO¥COLLADO, a Cuban exile in Miami /who defected

‘ to Cuba~in Novémber, 1974, RIVERO denied_that—he or the

NOVO brothers had anything to do with LETELIER's assassina-

- tion.
