6. [KASSEL's draft report to his Soviet contact in
Bogota is a single-spaced nine-page paper entitled "Composicion
Politica de la Emigracion Cubana en Miami, Florida." It
covers those groups with which KASSEL has become most
familiar: the PRP, the MIRC, Alfa 66, and several other
minor groups. Following are highlights of that report f(s)

A. [in response to a specific requirement from
KASSEL's Soviet contact to determine if U.S. Government
agencies, including specifically the CIA, support any of
these groups, KASSEL makes emphatically clear in his report
that none of the exile groups have the support of the U.S.
Government, although some groups falsely claim to have such
support. He points out that the U.S. Government not only
ignores the political exiles, but places high priority on
its relations with the USSR and is "disposed" to lift the
blockade of Cuba and reestablish relations with Havana.
In connection with the latter point, KASSEL reports on his
interview with Dr. Alberto DIAZ Masvidal, Director of the
Spanish edition of Miami Herald, who told KASSEL that
reestablishment of U.S. - Cuban relations is now inminent ]6)

B. garding on-island operations of Cuban exile
groups, {KASSEL oncludes that none of them have any operational
contacts in a.

C.\jRegarding terrorism, [KASSE reports that
Dr. Orlando OSCH, a fugitive from the U.S. who now Javes

in Venezuela under an assumed identity, and Antonio VECIANA,

a founding member of the PRP who is now in prison, have a ~
plan of attack against Cuban embassies and consulates and
against Soviet Bloc missions in Latin America, to be put

into effect when Venezuela, Costa Rica, and other unidentified
countries reestablish relations with Cuba. He also singles
out Jose de Jesus<QINQAUMA, a Cuban political gangster who
last year planned an attack against a Soviet family in
Venezuela, and the Frente Unido de Liberacion, which was
formed this month “in Miami and which announced the launching
of a terrorist campaign against Cuban and Soviet Bloc
diplomatic installations in the entire Western Hemisphere.

Intelligence Services are aware of his plans and that he has

no difficulty in their implementation. Participants at

the meeting were then asked to contribute funds for the

urchase of weapons; the total cash raised exceeded $1,000.00.
(9 SSEL| commented that it is his impression that the funds

raised were intended for MASFERRER's personal use rather

than the purchase of weapons.

D. [kassei\discussed with Ramiro de LA FE the
possibility of founding a conspiratorial. and secret political
movement to create a mechanism of penetrating Cuba for the
purpose of contributing to conditions which would result in
a military coup against Castro. The movement would be
headed "in absentia" by Ernesto de-£A FE, who had been
released from prison in Cuba two months ago. The decision

| to launch this movement was made on 25 August in the apart-
ment of iro de LA FE. resent at that time, in addition
to {KASSEDAnd Ramiro dex Fe, were ArmandgEDINA, Manuel
_-CAVEDAS and Miguel A.~ZERQUEIRA (Cubans) and Juan.-LOP
(maturalized American). The new movement was named-Movimiento
Independente.Radical de Cuba (MIRC) and Ramiro de LA FE con
waS named its temporary leader until such time as Ernesto
de LA FE can leave Cuba. The MIRC will seek contact with
Cuban armed forces to launch a coup against Castro and it
will aiso seek contact with anti-Communist groups in Brazil
and with the government of Chile. Rami de LA FE claimed
already to have contact with Patricia’ ERDUGO, a Chilean
supposedly working for the Chilean Intelligence Service in
Miami. During the meeting, Armando MEDINA said that he
had once worked for CIA and that he participated in an
attack on a Spanish merchant vessel which was mistaken for
the Sierra Maestra of the Cuban Merchant Fleet. (KASSEL ](s)

as a "farsante." Ss
