} Their ‘selection evolved both from the Committee! s

independent field investigation and the examination,

of the files and records maintained by the federal

‘activity. These agencies included local police departments,
the FBI, the CIA, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs (now the DEA), the Customs Service, the Iimigration

and Naturalization Service, and the Department of Defense.

 

(3) These groups canbe described as “action groups."
These were the movements most active on bott the
military and propaganda . fronts, the meget not
only talked about anti-Castro operations, but actually
carried out infiltrations and raids into Cuba, conducted
Castro assassination attempts, participated ina
multiplicity of arms dealings and possessed the most
vociferous and aggressive leaders. These were the
groups and individuals who received the crux of the
Kennedy Administration's crackdown on anti-Castro
operations following the Cuban missile crisis. These
were also the ones who, in the end, were the most

bitter at President. Kennedy and felt the most

() Two: primary reasons prompted the Committee to
investigate anti-Castro activists and organizations.
First, the Committee ascertained that as a consequence

of the failure and eventual unwillingness of the Kennedy

Administration to liberate Cuba from Castro, ‘these persons

and organizations,.bmeing located primarily in the .

United States, amd highly militaristic in nature.) possessed

the means, motive, and opportunity to assassinate the

President. Second, the Committee felt that Lee Harvey

Oswald's verified association with anti-Castro .

involvement of anti-Castro elements inthe assassination.
For these reasons, the Committee thoroughly investigated
numerous anti-Castro organizations and operatives

and Oswald's activitna while living-in New Orleans to
determine their connection, if any, to the assassination.

groups included Alpha 66, JURE, Commandos L, the
Directorio Revolutionario Estudiantial (DRE), the Cuban
Revolutionary Council (CRC), which includes the Frente

Cuba in Exilo (JGCE), the 30th of November, the .

International “Penetration Forces (InterPen),
