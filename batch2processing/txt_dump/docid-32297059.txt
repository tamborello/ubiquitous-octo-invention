race track, which, of course, would be construct
Webb Corporation. ROSSELLI stated to DALITZ that a
BREEN with the Del Webb Corporation in Arizona had ap
made the request.

 

 

Mr. BREEN of the Del Webb Corporation, of course,
would be identical with JOSEPH BREFN's brother, and it is
known that JOSEPH BREEN's brother is a vice president with
Del Webb Corporation and resides in Phoenix.

DALITZ stated he told ROSSELLI he would under no
circumstances made a recommendation to the Las Vegas Resort
Hotel Association relative to construction of the sports
car race track and as a matter of fact the Desert Inn Hotel
had prior plans for the construction of a smaller sports
car race track in Paradise Valley near the Paradise Valley
Golf Course. This race track would be financed and operated
solely by the Desert Inn.

DALITZ again expressed his extreme dislike of
ROSSELLI, but stated that in view of his position, he has
to meet and talk with people of ROSSELLI's stature in life,
but that he has thus far been able to keep them at an arm's
length.
