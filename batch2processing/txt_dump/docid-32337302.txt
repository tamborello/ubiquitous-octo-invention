: There are enclosed herewith two boxes containing
photographic copies of the material which had been madé ‘available
to CIA, These enclosures were furnished to the Liaison Agent
on October 20, 1960, by S. H. Horton, CIA, It is his under-
standing that another package of photographs is being transmitted
to CIA Headquarters by the Agency's representative in namie Auh

 

Al

. Horton advised that contrary to his earlier understanding,
material was not. disseminated to our Miami Office because the CIA

the National Security Agency 6) : .
