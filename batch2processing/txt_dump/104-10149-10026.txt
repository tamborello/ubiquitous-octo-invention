Dear Bob:
Herewith are comments on the Nosenko draft.

In commencing, it should be noted that Tennent Bagley remains
under cover, retired abroad. We are obliged to honor that cover,
which he has not moved to have modified. To expose his true
status as a former CIA employee could have repercussions in his
present situation that we must accept as significant. When he . >
was here in November 1978, he was advised of steps necessary” :
to remove his cover, in the event he decided to go overt: in this
matter; he took no steps to alter his cover status. It remains
classified. We therefore request that the example set in the
Hart testimony, of referring to Mr. Bagley by the title of Deputy
Chief, SB Division, be followed in this draft. ; os

Following are detailed comments:
