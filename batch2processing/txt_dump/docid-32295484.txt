recovered and fled the country. he assassination was allegedly
at PROFACI's orders.

The 1937 Newark City Directory lists a DOMENICO.
D'AMICO as Director of the D'Amico Macaroni Company, 34, Drift
Street, Newark. GASPARE is listed as President of this ‘company.

Newark files also show that on 1/24/58, Lt. LEON

" NEIDORF made available Essex County Prosecutor's Office murder

files, number 247, 248 and 249. These files showed that
VINCENZO TROIA, his stepson, JOSEPH TROIA, and FRANK LONGO,

of 109 North 15th Street, Bloomfield, New Jersey, were murdered
at 10:57 AM, 8/22/35, in a candy store located at 317 South

6th Street, Newark, x. J.

An article appearing in the "Newark Evening News"
on 8/23/35 noted that VINCENZO TROIA was reported to be the
operator of the Two Eagles Italian lottery, one of four such
lotteries operated in the City of Newark. The bodies of ‘
VINCENZO and JOSEPH TROIA were claimed by Brooklyn undertaker,
CHARLES C, CATALANO, and were shipped to Italy for burial,

The above information is submitted to assist in the
evaluation of that furnished by NY T-2 in referenced report,
7/1/63, Although informant's information concerning the fact
that D*AMNICO and the TROIAs met violent deaths is substantially
correct, it does not appear that TROIA could have been
responsible for D'AMICO's death since TROIA was himself killed
eighteen months earlier.

Cases have been opened to identify and determine .
the activities of Dr, PHILIP NOTO, DANNY NOTO, FRETCHIE (LNU),
and HAPPY (LNU) (believed to be JOSEPH BELLINO) , all reported
by NK 2319-C* to be members or potential members of Cosa
Nostra.
