Re: Assassination Records Review Board Request for Additional Information and
Records No. CIA-11 (Sylvia Duran materials)

Dear John:

We would like to request all files, documents, and records that relate to Sylvia Duran’s
first arrest and interrogation in Mexico City immediately following the assassination.
We have seen many references in documents to Sylvia Duran’s “ten-page statement”
that she gave to the Mexican police, but we have not been able to locate the statement
itself. We consider this record important in understanding events pertaining to Oswald
in Mexico City.

For your convenience, we have attached several of the documents from the collection
that reference the statement. We request that you locate this original statement and any
other records that provide any information regarding the statement.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

(VU
