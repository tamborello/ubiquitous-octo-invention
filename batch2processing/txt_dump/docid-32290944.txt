by the informant, TRAFFICANTE, and BRADY, TRAFFICANTE agreed
to consider arranging financing for the gambling.ship and in-
structed the informant to give him more Specific details,

a suitable ship. They also discussed the possibility of con-
structing a hotel in Martinique, and Escott entered into this
discussion, TRAFFICANTE, however, was not agreeable to this
