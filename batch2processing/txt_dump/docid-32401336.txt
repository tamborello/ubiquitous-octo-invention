“ a. Pamphlets and posters

bitterly lampooning Nasir, espe-
tee cially for his involvement in Yemen
and Algeria, have appeared on the
streets of Cairo and Suez.

of organized opposition.

d. We do not consider Nasir
to be in any immediate danger of
overthrow, though he could be forced
to modify unpopular policies if the
discontent spreads.

It will probably contain some "mild"
