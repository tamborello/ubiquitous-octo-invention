It was explained to him by the informants,that :
the [Ad Hoc Committee Porks from withingthe cp, usAkhoe 7
past history has shdwn that splinter groups have generally

‘faded from the scene; further, that in order to make
progress, the (Aa Hoc Committe ust capture the heritage
and traditions of ¥the Cp, us t was explained that should
at some time in the future the Ad Hoc on ttoePhonbers ;
become expelled fromgt he regular Part wthat that time,

. €ven though the membership is small, they would be willing

and able to undertake the principled fight aga ins tfUn itd

e fight forfa rxist-Leninist Part n this country.
iThey informed LOMA hat e though there have been minor
‘difficulties betweenXCHAS the JAd Hoc Committeé[# tha

“as a result of our recent lleti the {Negro cues tof
a group on the West Coast had cong ulated us a making’ ’a
valuable contribution on this question. LOMA capa

.. that no one has all the answers on the {Negro questio
- that we are not making any urilateral claims to the solution

of this problem t rather are presentin he thoughts of the
d Hoc Committee}tiembers in ene ggAg orden to invoke

' comments and criticisms from our readers.

) .

LOMA hoted that the recent activities of the
Progressive Labor Party (PLP) have left him with the
impression that this group was tending to be "too Trotskyite",
He stated that he was very concerned with this organization. .
The informants’ onl comments here were to the effect that '
the [aa Hoc Connittelphas no relationship with the PLP. ()

. The contact be tween§LOMAN and the informants was
extremely cordial and he invited them to return to his
home on any océasion so desired by them. He stated that he
would like to have them see his. films on China, which he
felt they would enjoy. He again stated that he had no
contacts in the Chicago area and was very pleased that
they would stop to see him. (y(n. ; .

It is apparent from the reception given to the
informants by. LOMAN tha e continues to be interested
in the[Ad Hoc Committee Sha eat he accepts the informants
as trusted Marxist- Lentnistg]@? )Further, there has been no
ndication since first nists in July that LOMAN has
violated the security of our informants CW)

In view of the“fact that LOMAN has been in

‘ contact with SUE JE WARREN “FRANK and that FRANK is reputed to
be the Chinése “paymaSter” in this county as well as a close
contact of PLP, it is felt his remark concerning this organization

_ [that a it is tending to become "too Trotskyite" is significanCy (vw

“. not only to promote finances for thefAd Hoc CommitteeP but to
gain his trust and confidence to the extent that we 1
be in a position to determine more information about. his
‘relationship with the PLP and SUE FRANKCW)

aN UACB, infrequent contacts will be made teesfie t
1

. As his comment concerning the PLP is an indication.
that FRANK may be disenchanted with this_organization also,
it would be well for the {Ad Hoc Committee 2° continue to
develop the confidence of LOMAN. this’frespect, New York is

_ requested to ad#ise if there has nm any apparent change in

- SUE FRANK's association with the PLP. Further, if available,

' New York is’ requested to advise if. FRANK continues to maintain™
contacts with the same individuals as she had prior to July,
1965. Chicago also requests any information relating to ~

' FRANK's overseas travels, which had been _Sontemplated during.
the may 1965, period. .
