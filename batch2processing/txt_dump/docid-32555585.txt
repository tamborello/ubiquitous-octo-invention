loating hotel-casino,off the island of Aruba, Netherlands Antilles,
which necessitateg-minister of justice a val. DINO's brother,
EDWARD GOFFREDSKCELLINI, and one. ROSARIPPSPADARO, are currently
wegotiating to purchase the Grea ay*Hotel in St. Maarten, Nether- _.
lands Antilles (Bufiles 182-3468 and 163-37211; CARfiles 182-I and
92-10). RSO, Mr, MARTINEZ, and Legat suspect the floating casino

and the hotel may well be schemes to launder LCN money through the
Netherlands Antilles.

On the last attempt to contact subject and his wife, RSO
and MARTINEZ were told by NAPF authorities that the minister of
justice considered subject's contract to be indefinite, and further,
that no attempt to contact subject should: be made in the future,
and refused to state where subject was currently located, Attempts
to contact subject thrdugh his family in. Caracas have been negative.

 

It appears unlikely that Netherlands Antilles authorities
would have placed subject in isolation merely in order to prevent
him from accepting a position with the U. S. Embassy in Caracas.
However, because of subject's high-level contacts in government
circles in the Netherlands Antilles, he could possibly have come
into possession of information concerning corruption or political
intrigue that would make it advisable forthem to keep him in
Curacao if at all possible. .

 

Both RSO and Mr, MARTINEZ strongly feel that subject's
disappearance is directly connected with his intention to take a
position with the U. S. Embassy at Caracas,

Een, caracas, stated they have no information concernin
the political scene in the herland illes that might involve

subject, and suggested tha A, Miami igh handles the Netherlands
