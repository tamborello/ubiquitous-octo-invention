1. Rowton met with LIRIXG/3 at the safehouse from. 4800 until about 1930
on 25 May,1967. LIRING/3 reported that as yet he had not heard from Garcia
and would stand by for the next two days in the hope that Garcia would re-
appeer at bis home. LIRING/3 agreed to invite Garcia, once he did. appear,
to coffee or lunch at a restaurant on 29 or 30 Hay so that Rowton could get
a look at him. LIRING/3 also reported that LIRING/4 hed been working part-
time, in the mornings, at the Consulate, and that her rapport with the local

‘ staff was improving. Rowton suggested that it might be the right time to give

LIRING/4 some compensation for her efforts. LIRING/3 agreed and promised .to
ask LIRING/4 to be at the safehouse at 1000 on 27 May, 80 that Rowton could
again talk privately with her and give her the money ( Rowton suggested 500
pesos, and LIRING/3 agreed that this would be adequate). : .

2. LIRING/3 reported that LIRING/4's resumption of contact had begun to pay
off better than he had thought possible. He explained that she had found an
opportunity on the afternoon of 23 May to chat with Abelardo Curbeho and had

_veturned home with some interesting information concerning the Cuban attitude —

toward LIRING/3 himself. According to LIRING/3, LIRING/4 said that Curbelo

stated that LIRING/4 nust understand that the "revolution 1s surrounded by

provocations” and that many persons on the outside, such as LIRING/3,have be-

come innocent victims of organizations such as WOFACTX, that are constantly
sending provocations against the revolution. Curbelo stressed that he did not
feel that LIRING/3 fell into that category, but LIRING/4 must understand the
precautions that have to be taken by the revolution. He concluded that he
hoped LIRING/3 would not take offense (tomarlo a mal) and would feel free to

3. LIRING/3 then stated that he was doing his best to keep active certain
contacts he had had in the past that were on the periphery of the official
Cuban circle. He mentioned speéifically the case of Silvia and Horacio Dur4n
that then explained the-background of his relationship with them. He related
that Silvia Dur&én worked as receptionist at the Consulate in 1963-64 and was
on duty when Lee Harvey Oswald applied for a visa. She had been recommended
to the Cubans by Teresa Proenza, the Press Attaché from 1959 until 1962. Li-

Cuba as the result of a conviction for espionage on behalf vl AOPACT. LI-
RING/3 recalled that during bis last visit to Havana, a friend of his in
the Ministry of Education, informed him of Teresa Proenza's present situation
| and advised LIRING/3, in the event he was asked, he deny that he had known
: Teresa Proenza or had had anything to do with her, LIRING/3 continued that
| just the other day Silvia Duran had telephoned him to say hello and that he
had visited her’at her home to renew his acquaintance. ( LIFEAT SAN~26(10.8)
reveals that at about 1245 on 22 May,19€7, LIRING/3 telephoned 15-78-11 and
asked for sra. Silvia. When (naid) informed him she not in, he asked for sr.
Horacio. When same negative reply given , he asked that they be advised that
LIRING/3 had called to say hello. SAN-26 (11.0) reveals an incoming call
' from Silvia Dur4n in which she asks how he obtained her number. He repiies:
"At the Cuban Institute". She states that she is studying at some school and
at the moment is free to talx to LIRING/3. The latter replies that he would
go by to visit her (Constituyentes 143, apt 3) in a few minutes.)

4, LIRING/3 continued that Silvia Durén informed him that she had first met
Oswald when he applied for a visa and had gone out with him several times since
she liked him from the start. She admitted that she had sexual relations with.
hin but insisted that she bad no idea of his plans. when the news of the as-
sassination broke she stated thet she was inmediately teken into custody by

} ~- the Mexican -police -and” ‘interrogated: thoroughly and beaten util she “admitted”
that she had had an affair with Cswald. She added that ever since then she has

cut off all contact with the Cubans, particularly since her husband Horacio,
who was badly shaken by the whole affairs, went into a rage and
has forbidden her to see them. She added that she felt certain thet her tele-

phone was tapped by the Mexican police, or, more probably by WOFACT, since

tapping was an expensive proposition and the Mexicans wouldn't be able to af-

ford it for so long a period. “y

5. Rowton ‘counseled LIRING/3 against any furth:r contact with the puréns on

the ground that it might put him under soma sort of suspicion either in the

eyes of the Mexican police or the Cubans. He pointed out that little or nothing

was to be gained from such a contact.

| Se LIRING/3 then produced, at Rowton's request, a sketch of the Consulate and

: Embassy premises, copy of which is attached. LIRING/3 commehted that to his
knowledge Cepeda did not have an office, at least not on the first fhoor. His
other comments appear on the sketch as reproduced,by Rowton.
