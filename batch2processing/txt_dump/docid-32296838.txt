The Informant stated that the name WILLIAM
ALEXANDER MORGAN is not familiar to him.

Informant said it is possible that he may
obtain some information regarding BARTONE from a source
other than BOBBIE JOHNS. He explained that about a month
ago, he was approached by a representative of the Cronin
Coal Company, Detroit, and asked whether or not he would
be interested in using his barges to transport slate from
Port Erie, Ontario, to Detroit. Informant said he showed
no interest in. the proposition, inasmuch as he does not
have enough barges to handle all of the rubbish he trans-
ports in connection with his disposal business.

Informant said if he learns of any connection
between BARTONE and any Detroit racket people, he would
advise the Detroit Office.

With reference to the investigation requested

'-by rerep, the telephone number TU 4-0245 is listed to

ROBERT E., MC CARTHY, JR., 1943 Huntington, Grosse Pointe,
Michigan, office telephone number WO 5-0511 (listed to
the Public Bank, Detroit).

According to information contained on pages 21-23
of the report of SA RAYMOND H, WILLIAMS, Detroit, dated
September 23, 1959, captioned, "SUN VALLEY, INC.; HENRY
ALBERT LOWER, aka.; JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; ITSP", Miami file
87-10768 , ROBERT E, MC CARTHY, JR., is the Assistant Vice
President of’ the Public Bank, Detroit, and was involved
in financial negotiations with JAMES HOFFA of the
Teamsters Union.

Agents who interviewed MC CARTHY in the above
case feel that he was evasive and would not be the type
of individual to contact in a discreet investigation. Since
MC CARTHY is Assistant Vice President of the Public Bank, a
relatively new bank in Detroit, it is not deemed advisable
to interview him or any other official regarding instant
matter.

In view of the nature of the information submitted
by DE 370-C, and the information developed concerning ROBERT

E, MC CARTHY, JR., no further action will be taken ¢by the
Detroit Office UAC, and no report will be submitted.:
