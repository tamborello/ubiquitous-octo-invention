NOTE: \

: This concerns the most recent of bombings which |
may be attributed to the anti-Castro Cuban power group
led by Orlando Bogeh _ in Miami. The "SS Coromoto"was three
miles at sea when thé explosion occurred and seawater would .
have flushed through the ballast tanks which were severely
damaged by the force of the explosion, It is highly im-
probable that Laboratory examination on the scene would be
productive,

We are instructing San Juan to cover dry-—docking
operations which are scheduled for 9/16/68 and Miami to in-~
tensify other phases of this bombing in order to either
associate it with others or to develop evidence which will
support criminal prosecution,

This was coordinated with the Laboratory Division.
