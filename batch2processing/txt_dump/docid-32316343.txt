_introduced to the men at -STEVEts table ‘but could not recall .
vtheir, names. - ‘The informant :then proceeded ‘to VINCENT SCROfs ©
and ‘CHARLES MONTANA's tables-and subsequently to-his-own. © :
Informant stated that there were no speeches and the purpose '
-of the stag was to raise money for the prospective son-in-law.., ;
CHARLES MONTANA advised the informant that 500 tickets had been
sold at $5 each and approximately 260 people were in attendance
at the party.. a mrs

At approximately 10:15 p.m. the informant decided to
leave and approached VINCENT SCRO's table in order to express
his regrets at having toleave his party. At this time VINCENT
SCRO determined from the informant that it was 10:15 pem. and
VINCENT glanced’ toward STEVE. STEVE stood up at which time all
thosein atteriaace ceased their activities and preparation began
for STEVE MAGADDINO's departure. According to the informant
two groups of men left the cafe one group going north and the
other south and each group examinéd the block prior to MAGADDINO'ts
departure. Shortly thereafter two mone groups ren left and
took positions .on both sides. of the door and’ 6n'the cur’ ing which
separated the street traffic from the door of the cafe. At
this point PAT NATARELLI and JAMES LA DUCA left the cafe walked
west and took positions near the parking lot. SAM RANGATORE,
the chauffeau for STEVE and another young Italian man had left
the cafe and walked toward the parking loc. RANGATORE ordered
the younger man to start the car and bring it to the edge of
the parking lot. It is the informant's opinion that this was
done in that if the automobile had a bomb in it the younger
Man was more expendable than RANGATORE or MAGADDINO. Subsequently
MAGADDINO came out of the door supported by FRED RANDACCIO who

' was holding his left arm and VINCENT SCRO who was on his right... i
According ito the informant it is“apparent that SCRO-and RANDACCIO
are in solid with the old man. Just before MAGADDINO entered his
Cadillac, he called:the informant’ over and told him good bye and
said he would see him this week. ‘

 

Informant will attempt to secure names of individuals
sitting at the head’ tables. : . '

As previously.reported, informant purchased three tickets
to this affair. .Informant made available one of the tickets which |
