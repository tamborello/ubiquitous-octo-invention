to them that SARATOV had come into the: Press ¢1ub alone on the
evening of '12 December,

8. PRIKHODKO. Subjects had PRIKHODKO to dinner with a small
crowd of other guests on the evening of Monday,\11 December;
PRIKHODKO didn't arrive until 2130 or 2200 and explained that he
had had to attend a "reception" (no mention of where) beforehand.
Although LIROBBIN~-2 specifically asked him to bring his wife, he
as usual,showed up without her. When LIROBBIN=2 asked where his
wife was, he smiled blandly and said, ‘She's at home. She likes it
there.” The only guest PRIKHODKO showed any particular interest in
was a Brit by the name of. Denny JACOBSON. JACOBSON, according to

‘LIROBBIN-2,came to Mexico about 6-8 months ago and works for IBM here.

LIROBBIN=-2 said that JACOBSON is a friend of Jose (Pepe) “ncuLo,
and like ANGULO, is a homosexual. Subjects said that PRIKHODKO
spent a good hour and a half or more talking with JACOBSON off
to one side, After PRIKHODKO left (about 0130), JACOBSON told
LIROBBIN-1 that, PRIKHODKO had asked him to demonstrate some IBM
machines for him. JACOBSON implied to LIROBBIN-1 that he had

: agreed to demonstrate the machines. (The 1967-68 Anglo-American

9. Subjects also saw PRIKHODKO on two other occasions since

I last talked with them:
(a) At “Pearl GONZALEZ" s shome on Thanksgiving evening

 

  
. . ae ” nd

 

(23 November) » As she did last year,’ Pearl had a big’ Thanksgiving
‘dinner to which she invited PRIKHODKO, the LIROBBINS, and a number
a of people from the ‘Bress Club. Subjects said the evening was
uneventful.
(b) At Benno LIEBERMANN's Folkloric Association on the
evening of: 9 ) December, This was Russian (or Ukrainian) night at
. the Association and PRIKHODKO was there with various members of
the Ukrainian Ice Ballet troupe. Subjects recalled that about a year
ago LIEBERMANN had tried to get Soviet Embassy cooperation for
; a Russian night, but had always been put, off (see CR report of
9 Jan 1967), Subjects said they didn't”know how LIEBERMANN and
the ‘Soviets had finally managed to get together.

10. Although not previously reported, LIROBBIN-1 told me in
November that he and LIROBBIN-2 had attended the celebration of —

 

the October Revolution at the Soviet Embassy on'7 November. . d
‘LIROBBIN-1 had told me that nothing of any special interest had :
occurred and _LIROBBIN=2 onfirmed this on 14 December.
ll. I told Subjects to take advantage of any opportunities

wwe to become friendly with SYCHEV and especially SARATOV, since it

looks as though they may be seeing these two Soviets at the Press|

Glub ifrom time to time. I specifically suggested that they invite
SYCHEV and SARATOV the next time they invite PRIKHODKO to a party. oT

I told them that while they obviously could not drop PRIKHODKO,

we were nonetheless mre interested in SYCHEV and SARATOV and
would like to have them at least be on good terms with either

or both of these Soviets when the time came for PRIKHODKO to leave
Mexico (which Mrs. PRIKHODKO has said they will do sometime in

_ 1968). | a ¢ sB/L

KAPLAN case after RAMSEY's sudden and involuntary departure from
Mexico. In these articles Pearl repeatedly cited the possibility
that the CIA might well be inyolved in the KAPLAN case because of
KAPLAN's uncle's connection “the Agency ‘(ises, the KAPLAN Fund)
(There was considerable correspondence with Headquarters on RAMSEY's
visit. LIROBBIN-1's previous reporting on RAMSEY, who according
to Pearl has since been fired by RAMPARTS# is contained ina
Memorandum for the Record dated 3 May 1967.)

(bo) That RAMPARTS arranged Pearl's interview with GARRISON
ané paid for her trip to New Orleans. The reason for this is
that RAMPARTS is trying to put together evidence that the KAPLAN

ease is directly connected with the assassination of President

- Kennedy. Although Pearl was not at all clear about this, one

element in RAMPARTS theory is evidently that KAPLAN was the person
who tipped off Castro on the timing of the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Because of this, RAMPARTS' theory runs, Senator Robert Kennedy has

been exerting (presumably a@kex either directly or through the

U.S. Government--and ultimately the U.S. Embassy in Mexico) pressure

on the Mexican Government to keep KAPLAN imprisoned.

(c) That RAMPARTS has about six staff reporters working on
the story and that one of these reporters sat in on Pearl's
interview of GARRISON{

(d) That GARRISON was so impressed by Pearl that he ‘asked
her to join his staff (which she declined to do).

(e) That Pearl went on to New York from New Orleans and
talked to a famous trial lawyer there about the KAPLAN case.
3. The LIROBBINS! opinion of Pearl is somewhat ambivalent.

On the one hand, they consider her a friend and enjoy her company.

On the other, however, they recognize that she is a very impression=

able, left-leaning, and irresponsible person and are concerned
about the harm she is doing to her own government. While I am
certain they would not want to be responsible for the U.S. Government |
taking any action against Pearl--such as trying to have her thrown
out of Mexico-=-they nevertheless both suggested that the U.S. .
Embassy at least protest to Publicaciones Herrerias about her
provocative stories appearing on the front page of The NEWS.
LIROBBIN-1 added that he understood that. either Romulo O'Farrill
Sr. or Jr. had considered Pearl's GARRISON article to be too
muckrakish to print in NOVEDADES/ Yet he permitted it to *
on the front page of The NEWS.

4s SARATOV and SYCHEV. Subjects said they had seen SARATOV
and SYCHEV together at the Press Club ‘twice in the past two weeks.
SYCHEV was introducing SARATOV around on both occasions and
introduced him to Subjects on the first. Subjects chatted with
SARATOV both times and found him very friendly and outgoing, but
much less aggressive than SYCHEV. Subjects explained that SYCHEV
is "outgoing" to the point that he will zero in on someone he has
just been introduced to and ask the person so many questions as
to literally debrief him on his whole life. SARATOV's English
grammar and American accent, according to Subjects, are a little
better than SYCHEV's, although SYCHEV uses more American slang
and colloquialisms than SARATOV. SARATOV asked Subjects to call
him "Ed." ;

5. Subjects said they were very impressed by SARATOV's ‘seemingly

genuine liking for the United States. While he said nothing about
having attended Yale, he spoke enthusiastically of his tour in

Washington, of how much he and his wife had Liked it there, and of
how they had hated to leave. In fact, his wife, he said, had come

_to like the U.S. so much and become so used to the modern conveniences

of life in the United States, that she was having a hard time
adjusting to Mexico. SARATOV went on to say that he had traveled
all over the United States. When one of Subjects asked him if

he had been in Chicago, he replied that he had and he thought it
was a great city. Had he been in san Francisco, someone asked.
Oh, Sqn Francisco, he answered=-he loved San Francisco and wold
love to live there. New Orleans? Yes, he had had the best time:
of his life in New Orleans and thought it was a great place.
Shortly thereafter, someone asked a question about Moscow (if it
had changed much in the last ten years or some thing similar).

In sharp contrast to his enthusiatic comments onthe United States,
SARATOV brushed off the question by replying uninterestedly that
he hadn't been back to Moscow for two and a half years and in
the last ten years really hadn't seen much of Moscow at all.
Subjects noted that SARATOV made only one other reference to the
USSR in the two times they talked with him (see next paragraph)
and that he avoided political topics completely.

6. SARAPOV mentioned that he had specialized in languages in ;
school andhad worked as a guide in the USSR "for Americans and
Latin Americans," because "those two languages" were his "specialty."
(Since Subjects spoke G&SSHRATG¥ with SARATOV in English, they
have not heard him speak Spanish.)
