: The Informant was displayed a photograph of

ALFRED LICARI and immediately identified him as (FNU)

CICCIALINNI, the "sleeper hit man" hehad mentioned on 3/7/69.

However, after gazing at the photograph he became less positive

(the photograph is dated 1943), but he still believes it to be
CICCIALINNI. . 1

The Informant identified a photograph of JOHN ANGELONE
as being identical to JOHNNY ANG, LCN member of the GAMBINO i
family and a hi- ~jacker previously mentioned by the Informant. aa
He stated JOHNNY's "capo" is "Papa DAVE," who hangs out at a
club on Morris Park Avenue, one block north of White Plains
Road, on the corner above a lunchenette.

.

 

The Informant was reminded of one, CARLO (LNU) aka
Sally, who hangs out at the Bay 50 Club. CARLO is a member
‘of the COLOMBO family and is a bookmaker and shylock. He used
to hang out in the Seventeen-Seventeen Club, located on 17th Ave
and 86th St in Brooklyn. The Informant said he met CARLO in
1956 and CARLO was already a member then.

The Informant was shown a photograph of RALPH POLLIZIO
and identified him as a member of the GAMBINO family whom he
knew as RALPHIE. The Informant first met POLLIZIO in Sing Sing in
1938-39. He was not a member of the LCN at this time, but was
made after WW II. POLLIZIO is with GENE HARLOW (ph), another
GAMBINO member, who is either a lieutenant or a "capo" according
to the Informant. Both hang out in a small bar at 4th Ave and Union
in Brooklyn. . .

The Informant observed a photograph of WILLIAM
PILKINGTON and remarked that this person closely resembled a man
known to the Informant as STUMPY. STUMPY is a "hit man" for
the Morris Park mob, headed by JOE HOOKS. He is a LCN member,
but the Informant was not sure in which family. STUMPY killed
DANNY the Dip on 152nd St and Morris Ave with a pistol in 1946-47,
DANNY had been attempting to cut in on JOHNNY FUTO's "action" !
and rumor had spread that a "hit" had been issued against him
by FUTO. However, to dispel this rumor, a large ‘banquet was
thrown ostensibly to establish beyond all. doubt that DANNY was
acceptable among the "boys" and need not travel around in fear.
After the dinner, STUMPY walked out with DANNY and when they were
in the middle of the street, STUMPY shot and killed him and left
his body there in the street.

The Informant advised that MIKE MIRANDA. a
"consiglieri" in the GENOVESE family, controls the brick-
layers helpers union in Long Island from the union offices
in Long Island City. He is assisted in controlling this
union by FILIPPO LOMBARDO aka Benny Squint, and a family of
Italians with a last name similar to CHARIZOLDA (ph). This
family is referred to as the ."CHERRY FAMILY."

 

SF 3208-C-Te advised that one of the brothers, GIGI
CHERRY, was killed about six years ago in Long Beach, Long :
Island, New York, for getting out of line. GIGI was known as y
"The Squint." His father-in-law, DANNY HOGAN % true name believed ,
‘to be DANNY SCALATO (ph) }} was present when GIGI was killed
and was believed. to have set the murder victim up for the killing. |
SCALATO is an LCN member in BENNY SQUINT's regime,

: The Informant advised that BENNY SQUINT and BORBY
CHERRY operated the union for several years. Prior to his
knowledge of this, the Informant had made moves to cut in on
the union himself. He-had a meeting scheduled with the unknown
union bosses at union headquarters, When the Informant arrived
at the meeting, he found himself facing MIKE MIRANDA. When
MIRANDA saw. the Informant he reportedly laughed and asked
if this was "the guy" who was cutting in. The Informant said .
he laughed too and told MIRANDA that he had no idea that
MIRANDA was behind the union. The Informant said that no
problem arose over this confrontation, largely because of
his long-time association with MIRANDA. and the Informant
backed off from the union deal, To the best of his knowledge,
the Informant said MIRANDA still heads this union.

. Other photos from the surveillance in New York
which the Informant recognized included one of RUMMY DALE,
taken after he had an Operation on his eyes, according to
the Informant. DALE used to wear glasses prior to the
operation. The Informant said the location of this photograph
appeared to be outside a club on Morris Avenue between 150th
Street and 15ist Street, Another of these photographs appeared
similar to BLACKIE BOVIE (ph), who the Informant said was in
jukeboxes and shylocking. BLACKIE is not known to the Informant ‘
as a LCN member, He used to live at 117th Street and 2nd Ave., i
‘but moved to 116th St. between lst and 2nd Avenues, Manhattan. a
BLACKIE was known to the Informant as a"recruit"in the COLOMBO
family. The Informant said BLACKIE's brother, MIKE BOVIE (ph),
is a member of the COLOMBO family, having been made in 1957,
He is a bartender by trade. The Informant said he personally
disliked both BOVIE brothers and did not know any details
about their operations or activities,

; The Informant was visibly agitated with himself :
over not being able to recognize a photograph of FLORINDA ISABELLA,
which he said «was very familiar. The name of ISABELLA did not
prompt his memory, but he said he probably knew him by a nickname.
This photograph will be redisplayed at a future meeting to

prompt his memory. .

The Informant was shown a photo which appeared blurry
and indistinct and he said it appeared to be of either ANGELO
HOOKS, aka "Cockeyed Ang" or JOE HOOKS, his brother. ANGELO is
a shylock, bookmaker, and LCN member under BENNY DE MARTINO... He
hangs out at a bar on 15lst or 152nd Streets and Morris Ave., on
the Southwest corner, which is owned by JOE HOOKS, FAT FERRARA,
CHINK (LNU) and SAL DIANO, all LCN members previously mentioned
by the Informant.

The Informant advised that the following photographs
were not familiar to him:

York Office sent in this meeting, inasmuch as it has been
noticed in the past that the Informant gets restless and tired

The group of photographs taken during a photographic
surveillance in New York were initially shown to the Informant,
The four poses of CHARLES GIAMPAOLO, aka Charlie the Baker, failed
to elicit any response of recognition from the Informant. He

Brook Ave., where he operates a couple of bars. The Informant

said he last knew BRUNO to be a "recruit" for membership in the

LCN and has not heard whether he was ever made or not. In addition :
\ to numbers, BRUNO also Operates some jukeboxes. He is known to

many as "PHILLY from the Bronx," and is -from Morris Avenue. The
Informant said the background in the photo appeared to be 150th: ~
Street and Morris Ave., next to the barbershop. .

 

The Informant said BRUNO was partners with JOEY FUSCO (ph) 1
in the numbers operation. FUSCO was not known as a member to the
Informant and was last known by him to be running a grocery store
on either 150th or 151st Streets, between Morris Avenue and Park
Avenue, Bronx, New York, The Informant said BRUNO was also aligned
with his cousin, NICKY BRUNO, aka Baldy, until five years ago, when
NICKY was gunned down in his car and killed. Now NICKy*ts brother

The Informant said the same year he was admitted to
the LUCHESE family, about 1958, a split-up occurred in part
of GENOVESE's family, with three men getting a "piece of the
action." TADO DEL took over a "regime" in Brooklyn, N.Y¥., PETE 4
DOLCE got a group, and MIKE MIRANDA retained the "cream of the
crop." Not long after this, MIRANDA became a "consiglieri"
in the GENOVESE family. MIKE maintains his office on the
Southwest corner of Kenmare and Lafayette in New York City.
Diagonally across the intersection on the Northeast corner is
| the New York City PD Headquarters for burglary. MIKE used this
spot for meetings frequently.

 

SF 3208-C-TE identified another "sleeper" member of
the LCN*is DOMINIC (LNU), aka "Fat Dom." DOMINIC is about 48-50
years of age, 5'8", 220 lbs., heavy build. He owns and operates
a string of private cabs in New York City. The Informant said
DOMINIC is a sloppy dresser and dirty. DOMINIC's brother, SALLY
(true name believed to be SALVATORE), is also a LCN member. SALLY
is about 56 years of age, 5'8", 175-180, brown hair combed straight
back. He is operating as a bookmaker. The Informant advised that
11/2 years ago, DOMINIC ran his business out of an office on
Westchester Ave by Castlehill Ave in New York City. However, he
has subsequently moved locations and the Informant does not know
where he is presently located. SALLY used to use DOMINIC's office
at the cab company as his bookmaking headquarters. :

 

The Informant advised he is unaware of an arrest record
for either of the brothers, He could not recall which families
they belonged to, but he said they were originally pointed out to
-him as LCN members by TADO DE MARCO. He added that their membership
was not generally known. .

The Informant identified still another "sleeper" member
of the LCN as the undertaker who owned themortuary located on 109th
Street between lst and 2nd Avenues on the north side of the street.
This person owns another mortuary in the Bronx. The Informant
recalled this person belonging to the GAMBINO family, but he could.
: not remember his name. His main purpose was to bail other members
out of jail and he was not used for illegal purposes. The Informant
said JOHNNY ANG pointed this person out to him and identified him
as a member.

In regard to the Roman Catholic priests who were
allegedly members of the LCN in New York, the Informant said
"BENNY the Bum" DE MARTINO made a statement that there were
"quite a few priests that are with us." The Informant said
he questioned BENNY as to whether he actually meant they were
members, and BENNY replied in the affirmative. He said the
priests have been used Mainly for such as smuggling, although
he stated they have been used on "hits" before, not specifying
in what capacity they were used on these "hits." At no time
did BENNY divulge the identities of these priests and the
Informant said it would have been improper for him to ask.
The Informant mentioned that ALBERT ANASTASIA's brother isa
Catholic Priest, but he said he did not know any derogatory
information about him.

 

The Informant mentioned JIMMY NAP (phonetic) as a:
LCN member who runs a cabaret in Jersey City, N.J., two blocks
from 7th and Central. NAP assertedly hid SONNY FRANCHEESI (ph)
from the authorities for a while after FRANCHEESI pulled a bank
robbery. FRANCHEESI was hidden out in Brooklyn in the apartment
used at the time by JIMMY as a residence, FRANCHEESI, who the
Informant also identified as a LCN member, was finally arrested ‘
by the FBI on bank robbery charges.

SF 3208-C TE stated that one (FNU) Q@LANDRIA (ph), a
New York State Assemblyman from the Bronx, is a close friend of
BENNY DE MARTINEO., . CALANDRIA is related to AL MINIACCI, the
owner of the Paramount Vending Company, and BENNY DE MARTINO
has told the informant in the past that CALANDRIA is "in my
pocket." The Informant said BENNY reserves the right to deal .
with CALANDRIA personally and is guarded over this relationship
and what actually transpires between them. The Informant said
BENNY has made sizeable contributions to CALANDRIA's political
funds. |

The Informant recalled a large gambling establishment a
which was operated outside ef Palisades, New Jersey; between
1945-1947, This was LCN run and one PETEY MUGGINS (ph) was
usually at the door to the place searching those who entered,
PETEY was a member of what is now the GENOVESE family at the time.
The Informant said he was personally in this establishment on a
number of occasions and had Mayor HAGUE of Jersey City pointed
out to him as a patron: .

it would be very unusual for Kansas City people to be involved
as the radio indicated they were. He acknowledged that the
Chicago family pulls a lot of weight, but he did not believe
this to be true of the Kansas City family. The Informant said
a logical place for a new "boss" to be chosen was the Napoli

’ di Notte," an Italian restaurant located off of Spring and
Thompson in Manhattan. He described this place as very small
and said it was used frequently for high level LCN meetings and
to make new members. It is allegedly owned by the father of
THOMAS EBOLI, aka Tommy Ryan, “acting boss" of the Genovese
family. :

The informant advised that TONY PLATE (phonetic) is .

a member of the LCN,. but he did not know which family. He described
PLATE as white, male, Italian, 53 years of age, 5' 9", 180 lbs.,

‘black hair, wears glasses. He said PLATE runs a bar on McLean

Avenue in Yonkers, N.Y., toward.the Broadway end of the street.

He is involved in shylocking, bookmaking, and has an interest in

a milk company in New York City. According to the Informant, PLATE
tried to get into the LCN under "BENNY the Bum" DE MARTINO, but

did not make it. He was eventually made under another “regime"
‘possibly in a separate "family."

SF 3208-C-TE advised that there is an emphasis in the LCN
in New York toward penetrating legitimate businesses. He said
many legitimate businessmen want to have LCN support because
of some apparent advantages, including obtaining a better .
market because of the pressures brought to bear by the LCN
partners on the compétitors and customers. For instance, accord-
ing to the Informant, a legitimate vending machine businessman
may see that by entering into a partnership with an LCN figure
he could expand his routes and customers by two or three times,
simply because of the intimidation which the LCN figure could ©
bring upon the customers, Other businessmen lose control of
their businesses because of shylock indebtedness. The Informant
identified the liquor store on 78th Street, between lst and 2nd
Avenues, New York City, as an example of an LCN-owned enterprise.

The Informant advised that many of the LCN members
made after WW II never did get fully embroiled in the rackets
and many are now legitimate working people. He added that they
are still subject to the discipline of their family"boss" and
their "capo decina." If their services are needed, they must

respond or be killed themselves. The Informant said: these
men are frequently used to get into positions of influence
in businesses and unions and then use this influence for the LCN.

 

The Informant cited an example of this by naming (FNU)
CICCIALINNI (phonetic), a foreman of the Sicilian Asphalt Company,
New York City. He is also an official in the labor union covering .
that activity. According to the Informant, CICCIALINNI is a ‘
"sleeper" member of the GENOVESE family, and may be a lieutenant oe
or a "capo." The Informant met CICCIALINNI ten years ago, being
introduced to him by TADO DE MARCO in CICCIALINNI's house in
Brooklyn. The Informant described CICCIALINNI as "ice cold,"
extremely quiet, and a "mean S.0.B," He said CICCIALINNI is a
“hit man" used only for very important killings and he said
CICCIALINNI is very thorough in his assignments. The Informant
waS unaware of CICCIALINNI ever being arrested before. He said
CICCIALINNI is not known to many LCN members as a member himself.
He described CICCIALINNI as white, male, Italian, in his 60s,
stocky build, 5' 7" , appearing many years younger than he is,
greying hair dyed black.

 

: The Informant said TADO DE MARCO coulda be referred to
as a "sleeper" also. He is influential in the GBNOVESE family
-and is frequently used to handle big assignments. The Informant

added that DE MARCO very seldom goes along on an assignment,
especially a “hit," but generally handles the delegation of the
assignment and the follow-up. DE MARCO owns a trucking firm in
Tunisia and has a brother running it for him there. He also
has extensive property in Sicily and owns some homes and apartment
houses in the Bronx, New York area. However, DE MARCO himself
lives very modestly and is reluctant to show his possession

of wealth, He even requires his wife to work for one of the
biscuit companies in Long Island City by the 59th Street Bridge,
DE MARCO assertedly sold a 32-unit apartment house recently in
the Bronx,

The Informant said DE MARCO holds meetings in a liquor
store on 2nd Ave., between 105th and 106th Streets, on the west
side of the street about two doors off of 106th Street. He last
lived on 3rd Ave. between 116th and 117th Streets, on the east
side of the street next to a real estate company, two stories
above a TV Store,
