VEGA has been conducted with negative results as
reflected in re Newark and New York letters. All
available New York Directories have been checked and
numerous telephonic pretext inquiries to listed FRANK
VEGAS have failed to locate a FRANK VEGA fitting the
description of the subject. :

The following sources of the NYO, who are
fahbliar with pro-CASTRO activities in the New York
area, have been contacted and can furnish no information

concerning a FRANK VEGA: .

The NYO has been unable to effectam identification
of captioned subject on the basis of information furnished
by HARRY DEAN. In this connection it should be noted.
the name VEGA is a common Spanish-Italian type name in
the New York City Metropolitan area. In the absence of more
specific identifying data the NYO feéls no useful
purpose will be served by continuation of this investigation
at this time. Accordingly, UACB, no further investigation
is being conducted, and an LHM classified "Confidential"
is being enclosed herewith for the Bureau (9 copies), Los
