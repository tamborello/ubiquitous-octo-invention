Why did Deborah MILLINGTON telephone New Orleans in March 1989? A
controversial documentary concerning the assassination of President
KENNEDY had been broadcast on British television in March 1989 which
caused her to remember the events of many years ago. She became so
incensed by the subsequent debate conducted in the media that she
decided to telephone New Orleans to see if Joseph GIARRUSO was still
Chief of Police. When in New Orleans she had felt sorry for him over
the criticism he received after Clay SHAW's acquittal. She seeks no
publicity or further involvement. In fact she was somewhat aghast

at me contacting her as her intention was to remain anonymous.

Enquiries of Sussex Police show that she lives in a good class area’
of Brighton and nothing to her detriment could be found in local
records. At this stage there is nothing to indicate that the events
didn't happen. It was, however, impossible to assess the true extent
of her knowledge. Should it be considered necessary I will attempt
to take the matter further.

I ask that this report be forwarded to the Legal Attache, US Embassy,
London for his information.

 

This report is forwarded on the condition that neither it not irs
contents will be forwarded to any other individual or organisation
without the prior approval of the Commissioner of Police of the
Metropolis, New Scotland Yard, London, SW1.

Assassination of a

A report was received under reference 175A-DL-109 from the Office
of Legal Attache, US Embassy, London wherein it was requested that
Reference to Papers further enquiries be made in the UK to assist a current investi-
gation by the FBI in Dallas. An anonymous telephone call had

been received in New Orleans relating to the marginally quoted
subject and previous UK enquiries had tentatively identified the
caller.

 

 
 

Initial enquiry showed ah MILYINGTON to be away from her
Brighton address on business. She jeventually contacted me on

31 August 1989 and readily admitted telephoning Joseph GIARRUSO in
March 1989. During the conversation I was able to elicit the
following.

She was previously married to an American and between 1966 and 1969
she lived in the New Orleans area working as an assistant physio-
therapist at the Touro Infirmary. Through general conversation she
discovered that one of the patients was the wife of a New Orleans
attorney and that the law firm, for whatever reason, had a
secretarial problem. As she was able to type she offered her
services at weekends when necessary. Having had no training as a
legal secretary, much of what she typed meant nothing to her.

One letter did however, which was to the mother of Lee Harvey OSWALD.
After all this time she can only say that it related to money

being sent to her.(the mother) and it seemed to refer in some way
to President KENNEDY's assassination. She initially considered
informing the authorities but decided against it as she didn't

wish to bring herself to attention. She denied ever being
interviewed by the New Orleans Police Department during the Clay
SHAW trial. She was aware of the nature of this trial and was
aware of the name Clay SHAW within the attorneys office but she
cannot now remember in what context.
