ing of WALTER GLOCKNER, and that his associates haa no idea

ake over the operation and management of Lccal 560 in the
event that PRCVENZANO went to jail.

NK 2159-C speculated that WALTER GLOCKNER was not

be made with him regarding his alleged comment that he would
testify for the government ageinst TONY PROVENZANO in the

i scheduled to contact GLOCXNER made some remark and GLOCKNER
' refused to go with them, In a "hot-headed. exchange", GLOCKNER
was shot.

It is not clear fron rerep whether the man who reportedly

Licenses number ef the automobile which sped from the scene ef the
shooting is Frank Kimmerle or whether there may be another witness

On the basis of information set out in rerepand in the
report of SA Russel F. Sullivan dated 6/7/63 at New York, it is
suggested that the following lines of investigation, in\addition to
the other investigation which is\now under way, be pursued to a
proper conclusion, . ~ ‘

\ ‘ ‘
New York PCE Co advised that Ton Kenny, "Bull" Kenrorner 4
and "Borky” Daley, friends © mos J, Reynolds, are strong-arm sen

and carry guns. It appears that the enly investigation which

has been conducted is aa interview with Thomas Henny ‘set out on

page 216 of rerep. According to this individual, “Worky” Baley

died several years ago. No information was developed nor was

any investigation conducted concerning “Bull” Benny. it is suggested

that inguiries be made in an effort to verify the aeath of “Porky”

Daley; that "Bull" Kenny be identified, located and interviewed; me

that statements be obteined from him and Thomas Kenny as te their where-
abouts during the pertinent peried and that investigation be conducted

to verify or refute the alibis that they furnish. Efforts should be

made to determine further whether these individuals have been known to
carry guns. If so, the guns should be located and considered as ;

possible suspect weapons in connection with the shooting of
Glockner. ,

Similar investigation should be conducted with respect to
Richie Barrett and Tommy Clark, former employees of the Quinn Freight
Lines who, according to Joseph Mitchell Smith, are closely associated
with Reynolds. Smith also said that Barrett usually carries a
pistol. Efforts also should be made to verify Smith's statement
that Nunzio Provenzano reportedly was seen giving money to Barrett
and Clark. If this can be substantiated the reason for Nunzio
Provenzano paying these individuals should be determined.

With respect to the gun involved in the murder of Glockner,
it is noted that the laboratory report of the New Jersey State
Bolice, set out on pages 306 and 307 of rerep, did not state the
make of weapon used in the murder or the probable make of this
weapon. For the information of Newark and New York, the FBI Labora-
tory has advised that from descriptive data set out in the mentioned
laboratory report it appears that the bullets would have been fired
from a Colt revolver chambered for .38 caliber Smith and Wesson
cartridges. This opinion is based 6n the fact that the rifling
characteristics are six lands and’ grooves with a lefthand twist.

The possibility also should net be overlooked that some Spanish made
revolvers may have similar rifling: characteristics. oO

Newark and New York should consider the feasibility of
examining pistol permits issued by local authorities in an effort
to determine whether any permits were issued to officials or members
of Local 560 or their associates for a .38 caliber Colt revolver.

Ef so, consideration should be given-to endeavoring to lecate the
weapons in order that test specimens may be fired from them.

Investigation should be made to determine whether Angelo
Sporaco, reported by NK2282-C as a strong-arm man for the union and
as having visited the office of Teamsters Local 810 in New York City
twice during the week prior to 5/24/63 accompanied by Nunzio
Provenzano and Sal Briguglio, was involved in the murder of Glockner.
Sporaco's whereabouts during the pertinent period should be ascer-
tained and necessary investigation conducted to verify or refute his
alibi.
