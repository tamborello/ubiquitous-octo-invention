SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
RE: DEPOSITION OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR W. RAYMOND WANNALL

In response to questioning, Mr. Wannall stated
that he could not recall any instances wherein names
regarding the Cuban Watch List were submitted orally to
NSA, but it was possible’ that this may have been done in
some cases, He was not able to comment on the volume of
material received from NSA in connection with the Cuban
Watch List since the product went directly te the desks
of the supervisors handling Cuban matters within his
Section. He did recall that the quality of information
was in some instances very good@&{since it related to
known or suspected| Cuban Intelligence Agents operating
in thé United States and Puerto Rico. )V7S)

The memorandum of May 18, 1962, referred to
the fact that it would be helpful to the FBI to receive
a periodic listing of firms in the U.S, which were doing
business with individuals in Cuba and with the Cuban
Government, In explaining this comment, it was pointed
out that the U.S, Government had established a list of
restricted items which could not be sent to Cuba without
an export license and material of this nature would have
been of value to the FBI to establish identities of firms
which might be contravening the provisions of regulations
so adopted and administered by the Department of Commerce.
It was pointed out that to Mr. Wannall's knowledge no

such U.S, firms were subsequently included on the Watch
List.

The memorandum of January 16, 1963, referred
to the possibility of furnishing to NSA a listing of
approximately 1,100 Cuban invasion prisoners and 900

relatives of these prisoners who had recently been

admitted to the U.S, It was explained that this referred
to the prisoners taken by the Cubans during the Bay of

Pigs invasion in April, 1961, who, to the best of Mr. Wannali's

recollection, had been released by the Cuban Government and

had returned to the United States around Christmastime of
1962,

‘It waS pointed out that to the best of Mr. Wannall's
recollection, representatives of NSA conducted a general
briefing of certain personnel of the Domestic Intelligence
Division sometime around the Fall of 1969 in order that the
