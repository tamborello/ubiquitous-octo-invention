delivered to the Dallas Office in November 1963 and later
destroyed by SA James Hosty. The Dallas Office should check all
indices for any documents related to the “Note” to include the
investigation about the “Note”.

Dallas should conduct a search of its office for the
listed items. If Dallas is aware of any administrative records
they may have maintained outside the normal index systems, they
should also search those areas. If any documents related to the
matters are found, please forward the documents to the JFK Task
Force.

assassination record must be sent to the NARA in its original
form. The Act establishes the process of handling the documents
and the FBI must follow the Act. If Dallas believes their office
needs, a copy, they should copy the document or material before
sending to the JFK Task Force.

If you have any questions, please call Joe Iazetta at
(202) 324-8688.
