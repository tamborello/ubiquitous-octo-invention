The only country in all of history with a Constitution that protects

freedom of religion and one's personal rights of beltef and speech --,pro-
tecting-.them as the church separate from the State. In return, not one of
500,000 priests, rabbis and preachers is protecting the Constitution -~ the

right of free beliefs and free speech. (Add 75 as the possible exception).
Dr. Criswell with 40 pulpiteers, Dr. Elliott with 60 and Dr. Wm. R.

Bright, were given top secret briefings in the White House. Dr. Crisweil

made the release that his group was briefed by Billy Graham and Kissinger.

Do you go to a church and tithe a pulpit that has not been> briefed

in the White House? Why?

Briefings work both ways -- State to Church and Church to State. Be-
side being told State secrets, the pulpiteers tell the State what they can

do for the State, what the State should do and of their support for the

Chief of State, present and future. -

Police States have always briefed their State Pulpiteers. If they
did not go along they were, and are, defrocked.

Criswell, after the briefing, told Graham and Kissinger, for his
pulpit, and the public, in a press release, that he had changed his views
on State issues -- describing the issues and the changes ~- to so commit
and use his pulpit.

* *

“Graham who came, and went, from the White House, spending a week there
when LBJ waS campaigning, now has a permanent Washington suite in the White
House with Nixon. He has much in common with Khrushchev who said, "There
are not two parties in America." ~

CAESAR Caesars Ecumenicalization, then made the Ecumenicalized grab.
of the Holy Land with his 500,000 pulpiteers, armed with the Lord's return
and all the money that the pushers and suckers can part with. He is the
same CAESAR that has destroyed every nation. Pushers, suckers and Sunday
kneelers have the same conviction, that of their-pulpits, that all is Satan
and they are in the right place and pew. All is not Satan but CAESAR. a

Catholic Senator M. Mansfield, for 16 years, has controlled every’
national: official majority--church and State--the US Senate coalition of
catholics, jews, protestants, athiests and isms. The gaps and incredibility,
as they are touted to be -- four presidents -- dead, assassinated, ditched .
and rattling on, are not what théy are touted to be. There is a plan and
consistency, the Mansfieldized ECU Senate -- “Crusade in Europe", "Crusade
in Asia", and "Crusade in the Mid-East". With the ECU-ed Holy Land grab,

- a total military victory in six days, June 1967, came the complete change

of feathers exposing the bloody jungle ‘war as’ the detoured-diversion from
the four foreign ECU tithed cities -- Rome, Tel- Aviv, Geneva and Moscow.

Marcus, Loeb and Rothchild, with their membership in tens | of thou-
sands, say, "Israel is not'a jewish State--not a State of jews. Zionists,
with their membership in hundreds of thousands, say, "Israel is a Jewish
State--a State of Jews." No one has said that Israel is of CAESAR -~- the
land of ECU and its capitol Jerusalem--the land of the Balfor Treaty, the
UNO, Truman, Nixon, McGovern and Humphrey--the 5ist state protected by

their commitment of all youth and all weapons, of all the other 50 states.

Mansfield with his majority, to include McGovern (with the support

of VP Humphrey and the Whip to be, Kennedy) signed the Senate's Tonkin

Declaration directing the President's action..: They’ signed what you read
in Section 3, directing: "This resolution’ shall expire when the President
shall determine that the peace and security of the area is reasonably as-
sured by international ‘conditions created by action of the United Nations.

Correctly para- plirased a dozen ways it gives the proper answer to all
questions about the bloody jungle war in Asia--its beginning without public
and military support and its’ ending in military retreat and defeat.

What and who, but the pulpits, their banks and "Crusades" could fight

a ten-year bloody, jungle war, Tonkin“Undeclared? against no declared enemy,
. on top of, and among sub- standard people with no arms, abiding and abetting

pot, crime, arson, immorality; "pigs", hi-jackings, peace corps, Superstar,
no school prayer, God is dead, Foumanicalized xevolution and its propitious

grab of the. Holy” Land -- who’ but CAESAR?

EDWIN A. WALKER
. C 401t TURTLE CREEK BLVD. C)
a DALLAS, TEXAS 75219

May 31, 1972

Catholic Senator M. Mansfield
U. S. Senate
Washington, D. C.

Dear Senator Mansfield:

As a catholic and head of all official majorities -- church,
party and State for 16 years you are aware of the secret briefings
of priests, rabbis and preachers, by Billy Graham and Mr. Kissinger
in the White House. The briefings cover the secret policies of the
U. S. Senate.

Briefings work both ways ~~ State to church and church to State.
Dr. Criswell, from his pulpit, told Graham, Kissinger and the public,
after the briefing, that he had changed his position and beliefs on
State issues.

The constitution provides for freedom of religion, free beliefs
and speech, separate from the State.

You and your majorities with McGovern (supported by Vice-President
Humphrey and your coming Whip, Eddie K.) signed the Senate's Tonkin
Sea'd Declaration of War, directing the President' action. All sign-
ers are well aware of the statement in the document which says, "This
resolution shall expire when the President shall determine that the
peace and security of the area is reasonably assured by international
conditions created by action of the United Nations."

This statement can be correctly paraphrased in a dozen different

ways to properly answer all questions about the bloody jungle war

in Asia -- its beginning without public and military support and its
ending in military retreat and defeat.

If it means what it says and what 80 signatures confirm, all
the diatribes and propaganda by senators and their booby tube
generals, are hog-wash regarding Vietnam and Israel.

Your explanation would be the official one since four presidents--
dead, assassinated, ditched and rattling on, aré too short-termed to
be consistent in the public's eye. There are plans and consistency

and you would know them. All is not so incredible, but more serious--
with the shooting of a president and two presidential candidates

I will be happy to help educate the public -- by distributing
your reply.

Sincerely,

Lilith LVlben

Edwin A. Walker
