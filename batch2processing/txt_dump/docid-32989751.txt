NOTE: By request dated 3-15-78, the HSCA, among other items, asked for
access to the Field Office files of Atlanta, Los Angeles, Memphis, and
New York concerning the King and Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC) security investigations. On 3-28-78, HSCA Staff Member Michael

Eberhardt modified this request eliminating New York and requesting files
outlined above.

 

According to figures available at FBIHQ, the volume of
material involved in Atlanta is 80 Sections, 8,321 serials, and in
Memphis, 18 Sections, 516 serials. Figures for Los Angeles are not
available because only a portion of the files are being requested.

The entire King and SCLC files in Los Angeles consist of approximately
18 Sections, 1,750 serials.

Deadline is necessary since HSCA has requested expeditious
handling of all its requests.
