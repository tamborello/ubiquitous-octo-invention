POTENTIAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE ACTION

“JEREY", Gescribed ia St. Louis letter 4/14/66 as a

recent releasee of the Missouri State Penitentiary where he

. Feportedly served time for a marcotic violation, hes sow been
Adentified as JEREY SPRAGGINS. He has been using the mame
JERRY PITCHFORD interchangeably. The Kansas City Division
hes advised he was released from the Missouri State Penitentiary
11/26/65 where he was serving a seven-year sentence for robbery
Be is described as a Negro male, born 10/18/43, Bt. Louis,
Missouri, Mis FBI identification record shows "ne was received :

+ at Missouri State Penitentiary 12/8/61; that he has prior arrests %
for suspected stealing and suspected robbery. No dispositions

are shown,

XN

\O\

 
 
  
   
   
  

It appears therefore that information which was
irculating among Communist Party (CP) members that he served
ime for a narcotics violation is mot true. Other information
ich has been developed now casts some doubt on statements by

HEL J, WALXER, Chairman of the Missouri District CP, that.
received his initial indoctrination in Marxism at a class |
eld in the Missouri State Penitentiary. It may be noted that
he Kansas City Division in its letter 6/16/66 states JEREY
rved part of bis robbery sentence at reformatories and away
om the Missouri State Penitentiary.

An anonymous letter was sent gusMiaul, oneran Secretary,
CP-USA, on June 22, 1966. This letter esc din 8t. Louis
letter June 15, 1966. Upon his return from the National CP
Convention, WALXER stated HALL discussed this letter with him
and gave it to him. WALKER furnished no other details regard-
ing his conversation with HALL and it is not known to what
extent, if any, HALL queried WALXER regarding the possibility
that narcotics users and an ex-convict are being placed in
positions of leadership by the CP in St. Louis. WALKER expressed
a desire to determine the identity of the writer of the letter.
Be did not indicate what action, if any, he might take if the
culprit is uncovered.

It appears therefore that the full impact of this
counterintelligence action may well lie in the future.

As a result of the second proposed counterintelligence
action recommended in 8t. Louis letter June 15, 1966, an articl

appeared in the "St. Louis Globe rat", July 2-3, 1966, ,
containing a photograph of RONA BERG, DCA Coordinator and |

DISRUPTION OF THE NEW LEFT

ne RR A tag mcr ea

ReBulet to Albany, 5/10/68.

    
   

 

New Left activity in the St.Louis Division is
concentrated in the headquarters city. Principal organizations
involved in this movement are as follows:

Action Committee to Increase Opportunities for Negroes
(ACTION; . a“ .

Students for Democratic Society (SDS);
St. Louis Draft Resistance (SLDR);
The Committee to Support Draft Resistance (CSDR).

ACTION is basically a racial type organization. It
consists of a small group of individuals who split from the
St. Louis Chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)
several years ago in belief that CORE was not sufficiently
militant. Its activities are irregular, depending almost
entirely on its chairman, PERCY GREEN. Communist Party efforts
to cultivate him have so far appeared unsuccessful; however,
some influence is exerted through ORVILLE LEACH, veteran Communist
Party member, who is chairman of the Community Relations Committee
of ACTION,

An immediate Counterintelligence Program concerning
the latter three organizations would be restricted because these .
organizations are all campus-type organizations and Washington
University and St.-Louis University will close for summer
vactions in the first week of June. _These organizations will
be virtually out of existance unt the schools GP. |! in Sep mber.

SL: 100-21213

St. Louis has pending investigations on these four
organizations and their leadership and will be alert to any
circumstances or conditions which might be utilized to good
advantage for Counterintelligence purposes.

In the past this office has used to good advantage
anonymous mailings in connection with Communist Party Counter-
intelligence. However, at this time the office has no specific -
publications in mind which might be suggested for Bureau approval,

The feeding of well chosen information to the St. Louis
Globe Democrat, a local newspaper, whose editor and associate
editor, are extrémely friendly to the Bureau and the St. Louis
Office, has also been utilized in the past and it is contemplated
that this technique might be used to good advantage in connection

with this program.

 
  
  

With specific regard to thst. Louis Draft Resistance, Mi
which is a one-man organization headed\by .RICHARD_H SXFREER,
a Washington University graduate student, the following
circumstances occurred: M0
. J.

FREER turned in his Selective Service draft card at a
public meeting on 12/4/67. Investigation-at his local board
determined that a few days later he wrote to the board requesting
a duplicate card. If this type of information could have been
publicized, it might have pointed out the insincerity of FREER.
Nothing, however, was done at the time because of the confidential
nature of draft board records and the fact that publicity may
have jeopardized prosecution presently pending against FREER,

  
 
 
  

St. Louis will carefully analyze these organizations

under this program in an effort to affect the disruption of the
New Left and specific suggestions of Counterintelligence action
will be submitted to the Bureau for approval by separate letter.

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE: This matter has been coordinated with Legal Counsel

Division which, in turn, has coordinated with Deputy
Assistant Attorney General Robert L. Keuch, U. S. Department
of Justice, who has authorized release of the four specific
documents, in addition to the identification record, to the
former HSCA. In the context of the documents, it appears
that two persons on the "St. Louis Globe Democrat" in 1968
were utilized by the FBI on a confidential basis in connec~
tion with certain Cointelpro operations. Excisions have
been made to protect the identities of these persons, at
least one of whom is currently affiliated with that paper.
Contact with SAC, St. Louis, discloses no information to
contravene the confidential relationship discerned in
documents 100-449698-42-1 and 7.
