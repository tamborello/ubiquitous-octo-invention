ADMINISTRATIVE (Cont.):

ae oman

IP T-4 is CG 6512-C-TE, whose identity is
known to the Bureau.

Requests for coverage by highly confidential sources have
been refused by the Bureau in regards to ZIZZO and GRUTTADAURO, since
both are under investigation in substantive cases.

A request for similar coverage on FORMUSA's activities
is being withheld at this time pending his recovery and release from
a Chicago hospital.

A request for coverage by highly confidential sources
regarding MORGANO has been refused by the Bureau since the location
of intended source did not appear to be a meeting place where infor-
mation of value could be obtained, Further, MORGANO has been free on
bond in a local bribery case, and in addition, under deportation
orders from the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

‘ADURO, also known as Anthony

On September 18, 1962, Confidential Informant IP T-2
advised SA HAMILTON that since FRANK NICK ZIZZO, FBI #1538814,
has been indicted by the Federal Grand Jury in Hammond, In
GRUTTADAURO is now in charge of all Lake County, Indiana’ gambling
activities.

On November 20, 1962, Confidential Informant IP T-3
advised SA JAMES E, DOYLE that ANTHONY GRUTTADAURO is in charge
of all football-basketball parlay cards distributed throughout
the Hammond-Gary area. IP T-3 advised that GEORGE CVITKOVICH,
also known as GEORGE CORY, a present East Chicago, Indiana City
Councilman, formeriy handled football~basketball parlay cards for
GRUTTADAURO in East Chicago, Indiana, but this assignment had been
taken from him when he became City Councilman. IP T-3 stated
that CASIMIR ZAWADA, also known as CASEY, a runner for these par-
lay-cards, wanted CVITKOVICH’s job, but did not get it, in favor
of EDMUND MILOZEWSKI, Hammond, Indiana, a relative of.CVITKOVICH.

IP T-3 has previously advised that about three years ago
a dispute arose over one week's parlay cards involving winners
making it necessary for IP T-3 to contact the man in charge of
these parlay cards. He stated that shortly thereafter, FRANK NICK
ZIZZO, whom IP T-~3 advised is in charge of all bookmaking in the
Calumet area, appeared at IP T-3's place of business, and intro-
duced the informant to ANTHONY GRUTTADAURO, whom he advised was
in charge of the parlay cards in this area.

 

On June 26, 1962, ZIZZO, along with employees WALTER
WOJCIECHOWSKI, HUGO LAZZARESCHI, and ALEX STROSKY, were indicted
by a Federal Grand Jury, Northern District of Indiana, Hammond,
for violations of Interstate Transportation in Aid of Racketeering
Statute and Conspiracy to Violate Interstate Transportation in Aid
of Racketeering Statutes. All four individuals were arrested by
U.S. Marshals, and on July 31, 1962, appeared in U.S. District
Court, Hammond, Federal Judge GEORGE N, BEAMER presiding, and
through attorney EDWARD J. CALIHAN, Chicago, Illinois, entered not
guilty pleas to a 20 count indictment outstanding against them.
