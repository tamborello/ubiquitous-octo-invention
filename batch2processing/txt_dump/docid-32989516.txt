By nitel dated September 4, 1975, ‘the Bureau set
forth new procedures relating to interviews of current and

_In the above reference, the Bureau advised that, the FBI has .

- pledged full cooperation with this committee and also desired
to.set forth a new procedure relating to committee staff :
interviews of current and former FBI employees. .

in the past, the Bureau has frequently learned

from thé committee. or otherwise that former employees are
being considered for interview by the committee staff. Upon
learning of thése proposed interviews, the field officé is

instructed to contact the former employee to alert him of.
the possible interview, remind him of his confidentiality |
agreement with the Bureau and suggest that if-he is contacted . -
for interview he may contact the Legal Counsel Division by.
collect call for further information. The prospective

_ interviewees should further be told that if they desire
-assistance in the form of consultation with the Bureau
during interview, they may contact personally (if interview
is in Washington, D.C.) or by collect call to Assistant
Director of the Intelligence Division, Mr. W.R. WANNALL,

SENSTUDY 75

Captioned matter pertains to our office's handling of
requests from Senate and House Select Committees to study
governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities.
In connection with the work of these committees, staffmembers
may seek to interview current and former FBI employees.

Recently, the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff has
interviewed several former employees, and it is anticipated that
many more such personnel will be contacted.

The FBI has pledged full cooperation with the Committee,
and we wish to assist and facilitate any investigations undertaken
by the committee with respect to the FBI, However, we do have
an obligation to insure that sensitive sources and methods and
ongoing sensitive investigations are fully protected. Should any
former employee contact our office and have any question regarding
his obligation not to divulge information obtained by virtue of his
past FBI employment, he should be instructed to contact Legal
Counsel, FBIHQ, by collect call. Your conversations with former
employees must be in keeping with our pledge. It is believed
such @ procedure would insure proper protection and also facilitate
the work of the SSC,

The above procedure also applies to current employees
of our office. However, contact with the Legal Counsel should
be handled through the SAC.
