Mr. Schwarz. Now if I might put this document in
chronological context for the Committee, the persons in Santo
Domingo are at this point seeking permission to pass machine
guns to the dissidents who they know are seeking those machine
guns in order to assassinate Trujillo, and there is a block
put on this shipment -- rather, to the passage of them; they
had already been shipped to the Dominican Republic -- and a
draft cable was prepared authorizing the passage and then it
was said, no, we've got to go check with State to determine
whether the machine guns should be passed.

And this memorandum reflects the checking with State, he

apparently came to see Mr. Berle..

Further, as a matter of information, thee who (/ (a

was referred to in here, did know that other assassination
weapons had béen passed to the dissidents.
Now given that background, I will read the memorandum
into the record and I will have one question for the witness. (//)
| CIA came in. A local group in the
Dominican government wishes to overthrow Trujillo; wishes arms
for that purpose.

*-86n cross-examination it developed that the real plan was
to assassinate. Trujillo and they wanted guns for that purpose.

"I told him I could not care less for Trujillo and that

jsaid he felt the same way."

 

Now, Mr. Secretary, in the way which your understanding wa

of the expected degree of candor between CIA and the State

Department, would it be your expectation that if gingg

had known that other weapons had been passed to the same

 

dissidents and they had stated that they intended to use those

other weapons to assassinate Mr. Trujillo, that Quay

should have passed that information on to Mr. Berle?

 

Mr. Rusk. Under those circumstances, I would think the

answer is yes.

,

I mean, one thing I'm sure of, Mr. Schwarz, and that is
Mr. Berle did not write this Memorandum on May 3rd, 1961 in
preparation for a Senate investigation in 1975.

Mr. Schwarz. You believe it to reflect accurately what
transpired?

Mr. Rusk. I have no doubt. It was sent to Mr. Coerr, Mr.

Owen, Mr. Devine, in the Department of State, and I've known

Mr. Berle for quite a long time and I would have predicted this

would have been his reaction.
Senator Mathias. Mr. Chairman, just at this point --
The Chairman. Senator Mathias.

Senator Mathias. It would be interesting to get the

Secretary|'s reflection that if that is the case, as Mr. Berle's

memorandum indicates and as the Secretary said, how do you in
