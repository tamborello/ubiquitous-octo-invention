Informant has advised that ANGELO BRUNO is borrowing
the automobile registered to his office manager, RALPH SCHWARTZ,
periodically to make hasty trips from the City of Philadelphia
to unknown locations. This automobile is a 1963 Chevrolet

the odometer reflected that ANGELO BRUNO had traveled
approximately 800 miles on this trip, 400 miles to his des-
tination and 400 miles returning.

II. The following information was obtained from
PH 677-C-TE on 4/17/64 and is of such a sensitive nature that
it is not being placed in the body of this report in order to
preclude his compromise: ”

PH 677-C-TE advised that PETER MAGGIO had prepared
stuffed brown envelopes marked "CHARLES COSTELLO," and addi-
tional markings which could not be seen; however, those which
could be seen are noted as follows:

Item No. 1

Item No. 3 contains 11 figures, indicating either a collection
or dispersement of funds in the amount of $160,000 for the
Trenton, N. J. - Philadelphia, Pa. group.

The identities of the parties in Item No. 2 appear
to the Philadelphia agents to be as follows:

BERNARD ALLEN would meet NORMAN FROMKIN in Columbia, S. C.,
during the weeks 10/11-24/64 in case BRUNO would like to meet
FROMKIN who was scheduled to leave the Dominican Republic
approximately 10/10/64.

On 11/17/64, informant advised that BEN GOLOB had
written another letter addressed to RALPH SCHWARTZ at Penn
Jersey Vending Company, 775 South Eighth Street, Philadelphia,
bearing the postmark Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. GOLOB was
complaining in this letter that he has written several letters to
BRUNO through RALPH SCHWARTZ but BRUNO has not seen fit to answer
or assist GOLOB in securing a better position in the Dominican
Republic.

Informant advised that BRUNO had more or less "cut
off" GOLOB even though he is now paying him $125 per week for
employment at Coney Island in the Dominican Republic. Informant
stated that he believes BRUNO cannot completely cut off GOLOB
because GOLOB "knows too much of BRUNO's business and activities."
GOLOB is continuing his efforts to obtain the removal of NORMAN
FROMKIN as manager of Coney Island for BRUNO and BERNARD "BUCKY"
ALLEN.

On 11/28/64, ANGELO BRUNO instructed his office manager,
RALPH SCHWARTZ, not to accept any telephone calls from BEN GOLOB
of the Dominican Republic. Informant stated that GOLOB and BRUNO
are continuing their feud.

is a member of La Cosa Nostra and is in occasional contact with
ANGELO BRUNO. BUFALINO resides in upstate Pennsylvania and ff
makes his headquarters in the Pottstown and Hazleton, Pa., area.
BUFALINO was in attendance at the Apalachin meeting in November
1957.

At 1:35 p.m., 9/9/64, ANGELO BRUNO requested his office
manager, RALPH SCHWARTZ, to contact RUSSELL BUFALINO, who was in
Philadelphia staying at the Sylvania Hotel, Broad and Locust
Streets. Informant advised that SCHWARTZ attempted to contact
BUFALINO but was unsuccessful. Informant did not know if BUFALINO

NORMAN FROMKIN told RALPH SCHWARTZ on 9/27/64 that he
intended to visit the United States in the near future and he
gave RALPH SCHWARTZ a long list of machine parts for bingo
machines which he needs to make necessary repairs to existing
equipment. He wanted ANGELO BRUNO to obtain the parts and to
advance the money to.defray the cost. FROMKIN was ordering
these parts through JAMES CLEMENT, manufacturer of coin machine
parts and equipment, 948 West Russell Street, Philadelphia, Pa.
The Coney Island parent. company is to be charged for the parts
under the name of MARQUINAS de DIVERSIONES C par A, Coney
Island, Dominican Republic.

On 10/13/64, RALPH SCHWARTZ received a telephone call
from NORMAN FROMKIN, who was calling from the Dominican Republic.
FROMKIN complained that he had not received the parts which he
had ordered from ANGELO BRUNO to fix the bingo machines. FROMKIN
told SCHWARTZ reportedly that BRUNO should call him back right
away.

On 10/16/64, ANGELO BRUNO, while accompanied by FRANK
NICOLETTI in front of the Broad Street Trust Company at Eighth
and Christian Streets, Philadelphia, was observed reading a letter
which he had received in the’ mail from BEN GOLOB of the Dominican
Republic. This letter informed BRUNO that NORMAN FROMKIN is
sending BERNARD ALLEN $300 per week. The letter-also-stated that
JQE LEESON’ has four slot machines located in the refineries
without BRUNO's knowledge.

The letter also stated that FROMKIN had met with BERNARD
"BUCKY" ALLEN several ‘months: previously without. informing~BRUNO of
this. ‘GOLOB*also informed BRUNO that his accountant; JOE’ WILSON,
did not’ sent: GOLOB his’ 1963 income tax return. The letter-also in-
formed. BRUNO that NORMAN FROMKIN has a meeting scheduled with
BERNARD ALLEN during the: latter part of October, which meeting |
will take place in the State of North Carolina.

a letter. to BRUNO, which letter was addressed to RALPH SCHWARTZ,
775 South. Eighth Street, Philadelphia. The letter indicated that

FROMKIN was feigning illness and did-.not appear.

Following dinner they went back to the hotel where
RALPH SCHWARTZ was introduced to PAT SLOT, owner of the
casino at the El Embajador. SLOT is from Jacksonville, Fla.
SLOT. pointed out that JOE WILLIAMS was from Jacksonville, Fla.,
and WILLIAMS is now helping SLOT in the operation of the casino,
which operates, at a $50.00 limit for it has three blackjack
tables, and a $10.00 limit, having three roulette wheels which
are set up at odds of 35 to 1. The clientele are principally
Dominicans.

Subsequently, GOLOB took RALPH SCHWARTZ.to Coney Island
where he was introduced to JOHN JOHNS, a Lebanese, who resides in
Florida and who is a partner with LOU LEVINSON at the Coney Island
casino. JOHNS was booking baseball games in the casino and has
worked as a partner with "SLEEP-OUT LOUIE" for more than 30 years.

At Coney Island, JOE LEESON is employed, having origi-
nally been sent to Coney Island by BERNARD "BUCKY" ALLEN and
LEVINSON, and on his own is operating bingo and pinball machines
at the sugar mills. GOLOB has a dozen machines located in the
country club which he operated until NORMAN FROMKIN took them
from him and gave the machines and the concession.to LEESON. GOLGB
is netting $125 a week from Coney Island.

Coney Island is principally a large park with many
children's amusements and has a very huge hall for bingo or
blackjack on one side of the park and pinwheels, which are con-
cessioned out, on the other side of the park. They have two
offices in the casino in a large kitchen. The restaurant, the .
luncheonette, and the bingo machines operating there are con-
cessioned out. They have one large store room in which are
stored between 70 to 100 "one-armed bandits."

On the following day, 9/22/64, RALPH SCHWARTZ had
breakfast with SILVER RICH, who is originally from Cleveland,
Ohio, and who has worked’in Las Vegas. LOU LEVINSON arrived
and began castigating NORMAN FROMKIN, stating that LEVINSON

Republic for protection to operate Coney Island, but according

to gossip in the Dominican Republic (according to LOU LEVINSON),
FROMKIN is only paying $1500 a month and is pocketing the balance.
LEVINSON instructed SCHWARTZ to be certain that this message was
brought to ANGELO BRUNO's attention.

BEN GOLOB was checking the incoming flights to Santo
Domingo daily to determine if punch boards he had ordered were
aboard. GOLOB intends to set up the operation, of the punch
boards with no partners; however, BRUNO made the remark the
week previous to 9/21/64 to AL SILVERBERG and FRANK NICOLETTI
that if BEN does not cut BRUNO in on the punch boards, he will
send GOLOB back to Florida. Punch boards are illegal in the
Dominican Republic, and GOLOB is afraid that FROMKIN will in-
form the Minister of Justice of GOLOB's proposed activities.

On Wednesday, 9/23/64, GOLOB again took RALPH SCHWARTZ
to Coney Island.

On 9/24/64, they again visited Coney Island.

On 9/26/64, during the evening hours, HEINIE arrived and
was. introduced to RALPH SCHWARTZ and BEN GOLOB. HEINIE complained
to SCHWARTZ that FROMKIN tried to put the squeeze on HEINIE to get
him out of the Dominican Republic, informing the Minister of
Justice that HEINIE was operating the numbers business in Santo
Domingo. HEINIE settles up his accounts every two weeks. He is
residing outside of Coral Gables, Fla., and was scheduled to
enter the Veterans Administration Hospital in that area on 10/3/64
or 10/4/64 for a physical.

The Espanol Hotel, Santo Domingo, has a casino which is
operated by Cubans. This group reportedly will take over the
casino:at Coney Island. FROMKIN was to deal with.them on 10/4/64
to-make arrangements for the take-over when LEVINSON leaves.
LEVINSON allegedly is giving up the casino operation at Coney
Island because of his reluctance to continue dealing with NORMAN
FROMKIN.
