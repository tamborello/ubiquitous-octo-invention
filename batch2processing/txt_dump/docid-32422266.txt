1. The salary paid to CISCO-26 in Caracas would, at least as «
begiming salary, be somewhat too high for Mexico, although the Station is
prepared to raise his salary after six months or so, provided the quality and
quentity of the information provided by him is sufficient. Assuming that no
part of his salary will have to be diverted so LCINMATE, it is suggested that
he start off in Mexico with a monthly salary of US$ 150.00. That amount should
allow him to live reasonably comfortably and pay his normal school expenses.
