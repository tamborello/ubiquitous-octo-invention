ReBu airtel 7/9/64, advised that CIA, on 7/8/64,
reported that the information in the 4/8/64 CIA memorandum
came from two sources. CIA, however, did not have their
identities available. CIA advised that it was instructing
CIA, Miami, to furnish the Miami Office the identities of
the sources involved, and to make the sources available to
the Miami Office for interview.
On 7/10/64 ,{Li42 Ieee J CIA, covert, Miami, ad-
- vised that it would be necessary for him to confer with his
headquarters prior to revealing the sources of information.

On 7/13/64, J “stated he was still discussing
the matter with his headquarters, and would notify the
@ Miami Office when the sources were available.

It ts noted that referenced Bu airtel refers spec-
ifically to the sources in the memorandum dated 4/8/64. in
view of the conflicting information obtained through inter-
view of TEOFILO BABUN SELMAN and his associates, ELISEO
GOMEZ FERNANDEZ and OSCAR FERNANDEZ VEIGA and the informa-

‘tion obtained through interview of JULIO LOBO at.New York, a

it would be of interest to the Miami Office to have the
sources of the information set out in the CIA memorandum of
6/10/64, available for interview, particularly with regard
to the information appearing in Paragraphs 3, 6 and 8.

we The Bureau is requested to advise whether the
uk uf question of making these, sources available for interview
t a by the Miami Office was discussed with CIA.
