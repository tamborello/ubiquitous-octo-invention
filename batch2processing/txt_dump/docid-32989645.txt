on 5/31/Te<ed A 6596-SAdvised DELLA COOVER is
using the pseudonym Bélla Stumboy so this matter has been

marked "changed"

   
   

 

CSLA indicated CCOVER is using the Bella Stumnbo
alias in connec sion with her position as a start writer Tor
the "hos Angeles Times"

ACTION
tf ADEX should ve changed to include the new alias and
subject's position as a staff writer for the Times Also,

since subject is writing under a still different pseudonym,
for the Monterey Park Progress newspapers, it is suggested
that consideration be given to advising the Internal Revenue
Service that she may be receiving payroll checks under these
pseudonyms and not reporting her total income correctly. Appro~
priate investigation should be conducted to verify subject's
use of the additional pseudonym.
