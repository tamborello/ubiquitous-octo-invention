AT NEW ORLEANS LOUISIANA, 1) Will verify birth of
FRANK CARACCT on 10 12 29.

2) Will report appellate < court decision on CARACGI's
U. S. District Court conviction for bribing an IRS Agent.

 

3) Will conduct surveillance of” CARACCI to determine
his’current activities and to determine if he still maintains
personal contact with CHARLIE, PACE of Palace Amusement Company.

4) Will interview “NICK KARNO and FRANKIE FORD to
determine their-current financial interest in the 500 Club and
the 500 Backstage Bar. :

ADMINISTRATIVE:

7 On 12/14/70, NO 1899- PC advised SA TERRY D. PETERS,
that he-had seen FRANK CARACCI at‘ the racetracks on 12/12/70
standing at the bar, east end of ‘the ‘grandstand where the
horses come onto the track. Informant~stated that~CARACCI
has been seen at the track on an almost daily basis.

nO On 12/9/70, NO 1075- C advised SA L.°M.’ SHEARER, JR.
that CHARLIE PACE was quite upset by’ the FBI-raid in November,
1970, but not because stolen property was-found., Informant
stated that’ PACE was upset because of something that will get
him into trouble with his associates for’the loss ‘of~the
machines’and the money. An-employee mentioned that it was
something done behind FRANK's (CARACCI) back.” Informant ~
believes that PACE fears that FederalsAgents will find out

that he is shylocking, charging as much as 60 per cent interest
on loans and no record is kept once the loan is paid off.

NO 1075-C advised that many banksloans are made to
customers of Blace Amusement which are co-signed by PACE and
CARAGCI; however, some of their customers could not get bank

loans and these-must pay the high interest if-they want
money. Some of these high interest loans “are made through
Rex's Finance Company ; however, if inquiry is made concerning
the’ loan after it is paid, no record can be found’and the
company will not acknowledge that such a loan existed.

On 3/18/72, ~NO 1203- (© advised SA WILLIAM F. KUSCH
that SIDNEY (LNU), who’ may be identical to SIDNEY LAZARD,
acts as a go-between for FRANK CARACCI and the sport bookee.
CARACCI needs a go-between because he bets on’ winners so often |
that many bookees are afraid to take his action. Informant ~
stated that SIDNEY takes CARACCI's action, some of which he
books himself, and some of which he lays off to T. J. TILLMAN,
with whom CARACCI cannot get done with. :

New Orleans indices reflect that SIDNEY LAZARD is a
prominent New Orleans attorney and is known to be a degenerate
bettor. ‘T. J. TILLMAN is the subject of New Orleans file
165-1477.
