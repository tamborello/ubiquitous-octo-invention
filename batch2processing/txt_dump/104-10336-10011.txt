informal request number 12 (CIA IR 12) from the staff of the
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB). A classified
response will also be provided to be more specific and
detailed. The staff has requested information about contacts
with journalists or publishing houses, that is to what
extent, if any, CIA might have attempted to influence any
journalists or publishers regarding public discussion of the
assassination.

2. (U) The terms like “journalists,” “publishers,”

projects that concern press and propaganda programs designed
to promote anti-Communism and to counter Soviet press and
propaganda initiatives worldwide. Specifically, these
various projects were developed for the following reasons:

A. to counter Soviet activities in international
intellectual organizations,.in order to unite and
promote anti-Communist intellectuals.

B. to be involved in book publishing matters and
the international distribution of anti-Communist books.

CIA-IR-12 Contacts with Journalists or Publishing Houses.

The Review Board seeks to determine.to what extent, if any, CLA might have
attempted to influence any journalists or publishers regarding public discussion
of the assassination. This request, originally discussed in March 1997, was raised
at the DO follow-up briefing on April 1, 1997. CIA has had no response and no
time frame for a response.

CIA-IR-13 Office or Person Dealing with Organized Crime and Cuba.

The Review Board requested that CLA make a particular personnel file available.
The file was made available by CIA for review. The Review Board seeks a full
and accurate formal response to this request detailing any and all searches made
and the results of those searches. Once a formal statement is provided, this
request will be complete.

CIA-IR-14 Breckinridge Files.

*CTA-

CIA (OGC) will determine the disposition of the files of Scott D. Breckinridge.
CIA has had no response and no time frame for a response.

IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City Station.

The Review Board has for some time been attempting to determine whether it
has had access to all of CIA’s surveillance “take” from the Cuban and Soviet
facilities in Mexico City at the time of the Oswald visit and in the immediate
wake of the assassination. On numerous occasions, the Review Board has asked
whether there was any surveillance take in addition to what i is currently in the
collection.

_ On March 18, 1997, the Review Board provided additional leads tg CIA to assist

it in answering these questions. The DO has agreed to check Headquarters
records for the file referenced in HMMW 12454, to search for the crypts cited in
this document, and to search for HMMA 20307 and other cables or dispatches
cited in this document.

In addition, the DS&T will query its offices for possible records on Mexico City
and Cuba and for the present location of Staff D records. Regardless of the

Re: Status of CLA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for
Additional Inforniation and Record:

 

Dear John:

Iam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board’s requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CLA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE ,
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.
