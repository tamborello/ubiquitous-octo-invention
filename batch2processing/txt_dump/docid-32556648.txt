Re Chicago LHM dated 3-16-65.

Investigation requested in referenced Chicago
memorandum was referred by letter to the Police Judiciaire
(Criminal Police), SGreté Nationale (PJSN), on 3-24-65.
Contact has been maintained with the.PJSN regularly to
obtain the results of their inquiry.

Mr. ALFRED GERTHOFFERT of the PJSN advised on
5-24-65 that investigation thus far had failed to locate
any record of three mink coats and jewelry having been
declared at the time FUEGER entered France. Mr. GERTHOFFERT
stated that it appears that this material was not questioned
by the French Customs and that no record was made of it
at the time she entered France. The investigation is con-
tinuing, however, and Mr. GERTHOFFERT will furnish us with
the final results thereof in the near future.

It is‘noted that Chicago memorandum indicates
that Chicago is awaiting further information regarding the
use of false identification by FUEGER while in Paris. The
results of that inquiry were contained in Paris letter
3-2-65. It was indicated that the question of false identity
apparently arose as a result of information having been
furnished erroneously by the Hotel Bristol. No further
inquiry is being conducted in that regard.

We wilitiGofitinue to follow with the PJSN and
