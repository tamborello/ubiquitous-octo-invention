materials which may have some relevance to the assassination were
located (referenced material inclosed at numbered tabs): ;

1.- Four ‘Cuban[ __ressages which contained
official Cuban comments regarding press items that discussed Oswald's
activity in late September 1963 to dktain a visa to travel to

Moscow. There were also comments on the assassination itself.
The messages are dated in the last week Of. November 1963.

2. Three Cuban military reports which show that Cuban
military forces did go on alert immediately after*the assassination.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 15 June 1978

SUBJECT: Actions Taken by NSA to Locate Information Related
to the Assassination of President Kennedy

A. Over the past fourteen and one-half years, NSA has
performed a number of separate in-depth reviews of materials in .
its files in an attempt to isolate data that might be relevant
to the assassination of President Kennedy. Nothing of significance
has been determined as a result of those reviews.

1. November-December 1963 - Immediately after the
assassination, NSAinitiated a large-scale manual and machine
review of available SIGINT, including all. U.S./Cuba traffic-(NSA
intercepted messages at an average of 1,000 per day at that time).
A computer search was initiated using Oswald's name as the minimum
for research criteria. Additionally, all traffic between Cuba/New
Orleans and Cuba/Dallas was manually reviewed (an analyst involved
recalled that 25 to 50 analysts reviewed the traffic manually,
along with traffic from Cuba and some Soviet traffic). Sometime
during the search, items from the Oswald address book provided by
the FBI were added to the search criteria.

2. 1964 - Warren Commission - The Commission, in the
person of Allan Dulles, asked NSA to review the exhibits for any
secret writings or codes which might have been contained in the
documents. It also appears that NSA searched records for information
on the basis of other Warren Commission requests made informally
by Allen Dulles.

3. November 1975 - Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC):

In response to an SSC request on the Assassination,
NSA reviewed its Soviet and Cuban files, including Cuban military.
The search was also for material involving Marina -Oswald, Jack Ruby
or Earl Ruby (a Harvest run was made). [ ___tratfic was also
reviewed, looking for information concerning Oswald's-wisit to
Mexico . : : 44USC2107(5)(g)(2)(D)

vost aseavsinstion fe product on a world-wide basis to determine
; if reports relevant to the assassination exist. Though Ms. Miller did
— not specify a time period, a three month period subsequent to the event
_would involve - as an example - six to nine thousand reports and would
xequire 120 to 150 hours of analyst time just to conduct a manual search
of the microfilm files where these records reside.

2. I subsequently spoke with Mr. Roger Denk, DIA, who had actually
participated in the briefing of Mr. Blakey, using our SECRET-level statement
as a basis. Mr. Denk advises that DIA has destroyed all its files which
might relate to the assassination and that, therefore, he had had nothing
to offer Blakey except the NSA-prepared sanitized statement. Mr. Denk also
‘provided a different, much more ambitious new requirement from Blakey than
that reported by Judy Miller.

3. According to Denk, what Blakey really wants from NSA is for us to
conduct a thorough review of all Cuban communications during the six year
period from January 1959 to December 1964, in order to see “what the Cubans
were talking about/thinking about" of possible relevance to the assassina-
tion ~ a real fishing expedition in my view. Blakey is also reported to
desire a "characterization of the traffic" - and not the traffic itself.

- 4. This latest version of Blakey's interests, which has probably
been stated to us fairly accurately by Denk, represents a very significant
work load indeed. Based on some very educated estimates made by the
people in T12 who maintain the historical microfilm files, ‘there were
approximately 200,000 Cuban reports or translations issued during the six
year period of interest, and roughly 2,000 man-hours of effort would he
required to search these records for items of interest.

5. As we nave discussed previously, I believe that NSA - in a number
of separate, thorough analytic efforts - has performed reasonable and
detailed reviews of all available signals intelligence. None of these
reviews has resulted in the derivation of any data of direct significance
to the assassination. A summary of these separate NSA efforts is attached.

It seems to me that this summary should now be used as the basis for advising
Mr. Blakey that we have reviewed all our holdings and have found nothing
directly (or even indirectly) relevant to his investigation.
