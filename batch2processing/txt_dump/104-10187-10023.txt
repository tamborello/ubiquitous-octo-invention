B. Raymond ica GERENDE Segment (discussed in relat ion to project
objectives):

1, “To gollect operational information perta ining to LIMERICK

. personel and physical facilitles through use of photographic base houses, '

‘Three phorogrsphic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to.this objective. ‘To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual ~
description of the. functions of these three bases and how they contribute

to the above abjective. ‘This was described in detait In the 1960 Request for | -

Project Renewal, (HMMA-15979) _

2. “To collect operattonal information and tdentify operational

leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity," The LIENTRAP operation,

handled by GERENDE, is st{ll the major contributor to this objeciive, :
Among LIENTRAP'S regular and extensive photographie assignments, was
the photo stakeout of prominent Mexican Communists (some of whom have
never been photographed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party
Headquarters, During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover

the recent move of PCM Headquarters (the first information Station had

of the move) and to continue photo surveillance at the new site,

_3, “Yo provide operational support to Staticn operations, t.e, ,
rent hotel rooms and apart ments, and-conduct counter-surveillances, '
GERENDE is usec frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
‘Station operarl ioas and activities, GERENDE’s comprehensive area
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
extremely valuable Sation agyset for such support activities, GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many

con Relationship to’ Related Mission Directive. Objectives:

As stated tn previous project renewals, ‘it can readily be noted that” ~
Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in *
this manner has becn a contributhig factor to the furtherance of the Related
Mission Directive, The project has not produced any positive intelligence
nor has it been intended that it should do so, The project's sole purpose
is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information
In support. of other Station operat ions,

_ CHANGES

There have been no 5 changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the
past project ycar atfecting elther objectives or personnel,

_EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPT Y which would alter
the validity of the remarks made in Section IH of 1960 project renewal re-

quest (IMMA: 15979)

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation,
which was described in 1940- renewal request, is still present but has
caused no known difficulty, At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-~-9736, the
LICALLA.base was reactivated on-29 May 1961, The base operator con-
tinues co be alert for any unusual Inctdeats which might indicate that the

base has been comprorntsed,

PLANS_

The Station considers that the project is operating at its optimum
size and does not, plan to expand it during the coming year, Efforts will
be continued to refine and betrer utilize the extsting project organizational
arrangements, As in the past, the Station will continue its efforis tu

improve the compartmentation. and Sra of the project,
