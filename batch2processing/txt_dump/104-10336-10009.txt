Introduction

The Review Board staff reviewed the CIA Inspector General’s Survey Report for 1964,
part of which dealt with the Mexico City Station, to determine whether it contained
information related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The Review Board
requested access to this document because it dealt with Mexico City surveillance
operations during the time of Lee Harvey Oswald’s visit to that city in the fall of 1963.
Because most of this report falls outside the scope of the Review Board’s mandate, and
contains information on sensitive intelligence operations, CLA opposes the full release

. of this document. There are, however, certain sections of the report-that make

reference to the assassination as well as enhance the understanding of the scope of CIA
technical surveillance during the 1963-64 time-frame. In compliance with the JFK Act,
the Review Board has requested CIA to open only those Particular sections that it has
determined to be relevant to the assassination.

Overall Assessment

The 1964 IG Report was devoted to describing and assessing the value of various CIA
operations, including technical and operational details, the majority of which
concerned the Mexico City.Station. While most of this document contains material not
believed relevant (NBR) to the assassination, there were sections covering Mexico City
surveillance operations, references to the Warren Commission, and to the station’s
contribution to collecting information on some of Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in
Mexico City. There was also a section that referred to Mexico City’s registry and Chief

of Station files which station personnel used to retrieve information on Oswald after the
assassination. Several sections on Cuban and Soviet operations are also considered
relevant because of Lee Harvey Oswald's reputed visits to those embassies. The
Review Board determined that, for the most part, these pertinent sections contain much
of the same information has already been opened in other documents released by the
Board. However, the fact that the IG report made a point of mentioning the station’s
role in gathering intelligence on Oswald, presumably to demonstrate the value of the

station, is certainly of interest. The Staff will negotiate with CIA staff to have the

pertinent sections of the document processed in accordance with the JFK Act.
Summary of NBR Sections of the Report:

The report provided a comprehensive survey of CIA operations and activities in the
early 1960's, most of which dealt with the Mexico City station. Based on their
familiarity with other records on this subject matter, the staff determined that these
sections did not contain information relevant to the events of the assassination. The
main subjects of the report are as follows: a general history of the station and U.S.-
Mexico relations; description and objectives of technical operations; operations against
Cuban and Soviet targets; anti-communist activities; operations in other locations; ©
future operations, administrative details; an assessment of the station’s intelligence
value; and a section on quality of life issues.

Summary of AR sections of the IG Report which should be processed:

In addition to the references to Lee Harvey Oswald, the Kennedy assassination and the
Warren Commission, the IG report also contains certain operational details that are
relevant to understanding some of the events surrounding the assassination. The
sections that the Review Board designated for release are summarized as follows:

e Cuban Operations. Discussion of transit visas: p. 2, para..#6; type of surveillance
that was or wasn’t in place at the time of Oswald's visit.p. 3, para. #9; reference
to JMWAVE station and Cuban activities p. 4, para.#11-12.

° Soviet Operations. References to assassination of President Kennedy, Lee Harvey
Oswald and the Warren Commission with additional technical information that
has already been released: p. 8, para. #19; p. 9, para. #20; p. 10, para. # 23; and p.
11, para. 24.

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

 

Dear John:

_ Lam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious

concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board’s requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now

extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct

a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April. 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the’
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CLA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CLA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CLA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CLA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

CIA-IR-09 George Bush Computer Search.

The Review Board provided CIA with a copy of an FBI document, dated
November 29, 1963, prepared under the name of John Edgar Hoover, which
States: “The substance of the foregoing information {on the assassination of
President Kennedy] was orally furnished to Mr. George Bush of the Central
Intelligence Agency ....” We have been informed that the DO has no record of a
“George Bush” being in the employ of CIA in 1963 with the exception of
Mr. George William Bush who has already given a sworn affidavit that he is not
the “George Bush” in question. It is our understanding that the CIA has
confirmed that the search query included George Herbert Walker Bush prior to
1970. CIA sHould determine whether George Herbert Walker Bush is the person
to whom the memorandum refers and should provide a definitive statement
regarding the scope of its search and the basis of its conclusion. Any and all
personnel files of George Herbert Walker Bush should be reviewed to determine
- whether he had any affiliation with CIA during the 1963 period. Once the formal
statement is provided, this request will be complete.

CIA-IR-10 IG Reports.

CIA will determine whether the IG’s office maintains an index or inventory of its
reports and determine whether the IG’s office prepared a report on the handling
of Oswald. Since April 1997, CIA has had no response and no time frame for a
response.

CIA-IR-11 Warren Commission Critics.

We are asking that CIA determine whether it possesses any files or records on
Warren Commission critics Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane,
Harold Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher. The Review Board is not requesting
information per se regarding any FOIA requests by these individuals or any
Public Affairs news clippings.* Since April 1997, CIA has had no response and
no time frame for a response.

>To the extent that CIA possesses FOIA files or records on any of these

individuals, and to the extent that those records contain information that was not filed
with the courts, such records are being requested for review by the Review Board.
