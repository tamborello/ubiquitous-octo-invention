tention of the Miami Division to the fact that CHARLES A,
NORRIS, States Attorney for St. Marys County, Maryland had
been indicted on 8/8/63 for malfeasance in office as a result

Informant, was formerly the subject of a WSTA investigation
conducted by the WFO Division wherein she received a sentence
for WSTA activities. She is also a very close associate of
subject NESLINE.

_ Informant advised that during the conference, TOURINE
and NESLINE requested their attorneys to make contact with the
States Attorney of St. Marys County, Maryland, CHARLES A, NORRIS.
Subsequently NCRRIS reportedly met with RAFT, TOURINE, NESLINE,
BAILEY and WEINER in the law offices of WEINER and BAILEY. It
was the desire of TOURINE and NESLINE to have StateS Attorney
NORRIS agree to a request of the defense at the hearing of the
appeal of TOURINE and NESLINE from their conviction of their
sentence on the gambling arrest on 6/13/63 at Charlotte Hall,
Maryland. TOURINE and NESLINE wanted to be assured that the
States Attorney would agree to their request that when they
plead guilty, that maximum fines would be leveled and suspended jail
sentences imposed. . a

Sheriff of St. Marys County, Maryland advised SA LOWE that he
had learned from a close source of his, that PAUL J, BAILEY

had approached this source for the purpose of determining if

a statement could be reached by the defense and the States
Attorney in connection with the appeal. BURROUGHS stated

that BAILEY was attempting to determine if it would be agreeable
with the County Commissioners of St. Marys County to state in
Court that maximum fines in this case would be most desirable

on the part of the St. Marys County Commissioners to assist
the.County Treasury. The chairman of the County Commissioners,
ELLIOTT BURCH, had indicated that no such statement was agreeable
with his office and in fact, his office wanted "hands off".

By airtel dated 10/23/63, WFO advised that’ on 10/22/63
