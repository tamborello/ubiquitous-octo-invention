ReBulet 1/2/64 and New Orleans letter ate)

The lamps previously altered by the FBI Laboratory se
containing radio microphone have been tested in the room

normally occupied by MARCELLO at. the Town House Motel, :

Lafayette, La., and they appear to work satisfactorily in that ~
transmissions are clearly received in the adjacent room.

An actual installation has not been effected on
MARCELLO to date in view of the fact that he has been known 4
to be in Lafayette on two occasions since the equipment has
been checked. On one occasion he stayed at the Holiday Inn
Motel and on the second occasion he stayed at the Town House
Motel, however, his reservations were made in another person's {
name.

In view of the fact that MARCELLO will occasionally .
utilize the Holiday Inn Motel when he goes to Lafayette, UACB *
a survey will be conducted to determine the feasibility of
an installation in the Holiday Inn Motel.
