OBSERVATIONS:

 

; ) ae
A total of Gi technical installations are in operation

as of 2/13/61. @ne iS“being installed and two others e. been

| recommended. This installation would make a total of B15) We have
technical coverage ongeas offices which now occupy the premises
formerly used by the Cuban Embassy {$)However, it is known that

Pino is a "lone wolf" and some of ‘the threatening calls ;reportedly

were made at night which would indicate possibility that they were

made from Pino's residence, It appears likely that State

Department would be interested in this coverage and we also

would be in a position to determine definitely if Pino is engaged

in intelligence activities.

ACTION:

y

 

If you approve, liaison should discuss this matter
with appropriate State Department official and determine if
technical coverage of Pino's residence at Silver Spring,
Maryland, is desired. Maximum security of the installation

has been assured by the Washington Field ¢ffice. uy . !
