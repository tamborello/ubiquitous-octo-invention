Ponstble Contineensy. The rumored uprising of the Cuban
people in mid-June continues to be watched closely. The CIA
coveraze inside Cuba hae not confirmed this uprising from
resistance orzanizations there, and ovill consludes that this is
an aitempt by the Castro regime to get oppancats to come cut
into the open, Where tusy con oa dealt with, It is believed
: worth some extra intelligence effort to keepa close cye on
. . possible cevelopments in Cuba in thia peri ad, and the Group is
being asked separately to approve meang for cvineg 69. f.cane
while, Ux. iciro Cardona issued a warning (wenile in Costa Rica)

- to Cubans not to revoll prematurely; thin was picked up Ly press
services and played back into Cuba by VOA and other information
mrans.

 

 

In response to the Group's cesire for ready p Jana in case of
eimilar contingencies in the future, Defense has been tasked with
cevelozing a plan in case of a surprise wide-spread revolt and State
has been tasked with developing a companion plan in case of &
localized revalt (ine provincial city, ete.). The Group will be
inforined of these plang when campleted.
