Lt. General Brent Scowcroft, Deputy Assistant
to the President for National Security Affairs

DATE AND TIME:. Thursday, June 26, 1975

- PLACE: The Oval Office
The White House

President: The only problem with my press conference was Mel Laird.

Kissinger: That raises a problem. We have absolutely no discipline in
the government. -Lynn says he has the same problem in the domestic area.
Schlesinger is now on a SALT violation kick again. Now he is talking about
massive Soviet missile deployments. We started MIRV deployments five
years ago. Mel's article [in Reader's Digest] was mischievous. He says
the Communists are coming after us in Portugal,

President: It isn't their fault. We are hamstrung.

Kissinger: Wé are building up problems for a SALT agreement. They
are unyielding on cruise missile and Backfire.

President: Is Defense now saying not to count cruise missiles?

Kissinger: Up to 3000 kilometers, yes. That would be a farce -- it would
just shift the strategic competition from ballistic to cruise Missiles. We
have offered a ban on ship-launched cruise missiles and not air-launched
ones,

[He hands the President a list, which he reads, J

President: If they are going to be intransigent, we are going to have to
go public. We have no choice. .

Kissinger: Max Fisher came in and said they are trying to yield and just

trying to find a way. We can't wait, They have already screwed it up
doing it before CSCE, which we wanted
heads wereown, : =

  

Here is the letter -- we have revised it just a little.
[The President reads the letter. ]

President: Can Rabin say that he did respond to my telephone call?

Kissinger: We can take that out. He didn't change, but that looks
petulant, .

 

President: We could say "We have had no change in your Position,"

Kissinger: We don't need to do that. Itis a dig and would lead to a
Peripheral argument,

President: The rest looks fine,

7 —Kissinger: Shall we get Dinitz in there?

President: Sure,

Kissinger: Shall we have Javits in for five minutes?

President: How about Ribicoff? ,

Kissinger: If you want to lay it out.for him,

President: How about that letter on Soviet MFN?
[The President reads the draft letter, ]

Let's get it up there today,

in order, to do it while.the Soviets!
Kissinger: Volpe wants to begin discussions with the Communists in Italy,

oe

 

President: I don't understand that,

Kissinger: It is a case of localities: It will be hard not to include the
Communists in the government, but we don't want to play,

President: [ agree,

Kissinger: Your meeting on the Turkish embargo this morning -- your
talker has an option to put in a Greek aid sweetener,

[He reads the President the Brademas hintercept ith the Greek
Ambassador.) — .

President: With this group, should Itell them what I Propose and urge
them to proceed and ask them what they think?

, Kissinger: The waiver is something you are willing to do for them; it is
not for us.

: We are having another Church Problem, They are now asking for
everything related to the six asSassination areas -- it is all the NSC
Processes, :

President: We are not going to do it. Who is the problem? Hills?
=aesident:
Kissinger: No, Hills is fine. Colby is the insoluble problem.
