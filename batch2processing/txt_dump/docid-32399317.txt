VAIVADA then asked an intimate service friend df sufficient means, who
resides in PBPRIME, to act as his wife’s sponsor. The friend did so,
sending the required affidavits to the Habana Consulate. Inasmuch as
replies: to consular queries sent to Panama and Costa Rica had not been
received, and the switch in sponsors made by VAIVADA appears to have
caused the consular officer some concern about. the case, no action was
taken on the application by the time VATVADA was TDY’d to PBPRIME for
training and had sent his wife and-children to San Jose. This consular.
officer had a reputation for creating difficulties when none existed,
and it is to that extent unfortunate that VAIVADA’s case was assigned .
to him; he has since, however, retired and wuld have no part in this
case in the future. Mrs. VAIVADA then re-applied for the visa in San
Jose on April 1957, as outlined above, Sime VAIVADA is again planning
to send his family to San Jose while he is carrying out his mission in
‘Oriente Province beginning in March 1958, it is probable that Mrs.
VAIVADA will re-open.her..application in. San. Jose. . . .

“2. In a conversation with the writer on 23 January 1958 Mr. and Mrs. .

Arthur G, VAIVADA volunteered information that may be of interest to Head-
-quarters in.regard to paragraph 3.of. reference. (a). , .

- 2, When VAIVADA. said:that.he hoped his’ wife’s:immigration:visa’.... . oa |

 

had accused her of being a Nazi sympathizer. When World War II terminated,

and she prepared to quit her employment in the Post Exchange, she asked for

evidence that she had been a satisfactory employee. It was at this point -

that she had difficulty in obtaining a statement to that effect from her : aa

supervisor, owing to his belief that she was pro-Nazi. : .
3. When the writer showed his surprise, Mrs. VAIVADA continued the :
explanation by saying that a color line existed in Panama at that time. She 4
mentioned a ferry-boat connecting tht Republic of Panama with the Canal Zone \
i

which she and one of her two sisters (who also worked in the Post Exchange)

had used daily.to go to and from work. ..White persons used the upper. deck,

"colored" persons the lower deck. She further mentioned that the Post

Exchange maintained two payrolls, a "Silver Roll" for "colored" employees

and a "Gold Roll" for "whites". Since she is dark skinned, her supervisor

placed her on the "Silver Roll" and she had also to use the lower deck on : 4
the ferry-boat. “Her sister, being blond-haired and white skinned, was placed

on the "Gold Roll", That is, her two sisters having white: skin, blond hair t
and blue eyes, were classed as whites while she was classed as "colored" : ‘
owing to her dark coloring. Despite explanations of her fanily. background
made to her supervisor by her sister and herself, the supervisor refused to oo 8
re-classify her. Angered at this distinction, Mrs. VAIVADA, who said she was “ 4
something of a leader among the female employees at the Post Exchange, began

a campaign among then to get their organized support of her cause, She did

not mention details nor the success of this campaign, but said that it
resulted in bringing down upon her head. the wrath of her supervisor, who

made an official investigation of her and had her reported as a ‘dangerous
labor agitator having pro-Nazi sympathies".

lh. At this point VAIVADA related that he was then courting Irs.
VAIVADA and had had difficulty with his commanding officer as a result.
He said that one day, in an effort to clear Mrs. VAIVADA with her
supervisor, he telephoned to the latter. As soon as he mentioned Mrs.
VAIVADA’s name the officer became agitated, warned VAIVADA to be wary of
Mrs. VAIVADA, end repeated to him the story of her pro-Nazi sympathies
and agitation activities. VAIVADA said he. hung up and did not press
the matter. He said that he had ‘mown his future wife long enough by
then to be personally satisfied that the allegations against her were
false.

Se Finally, in -the- conversation: Mrs.. VAIVADA ‘said that her: father.-:
and his parents were of German ethnic origin, and she demonstrated a
knowledge of the German language. ;

6, The writer met and began working with VAIVADA in August 19555
and during this entire time the latter has never mentioned a former marriage
of his wife. Having frequently seen and conversed as well with Mrs. VATVADA
since that date, it is difficult for the writer to picture her as having
been a ballet dancer. She is under five feet in stature, is very plump,
with thick lips. and distinctly yellow-browm skin. Mrs. VAIVADA impresses
the writer as having considerable shrewdness and, in his view, could conceal
facts. if she, believed... usband,..to_whom.she...is completely
‘Yoyal. It was evident from the above conversation that Mrs. VAIVADA believes
fier “I9)3 Post Exchange difficulties have adversely affected her immigration
visa application. That she volunteered the information appears to be a
point in her favor, howevere

  

7. The matter of Mrs. VAIVADA’s visa application deserves mention
now inasmuch.as it is clearly. the VAIVADA’s intention to re-open the
application in June 1958, or at such time as VAIVADA’s transfer from Cuba
becomes effective. Tne writer cannot judge whether the events of 193
have or have not prejudiced her application; perhaps Station San Jose cm
investigate to determine this. For Headquarters” and Station San Jose’s
information, the visa aoplication was initially made by VAIVADA himself in
Habana in February 1957. At that time VATVADA named himself as his wife’s
sponsor, but the consular officer hadling the case turned the application
down owing to insufficient financial means on VAIVADA’s part because.
VAIVADA was, for security reasons, unable to show his regular KUBARK
employment and the more than adequate financial status he derives from ite
