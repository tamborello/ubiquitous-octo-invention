“Dear Jay:

 

_ : Your letter makes me feel that I did not .

“\ yvead your manuscript with as much insight or sensitivity |
- ‘as I should have brought to it. The fault may be in

part in the manuscript itself, but I feel that I

: cannot be altogether absolved from blame for not under-
., Standing the intent, the inner drive of the thing, ot
“even if this purpose is not fully realized. I feel it

» is not realized, yet I believe it is there, wrapped
“though it may be in detail..

 

: The concept of broadening the study of filn,
to use it (as yous say) as a lens for the study of a i
country's history and character, is necessary and I '
_am sure you are well equipped for the task. (Yhe horrib-
"ly, low level of film history. or criticism in the U. S.,
.: vesting. as it-does on a phoney aesthetic, has been
-- evident to me (perhaps with some subjective over-
emphasis) ip the treatment ‘of my FILM: THE CREATIVE
‘, PROCESS-- not merely that so many critics attacked ot
.o it, but-that they attacked it without the: faintest
| guspicion of what it is about.

 

I feel that your letter states some of the
problems, but also states certain limitations (as I
see it) in your approach. Let me make three points;
. first, you speak of"aesthetics" and "sociology:". |
_You say, "sociology is probably dominant", I feel
there is a danger in this, because it suggests a sep-.
aration of the two approaches, and I feel that we
“must achieve an integral approach. Marxist thought has
. suffered badly in the cultural field from the separa- '
tion, and a rather stuffy certainty that sociology is. i
‘ptimary: art in the real sense, the creative realization ;
of human;potentialities, is primary, and I think this
view of art (along with its misuse and degradation in
; societies which are not creative) is the basis for a
.-richer approach, | oe , : ‘
: Second point: the theme of "treatment of
womén," which you mention could, I think, be infinitely |
“ more revealing, and more realized in terms of filn-- mi
: and through the lens of film, the whole social situation.
a ‘ Third point :!Chronology'You are right that |
- . it must have more freedom-~ forward and backward, but ,

 

 

 

 

 

 

.-g@6mmhow the frame of reference, the reality of time, a.
‘< must determine the movement back and forward. The i
“ question of time is-, I think, a central factor in . i

cinema art-- and-it must be so in your nook. | i

‘All these problems face me in somewhat”
