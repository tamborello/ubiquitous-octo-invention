VANSCOY and are kept on a chain; however, the chain is short

door without the dogs getting to him if he is careful. There
are no windows in the club and those inside have no view out
except through the front door, It has a front and side door,
both re-enforced with 1/4" steel plate. Two phones are in
the club, GR 8-1577 and GR 8-0102. Both VANSCOY and BARNES
