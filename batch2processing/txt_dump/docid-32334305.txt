ton Parish, La. WARNER stated that SAXON FARMER had been :
elected as the Grand Dragon and that the FBI was in the
area of the meeting place. WARNER stated that he receives
his orders from "higher up” but did not identify who these
“higher ups" were. WARNER stated that he was going to ,

Bogalusa newspaper,

WARNER stated that prior to tirowing a dead animal
on the lawn of LOW MAJORS after the meeting on 1/12/65,
he had consulted with an attorney who told him that
if he and the others were caught, all they covld be charged
with was littering which would result in a $10 fine.
Subsequently WARNER stated he received the above adviite
from ROBERT T,. RESTER, the City Attormey and the he was
seriously thinking of asking RESTER, H, A, GOINGS, SR.,

heard to make the statement that a Ladies’ Auxiliary
of the OKKKK in Bogalusa has been established and
consists of 20 women who had been meeting at her residence
on Friday evenings, Mrs. WARNER expressed an interest
in the use of the DAV Hall because she said that

her residence was too gmall to acconedate this number

Bogalusa Auxiliary Police force will be in charge of
intelligence for the Unit.
