PETE LICAVOLI oS
WHITEY BESASE . 2S

Informant advised. on 5/2/63, that he has been
well acquainted with the. operatien. of YONNIE LICAVOLI , who
is presently.in the State Prison in Columbus, Ohio, and with
PETE. LICAVOLI ,' his brother, who lives in‘ Detroit. Inf ermant
stated that in @der to understand: the operations of the
LICAVOLIs in Ohio, one has to remember that when they left.
Detroit in the early ‘1930's, they. went ‘to Ohio, ‘knowing
they were going to have to take over by: force and kill
everyone who got in ther WAY. Informant stated éver “since Oe
they went into Toledo and thén teéek over Northern Ohic,
they have not telerated any interferencé’ or competition.
He advised that as a result of this, they control or have :
contacts with every police department in the major cities
and at the present time if a person wants to’ be in the.
rackets, you are their partner: er you. don*t ‘Operate. cad

. Informant continued that in. Ohio there is
.One numbers house. He stated in Detroit the¥é are several
numbers houses and at the’ present. time the Negrees control
about 60% of the business, Several years: ago, the Italians
in Detroit debated whether or not it would be worthwhile :
killing. eff the leaders of the Negro numbers operations,

This was veteed by the old Italians because they realize

that. while they could kill off the Negro leaders, the

Negoes would in turn kill off several of thé Italians.

The older Italians decided that the person who might be -
killed weuld be them, so it was decided that the extra: *
money that would be made would iiet be worth the éffort, :
Informant stated in Ohio this has not been’ true and !
killings mean little to the LICAVOLI. ‘group.

 

: - Informant stated that. if one would analyze
er follow the. actions of the Italians who came. with. YONNIE
LICAVOLI..to Ohie-in the early 1930's, one: ‘would find that”
each of these . is ina controlling position in a. major city
in Northern ‘Ohio. : ;
