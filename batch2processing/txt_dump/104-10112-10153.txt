Acting Chief of Station, Habana
Operational
Arthur G. VAIVADA

Reference: HKH-W~2380, dated 16 October 1957

1. The Subject has no objection to submitting to an LOFLUTITER test
at the convenience of Headquarters. This could be easily arranged here
in the event an LCFLUTTER team is passing, or could pass, through Habana;
on the other hand, VAIVADA could just as easily go to any designated place
in Florida in order to take this test. It is understood that LCFLUITER
teams from time to time visit that state.

2. The Station will take such measures as are feasible to cover the
activities of Subject and his wife while. in Habana.

3. While the matter was not referred to in the reference, Subject's
projected one-year tour of duty will end in June, 1958, at which time it
is VAIVADA's desire to leave Cuba for a reassignment in another area in
his present line of operational work and under simila: y
conditions. A detailed dispatch on this subject will shortly be trans-
mitted to Headquarters; it is referred to here so that the Headquarters desk
may be alerted to the need for considering what assignments would be
open to VAIVADA during the Spring or Summer of 1958.
