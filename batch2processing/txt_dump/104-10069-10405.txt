the requests contained in Reference A; but ae stated by Headquarters,
some of the information, particularly that dealing with the inter-
national aspects of the "Comite" and the "society of journalists," is
gonewhat sensitive and, therefore, will take time for L 8B to
elicit from Luis SUAREZ Lopez. at
