FUTURE PLANS

19. Future plans for operational exploitation of AMLEO-3
continue to remain the same as outlined in detail in reference D.
The operational use of AMLEO-3 in defection/recraitment
operations will not be permitted until his wife and children are
successfully put into asylum in one of the Latin American Embassies -
in Havana,

        
     
       
    

20.. WAVE Station will continue to work on AMLEO=3 developmental
cases concentrating on MHAPRON leads, and attempt to build two-
way communications channels into such leads. AMLEO-6 is still
considered to be the. best qualified lead by AMLEO-3 to act as
principal agent and recruiter of other disaffected military
personnel in Cuba. Details on these developmental operations
will be reported via separate dispatch.

code phrases for individuals) indicating that Identity B

has continued to be very helpful to her by supplying

her with blackmarket food, loaning her her automobile, and other-
wise assisting her with her problems.. Idantity B may be :
carrying out such actions on a genuine friendship basis,

‘(she hag even been denounced by the neighborhood defense
committee "as assisting gusanos") or she may be buying insurance
for the future, The possibility also exists that she is remaining
a confidant of Mrs. AMLEO-3 on orders of AMTHUG~1 and is
reporting on all developments to AMTHUG-1. In early September
1963 Raul PRIMELLES (201-327902) arrived at Identity B's
home for a visit while Mra. AMLEO-3 was present. Mx and Mrs.
PRIMELLES ignored the presence of Mrs. A-3 and did not speak
to heréwhile greeting Identity B. Because of this Identity B
promptly turned her back on her visitors and did not answer
them, continuing her conversation with Mrs, AMLEQ-3. Mr. and
Mrs. PRIMELLES were thrown into some confusion by this reception

and departed from the area.

 
 
      
   
   
        
 
       
     
       
   
   
    
    

    

12. Mrs. AMLEO-3 has also mentioned that UNSNAFU-12
was most kind to her during her. recent home leave in Cuba,
and made it quite clear she was anxious to get in touch with
AMLEQ-3, During the latter part of August Mrs. A~3 again
mentioned to her husband that UNSNAFU-12 had written Identity
B from Faris stating she was surprised at not having heard
from AMLEO-3.

ATTITUDE, MORALE, AND PERFORMANCE OF AMLEO-~3

    
       
     
   
   
  

   
  

  
   

13. During the reporting period AMLEO-3 has cousistently
been cooperative with his C/O and has maintained a good attitude
towards his work. During the latter part of Agust 1963 AMLEO-3-
began to lose his patience with the slow progress in getting
his wife into asylum, and began requesting permission to return

' to Cuba himself in order to exfiltrate his wife black. AMLEO-3
became quite demanding in this regard and clained that KUBARK's
time had run out, and since he had waited patiently for nine
months he now felt it was his turn to try his luck. AMLEO-~3
is extremely confident of his own ability in action situations
and operations and extensive argumentation was needed to
persuade him that such a course of action would be suicidal
for his wife and children and that his wisest course of action
would be to give us additional time to bring the asylum operation
to a successful conclusion, Because of AMLBO~3's faith. in
higher authority, COS JMWAVE, Andrew K. REUTEMAN visited AMLEO-~3
on 8 September 1963 for the purpose of convincing him that any
unilateral action on his part would only be counterproductive
and playing right into AMTHUG-1‘'s hands. KUBARK's limited
commitments to AMLEO-3 were also reviewed along with the history
of our actions to help his wife and children leave Cuba legally.
After some frank exchanges of facts AMLEO-3 was finally convinced
‘that the only productive course of action left to him was to
continue to sweat out the asylum proposition and hope for the
best. Absolutely no further commitments were made to AMLEO-3
during these discussions and alternate courses of action if

the asylum attempts fail were not discussed but instead left in

abeyance,

14. As previously mentioned in paragraph 13 of reference A,
AMLEO-3 went to ZRMETAL during the period 26-30 July 1963 for
the purpose of obtaining a French visa for his alias
documentation, AMLEO-3 successfully obtained the French visa
during this trip, and his alias passport now contains valid visas
for travel to Spain and France,

15. WAVE Station regrets that reference C has not been
answered to date. In reply we can only state that AMLEQO-3
was thoroughly briefed on the limitations of his alias documentation
when said documentation was issued to him. He was told that tho
credit card documents could never be used for identification or
credit purposes. He had algo been warned to avoid situations
where he would be asked for positive identification, such as
renting a car, and by attempting to procure a rental car in

-ZRMETAL he was acting contrary to instructions given to him
by his WAVE-C/0. On AHLEO-3"s return to WAVE he was castigated for
his actions, and again briefed on the limitations of his alias :
documentation, In order to strengthen his alias documentation

an I.D. card document identifying him as an employeeeof "Charles

8. Wilson Associates" hag been issued to him, as suggested by
(Chester D, DAINOLD tn conversations with AMLEO-3 in ZRMETAL.

In regard te points a and b in paragraph 2 of reference C,

the _KURIOT representative in WAVE Station states that. the Florida
drivers license issue o Joseph A. Reese Is a valid, backstopped
drivers license for actual use by the Subject and the address

a legitimate safehouse with backatopped rental cover, Subject's
cover story was that he recently moved to the Miami area from

New Orleans, Louisiana (which city the Subject lived m for

several years and has relatives residing there). The Subjct's |
documentation is therefore correct for his cover story, The
spelling of "instalment" on the National Credit Card waa correctly
cepied from the original document reproduced by KURIOT and we must ft
point out that "instalment" is not only correct according to the J
dictionaries but is the spelling:of the word which is now frequently

as "instalment" with one "I™.) It would be appreciated P
Headquarters would in the future coordinate with KURICT in

16, AMLBO-3 continues to receive a flat salary of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per month, and also is paid approximately
one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month for purchase of foodstuffs
since he is encouraged to eat his meals in the KUBARK
safehouse and stay out of public places. We have also continued
to pay the wife of AMLEO-5 the amount of one hundred and twenty five
dollars ($125.00) per month for subsistance for herself and her
two children to supplement the $120.00 per month she receives .
from the Cuban Refugee Center. The C/O has continued his efforts
to find part-time employment for Mrs. AMLEO-5 so that KUBARK
could be relieved of the necessity to support her, but to. date
we have been unsuccessful in our efforts primarily because Mrs.
AMLEQ-5 has never worked in her life and has no work skills
whatsoever. No other financial expenditures of note were made
during the period, and no financial assistance is presently
' contemplated for any other AMLEOQs. ;

    
       
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
         
   
    

INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

     

17. During the reporting period no positive intelligence
reports were disseminated by the AMLEO group since none of the
active agents are located in the target area, nor do they
circulate in Cuban exile circles,

    
     
 

18. We are continuing to utilize AMLEO-3 as a consultant
on the MHAPRON program, and to this end are planning to have
_ hin expand his reporting of personality information on selected
individuals and to utilize him to explain interconnections
between various individuals and groups as they take shape in
MHAPRON research, : :

OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

1. This report will cover the period SU July 1963 through
15 September 1963 and is a follow-up report to reference ‘1.

EFFORTS TO LEGALLY EXPILTRATE AMLEO'3 FAMILY FHM CUBA |

. 2. Since transmission of reference A to Headquarters several
developments occurred which effectively eliminated several alternate
solutions to the problem of the AMLEO-~3 family in Cuba. The
alternate solutions that were eliminated, as found in paragraph
3 of reference A, were (a) "Maintain Status Quo as a Family
‘attempting Leave Cuba via Offices of Swiss Embassy as Part of the
American Repatriation Program"; (b) "Have AMLEO-3 Family
Withdraw Papers From the Swiss Embassy and American Repatriation
Program and Attempt Leave Cuba as Normal Refugees via Mexico
Or Spain"; and (e) "Have the AMLEG@ Family Case Taken up With the
GOC Through the ‘Donovan’ Channel for Possible Legal Exfiltration".
_Elimination of the above alternates left only two solutions
that were at all feasible; (c) "Have the AMLEO-3 Family Take

._ Asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mexican Embassies in Havana",
or (d) "Have the AHLEO-3 Family Exfiltrated black in a Haritime

' Operation by either a KUBARK or Independent Maritime Team."
Because of the inherent risk involved in a black exfiltration,
it was decided that the AMLEO-S family should be put into
asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mexican embassies with all
possible speed.

3. To this end steps were initiated in on 24 July 1963
‘to put the AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 into asylum in the Mexican |
Embassy in Havana. The AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 were advised
via the AMWEE~-1 OWVL channel on 4 August 1963 to prepare
themselves for asylum and to await further orders via the same
channel, KUBARK Station in Mexico City, meanwhile, took urgent
action through its Mexican liaison channels to have the Mexican
Foreign Ministry obtain visas for the AMLEC-3 family and
AMLEOQ-2; and then send word to the Mexican Embassy in Havana,
Cuba that the AMLEO-3 family and AMLEQ-2 should be granted asylum
when they appeared at the Mexican Consulate under cover of
obtaining their visas. The visa portion of the operation was
satisfactorily completed and notification of same was sent into
. the Hexican Embassy in Havana; but word re asylum for the
AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 was not sent to the Mexican embassy
due to insecure commo channels and lack of trusted couriers, and
-to date no secure method has yet been found to notify the Mexican
Embassy in Havana that asylum should be granted to the AMLEOs,

      
     
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
     
       
     
   
   
   
 
  

4, As a’result of the above, word was sent to AMWEE-~1
via OWVL on-il September requesting he detemine whether or not
Identity A’ would be willing to act as intermediary to receive
the AMLEQ-3 family and AMLEO-2 into asylum at a specific tine
and date at the Mexican consulate. AMWEE-1 asked for
clarification on the manner of approaching Identity A on the case
on 13 September via pouch, and more detailed guidance on the
matter was sent to him via CWVL on 14 September. A final reply
re possibilities for action via this channel is expected from
AMWEE-1 momentarily. If the AMWEE-1 reply is favorable, then
he will be told to arrange the meeting at the Mexican consulate
between the AMLEOs and Identity A so that they can be taken inte
asylum by the Mexicans.

; 5. As noted in reference B, if the AMWEE-1 report is a
negative one, then consideration will be given to having the
ANLEOs take asylum in the Uruguayan Embassy in Havana, The
test case utilizing AMCANOE-3, mentioned in paragraph 5 A of
reference B, is te be attempted on or about 21 August 1963, and
4f this attempt at asylum is successful then arrangements will
be made to have the AMLECGS enter the Uruguayan Embassy in the
game manner,

7. 6. As noted in paragraph 1 of reference B, the wife
of AMLEO~3 finally made a direct contact with ANTHUG-1 on 7
September 1963, while he was at his Santa Maria beach house,
and appealed too him for permission to leave Cuba with her
| children and rejoin her husband AMLEO-3 in the United States,
On 14 September 1963 AMLEO~3 received a letter from his wife
giving more details on the above meeting. The wife of AMLEO-3
|! had been visiting the beach home of a family friend, situated
| next to that of AMTHUG-1 on Santa Maria beach, gn a daily basis-
hoping to see AMTHUG-1. Finally, on 7 September 1963, she saw
him swimming alone in the ocean and promptly went into the water,
| introduced herself , and requested prmission to talk to hin. .
| AMTHUG-1 granted this permission, and during their conversation
| AMTHUG-1 made it clear he would. not grant Mrs. AMLEO-3 permission
to depart Cuba at this time, stating that the tine was not
| propitious due to the attacks and raids being carried out
| against Cuba, and that Mrs. AMLEO-3 would just have to wait.
Mrs. AMLEOQ-3 then told him she did not see why he was holding her
and her children respoasible for what her husband did; that she
feared her husband might forget her and their children completely J

4f the separation continued, and that if AMLEO-3 was left much

) longer alone he would find a woman to replace her. AMTHUG-1

| replied by asking her "Do you consider yourself a burden to your
) husband?" The wife replied "It is possible", and ANTHUG-1 then a

; 7. Later during the conversation AMTHUG-1 asked

Mra. AMLEO-3 if her husband still had the presentation Soviet

pistol that he .had given him in 1961, and Mrs. AMLEO-3

‘dnformed hin that her husband had taken it with him when he
defected and asked AWTHUG-1 if he wanted it returned: to bin.

AMTHUG-1 did not reply to the question. Later on, while

discussing her conversation with AMTHUG-1 with Identity B,

Identity B suggested to Mrs. AMLEO-3 that she request AMLEO-3

to send the pistol pack to ANTHUG-1 via Ambassador LECHUGA

at the United Rations, NYC. Identity B added that the return -

of the pistol might help matters since the loss of the pistol had

- peen one of the things that bothered ANTHUG-1 most when

AMLEO-3 defected. (i.e. AMLEO-3 has noted that these special

- presentation Soviet pistols were given by ANTHUG-1 to probably

less than ten people in Cuba, and their. presentation had a very

special yeaning for ANTHUG-1 since the recipients were supposed

to be his very personal and close friends. AMLEQ-3 claims

that not even ANLOUT-1 had received one of these special

presentation pistols from AMTHUG-1.) Consideration is being

given to AMTHUG-1's request, 4£ it would assist irs. AMLEO=3

in her efforts to leave Cuba, but for the time being the pistol

will be held by KUBARK. : .

3, AMTHUG-1 also told Mrs. AMLEO-3 that her husband had

gteler 8 light plane when he fled and implied (although she

does not sO state directly) that he would Like to see it

returned. The balance of Mrs. AMLEO-3's letter concerned her

desire to leave Cuba, mentioned the pecessity for @inness by both

_ she and her husband with no rash actions, and. without giving
any additional facts stated that ber conversation with ANTHUG-1

had been a long one but that she could not get him to make

any promises re her departure.

 

DEVELOPMENT OF OPERATIONAL LEADS TO DISKFFECTED CUBANS

9, During the operational period one of AMLEO-3's
operational leads, whom he had written 2 report on for the
AMTRUNK PM operation:, was recruited via the recently successful
AMTRUNE infiltration operation and given the erypt of AMTRUNK-10.
ANL.EO-3 also screened additional ANTRUNK leads and KUTUBE —
military leads during the period and was able to submit .
reports on some four individuals for these operations. All. such
leads were fed to hin mixed in with many other Cuban names.
| AMLEO~3 is presently preparing reports on PHS target studies
Major Felipe GUERRA Matos and Major Jorgé SEGUERA, Cuban
Ambaseador to Algeria. . :

10, AMLEC-3 also assisted in the handling of AMLEO-5's
wife during the period when she established direct telephonic
communication with her husband in Cuba, and tried to convince
/ fim that she wanted to return to Cuba witb her children,

only knew what day the calls would be coming in and never the :
hour. He also assisted Mrs. AMLEO-5 in recording the last telephc:
conversation she had with her husband. In this game operation

held with the mother of AMLEO-5 while she was in the United
States, although he was never allowed to establish direct \
contact with the mother. We had hoped that the mother of ‘
AMLEO-5 would attempt to establish contact onher own with :
-AMLEO~3, but to WAVE Station knowledge ghe never attempted to do :
so. If she had, we would have allowed AMLEQ-3 to respond to her ,
contact efforts (maintaining his cover as peing disassociated
