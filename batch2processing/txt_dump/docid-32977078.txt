Main Pointe to Consider
26 October 1962

lL. What is the Pelicy Objective? We aged a sharp focus on :
| exactly what we hopa te get from Mongoces new, This will determine
hew best te employ these unique U.S. resources -- either to support
U.S. military operations or directly to commit against the Communiot —
regime immediately. Le

ie the ond ebjective the removal of the Castre/Communist
regime or to bring it to ite knee 7 Should Mengeose help generate . -
_a popular revolt with the probable seed for overt U.S. military belp
as the regime moves in to crush it? Or, is the aim that of maximum
harassment, to make Cuba a maximum burdes for the Bloc? :

Undeubtedly, most peeple in the world now expect ua to move
towards remeving the Castre/Communist regime. Certalaly the
Cubans in exile and inside Cubs, who are the malin covert aesete ef

CIA, new expect this policy goal ae the price of risking their lives.
