one Bill JCHNSON) that he {STURGIS) had killed Fresident John F. Kennedy.

“THOMAS J, HOLT ‘appeared at the office of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), 3801 Biscayne Boulevard,

Miami, Florida, where he was interviewed by Special Agents PETER B.

SCHOPPERLE and DON J. DUMFORD, FBI. Prior to the interview,

Special Agent (SA) SCHOPPERLE had explained to Mr. HOLT that the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was desirous of knowing

any information concerning remarks made by one FRANK STURGIS in

his presence concerning the assassination of President JOHN F.

KENNEDY at Dallas, Texas.

HOLT advised that he is not that well acquainted with
FRANK STURGIS, but that he met him approximately one year ago
at a party given at Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He stated that
he was introduced to STURGIS by a friend of his, BILLY JOHNSON.
HOLT advised that at this party STURGIS had told him that he
had been a hit man for FIDEL CASTRO, and that both CASTRO and
he (STURGIS) had both worked for the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA). ws

At this point in the interview, HOLT stated that —
ROCKEFELLER, meaning NELSON ROCKEFELLER, had been in charge of
the Warren Commission, and that it had been a cover up as far
as the assassination of KENNEDY was concerned. HOLT next stated
that the "hit" was done in Texas to make it look like JOHNSON
(President LYNDON JOHNSON) was at fault.

HOLT stated that he believed BILLY JOHNSON may have
told STURGIS to say the above things, just to impress HOLT.

HOLT next stated that while at this party, STURGIS
had named many people whom he stated were “big", and that he
knew these people. HOLT stated that he thinks STURGIS may _
have killed KENNEDY because STURGIS had said that he could
"shoot a person's brains out at 1,000 yards with a simple
rifle and imagine what I ‘could do with a Scope.” HOLT next
stated that if STURGIS had made these comments to him concerning
the assassination of KENNEDY he was sure that he had probably
told them to other people. HOLT stated that STURGIS was a man
approximately 50 years old. HOLT next stated that he advised
BILL JOHNSON had worked as an informant for the FBI, CIA and

By letter dated October 20, 1978, the United States
Secret Service, Miami, Florida, furnished to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), Miami, a copy of a letter sent to
that agency by the United States Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion (DEA), Miami, Florida, dated October 13, 1978. The DEA
letter advised that an infoxmant for DEA had indicated that
he was acquainted with Frank Sturgis of Watergate Notoriety,
and during a conversation Sturgis told the informant that he
had killed President John F. Kennedy. ‘This remark was supposed
to have been made in the presence of an individual by the
name of Bill Johnsen. DEA advised that this informant could
be made available for interview.

On November 7, 1978, Pater F. Gruden, Inspector in
Charge, DEA, Miami, Florida, advised that the informant in
this matter was Thomas Joseph Holt.. Gruden stated that Holt
was of questionable reliability, irrational, unpredictable,
_and described him further as a murderer and perjurer. He
advised that the only reason Holt was an informant for DEA
at this time was that Holt had furnished information of internal
nature, Gruden advised that David R. Wiser, Inspector, DEA,
Miami, could furnish more details concerning Hoit.

On November 8, 1978, David R. Wiser advised that

Holt had come to DEA and had made allegations of wrongdoings
against a DEA Agent. Wiser advised that to date the internal

. investigation in this DEA matter has not uncovered any evidence
to indicate any truth to the allegations of Holt. He advised
that the evidence to date indicates to the contrary.
Wiser advised that Holt had stated that during the late
summer 1978, he (Holt) was on Biscayne Boulevard in the downtown
Miami area, when he came upon Frank Sturgis, who was accompanied ~
by one Bill Johnson. Wiser advised that Holt stated that during

this encounter, Sturgis stated that he had killed John F.
Kennedy. Wiser stated that he asked Holt "Why would Sturgis
impart this interesting bit of news to Holt who was a

known government witness and publicized DEA informant frem
the past?” And Helt replied that it was " one hit man to
another". Wiser advised that Holt had indicated an intention
to go to the news media regarding his allegations against the
DEA, Wiser further stated that he thought it likely that
Holt would also make mention of the Sturgis comment, in that
he had reported this te DEA, and that they had done nothing
about it. Wiser advised for this very reagon_he wrote a memo
concerning what Holt had reported, and for this reason it was
furnished to the Secret Service.

Wiser made available a copy of this memo dated
October 4, 1978, which is attached.

Wiser further stated that in a case in which Holt was
a witness for the prosecution Holt had allegedly called a
defendant during a trial and told him he was going te “get him’.
whe defendant in this matter, at the time of the call, had a
recording of his telephone call made which was played for the
presiding judge. Holt denied making the call to. the defendant, -
and the judge ruled that Helt's testimony could not be permit-
ted.

On November 9, 1978, Wiser had advised that Billi
Johnson was William J. Johson, date of birth March 11, 1931,
FBI number 133677c, last known address 1890 N.B. 118th Road,
Miami, Florida. ,
