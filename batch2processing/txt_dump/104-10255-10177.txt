1. hile it ig possible for Besdquarters te obtain 2
fally backstopped addres in SR¥ETAL for AmuG/1 alias .
doctmentation, it is believed that auch an sddrees ia JMBAVE
would be more advantsgeous for the following reasons:

A. It hes been the experience in similar cases
that certsin consulates will NOT tasue vises to their
countries to persons epplying for them im one city and
helding gagsperts and 1-94 forue showing permanent or even
temporary addresses in another city.

3. Tho fect that subject resides in the WAVE area
ghould poge no particular problem in his being
tackstopped im alias in the same eity. For example,
SMM0G/1L resided in true neme in the ZRNETAL area and
at the game time was beackstopped in aliss in the same
area.

3. Please advise.
