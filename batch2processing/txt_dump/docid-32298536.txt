i treatment in Cuba, but Dr. GABRIEL CASUSO was of the opinion

FRANCISCO as being harmless, but a chronic liar, who lives

i entirely in a world of fantasy, Dr, CASUSO noted that

t FRANCISCO, after coming to the United States after the Bay

of Pigs Invasion, had been'sent to the Devereaux School in

i Texas for treatment of his mental condition. He remained
there for a year or so and was released after being Supposedly
cured of his emotional problems, Dr. GABRIEL CASUSO was
