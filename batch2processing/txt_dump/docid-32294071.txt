of $199.50 had been made at another branch office in NYC

but had not been credited to the subject's account. Asa
result, the check made out in May, 1961, for rent for the
apartment at 110 Christopher St., NYC, was not honored
inasmuch as there were insufficient funds to cover this’
rent. Mr. STRINING said that he called a telephone number
in NYC, the exact number he is unable to recall at the present
time, in connection with this matter. Mr. STRINING said he
spoke to an unknown: female who. answered his phone call, and
this unknown female advised him that "RICHARD FRANK and his
wife are in Red China, don't you knowrithat?" Mr. STRINING
was unable to recall this number but will endeavor to locate
the original deposit of $199.50 to determine if there is any
clue there as to the phone number he called.

An FD-122 noting the subject's residence and employment
status is being prepared and will be forwarded separately.
