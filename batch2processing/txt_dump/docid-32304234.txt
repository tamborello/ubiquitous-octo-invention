NY 105-110005

; The call made on 7/12/69 (Saturday-to NOSS).
“was a collect call and. consequently rot direct dial and
was approximately seven minutes in length. {)

It is noted that another phone call was also
made on 7/12/70 to Greenwich, Connecticut. Investigation has
established that this call was made to a phone subscribed
to. by JOSEPH HYMAN FILNAR (Bufile 100-2341)-ami to DORIS
JONES FILNAR -(Bufile 100-410630)" The FILNARs are former
subjects of the NYO with long time CP affiliations. As

matter of interest, all the phone numbers fumished b: ny (70} YS)
ntly

and set forth in NY let of 6/4/70, have all been subseque:
shown to unquestionably have been made by the subject. Po
‘S
) 7400 $s contacted on 10/13/70, relative to
the above tters“and was unable to furnish any observations

of value other than the fact that{LESIOVSKI]is seemingly per- cxcu)

sonally acquainted with every section of the US through
travel. The NYO has no observations on the significance of
the age difference of the subjects or the sequence of the
calls. \

It is noted that HILL is formerly from Houston,
Texas, and in any anticipated contact with him, this back-
ground might be utilized as an entre pretext. The pretext
entre of NOSS is considerably easier because of his back-
ground of employment by the University of California. -
It is felt that this facet of NOSS' background should be
further explored. Both pretexts could be of the nature of
a survey of leading members of the community to determine

if they have been experiencing anyf{contacts with persons § .
(representing business] or(cultural interests\ of (eve Soviet Ch ul
Union] or Satellite tries.) The NYO does not feel that (3 ul

» sinterviews of the subject will endanger the security of

as 7H0Q)S{pecause! of the wnusual nature of the original
inrormatfon and how it was furnished and subsequently
‘determined.
