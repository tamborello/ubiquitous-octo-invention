plot against the President of Panama as serious. He
had felt, however, that he should report this matter
to his acquaintance, Dr. GARCIA NAVARRO, Panamanian
Consul. im Fort Lauderdale. Accordingly, he had made. the
above information available to Dr. GARCIA NAVARRO, who

- subsequently reported it to his government. General

“ BENITEZ indicated im his opinion, Dr. GARCIA NAVARRO may have
over-emphasized the significance of this alleged plot ‘in
order to enhance his (Dr. NAVARRO 8) position with the
Panamanian Government .

General BENITEZ said probably the primary purpose:
of JIMENEZ’ viéit to Miami during the summer had been :
to visit his Cuban girl friend, who subsequently. has . ,
moved to Puerto Rico.

General BENITEZ stated since this ail happened,
an. official of the Panamanian Goversment had come to Miami .
.to investigate this matter, and had interviewed several .
. of the participants in the alleged. plot, including’
_.SERGIO. CASTRO. It was determined at that time that wo
mo further action had. been taken in. this > plot, and that it ved
was considered & closed matter. . : ;

 

General BENITEZ advised that he has recently ik
learned, from a friend of his,-one JOSE LUI LFARO, ve
a former police official in Panama, thet. JUAN JIMENEZ
recently recefved an appointment with the Panamanian
Gowernment. JIMENEZ is reportedly now assigned in a
diplomatic capacity for the Panamanian Government. and is
reportedly in Washington, D. C. Accordingly, JIMENEZ is

-no longer unhappy with the Panamanian Government.”

‘Dr. GARGIA NAVARRO stated in his opinion,
General BENITEZ was attempting to ingratiate himself with

General BENITEZ had subsequently advised Dr.
“GARCIA NAVARRO that JIMENEZ had: pedd some $500.00 to SERGIO -
" CASTRO in ‘connection with the alleged plot, but that. CASTRO.
‘and: RODRIGUEZ DIAZ had taken no action to further the” ‘plot;
‘but were ‘only standing by awaiting further developments.
No further developments apparently materialized. Yur

Dr. GARCIA NAVARRO advised he had not taken
the above allegations of a plet by JIMENEZ, as reported
. by, General BENITEZ, at all seriously, in view of General
_ BENITEZ’ reputation. Subsequently, however, at the time
of the uprising on the part of members of the National
. Guard in Panama, which appeared.to coincide with the threats -
made: by: JIMENEZ, Dr. GARGIA NAVARRO felt that there might
be some basis for eoneern, and accordingly had furnished “4
information concerning the alleged plot to United States 7 4
Government officials, as well as to Panamanian officials.
° Subsequently, an Inspector from the Panamanian National
Police had been sent to Miami to investigate this matter,
and, had interviewed BENITEZ in connection with the alleged
plot. Ruy

. Subsequent to that time, no further information
has been developed concerning the. alleged plot, either
through the Panamanian investigator or General BENITEZ,
and in Dr. GARCIA NAVARRO's opinion, the matter is
closed. (Gh)
