Lieutenant ROBERT GANECEK, United States Coast
Guard, Tampa, - Florida advised that when he: initially
i oon interviewed Captain 8. TANINO of the Japanese freighter
“Asaka Maru", it.was the belief of ‘the Captain that the
explosion aboard: his vessel was caused by a mine or
some external force which blew into the ship while moored
at the pier of Port Sutton, Tampa, Florida on the night
of May 30, 1968, :

 

“Commander GANECEE, informed that he had
difficulty in the course of his interview with the —
Captain .in view of the ‘language barrior and since the
Captain spoke very little English.

i)
“Commandér * ‘“GANECEK said it was his opinion . 4
initally that the bomb‘ caused ,the explosion placéd there 4
rh . .. ~- ++ from within the vessel as opposed from being placed into Bs
| . the rudder post area. from the outside. Hé said he J
i based this opinion initially on the fact that it had been
| determined that the 17 or 18 nuts Securing the hatch cover
in the rudder post area appeared to have been removed recently
as they wére loosened in the presence of two of his
officers, witb very little effort, He said normally
removal of this hatch ‘would require qpite a bit of exertion
and one would normally hase to have a hammer and. wrench
to. loosen the. nuts,

: . He. stated, however, that the possibility exists
~that the bomb could have been placéd through the aperture
. around the rudder post as the apérture area on Japanese
vessels around the rudder post is from anywhere from
three to four inches. “Commandér GENECEK said it was his
i : opinion that. Ban American vessels when the. rudder post
plating or ‘rudder post splash plating is secured around
the rudder post, thé apérture: around the rvuddér’ post is
merely, approximately one hal@ inch to one inch, and —
accordingly it would appear to be impossible for Someone
te place a bomb outside the vessel,
