Such secrecy may well be prompted
by ‘security considerations. Chi-

nese officials were apparently

seriously shaken by the abortive
plot to kill Liu Shao-chi in
Cambodia last spring. The Chi-
nese envoy in Cairo reportedly
told Nasir of concern for Chou's
safety and asked that travel
plans during the Chinese leader's
visit to the UAR not be made

EAST GERMAN REACTION TO RELAXATION OF BERLIN TRAVEL

Reaction of East Germans
to the agreement to let West
Berliners visit relatives in
East Berlin is hopeful but still
fairly cautious, judging by re-
ports from local party officials.

The party central head-
quarters, obviously concerned
that the agreement might have
domestic repercussions, ordered
district officials to submit
immediate reports and detailed
follow-ups on reactions to this
partial relaxation of travel
curbs imposed in connection
with the building of the Berlin
Wall. Most of the responses
state that the people are elated
but are publicly voicing hope
that they may be permitted to
visit their relatives in West
Berlin and West Germany. Many
East Germans express hope that
the present move will be followed
by other relaxations-~a reaction
probably quite unpalatable to
the regime.

party headquarters--is still
fairly cautious: One party .
member in Magdeburg said: "The
reason we don't let our citizens
go to West Germany is that we
are afraid they will defect."
But he was promptly silenced by
comrades who parroted the party
line on "the terror against our
GDR citizens in West Germany."

Public expression of dis-
satisfaction with harsh travel
and internal controls has been
recurrent in recent months,
reaching a peak prior to the
20 October parliamentary elec—
tions. :

The people's reaction to

! the pass agreement with West

Berlin points up one of the re-
gime's major problems: how to
project an image of itself as a
sovereign state and of East Ber-
lin as its capital without in-
creasing discontent among its
population, who still risk shoot-
ing if they attempt to escape

CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERS'

With two weeks of their pro-
jected two-month tour of Africa
completed, Chou En-lai and For-
eign Minister Chen Yi can claim
high marks for their efforts to
project an aura of Afro-Asian
amity and to identify Peiping
with African aspirations, There
is no evidence, however, that
they have scored any comparable
success in the political or eco-
nomic fields.

The joint communiqué issued
on 21 December at the conclusion
of the Chinese leaders' visit to
Cairo contains few surprises,
and reports from Algiers suggest
that discussions with Ben Bella
are following predictable lines.
Thus far the Chinese have at-
tempted to minimize differences,
play up past contacts, and press
such themes as militant struggle
against colonialism and "US im-
perialism,."

In both Algiers and Cairo,
Chou's hosts sought to demon-
strate their nonalignment by
actions designed to play down
the impact of the Chinese lead-
ers'arrival. Chou was greeted
in Cairo with a 2l-gun salute,
but Nasir was not on hand. In
Algeria, Ben Bella was on hand
to greet his guests, but the top-
level delegation he sent to the
Soviet Union just before Chou's
arrival is receiving more pub-
licity than the Chinese guests.

It has become increasingly

‘apparent that a major objective

of the trip has been to undercut
Soviet influence throughout the

continent. Criticism of the
USSR was reportedly a recurrent
theme in Chou's four lengthy
talks with Nasir. Nasir report-
edly said that Chou talked about
the USSR the way the Soviets
used to talk about the US. He
accused the Soviets of trying
to colonize China, of breaking
political and economic promises,
and of becoming tools of the

US, and he warned that any Afro-
Asian country which became de-
pendent on Moscow would suffer
the same fate as Peiping.

In Algeria, Chou sounded a
Similar note. He cited China's
early support for Algerian rev-
olutionaries--support which ac-
tually pre-dated that of the USSR.

Soviet unreliability. The Chi-
nese may be pressing the Algerians
to use some of the $50-million
credit offered in October. This
offer was made to counter a $100-
million Soviet credit offered
earlier the same month.

Sino-Soviet rivalry for
African support also flared at
the UN, where Peiping outmaneu-
vered Moscow on the question of
enlarging the representation in
principal UN organs to accommo-
date the African bloc. Soviet
delegate Fedorenko had attempted
to make it appear that the Chi-
nese were opposed to the African-
sponsored expansion plan because
they insisted that any change
in the UN be tied to Peiping's
own admission to the Security
Council. The USSR found itself

SOVIET TRADE ACTIVITY IN THE INDUSTRIAL WEST

Within a week after the
central committee approved
Khrushchev's plan for the chem-
ical industry, Soviet traders
apparently had their instruc-
tions and budget allocations

, and were renewing their activ-

ity in trade circles of the in-
dustrial West.

Contracts for fertilizer
installations, plastics and syn-
thetic plants, petrochemical
equipment, and mining machinery
are already in vario ages of

 
 

report they have under consider-
ation a proposal by a West Ger-
man consortium to supply the
USSR with $400 million worth of
petrochemical equipment. A
Soviet mission is negotiating
with the British Imperial Chem-
ical Industry (ICI), which here-
tofore has supplied the USSR
with technical know-how. ICI
reportedly has offered to de-
liver equipment and processes
for the production of fertiliz-
ers, herbicides, rubber chem-
icals, and plastics. Negotia-
tions also are under way for
large numbers of Japanese chemi-
eal fertilizer plants.

Another Western consortiun,
involving US equipment and proc-
esses, is discussing delivery
of a large oil refinery. In
addition, contracts for a wide
range of other machinery and
equipment will probably soon be
signed. These contracts appar-
ently had been postponed until
the new chemical equipment buy-

ing program was presented to
the plenum and allocations for
various trade corporations for
next year were approved,

The Soviet need for addi-

tional credit to finance planned
expanded purchases is crucial.
The USSR presumably can generate
sufficient funds to meet down
payments on sizable orders.
However, credit arrangements
must be set now to spread out
the heavy crush of payments
which otherwise would fall due
in 1965-66 when equipment con-
tracted for next year will be
delivered... Soviet ability to
increase hard-currency reserves
is not likely to improve in the
near future. Moscow's current
grain imports will reduce its
gold reserves by 25 percent.
If these continue beyond mid-
1964, the Soviet hard-currency
position will be under further
strain.

Despite the bleak foreign
exchange prospects for the USSR,
Soviet officials appear hopeful
that Western competition for
Soviet orders will be adequate
to foster Western governmental
and banking opinion favorable
to more and longer term credit.
Moscow may also hope that a
continuation of its relatively
restrained foreign policy will
be helpful in this context.
While viewing the USSR as an
acceptable commercial risk, the
banking community has hereto-
fore been unwilling to extend
credits beyond a five-year pe-
riod because of uncertainty
about future political develop-
ments. (SECRET)

The ten-year-old federation is being dissolved on

Pyongyang has more widely dispersed its supersonic

NORTH VIETNAM'S MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT
This military force, primarily a ground army with
no tactical air and little naval capability, is
nevertheless the most formidable in Southeast Asia.

Its most notable achievement is its highly special-_
