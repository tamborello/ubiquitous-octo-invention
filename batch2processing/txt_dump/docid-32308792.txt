SAMUEL _MANNARINO

he would not be permitted to operate slot machines in

Pennsy1lv. a, and accordingly he shipped some of the machines
o_ALBER and NORMAN ROTHMAN of the Tropicana Night
Club. in Havana in an attempt to salvage some of the money

he had invested in the machines. MANNARINO stated that in

addition to using the machines’: in the Tropicana Night Club, |

the Cuban Government had granted them permission to place the

machines in various spots throughout the islands of Cuba

in much the same fashion as slots were formerly used in the

United States. MANNARINO admitted that he would have

an interest in this slot machine operation.

 

SAMUEL MANNARINO, on March 14, 1958, advised that he had
recently returned fromza wisit to Camaguey, Cuba, and while
there picked up a great deal of knowledge about the Cuban
pineapple business and was seriously considering making an

investment in that field. MANNARINO pointed out that he also ees
visited Chicago, Illinois, very recently and added that for the
past several.months, he has been locating slot machines in the }
‘Tri-State area" for NORMAN ROTHMAN. MANNARINO said that a '
number of the machineshad already been shipped to ROTHMAN and |.
each transaction was arranged in such a manner that only the * .
name of the seller and ROTHMAN, the consignee, were.made a i 1.
matter of record. MANNARINO explained that- in each instance ;
the. Department of Justice.in Washington, D. C., and the U. S. i
Attorney in Chicago, Illinois, were notified of the shipments f
destined for ROTHMAN... In conclusion, MANNARINO emphasized :
that beyond locating the machines for ROTHMAN he-had absolutely
no personal interest in the machines whatsoever.

 

A source, whose reliability.is not known but who has been close
to the MANNARINO organization, advised on March 17, 1958, ;
that during the period 1951 - 1952, he had a twenty per cent i
interest in the Sans Souci where he was employed as General 4
Manager. Source explained that -while working at the Sans. x
Souci’ he answered solely to NORMAN ROTHMAN, who evidently had‘-
the largest share in the club since. he appeared to be . a
the person in authority. Source, when asked whether SAMUEL . |
or GABRIEL MANNARINO of New Kensington had an interest in the
Sans Souci, replied that he could not honestly my they did,
ung f unless ROTHMAN was fronting for them, Source explained that.
