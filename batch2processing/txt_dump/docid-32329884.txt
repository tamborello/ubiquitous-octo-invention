in strict confidence, that he had taken one person to
an abandoned well on some ranch land near Dallas, and
that the body of "TINCY” EGGLESTON was found in this
well and he was almost positive the person who killed
EGGLESTON was the same who killed NOBLE. He stated

of this information he obtained in this regard. He .
stated the person he thought had killed EGGLESTON and
