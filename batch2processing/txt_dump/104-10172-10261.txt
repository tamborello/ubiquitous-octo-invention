: 1. As of 1966, the KGB was attempting to locate former Soviet
intelligence officers who had defected, in order. to carry out
liquidation operations against them. Defectors so targeted were
Yuriy Ivanovich NOSEXKO, Anatoliy Mikhaylovich GOLITSYN, Nikolay
Yevgenyevich KHOKHLOV, and Petr Sergeyevich DERYABIN. In August
1966 the KGB Residency in Washington, D.C. acquired the addresses
of two Soviet defecters. According to source, the KGB was able ‘to
locate certain of these individuals by checking city telephone :
directories after cbtaining their assumed names from Congressional
records, where they eppeared in connection with the defectors! i -
acquisition of United States citizenship.

: 2. The KGB considered GOLITSYN an average officer. They
believed that he probably did not provide American intelligence'with
much information, as he was working in the Information Department
before his defection and therefore did not have access to operational
matters and also was assigned to the l4th (Counterintelligence)
Department for only a short study of operations. In this regard,
they considered NOSENKO's defection much more damaging to the x33.
Although GOLITSYN knew more about First Chief Directorate matters,

“NOSENKO was in a position to provide information on Second Chief

Directorate operations, as well as on the KGB as a whole.

3. Source commented that he suspected that both NOSEYKO and
GOLITSYN might have been approached by American intelligence Prior
to their actual defections, because GOLITSYN had had problems “with
his Chiefs" and NOSENKO drank. considerably and was involved with
girls. “ot
