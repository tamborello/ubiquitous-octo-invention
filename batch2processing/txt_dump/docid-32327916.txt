A photograph of the subject was directed to the
Bureau in New York letter to Bureau dated 10/7/63 under
caption "Criminal Intelligence Program - Hoodlum-Album".

During the period of this report contact was
maintained with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 90 Church
Street, NYC. It was learned that the subject, arrested
in 1961, is presently out on bond. Proceedings in this
matter have not commenced since that agency is attempting
to locate two fugitives named in the same indictment with
thesubject. It was generally understood that prosecution
in this matter involving GUIGA would commence in the
near future. Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
indicated that they had a "good" case on the subject and
his co-defendants and that their interest concerning the
subject while out on bail is continuing.

In view of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
pending prosecution of the subject as well as that
agency's continuing interest in his activities while on
bail, additional investigative effort might tend to jeopardize
their case. Consequently this matter is being placed in a
pending inactive status, in order that the prosecutive status
of this case may be followedm@md reported.
