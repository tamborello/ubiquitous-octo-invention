the lounge - a man who could meet executives on a little

The aforementioned formant advised that FEO hinted that

he could use a waitress of the calibre of FRANCES PRIAM,
Longtime head waitress at the Genovese Cocktail Lounge, -

412 Larimer Avenue, which he now operates as the Red

Eagle Club. He also stated that unescorted girls visiting
the lounge would be given drinks at no cost so that’ they could
stay on the premises and attract male patrons. He emphasized
that he had no wish to operate an escort service but that
high-class prostitutes. would certainly "add flavor" to the
establishment. The informant explained: that FELIX. "PHIL"
GENOVESE and MIKE GENOVESE have often stated that they. do

date a small blonde prostitute named BARBARA. GARRETT, and.
that when word got around that she was connected with the
GENOVESE brothers in some way her business was curtailed. by
cautious prospects. She said BARBARA will marry one AUGIE
(LNU), an Italian boy about twenty-five years of age shortly.
She does not think: AUGIE is in the rackets but has the -
potential, inasmuch as he is a good-looking Italian boy now
employed as a waiter at "Club 30," notorious gambling ©
establishment at Chester, W. Va. .She believes that he was
Screened for this position by "JO-JO" PECORA, GENOVESE!'s
organizational lieutenant. She said BARBARA is known to the
FBI, having been unfortunate enough to be pi¢ked-up in several
police raids, and that she once roomed with. NORMA GRILLO,
well-known Pittsburgh prostitute. She stated that BARBARA is
a small, twenty-four year old blonde who has not been.
prostituting for about three or four months and is determined
to stay out of the racket for the sake of her fiance; She
does not believe BARBARA would know very: much about anything
other than prostitution, despite her once ‘close assodation with

FEO GENOVESE because FEO was and is very close-mouttd

with the little information his brothers allow him to know.

interested in securing a date. for himself. .

She

lived at his farm in Gibsonia since early October, 1959.

She. believes his wife is having trouble. with her health,

but states that most of this trouble is in her mind and

that she worries about her husband a great deal. She
advised that the Red Eagle Club is quiet and still caters

to a neighborhood clientele preferring pizza and beer. She

most of Pittsburgh's racketeers who once made the Genovese
Cocktail Lounge their hangout prefer not to even be observed
in its vicinity. She stated that she had heard from "Young
Johnnie" LA ROCCA that. his older brother, "Big John," might
have to appear with MIKE GENOVESE at a trial in New York. City
but that "things will eventually all clear up."
