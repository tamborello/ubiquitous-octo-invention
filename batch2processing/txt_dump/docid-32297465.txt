SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III as follows: ,

On 11/20/63, SAM MANNARINO stated that the "contact"
has been made with "Judge Brown's wife." MANNARINO did
not indicate that the results of the contact had been
successful from his point of view and, in fact, appears to
be deeply, worried about the outcome of the trial. MANNARINO
changed one part of his story in that he now referred to
Judge BROWN's son going with the daughter of PAUL LONG,
rather than BROWN's daughter going with LONG's son, as had
been previously stated. . €¢
