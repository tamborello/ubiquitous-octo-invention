the SG's Arrival-Departure Records reflects that one SAM GIANCANA,
not further identified, arrived at the Beirut International Air-
port (BIA) in 3/26/74, from France. These records only reflected
that SAM GIANCANA was an American national. There is no record
that SAM GIANCANA departed Lebanon.

 

Captain IBRAHIM further advised that he will attempt
to locate the Arrival Card of SAM GIANCANA which would reflect
additional background information concerning him. He stated that
all Arrival. Cards are usually destroyed after three months but
there is a possibility, that due to the backlog of work at the
»~- SG,, these have not been destroyed yet. He stated that he would
' take administrative action against the SG officer who did not notic
the stop card of the sobsects ty ’
