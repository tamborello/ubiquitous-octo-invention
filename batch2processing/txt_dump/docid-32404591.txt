5. As noted in OPS' memorandum, OPS was only able to
locate files on Cherne, Leake and Garbler. However, after a
careful review, they determined that there is no information
contained in the files that links the individuals to or
pertains to JFK or to the JFK assassination. They also
found reference in Verna Dean Brown husband's file that she
was employed by the Department of State.

6. OTE was only able to locate a record on Paul
Garbler. However, the record does not pertain to the JFK
assassination.

7. This concludes DA action on this request. If you
have questions, please feel free to call me on 31201.
