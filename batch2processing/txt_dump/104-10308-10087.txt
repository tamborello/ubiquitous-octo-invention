61 Subject was involved in an action to kill Fidel CASTRO at the
26th of July ceremony at the Plaza Civic. The action was to kill
Fidel CASTRO by firing a bazooka shell at the speaker's platform.
This action failed because of a defective firing device in the
bazooka. The G-2 had had persons involved, working in resistance,
under surveillance for some time. She was connected with the MRR.
A G-2 interrogator said that the Cuban security forces knew every-
thing that was going on in the resistance movement. They permitted
these resistance crganiztions to organize and exist until it was decided
to roll up the group. She seemed to be connected with AMBRONC-5
(a CIA on-island asset) who was arrested and executed the latter part
of August 1962.
