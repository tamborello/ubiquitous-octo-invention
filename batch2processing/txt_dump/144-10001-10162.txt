MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD "a amills
V.

Subject: Response to Congressional Query :

1. On 9 November 1978, G8 began a search for material to answer an inquiry
by the House Assassinations Committee referred to us by NSA's Legislative Affairs
Office (LAO). An individual assigned to the USAFSS intercept station in Kirknewton,
Scotland (USA-55) in 1963 reportedly intercepted an[___|message containing! informa-
tion relative to an assassination plot against President John F. Kennedy. ;He claims
he intercepted this message, but was not allowed to disseminate the content. The
Committee is seeking to determine if this intercept actuaily occurred and has asked
NSA to check product and files for pertinent intercept and‘reporting from PSA-55 during
1963. ‘ :

2. Though it seems unlikely that such a message ever existed, the following
actions have been taken in response to the House Committee request: :

a. A records check was conducted in concert with m3. s—s—S—sSY

There was no material which was identified in the records index as: relevant ; however,
there were three boxes of material dated 1963 containing unidentified material. These
three boxes were opened and were found to contain the following: ‘.

1) Two boxes contained audio tapes with accompanying gisty and logs
from USASA intercept sites along the German/Czechoslovakia border (USM-42'.sites).
The intercept was identified as CL CO™~™CCC*C*C*diommun,catinss+) dated
1961. 44USC2107(5)(g)(2)(D)
b (iii)

2) The other box contained[
between the Soviet Union and Cuba. This material-was’ largely from the Naval Security
Group Activity at(____ SCC and was dated “in 1962. | ‘

      
  

b. A few personnel currently at NSA ttdd experience during’ 1963 with _
intercept policies and procedures at Kirknewton and ‘at NSA. Several of them were
questioned, and recalled that an[__ |mission did’ exist at Kirknewton in the 1963 time-
frame, that all traffic was forwarded to NSA, and that all reporting of L_|messages
was done at NSA. aan .

3. On 21 November LAO, asked that we also check thosé records available labeled
1964, because the 1963 datéd boxes contained material from 1962 rather than 1963.
Further, we were asked if product for the 1963 period was available, if USA-55 material
used in the product could be identified, and how much,of an effort would determining
this entail,.-We have checked the records for 1964 and find no boxes which we feel
should be’examined. The contents of all boxes are’clearly identified and none relate
to intercept, and there are none whose contents are not identified.

4. As noted earlier the product from[|___]intercept historically has been reported
by NSA. This product is available in T14, but there is no practical way to isolate that
which was derived from USA-55. It is possible to scan 1963 (QOC) product and it is the
T7142 estimate that this would require a minimum of four weeks to scan the some 9,900
such products on file for the period from January through November 1963. G8 did not
request_a_ search of these records, pending further word from LAO.
