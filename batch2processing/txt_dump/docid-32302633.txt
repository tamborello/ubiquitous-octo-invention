RE : JOHN“ROSELLI, aka.
AR ,

A neighborhood source has advised that ROSSELLI was
‘observed by her during the past week at his residence, Glen
Towers. Source said that she also observed the red-haired
girl (KATHY HORDEN) with ROSSELLI, and source believes that
this girl is living at ROSSELLI's apartment. Source also re-
called that on one occasion last week she saw ROSSELLI leave
the apartment in the company of IRVING LEFF and a man named
ROTH who frequently calls ROSSELLI. IRVING LEFF is a part
owner of the Hotel LastFrontier Corporation, and a friend
of ROSSELLI. ROTH may be JULES ROTH, head of the Hollywood
Cemetery Association, who had lunch with ROSSELLI on 4/8/64,
at. Perino's Restaurant.

It is recalled that on the evening of 5/6/64, :
ROSSELLI was observed in Los Angeles, riding in a new Pontiac
automobile, with a woman, and that the car bore Nevada license
plates CF 9679. On 5/11/64, the Las Vegas Office advised that
the records of the Nevada Highway Patrol reflect that this
license is listed to a 1964 Pontiac, two-door hardtop,
registered to K, HORDEN, 2908 Burton, Las Vegas, Nevada.

 

LV 129-PC furnished information on 5/12/64, that
ROSSELLI had actually departed from the Desert Inn Hotel on
Wednesday, 5/6/64, but that the registration card at the hotel

was not removed until 5/10/64. pe
