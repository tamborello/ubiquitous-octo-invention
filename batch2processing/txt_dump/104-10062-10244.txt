SUBJECT |: FOIA Appeal--Robert Sibley (F 76- -455) /
REFERENCES: A. Initial Request Letter,” 19 July 1976.

_| B. ‘Initial Response, 17 September 1976.
,, ~ Ge Appeal Letter, 21 September 1976.

; 1. Summary: The DDO concurs in the position of the
DDA/Office o inance/FOIO that Subject's FOIA appéal be
denied-in toto (Tab C). In view of the fact that the
Office of Finance is the office of record and repository
for the documents concerned, we recommend that the
response action for this appeal be transferred from the
DDO to the DDA.’

2. background:

- a. On 19 July 1976 Robert Sibley, a Washington,
pc journalist, requested "the complete travel

records of the Chief of the covert activities section
in the Domestic Operations Division of the CIA

from January 1, 1963 - December 31, 1963."" He
stated that according to his records E. Howard Hunt
occupied that position during the requested period.
If, however, his information was incorrect, he
requested the 1963 travel records of both the chief
of the section and E. Howard Hunt (Reference A).

b. IPS referred the request to the DDO for action.
It was determined during the initial review that
E. Howard Hunt was indeed an employee of the DDO/
Domestic Operations Division in 1963. It was further

Ba Recommendations:

“office of. record: for the documents concerned, we.
--recommend that ‘responsibility for the appeal

    

be denied inasmuch as they represent an .
accounting for expenditures on the certificate
of the Director under Section 8b of the CIA 7
Act of 1949, as amended, and therefore are .
specifically exempt from disclosure b statute--
exemption (b)(3) of FOIA. (See Tab cy. :
The Office of Finance conducted a classification aa
review of the documents in’February 1977 and © ‘<3

“downgraded them from Secret te Confidential.’

  
  

: Since the ‘DDA/Office of Finance. is the”

response be transferred to the- BDA. So ae :

: ‘b. “We concur with the Office of Finarce' s
classification review and with its citation of
exemption. (b)(3) for. denial in toto of the
requested documents. We recommend, however,
that exemptions (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b) (6). also
be claimed. Justification for these exemptions
is still valid notwithstanding Subject's
arguments to the contrary. Subject's point
concerning Hunt's privacy is well-taken and |
should not have been cited as a principal reason
for denial in our initial response letter of

17 September 1976. Exemption (b)(6), however,
was claimed at that time to also protect the
privacy of Hunt's operational contacts who were
listed on the vouchers. Both exemptions (b) (3)
and (b) (6) apply then and now to these individuals.

c. By noting in our initial response that
sanitized versions of the documents would be use-
less to the requester (our second principal reason
for denial), the implication was made that segregable
versions could be released, however meaningless.

This position was not upheld in our appeal review.
We concur with the Office of Finance's stand that
the requested records are in the class of documents
which are specifically exempt from disclosure by
statute and therefore should be denied in toto.
