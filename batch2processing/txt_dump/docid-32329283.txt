Mr, R. A, BURROW, Chief Special Agent, Southwestern
Bell Telephone Company, Dallas, Texas, (protect identity),
was contacted 11/15/63, by SA ROBERT M.. BARRETT.

On 10/31/63, DL-141-C furnished the following to
SA ROBERT P. GEMBERLING: +

 

 

Informant advised that AL MEADOWS stopped at Ennis,
Texas, to see informant on 10/30/63. MEADOWS stated he was
en route to Corsicana to collect some money, believed by
informant to be gambling debts.

MEADOWS in his conversation mentioned having been
indicted by the Federal Grand Jury. He told informant that
the indictment resulted from several events. He described one
of them as follows:

Some fellow, not identified by MEADOWS, brought
another fellow, also not identified by MEADOWS, to a crap game.
The fellow brought to the game was said to be okay by the person
bringing him and was quite a "big player". This man got ahead
in the. game by about $6,000.00 in a very short time and then
‘thereafter lost his entire winnings. As this "big player" got
behind $5,000.00, MEADOWS would make him give a check and after
the man was finished MEADOWS had several checks from this man
which the man told MEADOWS to hold and that he would be back
the following week to pick up the checks. The next week this
man returned and gave MEADOWS a cashier's check for $7,000.00
in exchange for the checks being held by MEADOWS. MEADOWS
told informant he thereafter cashed the cashier*s check and
split it three or four ways but did not identify with whom
the split was made. Informant stated MEADOWS mentioned that
another event resulting in his indictment was as follows:

Another man, not further identified by MEADOWS, had
given MEADOWS about $10,000 in checks for gambling and later
came back and gave MEADOWS two $5,000 checks in exchange for the
original checks. MEADOWS indicated that this man was in the
oil business and was going to Butte, . Montana, where he had a
partner, The two $5,000 checks given to MEADOWS turned out to
be bad and during the efforts to collect, this man tried to
get MEADOWS to invest in the oil business or some oil venture.
MEADOWS told informant he sent the two $5,000 checks back to
the man in Butte to invest in some oil stock.
