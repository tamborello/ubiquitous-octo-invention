"You know his name. A big shot. A big
name.’ He used to bring them girls and
everything. We all should do the same
thing. Because all these things are
lies. They are putting on a circus.
They are taking information without any
basis for it. That no good bum (this is
an apparent reference to JOSEPH VALACHI)
has named things and names of 35 years
ago. How can they accept this? That
cuckold, VALACHI§"

CAMMILLERI subsequently departed remarking that he
would return in a few days and commenting that he does not
want to use the telephone.

Later on the same date, JOSEPH BONGIORNO was observed
with PETER A. MAGADDINO and the subject. BONGIORNO indicated
that he was having trouble with his Social Security. The
informant ascertained during this conversation that BONGIORNO
was born 9/6/16, that his parents were GUSEPPI BONGIORNO and
CONSTANCE GAROTTO (ph), and that he has Social Security Number
101-03-8193.

It should be noted that in this discussion the subject
stated the correct spelling of BONGIORNO's mother's maiden
name was CAROTTO (ph) with two Ts.

Copies ef this letter are being furnished to the
Bureau, Albany, and New York for information purposes and in
Cian of the conjectural relationship of the Assemblyman, JOSEPH

ARLINO.
