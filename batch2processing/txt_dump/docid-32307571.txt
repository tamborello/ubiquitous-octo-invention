LA 62-5111

Local 495 in September, 1961, but that the employees
knew they were members of a union and that they did know
this transfer took place.

; The number of SCHEIB workers belonging to Local

- 886 were few (approximately 100) and the dues collected
by them over a two year period $84,260) did not seem

: of great enough magnitude to warrant any large payoff

' - from HOFFA to DORTA (CSLA 4350-c estimated $250,000)

: although the SCHEIB contract was Local 886's largest and

: it does not seem logical that they would give it up for

nothing. It was indicated, however, that the possibility

exists in the future that the Teamsters may. grant a

charter to Local 886. ‘

 

/ Lake -

As far as RICHARDAKAVN Cee ce a loan and
putting up borrowed stock as colla eral.in ™ attempt to
hide the percentage of pay off he received on the SCHEIB
deal, investigation showed that he did receive a loan ~
but the collateral (stock) was in his name .and had been
in his name for a year or two prior to the SCHEIB deal
and that the loan was paid off through the. sale of some of
the same stock. .

SCHEIB and KAVNER did fly _to San Francisco in
the SCHEIB company's plane on 7/18/61 to meet with JAMES
RIDDLE HOFFA to talk over the transfer of SCHEIB workers
in Southern California from Local 886 to Local 495

! and to give SCHEIB a chance to talk to HOFFA concerning

fr the possibility of his opening up new shops in Northern .
California with Teamster contracts, but this would not —

\'. be considered unusual taking into consideration Mr. SCHEIB's

idea of having all of his shops under one international
union. (Review of records show that the majority of
SCHEIB's. shops throughout the country were represented
| by Teamster Locals up to two years prior.to. the transfer
I of the Southern California shops from Local 886 to

Le oS Local 495.) :

  
  
 

li. Mr. SCHEIB admits to meeting ANTHON Chd: f
i Delmonico's Restaurant on one occasion Ww th PET I

ha and others whom he does not recall and may ‘be* or

fi two other occasions but there is no way of knowing at this

i, time how many times or how well SCHEIB does know DORIA.
