MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Center for the Study
. of Intelligence

FROM: John Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

’ SUBJECT: Meeting with JFK Assassination
Records Review Board

. This memorandum is for your information.

1. On 18 May 1995, members of the Directorate of
Operations and the Historical Review Group met with the
JFK Assassination Records Review Board to discuss the
declassification of CIA records. The Board had requested
the meeting for purposes of educating its members as to the
- categories of information that probably will require
continued protection, i.e. by deleting words or inserting
substitute language.

. 2. The discussion focused on some 30 documents that
describe CIA operations in Mexico City at the time of the
assassination. Among the categories of information
discussed were: locations of stations, surveillance methods,
intelligence liaison relationships, names of agents and
staff officers, and pseudonyms and cryptonyms. In a number
of instances we suggested alternative ways of describing
sensitive information, which the Board seemed to find a
reasonable approach.

3. No decisions were made by the Board during the three
and half hour meeting, but the session was highly productive
in terms of providing the Board a basis for understanding
material in documents related to sensitive sources and :
methods. Board Chairman John Tunheim told me that the Board
found the discussion very helpful in helping them fulfill
their responsibility for approving or disapproving all
recommendations to withhold information. The Board's
Executive Director, David Marwell said it was a valuable
meeting, and he complimented the Agency representatives for
being willing to engage in an open-minded discussion that

was “not scripted.”

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director

FROM: ' Brian Latell
Director, Center for the Study of
Intelligence
SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Records Review Board

1. Action Required: None. This is for your
information. (U) : ;

2. One of this Center's major responsibilities over
the past year has been as the Agency's intermediary with
the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board
(AARB). The presidentially appointed Board was created
by 1992 legislation with broad authority to review
assassination records held by government agencies and
privately with the objective of publicly disclosing the
maximum possible number of documents. The five member
Board is chaired by John Tunheim, the Principal Deputy
Attorney General of Minnesota. The substantial staff is
headed by David Marwell. Currently, four cleared members
of the staff are at this Center virtually full time for the
purpose of reviewing the Kennedy records which we maintain
here in the Ames Building. (U)

3. Neediess to say, CIA records--Lee Harvey Oswald's
201 file, Mexico City Station records, and large quantities
of operational material--are of keen interest to the Board.
Our Historical Review Group, headed by John Pereira, has
done an impressive job of coordinating Agency relations with
the Board and overseeing the declassification and release to
the National Archives of Kennedy-related records. About
220,000 pages already have been released, a large percentage
of them with redactions to protect intelligence sources and
methods. The Board is not due to complete its work for
about another two years and our support for its mission will
continue to be a major, time-consuming responsibility. (S)

4. It is likely that the Board eventually will want us
to declassify operational details from-our records that
Agency components will not want to release. If we were
unable to broker a satisfactory solution--as John Pereira
has been able to do in all such cases thus far--we would, of
course, bring the issue to you and the DCI. The law
stipulates that in such instances the President “shall have
the sole and nondelegable authority to require the disclo-
sure or postponement of such record...” (S)

5. At some point you may want John and me to brief you
on this entire matter, although I do not believe it is
urgent to do so. The Board has advised us that it will want
to meet with the DCI, probably in the next two months or so.
Finally, for your information I am attaching a memorandum
from John providing a recent update on Board activities.
