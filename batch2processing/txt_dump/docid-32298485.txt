Both have utilized techniques previously employed by
BOSCH prior to his December, 1968, conviction for ship
bombings, coaspiracy, and extortion, TORRIENTE and
BOSCH have publicly denounced each other dn the past. wl

Ny
MM 1550-KS has advised that ATOM. CONSTANZO

. PALAU is rather illiterate and not likely xesponsible

for written threats, although capable of oral threats

and violence. \Si e4 ) fa 1 ; (

It appears CS cry that CONSTANZO would

. Place his owa name as the author of a threatening
letter. \ )
- Previous investigation of TORNES in 1970 |

veflects that JULIO ATON CONSTANZO alleged in November,
1969, that TORNES wag responsible for placing two

%. gmall bombs at Station WOBA on 10/19/69. Information.

was also received that TORNES alleged that a friend

of CONSTANZC's was responsible for that bombing.

In early December, 1969, CONSTANZO disappeared from
the Miami scene when he became a fugitive charged with
murder of ROBERTO GONZALEZ, He returned several months
ago, ag mentioned above and is free in Miami, uU

Abcve information reflects the existence of
bad fealing between TORNES and CONSTANZO, It,
therefore, appears logical that TORNES, if he prepared
the "zero" letter, might place the nate of CONSTANZO
as the auther for reasons of revenge. :

Miami file reflected that TORNES was formerly
head of the Ejedite Secreto Anti C.munista (ESA)
(Anti-Communist Secret Army) which was allegedly
involved in bombings and other acts of terrorism
several years ago. Gy an : _
