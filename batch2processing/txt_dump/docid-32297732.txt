DETAILS: Navarrete has been a central figure in the intrigue
surrounding the bombing of captioned Cubana airliner. He is a
former Miami informantlwho has been an unpaid confidential -source i
of Legat, Caracas. As an official of DISIP, Navarrete was :
responsible for the care and debriefing of Orlando Bosch Avila,

an .anti-Castro terrorist who had sought refuge in Venezuela and
is.now being held in connection with the Cubana bombing.

Navarrete has provided information obtained from Bosch to

Legat, Caracas, including the allegation that @uillermo and

Ignacio Novo were responsible for the murder of Orlando Letelier
former Chilean official in Washington, D. C., on 9/21/7646 ,. a

As evidence mounted that the Cubana bomb plot was hatched |
in Venezuela and that a number of present and former Venezuelan
officials were implicated, Navarrete went on the offensive and
attempted to discredit CIA, FBI and the American Government !
through telephone calls to Miami news media. Recently, Raul Diaz, |;

. a Dade County, Florida, organized crime officer traveled to i
Caracas to persuade Navarrete to testify in the Florida trial of i
anti-Castro bomb figure Rolando Otero. Diaz confidentially advised ,;
our Miami Office that he was told by Navarrete that Navarrete
participated in two meetings in Caracas at which plans to
bomb a Cubana airliner were discussed. Navarrete also related i
that if Luis Posada, one of the persons arrested in connection with |
the bomb plot, were to talk then he (Navarrete) and others would go_ |
“down the tube" in a Venezuelan styled Watergate. Navarrete became |
an embarrassment to the Venezuelan Government after forcing
three American journalists to leave Venezuela on.10/21/76.
Venezuela now denies the existence of Navarrete and Navarrete is

: reported to have called his-Miami, Florida, girlfriend and told

i her not to call as “he does not exist."(Q u)

 

 

ae By teletype 11/4/76, Legat, Caracas, advised that

ea ot Navarrete desired to meet with Legat on 11/4/76, but was unable

‘ o to keep the appointment indicating that he was being held against i

his will. In a cryptic telephone conversation Navarrete mE

that he had a lot to tell Legat but could not talk over the
phone and that he was “'going across the border." Navarrete
‘volunteered that one person was "behind everything" and gave the
name "Remberto. "® ; ;

C¢\Remberto Uzcatequi was the Director:... of DISIP during
period that Posada was a member of that organization.| Legat did
not know what cryptic comments of Navarrete meant but no
; elaboration wag offered’ by Navarrete and conversation was
terminated. re (ur

Nd believed Navarrete is being kept in seclusion, and
that he m ees to leave Venezuela possibly going to Miami,
Florida. (f.

Plu speculated that if Navarrete returns to the
United States he may be able to shed light on Cubana bombing and
Leteliér's assassination. Xt .

.

. In another development Raul.Diaz, supra, received a
telephone call from Navarrete late on 11/3/76. In this call i
Navarrete alleged "that the CORU meeting in the Dominican |
Republic was sponsored by the CIA." CORU is an anti-Castro.

, terrorist group which has taken credit for numerous terrorist
acts throughout the Caribbean since June, 1976. CORU was formed
as an umbrella organization at a June, 1976, meeting in the

: Dominican Republic attended by five anti- Castro terrorist groups.

: It is believed that Navarrete was referéing to this meeting. @ yy)

In this telephone call Navarrete also told Diaz that if
George Gomez, Alfredo Chumaceiro and Armand Santana were out of
jail at the time of the Letelier bombing then they were
responsible for it. If these men were in jail, according to
Navarrete, then y” of their associates perpetrated the Letelier

bombing. “& yw
