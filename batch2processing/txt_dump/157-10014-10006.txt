historical problems is not being applied, as I understand it,
to current operational efforts or investigative needs. There
an entirely different philosophy being applied as to what may

be required in terms of understanding the counterintelligence

 

threat to this nation. There is very little emphasis, if any, dr
concern with such things as deception and disinformation. merd
is little application of analytical and assessment work to the
overall role of foreign intelligence and security services in
political action,

There have been some fundamental changes in operational
philosophies stemming from an application of what is termed
management by objectives as it is being applied in the CIA to
Operations, and there is a -- has been a distinct change in
some of the attention which has been previously placed on the
problem of penetration from foreign and particularly hostile
intelligence services into the American community.

And there has been a very, very substantive change in
the perception and the conduct of counterintelligence in that
there has been what is in my view a very serious erosion
of security and compartmentation of Operations, and leakage
of information which has not been to the best interests of
a national counterintelligence effort.

Mr. Johnson. So, from going from a rather centralized
apparatus to a decentralized ‘situation, the dangers of penetration

have increased,

Mr. Miler, The dangers of penetration have increased
significantly, and this extends also to the methods by which
relations with foreign intelligence services are conducted.

Mr. Johnson. But how do you respond to the criticism that

during your tenure and Mr. Angleton's tenure, too tight a
rein was kept on counterintelligence information, and individual
in the field at. the station level failed to get the information
they needed to conduct their counterintelligence operation?
Mr. Miler. I would have to respond to that, Mr. Johnson,
and I could only respond to it in the context of specifics,
To my knowledge, and as practiced from my position as Chief of
Operations, whenever there was information which was judged
to be of significance, importance to a field station, that
field station was advised, unless there was some overriding
security source protection or other considerations, and the

decision then not to advise them was made at the Deputy

Director for Operations, as it is now called, or the Director

 

level.

There was, certainly, a very tight security, a very
tight compartmentation of counterintelligence information and
activities, which in my view was essential, and still is

i
essential, and will be even more essential in the future if |
i

we are to regain a counterintelligence initiative and to do
our job in the future, And I think this is the fundamental

question that the management of the CIA and the Senate and the

Mr. Johnson. So both of you left the CIA in December, 1974

Since that time we understand there have been some changes
in how counterintelligence igs conducted at the CIA,

Could you give us some understanding of those changes?

Mr. ‘Angleton, I would like to defer to Mr. Miler on this, |
if I may?

Mr. Miler. Yes,

My understanding is there have been some rather fundamental
and substantive changes which are @ continuation, actually, '
of changes that were made first in 1973, in July of 1973
when many of the centralized counterintelligence functions were
decentralized and reallocated to different components of the
Directorate of Operations, Such things as agent approvals and
security, operational security reviews for intelligence
collection and covert action operations, the oversight on
intelligence operations, and oversight on counterintelligence
operations in the field were decentralized. Research and

Analysis has been curtailed, and the emphasis on it has changnd |

 

 

There have been changes in the record procedures,

London, and then eventually to Italy, and I took over as

I returned in about ‘47, '48, and various jobs in both
espionage and counterintelligence. At one time Chief of
Operations and eventually Chief of Counterintelligence, and

that was from about 1954 ‘until 1974,

Mr. Johnson. Mr. Miler?
