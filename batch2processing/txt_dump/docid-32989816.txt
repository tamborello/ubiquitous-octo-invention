COST OF RESPONDING TO INQUIRIES FROM

OTHER AGENCIES, CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

AND REQUESTS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
AND PRIVACY ACTS (FOIPA)

By communication dated 1/14/76, the Bureau advised
as follows: -

As you are aware, the FBI is currently responding to
inquiries from various Congressional committees and agencies such
as the General Accounting Office. In addition, we are having to
devote ever larger amounts of resources to the handling of requests
under provisions of the FOIPA.

While much of the effort required to process these
matters is expended at FBIHQ, the field offices are increasingly
being called on to give responses. From time to time in the past,
the cost of responding to the inquiry of a particular committee or
agency has been monitored when this was deemed appropriate.

Since it appears thé high volume of inquiries. will
continue for the foreseeable future, it is necessary to provide
for an efficient, standardized mechanism of collecting cost data
and reporting the time spent servicing requests from all oversight
groups which will be instituted immediately. The time spent on
FOIPA matters will also be reported through this centralized
system. As major inquiries from new groups are received, the
time spent servicing these requests should also be reported.

EBI reportedly kidnaped
radical political jigure.

SWASHINGTON ~; Federal Bureali
of ivectigation (FBI) agents kidnaped
a‘tadical political figure within the Jast
five years in an attempt fo frighten him
aiid deter his positical activity, a well-
placed FBI -source disciosed yesterday.

i incident. involved agents in the
ania ine ‘York City field office, the
FRBE,,source ‘said. Neither the name of
the ‘Mletim nor the Jocation of the ‘kid-

ing could be learned. .

mining source said the incident could
pticome part of a Justice Department
investigation into other illegal tech-
niques, allegedly used by the FBI, in-

ding burglary. .
oeathes souree, a former agent in-th

FRI's New York office, ‘said ‘he coullt

coifirm that kidnaptings were directed
against. domestic radicals as well ¢s
foteign espionage agents, raising the
possibility that Justice Department faw-
yers may find evidence to support in-
dictments on those charges.

(The New York Times reported in
March 1975 that the bureau had_ kid-
pnaped and interrogated foreign agents
it discovered operating covertly in this
-peountry.)-

These sources said in interviews that
kidnaping was also used to get infbr-
mation from or to “disrupt” the actiyi-
ties of domestic radicals,

The source said he could cite at least
rone Kidnaping within the last five years,
the period under scrutiny by the Justice

» Department. The sourcejsaid two agents
shad been jnvolyed in sizing a member
offthe radical New Litt to “disrupt™

‘Aclivities plannea™ py thm. ane vicuin,
the source said, would not know he had
been kidnaped by FBI agents and would’
probably think his abduetors
radical right wing opponents of the
antiwar movement who might kill him.

The source said the {vo agents had,
inducted the kidnaping without formal
akthorization Srom the bureau. We said
the Victim was roughed up but was re-
Mased “without permament damage.’s

Both sources said this was not an
isolated ingident over the last decade
and that some of the men who had con-
dueted burglaries new about or had
been involved in such kidnapings.

Manwhile, a well-placed governmeit
Sourte said that evidence in the invest.
