After Mr. GOLDBERG became a.Certified Public Accountant in. the
State of Maryland in 1932, he decided to engage in public
practice of accounting on a full time professional basis. At
that time,” thé economic situation'in the country was poor and

he found it difficult to make @ Living. In’ about 1937,. he
developed Mr. ROY MC GINNIS as a client. MC GINNIS operated a
music machine distributing business and is currently in the coin
machine business urder the name of Roy McGinnis Corporation,
Maryland. Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland. In about 1940, Mr., MC GINNIS
took Mr, GOLDBERG to Pittsburgh, Pa-'. where he introduced him to
SAM MANNARINO and his associates who were in the same type of
business. At the request of SAM MANNARINO and some of his
associates, he took them on as clients and performed auditing

and tax return services for them. Through ‘MANNSRINO he became
associated with SEBASTIAN: JOHN: LA .ROCCA, MIKE GENOVESE and
ANTHONY RIPEPL. ; He also became. acquainted, with CHARLES J,
MARGIOTYT,.: then. attorney, and political power in Pennsylvania

who is. now deceased. Through MARGIOTTI he took over the accounting
for the Filben Corporation of Chicago, Iliimois, which was :
organized to manufacture coin operated music’ machines. Although
this company ‘has been defunct for a long time, Mr. GOLDBERG”

made other’ ‘Contacts which resulted’ in developing clients: “For ay

 

 

Music | company’, which was’ organized by JOSEPH @IGLIOTTI and LOUIS
COMI. When the Filber bs peta pet ran Ange: finaneigi Seat har pe

of ‘by. MARGIOTTI and his associates, He also realized that these

~ men were engaging in questionablé activities and felt that if

he..continued his association’ with them it cowld jeopardize his
standing as an’ accountant.
In ‘about 1950, he decided to discontinue his. relationship with
MARGIOTEE and his ‘associates. He wrote registered letters to”
MARGLOTTI, ‘GENOVESE; RIPEPI and’others, advising them he would
no. longer, handle. théeir-accounting. At that time he would have
discontinued Ris association with LA ROGGA except for the fact
that he was then doing accounting for LA’ ROCGA in connection
with some litigation: involving most of LA ROCGA's financial
interests. LA ROCCA asked him to continue doing his accounting

work at.least until litigation: wes sompleted. .Actually, this
situation has continued amd LA ROGCA has become further indebted
to him, so. that at present LA ROCGA owes him a considerable :
amount of money for accounting fees. >>

In the past: several years, LA ROCA has, entertained Mr. GOLDBERG
at his residence for dinner and,to meet his: family. Therefore,,;:
in the latter part of 1957, when Visiting with LA ROCC A, :
Me. GOLOBERG invited him:to attend the wedding of his son, which...
was. to be held at Philadelphia, Pa.. In February, 1958,. the
wedding was held and LA RGOGGA appeared accompanied by ANTHONY
RIPEPE, .At this time, LA ROCGA stated that his wifeowas. 112

and could not. accompany him. Mr. SOLDSERG at. thet.time’ did net
‘know that LA ROCCA was wanted by the Government or'that ‘there. was
any Federal. Grand dary proceeding in. which EA HOGCA : was: davolved.

 

He ‘Hegaliea that when he last visited: with al “ROGCA. ‘prior, te the
wedding, LA ROSCA was having some trouble with hds threat,. but.
at. -the, wedding he did not nobice any trouble im this: regard. ;

    
  
   
 
 

Mr. GOLDBERG emphatically stated 4

information: furnished by him. He assured the. interviewingoagent
of his desire to cooperate fully’ with the FBI in any investigation
where he: could be of assistance, Although he furnished) no: informa-
tion of particular. specific. importance it was believed by. the
interviewing agent that his friendly attitude and co@peration merit
recontact so’ that if anything specific arises in which GOLDBERG
can furnish immediate assistance the proper groundwork will
aiready have been laid.
