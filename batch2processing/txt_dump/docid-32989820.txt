the Honorable Clarence M..Kelley, the Director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

Mr. Kelley was appointed Director in July of 1973 ina
troubled time for the FBI. His experience as an innovative
law enforcement administrator in charge of the Kansas City
Police Department for over ten years, and his previous work as
a Special Agent of the FBI have made him uniquely qualified
to lead the Bureau.

The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation
extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over
the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the
openness of the FBI's witnesses before this Committee, and
their willingness to consider the need for legislation to
clarify the Bureau's intelligence responsibility.

It is important to remember from the outset that this
Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's
activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic
intelligence operations. We have consistently expressed our
admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative
and law enforcement work, and we recognize the vital importanc
of counterespionage in the modern world. But domestic
intelligence has raised many difficult questions.

The Committee has also concentrated on the past rather

than on present FBI activities. The abuses brought to light

in our hearings occurred years and even decades before Directo

Kelley took charge.

The Staf£ has advised the Committee that under Director
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse. The
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli
gence operations, and less on purely domestic surveillance.
The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in
developing policies and standards for intelligence. These
are welcome developments.

Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved.
Therefore, we have invited Director Kelley to share with the
Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress

should take into account in thinking about the future of

FBI intelligence. Among these issues are whether FBI surveil-|

lance should extend beyond the investigation of persons
likely to commit specific crimes; whether there should be
outside supervision or approval before the FBI conducts certai
types of investigations or uses certain surveillance technique
whether foreign related intelligence activities should be
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement
functions, and what should be done to the information already
in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in
the future.

The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange

of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney
