17. Remarks (by: SAC):

It is noted that this source has not been overly ,
productive during the. last 90 day period; however, the Chicago {
Division made re-entry within that period and relocated a second :
"mite" unit in the: front portion of the Armory Lounge which it is : ‘

u felt will be more prodyg ive in the future. However, due to lack . |
of sufficient time and, ecurity purposes, the. completion of this .
installation was not accomplished. It is felt that this location . ;
is still the number one location for GIANCANA's headquarters. and |
the Chicaga Division is doing its utmost to complete relocation of i
source. In view of above, it is recommended that this source t
be continued for an additional 90 days UACB. (4| ] i
