that part of his job was to keep track of Harvey who was

the nature of the plans and attempts, their time sequence,
and the cast of characters. McManus admitted that he was
surprised that these were just now being called to his at-
tention. He told us that assassination was "a completely
different ball game". Indeed he stated that assassination
was in his opinion senseless; "viz., our leaders would have

been sitting ducks".

Chief and later Director of the Cover Staff.

 

In mid-December 1961, Helms asked McManus to apply his

 

 

 

expertise to the Agency's Cuban Defector Inter-
rogation Center. M¢Manus headed for Florida on Christmas
Day and spent the following week at the Opa Locha Center.

He reported directly to Helms on his findings, conclu-
sions, and suggestions in a memorandum dated January 3,
1962.* McManus recalls that the "center" was then inopera-
tive; he called for an immediate operational restructuring.
McManus stressed the importance of the positive intelligence
that the Center could, and indeed eventually did provide

at the time of the Missle Crisis.

It was not until early January 1962 that Helms formally
brought McManus "on board" as his assistant for "Cuban
activities. The initial weeks were dedicated to ensuring
that the revitalized Center got off the ground; subsequent

MEMORANDUM BR
TO : Fritz Schwarz
FROM: Paul Wallach
DATE: July 22, 1975
RE : Staff Interview of George McManus (Monday, July 21, 1975)

As we discussed last week, I asked George McManus to come
down for an interview Monday evening. The interview lasted approxi-
mately three hours; the substance of that interview — as reconstructed
from both Joe DiGenova's and my own notes — is reflected in the at-
tached memorandum.

McManus should make a brief appearance before the Committee.
He worked closely with both Helms and Harvey, and his testimony will
allow a different perspective on the Mongoose operations and the as-—
sassination issues.

McManus will also testify as to his perceptions of Robert
Kennedy, and Messrs: Helms, Lansdale, MeCone, and Harvey. More spe-
cifically, McManus may show us that Helms was not as "on top" of the

Cuban operations as he would have had us believe on June 13 == 4 posi-

tion from which he attempted to back away during his most recent Com
mittee appearance.
