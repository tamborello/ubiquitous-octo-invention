documents in full. The release of the information in these 61
documents will reveal the identities of 158 individuals who were
described as potential criminal informants (PCI), potential
security informants (PSI), security informants (SI), Cuban
sources, sources of information (SOI), confidential sources (CS)
panel sources and established sources; release foreign
counterintelligence information.

(U) The ARRB held a public meeting 6/5/96, and voted on
new operating procedures. The rules will decrease the number of
members needed to make a quorum to three. This may impact the
forthcoming decisions for the FBI, since a vote only takes a
majority. Two of the ARRB members normally present at-meeting
are very pro-disclosure oriented.

(U) The 61 documents pertaining to the decisions from
the current meeting, which the FBI may wish to appeal, are listed
below by document number with the information to be released.

The current status of informants and sources, if found through
research, is noted after the name with living (L), deceased (D),
