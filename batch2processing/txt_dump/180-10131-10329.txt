Mr. Goldsmith. How long have you been working for the
Office of the Inspector General? \
Mr. Shaw. Since August of 1976. |
| Mr. Goldsmith. Did you have any responsibility in the
| writing of the 1977 Inspector General Report pertaining to
the CIA's handling of the investigation of the Kennedy
| assassination?
Mr. Shaw. None whatever.
i -Mr.. Goldsmith. Has anyone ever interviewed you before
| pertaining to the Mexico City situation as far as it pertained
' to Oswald?
Mr. Shaw. Yes. It was about that time of '76, some-
Hl -
body interviewed me in the CIA Headquarters building, and I
think it was a Senate Committee, but I amvnot sure. They had
some files. : eee
{ : Mr. Goldsmith. Did you give your testimony under oath

at that time?

Mr. Shaw. No, not that I remember.

 

Mr. Goldsmith. Did any CIA person ever interview you
concerning Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City and
the operations of the Mexico City station?

Mr. Shaws. I would have to qualify that. We discussed

the subject, of course, in Mexico City at the time of the
assassination, or immediately after the assassination.

was. an American citizen there, to find out what the story

Mr. Goldsmith. However, by virtue of the arrangement
