-Some months ago, the Los Angeles LCN "Family" sold
out their hidden 30 points in the Desert Sands Casino, owned
and controlled by Los Angeles gambler, NICK GUST SIMPONIS,
to SIMPONIS. SIMPONIS, subsequently, constructed a luxurious
new casino in Cabazon, California, and vacated the old build-
ing. Through control of three of the five man Cabazon City
Council, SIMPONES was successful in having the city deny all
other gambling licenses and he operated the Desert Sands
Casino with no competition. This has been a most lucrative
operation for SIMPONIS, Various members of the Los Angeles
LCN "Family", especially "Boss" NICK LICATA, have frequently
expressed their desire to again "cut into" this operation
of SIMPONIS. No active steps, however, were taken.

  

On 6/26/68, SIMPONIS contacted LA 4448-C-TE in Los
Angeles, California. He stated that a few months ago, a ;
new city councilman had been elected in Cabazon, California, me
who was now the deciding vote on the City Council. SIMPONIS +
stated that this individual, THOMAS DE LUCA, and two other ‘y
councilmen had issued a second gambling club license. in a
Cabazon to a group headed by EDWARD ROBAN and FRANK BARNESE. ‘
He stated this group had paid $25,000 for the first year's
license. They obtained a lease on the old building SIMPONIS
had first used for a casino and began re-modeling in preparation
for opening in early July, 1968. They indicated this would
provide only temporary housing for their casino and that they
planned a future construction of a big new motel-casino oper-
ation.

 

SIMPONIS told LA 4448-c-TE that he was extremely
concerned over the opening of this new casino as it would cut ’
heavily into his profits at the Desert Sands Casino.

; _.0n 6/27/68, LA 4412-C-TE advised that on the night |
of 6/26/68, SIMPONIS, informant and LCN "Boss" NICK LICATA
had met in Los Angeles, California. At this time, SIMPONIS |
told LICATA of his concern over the opening of this new i
casino. SIMPONIS claimed that the small town of Cabazon J
could not support two casinos and he feared heavy financial
loss from this competition.

: SG
SIMPONIS then requested LICATA's help in closing .
down this new casino. SIMPONIS stated that he would be ‘
willing to refund this group their $25,000 license fee and !
other expenses’ incurred in preparing the casino property for

opening. SIMPONIS stated that he would leave the entire
matter up to. LICATA and if he (LICATA) was successful, he
would make LICATA a "partner" again in the new Desert Sands : i
Casino. LICATA agreed to see what he could do in this matter, rn
stating that he (LICATA) could not handle it alone because Df
he must take care of "my people".

Based on information received from SD 1064-C-TE,
Special Agents of the Los Angeles Office observed a meeting
of several Los Angeles LCN "Family" members on 7/6/68. Among
those present were "Boss" NICK LICATA, "Under-Boss" JOSEPH
DIPPOLITO and member JOSEPH LIMANDRI. On 7/10/68, SD 1064-c-TE
advised that LICATA had discussed his contact with SIMPONIS,
as set out above, and LICATA indicated that his group would
contact the principals of the new casino in Cabazon and dis-
cuss SIMPONIS' offer with them.

  

Both SD 1064-C-TE and LA 4412-C-TE have furnished
information on a virtually daily basis since the meeting on
7/6/68 relative to this matter. Based on information received
from these sources, meetings between LICATA and his group :
have been observed on 7/21,24/68 and a meeting between LICATA
and SIMPONIS on 7/24/68.

 

_ Both SD 1064-C-TE and LA 4412-C-TE have advised
that the principals of the new casino have been contacted and
SIMPONIS' offer discussed with them. Both sources have 4
advised that LICATA, at least until the date of this report,
has handled this as a business offer and no threats of any
sort have been.made to the casino principals. ~_—.

Both SD 1064-C-TE and LA 4412-c-TE have advised
that these principals have advised that they prefer that
SIMPONIS purchase between 20 and 50 points in their new .
enterprise rather than accept the original offer of SIMPONIS.
These sources have advised that LICATA is in favor of this’
plan as well as having the new casino group purchase a few
points in SIMPONIS' Desert Sands Casino. In that manner,
LICATA could share in the profits of both enterprises and
with the two groups as partners, they would-control the
entire Cabazon City Council and, thus, prevent the issuing
of another gambling license to any other group.

LA 4711-C-TE, since his original development in
October, 1967, has furnished valuable information in such
connection. This source advised that he, himself, is one of
the principals in both of these panguingue clubs, the
Celebrity Club and the Almont Club. This source has advised
on various occasions that once these clubs had’ paid off their
original ‘opening expenses, that he, informant, would see to it
that "Boss" NICK LICATA received a regular share of the pro-
fits. :

LA 4711-0-TE advised on 3/14/68 that MANUEL ."RICKY"
JACOBS, Los Angeles area gambler, was: "fronting" various
investments in the Almont Club. Informant stated that, among
( others, the LCN "Family" formerly headed by THOMAS LUCHESE
of New York had invested $180,000 in the Almont Club. Inform-
ant stated that the LUCHESE money had been invested through
New York bookmakers, CHARLES -MEYERSON and HERBERT LIEBERT
(deceased). Informant noted that JACOBS had been a former
bookmaking partner of LIEBERT. According to informant, JACOBS
has not paid any of this money back to the LUCHESE interests
and informant stated that JACOBS was in real trouble if the
LUCHESE interests do not receive, shortly, a return on their
investment. .

 

 

On 3/28/68, LA 4711-C-TE advised that on 3/23/68,
he had met at the New Yorker Hotel in New York City with LCN
member CARMINE TRAMUNTI of the LUCHESE family and TRAMUNTI
was accompanied by Attorney SCHECTEL (phonetic) who has repre-
sented members of the LUCHESE family. This meeting according :
to informant concerned the investment by the LUCHESE LCN i
"Family" in the Almont Club. Informant stated that TRAMUNTI !
reiterated that the LUCHESE "Family" was a partner in this
investment, having invested their money through New York book-
maker, CHARLES MEYERSON.

. On 5/17/68, LA 4711-C-TE advised that during the
past week, CARMINE TRAMUNTI, New York LCN member, his attorney,
(FNU) SCHECTER (phonetic) and WILLIE ROSEN had been in Los
Angeles. The purpose of the visit was to attempt to determine
the status of panguinque and- what could be done for the return’
of the money invested by this New York group. Since the
panguingue clubs were now permanently closed, informant noted
. that this group would continue their efforts to obtain their
! money back,

In this same connection, SD 1064-C-TE advised on
5/3/68 that he had attended a meeting in Los Angeles on 4/26/68.
Present at this meeting were LCN members JOHN ROSELLI, LOUIS
TOM DRAGNA, FRANK BOMPENSIERO, "Under-Boss" JOSEPH DIPPOLITO
and "Boss" NICK LICATA. - :

SD 1064-C-TE advised that at this meeting "Boss"
NICK LICATA explained that his predecessor, "Boss" FRANK
DESIMONE (deceased), had set up a detailed investments in Los
Angeles panguingue with the THOMAS LUCHESE LCN "Family" of
New York.and that later this New York "Family" interests were
worked out with "Little Steve" of this "Family" after LUCHESE
became ill.

 

From comments made, informant received the impression
that, in the past, the LUCHESE group had invested between .
$110,000 and $1207000 in Los Angeles panguingue activities
and that at the present time this group has between $180,000
and $185,000 invested, This money has been spent on Pan Club
rent, card tables and attorney's fees to fight the various
injunctions formerly and presently outstanding prohibiting
this activity. According to comments. made at this meeting,
informant did not believe the LUCHESE group has currently
received "$0.25 back on their $185,000 investment". ROSELLI
told the group that in his opinion the LUCHESE group would
be unable to recover any of their money and the pan clubs
would not be successful in getting the injunction lifted
banning their operation.

At this meeting NICK LICATA explained that he had
been attempting to work out details with HAROLD "HAPPY" MELTZER |
regarding the LUCHESE investment in Panguingue. LICATA stated ‘
‘that in the event they were successful in lifting the |
injunction banning panguingue and after the LUCHESE group
got their original investment of $185,000 back, that the Los
Angeles LCN "Family" would thereafter receive 25% of the
profits from Panguingue.

 

In connection with the Los Angeles LCN "Family"
interests in the luxurious, legal card casino, the Desert
Sands Casino, in Cabazon, California, the following is perti-
nent: , :
