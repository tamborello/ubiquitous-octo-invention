authoritics, incidents terrorizing the population and kidnappings, as in the
case of Colombia, or more specifically, Nedellin and Cali.

"The plan of the comunist sympathizers is designed to create a cli-
mate of uncertainty’ on the continent again," said the Lina daily, adding
that all kinds of terrorist incidents, attacks, kidnappings, ete., are being
used.

In the case of Colombia, these acts are designed, as high officials
asserted at the beginning of this month, to facilitate obtaining economic
resources for the reorganization of the FARC fFocrzas Amnadas Revolucionarsas
de Colombia; Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombias guerrilla movement,
which is currently in a state of complete collapse.

The recent attacks made in Medellin on the homes of the head of the
DAS {Bepartmento Administrativo de Seguridad; Administrative Department of
Security/, various well-known professional people and the premiscs of the
newspaper El Diario, like the kidnapping of the Antioquia rancher Ruben
Norena, are a part of the plan of the extremists pursuing the Moscow line.

Bulua Incident Not a Kidnapping Attempt

Cali, 23 July (by Cristian Martinez Sarria). The report that the case

involving Ignacio Ayala Mosquera was one of attempted kidnapping has been

  

entirely discredited. In this connection it was revealed that all that: oc-

curred was an attempt at extortion comitted by a former national police ;

F-2 agent, according to a highly placed spokesman for that armed branch.

The incident occurred on Tuesday in Tulua, when Carlos Alberto Lozano, ‘

a former F-2 secret agent with a dishonorable discharge for bad conduct from

 

that organization, accompanied by Phaller /name not clearly legib le? Idarraga a
and Jose de Jesus Ortega, demanded a large sum of money under threat of ar- vt

rest fron Ignacio Ayala Mosquera, who had previously been arrested several

 

times for the illegal practice of medicine.

Police spokesmen added that Lozano and Idarraga were carrying photo-

POLITICAL MOTIVES BEHIND COLOMBIAN KIDNAPPINGS

Source: El Tiempo, 25 July 1989

Day before yesterday the Lima dafly La Tribuna, the most ‘prestigous
newspaper in Peru, charged on the basis of information obtained from Interpol
that the reasons behind the kidnappings of rich ranchers and farmers which
have occurred in Colombia recently are political.

Echoing the charges made in the editorial pages in recent days by

“the Buenos Aires newspaper La Prensa, the Lima daily also claimed that there

is "a vast plan for communist subversion on an international scale affecting
Colonbia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia equally."

In reporting the activities of three Sovict KGB agents in South

America, this daily said that “they travel under the guise of trade union

‘leaders, and that "one of them, Lenov, is the employce of the Soviet Em-

bassy in Mexico who turned over to Colombian bandit Felicizno Pachon the
sum of 100,000 US doliars for the subversive groups in that country."

_»  Lenov is traveling in the company of the KGB agents Alexander Oper-
kunov and Victor Dednikov. And no one is unaware of the fact that shortly

after the visits of the "trade union officials" to various countries on this

This increase in violence in Colombia, to which must be added the re-
cent gang attack in San Jose de Urama, similar to the incidents of past years,
occurred immediately after the charges made a few days age by the Buenos Aires
daily La Prensa, one of the most serious and prestigous newspapers on this
continent. On this occasion, the Argentine newspaper made editorial mention
of Colombia as one of the countries which will be most seriously affected
by the communist violence, along with Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.

The facts indicate, moreovcr, that despite the ideological differ-
ences, the various "Naoist," "Castroist," and "Muskovite"™ categorice of con-
munist fauna are solidly united and pledged to the plan of terrorism and
violence denounced in these charges. .

We are in a position to inform the public that the DAS /Departmento
Adninistrativo de Seguridad; Administrative Department of Security/, the

police and the army have in hand infomation revealing that the Colombian

Communist Party, a supporter of the “Moscow linc," has issued instructions

_ to all its affiliated organizations calling for immediate engagement in

secret activity.

fhe same sources have stated that the kidnappings of Mister Norena

- and Doctor Gonzalez were similar in motivation and method to the kidnappings

comnitted in past years by FARC [Feerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia;
Revolutionary Amed Forces of Colombia/ bandits, resulting in the murder of

the well-known businessmen Harold Eder and Oliverio Lara Borrero.

 

The FARC, as everyorie knows, is a paramilitary organization established :

by the pro-Soviet conmmists and headed by "Tirofijo" (Dead-eye}, of unsavory

notoriety, who is a member of the Central Committee of the Conmnist Party

supporting Moscow. Precisely in order to revitalize this organization, which
had been reduced to the most precarious status thanks to the patriotic efforts
of the armed forces, an official of the Soviet Embassy handed over the sum of
100,000 dollars to Colombian communist Feliciano Pachon Choconta in Mexico.

Fortunately, he was found and captured when he was on the point of success-

fully completing his prophetic mission. Oa the subject of this notorious

matter which had worldwide repercussions at the time, the Lima daily La

“‘Tribuna identified a Russian called Lenov in a series of recent reports, as
“the Soviet official who gave Pachon the money in Mexico," and, on the basis
of information obtained from Interpol; it added that Lenov is traveling with
two other KGB agents, Alexander Operbunoy and Victor Mednikov, all claiming
to be "trade union leaders," on a fantastic tour which covers precisely the

countries mentioned in the Buenos Aires La Prensa as the targets of the new

.comnmunist plans for violence, that is to say, Colombia, Venezucla, Ecuador,

- Peru ad Bolivia.

According to the Lima daily, La Tribuna, these three Russians were
recently in Colombia, and it was precisely after their stay here’ that the
kidnappings and acts of violence referred to erupted.

Providing an abundance of detail, the major periodical Ya, published
in Madrid, Spain, also analyzed the communist plot against Colombia and the
other Latin American countries in a very recent issue. According to this
Madrid daily, the headquarters of the Tass and Novosty news agencies are

real “hotbeds of espionage and subversion” in which the most fillesible?

activity of the Soviet comaunists is carried out.

COMIUNISTS PROMOTE VIOLENCE IN LATIN COUNTRIES

Source: La Republica, 25 July 1969

The kidnapping of which the noted“doctor and rancher Ernesto Gonzalez
Caicedo was recently ‘the victim in Cali has served to confirm, tragically,

7 ‘ the existence of a vast commmist plot to subvert the constitutional order

a
cong apes enennennneenaeannrntearttneitnrathenit henaetiientineetleiintiiiaateteintaneneeatin eT

and to plunge the country again into a wave of terrorism and violence which

fo! - appeared to be buried forever.

 
   
  
   
  
   
  

an . In fact, this newspaper, like the other dailies in the capital, re-
, ported in ‘its 12 and 18 July issues, on the basis of official statements,
that the Department of Valle had been selected by the pro-Sovict canmnists
as the scene of the continued wave of terrorist attacks and assaults and
kidnappings recently begun in the Department of Antioquia.
Following the kidnapping of Antioquia rancher Ruben Norena, the kid-
. Mapping of Doctor Ernesto Gonzalez Caicedo has now oceurred. The communist.
bandits are demanding the enormous sum of 4.5 million pesos in ransom.
| Thus the chronological stages in the new, subversive plan are being carried
: : out, beginning with the steps which are obvieusly designed to obtain the
| , money necessary to finance the bandit gangs in the tural areas they have

1 ' already selected.
