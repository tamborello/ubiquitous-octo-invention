He stated that he had done-his share of killings in the ¢

PG 92-228 |

Washington County, Pa. Numerous sources had previously
referred to ZEID as a "trigger man" for the MANNARINOs of
New Kensington, Pa., and other "syndicate groups" for many
years. .

On January ll, 1966, PG p-5 advised:

If the Federal Bureau of Investigation were to
check and find out the identities of two young men whom
SAM MANNARINO was instrumental in getting out of United ;
States Penitentiary, Lewlsburg, Pa., approximately one month
before MANNARINO himself got out, two of the murderers of
AL ROSS would. be known, :

On February 18, 1966, PG 2-3 advised:

: Recently, it was suggested to MANNARINO that he
may have had some part in the shooting murder of AL ROSS in
1965. MANNARINO laughed. and stated that this. would have been
impossible since he was not released from the penitentiary

‘until June 1, 1965. MANNARINO treated with disgust the

rumor that he had managed to secure the release. of two young
inmates from the penitentiary and had hired them to do the

shooting. | MANNARINO said he had not grown so ora as to
stupid enough to send a couple of "young punks" to do hi
killings for him and possibly put him in the electric'c

and if he were going to do-one today; he would do it hin
possibly accompanied by someone with whom he has done busine
for a great many years.

the way "we" used.to.do in the 1930's, MANNARINO said there
had’ not been a racket killing in the Pittsburgh, Pa., area,
up until’ the shooting - -of “AI ROSS; for 30 years. MANNARINO
was abked how he could gianaliéy, that statement with the .
frequent murders in the’ Chicago, all., area, and in the
recent—past, in Youngstown;~ Ohio. MANNARINO replied that
