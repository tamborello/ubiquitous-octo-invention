4a Enclosure, as is a biographical sketch on Edentity’s father.
As Enclosure shows (aeauming only that Identity resided with his
‘Sather ‘hig teers), Identity spent his yeuth (from 8 te 21
| years of age) in PRPRIME, graduating from a PRPRIME university.
Considering his and his family's long residence here, there is
& reasomable likelihood that Identity is pro-PRPRIME and would
‘be cooperative. :

_- @. Ef aasesement is fevorable and recruitment is recommended,
it is suggested that the initial preposition be coached im terms
of Identity becemiag a political observer for us, sot an espionage
agent; we prefer te solicit hia “confidential ceoperation", hoping
te phase in covert requirenents after he has ecoperated fer a
while tug has become accustomed te taking d rection,
