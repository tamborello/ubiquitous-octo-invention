Request for Unescorted Official Visitor Badge

ADDENDUM: SECURITY COUNTERMEASURES SECTION (SCMS
NATIONAL SECURITY DIVISION (NSD), 5/4/95 FEB:feb

 

The Security Programs Manager (SPM), SCMS, approves the
request for an unescorted Official Visitor Badge for
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), employee Laura Denk,
DOB 8/7/67, POB Lawrence, Kansas, SSAN 509-82-4982. Ms. Denk
will be reviewing records relating to the assassination of former
President John F. Kennedy. Ms. Carol L. Keeley, Extension 9465,
is the point of contact for Ms. Denk.

On 5/2/95 and 5/4/95, appropriate FBIHQ record checks
were conducted on Ms. Denk by a representative of the
Industrial/Facility Security Unit (I/FSU), SCMS; no derogatory
information was disclosed.

On 5/2/95, a representative of the SCMS verified that
Ms. Denk has the appropriate clearance, term certified for a
period of one year, to be granted unescorted access to FBIHQ and
to be granted access to classified material up to and including
Top Secret. It should be noted, barring additional changes,
Ms. Denk's clearance certification will expire 5/2/96, prior to
which time it will have to be recertified for her to continue to
have unescorted access to FBIHQ.

It is requested that Ms. Keeley return Ms. Denk's badge
to the Security Unit, Personnel Division, Room 1127, at the
completion of her assignment. Ms. Keeley should also notify
Ms. F. Brice, I/FSU, SCMS, Extension 6875, when Ms. Denk no
longer requires access to the J. E. H. Building so I/FSU records
can be updated accordingly.
