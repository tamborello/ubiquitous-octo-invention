Colonel [ aise pointed out that the term OTHER 4 foreign
"insured" by Lloyds 0 ndon is a misnomer as Lloyds do not |
pay out claims to individuals but act as a re-insurance |
organization for other insurance companies and any money
paid by Lloyds is paid not to the individual policy holders .
j but to other insurance companies to help them cover their |
: losses when heavy demands are put upon their resources by
their own policy holders. (4)

{

 

No information was obtained indicating subject or
any of his associates had any kind of an insurance policy
| other than the fire insurance policy mentioned above and
| no information was. available identifying the officers of
the corporation of which subject was a member. (,

As there are no further leads outstanding, this
case is being placed in an RUC status. CK
