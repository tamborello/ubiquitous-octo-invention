Secret Police under former President CARLOS PRIO
(1948-52) and later opposed the BATISTA regime in
Cuba and the TRUJILLO in’ the Dominican Republic.

He served with FIDEL CASTRO. .as civil attache at

the Cuban Embassy in Costa Rica until March, 1960

1962 and has since served in the Venezuelan foreign
Ministry and worked with the Venezuelan National
Police (DIGEPOL). He reportedly served as body
