FINANCIAL SUPPORT

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has apparently traced
large sums of money to banking establishments in Mexico
City, Mexico. Mr. Bernard L, Barker has been questioned
extensively on the funding aspects of the operation, and his
explanations on real estate deals are not being accepted as
the truth. As of 27 June 1972, the Federal Bureau of Investi-.

gation continued to show considerable interest in the financial

aspects of the Watergate incident.

MEDIA GRAPHIX

in Media Graphix, a Washington, D.C. firm with offices at
1730 "K" Street, Northwest, and 919 18th Street, Northwest,
Suite 130, On 27 June 1972, the Federal Bureau of Investi-
