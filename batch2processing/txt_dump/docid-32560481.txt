The Miami Division also advised that no inquiry would be
made at the Golden Nugget Motel, Miami Beach, Fla., unless advised
to the contrary,in view of the fact the Golden Nugget Motel is a
known hoodlum hangout and the possibility exists the inquiry would
reach BRUNO and have an effect on neggtiations of BRUNO, Confidential
Informant T-10, and others involved in the garbage and trash contract.

On February 18, 1958, Confidential Informant T-10 identified
the Senator from Florida, previously referred to by him as "Senator
MORRIS," as being Florida's State Senator JOSEPH EATON. The Informant
insists that the trash collection contract is to be awarded in Dade
County, Fla., which includes Miami and Miami Beach, for both commercial
and residential. T-1O stated he did not know who the attornsy HAFT
or Senator EATON would contact to obtain such a contract. He stated
that necessary negotiations are being handled by the Italian element,
apparently through BSN GALLUP (phonetic).

By airtel dated March 19, 1958, the Miami Division advised
that DAVID GLASS, FBI No. 3733899, formerly from Philadelphia, and
the present owner and operator of the Golden Nugget Motel, Miami
Beach, Fla., was interviewed on February 19, 1958, by SA's ROBERT
K. LEWIS and ELMER F. EMRICH in connection with another matter. GLASS
acvised that he knows BRUNO and that BRUNO was not registered at the
Golden Nugget Motel at that time. GLASS was not receptive to
questions regarding BRUNO; therefore, his association with BRUNO was
not pursued any further.

Credit and criminal checks at Miami reflect no arrest record
located for JOE EATON, Miami Attorney, at the Miami Police Department,
Miami Beach Police Department, the Dade County Sheriff's Office, and
the Municipal Court records of Miami. |

A Miami Credit Bureau report dated June 27, 1955, for the

supposedly told BRUNO at this time that whoever was at fault made

no difference because "FREDDY is my partner." ALFRED IEZZI, commonly
known as FREDDY, has been identified by T-5 as having part interest
in the Television Bar at 8th and Washington Streets, Philadelphia,
with DE TULLIO.

 

Approximately a week after BRUNO contacted DB TULLIO, GUS
MAZZIO, FREDDY IEZZI, and DE TULLIO were standing outside of the .
Television Bar when BRUNO drove by and did not spesk. ‘This apparently
alarmed FREDDY because he said to DE TULLIO "Look, there goes BRUNO
and he didn't even speak." SKINNY said in effect "Who cares."

T-5 also stated that within the last two month period,
MAZ2I0 told him about driving DE TULLIO's car in New Jersey. MAZZIO :
told him CLIVETO was in the back seat being chauffered » and; according !
to T-5, this indicates that OLIVETO is a leader in the Greaser Gang.
T-5 said that OLIVETO took over the position formerly held by MARCO
REGINELLI.. He also stated that OLIVETO was kidding SKINNY and was
not kidded back; therefore, this is some indication that DE TULLIO |
is of lower.rank than OLIVETO. T-3 said that people contact |
D& TULLIO to have matters straightened out and that he always :
1

 

advises these persons that he will let them know in two or three
days, indicating that he has to go to a higher authority to obtain

a decision. T-5 believes that OLIVETO rules on decisions which would
pertain to illegal actions on the part of the Greaser Gang.

Investigation reflects as set out above that BRUNO is
zesoctated with other Philadelphia members of the so-called "Greaser
Mob" who are MICHARL MAGGIO, DOMINICKPOLLIN@, JOR RUGNETTA, FELIX
DE TULLIO, and DOMINIG& SPARAGNO. oO

On April 10, 1958, the Philadelphia Police Department .
arrested ANTHONY PROVENZANO, Philadelphia Police Department No. 288255,
and NICHOLAS RUSSO, Philadelphia Police Department-No. 213145 » in
possession of approximately 100,000 numbers plays. It appears that
these men are possibly pick-up men for the BRUNO faction due to
the location of the arrest on South 8th Street, Philadelphia. There is
a possibility, however, that these men could be employed by another
numbers bank in the South Philadelphia area.

At the hearing on the abové, these men were represented by
Attorney GARFIELD LEVY and were held under $200.00 bail for. court.

W. HOLMES that he understood that BRUNO was still in Florida. He
said that he understands that PHILIP TESTA, mentioned above, is
quite concerned about the FBI having contacted him.

He also advised that FRANK FORTE, Philadelphia Police
Department No. 29927, and JAMES GATTI, Philadelphia Police Department
No. 87357, who are often referred to as being "BRUNO's Boys,"
actually work for JOB RUGNETTA, mentioned above, who in his opinion,
is higher up with the Greasers than BRUNO.

T-11 also advised that RALPH MARANCA, mientioned above, is,
he believes, still in the alcohol racket and supposedly works for
BRUNO but he could not verify this.

on March 6, 1958, Confidential Informant T-5 said he had’
heard that ANGELO BRUNO was in Miami, Fla., ad had recently entered
an unknown hospital in that city, where it was necessary for him
to receive two blood transfusions in connection with an illness, the
nature of which was not known to informant.

T-5 said he had heard this information from BOBBY (LNU),
who allegedly knows BRUNO. He related BOBBY complained to him
that BRUNO formerly hung at the taproom at 15th and Morris Streets,
which resulted in the place being closely scrutinised by the
Philadelphia Police Department. T-5 stated he would attempt to
ascertain the correct name of DBBY(LNU).

T-5 further stated that it is. his opinion that BRUNO is
subservient to FELIX DS TULLIO, wa., "Skinny Razor." He based his
opinion on the following-described incidént which was told him by
AUGUSTINE MAZZIO, wa., Gus, Philadelphia Police Department No. 272611,
who is a partner of CHARIES VENSZIAIE in the operation of a still.

In approximately 1953 or 195) PETER CASELLA,\and ALFRED IEZZI, wanted
to dissolve their interest in the Ticket Gril » 13th and Wharton
Streets, Philadelphia. BRUNO brought a prospsctive buyer to the
Ticket Grill. This prospective buyer, BRUNO, /and IEZZI in discussing
the price being asked for the grill had a heated argument with
IEZZI telling BRUNO "Do me a favor, keep the

out of here." IEZZI then went to FELIX DE TULLIO, wa., .
wSkinny Razor," and told him of the argument. DE TULLIO told IEZZI1
not to worry about it. Approximately a week after the argument,
BRUNO called DE TULLIO and’ told him about the argument. Ds TULLIO

that BRUNO was financing the edge on numbers play for the "Jewish Mob."

CARL C. CIPRIANI, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division, Treasury
Department, advised SA ROBERT W. HOLMES on January 25, 1957, that he
had learned that contrary to general belief, BRUNO is not the top man
in the Greaser Gang but is considered only a trigger man. BRUNO
is ranked below JOSEPH RUGNETTA and PETER CASELLA. CIPRIANI said
these two men cen order an'execution which BRUNO cannot do. CIPRIANI
said that BRUNO allegedly killed MARSHALL (MUTT) VENEZIALE, whose
body.was found in the trunk of his car on a South Philadelphia street
in about 1954. He said VESNEZIALE was suspected of being an informant
for Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division because in 18 years of bootlegging
and operating a still he was never arrested. .

Money Lending

On January 20, 1958, Confidential Informant T-l, who has
known BRUNO for a long period of time, said that he is extremely
wealthy. He said BRUNO is active in lending money, not in small
amounts as a loan shark, but he specializes in lending large amounts’
of money to racketeers who have more income. Informant said that
BRUNO was reported to have made some very big loans to various members
of the "Jewish Mob” and benkrolled them in many of their activities.

By way of background generally, the informant said that
"these people" referring to the various racketeers, are generally
distrustful of ‘banks and probably have the major portion of their
wealth in their homes. He said they do not believe that safe deposit
boxes are entirely safe and these racketeers suspect that high officials .
in the banks have keys and permit the Internal Revenue Service to
examine the contents of any safe deposit box. He was speaking of °
the very wealthy racketeers. He did not specifically bring out any '
information concerning BRUNO but said that he considers BRUNO to be
extremely wealthy.

On January 31, 1958, Confidential Informant T-l) advised
SA JOHN H. BIERMANN that he was indebted to subject's brother-in-law,.
RALPH MARANCA, for approximately $30,000. He stated he is having
difficulty making ends meet and he is paying MARANCA off in small
amounts each week.

purchase of 75 sanitation trucks and two caterpillars at the cost

of about one million dollars and that the contract should bring

an annual return of one million dollars. BRUNO said that it would

be necessary to get the approval of DOMINICK POLLINO (Philadelphia

Top Hoodlum - Bureau File 92-2790) for the necessary outlay of

cash. Later, the matter was discussed with POLLINO and he approved

the proposition and said money would be secured by drawing funds

from various unidentified corporations and business concerns. It

was planned that after the contract is obtained, a "front man”

with no racket background would be selected to conduct the operation.
Qn December 9, 1957, T-10 said that the attorney mentioned

is NORMAN ¥. HAFT, Suite 513, Ainsley Building, Miami. T-10 advised

the Senator is probably a Florida State Senator who has been in office

about three years. :

On January 9, 1958, T-10 said that on January 3, 1958,
ANGELO BRUNO said that the Florida State Senator and Attorney HAYT
wanted 20 per cent of the profit per year for securing the trash
contract. The next day, BRUNO agreed to pay 20 per cent of the profits
per year to the Senator and HAFT for securing this contract. The
contract is to be awarded in the name of BEN GALLUP (phonetic), who,
according to the informant, operates a juke box business for the
"Italian element" in Miami. BRUNO said that GALLUP's affiliation
with the racket element in Miami is not generally known and he is
considered "clean." BRUNO said the contract would probably be

. awarded in about 5 days.

On January 23, 1958, T-10 said that on January 20, 1958,
ANGSLO BRUNO, DOMINICK POLLIN®, and another individual met at the
Maggio Cheese Company, Philadelphia, to discuss the pending trash
contract at Miami, Fla. According to the informant, the Florida State
Senator wanted $30,000 payment now and 20 per cent of the profit annually.
They agreed that the $30,000 payment would be placed in escrow until
the contract was awarded. In addition to that, the Senator wanted to
choose a man and place him in a supervisory capacity in the firm.
The individuals involved were not in agreement with this. There was
to be another meeting at the Maggio Cheese Company on January 23, 1958;
however, BRUNO was not available for this meeting.
