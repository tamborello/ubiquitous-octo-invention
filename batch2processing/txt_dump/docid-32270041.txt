The resolving power is obtained by photographing a series of test bars and
examining the resulting image with appropriate magnification to find the spatial
frequency of the finest pattern in which the bars can be counted with reasonable
confidence. The series of patterns has spatial frequencies from 10 to 223
cycles/mm in a geometric series having a ratio of the 4th root of 2, Radial
lines are parallel to a radius from the center of the field, and tangential lines
are perpendicular to a radius.

 

IV. Indicated Principal Point

Positions of all points are referenced
to the indicated principal point as
origin. The diagram indicates the
orientation of the referenced points
when the camera is viewed from the
back. The direction of film travel is
to the top.

 

 

Indicated Principal Point
to Midsides of focal frame

A Unable to Measure
B 28.79 mm
c 27.96 mm
D 29.34 mm

These measurements were made from a shadow image formed in the focal plane.
The method of measuring these distances is considered accurate within 0.01 mm.

The camera was aligned for calibration by autocollimating on the mounting
surface where the front of the test camera-lens was placed for the film
exposures. It is evident however that this is an indirect procedure, but the
only method possible for a camera of this type. This alignment process made
the front of the lens ring normal to the axis of the collimator bean emergent

from the 0° collimator.

Dear Mr. Goldsmith:

Enclosed is U.S. Geological Survey Report of Calibration No. 419 covering
measurements made on a 620 Imperial Reflex Camera, Commission Exhibit No.
750. These measurements have been made in accordance with instructions
contained in your letter of March 2, 1978. The fee for this work is $320.
You will be billed for this amount at a later date by our Finance Office.

Sincerely yours,

REPORT OF CALIBRATION May 5, 1978

of 2 1/4 X 2 1/4 Camera

; Camera type 620 Imperial Reflex Camera Commission
Lens type DUO Identification Exhibit No. 750
Nominal focal length 77_ mm Maximum aperture £/4.5

Test aperture £/4.5

Submitted by
Select Committee on Assassinations

U.S. House of Representatives
Reference: Letter dated March 2, 1978 from Mr. Michael Goldsmith
These measurements were made on Kodak Verichrome Pan film type 620 ’
developed in D-19 at 68° F for 3 minutes with continuous agitation. This film

was exposed on a multicollimator camera calibrator using a white light source
rated at approximately 3500K.

I. Equivalent Focal Length: 77.55 mm
This measurement is considered accurate within 0.02 mm
II. Radial Distortion:

D, for azimuth angle

Field De $$
angle 0 90 180 270
(degrees)

7.5 0 61 -25 -44 7

15 388 611 331 260 350

22.5 1706 -—- --- 1646 1767

 

The radial distortion is measured for each of 4 radii of the focal plane

separated by 90° in azimuth. De is the average distortion for a given field angle.
Values of distortion De are based on the equivalent focal length referred to the
field angle co-tangent for 7.5°. The radial distortion is given in micrometres
and indicates the radial displacement of the image from its distortion free
position. A positive value indicates a displacement away from the center of the
field. These measurements are considered accurate within 10 um, It is clear
from these variations in the values reported among the four radii from the average
that a substantial amount of asymmetric distortion is present in this lens.
