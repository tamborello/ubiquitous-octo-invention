1. You will remember that we were afle to provide some
advice on precautions against kidnapping to key members of the
Anerican Chamber of Commerce which resulted in exp sions of.
gratitude fron those who knew the source. (See fn footie, 286 of
16 November 1971.) sow, [RRICETONE1 tells me, the tte of the”
Distrito Federal have increased patrol activities around some

U.S. firms, on the basis of supposed information that, there are
threats thea. jase Bt firms or that someone plans to “do something"

 
   
   
      
        

Re he wernt z
the demonstration on 17°-May of which I attach a copy. s0u cia
see from this why the businessmen might be disturbed; the anti-
U.S.-business theme is secondary, in my opinion, and so I told

ERDACETONE-1,., to the opposition’s primary target, the GOM. Also,
1 fold him, we have no recent or speci-ic information of any
group's planning anything against U.S. firms. (We shall check
wien SRBGLACTER-9, to see if he has anything.)

2. SRDACETONEH1_ askéd me if we had anything on plant pro-
tection which he could circulate to the membership in the same
way he did our other production. This would be a pamphlet or a,
series of suggestions as to how a store or factory or office
could take precautions against bomb throwing, bonb planting,
incendiaries, and the like. (That is, it need not deai with
other aspects of security against theft and burglarly but with
Tupamaro~style attacks against facilities.) We don't have any-~
thing of the sort on hand here and we don't have anyone tocally
expert in this. It seems to us the sort of thing which WOBONE
might be able to produce or to get from someone such as the New.
York City Police. You probably have better ideas. If you. send
us a study, let us know what security might be involved: .

3. %I always feel a bit defensive about these requests:
the easy way would be to tell them to go take care of this
themselves. It still seems to me that we can earn or keep
some good will this way as.well as actually helping, perhaps,
to prevent unpleasantness. I hope you can do this without toco
much trouble but I do think it is worth some. Obviously, the
group much appreciated their lunch with you early this month
and this does help out the work.
