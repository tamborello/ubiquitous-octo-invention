The ARRB staff requests access to any and all FBI informant files (or "source" files) associated
with the person or persons designated by any of the following symbol numbers: DL 172-S, NO
172-S, and MC [or MEX] 172-S. Our request extends to any and all such files presently or
previously maintained by FBI Headquarters or any FBI field office, legal attaché or resident
agency, with particular reference to the Dallas and New Orleans field offices and the legal attaché
in Mexico City. Our request includes all files presently or previously maintained on such person
or persons under the "134" or "137" classification, regardless of whether the FBI may have
designated such person or persons as criminal informant(s), potential criminal informant(s),
security informant(s), potential security informant(s), confidential source(s), counterintelligence
asset(s) or any other type of source of information, and regardless of whether such person or

persons ever received payment from the FBI.
