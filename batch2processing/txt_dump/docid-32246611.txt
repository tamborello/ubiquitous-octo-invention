used to come to my place of business.

After the assassination, a lot of the FBI used

to come to my place of business which I had a name, they used

to come to aggravate and to give me a hard time and tell me to

go to the office because the boss wanted to talk to me and
asking me about the same questions over and over and over
until I got’ very tired. I called my attorney which at that
time was Dave McHoward, called George, and explained to
George McHoward what the FBI was doing to me and he told me

to go and see the lawyer that worked at. his office, his

private office. So I went’and talked to John Tambarella and

John Tambarella told me, "Go back to your hosue and get the
names of those FBI and bring it to me and I am going to have
something to work out, something to call somebody and tell

before I go you have to give me your name." They told me

their names. I did not believe it. I said, "You have to

me and I put their names and I hold their names.

Qa , Do you remember how many times you spoke to
Warren C. de Brueys and gave him information?

de Brueys used to come to ny place of business too doing some
kind of investigation and talking to all the customers... He
used to come and talk to customers.

Front office. At the Balter Building was the name of the

“building where the office was. on Camp ‘Street all the way to

St. Charles was.a building with an alley in. the front. The
building had three or four dif ferent entrances.

So I saw him and I talked to him at the office
of the Cuban Revolutionary Front which Arcacha was there
among other members.
