CG 6486-C* was reactivated on 4/15/65. The
Armory Lounge, the location of the source, was closed
until the 26th, which is a normal procedure each year,
it being customary for DORIS FANELLI to give a two
week vacation at that time to her employees. The
following information was reviéwed on the day following
its recording and pertinent information furnished
the Bureau in teletype form. It is anticipated that
this source will be reviewed and furnish the Bureau
in airtel form on a daily basis in the future. (y)

On the 26th, BUTCH BLASI opened the restaurant
with DORIS FANELLI at which time they discussed operations
of the restaurant and of the fact that a new waitress
was to be hired who formerly worked at Pucci's Restaurant.
One item of pertinence was a remark by DORIS FANELLI
to theeffect that prior to her taking over the Armory
Lounge, she was never familiar with most of "Sam's
(GIANCANA) friends such as FIFI (BUCCIERI) and the
others." During the afternoon on this date, SAM
GIANCANA was present and met with one MIKE (LNU) who is
believed to be possibly identical to one MIKE "The Brew"
MORENO. MORENO is known to have been influential in
Stone Park - Northlake and an associate of ROCCO PRANNO's
in the operation of D'or's Lounge. Information available

CG 92-350 SUB E

On the 29th, DORIS FANELLI complained to
BUTCH BLASI that a lot of her customers were going
out to "Orries" because "he told them all to go
out there." It is assumed he is SAM GIANCANA.
In this regard, CG 6792-PC furnished information to
the effect that during the period that the Armory Lounge
was closed, SAM GIANCANA was utilizing the bar called
Orries as a hangout with his associates. (UU)

BUTCH BLASI was then noted to place a
phone call to VINCE SOLANO; however, nothing of
pertinence was gleaned from this phone call. It is
noted that SOLANO is a close associ and chauffeur
for Chicago Top Hoodlum ROSS paso. (U)

During the afternoon, GIANCANA was in and
was complaining about income taxes claiming that the
Government is checking his back to 1961. He continued
"You got to add it all up real careful because you
got to figure they're always around. It used to be
you could go someplace and not figure they knew it,
but now the (obscene) are all around you. I always
check it all up. I figured it in years to come I could
accumulate so much money, and in:four or five years
(did not complete sentence). This year I made
less and paid more. It used to be you made 50 and
keep ee)

Later CHUCK ENGLISH arrived and in a

conversation with an unknown individual began a ?)
lengthy dissertation on the question of immunity.
ENGLISH: I been arguing with my

son-in-law and a couple other
lawyers. If this law is
passed what happens is there
a is no more fifth amendment.
: I don’t care what no lawyer
tells me. I take the fifth
: amendment no matter how much
‘ ' immunity they give me.
Because taking the fifth
amendment you ain't gonna get
in no trouble. Open your
mouth and you don’t know what
