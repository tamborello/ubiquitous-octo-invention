SE 711-S advised the letter created a noticeable
impact on Seattle CP youth members and served to enhance
the confusion which has perm@ated the CP youth movement in .
‘Seattle with the: formation of. the. W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs of
America.

. Seattle concluded that. the ACTMLCP produced.
excellent disruptive results in Seattle youth circles

Seattle. .

Anonymous Mailings

NY 3953-8* advised that BILL ALBERTSON and
HY LUMER “recently. discussed the problem of anti-Semitism
in the Soviet Union. ALBERTSON said that some of the
Jewish comrades have. been getting letters on. this, are
distutbeded by them, and that some,actually believe this KX
propaganda. ALBERTSON asked LUMER for. his. opinion as mh
to the best way to combat this propaganda. LUMER said he
’ is. working on an article which will set out the truth
in this situation (a)

on 6/17/64. NY 2362-S* furnished information
about a conference at CP Headquarters that date where _—
the discussion centered for a time on the various anonymous
letters sent under the counterintelligence program in
New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. GUS HALL said
at one. point he thought the FBI might be involved in
. this matter,

on 6/24/64, NY 2359-S* advised that the
-receipt of anonymous letters by.CP leaders were
‘discussed at a conference in CP Headquarters that day.
JACK STACHEL said he thought there was no doubt there
is a centralized agency devoted to making our work as
difficult as possible. The possibility was also
mentioned by several individuals that the ultra-right may be
involved in sending the letters. PHIL BART said the
committee would have another discussion on the letters.

WILLTAM ALBERTSON

The expulsion of WILLIAM ALBERISON has presented
the CP- with a complex series of problems. There was
"a great deal of concern over the amount and quality
of the information he presumably. furnished to the FBI, ot
and they discussed the’steps they must take to minimize the
damage. The leaders are concerned over the effect this will
have on the membership and some members apparently have SANT :
doubts that the Party chose the best course of action in '
this matter. It is difficul# to overestimate the
damage that has been caused) :

 

As of this writing there continues to be new ,

‘ developments. A more comprehensive summary ‘will be

made.of the ALBERTSON, eyputsion at the time of the
next monthly letter. (cs) ; ;

5. INFORMANTS PARTICIPATING
IN THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE
PROGRAM

NY 384-S and NY 1117-S were not able to. participate ;
in the nterintelligence program this past month.. fj
ny [2124 visited CP Headquarters in connection: with: ALBERTSON'S
expulsion. Consideration was: given to having this | ; :
informant make certain suggestions that would pass doub’s
doubt or suspicion on other CP. members as regards the “&
ALBERTSON expulsion, but because of the difficulty 7
in predicting how this would work out no recommendations
have been submitted to the Bureau.

NY 388-8 had: been an. informant designated to
participate in the counterintelligence program. NY 388-S's
_— club became inactive after the CP learned there was a .

i leak somewhere. Since ALBERTSON's mother was also in t a!
this club, there may be some chance that NY 388-S can co"
-be -re-activated: after“the CP fixes. responsibility for
the leak on ALBERTSON CEE

. On 1/31/64, the Bureau approved a plan designed
to suggest that the FBI has an informant in the NY COunty CP
Committee. This would be done by leaving a list of names
of those who attended the previous meeting where it’
could be found by a member of the County ‘Committee. The ~
NYO has not been able to put this plan into operation,
because the meetings-were being held in private homes ‘\
In view of the expulsion of WILLIAM: ALBERTSON on
charges of being an informant, the NYO will abandon
this plan for the present, but will resubmit the
plan or a similar plan if deemed advisable in the
future. :

 

 

Camp Webatuck

The NYO has still not determined the identity
of the church group that is reportedly interested in.
buying Camp Webatuck. When this information becomes
available appropriate counterintelligence action will
be recommended .

 

 

The “Bureau has granted Detroit permission to
mail an anonymous letter to ELIZABETH GURLEY FLYNN which
would be critical of the way Party affairs are being handled
in Detroit.

NY 100-129802

On 6/16/64, SE 775-S* advised that certain CP
youth members in Seattle who received a copy of the
ACTMLCP letter were seriously concerned as to the
significance of the letters as well. as the individual
or organization that might have mailed the letter. They intended
to make extensive inquiries to determine the question of
the madi ings.

 

SE TAlL-S advised that this matter. was discussed
at an Executive Committee meeting of the King County
Youth Club held in Seattle on 6/16/64, There was
much discussion as to the significance and origin of
the letter and it was finally decided the letter was
probably the work of some splinter group. Those .
attending: this meeting observed in a somewhat guilty
manner that their approach to the new youth organization

might be considered revisionist. One member thought
he might have. received the. letter because he has been an
outspoken critic of the. new..youth organization. It
was. decided this matter. would-be taken up with the
Youth Commission of the Northwest District of the
Communist Party. : :

By letter dated - 6/26/64, seattle advised
that KAY NORTON, an acting County CP Youth Commission
Chairman continued to express concern over receipt
by her and several other CP youth of the ACTMLCP letter.
NORTON believes. the letter came from Progressive Labor
and that her name was furnished to Progressive Labor by a
former CP youth member who has left Seattle.

Other members of the CP youth clubs in Seattle
share NORTON's observations and a great deal of discussion
has been had over the contents of the letter.
