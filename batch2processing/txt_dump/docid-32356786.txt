has continued to be very helpful to her by supplying

her with Dlackmarket food, loaning ner her automobile, and other-

}
wise assisting her with her problems. Identity B may be |
carrying out such actions on a genuine friendship basis,

(she has. even been denounced by the neighborhood defense |
‘committee "as assisting gusanos") or she may be buying insurance {
for the future. The possibility also exists that she is remaining i

a confidant of Mrs. AMLEO-3 on orders of AMTHUG-1 and is

' yeporting on all developments to AHTHUG-1. In early September

1963 Baul PRIMELLES (201-327902) arrived at Identity B's

home for—a_visit_while Mrs. AMLEO-3 was present, Mx and Mrs.

PRIHELLES ignored the presence of Mra. A-3 and did not speak

' to-herewhile greeting Identity B. Because of this Identity B
promptly turned her back on her visitors and did not answer

them, continuing her conversation with Hrs. AMLEO-3, Mr. and

_ Mrs. PRIMELLES were thrown inte some confusion by this reception

and departed from the area.

13. During the reporting period AMLEO-3 has consistently
been cooperative with his c/O and has maintained a good attitude
towards his work. During the latter part of Agust 1963 AMLEO=-3
began to lose. his patience with the slow progress in getting
his wife into asylum, and began requesting. permission to return
to Cuba himself in order to exfiltrate his wife black. AMLEO-3
became: quite demanding in this regard and claimed that KUBARK's
time had run out, and since he had waited patiently for nine
months he now felt it was his turn to try his luck. AMLEO-3
ig extremely confident of. his own ability in action situations
and operations and extensive argumentation was needed to
persuade him that such a courge of action would be suicidal
for his wife and children and that his wisest course of action
would be to give us additional time to bring the asylum operation |
to a successful conclusion. Because of AMLEO-3's faith in a
higher authority, Cos JHWAVE, Andrew BK. RRUTEMAN visited AMLEO-3 3.
on & September 1963 for the purpose of convincing him that any 4
uailateral. action on his part would. only be counterproductive
and playing right into. AMTHUG-1's hands. KUBARK's limited §
commitsents to AMLEO-3 were also reviewed along with the history
of our actions to help his wife and children leave Cuba legaluiy. 4
After some frank exchanges of facts AMLEC-3 was finally convinced 4

best. Absolutely no further commitments were made. to AMLEO-3
during these discussions and alternate courses of action if
the asylum attexpts fail were not discussed but instead left in
abeyance. ae ; ‘

15.1 WAVE. Station regrets that reference C has not been .
answered to date. In reply we can only state that AMLEO=2
was thorcughly briefed on the limitations of his alias documentaticn
when said documentation was issued to him. He was told that the
credit card documents could never be used for identification or
_ credit purposes. He had also been warned to avoid situations
where he would be asked for positive identification, such as
‘yenting.a car, and by attempting to procure a rental car in
ZRMETAL he was acting contrary to instructions given to him .
by bis 4 670. On AMLEO-3"s return to WAVE he was castigated for
his actions, and again briefed on the limitations of hfs alias
documentation, In order to strengthen his alias documentation
an I.D. card document identifying him as an employeeeof "Charles
S.. Wilson Associates” has been issued to him, as suggested by
(Chester D. DAINOLD. ta conversations with AMLEO~3 in ZRMBSTAL.
. In regard to points a and b in paragraph 2 of reference C,
} ‘the KURIOT re resentative in WAVE Station states that the Florida
_ @ravers License. issued to Joseph A. Reese Is a valid, backstoppea
'  @rivers license. for actual use by the Subject and the address
a legitimate safehouse with. backstopped rental. cover. Subject's
cover story was that he recently moved to the Miami area from
New Crleans, Louisiana (which city the Subject lived m for
- @everal years and has relatives residing there). The Subjct's
_ documentation: ig therefore correct for his cover story. The
spelling of “instalment” on the National Credit Card was correctly

 
          
 

point out that “instalment™ is not only correct according to the _»
dictionaries but.is the spellingsof the word which is now frequently.

as’ "instaluent" w one . would be appreciated I D>.
Headquarters would in the future coordinate with KURICT in

Headquarters on questions. which déal with AQUATIC matters prior to

querying WAVE.

  
 
 

Costs

16. AMLEO-3 continues to receive a flat salary of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) per month, and also is paid approximately
one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month for purchase of foodstuffs

_gince he is encouraged to eat his meals in the KUBARK
spafehouse and stay out of public places. fe have also continued
to pay the wife of AHLSO-5 the amount of one hundred and twenty five
dollars ($125.00) per month for subsistance for herself and her
- two children to supplement the $120.00 per month she receives
from, the Cuban Refugee Center, The C/O has continued his efforts
. to find part-tize employment for Mrs. AHLEO-5 so that KUBARK
‘could be relieved Gf the necessity to support her, but to date
we have. been. unsuccessful in our efforts primarily because Mrs.
AMLEO-5 has never worked in her life and has no work skills
whatsoever. No other financial expenditures of note were made
duribg the period, and no financial assistance is presently
contemplated for. any other AHLECs.

INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION *

‘17. During the reporting period no positive intelligence
reports were dissemiaated by the AMLEO group since none of the
’ active agents are lecated in the target area, nor do they
_ circulate in Cuban exile circles. . -

18, We are continuing to utilize AMLEO-3 as & consultant
on. the MHAPRON program, and to this end are planning to have
. him expand his reporting of personality information on selected
4dndividuals and to utilize him to explain interconnections
between various individuals and groups as they take shape ‘L -
MHAPRON research. . . . ; : _

CPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

1. This report will cover the period SU July 1965 through
15 September 1963. and is a follow-up report to reference A.

EFFORTS TO LEGALLY EXFILTRATE AMLEO~3 FAMILY FRM CUBA. .

 

- 2. "Since transmission of reference A to Headquarters several
‘developments occurred which effectively eliminated several alternate
_ solutions to the problem of the AMLEO-3 family in Cuba. The
‘ alternate solutions that were eliminated, as found in paragraph
5 of reference A, were (a) "Haintain Status Quo as a Family
attempting Leave Cuba via Offices of Swiss Embassy as Part of the
American Repatriation Program"; (b) "Have AMLEO-3 Family
‘Withdraw Papers From the Swiss Embassy and American Repatriation
Program and Attempt Leave Cuba as Normal Refugees via Mexico
Or Spain”; and (e) "Have the AMLEGS Family Case Taken up With the
. GOC Through the ‘Donovan’ Channel for Possible Legal Exfiltratica”.
- Elimination of the. above alternates left only two solutions
that were at all feasible; (c) "Have the AMLEO=-3 Family Take
Asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mexban Embassies in Havana",
or (d) "Have the AMLEQ-3 Family Exfiltrated black in a Maritime
' Cperation by either a KUBARK or Independent Maritime Tean."
Because of the inherent risk involved in a black exfiltration,
it was decided that the AMLEO-3 family should be put into —
asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mexican embassies with all

possible speed.

3. Fo this end steps’ were initiated in on 24 July 1963.
to put the AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 into asylum in the Mexican
Embassy in Havana. The AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 were advised

via the AMWEE-1 OWVL channel on 4 August 1963 to prepare
themselves for asylum and to await further orders via the same
channel, KUBARK Station in Mexico City, meanwhile, took urgeat
action through its Hexican lizison’ channels to have the Mexican
Foreign Ministry obtain visas for the AMLEO-3 family and
AMLEO-2; and then send word to the Mexican Embassy in Havana,
Cuba that the AHLEO-3 family and AMLEQ-2 should be granted asylum
when they appeared at the Mexican Comeulate under cover of
obtaining their visas. The visa portion of the operation was
satisfactorily completed and notification of same was sent into
the Mexican Embassy in Havana; but word re asylum for the
AMLEO—3. family and AMLEO-2 was not sent to the Mexican embassy
due to insecure commo channels and lack of trusted couriers, and
' .to date no secure method haa yet been found to notify the Mexican
- Embassy . in Havana that asylum should be granted to the AMLEOs.

; 4. AS a/result of the above, word was sent to ANWEE-1
_ via OWL on,1l September requesting he detemine whether or not
‘Identity A‘ would be willing to act as intermediary to receive
the AMLEO-3 family and. AMLEQ-2 into asylum at a specific tine
and date at the. Mexican consulate. AMWEE-1 asked for
clarification on the manner of approaching Identity A on the case
on 13 September via pouch, and more detailed guidance on the
matter was sent to him via OWVL on 14 September. A final. reply
re possibilities for action via this channel is expected from
AMWEE~1 momentarily. If the AMWEE-1 reply ia favorable, then
he will be told te arrange the meeting at the Mexican consulate
between the AMLEOs and Identity Ai so that they can be taken into
asylum by the. Mexicans.

- 5. As noted in reference B, if the AMWEE-1 report is a
negative one, then consideration will be given to having the
AMLEOs take asylum in the Uruguayan Embassy in Havana. The

_ test case utilizing AMCANOE-3, mentioned in paragraph 5 A of
reference B, is to be attempted on or about 21 August 1963, and
if this attempt at asylum is successful then arrangements will
be made to have the AMLECS enter the Uruguayan Embassy in the
game manner. —

| 6, As noted in paragraph 1 of. reference B, the wife
of AMLEOQ-3 finally made a direct contact with ANTHUG-1 on 7
September 1963, while he was at his Santa Maria beach house, ‘
and appealed too him for permission to leave Cuba with her
childrei and rejoin her husband AMLEO-3 in the United States.,.
On 14 September 1963 AMLEO-3 received a letter from his wife
giving wore details on the above meeting. The wife of AMLEO-3
had been visiting the beach home of a family friend, situated
next to that of AMTHUG~1 on Santa Maria beach, on a daily basis
hoping to see AMTHUG-1. Finally, om 7 September 1963, she saw
-him swimming alone in the ocean and promptly went into the water,
introduced herself , and requested prmission to talk to him.
AMTHUG~1 granted ths permission, and during their conversation

| AMYHUG-1 made it clear he would not grant Mrs. AMLEO-3 permission

  
  
 

to depart Cuba at this time, stating that the tine was not
-prepitious due to the attacks and raids being carried out
against Cuba, and that Mrs, AMLEO-3 would just have to wait.
Mrs. AMLEQO-3 then told him she did mot see why he was holding her a
‘-and her children respoasible for what her husband did; that she Ae
‘feared her husband might forget her and their, children completely s+
(42 the separation ‘continued, and that if. AMLEO=3 was left much res
' Jonger alone he would find a woman to replace her. ANTHUG-1.-° 4.
‘replied by asking her "Do you consider yourself a burden to your By
-husband?" The wife replied "It is possible”, and ANTHUG-1 then
: asked “But he calle you every day."

7. \Later during the conversation AMTHUG~-1 asked
Mrs, AMLEO~3 if her husband still had the presentation Soviet
pistol that he had given him in 1961, and Mra. AMLEO-3
informed hia that her husband had taken it with him when he
- defected and asked ANTHUG-1 if he wanted it returned to him.
| AUTHUG~-] did sot reply to the question. Later on, while
discussing her conversation with AMTHUG-1 with Identity 5,
Identity B suggested to Mrs, AMLEO-3 that she request AMLEO-3
_to send the pistol back to AMTHUG-1 via Ambassador LECHUGA
at the United Kations, NYC. Identity B added that the return
of the pistol might help matters gince the loss of the pistol had
been one of the things that bothered AMTHUG-1 most when
. AMLEG=3 defected. (i.e. AMLEO-3 has noted that these special
presentation Soviet pistols were given by AMTHUG-1 to probably.
less than ten people in Cuba, and their presentation had a very
special meaning for ANTHUG-1 since the recipients were supposed
: ‘to be his very personal and close friends. AMLEQ-3 claims
co ‘that not even AHLOUT-1 had received one of these special
wd -. “presentation pistols from AMTHUG-1,) Consideration is. being
: ' given to AMTHUG~1's. request, if it would assist Ers. AMLEO-3
| -. dn her efforts. to leave Cuba, but for the time being the pistol
| °.. will be held by KUBARE.

 

 

: B.- ANTHUG-1 also told Mrs. AMLEOQ-3 that her husband had
‘gtelen a light plane when he fled and implied (although she
does not go state directly) that he would like to see it
' returned. -The balance of Mra. AMLEO-3's letter concerned her
: . degire te leave Cuba, mentioned the necessity for almness by both —
she and her husband with no rash actions, and without giving
- any additional facts stated that her conversation with ANTHUG-1
had been a long one but that she could not get him to make
any. promiges re her departure,

 

DEVELOPMENT OF OPERATIONAL LEADS TQ DISAFFECTED CUBANS

9.. During the operational period one of AMLEO-3's

operational leads, whom he had written a report on for the
AMTRUNK. PM operation::, was recruited via the recently successful
AMTRUNK infiltration operation and given the crypt of AMTRUNK-10.

: AMLEO<$3 also screened additional ANTRUNK leads and KUTUBE

7 military leads during the period and was abie to submit
reports on some four individuals for these operations. All such
leads were fed to him mixed in with many other Cuban names.
AMLEO-3 igs presently preparing reports on PHS target studies

10, AMLEO=3 also assisted in the handling of AMLSO-5's. -
wife during the period when she egtablished direct telephonic
. > comuunication with her hugband in Cuba, and tried to cdnvince
ov him that she wanted to return to Cuba with her children,
: but stipulated to A-5 that he would have to meet her in a third
country first and resolve their personal family problems. .
AMLEG~3 baby sat for the wife during these calls, since we
only knew. what day the calls would. be coming in and never the
‘hour. He also assisted Mrs. AMLEO-5 in recording the last telephone
conversation she had with her husband. In this same operation
‘AMLEO-}3 also assisted the Case Officer in the conversations
held with the mother cf AMLEQ-5 while she was in the United
States, although he was never allowed to establish direct
' contact with the mother. We had hoped that the mother of
‘AULEO-5 would attempt to establish contact on her own with
‘AMLEO-3, but to WAVE Station knowledge she never attempted to dc
go. If she had, we would have allowed AMLEO-3 to respond to har
‘contact efforts (maintaining his cover as being disassociated
with ODYOKE) . .
