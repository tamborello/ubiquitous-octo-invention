RE: CLIP Wry

Fives not expect that the announcement of the
FRD existence wilf be of any unusual nature. CIA anticipates that
Castro will give it little attention and regard it only as

‘ another organization of exiles. However, it is expected-that
FRD will grow rapidly in strength and prestige. BEV “|

[ane Liaison Agent was furnished a list of locations in
the Miami“area now being utilied by CIA in this operation. The
list is enclosed herewith.] The same data was furnished to SAC PN

Teague of the Miami office,

Liaison has previously reported that CIA would be
utilizing Swan Island located in the Guif of Mexico for the
mounting of a radio broadcasting operation. Broadcasts will, of
course, be directed against Castro and will be beamed to C -
Broadcasts are to be initiated on or about 5-19-60.(S0)(4. uj

CIA is spending considerable time and effort to bring
certain anti-Castro Cubans outside of Cuba so that they can be
utilized in this operation. This is being done on a selective ;
basis in an effort to obtain the services of certain key men .@<f) uJ

   
  
 

connected with the Cas ént and is assigned to an Embassy
abroad. According to Barquin has not been able to make
a clean break with Ca se of action which might be taken

against members of his family. in Cuba. He now feels that he has

this matter under control and CIA thinks that he will officially

severe his connections with Castro within the next few weeks. He

could become a key figure in FRD. Ys )

The headquarters of FRD will be reported as being in

Cuba and will exist in that country in a clandestine status. Branches
will be established in various Latin American countries, and in the
United States. Costa Rica undoubtedly will be a key location.

CIA does not plan to utilize a large number of Cubans for this
operation. There pobably will not be more than 40 or 50 who will
have been briefed and trained by CIA. This group, however, will
| be engaged in a program of training other Cubans outside of the U.S.
There is a plan to use a U.S. base in the Panama Canal zone for —

some of this training. AV OQ(u) °
