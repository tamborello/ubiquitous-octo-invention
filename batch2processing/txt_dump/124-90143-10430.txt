I feel that your lettér states some of the
prob lens , but also states certain limitations (as I -
, See it) in your approach. . Let-me make three points:
first, you speak of"aesthet ics" and “sociology;": ¢
You say, "sociology is: probably dominant". I feel
. there is a danger in this, because it suggests a ‘sep-.
‘_anation of the two approaches’, and I feél that we .
“must achieve an integral approach, Marxist thought. has . |
, Suffered badly in ‘the cultural field from the separa--
_ tion, and a rather stuffy ‘certainty that. sociology is. f
“pRimary: art. in the real sense, the creative realization
‘of human;potentialities, is primary, and I think this
‘view of art (along with its misuse and degradation in

societies which are not creative) is the basis for a
“richer approach,
. ‘Second point: the theme of° "treatment of
-womén ,'t ‘which you mention could, [ think, be infinitely
_more revealing, and more realized. in terms of f£iln--
and through the lens of film, the whole sotial situation. .
. Third point ?'ChronologyYou are. right that
it must Have more freedom-~ forward and’ backward,.but ©
“s@mmhow the frame of reference, the reality of tine Pa
“must, determine the movement. back and. forward, The
. question of time. is-, I think, a central factor in
cinema art-- and it! must be so in your nook. _ ,
