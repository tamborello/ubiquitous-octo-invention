1. The following items from LIBIGHT/LIMUD coverage
concern contacts of Subject who are believed to be of interest:

A. Attachment A: A letter from CAW, the
magazine of Students for a Democratic Society, signed
by Jerry *BODANES, thanks Margaret for her poems
which they are using. The magazine is scheduled to

. be off the press around May 16. The letter cliearliy
indicates that the SDS was behind the student seizure
of Columbia University. It says, "Right now our
glorious brothers have seized Columbia University--
now named Malcolm X University--and over which an
N.L.F. flag now flies. The others, faculty, deans,
managers, are all scurrying and speaking pious--
saying SDS this, SDS that, while we hold five
buildings in joyousness and the most serious
preparations to resist, our movement has over reached."

= Enclosed is a check made out against the account of

 

 

the SDS in the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company,
2681 Broadway, New York, for the amount of $50, and
signed by Robert M, *SHAPIRO.
