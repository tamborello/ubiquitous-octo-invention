4 The attached material was part of a soft file entitled
“American Defectors to tre USSR", which was set up by SR/6 -
(Support) around 1960 and maintained by various SR components ‘
until ca, 1963. The compilations wére derived from a variety
of sources, and contain both classified and overt data,

2. Inthe fall of 1966, the files were turned over to CI
Staff, In most instances, basic information was then abstracted
for the US Defector Machine Program, In all instances in which
the material was unique, or represented a valuable collation effort,
it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with
a copy of this memorandum,

3. It is suggested that any dissemination of this data should
be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MRO), in
view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fect that
disseminations have aiready been made through the US Defector
