interest in the U.6.S.R. continued while he was a student at the
University of Miemi (October 1948 « January 1951) and during this

Russia Today, New Times, Culture and Life) through the Four Con-

Exbagsy in an attempt, he said, to obtain information and literature
and he participated in Wallace's campaign for President, attending
meetings and distributing literature.

NORTHRUP 's interest! in the USSR continued during his overseas
CIA employment Germany from January 1952 to July 1956
during which time he made unauthorized trips to East Germany;
and during his current Air Force assignment in West Germany through-
out the course of which he has said he made 30 to 50 visits to East
Germany “to enjoy the culture.” He hes been described as an ego-
tistical pseudointellectual who is interested in the cultural aspects
of the Soviet Union, had read all of Corliis Lemonts writings, and
subscribed to MASSES and MAINSTREAM. At the time of Subject's defec-
tion, a member of the CI Steff recalled that NORTHRUP frequently
(two or three times a week) visited the Victor Kemkin Book Store in
Washington where he was known and frequently conversed with its
maneger. There is considerable question regarding Victor Kemnkin
and various relatives of his.

According to what appear to be partial reports of interrogation
which the CIA Security Office received in connection with Subjects
defection to East Germany on 6 July 1960. He defected to escape
an alcoholic mother and heavy debts. Subject, an Airman Second
Class, assigned as an analyst with the German unit of the 6900th
Security Wing AFSS, defected to East Germany on 6 July 1960 taking
with him two suitcases and a brief case. He left his West German
apartment at 1800 hours with the intention of defecting (having
earlier in the day left a note for his mother stating that he was
going to East Germany for good) and disappeared into the East
German controlled subway. He returned to his apartment at 0015
hours in the early morning ef 7 July 196 without luggage and wes
placed under arrest.

During interview by military authorities on 11-12 July 1960,
NORTHRUP said that he took with him, when he defected, official
document containing top secret information in order to establish
his bone fides and turned himself in at the defectors reception
center in East Berlin. According to Subject he spoke there with
two officials who told him to sleep there that night and return in
the morning for further discussions. He was deeply disturbed, he
seid at the lack of interest shown in him and began to realize the
seriousness of his actions. After milling around he finally returned
to his apartment in West Berlin to turn himself in. He claimed to
have defected in a fit of despondency caused by long standing frus-
tration. He stated that he first considered defecting in November
or December 1959 because he believed he had no future in the service
and felt that he had to get away from his mother who had become a
confirmed alcoholic.

It would appear, however, that Subjects long time interest in
the U.S.S.R. may have played a part in his defection. He has admitted
to a sympathetic interest in the Soviet Union dating back to his
high school days when he frequented the office of the Soviet American
Friendship Society in Miami and did wolunteer work for them. This
