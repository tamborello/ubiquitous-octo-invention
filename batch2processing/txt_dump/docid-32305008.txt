. EPSTEIN and TANG-Ming-chao indicated that they are
"quite active and busy". They said that the CP of China has
prepared 13 articles which will be published in refutation of
articles concerning the Soviet-Chinese dispute appearing in
the Soviet press. ‘

In reference to the above, it is to be noted that
it was reported on 5/21/59 by NY 1572-S that JAMES S.H. LEE,
current Editor of the "China Daily News", was very close and a
favorite of TANG Ming-chao.

It has been reported by NY 4047-S* that RICHARD and .
SUSAN FRANK have had several contacts with JAMES and ANN LEE, °

Since the inception of the current investigation 6
of the subject and her husband, she has been engaged in
activities of the Progressive Labor Movement which organization
espouses the Chinese Communist cause.

Ny 4047-S* has reported that the subject has been in |
frequent contact with individuals in the U.S. who are pro-
‘Chinese Communist.

NY 4112-S* has reported that the subject has been in
contact with individuals in Peking and with people abroad who
are believed to be pro-Chinese Communist.

Observations:

The fact that RICHARD FRANK returned on 10/5/63 from
England tends to verify the information from NY 694-S* that the. .
subject and her husband are engaged in activities on behalf of -
the government of China and one of their intelligence targets ,
is the CPUSA, and in furtherance of this purpose it is believed
RICHARD FRANK met with TANG Ming-chao in London.

It is the observation of the NYO that the subject's

| association with the LEEs and the China Daily News would furnish
a convenient means of communication between China and the FRANKS ,
it being noted that CSNY 3333-S has furnished information to the
effect that the China Daily News receives current news releases
from the China News Service; the news releases are from Peking,
Shanghai and Canton.

NOTE: ~

The extremely sensitive source referred to in instant
letter is NY 694-S*,

Susan Frank and her husband, Richard, are suspected
of being agents for the Chinese Communists in the U. S., not ©
only by the Bureau but by CP, USA, It appears that liaison with
Chinese Communists is maintained through Israel Epstein and

TANG Ming-chao, who have headquarters in the office of a member
of British CP in London. [If we can persuade British to intensify
coverage of individuals in London, possibility exists, we may
ultimately learn details re Chinese Communists activities in U. s.{3)
