reply to a letter which HIRALLES said he had sent te MASIERRER,

STRALLDS said that in his letter te HASPERRER, he had

( suggested the advisability of setting up an organization within. -
: Cuba aleng Communist-cell lines, since he, an admitted ex-Con-
munist, felt that this was the only way of combating the Castro

Government, which he chaims is completely influenced by the

’ Communists. MASPERBER, in his letter to MIRALLES, cormented that

he thought the plan was 4 good one and suggested HIRALLES would
