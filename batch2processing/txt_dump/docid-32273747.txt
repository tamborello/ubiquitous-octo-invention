Dear Dr. Rhoads:

As the Select Committee proceeds with its investigation of
the question of possible U.S. involvement in the assassination
of foreign leaders, it finds that it needs to review minutes
(or memoranda of conversation) from meetings of the National
Security Council conducted during the Eisenhower, Kennedy and
Johnson Administrations, as well as other NSC materials. We
have recently ascertained that such material may be exclusively
lodged in the Presidential libraries. Members of the Committee
staff have been in touch with Dr. Reed and Mr. Jacobs of your
staff. They indicated that NSC minutes should fall within the
"section 11" category for White House documents--that is,
documents to which the Archives can grant access on its own
authority. They did indicate that you would, of course, consult
with the White House; that should be no problem given the
understanding the Committee has with the White House about
access to documents necessary to the assassination inquiry. Our
contact point at the White House is Mr. James Wilderotter
(496-7094), who should be able to provide the necessary clear-
ance.

Members of the Committee staff have been in touch with
the three libraries (Messrs. Wilson, Moss and Middleton),
notifying them of our need to review NSC materials. We under-
stand from them that an oral assurance from you that the clear-
ance has been obtained will suffice. The members of the staff
who will be reviewing those documents are (with the security
clearances each possesses): David Aaron (TS/SI/TK/B), Karl R.
Inderfurth (TS/SI/TK/B), Loch Johnson (TS/SI/TK/B), Robert

Kelley (TS/SI/TK/B), and Gregory F. Treverton (TS/SI/TK/B).

We are interested, of course, in documents which make mention
of assassination or possible assassination; in addition, we would
like to review those NSC materials which would assist us in
setting the context of events we are examining. The countries
and periods in which we are especially interested are: the Congo,
from January 1960 through February 1961; the Dominican Republic,
from January 1960 through July 1961; and Cuba, from mid-1959
through 196).

Since the Committee intends to finish the assassination
portion of its inquiry within the next month, and since next week
will begin taking testimony to which the NSC documents may be
relevant, it would be helpful if staff members could review the
NSC materials later this week. We would appreciate your assisting
in such expedition.

Sincerely yours,

PHL FP + 7:

Frederick A. 0. Schwarz, Jr.
