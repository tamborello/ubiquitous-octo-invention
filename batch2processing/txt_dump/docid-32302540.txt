RE: GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka.

- SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka.
AR

On 6/12/61 SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III observed a 1960 Plymouth
Fury sedan, black bottom and white top, Florida license # 1W22076,
parked in the driveway of GABRIEL MANNARINO's cottage, RD #3,
near Leechburg, Pa. It is noted that the above license was

J previously furnished incorrectly to Miami as 1802276.

Va On 6/12/61 PG 615-C and PCI [ __aavisea SA FORSYTH:

Gambling in New Kensington, Pa., remains very slow, much to the
distress of the MANNARINOs and their underlings. Gamblers are
frequently heard to opine that after the General Elections in ,
November, 1961, the MANNARINOs will be able to "get to" the

new Mayor and things will open up again.

SAMUEL and GABRIEL MANNARINO, whan‘in town, continue to eat lunch a
daily at the Bonfire Restaurant, Leechburg Road, Allegheny Townshig

 

 

Westmoreland County, Pa., and they invariably bring visitors and

guests to this establishment.

Miami will obtain holder of Florida license # 1W22076.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS. (i)
