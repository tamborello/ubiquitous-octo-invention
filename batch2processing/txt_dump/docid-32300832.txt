RE: JOHN ROSELLI, aka

. . '
val IV 10-C advised that on 9/2/64 mail which was being

held for ROSSELLI at the Desert Inn Hotel in Las Vegas had -
been picked up. This informant did not actually see
ROSSELLI in Las Vegas.

On the morning of 8/31/64 Special Agents of the
Ias Vegas Office observed KATHY HORDEN, ROSSELLI's current
girl friend, driving a new Buick Riviera bearing Nevada
license plates CF 3019, near the Desert Inn Hotel. She was
thereafter observed to drive to 213 Kendall, where she parked
in front of an apartment.

DMV records, Las Vegas, reflect CF 3019 is registered
to a J. A. BOYD, 3501 Maryland Parkway, for a 1957 MG. It is
to be noted that in Nevada, the license plates go with the
owner rather than the vehicle when the vehicle is sold.

LA 4268-C advised that he observed ROSSELLI at the =,
Friars Club in Beverly Hills on the afternoon of 9/1/64 and
at about 3:00 p.m., ROSSELLI was playing cards. Later in the
afternoon, ROSSELLI remarked that he was 56 years old and that
old age was creeping up on him. ROSSELLI also remarked that he
"would like to go back to the chureh" and would "like to make
his peace with his God." Informant and ROSSELLI then talked
about Jews in Italy after ROSSELLI had made some remark
indicating he was anti-semetic in his feelings. During the
conversation, informant asked ROSSELLL, “Wherecare you from?"
