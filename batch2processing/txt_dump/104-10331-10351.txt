Question 2: For other than the 201-289248 file on
Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was opened, the
purpose for the opening of the file, and the documents that
were in the file at the time of the assassination.

Response: As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have been
destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in
chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening
dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826 Opened approximately July 1952
#0090079 ; Opened approximately February 1953
#0093466 Opened approximately July 1953.
#0119144 Opened approximately May 1955. =

3. HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project
involving the opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to
and from the Soviet Union,

 

In the Office of Security this project was known

as SRPOINTER with subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER,
INDIAN, BANJO, and SETTER. The Office of Security actually
conducted the opening and monitoring of mail with the
acquired information being referred to the Directorate of
Operations.

4. The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa
1950 for the purpose of. recording information on US citizens
defecting to other countries and information regarding
foreign nationals considering . defection to the United States.
This file contained information. was from press clippings,
Directorate of Operations. reporting, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Department of State, and the various armed
services. The pre-assassination documents located in this

5. The index reference to the Defectors File
identifies a list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as
the Defector Machine Listing. This listing was a computer

' printout of defectors and provided limited biographic data

on each name. . This listing was maintained separately from
the actual Defectors File; notations within the Defectors
File show the Defector Machine Listing as permanently >

Security. Efforts to locate this listing or determine its
disposition have been unsuccessful.

Listing as being approximately one and one-half inches thick
and in'two parts. One part consisted of an alphabetical
index. of defector names with assigned numbers. The second

‘part listed the assigned numbers in numerical order and

contained the limited biographic data on each name.

7. The subject file pertaining ‘to Lee Harvey Oswald

(#0351164) was established circa 1960. It appears this file

was created as a separate repository for the numerous press

_ clippings and reports received from other government

agencies on the defection of Lee Harvey Oswald to the USSR
and his activities following his return to the United

States. The first volume of this file appears to have been
preserved as the pre-assassination file, and the documents

contained in, ‘this file are as follows:

There is a notation in the Defectors File that a separate
file exists on Oswald.

9. Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of

-Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D.

Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a
majority of them contain a notation or the initials of
Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the
officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing
of this information.

10. The Security Research Staff (SRS) was the
component’ responsible for collecting, developing, and
evaluating information of a counterintelligence nature to
detect and/or prevent penetration of the Agency's 3
organization, employees, and activities by foreign or
domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted
research in connection with employee loyalty cases and
maintained records identifying personalities, environments,
and personal traits of individuals who had been of
counterintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained
liaison with various government agencies in connection with
counterintelligence activities and coordinated the
counterintelligence effort throughout OS. Using
organizational charts of this time period, SRS reported
directly to the office of the Director of Security.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. Pursuant to ARRB “Request No. CIA-16,the Office of
Personnel Security conducted research for and existing pre-
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The following
responses are provided to those questions which pertain to
the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These responses are
the best reasonable answers based on available information.
Please note OPS was known as the Office of Security prior to
1 October 1994. z
Question 1: Please identify, as specifically as
possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time
of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response:. At the time of the assassination, the Office
of Security (OS) held two files which contained information
on Lee Harvey Oswald. One file entitled “Defectors File’
(#0341008), contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, and
the second file was Office of Security subject file on Lee
Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in
the automated security database known as the Management Data
Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted
of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated
system. This hand search produced the same results as the
automated search of MDP/PS..

2. ‘Within the ARRB request is specific mention of an
HTLINGUAL. file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official
files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file),
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144: All of
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. The search
of Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any
of these files. Attached is all of the available
information. regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL -
files. This information was retrieved from the Information

Management Branch/Records Control Section and from a review

of general office administrative files.
