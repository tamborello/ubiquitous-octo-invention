BRINGUIER said he was in Cuba at the time of the
overthrow of the Batista Government by CASTRO and told how
FIDEL CASTRO personally assassinated a relative of BRINGUIER
by shooting him. BRINGUIER, in broken English, spoke about
his leaving Cuba and coming to New Orleans, Louisiana, where
he got into astere business with his brother-in-law. Then
in the middle of 1963, LEE HARVEY OSWALD walked into his
‘place of business and told him he was against FIDEL CASTRO
and was interested in helping CARLOS BRINGUIER train exiled
Cubans in a nearby training camp near New Orleans. BRINGUIER
said he was suspicious of OSWALD already because a few days
before that incident BRINGUIER and his friends had received
information from someone in Mexico who was connected with
Cuban .activities, that there was a spy in the New Grleans
area (pro-CASTRO). He said OSWALD, from his conversation,
already knew about the existence of the secret training camp
for exiled Cubans near New Orleans, where Cubans in exile were
being trained to be returned to Cuba te fight the CASTRO
Government. BRINGUIER stated he felt sure OSWALD was the
CASTRO spy who had been reported to be in the New Orleans area.
He claimed he told OSWALD his only interest inthe organization
known as "Cuban Student Directorate" was for the propaganda
angle and not actually to help train people at the camp; that
BRINGUIER'S associates would not need OSWALD. BRINGUIER
claimed he was suspicions of OSWALD and dd not want his services.
OSWALD then left that store.

. A few days later a friend of BRINGUIER told BRINGUIER
he had seen OSWALD a few blocks away carrying a sign announcing
he was for CASTRO. BRINGUIER went to the Place where OSWALD
was carrying the sign and both recognized each other. He
said OSWALD seemed surprised to see BRINGUIER there. BRINGUIER
added he got mad and called OSWALD a traitor and communist;
whereupon, OSWALD tufned his face to him and told him to go
ahead and “hit him.” BRINGUIER claimed he then realized
OSWALD was trying to be a martyr and wanted BRINGUIER to hit
him in order to gain sympathy. By that time a crowd had
gathered. BRINGUIER claimed he told OSWALD he was through
and might as well leave New Orleans. This occurred in about
August, 1963, according to BRINGUIER.

A few days after the above incident OSWALD sent a
Marine training book to BRINGUI by some other individual
as.a present. He said that inside the coverwas the same
name that reportedly was the“name in which a rifle was
purchased by OSWALD that was used to assassinate President
KENNEDY. That. name was LL (phonetic). BRINGUIER claimed
