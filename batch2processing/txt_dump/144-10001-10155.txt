”.. position to one Of the letters removed from page 152° was con-

. cluded that thig letter had been accidently removed by the cutting
process applied to page 152 and that its removal resulted from the
application of excessive pressure on the cutting tool when the letter
on page 152 was taken out. ;

The sample is considered too small for any valid conclusions to
bs reached as to the purposes for which the above noted letters were
removed. kt is considered most unlikely that this ‘Process of letter
removal has any cryptographic implication.

d. The Russian "Tourist" portable radio was examined for
cryptologic evidence. The radio appears to be a normal receiver and
there was no evidence of its usaé for any other purpose.

e, The names appearing in Lee's and Marina's address
books were checked, No evidence of cryptologic implication was
found.

Although the results of the examination of the materials provided
by the Commigsion are essentially negative, further study ef these
materials will be made. If any results are obtained, the Commission
will be advised, However, it 1s considered most unlikely that any~
thing beyond what is reported above will be discovered.
