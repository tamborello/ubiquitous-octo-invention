On 3/29/61, PG 615-C advised SA FORSYTH that THOMAS was
still somewhere in Florida and undoubtedly will be in
touch with KELLY MANNARINO.

The above is for the information of Miami Office to be
alert for the presence of THOMAS in its division, and Pittsburgh
plans to interview him upon his return to New Kensington.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARNED AND DANGEROUS.
