MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 24 May 1961

SUBJECT: HIDALGO, Balmes Nieves
#65077

1. The FBI liaison men (Mr. Papich and Mr. Kuhrtz)
showed me a memorandum which mentioned that a wife of a
current Agency employee working at the Mariott Motel at
the 14th Street bridge had observed some unusual activity
which possibly involved the Soviet Embassy.

 

2, The memo which was given to Mr. Papich was not
signed and it did not identify the writer of the
memorandum or the name of the Staff employee.

3. Mr. Papich thought that I was the one who had
passed the memo to him. I passed the memo around the
Office of Security and was not able to ascertain who
wrote the letter.

4. On 24 May 1961 C/PSD, Mr. Papich, Mr. Kuhrtz and
I ate lunch at the motel and after lunch Mr. Papich and I
talked to the gift shop manager and from her learned the
names of her employees. One of the names was Subject's
name.

5. The name rang a bell with us and I suggested to
Mr. Papich that WH/4 people gave him the memorandum.
Subject's fil ubject is with the project
and works fo Papich then felt that
it might have been r Joe Langan who passed
the memorandum to him nts office.

6. Subject an Lee on leave until Monday.
Either one will call me on Monday.
