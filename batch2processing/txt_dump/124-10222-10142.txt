JURE, the ER, and the "Alliance" were planning to enter Cuba to, “~
prepare the groundwork for internal insurrection, while the MRR
was to carry.out diversionary hit-and-run attacks on the Cuban \
coasts. Meanwhile, the FORC was building up its own clandestine,
organization among the’ workers in Cuba; its aim is to organize \
sabotage and ow-downs in Cuban industries, thus paving the way
for an even general strike. FORC claims to have the support
of the Confederacion de Trabajadores Venezolanos (CTY, Venezuelan |
Workers’ Co ow ae on), and of the Confederacion Lat americana
