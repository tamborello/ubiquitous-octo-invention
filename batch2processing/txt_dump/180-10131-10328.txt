1 as the Chief of CIA Operations based with his headquarters in

2 Washington, visited Mexico City, spoke to the Station Chief in

 

3 Mexico, recommended that I be changed to the new job.

4 Mr. Sprague. And who was that?

 

5 .Mr. Phillips. His name was Desmond FitzGerald, the

6 |. Chief of Station was Win Scott.

 

7 Mr. Sprague. And would you explain what the nature of th
g || new assignment was which, as I take it, then had -- you then
9 had for the remainder of your tour in Mexico.
10 Mr. Phillips. It was to know what the Cubans were doing
in Mexico City, specifically in their embassy, to try to
12 obtain as much information as possible about their intentions

13 in Mexico and Latin America, specifically, to know what was

 

14 going on in and around the Cuban Embassy.

; Mr. Sprague. Now, where was the Cuban embassy located?

16 | Mr. Phillips. I believe I recall the name of the street
> as Calle Insurgantes, which was several blocks off of the

1g | Main street in Mexico City.

19 | Mr. Sprague. And what was its proximity to the Russian

20 embassy?

Mr. Phillips. Rather close.

Mr. Sprague. When you say rather close, what do you meanP
Mr. Phillips. A few blocks, as I recall, though not

24 | Many.

 

Mr. Sprague. Now,when you were put in charge of the

2 Mr. Phillips. In the normal chain of command itwould havd

5 Mr. Sprague. Who was the Chief of Station?
6 Mr. Phillips. Winston Scott.
7 Mr. Sprague. And who was the Deputy Chief who ought to

8 have been the head man over you?
9 Mr. Phillips. When I was there, there was a man named

10 | and I believe he was still there at the time of

Oswald's visit.

on the Cuban operation, was it and who were

2 Mr. Phillips. They did not, sir.

 

3 Mr. Sprague. Now, how long did you remain with this kind

 

4 of duty that you have just described?

5 Mr. Phillips. Roughly two years, until about mid-1973.

6 Mr. Sprague. ‘'63. . .

7 Mr. Phillips. I'm sorry, sir, '63.

8 Mr. Sprague. When you say approximately mid-1963, to the

9 best of your recollection, what months are you. talking about?
10 Mr. Phillips. I believe it was July or August. I'm

Ww not absolutely positive about that.

 

12 Mr. Sprague. Now, at that time you were given a different
e 13 assignment?

Mexico?

Mr. Phillips. The assignment was in September of
1961. I arrived in September or early August, as I recall.

Mr. Sprague. And how long did you remain on assignment
with the CIA in Mexico?

Mr. Phillips. Until early 1965.

Mr. Sprague. Now, commencing with your assignment in
1961 by the CIA to Mexico, what were your initial duties?

Mr. Phillips. During the first part of that four years,
roughly; my job was that which involves propaganda and that
sort of business. .

Mr. Sprague. Could you explain what you mean by that?

Mr. Phillips. Mexico City has * the Cuban embassy there
which was active during the 1960s in attempting to assist
Fidel Castro in exporting his ideas of revolution in Latin
America, and it was the U.S. Government's policy and CIA's

practice to counter that when they could. That was largely

 

the extent of that.
| Mr. Sprague. When you say counter that, what were the
nature of the things that you did to counter it?

Mr. Phillips. By arranging, assisting journalists, for
instance, to write the right kind of things about the United
States, supporting groups who were in effect groups which
might -- which were anti-Castro.

Mr. Sprague. Did any of that support involve those

PROCEEDINGS

Mr. Preyer. The Subcommittee on the Kennedy Assassination
of the House Select Committee on Assassinations will come to
order.

Congressman Thone and myself, Congressman Preyer, we have
a quorum that satisfies the rules to take testimony.

This session will be an executive session; it will be a
closed session. The Chair notes that Mr. Thone disagrees with

executive sessions in principle and the court respects his

 

opinions on those. Chairman Downing, however, has requested -
that this be a closed. session, and therefore the Chair
declares this session closed.

The purpose of this session is to receive the testimony
of Mr. David Phillips, and Mr. Sprague, if there are no other
preliminary matters, I will swear the Witness at this time.

Mr. Sprague. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Preyer. Mr. Phillips, would you put your left hand
on the Bible and raise your right hand.

Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to
give before the House Select Committee on Assassinations will
be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?

Mr.. Phillips. I do.

Mr. Preyer. Thank you, sir.

If you will have your seat, and Mr. Sprague, I will turn
