It is further noted that PH 672-C-TE should be
a drawing ecard to the luncheonette and it is anticipated that
this luncheonette will become a meeting place in the
. neighborhood. ANGELO BRUNO's place of business is less than
200 yards from this location.

 

Philadelphia, accordingly, requests that authoriza-
tion for microphone coverage at both 900 and 902 South 8th
Street be reconsidered. Time is of the essence in this
matter.

. It is requested that the Laboratory, provided
authorization is granted by the Bureau, immediately forward
to the Philadelphia Division a Minnimite suitable for
penetrating a wall. In addition, a Minnimite that would
be secreted in the housing of a public telephone which is
to be installed in the rear roam of 900 South 8th Street,
where the luncheonette will be located. It is felt
that these types of installations will afford security and

} will not be available for inspection by unauthorized
telephone personnel.

. It is noted that the Minnimite or other
microphones suggested by the Laboratory will be in an area
where voice volumes will fluctuate; consequently, it is
requested that equipment be provided, if available, that
| has an automatic volume control,

. Re Philadelphia airtel 5/28/64 in captioned matter
and Bureau letter to Philadelphia dated 6/2/64,

Re Philadelphia communications proposed that two
Special Agents, whose identities would be unknown to
PH 672-C-TE, render assistance to this informant in preparation
for opening a luncheonette at 900 South 8th Street, Philadelphia,
: Pa. -It was proposed that these agents, under previously
a explained pretext, could, with complete security, install
microphone coverage at both 900 and 902 South 8th Street,
Philadelphia.

It is pointed out that there would be no security
problems involved in this endeavor, There would be no
compromise of the Bureau's confidential techniques. Re Phila-
delphia communications pointed out that if any breach of
security developed, the installation would not be made.

The installation would be made by the two sound
men whose identities would not be known to the informant.
The informant, with the assistance of ANGELO BRUNO, Commission
member and head of Philadelphia family of LaCosa Nostra, is
employed as a truck driver working from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily,
I~ Accordingly, he would ne, ke present while coverage was

being effected. SY abe

In addition, accompanying FD142 re coverage
proposed at,900 South 8th Street, under item #9, pointed out
that both FRANK MONTE and FRANK NARDUCCI, both known members
of LaCosa Nostra, have promised source that they would
frequent this luncheonette if he was successful in opening
same, It was also pointed out that this luncheonette is
in the area most frequented by LaCosa Nostra members and
it would be the only luncheonette in this area where the
proprietor himself is a member of LaCosa Nostra.

It should not be overlooked that this source would
be extremely valuable in checking on the veracity of the
confidential informant involved.

It is believed that these reasons would indicate
that coverage of 900 South 8th Street has a high potential.

In addition, it is pointed out that coverage at
902 South 8th Street has extremely high potential inasmuch
as it} 1s a known and established fact that ANGELO BRUNO
uses this location almost on a daily basis to hold meetings.

It is explained that the informant will not have
knowledge of the fact that microphone coverage will be
utilized in either 900 or 902 South 8th Street. His employ-
ment is such that he will not be present. He will not know
the identities of the agents with whomlfe is dealing.

Philadelphia has deliberately developed this
situation, telling the informant that it would be advantageaus
for him to have the luncheonette to show as a legitimate
income, considering that he is on probation in both Phila-
delphia and Montgomery Counties, Pa. He has been advised
that the contacting agent would help him make preparations
for opening the luncheonette by obtaining the services of
individuals,who have not been identified to the informant,
in painting and making other necessary preparations for opening
the luncheonette,.

It has been considered that 902 South 8th Street,
Philadelphia, would be the most advantageous position to
obtain microphone coverage known to this divisien, inasmuch
as ANGELO BRUNO meets his criminal associates at this location
on a daily basis. _
