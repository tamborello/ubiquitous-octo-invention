Title: JOHN F. KENNEDY RECORDS COLLECTION
ACT OF 1992 (THE ACT)

Synopsis: Search negative for any additional information related
to President John F. Kennedy’s assassination.

Details: On 06/03/1998, a search of the Columbia Division's
indices for any additional assassination-related information,
@ based on the names cited in HQ EC dated 05/29/1998, was negative.

The only references located were for previously
requested searches as set out in HQ airtel to All FBI Field
Offices dated 01/23/1998 (COfile 190-0-239) and one previously
reported reference--a four-page “FBI FOIPA Preprocessed List
compiled as of 11/22/1983,” COfile 190-0-161).

No old “archived” .SAC material was located for
assassination-related material. (It should be noted the Columbia

Division was not.opened until December 1965, and it is,
therefore, unlikely any such material would be found in this

Division.)
