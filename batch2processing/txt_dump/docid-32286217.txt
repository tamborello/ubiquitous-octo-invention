This ‘article also reported that Dr. HIGGINS during
. 10/62, was reappointed by Chairman ROBERT KENNEDY as a
special advisor to the President's Commission on Juvenile
Delinquency and Youth Crime for another year's term. ;

It appears from the above information that Dr. HIGGINS
will be leaving the Chicago area in October for approximately
a year and that the above attempts by MARCY to regain
possession of Room 705 is obviously for his own use during the
absence of Dr. HIGGINS. It would appear that should MARCY
regain possession of Room 705 the reactivation of CG 6610-C*
would be an extremely valuable source into the activities of
MARCY and other Chicago hoodlums. In the event MARCY is unable
to obtain Room 705 as indicated, it is possible that MARCY
may be considering using the office of FRANK ESPOSITO which
is next door to Room 705, it being noted that MARCY was recently
in contact with ESPOSITO. This situation will be closely
followed.

The Chicago Office through discreet contacts with
; CG 6283-C and CLARENCE JOHNSON, Building Manager who has been
. contacted confidentially in the past, will attempt to make
available Room 705 for the lst Ward Organization so that the
\ Chicago Division would be in an excellent position to afford
confidential coverage in this regard.

office space except Room 705. JOHNSON told MARCY that there
