OPINION THAT THE BOOK RAIDED WAS JUST ANOTHER HANDBOOK AND THAT IT DID
NOT HAVE ANY PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE. HIS OFFICERS RECOVERED SOME EVI-

 

DENCE WHTH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE Us S» COAST GUARD FROM THE CHICAGO
RIVER AND HE IS MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO MAKE THIS EVIDENCE AVAILABLE

TO THIS OFFICE FOR PERUSAL. LT. RIORDAN INDICATED THAT INASMUCH AS HE
OBTAINED THE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE WIREROOM ONLY THROUGH A QUOTE
FLUKE UNQUOTE AND SINCE THEY RECOVERED NO INFORMATION WHICH COULD BE
USED AS A BASIS FOR UNCOVERING OTHER HANDBOOKS OR FOR CONNECTING ANY
PEOPLE WITH THIS PARTICUALAR HANDBOOK, HE DOES NOT INTEND TO CAUSE ANY
FURTHER INVESTIGATION OR RAIDS ON HANDBOOKS IN THE AREA CONTROLLED BY
BRIATTA FOR ALEX. IT CAN THEREFORE BE SAID THAT THE CONCERN BY CG SIX
TWO. SEVEN TWO DASH C AND HANDBOOK OPERATORS IN: THE FIRST WARD FOR FUTURE
ARRESTS IS NOT BASED ON PROBABILITY. THAT SUCH ARRESTS WILL BE FORTH-
COMING OR THAT THE CHICAGO PD IS CLOSE TO CLEARING UP GAMBLING OPER-
ATIONS IN THE FIRST WARD. ARMED AND DANGEROUS WITH SUICIDAL TENDENCIES.
