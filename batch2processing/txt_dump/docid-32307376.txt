stolen merchandise that comes to his attention and will do
practically anything to make a dollar. He stated the premises
that Ross's Drive-In is located on is owned by JOE CIVELLO and
he is confident that since PETE INTERRANTE did not have any
funds for which to do business, that CIVELLO undoubtedly put .
up the funds for this business. He stated that he feels he
also has an underworld con act with CIVELLO and:sikee his
association with CIVELLO/has appeared to come into considerable
amounts of money. He recalled that Ross's Drive-In had !

JOSEPHINE (last name unknown) however, she recently had the
registration of the property changed to JOSEPHINE INTERRANTE,

relation for a two week period a few years ago.for the purpose
of going into business and getting a beer license, however ,

he later learned INTERRANTE has a long criminal record and that
the City would not authorize the issuance of a beer license to’
PETE INTERRANTE. Thereafter the partnership was disbanded. He
stated he feels that if INTERRANTE's background is brought to. the
attention of local authorities the beer license for that property
will be repealed,

T-24 recalled the name which he had previously forgotten.

as the man in the telephone company in Dallas who is closely
associated with the Italian criminal element. He said the man's
