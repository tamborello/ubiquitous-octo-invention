Pittsburgh, which means that gamblers in Squirrel Hill are.
transported from that section to New Kensington for the pur-
pose of gambling. Routine employees at the gambling casino
receive $150 per week flat, and those in charge receive the
$150 weekly salary plus a small percentage of the net take.
It has been curious in the past to note that whenever they so
desire, KELLY. MANNARINO or SAM MANNARINO would walk into the
gambling casino and demand that. the cashler give them a sum
of money. For instance, SAM MANNARINO might tell the cashier
to give him $1,000 and not to tell KELLY MANNARINO at the
risk of being killed. Employees at the casino do not carry —
weapons generally, butmi:occasions, when there is a rumor that
the casino may be robbed, everybody,- including the MANNARINOS ,
goes about town fully armed. .

Prostitution and Narcotics

Neither KELLY nor SAM MANNARINO has ever been known to_ trartic

in narcotics or to operate prostitution,

Hideouts ;

During the long period of time, in excess of one year, that
KELLY MANNARINO was hiding to avoid service of subpoenas,
commencing in December of 1957, he Stayed ar two places: :
the house of "SARGE" BOTTI, in Wilmerding, © Pa,, and the house
of FRANK D, "SONNY" AMATO, the brother-in-law of KELLY “
MANNARINO, who !:.residas.:: in East McKeesport, Pa. -

 

| During.. the period in 1958 when SAM: MANNARINO was. avoiding:
service of subpoena, he stayed, at least part of the time,
at the parish house of Mount Saint’ Peters Roman Catholic

Church, ‘New Kensington, Pa. oo.

F. POLICE PROTECTION AND POLITICAL TIES.

New ‘Kensington, Pa., Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK and the ‘ma jority
of his City Council have been "owned" by the MANNARINOs, since’
their election approximately eight years ago. At one time,
JOE MEROLA,’ at the instructions of KELLY MANNARINO, "wired"
the New Kensington City Council chambers, so that tape:
recordings of the proceedings could be made .

GEORGE FLOREA and RICHARD STEWART, with help from a "inside .

‘he had bought some burlap bags and the weapons, when found,
had been wrapped in burlap bags, actually had nothing to do
with the case,. ANDY MANGINI, who was never brought into ‘the

beer distributorship to the truck and fromthe truck to. ‘the

“. gun-running

‘Although the Federal Government was not able to prove it, |.
there is no question that SAMUEL’ MANNARINO was part of. the. -
conspiracy in 1958 to run guns from New Kensington, Pa..,°.to
Cuba. . - : Lo

Originally -the plans to take guns to Cuba were JOSEPH MEROLA'S
plans and the guns were scheduled to go to FIDEL CASTRO, In.
the summer of 1958, AL ROSS told MEROLA that he, could obtain .
M21 rifles and carbines, ‘MEROLA met ROSS at the Warwick Hotel, |
New York City, and gave ROSS: $4,000 as part payment for the
guns, which money MEROLA had. received from CARLOS PRIO...
MEROLA was to return to the Warwick Hotel’ with“additional
money in a day or. So and did so, but AL ROSS did not show up.
“After MEROLA returned to Miami, Florida, MEROLA learned -from
Dr, LOUTS PESSOLANO, Miami Springs, Florida, that SAM MANNARINO
was: interested in purchasing an Apache airplane. Because. .
MEROLA is a pilot and acquainted with bee teenie he looked
over the prospective plane with Dr, LOUIS. PESSGLANO and -—
advised Dr. PESSOLANO that the airplane was too.defective.
After that, MEROLA assisted Dr. PESSOLANO to lease a Twin
Beech airplane from a company owned by HAL DUPONT, Miami, ©
Florida. When Dr. PESSOLANO told MEROLA: that MANNARINO intended
to'use the airplane to fly guns to Cuban dictator BATISTA, he .
realized that these were the guns that had been promised to
_him and that he. was peing dovble-crossed.- MEROLA then abpranged
with Dr. PESSOLANO for MEROLA to accompany the pilot, STUART
-SUEOR, on the first flight to Pittsburgh, for the sole purpose
of contacting SAM MANNARINO and asking him about the. double-
cross. After SUTOR and MEROLA landed at Allegeny Airport,
Pittsburgh, they took a cab to MEROLA's sister's house ‘in the -
Regent Square section of Pittsburgh and borrowed her car.”
‘They drove to.the Tour-Tel Motel on U. S. Route 22, Monroeville,
where they registered for the night. MEROLA and SUTOR ‘then
traveled to New. Kensington, where -MEROLA. attempted to locate
SAM MANNARINO. MEROLA was unable to locate SAM MANNARINO, so -
he went to Wilmerding, Pa., to the house of "Sarge" BOTTI,
where KELLY MANNARINO was hiding from the service of subpoenas.
KELLY MANNARINO stated that he knew nothing of the plan to
smuggle guns to Cuba, that this was one of SAM ;MANNARINO'S
“hare-brained" schemes, and that he wanted nothing to do with
it. MEROLA then returned to Miami, Florida, by way of Eastern
Airlines, It was not until the pilot, STUART SUTOR, was

member of the "outfit," by birth ‘or “py being "made ” “ whether
one. is born into eligibility for admission into the: "outfit"
or one is made eligible, the only way one can become finally
accepted is-by~the commission of a-murder. Every man:who is
considered a "don} without exception, has at some time or
‘another killed someone. Once a man becomes a "don," the onl
way he can cease being such and can leave the. "outPit": is by
his death. The expression is used that “the door opens only
one way." . :

In approximately the middle 1950's, KELLY MANNARINO took a
great liking to JOSEPH. MEROLA and on several occasions told
friends that he "was making" MEROLA into a "don." On one
occasin, KELLY MANNARINO took MEROLA to New York City with
. nim where he introduced MEROLA to VITO. GENOVESE. and MIKE
‘MIRANDA, ‘at which time KELLY told them he was making MEROLA
-sinto a "don." On another occasion, KELLY MANNARINO gave’
MEROLA a pakage and told him to deliver it to New York City
‘without opening it, and when JOE MEROLA had delivered. the
package in New York City and it was opened, it was found to
“ . contain only cut up newspaper. MEROLA was put to other tests,
such as arrests by the New Kensington, Pa., Police Department
all of which were designed to test him to see if he. could be
trusted and would remain silent. Because of this experience
with KELLY MANNARINO, MEROLA became aware that all.of the top
leaders, both Nationally and locally, of racketeering | ae of
Italian extraction and are known to each other as "dons,

Some of the “dons" in the Pittsburgh, Pav; area are:

NORMAN--ROTHMAN has represented the MANNARINOsS in their Cuban
and some Florida interests for many. years. ROTHMAN, like all
other MANNARINO employees, steals from them, and when the

- MANNARINOs have lost money in an investment, such as the Sans
Souci Gambling Casino, Havana, Cuba, which ROTHMAN fronted for
them, ROTHMAN always emerges with money.. ROTHMAN's Cuban
connections are over-rated and when anything actually difficult
is to be accomplished in Cuba, ROTHMAN ordinarily needs the
assistance of JOSEPHMEROLA. Currently, ROTHMAN ‘has the
franchise for the cocktail bar in the Bel. Aire Hotel, Miami f¢

_ Beach, Florida,. and his two sens are working at the bar. ROTH-
‘MAN is, like SAM MANNARINO, an addict to cocaine, which he :

Although AL ROSS has the reputation & ae of having killed
on many occasions, it is not believed th t he deserves: that
reputation, He has never been known to brag about any kill-
ings. ROSS, who is under order of deportation to his native
Russia,: is worried that the U. S. Government will find some
nation which will accept him. ROSS is very much in love with
his wife, MORMA, who is a nymphomaniac currently residing on
Palm Island, Miami Beach, Florida. ROSS gives the appearance
of being a "tired old man, " and he shows no enthusiasm for
taking part in any illegal activity to obtain money, even.
though he is in serious financial straits. ;

JOHN. CHRISTOPHER FONTANA

. JOHN FONTANA was once KELLY MANNARINO's bodyguard. and most _
trusted lieutenant. KELLY MANNARINO regarded FONTANA as his
protege and made hima "don." After FONTANA's marriage ahout
a year. and a half ago, he and MANNARINO had a falling out,
FONTANA thought that he was not getting enough money and
complained to MANNARINO, who told him that he was getting all
he was going to get. FONTANA then made the serious mistake
of going over KHLY MANNARINO's head and appealing to JOHN ~
-LA ROCCA, who subsequently reported this to KELLY MANNARINO,
Since then FONTANA has been relegated to an unimportant, job
fronting the Marbet Heating Company store in New Kensington,
and he receives little or no income from the MANNARINO gaming
activities.

It is noted that MEROLA was interviewed by Pittsburgh’. _..;

’ SAS. JOHN S, PORTELLA and THOMAS G,. FORSYTH III in Miami at
the request of MEROLA, made to Departmental Attorneys
WILLIAM KENNY and WILLIAM KEHOE. .

Prior to the commencement of the interview on B/N /6l, Dr
Attorneys KENNY and KEHOE spent approximately ten minutes
alone with MEROLA, after which SAs PORTELLA and :- FORSYTH
were called into KENNY's office, Room 201, Federal Building,
Miami. Before the beginning ‘of the interview, DJ KENNY
advised SAs PORTELLA and FORSYTH that MEROLA-had set the
conditions that the Departmental Attorneys be present;

that he would never testify to any information: furnished;
that he requested his identity be protected so that none of
his information ever could be traced back to him;and that

On August 14, 1961, and on August’ 15, 1961, JOSEPH RAYMOND
MEROLA, . 2018° North Bay Road, Miami Beach, Florida, was inter-
viewed at Room 201, Federal. Building, Miami, Florida, by

SA JOHN S. PORTELLA and SA.THOMAS G, FORSYTH III in the
presence of U. S. Department of Justice. Attorneys WILLIAM
KENNY and WILLIAM KEHOE, who were there at the insistence

of MEROLA. At the outset, MEROLA stated he would never testify
to any of the information furnished, and he desired his
identity be protected, MEROLA advised as follows:

A. PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND
Name Change

No information has ever been received why the MANNARINO fenily
name was legally changed from RUGGIERO to MANNARINO.

Marriage of GABRIEL MANNARINO

GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO's wife, JEAN, had no choice in her a
selection of mate. The marriage was arranged between her
father, FRANK AMATO, of Braddock, Pa., and KELLY MANNARINO,

JOSEPH PETER MANNARINO, aka, JOJO - Brother

JOJO MANNARINO, who suffers from a palsy-like twitching and
from severe stammering, is a "nut" and "con man." He has
dissipated the fortune of his wife, HAZEL, widow of motion
picture actor LEWIS STONE, in just a few years. KELLY and
SAM MANNARINO allow JOJO to come to New Kensington’ occasionally
on the conditbn that he "stays out of trouble," but JOJO always
- does something to get into trouble, such as writing worthless
checks, and is forced to leave town. After such visits to
‘New Kensington, KELLY and/or SAM MANNARINO ordinarily make
good the amount of the worthless checks written by JOJO.
