information, such as where the thing would be located and what
type of buildings, etc., would be constructed, so that he can
submit the necessary information for consideration.

SALLY BURNS also requested that the source look into

The source told JIMMY HOFFA that ANGELO DI RITO had gotte
$15,000 on the MINTZER loan (La Guawlia Motel loan). DI SPIRITO
allegedly gave this money to his father and received a savings
account check for most of the money to pay DANNY MAHER by check.
The source stated that he called ANGELO DI SPIRITO and told him
that he was going to. report the males that he gave him on his
income tax return. He stated he had no alternative and was not
going to take a chance because he did not trust MINTZER. The
source stated that he was reporting all the "green" that he had |
given to DI SPIRITO, even though it did not pertain to the MINTZER
deal. The source stated that he thought it was only $17,500, but
from a recent check, it was $26,000. The source stated, however,
. that he only reported $17,500.

Re: DAVID WENGER a x

The source stated that DAVID WENGER has asked for
more "green". However, JACK CARTHY does not want the source
to give DAVE WENGER any more money until he finishes up the
Fairlawn Memorial Hospital and the bowling alley on 108th Street.
MC CARTHY said to hold back on him a little bit or he will not
finish these loans. wae DE FEQ also is against giving WENGER
any "green" at this time because they have not completed the |
~ Forum Motor Lodge deal and WENGER has held this one up himself.
PETE DE FEO said, however, to offer him some money to keep him
interested. The source said that he did, however, WENGER said
he would let the source know what he wants. PETE DE FEO said that
he would deduct the points that were allege going to WENGER for
HOFFA which is allegedly going to go to JQ Nacwhich time
the source believes that it will be very clear whether/fSt WENGER
is holding out on HOFFA. The reasoning behind this is that he
‘does not believe WENGER would lie to PETE DE FEO. The purpose
‘of this is that they will, be able to embarrass WENGER and apparently
show that he has been holding out, if not all at least in part,

He told source "you don't know how crazy this whole
i thing is. You don't know who Dorfman's contact is. This guy
“is the judge. The one before the Grand Jury who subpoenaed
Clinton down. -He hates Clinton and since he subpoenaed Clinton
» down, he has met Alan Dorfman in a hotel room when Dorfman gave .
him a room number. It was the same time Jimmy (HOFFA) was in
Chicago. It's all very recent. Jimmy came down from his room
(at the same hotel) and met with the judge. The judge said
‘first of all, this is just a fishing expedition. They are not
going to fish in my court’ and I'll give them a hard time'".
. PUL
(Source advised that this is the same judge who recently.
ordered STANFORDXCLINTON ,“atforney_for_the Teamsters} to testify
before the Grand Jury, claiming that this was a fiduciary relation-
ship rather than a lawyer-client relationship. Source stated
that there was some publicity concernig this matter in the Chicago
| Bpers, but WENGER told him that CLINTON's testimony was unimportant.
since the same testimony had previously been given to the Grand
Jury by WENGER and MURTHA. a

 

WENGER said that the only reason the judge forced
CLINTON to testify is because there is a long-standing
antagonism existing between CLINTON and the judge, but WENGER
also said that the judge told HOFFA that as far as JIMMY, HOFFA
was concerned he would do what he can. He thinks this is just a
' Shame what they are doing to him (HOFFA). The judge apparently
told HOFFA they are pushing him (the judge) and the government
is being ridiculous. He also allegedly told HOFFA they are
really on a fishing expedition and wasting the Grand Jury's time.

Source further advised that the meeting between the
Federal judge and HOFFA, according to WENGER, took place the
last time that HOFFA was.in Chicago. WENGER also told the source
that last week ALAN DORFMAN was extremely worried. He told WENGER
that he probably should not’ ‘have arranged the meeting, but he.
wanted JIMMY (HOFFA) to hear for himself what was being said - °
because he (DORFMAN) did not know whether HOFFA would believe him.
