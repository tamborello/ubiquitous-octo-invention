MM 62-4956

FCUM was in no way affiliated with the Traurig
Insurance Agency and to knowledge, FCUM sold insurance
to companies, such as shrimp boat companies, who were
unable to secure insurance through American Insurance
Companies. FCUM, through his son LEONARD, would contact
foreign insurance companies, names unknown, who would
underwrite any policy sold by FCUM.

-

Any business dealings that FCUM or his son,
LEONARD, may have had are unknown to him. LEONARD is.
presently employed by the AOU, 1221 North La Salle St.,
Chicago, I1l., and he maintains a residence at 350
Oakdale Street, Apartment 1403, Chicago, Ill.

He does not know where the books and records
of FCUM might be retained but feels that LEONARD would
know the location of such records.

 

Chicago locate and interview LEONARD TRAURIG,
owner and operator of the Florida Caribbean Underwriters
of Miami, in accordance with lead and instructions set
forth for Miami in referenced Bureau airtel.

For the information of the Bureau, prior to «
contacting any established:.sources in Nassau, Bahamas,
concerning JOHN KEARNEY and Intercontinental Insurance
and Surety Company, Miami, will hold this lead in abeyance
until such time as the outstanding investigation in the
San Antonio and Chicago Offices is completed relative to
this phase of the investigation. It is felt that Miami
should have as complete details of facts as possible re
this matter prior to any inquiry in Nassau.
