Memo on RIDDERSTRALE

 

Ridderstrale was questioned on September 9th 1964 and :
gavethe following information.

He has never visited countries outside Europe and the
statement attributed to him that during a period of seven
years he should have lived in Cuba is not true. He believe
that somebody who wanted to harm him had ascribed these
words to him. Neither is it true that he has visited Haiti.
He admitted that on several occasions he has discussed
politics and in the course of these discussions he has
spoken of Swedish communism as well as.of the Fidel Castro
government in Cuba, and he did not deny that he had spoken
of revolutions in Venezuela and Mexico supoorted by Castro.
He pointed out, however, that what he had said in this
respect was only what could be found in Swedish newspapers.
Somebody who had listened to him might have misunderstood
hin.

When questioned whether he had used the expression: "I
tell you, Kennedy will probably be shot", he denied that.
He could not explain such en expression since he could not
remember having said anything like it. He knew nothing
whatever beforehand about the murder of the President.
