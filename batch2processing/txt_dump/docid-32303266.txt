Report of Special Agent Joseph 7. Haters

dated February, 9,. 1948, at New York,

New York. oa

<

Report of Special Agent Albert F. Chestone
dated November 25, 1950, at Hew York,
New York.

Report of Special Agent Wilbert H. Kehe
dated Lecember 16, 1953, at San Francisco,
California.

It is observed that as of Uctober, 1953, Pittman
was employed as Foreign Editor for the "Daily Worker” and
"The Worker,” having been so employed since April 24, 1951.
He was previously Associate Editor of the “Datly Worker" and
"Phe Forker." file reportedly attended a meeting in Europe in £53
1946 with William 4. Foster and French Communist leaders.
An alleged Comintern representative also reportedly attended
this meeting.) Pittman attended the 1950 convention of the
Communist Party held in December, 1950, at New York City and ;
he was elected to the convention's Press Committee. In. . .
September, 1951, Pittman covered the San Francisco Japanese
Peace Treaty Conference for the "Daily Worker” and the
"Daily People's World." He has been an instructor for the
Jefferson School of Social Science since 1949 and has written
for the publications “People's Voice," "Jewish Life,” and
"Masses and Mainstream." He has been a speaker at Communist
Party meetings.

 

In view of Pittman's close Communist affiliations
over a period of years and his present employment with the
"Daily Worker," there appears to be no reason to believe he
would be cooperative. An interview with hin at this time is
not contemplated.
