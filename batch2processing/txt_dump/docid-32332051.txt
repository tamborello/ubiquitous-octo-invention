Generalissimo RAFAEL TRUJILLO of the Dominican Republic.
It is to be noted that WILLIAM ALEXANDER MORGAN is an
American soldier of fortune who fought against BATISTA

8/8 and 8/14/59, MORGAN was the leading figure in a
“double-cross" of anti-CASTRO Cubans and Dominicans who

his cooperation in establishing an armed front against
CASTRO in Cuba. MORGAN is in Cuba.

offered to put MASFERRER and JAFFE in touch with his
"organization" for the purpose of providing financial
assistance to MASFERRER in overthrowing the CASTRO
government in return for substantial business subsidies
and franchises should MASFERRER succeed. ROTHMAN indi-
cated that his "organization" controls millions of dollars
and has established business firms. It appears that
ROTHMAN undoubtedly had reference to the MANNARINO gang. yy

PSI JAFFE has been instructed to attempt to
obtain all additional information possible concerning the
above developments pertaining to ROTHMAN. C4
