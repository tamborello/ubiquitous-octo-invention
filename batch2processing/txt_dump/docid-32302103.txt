‘FLEITES..emphasized that the group is not. asking for
arms, money or transportation. He-claimed-they- have. the men,
arms--and the .means.to attack and overthrow CASTRO. © He-stated
the*SNFE would not use..any part of the United: States--from
which to launch its.attack but as soon as they occupy a ter-
ritory large-enough to be. recognized as-a-de facto Government
or as-a Government..in.arms-the-SNFE would like-to be assured.
that the--United States would..recognize its members as such

a. governing body and give them support of a moral and economic
nature. Ku) 7 . ;

FLEITES claimed-it would be relatively easy
to tumble: FIDEL CASTRO from.power-.as- the Cuban. people:
are now.fully fed up with him. He said the-big problem would
be.-controlling radical elements-.and re-establishing law and
order after CASTRO is overthrown. He assured. that his group
would not be fighting in a-spirit of vengeance but from a
desire liberate Cuba from its oppressive Communist dictator-

ship. | ur)

ked regarding the-nature of the ‘Government

“he proposed to set up in Cuba, FLEITES stated it would

certainly be Democratic, and that free. enterprise: would
be recognized--and encouraged. MM T-1. stated as-an indica-
tion of the talkative nature of. FLEITES or possibly.as an
indication of the kind of Government. he has in mind,
FLEITES stated:

"For the moment, we are-not considering
nationalizing any of the firms, industries,

or privately owned - ‘property in Cuba". Niu /

. _FLEITES concluded: ‘that. an. exact date: for starting
the action against: CASTRO has--not been set. .He’ said his-
group would like “to submit .progress-reports: through Mr.
ROOSEVELT in order to keep the-President of the- United. States
fully informed of the-progress-being made by his group
toward acquiring ability to launch an attack. and sustain it
long enough to accomplish the above-stated -purposes. He
stated the group can be contacted through RICHARD VERANES,
