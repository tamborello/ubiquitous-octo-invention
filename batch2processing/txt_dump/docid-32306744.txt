told him CHARLIS NYGOSIA had an important job with a
powerful chicago politician.

Informant advised that to his knowledge neither
JOE nor CHARLES NICOSIA were LON members at that time, |

formation regarding ALDERISIO's recent meeting with
PRAPPICANTE but assumes one reason could be ROSELLI's
agreeable attitude to take control ef Los Angeles LCN family \
away from LIGATA and Detroit influence.
