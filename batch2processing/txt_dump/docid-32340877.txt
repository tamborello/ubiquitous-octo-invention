An analysis of the above_information reflects
several obvious factual conflicts Dr. RIVAS VASQUEZ
advised in March, 1977, that one of the DISIP sources
had reported two meetings in the Dominican Republic in
June, 1976. A larger one, which was a political meeting,
and the smaller one, which was strictly operational, whose
purpose was to decide on terrorist activity against Cuba.

Among those present at the operat al meeting, hows (S
to the source, was GUILLERMO NOVO. pai 1337-S, who was )
also in attendance at the June, 1976, meeting, advised

that the meetings were held in the Dominican Republic

on June 11, 12, and 13, 1976, and that the representatives
from the Cuban Nationalist Movement were Dr. JUAN PULIDO

and JOSE DIONISIO SUAREZ, not GUILLERMO NOVO. Moreover,

MM 1337-S presented the conference more as one continuous
than as two separate meetings, but did advise that the
conference contained discussions of future terrorist

activities. Oh)

BOSCH, through BLAKE FLEETWOOD, confirmed that
the meeting had taken place in June of 1976 in the Dominican
Republic and had been attended by all of the military and
political directors of the different Cuban exile groups.
BOSCH also confirmed through the FLEETWOOD article that
CORU had been formed at that meeting, and that he himself
was the leader. (U)

[Jin his statements confirmed that the OTHER 1c
meeting had taken place and stated t it was only one of
the CORU meetings held in June, toro fgurther,
advising that his information came throug SIP agent Csi OTHER 1¢
LUIS POSADA, stated that JOSE SUAREZ, not GUILLERMO NOVO,

had been r sentative from the Cuban Nationalist
Movement. RE)

As can be seen from the above, several distinct
references were made to two meetings in the Dominican
Republic in June of 1976. They can either be interpreted
as two meetings at the same three-day conference or as a
continuous meeting over a period of several days, which
obviously involved more than one physical encounter of
attendees, which would thereby explain the apparent
conflict. This in fact was the original interpretation 4
by the 00 as regards to the above point inasmuch--as MM-133 TES™-
reported the presence of SUAREZ at the June, 1976, meeting} 7
and this was corroborated by another source.’ e 00 was
therefore persuaded to believe that in fact SUAREZ did .
attend the meeting, and that the information provided pyf S|

1977 Edition of New Times Magazine Article
Entitled, "I Am Going to Declare War" By
BLAKE FLEETWOOD.

FLEETWOOD's article is a result of a four-hour
interview of ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA, who was at the time of the
interview incarcerated in Caracas, Venezuela, for his role
in the October, 1976, bombing by anti-CASTRO exiles of a
Cubana airliner plane, which cost the lives of some 73
people. The interview contained the following information //

regarding the June, 1976, meet\ng in the Dominican Republic
by anti-CASTRO Cuban exiles b

BOSCH's plotting culminated in a secret meeting of
the top terrorist leaders of the hemisphere in the Dominican
Republic. "The story of CORU (Coordination of the United
Revolutionary Organizations) is true," he told me. "There
was a meeting in the Bonao mountains of 20 men representing
all different (Cuban exile) activist organizations. It was a
meeting of all the military and political directors with
revolutionary implications. It was a great meeting.
Everything was planned there." (

The top men from Alpha 66 (New Jersey), Abdalah
(a New York-based youth group),. the 2506 Brigade (veterans
of the Bay 6f Pigs invasion), FLNC, F14 (New York City)
and Accion Cubana (a group BOSCH headed) met for two days
in the Bonao mountains in early June, 1976. They decided
to band together under an umbrella organization, CQR with
BOSCH as the only identified spokesman and Teader [d,

"At last we had all the Cuban revolutionary
fighters and leaders together after 17 years. We decided
to upscale the action after that. We wanted to beat the
guy (CASTRO) or at least make his life impossible. I told
them that we couldn't just keep bombing an embassy here and
a police station there. We had to start taking more serious
actions--hijacking." (According to a Cuban exile newspaper,
one of the resolutions that came out of that meeting. was a vow
“to begin attacking CASTRO's planes in the air.")

"I accepted the leadership of CORU because I wanted
to set everything up on an organized basis. We were tired
of being frustrated and not accomplishing everything that we
wanted to do." BOSCH brought the other leaders up-to-date
on the kind of help they could expect in Nicaragua, the
Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Chile. Then the group
dispersed. In the 11 months since that meeting, BOSCH
boasts, CORU has been responsible for over 50 bombings in
Miami, New York, Venezuela, Panama, Mexico, and Argentina.
(BOSCH refused to admit any personal involvement in bombings
within the United States; police sources say the leaders
had agreed not to take credit for actions within the.U.s.
because the FBI was putting too much heat on them. ) | )

BOSCH then spoke of two countries which are not
friends of FIDEL CASTRO's Cuba. These are Chile and Costa

io AUSA EUGENE M. PROPPER é
ec - 3-"On March 9, 1977-; Dr. RAFAEL..RIVAS. VASQUEZ,

Deputy. Direetor> DISIP, advised that in Jene, 1976, two
meetings were held in the Dominican Republic which were
attended by leaders of the principal Cuban exile organizations.
They had two meetings, the first one, and the larger of the
two, was a political meeting to agree on a political strategy
for the various exile Cuban groups. The other one, a much
smaller meeting, was strictly operational and was attended

by 6 people. Itsspurpose was to decide on terrorist activity
against Cuba. DISIP léarned from a source that the following
people attended the operational meeting: ORLANDO BOSCH,
GUILLERMO NOVO, LUIS POSADA, an unidentified representative
of the Brigade 2506, FRANK CASTRO and ARMANDO LOPEX ESTRADA.
PROPPER volunteered that one of his sources identified
ROBERTO CARBALLO, present Head of ‘the Brigade 2506, as its
representative at the meeting. “Aecording to RIVAS, a map

was marked up during the meeting, showing the various
divisions of responsibility. For example, POSADA's group

was assigned all of South America and the Caribbean was a
target of opportunity for all groups. Mr. PROPRER asked

who had..been assigned North America. RIVAS said he did not

‘know, but -that he hada copy of the-map.. PROPPER asked for

a copy. of--the—map~and-REVAS agreed fo furnish it. PROPPER™
explained that he speculated that North America may have

been divided in two by a horizontal line, running across

the U.S. at the level of Washington, D.C. If so, the
territory north of the line may have been assigned to the NOVO
brothers, who worked primarily out of New Jersey (although

one of them, IGNACIO, actually lives in Florida); the Brigade
pe 6: (RSS ve been assigned North America south of Washington,

.. Subsequent to that meeting, said -RIVAS, POSADA's
group had carried out a number of operatt#ons. These were:
bombing of the Air Panama office in Bogota (carried out by
LUIS OPOSADA, HERNAN RICARDO and OLEG GUETON RODRIGUEZ) ;
bombing of the Cuban office in Panama (RICARDO and cuztox) {$)
