Dear Dr. Rhoads:

The Select Committee is investigating certain matters
relating to the assassination of President Kennedy. In
connection with this investigation, the Committee would
like to have two members of its staff, Mr. James Johnston
and Mr. Dan Dwyer, review material in the Lyndon B. Johnson
Library in Austin, Texas. Both individuals have Top
Secret/Compartmented security clearances.

The Select Committee requests these two staff members
be given access to relevant material at the Library. I
suggest they contact Mr. Middleton directly to discuss what
material they wish to review. If they determine that the
Committee should have a copy of any of the materials, Mr.
Johnston will arrange for this at a later time.

.

Sineerely, y,

William G. Miller

Mr. William G. Miller
Senate Select Committee

Dear Mr. Miller:

I have your letter of April 13, 1976 indicating a plan to send two
members of the committee staff, Mr. James Johngon and Mr. Dan Dwyer,
to the Lyndon B. Johnson Library to undertake research in certain

matters relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. —

Your staff members should contact Mr. Charles Corkran, Assistant Director
of the Lyndon B. Johnson Library, to discuss in more specific terms

the quantities and subject relevance of materials in the Library

and any further specific requirements for gaining access. I presume

that some of these materials are already open for research while

others remain closed because of security classification or donor restriction.
Your staff members may have access to the classified materials, but we
will require further coordination before permitting classified materials
to be copied and released to the committee. If materials subject to donor
restrictions are encountered among materials to which you seek access,
your staff will be unable to use the materials unless those restrictions
can be waived.

Sincerely,

JBR

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Subject: Coordination with National Security Council staff concerning
reference service to the Senate Select Committee

After both letters from William G. Miller of the Senate Select Committee

staff had been received and Charles Corkran had estimated the quantities

of classified records that might be examined under this research request,
I made further efforts to contact Mr. John Matheny for White House clear-
ande to grant access to the Senate Select Committee researcher, Mr. James
Johnston.

Matheny referred the question to Jeanne Davis of the NSC staff who appar-
ently asked Steve Skancke to make contact with me. In describing the
problem to Steve Skancke I stated that the research request involved
three topics: (1) the assassination of JFK, (2) assassination attempts
on Castro, and (3) assassination plots on other foreign leaders. I
stated to Skancke that clearly the third subject was too vague to respond
to. With respect to the first two subjects, I reported, the materials
that would be made available to the researcher amount to 20,800 pages or
3,500 documents. Of this total we estimate that approximately 40 percent
are classified and these include materials from State, DOD, CIA, FBI,
Secret Service, NSC, and other White House originated. Therefore, I said,
we are talking in the neighborhood of 1,800 classified documents.

Steve asked me what were the ground rules. I stated that in earlier
requests of this kind coordinated with James Wilderotter we had granted
access to the committee staff researchers and had then filtered any
requested copies of classified documents through this office to Wilderotter
for review before presentation to the committee. Skancke stated that such
a procedure is acceptable under the current request. He further stated
that should the researcher attempt access to materials beyond these two
topics the NSC staff would like to be consulted before access is granted.
On this basis I responded to Skancke that I would proceed to contact both
the Johnson Library and Mr. Johnston to go forward with the research.

Dear Dr. Rhoads:

Mr. Johnston of the Committee's staff has talked with Mr.
Corkran at the Lyndon B. Johnson library in Austin, Texas, re-
garding the material Mr. Johnston would like to review, Mr.
Corkran suggested that we provide you with a more specific de-
scription of the material to assist you in obtaining White
House clearance for our access,

As Mr, Johnston told Mr. Corkran, he is interested in re-
viewing records relating to contact between the intelligence
agencies, especially CIA and FBI, and the White House concern-
ing President Kennedy's assassination or Cuban matters between
November 22, 1963, and January 31, 1964. In addition, he wishes .
to review records relating to contact between the CIA and FBI
and the White House concerning Cuban matters, the assassination
of President Kennedy, or assassination plots against foreign
leaders between February 1 and May 31, 1967.

We appreciate your assistance in this matter and desire to
obtain access to this material as soon as the necessary arrange-
ments can be made.

Sincerely,

WbhanteMll,

William G. Miller
