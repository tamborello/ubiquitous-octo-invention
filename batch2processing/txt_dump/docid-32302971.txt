It is further known that both HARBER ena[kovareyfPoax
Spanish, and it is possible that this common language
ability was the basis of their association, even though
there is no evidence at [the Soviet {took a course at
the Berlitz School. QR 5

n any event, the association between subject
and [KOVALEV was discontinued in early 1959 and it is felt{ S
that’ there is little likelihood of it being renewed in th
immediate future.{ KOVALEVJis currently (in the Soviet Union C $_}
on home leave,\and although he is expectéd to return to this
country in ch, 1960, it is possible that he may not ree
turn at all. He was finvolved in the double agent operation Cs)
petween Soviet VADI » KIRILYUK and BS. 789-Sj and as 6 re-
sult of this operation, and based on a reque by the WS. 4
State Department, the Secretary General of the United Nations C$
requested and obtained[KIRILY UK "s} resignation from the(UeN.C DY
Secretariat «| (5)

In view of the foregoing, NY feels that HARBER
does not constitute a threat to the security of this country
at this time and this case is being placed in a closed status.
No consideration is being given to requesting permission to
interview subject in view of his past history of mental ill-
ness. It is believed that such interview might well result
in embarrassment to the Bureau uowever, should any informa-
tion come to the attention of this office indicating that
HARBER has renewed his contacts/{with KOVALEV and/or any other
Soviets,/ this case will be promptly re-opened and additionel s)
investigation will be conductedo

A copy of this letter is being furnished to

ly resides within the territory covered by that office.
