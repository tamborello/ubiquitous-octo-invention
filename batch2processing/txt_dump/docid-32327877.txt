ADMINISTRATIVE:

Based on information furnished by NY )336-C-TE
_to the effect that SALVATORE GRANELLO has never forgiven
THOMAS EBOLI for authorizing the "hit" on GRANELLO's son,
MICHAEL, in 1968, who was reputedly dealing in narcotics,
‘GRANELLO has been opened as a PC of this office. GRANELLO
has been openly stating that EBOLI should have shown him
the respect of at least consulting, him prior to authorizing
the "hit".

 

The NYO anticipates interviewing GRANELLO to
determine his potential as a C-TE. The Bureau has been
advised that any interview with GRANELLO should not jeopardize
the pending WPPDA cases under which GRANELLO is a subject. |
The AUSA in the SDNY who is handling these cases has been : |

- contacted and stated he has no objection to GRANELLO being !
contacted along theplines as long as the interview is limited
and does not concern the pending substantive violations.

NY T-2 refered to in the details of this report
is SEYMOUR SISKIND who has been contacted by Buagents and-
who is under development as an informant. He has displayed
a cooperative attitude and it is felt that he is in an
“excellent position to furnish information regarding GRANELLO's
activities. .

Information copies of this report are being designated
for MM and SJ in view of their interest in this case and since
additional investigation might be requested in those Divisions.
