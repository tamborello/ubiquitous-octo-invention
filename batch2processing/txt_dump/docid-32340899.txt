Association in Miami. ROSADO and GONZALEZ are not friends

and are on different sides politically speaking, GONZALEZ
being "more liberal". ROSADO was in contact with him in Miami
in connection with Cuban exile activities until late 1969,

Los Angeles, not long after the assassination.of TORRIENTE in
Miami, threatening a dozen or so local Cubans. "“EZEQUIEL" was.
