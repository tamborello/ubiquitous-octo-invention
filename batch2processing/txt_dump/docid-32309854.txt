RE: EJERCITO CUBANO ANTICOMUNISTA

we On April 4, 1963, Fiorini reportedly claimed that .
” -~". he had been in radio contact with the above-mentioned uniden-
tified boat, and it was tied up at an island in the Bahamas,
ee “exact location of which was not disclosed. The boat was re-
ee portedly camouflaged and heard the U. S. Coast Guard planes
Oe flying above in an effort to locate it. Fiorini claimed he
could supply this unidentified boat with fuel and food, if
. requested by this boat, and that he had available an Aero-
' Commander airplane in Miami and two fast powerboats laqcated.
somewhere north of Miami. It was not known what manner of
tone -radio communication ,was used by. Fiorini to contact the un-':
oO identified boat. Wie . ;

On April 4, 1963, local newspaper, radio, stations
and television stations in Miami, Florida, reported that the
oo "Violyn IIL" had departed from Nassau and was enroute to
- “Miami with a U. S. Coast Guard escort. Miami Attorney Charles © |
oe _R. Ashmann made press announcements that the crew of the "Vio-
lyn: Tr" would not return to the United States.

In the early morning hours of Aprii 5, 1963, MM T-3
advised that Ashmann. claimed the "Violyn III" would rendez- :
vous with the other unidentified and would complete its an

_ infiltration mission to Cuba. wie}

on April 5, 1963, MM T-4, a representative of another
- Government agency, advised ,that on the afternoon of April 4,
. 1963, the "Violyn III" left Nassau, Bahamas, on a general course
‘for the United States, and at that date was at the north tip of)

RE: EJERCITO CUBANO ANTICOMUNISTA

 

 

Andros Island in the Bahamas. Because the "Violyn III"

was in shallow water, the U. S. Coast Guard discontinued re
its surveillance of the "Violyn III" by boat, and the sur- ~
-veillance was taken over by U. S. Coast Guard aircraft. : ‘
At about 8:20 P.M., the "Violyn IIL" turned off its running
lights and had not been seen by the Coast Guard since that

time. : .

MM T-4 reported that there is a Sigma-type Cuban
fishing boat which was stopped near Williams Key off the
coast of Andrews Island on April 5, 1963. MM T-4 said this
' Sigma boat was possibly the boat that was supposed to rendez- —
vous with the "Violynn IIL" for an infiltration mission in--
to Cuba, There is an airplane landing strip at Williams Key-..
which could not be used because someone had placed a great -
‘quantity of rocks and driftwood on the runway.

On April 5, 1963, Mr. Chester A. Woish, Chief, od
Investigations Branch, Immigration and Naturalization Service, |
Miami, advised that the "Violyn III" had just arrived at. the: !
‘seawall, Key Biscayne, Miami. The Cubans aboard were tobe

taken by INS authorities to INS detention facility at Opa
Locka, Florida, where interviews were to be conducted, and =
‘any United States citizens on board were to be taken by INS- “
- authorities to INS Headquarters in Miami, where these indi- .
viduals would be interviewed for any possible violations of
