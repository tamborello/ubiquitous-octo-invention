JOHNSON was unknown to him and since the New Orleans Office
does not yet know the extent to which Governor, JOHNSON
and/or Harrison County, Miss., Sheriff. EDWARD DONNELL
will enforce local and State laws in Harrison County. In

this regard, it is noted that Sheriff EDWARD MC DONNELL,

has continued to allow RICHARD KNOX HEAD, aka "Dick" Head,

New Orleans top hoodlum in New Orleans file 92-51, Bufile 92-2795,
to operate the Sa-When Lounge on West Beach, Biloxi, Miss.,
despite assertions before taking office that HEAD would be

among "the first to go" when MC DONNELL took office 1/6/64.

 
  
  
    

NO 1225-C, Gulfport, Miss., an informant of

known reliability who continues to furnish information
i concerning criminal activities on the Mississippi Gulf
Coast, furnished information 2/7/64 indicating that
HEAD very probably cooperated with known hoodlums, DONALD
; LESTER JAMES, aka Jimmy James, and DELBERT O'NEAL, aka |
‘ "Little Governor" in plans for "steering a mark".to JAMES
' and O'NEAL at the Broadwater Beach Hotel, Biloxi, Miss.,
: over the weekend 2/8-9/64 for a rigged crap game. The
: possibility exists, therefore, that dissemination to Sheriff
MC DONNELL on matters concerning HEAD and his associates. ..
: might conceivable result in compromisi rees. Similarly,
NO 1225-C advised on 2/10/64 that_DE | a member

   

the present time, due to the fact that former Governor
ROSS R. BARNETT had made an excessive number of pardons
fT or releases. JOHNSON reportedly told BROADUS to contact
N him in about 90 days, at which time he, JOHNSON, would

: arrange for ROBERSON's release. Informant was not

aware of the consideration JOHNSON expected in return.
