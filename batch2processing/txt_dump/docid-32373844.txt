commented that assassination presented the only real prospect
for bringing sbout an early change in the Cuban situation.

: CHIBAS commented further that even ean assassination progres

Any hope for the eventuel resumption of « democratic
regime in Cuba lies, not in any anticipeted or immediate take-
over by opposition forces, but in the posaible disagreement,
éisorgenization, and fight fer control that might result enong
the remaining leaders from the lose of Fidel Castro.

Cextainly those Cubans who have gained through the changes
brought about by the Castro revolution would continue to sup=

Lf by some fluke such an assassination attempt should be
succeseful, the only opposition group in any position at
esent to take advantage of wresting control from the Com-
ratste ie the right-wing movement ferming under PRIO. This
groups' plans reportedly include use of a re-activated BATISTA

probably result in en early renewal of civil war and an even-
tual return to power of the Comaumnists.
