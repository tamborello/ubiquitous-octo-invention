"MINUTEMEN” At, 8

Reference is made to St. Louis memorandum February 17,
1965, concerning "Minutemen",

On February 23, 1965, a source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that Roy DePung had

Station Wagon in which there were parts of a gun. Source
stated that he observed the stock, trigger, trigger guard, and
a magazine,which, according to DePung, will hold thirty shelis.
The barrel of the gun was not observed and DePung commented that
he does not carry this because to do so might constitute a
violation of law.

DePung went on to say that he had recently tried
out six machine guns in southeastern Missouri and evidently
this was done to insure that they were in operating condition.
Thereafter, apparently over the weekend of February 13-14, 1965,
Edward Arthur of Columbus, Ohio, came to St, Louis and got the
machine guns. DePung stated he would not give Arthur the weapon
in his station wagon. He then went on to say it is a .30 caliber
weapon and can either be fired automatic or semi-automatic.

DePung made no comments as to the purpose for which
Arthur acquired the weapons, nor where ke may have transported

known as Americans for Freedom. He was further described as
