Memorandum from John A. Hartingh to William E. Baugh, Jr., dated
7/28/95
Re: JFK TASK FORCE

DETAILS: On or about 7/31/95, the FBI will be formally advised
by the ARRB that they are ordering release of 10 FBI documents
(copies attached) containing five informant symbol numbers and
information, a true name potential criminal informant (PCI)
elieved deceased, and information from the Swiss Federal Police.

These are the first 10 FBI documents reviewed by the
ARRB. They were transferred to the National Archives pursuant to
the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992
(GFKARCA). All relate to the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald,
and/or Jack Ruby; and the information at issue was "postponed"
(redacted) from public disclosure to protect FBI informants,
foreign government cooperation and foreign relations.
Traditional justifications, similar to those used in FOIPA
litigation, were submitted to the ARRB to justify these
"nostponements". The information to be ordered released is
summarized as follows, by document number:

1. Dallas (DL) 44-1639-32 - The identity of true name
former (PCI) Carl A. "Pappy" Dolsen, (deceased) addressee, and
137- file number.

 

2. HO 44-24016-329 (DL 44-1639-299) - informant symbol
number for Houston (HO) 1125-C and identity of conversant, as
singular information tending to identify informant.

3. HQ 100-12583-473; and,

4. Cincinnati (CI) 105-2505-45 - Informant symbol
numbers CI 291-S, 104-S, and 300-S; some information (not related
to the assassination) tending to identify the informants and two
pertinent "137 " file numbers.

5. Mexico City (MX) 105-3702-10 - informant symbol
number MEX-118 and corresponding file number 134-325A, both
currently classified; identifying the fact we operated sources in
Mexico in 1963 which could impact foreign relations.

6. HO 105-82555-8
