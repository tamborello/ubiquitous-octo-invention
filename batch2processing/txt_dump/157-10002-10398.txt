The report also says, here, "none of this other
activity would seem to warrant Castro's associating
that activity with U.S, leaders to the extent that he
would threaten the safety of American leaders aiding
the plans.'' We note without exception.

Footnote *, The Cuban Coordinating Committee was
a group for coordinating implementation of established
programs. By memorandum of 22 May 1963,. McGeorge.

- Bundy, Special Assistant to President Kennedy for

National Security Affairs, designated the State Depart-
ment Coordinator of Cuban Affairs as Chairman of the
Interdepartmental Committee on Cuba with the specific
responsibility for the coordination of day-to-day actions
regarding Cuba. Membership of the Committee con-
sisted of representatives from State, USIA, DoD, CIA,
Justice, Treasury and ad hoc representatives as
necessary.

Footnote **. This seems to indicate that the FBI
learned! of CIA's operations on 10 October 1963

“(anew date? ) and that this led to termination of the

AMLASH operation. Of course, that happened much
later.

"Special Affairs Staff"! should read "Special Activities
Staff." ; .

SASICI should read SAS/CI.

Testimony of Karamessines is quoted, in which he is
asked a hypothetical question about use of AMLASH,

and that he answered hypothetically, but the presentation
seems to treat it as fact.

Reference to cial eottection capability in -
Mexico City should be deleted. Simply delete the \
word This small point is a sources-
and-methods question. :

to a generic description of anti-Castro groups.
Persons identified with them in some circles could
suffer from official confirmation of the connection.
This is still considered as classified. It is‘noted
that CIA did not have an operational interest in
SNFE or Alpha 66,

Page 129, That the SAS Executive Officer views the AMLASH
_ operation as having been an assassination plot is
not very helpful, unless the time sequence and
evolution of the relationship with AMLASH/1 is
made a part of that view. His account in 1967
supported FitzGerald's story of what happened
es : in the 29 October 1963 meeting.

That SAS/CI speaks broadly may not be all that
helpful either, if the extent of his knowledge,
and when he knew what he says he knew, is
‘fixed in time. That he wrote a memorandum in
1965 on the security of the operation, does not

_ qualify him to address where things stood in

1963. In fact, he is quoted at page 139 as saying
that he could not recall the time frame.

Page 133. The draft report states that in October 1963 the
FBI knew of the "assassination aspect of the
AMLASH" operation. As is noted éarlier,
thére was no such characterization that applied
‘to it then, so how it could have known is subject
to question.

Page 161. The 1967 IG report did not consider the issue of when
ee _ the operational relationship with AMLASH/1 developed
to the point where AMLASH/1 could feel he had CIA
support for his plans. It simply dealt with events as
they unfolded. The report was used as a primary
source for the brief capsulized summary of the AMLASH
operation that preceded this detailed series of comments.

General. It is requested that reference to cables follow the general
practice employed in the SSC report on alleged assassination
plots. The date the cable was sent, the quoted portion, an and
the country of origin should suffice t

3 This technique for treating cables permits:
the basic story to be told without providing unnecessary and
harmful, from a security point of view, inforrmtion.
Instances in the draft presenting the question were noted
at pages 41, 46, 49, and 57. In addition, although JMWAVE
' has already been identified officially in SSC published reports,
> the basic treatment of communications cited in relation to
that Station should otherwise receive similar technical
treatment; see pages 19, 19a, 56, 106 and 138.
