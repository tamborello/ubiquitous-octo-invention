During the small talk prior to the arrival of
KONIGSBERG, there was no indication that either JOE or RALPH |
knew HAROLD wanted to ge to Philadelphia. The fact that RALPH
did not know was not considered unusual as he usually operates
on a need-to-know basis with JOE ZICARELLI.

JOE was: annoyed, as always, that HAROLD was late and
thoroughly bawled him out for this along with the’ a
Fat s

was not clean shaven. JGE agreed to take HAROLD and
Philadelphia but told HAROLD that he would have to f

way back because he was not going to wait around for him to
complete all his business after ne completed his business.

En route to Philadelphia in ‘gs white Cadillac, :
JOE and HAROLD rode in the front “alli the rear. They
listened to the VALACHI testimony on the radio and ‘made several :
remarks in jest at the testimony. ; oo

Upon arrival in Philadelphia, the car. was park
apparently near to where JOE and HAROLD wanted to go.
took a cab to HASS' office, and he does not know where
and HAROLD went but believes it is undoubtedly close to where
they parked the car. He could not recall the exact location
where the car was parked but recalls that if you left the’
bullding. where HASS' office is, turned right and traveled |

about two blocks, then turned ‘right again and traveled about
fourteen blocks, that would be* ‘the approximate place the car
was parked. 7 :

 

Prior to their Arrival in Philadelphia, /

Turnpike and told him they would be late for the appointment.

and this. was the first time he had ever met HASS persoridlly

‘although he talked to HASS.many times over the telephone in the

past concerning real estate matters. He told HASS that KONIGSBERG
was a gangster but that HASS would have nothing to fear ar he,
HASS, stuck strictly to the. point and the business at_hand and

did not get off on a tangent of some type with him. [____ ]told
HASS he did not: know what KONIGSBERG wanted his services for.

Around 6: 00 p om, KONIGSBERG arrived and in his usual
overbearing way promptly began te dominate the conversation.
He showed HASS a piece of paper which apparently had to do with
the sale of av’house and demanded HASS. to use every trick he
knew to obtain possession of the house, KONIGSBERG refused to

amazement, HASS knew the owner. of the property. was not

over. ZAVOD apparently did net want to talk about it; and since
HASS apparently kmew ZAVOD, they agreed to meet later and it was
indicated that HASS lived near ZaVOD and they could talk about

it some evening.

KONIGSBERG Admitted to HASS that he was a shylock and
a thief; but in order to convince HASS that he was right in
this matter, he calléd ROBERTS inte the office and told him
to relate’ the real estate trarsaction which involved a Jewish
organization in Philadelphia. ROBERTS did as he was told; but
when ROBERTS began to tell about the arrangements and problems
of financing, KONIGSBERG mide him shut up and chased him out —
of the office. .
