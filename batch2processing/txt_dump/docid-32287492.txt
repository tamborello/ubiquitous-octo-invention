nature that a GEORGE MC GANN, also known as GEORGE MITCHELL,
a Dallas gambler, and a FRED BARNES had been. ‘operating in

indicated that GEORGE MC GANN had “beat some people out of
some money" and had left the Houston area. ;

PCL advised that a "contract was. out" to kill
GEORGE MC GANN, He had also heard that the FBI was
possibly seeking the location of MC. ‘GANN ‘at the present
time, PCI advised that he felt that he could possibly
determine the whereabouts of GEORGE MC. GANN and if the
Bureau was looking for him, it would be necessary to move
swiftly, inasmuch as he felt that this information, although
non-specific in nature, was rather reliable.

_ that GEORGE ALBERT MC GANN, white male, born March 15,

1936, Wichita Fallas, Texas, 5'113", 190 pounds, brown

eyes, brown hair; and FRED F, BARNES, white male, born

April 1, 1927, 6', 175 pounds,’ brown hair, gray eyes,

00 HOUSTON", instant file. PCL was recontacted on 5129/66,
and advised that he would Shdeavor to obtain more specific
information as to who had."put. out the contract" on GEORGE
MC GANN but advised that 1t was doubtful that he would obtain
any specific information for a while, inasmuch as everyone

‘was "very closed mouth" about this contract. PCI was

requested to endeavor to obtain any gambling information of
an interstate nature for the information of the Houston
Office, ~

J On 6/11/88, the Mobile Office advised t
ay Mobile Office’ has maintaineu contact with MO -C-TE,
