In late September 1964 Antonio Carrillo Carreras, Cuban
Ambassador to:-France, made the following comments about
succession to Fidel Casiro Ruz, and the personalities who
are currently the most powerful political figures in Cuba:

a. In the event cf the disappearance of Fidel Castro from ©
the scene, particulariy through assassination, Radi
Castro Ruz will take over inmediately as leader in
accordance with an established plan. Raul has the
support cf tke army as well as that of other top Cuban
jeaders in Fidel's imuediate group.

b. In terms of authority, after Fidel and Raul, President
Osvaldo Dorticds Torrado and Industries Minister Ernesto
"Che" Guevara Serna fcllow in that order. Dorticos, who
is widely respecte’ in Cuba, now has specific responsibility
for guiding the econcmy. Guevara, in spite of ‘his foreign
birtn, has pepular support and is generally considered a
Cuban. Cuevara has ret failed as Minister of Industries,
The difficule Cuncticning of the economy is attributable
simply to the fact, that many key industries continue to
use Arerican equipment for which replacement parts cannot
be acquired. Newer plants generally use Soviet and Czech
equipment ead they are now producing efficiently.
