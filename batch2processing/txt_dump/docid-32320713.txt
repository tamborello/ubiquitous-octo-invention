Mr. David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Assassination Records Review Board
Second Floor

600 E' Street, N.W.

Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. Marwell:

The FBI has reviewed the Assassination Records Review
Board's proposed regulation published in the Federal Register on
February 8, 1995, and styled "Guidance on Interpreting and
Implementing the President John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act
of 1992" (the Act). That review indicated the need for comments
on the regulation to include suggestions for amending the
language of two of its provisions and a request for clarification
of the meaning of the language in a third. The FBI appreciates
the opportunity to provide these comments to be considered by the
Board before it finalizes the language of this interpretive
regulation.

Before making its comments, the FBI wishes to express
its very strong and continuing desire to assist the Board in its
effort to identify all records that relate to the history of the
assassination, to include those that may not have been reviewed
by past presidential commissions and congressional committees
established to investigate the assassination of President
Kennedy. It is indeed through such disclosure of documents that
any questions the public may have regarding President Kennedy's
assassination and the investigation into it can be answered.

: Subsection (a) of Section 1400.2 of the proposed
regulation provides that additional records and information which
the Board believes are required for it to fulfill its functions
