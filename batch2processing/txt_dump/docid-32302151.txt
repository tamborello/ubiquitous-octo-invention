MM %.2 gtated that some of the high officials
of the Rebel Army who formerly took turns in accompanying
FIDEL CASTRO on his trips throughout the country and
in the capitol itself, look 4 unfavorably upon the preference
which the head of the Cuban Government now appears to place.
in these three persons, especially HART and LEANUSA, whom “a
they consider to be ridi on the vietor's "band wagon"
without being true Communis their political
ideals are concerned, Phis jealor not reached such. .

MM T-2 stated that during part of the time when
FIDEL CASTRO was attempting to overthrow the government
of FULGENCXIO BATISTA, ROLANDO CUBE! and FAURE CHOMON
resided together in Miamt. They were intimate friends
and both are widely reported by Cubans, including. Cuban
physicians, to be effeminate and sexual perverts. FAURE
CHOMON was an early Am gador of Guba to the Soviet Union. .
He was then 4 Minister of Communit eations, and now a Minister
of Transportation and also a oe of the Central Committee

  

   
   

of the Cuban commen est Party. MMM T-~2 atated that it could
well be that his sociation ana close friendship with

. of the Cuban Communist Party, editorialized on the stripping

of rank and position of Major EPIGENIO AMETJEIRAS.
AMELSEIRAS was a long-time friend of FIDEL CASTRO and the
Cuban revolution and was the first Chief of the Cuban
National Revolutionary Police. He was removed in sbout
1961 and given various assignments, including a trip to
Europe. which was intended to bring about his better
understanding of Communism and indoctrination with the
same. His nickname in Spanish is “Ie Yerbite” (“The
Little Herb"), which is @ nickhame stemming from his
notoriety as a marijuana smoker. MM T-1 called attention
to the fact that all of AMEIUZIRAS!' vices have been known
te the police long before CASTRO'sa advent to power, but
it is only now that his vices, corruptness, and misconduct
form sufficient reason for nis removal from all positions ~
of authority. ‘ :

The editorial in “G@ranxa" stated that this action
was due te his irresponsible conduct and the great harm
he was doing to his own prestige and that of the revolution
by maintaining friendly relations with “anti-social elements,
vagabonds, and corrupt individuais". It was then noted that
AMEIJETRAS had nad a close friendship and association with

‘former Major ROLANDO CUBELAS, mentioned above as under

trial for plotting to kill FIDEL CASTRO and overthrow the
government. The article stated that the conduct cf
AMELJEIRAS was incompatible with the rank of Major in the
Rebel Army, Vice Minister of the Armed Forces,"and above
all, with that of being a member of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party to which-he was elected in .
recognition of his cutstanding war record, his terrible
suffering in which he lost three brothers in the struggle,
and with the hope that he would make 2 maximum effort to

- overcome his defects”,
