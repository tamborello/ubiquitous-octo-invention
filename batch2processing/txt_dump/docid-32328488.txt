of the Miami area, When MM 635-S introduced “Ui K -to
DIAZ L. , the latter told CABRERA that his name was
GARCIA. L (rhe CIA source knew DIAZ LANZ as PEDRO GARCIA.
CIA, in its memorandum of 11/4/64, stated that CIA ladw..
been able to identify GARCIA as.MARCOS JOSE DIAZ LANZ.)

 

   
  

DIAZ, in the presence of MM 635-S, told CABRERA
he could supply weapons and CABRERA expressed interest in
making a sizeable purchase, indicating that he wanted to
furnish them to some political followers of former
Venezuelan President PEREZ JIMENEZ, who is now in prison
in Venezuela. Informant said that during this meeting,
DIAZ expressed the opinion that if "LBJ" became President,
the United States would go communist and he remarked that
there existed some secret organizations, such as the
"Minutemen," who would fight to the end and that in his
opinion, there could be a military coup. DIAZ mentioned
some place, not in Florida, where the "Minutemen" are
reportedly organized. At no time, however, did DIAZ state '
that he is a member of the "Minutemen" or that he had sold —
arms to them. Also, DIAZ did not say that the "Minutemen"
plan an armed insurrection against the United States Govern-
ment. ‘He Claimed, however, that his brother, PEDRO, had
some connections with groups of this sort but did not
Specifically mention the "Minutemen." Also, he did not
claim the existence of any "Minutemen" military camps in
Florida. ch

MM 7-1 [was of the opinion that DIAZ probably had
Subsequent meetings with CABRERA but informant do not
know what, if anything, transpired during these meetings U

On November 3, 1964, Mr. JOE VIDAL, CIA/liaison!
Miami, telephonically inquired concerning background infor-~-
mation on MM 635-S, under his true name, and requested
identity of the Cuban who had been arrested with him in
the mid-1950's, Since it was known that MARCOS DIAZ, LANZ :
had been arrested with informant during that period,’ CIA
was furnished with the name of MARCOS DIAZ and back-
ground information on informant, without d sclosing his
relationship with this office. It therefore appears that
CIA's source is undoubtedly EFRAIN LORENZO CABRERA, who is
known to this office but not regarded as being completely
reliable. He has been contacted concerning FALN activities
in Venezuela. He is a former chauffeur and bodyguard to
PEREZ JIMENEZ when the latter was exiled in Miami th

BONE SECRET

On November 5, 1964, Miami contacted RAY DUBOIS,
CIA, Covert, Miami, in order to interview CIA source pursuant -
to Bureau instructions. DUBOIS felt that interview of their
source by the FBI at this time would compromise that source
relative to another facet of importanté to CIA, Miami. He
indicated that this additional facet rélated to an arms
transaction involving Venezuela. This office did hot insist
upon interviewing their source in view of the vulnerable
position of MM 635-S, it being noted that only three indi-
viduals were present during the first conference between
MARCOS DIAZ, CABRERA and Miami informant. Mr. DUBOIS agreed
when the suggestion was made that interview of MARCOS DIAZ
by the FBI based upon the newspaper article mentioned in the

enclosed letterhead memorandum would not jeopardize CIA
