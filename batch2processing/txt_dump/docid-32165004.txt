Dear Mr. Innes:

This has reference to your memorandum dated May
28, 1964, re: Lee Harvey OSWALD, your reference 163-364.

26 Wolodymyr NEMYLIWSKYJ, 71 Elm Grove Avenue,

Toronto, Ontario has come to the attention of this Force

on previous occasions. NEMYLIWSKYJ, also known as ;

NEMYLIWSKY, has been the author of several letters to -

this Force between 1956 and 1964. He is a self-styled

detective and undercover investigator. Upon receipt of

his first letter NEMYLIWSKYJ was visited by one of our

members at his residence and was found to be mentally

disturbed and suffering from a persecution complex. “

3 It is felt that any undertaking to have NEMYLIWSKYJ

interviewed along the lines of your memorandum would prove

fruitless and would only serve in provoking his mental dis-
aa turbance further.

° . .
4e To support our views, quoted hereunder are excerpts
from letters written to our Force by NEMYLIWSKYJ:

"I wish to inform you that I was subscribed
my foremans the "Ottawa Anti-Communist Report" at
the Stedman Bros. Ltd, 136 Portland St., Tor. 3
(X-mas present). Mr. Pat Walsh, G.S., sent the
foreman a letter to join the Communist Party in

Toronto, This letter was falseficated with my “
: N undersighning. on it. Stupid foreman told me that,
xX
CL7 oO and he told that to his close friends and to my ;
_W cousin, whom I brought to Canada and have finded
Ko 6 him the job at this same company, where I am

_b
aT working now. '

My cousin was alarmed me, "told me stupid"
(he has 4 years of the Public School, and I have |
2 years of the Husbandry Institute), and want to :
“ pick me out the room, and is troubling me about
von that. Very bad situation! Could you train better
Pat. Walsh? He has no full experience!!! Why did
he send this letter?

If you don't fix this anarchy I will report
everything to Cndn Parliament & Government in
Ottawa.

Wr

Please forget for trouble you again. Tremaine y———_
