ROTI: - : PAT it's just what CHARLIE FITZGERALD told me
and I related it to you and I. don't know if you
related it to them people. He used to sit down
with my father and say BRUNO, all I gotta do

is go sit on Rush Street or I can send a guy
into the LeBistro. -They could sit next to
MARSHALL and a couple of Jews. We find out
every (obs). thing we wanta know! He says you
people, he says, the only reason I'm telling

ya this is because you're a friend of mine. He
says but those other guys (obs) those guys!

He says they. got the biggest mouths in town. .

MARCI: Did he ever tell ya anything about me?

 

ROTI: Never ones, I swear to God did he ever, say anything
. bad about you. But don't put it off PaT, may
be that's where JOHN made his mistake by putting
it off. . .
MARCI: Any: contract that JOHN ever got from them,
. you know I handled it for him,

ROTI: ‘I remember I was with my old man one time ‘when
: he went to.JOE and he says what are you trying
: to give us down there and JOE says whata ya .
| a '. mean, And I thought we were gonna get thrown

| ros out the window. And the old man says where did
: you get that (obs) grease ball. And my old man
went on to tell him and JOE says well my God
‘we got rid of one (obs) and now we got another.-
And then my old man says what are you fooling
1. . around with these old men for and he went on

it to tell JOE about the young talent like you

yo - : and JOHN and JOE says well whata you know about
: : it. And my old man says I wouldn*t mention ~
anything if I didn't know about it. And JOE
says well we'll see and then pretty soon you
guys were in.

It is obvious from the above conversation tht MARCI
and ROTI again discussed the change wherein State Senator
; _DE TOLVE is to. replace D’ARCO as Alderman of the First Ward.
The reference to DE TOLVE's reputation is to the fact that
he is not considered. to be particularly intelligent or
aggressive. CG 6498-PC, another leading West Side politician,
yo “has advised in the past that he is a fairly close associate

constantly the brunt of practical joking by the PCI and other
high-level Italian politicians, Although no recent questions
have been directed to this PCI concerning DE TOLVE due to the

. sensitive nature of this source he has previously advised .

: that it is his opinion that FRED ROTI is the logical person::

to succeed in the event such a change would ever be contemplated.
He very seriously doubts that DE TOLVE would ever be considered
as a successor to D'ARCO for the reason that he is personally
unpossessive of leadership qualities and that he does not :
possess the characteristics which would build anyone's confidence
in him. The PCI also doubts any future for DE TOLVE due to the
fact that he is a nephew of GIANCANA,. ‘

i of DE TOLVE but considers him a very naive individual who is

i . . MARCI's remark concerning the G guys and his conversation
‘ with one is again to the fact that he was interviewed for the
third time by SAs WILLIAM F, ROEMER and MARSHALL E. RUTLAND
in the chambers of the City Council this week. His recital
of that interview is basically factual, although he was very
. courteous and friendly to the Agents. ;

: ROTI’s reference to my father, my old man, and BRUNO
os is a reference to his father, BRUNO ROTI, now deceased. BRUNO
. ROTI was arrested on several occasion in the early 1900's for
\ . Black Hand murders and in those days had the reputation of
i ; being the leader of the "Mafia" in Chicago, It is obvious that
; BRUNO ROTI championed the cause of D*ARCO and MARCI in at least
| . one talk with TONY ACCARDO, who formerly was\ the leader of
| *. organized criminals in Chicago and who is referred to above
as "JOE." CHARLIE FITZGERALD is Lt, CHARLES GERALD..of Dee ,
the Chicago Police Department, who“was former hy~associated
with the old Scotland Yard Unit which investigated organized
| criminals in Chicago.. He is an extremely capable investigator’
and although personally he was not well liked by some. other
of his associates no definite information has been obtained
concerning his integrity. It appears that he may have been
developing BRUNO ROTI and/or FRED ROTI for info ational :value,
His reference to the LeBistro is to a night clubj located just
‘off Rush Street in the night club area of Chicagp, and his
reference to MARSHALL is a reference to MARSHALIYCAIFANO, a .
- fun-loving Chicago top hoodlum. ? yis :

MARCI then re&’eived a telephone call from PHIL |
MESI, a Chicago bookmake and told him that he was going
to the wedding of _MICHAE RIATTA that evening and would talk
to him there, ROTI an “continued their conversation:
