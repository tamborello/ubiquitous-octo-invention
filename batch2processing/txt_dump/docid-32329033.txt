As indicated in relet, information was received
indicating the M.D.C. was believed to be reorganizing in the
WDC area, but based on the above information,it does not appear
it has been successful to date. The national coordinator of
the M.D.C., LAUREANO BATISTA FALLA, recently moved to the WDC
area from Miami, and, although studying for a Ph. D. at a local
university, may take steps to organize the M.D.C. in WDC,

WFO will follow developments in this matter.

In connection with the interview program in progress
in WFO, it is pointed out that 7 individuals, owner of various
businesses in the WDC Metropolitan area, have Jeen interviewed
for the purpose of evaluating their potenti sourngés
informants, Thusfar, one individual,

of the recent arrest in Miami, Florida, of ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA,
MIRR leader, VALERIO CAPOTE MORENO, self identified as WDC’
area delegate of MIRR, applied for the permit and acted as

The sources advised that none of the above groups

events, such as the Grito Commemoration.

 

The various groups were used as sponsors of the
i Grito to generate interest in the event, and to insure a large
‘ turnout. The representatives of the groups are representatives
in name only, since the organizations represented are more or
i less paper organizations.
