"Source advised that several weeks ago he talked
with a fellow prisoner, VERNON BUNDY. VERNON BUNDY, an
Orleans Parish prisoner, testified in District Attorney JAMES
GARRISON's KENNEDY assassination probe that he, BUNDY, saw
CLAY L, SHAW pass money to someone on the New Orleans lakefront,
BUNDY indicated to source he had been offered a deal by District
Attorney GARRISON if he would testify to a story about SHAW,
According to source, this conversation allegedly took place
several weeks ago in New Orleans Parish Prison prior to the
time BUNDY testified at the hearing in Criminal District Court.
At the time of the conversation, BUNDY was undecided what
course of action to take but told source he, BUNDY, would do
anything to get out of his sentence. BUNDY indicated indirectly,
his testimony was not true without stating directly so, or
that a story had been given to him to tell,"
