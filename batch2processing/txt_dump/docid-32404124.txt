< 20 July 1995

Note To: J. Gunn, ARRB staff

Subject: Documents for NARA (i 6 docu menty-ARRKD mete, «/7/98)

1. Enclosed are the declassified “originals” of the 16
documents acted on by the ARRB at the 6/7/95 meeting. We
have stamped the documents “Release In Full” and attached a
revised version (draft) of the NARA identification form. We
still need to update the index and the Oswald HRG retention
boxes that you are holding. Also please send me a copy of
the forms you will be attaching to the documents prior to
sending them to the NARA for our records. I talked with
Steve Tilley, NARA, and he is aware that the documents will
be coming from you for this round.

2. The documents are arranged in the order that they
are listed in the letter from the ARRB to the DCI. Please
give me a call if there are any questions.
