C. The July Overflight Program
. 10. On 10 July, General Taylor, motivated primarily by
the extensive use of aerial reconnaissance in following Chi-
“nese Communist military activities in Fukien, had.asked the
DCI for a comprehensive review of aerial photography activi-
ties, The end-product of this exercise was a series of men-
oranda dated approximately 16 July from the DD/I to the DCI.
The one on Cuba recommended that U-2 flights over Cuba be
continued at their current level of two a month. It cited
inter alia in justification that earlier missions over Cuba
had provided "conclusive evidence that recurring reports of
submarines and missile bases in Cuba have been false," and
that “our most important need is for any evidence of the de-
ployment of SA-2 missiles and/or MIG~21s in Cuba." This
proposal was approved by the Special Group on 19 July and
later by the President. .

ll. The first of the two Cuban U-2 missions authorized ©
for. August was flown on 5 August, probably just too soon to
detect significant reflections of the Soviet équipment enter-
ing the island at that time, The second mission was orig-
inally scheduled for 8 August but cancelled because of weather.
The next day the Special Group gave the DCI discretion to fly
the second August mission "whenever the immediate situation
with regard to Soviet materiel justified it." COMOR reaffirmed
its requirement for the second mission on 13 August. The mis-
sion was again scheduled for the period beginning on the 19th,.
held up.for 9 days by weather and eventually flown on 29 August,

MEMORANDUM FUK? Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT .  : CIA Handling of the Soviet Build-up
in Cuba, 1 July - 16 October 1962

A, The Background 7

1. The USSR's decision to develop Cuba as a military
base must have been made by the Spring of 1962, and prepara-
tions within the USSR must have been under way from that
time on, There also must have been planning activities in|
Cuba, particularly reconnaissance and survey work. The
only indication of these operations which has so far been
found is a Single intercepted personal message on 11 April
to a RusSian in Cuba who had previously been at the
Kapustin Yar missile test range. This fragment was not
judged solid or important enough to warrant inclusion by
itself in current intelligence ‘publications.

2, Thus, until the first evidence of the aeproyniit
began to come in late in July, Washington had no warning

‘of the USSR's intention. Intelligence officers dealing with

Cuba were focussing during July on the direction Soviet-
Cuban relations would take following Soviet acquiescence in
Castro's assertion of his leadership of Cuban Communism in
the “Escalante affair." This attitude was reflected in
reporting on the visit of Raul Castro to-Moscow early in
the month. The President's Intelligence Checklist, which
will normally be used in this memorandum as the record of
CIA reporting to the President, Secretaries of State and
Defense, General Taylor, and MieGe or ge Bundy, reported on

4 July that Raul was “probably seeking more Soviet military
aid and, specifically, more advanced equipment such as the
MIG-21s and surface-to-air missiles which the USSR is
already providing to Indonesia, Egypt, and Iraq." The
Checklist of 19 July, however, noted that Raul had Jeft
Moscow without the usual publicity and.communiqué, and
surmised that this was "ta pretty good sign that the visit
was unproductive." (The Central Intelligence Bulletin,
whenever coordination permitted, carried material generally .
Similar to the content of the Checklist.)

3, The Intelligence Community view of the Cuban problem
in this period was crystallized in NIE 85-2-62, The Situation
and Prospects in Cuba, passed by USIB on. 1 August 1962, as
the intelligence foundation.for MONGOOSE, This estimate
Stated that:

a. "By force of circumstances, the USSR is
becoming ever more deeply committed to preserve
and strengthen the Castro regime. The USSR,
however, has avoided any formal commitment to
protect and defend the regime in all contingencies,"

b. “We believe it unlikely that the Bloc will
provide Cuba with the capability to undertake major
independent military operations overseas. We also
believe it unlikely that the Bloc will station in
Cuba Bloc combat units of any description, at least
for the period of this estimate.” —

ec. "The Soviets...would almost. certainly
never intend to hazard their own safety for Cuba's
sake," but “have Sought to create the impression
that Cuba was under the protection of their missile
power...”

d. “We believe that the Blec will continue to
limit its military assistance to Cuba /to defensive
weapons7, Such a policy would not preclude the
provision of. more advanced jet fighters, surface-to-
air missiles, and medern radars, or even the pro-
vision of a token number of IL-28 jet light bombers..."
