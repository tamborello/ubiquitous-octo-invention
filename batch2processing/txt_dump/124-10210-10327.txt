Memorandum L'Allier to Belmont
Re: CARLOS MARCELLO

gt TRACKETEERING

did not know how the information had leaked to the press
it e assumed that there must have been some notice given to
newspapermen in the U.S. Because of this sudden appearance of

newspapermen, Guatemalan officials found it necessary to process
the subject's entry in a clandestine manner and in another building
which blocked any contact with newspaper people. This worked
successfully and the subject was immediately removed to a hotel

in the city.

} According to the newspapermen learned what happened

 

and some of the local writéfrs began criticizing the Guatemalan
President for his involvement in the entire episode. Some of the
President's political opposition accused him of protecting a

political position is extremely shaky. He accused er mishandling
the entire matter and has refused to deal with | on

accept him as a passenger even though he would be inadmissible in
the U.S. Pan American reportedly did this because Ydigoras had
issued orders cancelling flights of ail airlines going into and out
of the country if they refused to take Marcello as a. passenger.

Pan American apparently decided to gamble because the threatened
cancellation would be seriously damaging to the airlinds business.
