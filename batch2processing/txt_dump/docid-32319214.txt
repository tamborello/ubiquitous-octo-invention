On 8/10/98, discreet contact with General Marwan Zein
(protect), Commander, Beirut Police, failed to reveal additional
identifying data regarding the source of the information
contained in re EC, Colonel Nassib Abou-Shakra. ()

As the Bureau is aware, the security situation in Lebanon
remains tenuous at best. It is clear to Legat Athens that
Colonel Abou-Shakra, not further identified, appears to have been
a source of the Bureau, whether a symbol source or merely an
ongoing Legat. contact. Legat Athens does not currently have
access to records to verify this fact, particularly since the LS)

Re: (U) 62-HQ-1029205, 08/11/1998

Legal Attache office in Athens was opened. However, direct
contact with the Internal Security Forces in Lebanon with regard
to information provided to the FBI by a member of its agency, as
set forth in attachments to re EC, would merely serve to place
the actual source of that information, if in fact he or she still
exists, in serious jeopardy. It should be noted, as the Bureau

> is aware, the Lebanese Internal Security Forces are believed to
be penetrated by the Syrian intelligence services .(6)

. A review by Legat Athens of the information provided (y Cs)
Abou-Shakra reflects that it was public source information of
dubious value, manipulated provenance and minimal interest,
apparently overclassified when received.

For the information of FBIHO, (an 8/7/98 CIA traces were
conducted re Abou-Shakra, the results of which were inconclusive. \(S)

It is the recommendation of Legat Athens that the
information be released and made available, but that the source
of that information remain protected.

Should OPCA or Legat Rome have any questions or follow-up

with regard to this matter, please contact Legat James P. Shaw,
telephone 011 30 1 725 3024.
