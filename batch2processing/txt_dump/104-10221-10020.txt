2. Also note a Now York Times article of 28 June concerning

the Washington breakTn affair. This article states that an

individual appeared on the Miamf scene about two. months ago and :
recruited the team for the breakin. The recruiter was denerihbed

“Because in his opinion no Cuban could be recruited by an unknown

individual using .a code name.’ Considering the clandestine/
operational mentality of tha many Cubans in the Miami. area,

récruitments could only be made by a known recruiter with ade-

quate bona fides,
