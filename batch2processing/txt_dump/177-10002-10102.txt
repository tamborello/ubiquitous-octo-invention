was witnessed today by bystanders
at a crowded intersection in Saigon |

namese against Vietnamese. At the
intersection are three villas which
house the ICC delegations,

c. There were no Buddhist
overtones,

d. Some think the Viet Cong

who are fighting the Vietnamese.

achieves independence on 12 Decem-
ber. This will fall under the juris-
diction of communications minister
Oneko, who has well developed con-
tacts within the Soviet Bloc,

N c. TASS has already agreed to
. equip the new agency, and Kenyan re-
quests for further financial and
techincal help are being discussed
in Prague and Moscow.

ad. Kenyan journalists have
been training in Prague and, on re-
\ turn, will find ready employment in

5. Czechoslovakia- a. Czech President Novotny
USSR returned from Moscow on Thursday
after signing a renewal (for another
20 years) of the treaty of friend-
ship and. mutual assistance,

cessions, nor were there the usual
references to Czech "progress" or

another gathering of world Communist
party representatives.

e. The feelers it put out
after the conclusion of the test-
ban treaty were received coldly by
some of the fraternal parties. They
felt such a meeting could only make
matters worse with the Chinese,

f£. Indeed, Peiping saw this
to be Moscow's purpose, and when
the idea failed to take hold,the
Chinese took it to be a setback for
Khrushchev personally.

g. Their reaction to Khrush-
chev's subsequent call for a cessa-
tion of open argument was to press
_the offensive, and this they have
been doing in roundly abusive terms
since.

at midnight, but boosters for the
several candidates continued to mill
about streets of Caracas in defiance
of terrorist threats to shoot anyone
who ventured out for the next thre
days. :

comrades, of all women detained by
the government, and of the six hi-
jackers who have been returned fron
Trinidad to custody in Venezuela.

Soviets under present circumstances,
