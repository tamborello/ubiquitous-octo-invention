CONSIDERATIONS

CIA should select a feasible sabotage
operation, a showy" one against the
regime, but not against the people,
and present a specific proposal for
approval, .

’

Feasibility depends on CIA's judgment,
both operationally and for depth of

intelligence required. The sch was

PURPOSE

To provide material for opera-

Castro regime inside Cuba, and
for use on the OAS-UN opinion
slage.

To take the fullest possible advan-
tage of this open U.S. “listening

CONSIDERATIONS

Really current "inside"news tips can

do most to undermine the regime's morale
and interest the Cuban public. Classifi-
cation may be a problem but this use

must be pressed as a priority.

ONI can call upon CIA for agsistance. A
communication link to Miami would per -
mit use of extensive CLA background infor -

mation available there and leads for further

exploitation, not only for positive intelli-
gence, but also for counter-intelligence.
A number of further steps are possible. _

New words to a favorite S0ng, a new tune,
a visual symbol for wali ~painting, a hand

Guba operations. (STATE)

Make strong, repetitive theme

on radio broadcasts to Cuba of

the overwhelming disapproval
throughout the Western Hemisphere
of the Castro-Communist regime,
along with sympathy for the captive

 

 

PURPOSE

To assure full consideration of
material, as collected, in terms

of special psychological -propaganda
use against the Cuban regime, and
‘to inform the public.

To underrnine Castro's psycho-
logical basis of control over the
Cuban people and the lower echelons
of the regime's bureaucracy.

 

 

PAGE -4~

CONSIDERATIONS

This has been a normal State-chaired
working group. It needs to be sharply
geared to the project's operations,
including consideration of declassifying
material for operational use. Defense
should be added to the membership. It
is possible that USIA should assume
leadership,

This is to make full use of material
produced by actions in the Western
Hemisphere. ‘

fUSIA}

Ready the "Voice of Cuba" for
radio broadcast. {CLA}

 

To undermine Castro's psyche-
logical basis of control and to
build the tone for anti-Castro
actions in the Western Hemis~
phere.

To provide a ready capability for
giving a voice" to encourage
resistance elements inside Cuba
and to undermine the morale of
the Castro regime.

 

PAGE -5-

CONSIDERATIONS

Note the inclusion of defectors in this
task; it ia still a CIA task te produce
the defectors. Ales, this task includes
exploitation of Dr, Miro Cardona's
intensely moving statement at the end

of the Armstrong Circle Theater drama,
"Anatomy of Betrayal."

Initially, this would be fer brief news
broadcasts of local events inside Cuba,
simulating a location in Guba, but
actually/fouated off-shore.) A plan of
how best to do this, with the proposed

 

program format, is needed to obtain

policy decision.

Members of GAS need to be inspired

to push some special action through.
Current events offer a number of
opportunities for exploitation through
such OAS bodies as the Commission 4—
on Human Rights, the Peace Committee,
the Council of Jurists, and the Children's

institute, as well as the Special Con-
aultative Committee on Security. VA

4.

Develop a suggested platform of
Cuban political-economic objectives
for possible adoption by Cubans in
freeing their country. (STATE)

Assure that optimum values are
obtained from the CRC and Cuban
refugee groups in the U.S. (CIA)

PURPOSE

For the guidance ef Operation
Mongoose personnel, particularly
in the selection and readying of
agents to ensure that they are
committed to acceptable political
beliefs before introduction inte
Cuba.

These Cuban external groups have
a vital role for propaganda impact
inside Cuba. We must have pur-
poseful, singleness of guidance and
monitoring of their activities to
support the project.

CONSIDERATIONS

There are a number of statements of
Cuban political objectives, including
drafts by State and CIA. What is needed
now, and promptly, is a single working
document for the guidance of U.S.
operational staffe.

CIA and State both have had roles with |

the CRC and others. Cuban leaders also
make contact at a number of high offices

of the U.S. government. For the good

of the U.S., the Cuban refugees, and our
project, there must be coordinated manage ~-
ment. The Director, Central Intelligence,
should have this responsibility, particularly
with leaders of the stature of Dr. Jose
Miro Cardona. :
