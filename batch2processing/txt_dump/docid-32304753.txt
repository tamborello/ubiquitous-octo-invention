In regards to the "tip" alleged to have been re-
ceived by the "Bulletin" the following information may be
of interest:

PH~269-C, who can be characterized as reliable
and well informed, was contacted by ADRIAN LEE on Wednesday,
8/28/63, in an endeavor to ascertain where LEE could contact
Philadelphia AR Subject WILLIE WEISBERG. LEE told the
informant that he was preparing a series of articles in the
"Bulletin" about gambling and racket activity in Philadelphia
and wanted to contact WEISBERG in this regard. Informant in-
quired as to why LEE would contact WEISBERG, to which LEE re-
plied that WEISBERG furnished him information.

Philadelphia does not know if WEISBERG would be the
basis of a tip to the "Bulletin" to the effect that VALACHT'ts
information was not reliable. It does not appear probable,
however, inasmuch as WEISBERG during the current week has been
vacationing in Atlantic City, N.J., area and the fact is noted
that "Bulletin" employees MURPHY and BRUNT were in Atlanta mak-
ing inquiry on 8/26,27/63.

The above is for information of interested offices
and to alert them as to possible inquiry by MURPHY and BRUNT
in regards to VALACHI. If any additional information is ob-
tained by the Philadelphia Division in this regard, it will
pe forwarded to the Bureau and interested offices.
