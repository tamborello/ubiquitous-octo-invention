3 April 1957, Subject: 16th National Convention of the Communist Party,
USA: Internal Security, in which Dr. King is mentioned on page 316, are
both considered fo be lost. An intensive search of the files and indices has
failed to locate these documents.

Search by other Agency components has produced some duplication of |
the materials already listed as well as the following:

2. An FBI letter, dated 21 December 1964, to the CIA with -
a memorandum entitled: Martin Luther King, Jr., His Personal
Conduct;

b. A 28 January 1968 CIA memorandum commenting-on-the
FBI study "The New Left: Road to Anarchy; " :

c. A 29 March 1968 memorandum from CIA to FBI containing
volunteered information regarding King! s activities concerning the
Poor People! s Campaign; 4

7

d. A 14-page report on Black Power which mentions King;

e. A 28 November 1975 CIA memorandum from 1G to DCI
which refers to a dissemination of information made to FBI concerning
King's European trip in 1964;

There are, moreover, two other items held in this Office which, although
not specifically requested by you, might be ‘helpful to your inquiry. One indicates
an Agency program, but in evidence of FBI involvement, while the other indicates
an FBI activity which the FBI is unaware this Agency has knowledge of. This
information will also be available to you if you request.

I believe that the information contained herein is responsive to your re-
quest. From.a review of these materials it does not appear that this Agency was

‘ever--wittingly or unwittingly--involved with or importuned by the FBI to mount

or carry out any operations against Dr. King to discredit him, to prevent him

‘from any undertaking, or to frustrate him in regard to any endeavor or objective.

Please note that all of these documents were forwarded to this Office on an
"on loan" basis and retain their. present classification. It is our recommendation

that if you wish to review the documents, this may be accomplished here in

DoclId: 32400591 Page 5

 
 

 

Headquarters in the presence of representatives from both the originating
component and this Office. Should you determine through this review that -
you require copies of any of the materials, additional coordination must then
be accomplished prior to transmitting any of these documents to you. ,

Please contact me if you have any further questions, or if you wish to
arrange to review any of these materials.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Folsom: : _

Re: Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., Department of

Pursuant to your requests, dated 24 September and 19. November 1976,
for information regarding the extent and nature of FBI/CIA contact concerning
Martin Luther King, Jr., a search of Agency files likely to contain the re-
quested information was requested.. Numerous FBI documents which either
mention or concern Reverend King as well as a limited number of internal .
documents which relate to FBI/CIA interest in Reverend King have been found.

A brief list of documents located by our Office of Security appears

below: . ; \
a. Both CIA and FBI originated documents, including an .

FBI report on "Martin Luther King Jr., ~ A Current Analysis,"
which appear to relate to referenced request.

‘b. Documents taken from the CIA file on a confidential

informant and which appear to relate to referenced request.

“*The documents refer to The Reverend Martin Luther King,.. ...""
together with other civil rights leaders, and it is presumed that
the substance of the information contained within these documents
was passed to the FBI through our routine liaison channels. —

c. Documents of a 23 May 1967 FBI study entitled "Racial
Violence Potential in the United States this Summer," which refers
in part to Reverend King. : .
