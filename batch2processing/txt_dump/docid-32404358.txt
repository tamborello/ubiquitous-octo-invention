NOTE FOR: Director, Center for the Study
of Intelligence
Deputy Director
Office of Congressional Affairs

FROM: John Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: JFK/Possible Letter from
Congressman Burton to EXDIR

Jeremy Gunn, Executive Director of the JFK Board, told
HRG yesterday that Congressman Dan Burton may well write a
letter to the EXDIR expressing concern about whether CIA
will be able to meet the deadline for declassification of
assassination-related records. Burton chairs the Government
Reform and Oversight Committee which has cognizance over the
JFK Board.

Gunn said that he briefed members of Burton’s staff
last week and told them he was concerned that the Agency may
not have enough resources dedicated to JFK to finish the
review of documents by 1 September 1998. Gunn showed the
staffers the recent exchange of letters between the Board
and the EXDIR on the same issue. According to the staffers,
Burton has a strong personal interest in the release of the
assassination records. The staffers gave Gunn the
impression that Burton’s strong interest will prompt him to
write to the Agency.

During our discussion with Gunn, we reviewed with him
the Agency’s clear commitment to declassifying all
assassination records. We also explained that we have
shifted four additional contractors to the JFK project, and
will shift more if necessary, even at the cost of slowing
down or stopping other declassification efforts.
