Since the period involved here is the same

one GOLTTSYN thinks NOSENKO is covering up in
his own biography (1955-57), this might indeed
be a clue to an important penetration.

(2) We are examining U. S. Embassy departees
from Moscow during 1956, and are preparing a paper
presenting the circumstances of one possible
theory.

£. NOSENKO did, in fact, have the woman trouble
he claims, but GOLITSYN "recalls" that this took place
in 1957 or 1958, not in 1954, and this was the reason
he was transferred out of the more sensitive American
Department to the Tourist Department.

Comment:

(1) GOLITSYN also said that the events
‘must have happened" after NOSENKO became a CP
member (in 1956-57), suggesting GOLITSYN is
not stating a fact but making a supposition.
' ‘ It is not clear, in fact, whether GOLITSYN
knows or supposes that this caused NOSENKO's
transfer out of II/1l into II/7.

g. The post of Assistant Section Chief -- which
GOLITSYN says NOSENKO claimed to occupy in 1960-62 --
was abolished in 1959, those holding this title being
made senior case officers.

Note: GOLITSYN is apparently confusing

‘POMNACH (Assistant to the Chief)

with ZAMNACH (Deputy Chief).

NOSENKO also reported that Pomnaches
. were abolished and made senior case
ae officers, while Zamnaches continue to

this day. GOLITSYN must also believe
-- this, since he has reported GRYAZNOV

as Zamnach II/1/l.

6. Statements of opinion: In addition to the opinions
connected with the facts summarized above, GOLITSYN provided
a nuaber of opinions, theories and suppositions on various
detailed aspects of this case. by and large, these merely
provicle additional support for opinions already presented

 

HW 53216 DocId:32404751 Page 3
HW 53216

in our earlier reports on this operation, GOLITSYN concluded
without doubt that NOSENKO is a KGB provocateur, that the
operation could only have been run with KHRUSHCHEV's personal
approval, and that it is designed among other things to hide
various penetrations, one perhaps related to the POPOV com-
promise, and some of them threatened by leads provided by
GOLITSYN. He considered that the NOSENKO operation is being
run in close coordination with the KROTKOV and CHEREPANOV
provocations, and that in order to carry out his mission
properly NOSENKO must know many of the significant truths

the KGB is trying to hide or protect. He believes that much
of what NOSENKO has said is keyed to KGB knowledge, rather
than supposition, about what GOLITSYN had reported to Western
intelligence authorities. Since all of this has already been
dealt with in detail in our carlier analysis, it is not re-
peated in the body of this memorandun,

aware in detail of who served in II/1/1 until
his departure for Helsinki in July 1960, and
because he visited sioscow and I1/1 in December
1960 and talked with the then head of II/1/1,
KOVSHUK. He would have known if NOSENKO were
in the section then at all, much less as deputy
chief.

However:

- NOSENKO was away in Cuba until 15
December 1960 and thus may not have
been there at the time. Nonetheless,
the fact that he had become Deputy
would presumably have come out of
GOLITSYN's talks with KOVSHUK, anyway.

- GOLITSYN had earlier said that PETROV

was chief of II/1/1, GRYAZNOV the deputy.
Insofar as SR records show, GOLITSYN had

never named KOVSHUK in this position, as

far as we know, until he saw the NOSENKO

materials. KOVSHUK was, of course, named
by GOLITSYN many times as an active case

officer in II/1/1.

e. Contrary to NOSENKO's statement that GORBATENKO
remained as chief of II/1 until 1959, GOLITSYN knew that
GORBATENKO was sent as senior KGB advisor to Hungary
shortly after the Hungarian Revolution, probably about
January 1957,

Comments:

(1) Since this is a high-powered job and
represented a promotion, GOLITSYN thinks it may
well have been given to GORBATENKO as a result of
success in operations against the American Embassy,
specifically a recruitment. GOLITSYN thinks NOSENKO
may be covering this up by changing the dates of
GORBATENKO's transfer, and associates this with
KOVSHUK's trip to the U. S. in early 1957, pre-
sumably to follow up or complete a Moscow Embassy
recruitment (about which trip NOSENKO also gave
apparent disinformation, linking it to the “ANDREY"
case, which we all agree is unlikely, especially
since “ANDREY' left Moscow in the spring of 1954).

HW 53216 DocId:32404751 Page @
(3) Supporting GOLITSYN's statement,
however, are the following points:

(a} DERIABIN considers it quite
possible that an American Department man
might be used in a Tourist Department opera-
tion, if he had qualifications needed and
others were not available at the time.

There is an outside chance that this is
what happened here.

(b) In the 1962 meetings with CIA,
NOSENKO claimed to have personally par-
ticipated in the recruitment operation in
1956 against U. S. Embassy security officer,
Edward Smith. When confronted in 1964 with
this carlier statement, NOSENKO vigorously
denied it. His earlier claim could thus
have been a slip, or perhaps merely a gratui-
tous beast (paralleling his 1962 claim to
have been involved in the October 1959
attempt against Russ Langelle).

(c) NOSENKO has reported personal par-
ticipation in only a few checkable tourist-
line activities during the years 1955-58
although his year 1959 is replete with them,
almost all confirmed independently.

(d) The only other independently known
activity of NOSENKO during this period was
two trips to England in August 1957 and
October 1958. These, he claims, were merely
to serve as watchdog for two Soviet sporting
groups (and to give him some flavor of the
West). They could presumably have taken him
from II/l just as well as from II/7.

d. NOSENKO did not work in II/l at any time in

1960, and therefore it is unthinkable that he was there
for the one year 1961 either.

HW 53216 DocId: 32404751

Comments:

(1} This confirms our finding, as reported
in ll Slay report.

(2) GOLITSYN clains to know this because he was

Page 7
  

a. This man is the person he says he is,

Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO, the son of former Minister
NOSENKO, and he really was a KGB officer.

Comnents:

(1) GOLITSYN knows this because he says
he knew NOSENKO personally, having met him two
or three times in II/1/l1 in 1953 when GOLITSYN
was there on other business. GOLITSYN also met
NOSENKO occasionally at work in 1958-1959. In
1959, GOLITSYN asked NOSENKO where he worked,
and NOSENKO said in the Tourist Department.
GOLITSYN asked him about CHURANOV. In addition,
NOSENKO and GOLITSYN know one another indirectly
through their common friends CHURANOV, GUK,
KASHEYEV, etc.

(2) NOSENKO, however, could not identify
the photo of GOLITSYN and, when told who it was,
repeated his earlier statements that he had
never met GOLITSYN and would of course remember
if he had. He had once been shown a group photo
of him, (It is difficult to see why NOSENKO
would lie about this, since we clearly could
check through GOLITSYN and a contrary statement
would throw immediate doubt on NOSENKO's bona
fides, and there would apparently be nothing for
him to lose merely admitting it. This raises the
question of why GOLITSYN might lie about this
point, similarly not very easy to answer.)

 

b. NOSENKO served in II/1/1 from 1953 until 1957

or 1958, and was specifically responsible during the
period 1953-54 for American military personnel in the
Embassy. In 1955-57-58 he may have had the same
responsibilities, or may have been working against
other Embassy personnel or correspondents, but was
definitely in II/1/l.

Comments:

HW 53216 DocId:32404751

(1) NOSENKO says he was in IT/1/1, working
first against correspondents and then against
military personnel, from March 1953 until mid-1955,
and claims then to have transferred to the 7th

 

Page 5 bon
(Tourist) Departinent of the Second Chief
Directorate (II/7).

(2) In our own analysis of NOSENKO's
story (ll May report) we had expressed doubts
that NOSENKO actually even served in the Ameri-
can Department at all, since he was so vague
about details he should have known, since he
was suspiciously self-contradictory aout when
he entered and what he did, and since his later
period in that Department (1960-62) is clearly
a complete fabrication.

c. NOSENKO served from 1957 or 1958 in the
Tourist Department (I1I/7), where in 1959 he was a
senior case officer.

Comments:

(1) As noted above, this contradicts

NOSENKO's story of having made this transfer
in mid-1955, thus creating a period of two to
three years which NOSENKO's legend is trying

r to cover up. This suggests to GOLITSYN that
there was some success in the Embassy during
this period, which is supported by other ob-
servations (see below).

(2) There is reason to doubt the validity
of GOLITSYN's statement, since NOSENKO is in-
dependently known to have been involved in at
least one, and perhaps two, strictly tourist-
type operations involving U. S. citizens in the
period 1956-1958, One was Richard BURGI, whom
NOSENKO recruited in June 1956 in the company of
Anatoliy KOZLOV, Chief of II/7, who has confirmed
NOSENKO's story and identified his picture.
There was possibly one other American, Gisella
Harris, in 1957 (she tentatively but uncertainly
identified his photo) and he claims to have worked
on three foreigners, one of whom, Sir Alan Lane,
British, has confirmed the story and recognized
NOSENKO's photo. The two others (Hans GERKENS,
a German and Fnu SUENDER, a Norwegian) have not
yet been identified.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI Staff
SUBJECT: COLITSYN's comments on the

NOSENKO Case

Introduction and General Assessment

 

1. In reviewing the value and validity of GOLITSYN's
comments on the NOSENKO case, it must be borne in mind
that although his current comments do not provide much
that is new GOLITSYN himself has always been a key to our
understanding of the NOSENKO case. In 1962 NOSENKO's in-
formation was closely keyed to what we could presume to be
a KGB damage assessment of GOLITSYN's defection, a fact
which we only noticed on comparison of NOSENKO's informa-
tion with GOLITSYN's, Similarly, what GOLITSYN had told
us about Department "D'" enabled us to see how such a high-
level provocation could be run. Furthermore, his most
recent comments do in fact provide useful support to our
analysis which had already been completed. We do need now
to assess how much GOLITSYN may be in a position to help
in our assessment and future handling of NOSENKO and other
ramifications of this KGB provocation. His value and future
contribution can be assessed on several levels:

a. How much new hard information can h
contribute?

b. How much new insight can he provide us
through his own knowledge of KGB procedures and
personnel applied to the materials of this case?

c. How much guidance can he provide in our
future manipulation of these operations and in
breaking KROTKOV and NOSENKO?

2. Point "a" is discussed in paragraph 5 below. While
there are several useful items, the total of new hard facts
is not great, On point "b", his insight, as reflected in his
oral comments and analysis, is disappointing as one would
have expected him to provide a more penetrating analysis
than that which we completed carlier. And in point ''c"
he himself admits to having no idea about how to break

 

HW 53216 Docld:32404751 Page 3
NOSENKO and KROTKOV, other than to point out that it will
be most difficult, that we need to do some more groundwork
and preparation before proceeding to an active attempt to
do so (including perhaps uncovering a penetration of the
U. S. Embassy, Moscow first), and that we should use well
qualified interrogators.

3. We are faced at this point with the eminently com-
plicated task of breaking NOSENKO. (While preparing to do
so we are keeping him productive and examining the ramifi-
cations of the operation.) Our great need now is for hard,
incontrovertible facts with which we can confront NOSENKO,
to prove to him that our conviction about his guilt is
based on something more than analysis, which is what he
now evidently thinks it is. For this, our only immediate
asset is GOLITSYN, who looms so importantly as a factor in
this operation. We therefore hope, despite GOLITSYN's
relative lack of contribution thus far, to exhaust all pos-
sibilities and get from him every possible detail. Therefore,
since there are many loose ends and unclear bits from his
29 June report, we are preparing followup questions for
GOLITSYN which might assist our task. Some of these questions
are attached hereto as Attachment A.

4. GOLITSYN's principal report on the NOSENKO case was
contained in the oral presentation of 28 June 1964. As
background for his study of the case, GOLITSYN was given a
wide range of materials on NOSENXO including 113 pages of
responses to specific questions GOLITSYN wanted put to
NOSENKO (see attachment B for a listing of all materials
pertaining to NOSENKO which were shown to GOLITSYN). In
addition, GOLITSYN -was given the CHEREPANOV papers with
supporting documentation, as well as the KROTKOV case and
manuscript, the BELITSKIY, the UNACUTE and POPOV cases.

In general, this was nearly everything available to us in
our analysis of 25 March, 11 May and 8 July, with the ex-
ception of the SCOTCH case. :

What GOLITSYN said

5. Statements of fact: What GOLITSYN could contribute
in the form of personal knowledge, as against supposition,
LS summarized in the subparagraphs below. Comments on each
point are appended where appropriate. Several of these
points are of real assistance, but certain aspects of their
content or presentation weakens their impact or opens them
and the source's accuracy to some question.
