on to informant, and finally admitted to informant that.
HERNANDEZ “just did not care: for the informant. Informant
» discussed the situation with MILLER and. DOMINIC: DIBELLA,
who. instructed informant to tell HERNANDEZ that.if he aia
' not “sit still" he; HERNANDEZ, would be "hit." DIBELLA
told informant he ‘received the go ahead to ‘Say this from
‘ROSS PRIO. .

Informant relates that after this original difficulty,
he and HERNANDEZ ‘have an "understanding" © so.that hé is now
‘on friendly terms with him. “HERNANDEZ has told informant.
that he has worked in the past with and: for’: SANTO TRAFFICANTE,
both in Miami and in Cuba. :. He did‘ not’ indicate the present
rélationship: between himself and TRAFFICANTE, but tried to
leave the impression that a degree of relationship does" :
exist. -

The informant advised on April 9, 1964, that FRANK
HERNANDEZ, previously’ mentioned as being closely associated
with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, recently made a trip to New York
with BERT DUBBIN. for the purpose of making arrangements
to work on the new liner being purchased: by DUBBIN, the
"Italia," to be docked off of Freeport, Bahamas; FRANK
MILLER told the. informant that TRAFFICANTE ‘advised MILLER
during a previous meeting that if anything’.should ‘happen
to FRANK HERNANDEZ, the: same thing would happen to the
individual responsible, apparently referring ‘to the veiled
threats by the informant concerning the help of HERNANDEZ.

 

; i: Information in Miami files, it appears very
reasonable that SANTO TRAFFICANTE and ‘BENJAMIN H. GOLOB
are acquainted with each other but it ‘appears that GOLOB

, is more an associate and business confidant of ANGELO
BRUNO than subject. ,

' Departmental Attorney WILLIAM S. KENNEY, with
whom liaison -is maintaimed by the Miami Office, has
furnished no additional information regarding ANTONIO
IBARRO, previously reported as allegedly being a half-
brother. of the subject. : : .

With regard to the individual known as "Chopper"
previously. referred to as an errand boy for SANTO TRAFFICANTE,
it is believed by the Miami Office that this most likely
refers to MACHO GENER whose description® approximatés ‘that of

Miami letter dated July.31, 1964 set forth the
following: - “ ths . wut. .

_The information set forth below is the result
of contact with confidential informant CG’6538-C-TE,
on March'19, and March 25, 1964, at Miami, Florida. © In:
view of the fact that this informant is intimately involved
in the. information which he has furnished, it is requestéd
that this information be placed on the’ Administrative pages
of the” report: and not in the. detaiis.

Informant is now involved .- full time on the
- "Calypso. Liner" Cruise Boat operating ‘between Miami,
Florida, and‘ Bimini, Bahamas, B.W:I. His: full time partner
in this venture is FRANK MILLER, previously described by the
informant as "bag man" for Broward County:SO... In addition,
informant has agreed to pay DOMINIC DIBELLA one-half of-his,
informant's, share which will. go toward retirement. of his :
debt to the ROSS.PRIO Organization. As’ was stated earlier,
this venture is a modified version of the "Razzle Dazzle,"
with the exception that prizes.are given in. the form of
perfume; cameras, watches, etc. These prizes, however,
may be exchanged for’ cash, which is usually the case. HENRY
DUBBINS, operator of the "Calypso," has issued specific
instructions to informant that the game must be run in
such a manner as to not cause heat to be brought to-bear
by. irate victims, and as a resuit, the game is quasi-
legitimate. .
‘Informant is now in a position whereby he has
saved $1,100 for DIBELLA, which will be given to him upon
his next “trip to Miami, which will be monentarily-.

Informant states there was a considerable amount
of difficulty in finally. proceeding with the game, in that one
FRANK HERNANDEZ, ‘DUBBINS' representative on’ the boat, was
omen" SAS PECLOUS of -the-informant - -and- FRANK -MILLER-and:-passed-on-
these suspicions to DUBBINS, stating that informant was
under investigation by the Government. ‘DUBBINS passed this
