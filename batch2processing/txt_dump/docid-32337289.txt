It is pointed out for the Biireau's ‘

consideration that BRYKIN may Se source or
sources with the knowledge that nows of this
assembly place, and that BRYKIN is testin,

to see if he will be truthful in this matter.

It appears some decision must be made
as to whether, and how much, inf, tion should
furnish BRYKIN regarding this. as portrayed
himself to BRYKIN as a believer in € revolutionary
forces now in control of Cuba and he feels that
BRYKIN believes him, however, he is not completely
convinced of this

BRYKIN told Ihe would return
from abroad as soon as poss e. got the -
impression that BRYKIN said he woul e€ in Cu

ba to
“organize Something", but he was not certain. (AY

BRYKIN that if anything
important comes up, will be contacted at
s place of employment. »&)

BRYKIN said that in the event
is not contacted before hand, BRYKIN will m at
7:30-p.m. on 6/29/62, at the intersegtion of 181st Street
and Broadway, Manhattan, New York.

[ __ stated he believes this time and ~
place mean nothing to BRYKIN, because he has noted in

the past that when they made an appointment, BRYKIN

was always very careful to'write the date, time and

place down. In. this instance, he did not make a note

of the meeting place or ime. GRY)

A discreet observation point was’ maintained
in this area during the pertinent period by SAS PAUL
L. BRINTON and HARRY E. MORRIS, Jr., and the above meet
was observed. Also, during this period, SAS BRINTON
amd MORRIS observed a two tone blue 1958 Ford, 1962

130th Street and 125th Street. This car contained
a lone male who was unidentifiable under the circumstances
of distance and lighting conditions. During the period,
‘it was observed this car changed parking places three
times as it progressed slowly from 130th Street to
125th Street Cds
Automobile registration 507384, as observed
‘on this car, was issued to HERMAN P, LEVAKOV, a Soviet
National yoo. de,suployed as a translator-trainee,

BRYKIN was observing him closely and he did not think
it advisable to get the license number of this car.
He said that after they entered the automobile,
BRYKIN drove about the area for a short time and
again seemed to be trying to locate any surveillance
that- might be in effect.

stated that eventually they went

to Queens, NY, where the subject stopped the car at
a filling station at the intersection of what the
informant described as Marathon Parkway and Long
Island Parkway. BRYKIN instructed the. attendant to
put gas in the car, ceeate te 2 and to take his
time. .BRYKIN instructed to remain in the ,
car. BRYKIN then went inside the service station

was out of sight of the informant.

stated' he is of the opinion that BRYKIN
made a telephone call, however, he carld not actually
see him do so. He stated he that BRYKIN pasa
-$3.15 for the gas he bought Ge:

‘It appears that BRYKIN may have-pHoenéed |
LEVAKOV or whoever was in LEVAKOV's vehicle at
the meet determ y physical surveillance
had pec AReaee arcs, said that when BRYKIN
_ reentered the car, they drove for four or five blocks,
_ perhaps on Sunset Lake Boulevard, or some similar named
‘street and then turned right, eventually arriving | at
a bar, restaurant, inn or tavern, naméd "Hilltop."
He stated BRYKIN indicated he had lived or had been
in that area before. pointed out that he
knows nothing about the area they were in, and was
hazy as to the streets and location. He said he could
not give a proper account of their location, however,
he was sure he could identify the Hilltop establishment
if he sees it again. (ANU)
