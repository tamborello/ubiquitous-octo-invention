HUMPHREYS: Then say I won't be available until Thursday.
> ; I°1l be around; but no. lunch. Then they..can't
say to one another, well Thursday is. the day.
Don't say nothing, just do it ourselves.
Then if we want to go out and talk to MOONEY,
or want to go out West, we can catch then,

and talk. to them, and go over, and we've got.....

I think that’s your best bet, FRANK. Then if
you've got a problem, you call me, and say,
meet me at: so and so, and then I meet you.

We go over to the car or go over to HENRY
SUSK's, or where ever it is, and we talk about
whatever it is, and then break up.

FERRARO: That's a good idea.

HUMPHREYS: Because this every day, every day, one day,
near elections, they’11 try to catch every body
- together, -

It is believed that. the above reference to "HENRY
SUSK's" is to a suite which HENRY SUSK maintains in the St. Clair
Hotel under the name of JOE HENRY.’ This suite is located at the
southeast corner on the fourteenth floor of the hotel and is
numbered 14E. It is noted that information concerning HENRY
SUSK is set out herein above under. the caption “Associates”,
sub-caption “HENRY SUSK",

In February, 1960, TURA SATANA, one.of the leading
burlesque dancers in the United States, advised SA ROEMER that
she has been intimately associated with HENRY.SUSK for the past
several years and that he has advised her that he maintains
Room 14E in the St. Clair Hotel, not farticularly for his own
use, but for the use of his associates who, when they visit
Chicago, do not like to register in a hotel so that a record
will be kept of their presence in Chicago. Miss SATANA furnished
a floor plan of the suite maintained by SUSK and it was noted that

. it consists of a bedroom, living room, and bath.

CG 6343-C* advised that on . March 8, 1960, FRANK
FERRARO went over the expenses which were incurred during the
month of February by his bodyguard and runner, HY GODFREY.
During the course of the conversation, it became apparent
that GODFREY was given a "thousand dollar bank roll" every
month in order to meet the expenses incurred by him in running
errands and making telephone calls for the Chicago top hoodlums.

In tallying the bills submitted by GODFREY in
explanation for his expenses, FERRARO was heard to comment,
"St. Clair, cab, $85.00".

CG 6343-C* advised on March 7, 1960, that on that date HY

GODFREY asked FRANK FERRARO if he should meet him at "three
o'clock in the lobby?" and FERRARO replied "second floor",

GODFREY apparently was used to meeting FERRARO in the lobby

and in order to confirm FERRARO expected to meet him in the

usual place, he then asked "the St. Clair?" and FERRARO ve
replied "Better make it second’ floor". GODFREY then asked

"What do you want to do if he doesn’t show? Now if he's in

_ there at 3:30 that. means I gotta meet you and see you tonight".
:Informant advised that it was apparent to him that FERRARO and

GODFREY intended to meet someone at the St. Clair Hotel at
3:30 p.m.

Normandy Lounge

CG 6343-C* advised on January 18, 1960, that on that
date, SAM GIANCANA was asked by an unknown individual, possibly
RAY NICCOLAI, where FERRARO was and GIANCANA replied "he went
to Washington".

- It is believed that GIANCANA referred to the
Normandy Lounge which is located on Washington Street just west

of LaSalle Street, across the street from City Hall in Chicago's
Loop. '

pcIl_—id|has advised SA ROEMER that this is a.
well known meeting place for FERRARO, ALEX, and Alderman JOHN

I RALPH KELLY advised SA HARRY A, WALKER on
February 13. 1960, that over the past several months he has
heard rumors that SAM GIANCANA and WILLIE "Potatoes" DADDANO
had been bucking one another for: control of the Chicago
Crime Syndicate which has been left vacant by ANTHONY J.
ACCARDO, This PCI advised that ROBERf PRANNO, who was
placed in power as the front man for the Aurora - Kane
County Amusement Company, would lose his position if
DADDANO achieves eminence over GIANCANA,, in view of
the fact that PRANNO was placed in this position by
GIANCANA,. : : \
; It is noted that information obtained from
CG 6343-C* and other informants who are in a better
position to have information con¢erning the activities of
GIANCANA have not indicated that there is any dispute
between GIANCANA, DADDANO and ACCARDO.

It would appear that HUMPHREYS referred to the

* health of ALEX in view of the fact that information has

NW 45679

previously been developed that during the past nine months
or so ALEX has been extremely concerned with his health

and has been virtually "retired" from activities involving
the Chicago Crime Syndicate as is set out elsewhere: in

the co¥er pages of this report under the caption "Travel".
It.is noted that ALEX has spent very. ‘Little time in Chicago
during. recent months.

MURRAY HUMPHREYS

Concerning the status of HUMPHREYS health,
reference is made to the comment of HUMPHREYS reported
immediately above concerning his remarks to GIANCANA
that "the older {I get the better I get".

CG 6343-C* advised on January 26, 1960, MURRAY
HUMPHREYS had a brief conversation with PAT MARCI, secretary
to Alderman JOHN D'ARCO, of the lst Ward, City of Chicago. ~
MARCI asked HUMPHREYS how he felt and HUMPHREYS told him
that he felt"pretty good. I have that trouble at night.
Keeps me up half the night. They give me some medicine
that works pretty good."' /

On January 28, 1960, HUMPHREYS told JOEY GLIMCO,
according to CG 6343-C*, that he "had a bad night last night".

C, Marital Status

MURRAY HUMPHREYS

\

As has been set out \above under the caption "Residence"
in reference to HUMPHREYS residence in Key Biscayne, Florida,
information has been‘developed by the Miami Office indicating
that HUMPHREYS is residing in Key Biscayne, in a house which
may value $70,000. This house is owned ostéhsibly by one |
BETTY JEANNE NEIBERT, who is believed to be the present wife
of MURRAY HUMPHREYS,although it is not known that HUMPHREYS
had benefit of a civil or religious ceremony :to bind their
relationship. ' However, information has been developed through
former PCI FRANCIS P, LEE that HUMPHREYS divorced his wife of
36 years in the summer of 1957 and that shortly thereafter he

COVER PAGE

 

 

DociId:32286329 Page 5
CG 92-795

married a younger woman. It would appear that the younger
woman referred to by[___]is BETTY JEANNE NEIBERT,

On March 3, 1960, SA ROBERT F, FETZNER of the
Miami Office observed a woman leave the residence of
HUMPHREYS at 210 Harbor Drive in Key Biscayne, Florida,
driving a 1959 Thunderbird. SA FETZNER observed that
this woman was white, age, middle 30's, 5'6" in height,
135 pounds, blond hair. It is noted that this woman
exactly fits the discri of HUMPHREYS wife which
was given by former PCI and by HENRY VAN BERKERKHONE,
‘ the manager of the apartment building where HUMPHREYS |
maintains an apartment in Chicago, with the exception
that both[ Jand’ VAN DERKERKHONE advised that HUMPHREYS
new wife was approximately 5°2" or 5'3" in height.

On March 4, 1960, ROBERT WALL, Director of
Personnel, Florida Light and Power Company, Miami, advised
that his company as of that time was furnishing service
to a Mrs. LEWIS HART at 210 Harbor Drive in Key Biscayne,
and has furnished said service since April 23, 1959. It is
noted that VAN DERKERKHONE, above, advised that residing
with HUMPHREYS and his wife in apartment 1001 at 4200 North
Marine Drive in Chicago last spring was an individual
who used the name HART, It is also noted that HUMPHREYS
has previously used the first name of LEWIS. It would
therefore, seem that it is very possible that "Mrs. .
LEWIS HART", BETTY JEANNE NEIBERT and HUMPHREYS wife
are one and the same person.

II, CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

Information appearing under this caption is set
out herein in order to show the interests of ACCARDO, ALEX,
FERRARO, GIANCANA and HUMPHREYS not only in criminal activities
but in other activities of interest to the Chicago Crime
Syndicate. It is believed that this information will show
that these five hoodlums have many interests which interlock
and which thereby show the existence of the Chicago Crime
Syndicate and the activities of these individuals in support
of the Chicago Crime Syndicate.

very shortly by airplane for his Miami area residence, HUMPHREYS
then asked GODFREY: "How much is my bill over there at the

hotel?" ‘By GODFREY’s answer it was apparent that HUMPHREYS

was at that time residing in the, St. Clair Hotel in Chicago
through arrangements made for him by GODFREY.

CG 6343-C* advised on January 28, 1960, that-.on
that date HUMPHREYS was in conversation with Chicago top.
hoodlum JOEY GLIMCO. They discussed the fact that on the
following Sunday evening they intended to have dinner and
take in the floor show at Mangum's Chateau, a night club
and restaurant located on Ogden Avenue in Lyons, Illinois,-
just west of Chicago. GLIMCO indicated to HUMPHREYS that
he would call him Sunday morning concerning arrangements
for travelling +o Lyons and asked him what room he was
staying in. HUMPHREYS told him that he was residing in
room 14E, .

It is noted that information has been developed
previously that HUMPHREYS and the other Chicago top hoodlums
frequently meet at the St. Clair and have conferences therein.
It has also been developed that-HENRY SUSK, concerning whom
information is set out hereinbelow under. the caption "Associates",
maintains a permanent room, 14E, at the St. Clair Hotel under
the name of JOE HENRY. Former PCI TURA SATANA, a well known
burlesque dancer, has advised SA ROEMER that as of February,
1960, SUSK continued to rent room 14E on a permanent basis
and that he told her that he rents this room for friends
of his who may come into town and who do not desire to
register with the management of the hotel in order that
no record will be kept of their presence in Chicago.

has discussed with other Chicago top hoodlums the fact
that they are "protected,from the owner on down" at the
