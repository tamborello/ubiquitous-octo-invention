| | it has previously been pointed out that one

vd. of our primary goais in the Crifiinal Intelligence Program

‘ Y is the full identification and subsequent prosecution of
the membership of La Cosa Nostra (LCN), the dominant group
in organized crime im this country. With an ever increasing

public awareness of the significance of LON on 2 national
basis, and in consideration of the Bureau's heavy
responsibilities in the field of organized erime, it dis
necessary that complete intelligence be developed regarding

 

| A veview of progress reported in the identification
of members of LCN reveals that a substantial number have been .
identified by many Gffices; however, your Office has identi- be
fied only four members within your Division. This serves
to highlight the urgent need for the Dallas Office to obtain +.
sources who can reliably identify LCN membership within your oS
Division. The basic makeup of LCN within. your Division has
been relatively undeveloped. .

. i

Our investigations of LEN have revealed the absolute -."
necessity of establishing sources who are in a position to a
provide accurate and authentic date regarding this organization. ° —.
it has also been shown that a complete picture con¢erning the
prevalence of LCN in a particular area cannet be established 7

without such sources. j
You are expected te show a marked improvement in . 4
identifying LCN. members within. your Division. To this. end, vo OS

there must be a concentrated and imaginative effort to

 

penetrate LCN with member-informants. The significant aa)
achievements by many offices in this field point. out that a P
hard-hitting,,-continuous program will produce concrete results. §.
