Senator Frank Church, chairman of the Senate Select Committee to
Study Governmental Operations with Respect te Intalligence Activi-
ties, has requested the assistance ef the National Archivae and
Records Service in obtaining permission for members of the Com-
mittee staff to examine material which was classified by your
agency and is now among the Presidential papers in the John F.
Kennedy Library. A liet of the files to which the Committee
desires access ia anclosed.

Senator Church has designated the follewing Committee staff
members te teview the Kennedy Library materials, and he has
indicated that each currently helds the security clearances
