fous, while LEIBIBG?S occasionally thinks of returning tp painting end
giving ert leecone end develope qualas sbout taking money from BOWEOH for
what be senedders to ba Little result, LIRKMI-3 keeps involving himeelf
decpor and deeper in activities of interest to ROWFOH,

3. Fhe cbove docs not mean that LIBING*3'e eotivities should act
be eubjected to every operatioas] control possible, on the contrary.
LERING?9's story concerning the msnncr in vhich birth cortiffcstes can
be obtained in Korthern Kexico to secure valid Mexican passports continues,
for example, to be suspect, It sow appears, on the other hand, thet
SQaBCIA" of the Guatemalan VAR existe (LIRINO"4 talked to him) ead that
be does sot want LIRING-3 to coms in contact with other Keuleo residents
connected with the Gustemalen guerrillas ouch a9 the alleged FAR propegaads
fopresentative at the UNAM Univareity. LIRING<3 {s convinced he can lay
on 4 apoting with GABCIA in advance so thet ROWFON can have @ look et
the Gustemalen. Is spite of GARCIA's cautiousneas, such « meeting has
to taka place sooner or later, The Ststion is ready, It sloo sppesrs
thas fa reasons as yet unclear, Hexican leftists such es Sergio PYALDEZ,
Reul aad others ere seeking LIRING73 and eppear to want something

LIBENG aod it's steff paid off vhen LIBING@4 vas asked ¢o "£411 in” whea
ons of the sacretarics in LIRING"9'o section had to return home temporerily
on sick leave, It already appears that LIRING?4, an oxporienced hand in
LIRING-9's overt businesa, will be given quite o bit of responsibility ta
that office, It ie hoped thet by becoming quasi indispansable she vill
be aoked to remain st LIRING after the return of the person for whos she
iy "£8lling in.” LIBRING?4, while vory much in love with ber husband, has
# wind of her own, 6 grest liking for ROwEG? and, according te LIRING?3
bimself, an intelligence mich superior to his. She is aloo gifted with
Oriental type pe@ience, with LIRING’3"s knowledge, ROWEON has otarted
to make small payments to LIRIRG*4 to provide separate financisl incentive

end help her pay for furniture aod other items she purchased on credit
some time ago.

5. The cketch mentioned in the lest paregreph of RCWTON’s report
dated 26 Kay was retained by thie Station, ROWEOS uscd this sketch to
discuss with LIRING@4 thea layout of LIBING°9"s section. The staterent
made at the end of paragraph 4 of the report dated 27 May fe tn error.
LIRING"9's section has two telephones, What LIAENG<4 took for a third
phone in the back room of that section ie in reality an intercom unit.

2. There de little question that LIRING*3 qt often ask himself
just where his association vith ROWFON is taking him end must speculate
about just what ROWEOM is after. There are obviously times when, left
to conjectures and suppositions, LIRING?3 aust feel like “quitting.”

Yet, the sscendancy gradually developed by ROWFON over LIBING3 hss

reached the point where LIRING?3 is unwilling to go back to the drab, :
uninteresting life he lived before mooting ROWEON. The result of LIBING-3's
“second thoughts” has up to now bean a desire, in the end, to collaborate
even more closely with ROWON, ROWEON's report dated 13 May, and sore
particularly, LIRING©3's scribble attached to thet report, give en indim -
cation of the confusion which exfiete in LIRING@3's mind as a regult of

the contacte he asintaine et KOWFON's urging with the Cubans, Guetemalan
rebels, and various shades of Mexican and Central American leftists,
