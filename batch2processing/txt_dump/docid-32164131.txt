DN 249-C frequented Clover Bar mw xt door. to Sherman Hotel,
Chicago, Illinois, 1946 to 1949. He described this bar as a hangout
for the hoodlum element. At that time it was operated by IRA COLITZ
who was described as a personal friend of Colonel JACOB ARVEY, a well
known Chicago political figure. COLITZ possibly was recently a’
eandidate for Aldermen in Chicago and resides in penthouse apartment
on Michigan Boulevard.

The informant related JACK RUBY, whom he identified from
newspaper photographs, frequented the Clover Bar in about 1946 or
1947 and was an acquaintance of IRA COLITZ and possibly wes a former
school mate of COLITZ on the west side of Chicago. He does not know.
the nature of RUBY's activities in Chicago. .

The informant steted that in about. December, 1949, he was
in 1 Dal 3as, Texas, at which time RUBY was operating a night club,
name unknown, with western band and western motif. The informant.
visited this club and chatted briefly with RUBY who requested that

- he convey RUBY's regards to COLITZ when the informant returned to
Chicago.

The informant has not seen or heard from RUBY since 1949
and has never had any specific information concerning RUBY's back-
ground or sctivities but has never had any reason to ‘suspect him
of being inveived in subversive activities.

CG. 6498-PC was contacted by SA WILLIAM FP. ROEMER, on
11/25/63, but at that time had no personal knowledge of RUBY. On
11/26/63, CG 6408-PC advised that he had solicited information. from
politicians of the 2ith Ward, the former voting residence of RUBY.
PC advised that he talked to two persons who appeared to know RUBY
from many years ago. They advised that RUBY was never anything but
"a punk" end never had any hoodlum connections or associations. One
person advised that he recalls that RUBY attempted to sneak into a>
prize fight in Chicago, believed to be the second DEMPSEY - TUNNEY
fight, and was caught by a police officer who beat him over the head
with his night stick. As a result of this beating, RUBY now has a
plate in his head. Apparently this causes pressure when RUBY becomes
excited and causes RUBY to act emotionally. ; ,
