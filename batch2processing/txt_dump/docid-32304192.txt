CLE BENOIT is subject of Miami closed file
105-7513. He waS last known to be in the Miami area in
1964 and in 1964 moved to Santurce, Puerto Rico where he
was last known to be residing.

 

A review of referenced LHM reflects that most
of the material relates to events that are several years
old. Much of it is set out in the newspaper articles
published by MIKE WALES and these, of course, are a matter
of public record. , KAT /

aa
The only pertinent information which appears
to be current is that relating to an alleged plan to invade
- i) Haiti directed by CLEMENT BENOIT with the help of EDWARD
|] ARTHUR. No information has been received by the Miami
Office which would verify in any way that such a plan is
taking place in this area..

On 3/15/71,[MM 1140-S,]who is well acquainted (¢)
with Haitian exiles in the Miami area,advised that he knew
of no current activity on the part of EDWARD ARTHUR. He
further stated that as far as he knows CLEMENT BENOIT was
living in either Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or
Mexico, and might be teaching school in any of these places.
The source was alerted to furnish any information which
might come to his attention regarding the activities of
BENOIT or ARTHUR.

i
| In view of the above, Miami recommends the
following:

‘1. Referenced Tampa letter and LHM dated 3/11/71
7 emcee

not be dissemin ds

a 2. Miami should contact INS, Miami to determine
f any information in their possession regarding the present
