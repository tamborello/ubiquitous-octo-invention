27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Chancery 15-61-55

Item 295, page 3

“At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet. Enbassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks
DURAN if the american has been there. .
a DURAN: Yes, he is still here.
cae oo SOVIET: According to the letters that. he showed them fron the (Soviet)
; Consulate in Washington, he wants to go.to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the .
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem..
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not. issue the visa here. (in Mexico
City) without. asking Washington. Yet. accordingly . this man
(the American) » “7 Showed him a letter in which ‘he (the
American) is a. member of an organization in favor of Cuba
and said that the Cubans could not give him the visa without
the Russian visa and now the. Soviet doesn't know what to do .
with him,. because he has to wait for the answer from
Washington.

DURAN: ..with them also, ‘because the problem with him (the American)
is that he doesn't know anyone in Cuba and in that case it
is very difficult to give him a visa, because he was
thinking of processing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take a long time waiting for the Russian visa in

. Cuba, and.then go on to the USSR.
SOVIET: ..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were
* now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now
or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is: “going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can, communicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or.in any other place (he) can

.: receive it, but right now they do not-have them.

DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter -
because they do not. know if the visa will be approved.

“SOVIET: ' They can only give the visa according to instructions.

DURAN: Then that is what she will put on his application. ;

‘SOVIET:. Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because

; I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

- DURAN: It was no bother, thank you very much.

SUBJECT: OSWALD contacts with Cuban and, Soviet ‘Embassies, Mexico ,
' . . City, Mexico, during the period 27 September 1963 to 1 October .
* 1963 Lo . _ .
1. ODESSA Calls.
2. OSWALD Calls.

3. Original Transcripts.

FINDINGS: _

1. Calls concerning travel to ODESSA. Three .calls were made in

‘the Spanish language on 27 September 1963 concerning travel to Odessa.

The first call was made about 1040 hours to the Soviet Military Attache
Office.. An unidentified man outside asks the Soviet Military Attache
what is needed to get a visa to go to Odessa. The Soviet tells him to

‘call 15-60-55 and ask for the consul. The man outside asks for the

address: which the Soviet provides. 1/ The second call was made about

' 1037 hours to the Consulate of the Soviet Embassy (15-60-55). An unidentified

man asks for the consul and is told that he is not.there. The unidentified
man asks what is needed to get a visa to go to Odessa and is told to call
back at ‘1130 hours. 2/ The third call occurred at 1235 hours. A man.

: mamed ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) inside the Soviet Consulate (15-60-55) called

out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial America, probably a pension or hotel but

‘not listed. in the telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN °

ROMAN. ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

. know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the Soviets

will also need copies of the passenger manifest. (The conversation suggests
that ALATRISTE and. SAN ROMAN were shipping representatives of the boat
“KALONIA"). 2/° There is nothing in either of the calls to suggest any
connection with OSWALD. There is evidence that the calls were not related
‘to OSWALD: ‘a) in-OSWALDS's contacts with Cuban dnd Soviet officials he made
no effort to communicate in Spanish. though he appeared to have difficulty
with both English and Russian, thus one concludes that he could not speak
Spanish, .All three calls about Odessa were in fluent Spanish. b) Marina

OSWALD in her letter to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. (reproduced in

the Warren Commission Report) asked specifically to go to Lenningrad and

_ made no.mention of Odessa.

Item. 74, page 2

An unidentified man ‘(spesking Spanish) calls the Soviet“ ‘Eibassy

Consulate at 1037 hours’ and asks for the Consul. He is told that

the Consul’ is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to gO to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item: 137, page _ 2

At 1235 hours a man. named ‘ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
‘ Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72. (Colonial . ~
- America, probably. a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

--. ALATRISTE<Says, that he’ is-in the-Russian Embassy: and-they-need to”
know: what ‘day. the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Sovii CS. wild’ also need copies of” the passenger manifest....

” (one. concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping representatives
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa information. First

a call was made to the "first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the

. Mexican telephone directory (which turned out to be the Military Attache).
They got~the phone number for the Consulate and the address. After
_making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

information.) .

Item 395, pages 7 and 8

. Just. after 1600: hours; the Soviet Consulate ‘received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN. wants to know.with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

_. because ‘she sent. him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
". approved the visa then the Cubans would: give him one without anything
_. more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
“ to-know with whom he spoke because he sdys that he doesn't know
“either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
. be no'problem. The Soviet asks DURAN-to wait a minute. After a
‘short wait. DURAN explains the same thing.to another Soviet. This
Soviet. tells ‘her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will. return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
Number 11-28-47 then says as a pérsonal . thing, ‘she has moved and -
_has not advised them of a change of. address so.will ‘not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call”
KOUKHARENKO in order. to change that address and asks for the name -
-: of -the (Cuban). Cultural Attache. -:DURAN says it -is- ‘Teresa PROENZA
7 whose number: is 14-13- 26. The Soviet thanks her. . ;

d) At 1031-hours on 1- October 1963, a man trying to speak
Russian called the Soviet Embassy Military Attache Office:

' . and -said he was at their Embassy "last Saturday" (28 September)

and talked with the Consul.. He is told to call the number for
the Consulate and to write it down. 6/ -

'e) At 1035 hours on 1 October 1963, a man (whose voice was
described by the. translator as the same person as above) called

the Soviet Embassy Consulate. He said this is LEE OSWALD, I was -
at your place last Saturday and spoke with a Consul who said they
would send-a telegram to Washington, so I want to find out if you
have anything. He did not remember the name of the Consul. The
Soviet suggested it was KOSTIKOV, then told the caller that a —
telegram had gone out but nothing had-been received. 7/

2. ‘There were five telephone calls to or from the Soviet —

Embassy’ in Mexico City which (after 22 November 1963) were linked to ,
OSWALD for the period 27 September 1963 to 1 October 1963:

a) Shortly after 1600 hours on 27 September 1963 the Soviet
Embassy, Mexico City, received a call from Sylvia DURAN, a Mexican

employee . in the Cuban Consulate, Mexico City. DURAN had a’ North-

american in her office and wanted to know who he talked with at
the Soviet Embassy. She had sent him there for a Soviet visa -
after which the Cubans would issue one to him. DURAN was told to ©
leave a number for someone to return the call. . She gave the -
Soviets the number of the Cuban Consulate: 3/. __ ae

fOne concludes from this conversation that. this Northamerican,:
later identified by DURAN as OSWALD, went. first. to the Cuban
Embassy on 27 September, then to the Soviet Embassy, and ~
returned to. the Cuban Embassy when DURAN made the first - -call.) :

‘b) 6At 1626 hours ‘on 27 September a Soviet male in the Soviet:
Embassy, Mexico City, returned the call to DURAN at the Cuban |

Embassy and asked if the Northamerican had been there and was told
that he was still there (at the Cuban Embassy). The Soviet told
DURAN that the Northamerican had shown them letters with their. -
Consulate in Washington requesting a visa for himself and his
wife. but the process: takes.4 to 5 months. and they (the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico) have no authorization to issue.a visa to him -
and furthermore they (the Soviet Embassy in Mexico) do not know
anything about him and cannot give him a letter of recommendation
to go to Cuba (enroute to the USSR). ‘DURAN says that in ‘that case

che vcannot -be issued a visa to Cuba either (until he receives
Permission to go on. to the USSR). 4/ :

9) Shortly: before 1200 hours on 28 September 1963. the Soviet
Embassy Consulate, Mexico City, received a call from Sylvia.

DURAN who said she had there in "their" Consulate, the Northamerican
who had been to the Soviet Embassy. The Northamerican. talks with
the Soviet in English and Russian saying he was: "just now" at your ~
Embassy and they "took his address" but he didn't know it.then and
went back to the Cuban Embassy to get it. The Soviet tells him to

‘come back to. the Soviet Bmbassy « The Northamerican 1 agrees to do so.
right. away. 5/

(One concludes ‘from this conversation that OSWALD went to the Soviet
Embassy before 1200 hours on 28 September, then to the Cuban Embassy

‘where the call was made, then returned to the Soviet Embassy: some =

time after 1200 hours the same day. )
