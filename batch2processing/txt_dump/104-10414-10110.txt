There was one indication that the Soviets were seeking
out the LIMITED photo basehouse apd may have had suspicions concerning
LIEMPTY-6. This was a report by ADAGE -10 that in mid-1966 Stanislav
Sergeyevich Silnikov (201-271103), a Soviet Embassy guard, askeg KDADAGE
10 to report on his neighbors near the Soviet Embassy. Silnikov expressed
interest in all the occupants of the new apartment building which houses the

e2z(KDABSINTHE photo basehouse, but did not mention the KDABSINTHE base-

house keepers by name, Silnikov did name specific persons he was inter-
ested in and these included LIEMPTY-6°“KDADAGE-10, of unknown
reliability, said he did not give Silnikov any information, but added that,
between himself and the Station, he suspected LIEMPTY-6 and had heard

it rumored he worked for the Americans, In 1966 Headquarters already
assumed the Soviets were aware of the LIMITED basehouse because it was
used for radio direction of the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance. In any case,
the Soviets apparently took no action prior to the closing of the LIMITED
basehouse and the relocation of LIEMPTY-6 in May 1968. It is believed
this incident has no implications that would threaten the security of current

(KDFACTOR assets.

included GERENDE, who apparently became a Specific target of Soviet
investigation, It is unclear from the report of the Federal Security Police
how far the Soviet investigation of GERENDE had proceeded, Nechiporenko
was PNG'‘d from Mexico in March 1971, GERENDE’s possible exposure to
the Soviets could have been through his work on the Olympic Committee as
a translator or through his work for the Station, which used him for a wide
range of support tasks against the Soviet and Cuban targets.

&DFACTOR-7 is a Dutch citizen and the former wife of
GERENDE. She returned to the Netherlands in July 1970 with her children.
She had served as a support agent assisting GERENDE. She is believed
witting, in general terms, of GERENDE's activities regarding the &DEACTOR
Project. She was terminated on 26 June 1970)8ha signed both a secrecy
agreement and quit claim, After termination it became apparent that she
had considerable hard feelings toward both the Agency and GERENDE over
financial problems between her family and GERENDE, While the Station
was not directly involved in all the financial problems, the Station was
involved in regard to her divorce claims against GERENDE's salary, a
large part of which came covertly from the Station. In July 1970 @DEACTOR-'
came to the Agency Headquarters and complained about her financial settle-
ment, In September and November 1970 she wrote two letters directly to
the Agency on the same subject. In late 1970 she also asked a Hague Embassy
political officer to put her in contact with the Agency; however, she did not
tell him the nature of her business, In January 1971 the Agency contacted
KDF ACTOR-7 's brother, a U. S. Army civilian with a "Top Secret" clearance
living in Alexandria, J/irginia, and was able to resolve the financial mis~
understandings with(KDFACTOR-7. In January i ee iS-G

4, Terminated Agents Possibly Affecting Present Project Security:
A. Raymond H, GERENDE

GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and was a contract agent
until his termination,on 26 June 1970"? He had been employed by the Station
intérmittently since 1965)and was used almost exclusively in support activities,
Since the start of the LIEMPTY Project in 1959) ERENDE had been directly
involved with this project serving as cutout to thé basehouses, carrying and
processing films, and giving general direction to the project as principal
agent. In 1969)“after years of excellent service with the Station, GERENDE
had serious marital problems which ended in separation from his wife,

o2{KDFACTOR-7, From December 1969)fo June 1%70)GERENDE was not used

operationally but was maintained on half pay-with the hope the divorce pro-
ceedings would be completed quickly. When it became apparent the divorce
would drag on interminably, the Station reluctantly terminated GERENDE
and his wife. Bruce H. FERNALD, caregr agent, met with GERENDE
monthly from July 1970) through May 197) While paying him his termination
bonus in ten installments. GERENDE is still living in Mexico City, where
he owns some property and has an income as an English teacher to employees
of two local firms. He visited his wife and children in Holland in December
1970. It appears he may now be financially pressed as his English class
schedule has been cut back, The Station as of 10 April 1972) ad no informa-
lion that would indicate GE RENDE has violated his secrecy agreement,

There is an indication that GERENDE came to the attention
of the Soviets in 1968. A Mexican walk-in to the FBI office in Mexico City,
who was later interrogated by the Federal Security Police in 1970, said
that in 1968 he had been employed by the Soviet Embassy Second Secretary,

Oleg Masksimovich Nechiporenko (201-305870), to investigate persons

working with the Mexican Olympic Committee. The persons investigated
of this project, but that seems unlikely from the Headquarters
review of terminated agents witting of presen FACTOR
operational activities. A Soviet investigation of property owner-
ship around the Soviet Embassy and their awareness that the
Soviet Embassy was under photographic surveillance in the past
could result in a Soviet investigation of the activities and contacts
@i(KDABBEY-1, the owner of an apartment building and four,
houses close to the Soviet Embassy. It is doubtful that QKDABBE Y- I's
activities, which do not inter-relate with the activities of the
KDFACTOR agents, would in any way expose the GF ACTOR
Project operational activities. |

2. A brief history of the(KDF ACTOR Project:

The(KDFACTOR Project had its origins in the LIJERSEY
and LIPSTICK Projects, both active in the mid-1950}g. In 1959)"after

the arrest of two LIPSTICK surveillance team members, it was decided

to break off the more sensitive, uncompromised LIPSTICK assets manning
and supporting two basehouses for photo surveillance of the Soviet Embassy.
These assets were consolidated with one photo basehouse against the Soviet
Embassy and one surveillance team from the LIJERSEY Project into a new
project (LIEMPTY), which was approved on 16 January 1969.0¢The LIEMPTY
Project, renamed the @DF ACTOR Project in 197)}9 ‘consisted of three photo
basehouses, two viewing the front of the Soviet Embassy (LIMITED and
LILYRIC) and one viewing the rear garden of the Soviet Embassy (LICALLA).
plus a mobile surveillance team (LIENTRAP) tied closely with the LIMITED
basehouse, which was the radio control point for dispatch of the LIENTRAP.

ef
In 169 the LIENTRAP surveillance vehicle and two team

members were arrested at the scene of a Cuban demonstration in Mexico
City. A Station review of the security implications of this incident stated
that it did not materially affect the security of the project nor expose any

of the LIEMPTY basehouse operations, (Note: As the basehouse operations
were comparimented, the only exposure possible from this incident would
have been of the LIMITED baschouse, which is no longer in existence. )

-The LIEMPTY Project operated substantially as above until
the Warren Commission report was published in late 1964, In this publica-
tion was a picture of a person entering the Soviet Embassy taken from the
LIMITED basehouse. The LIMITED photo basehouse wa's closed in Sept-
ember 1964, and all photographic surveillance was suspended as a.security
precaution. In January 1965 the LIMITED basehouse was relocated, and

In response to reference the following is a summary of the

02.
The Station summary of ne@odxcton Project security is
as follows:

"There were no known problems of security relating to
the Project.: In response to the Headquarters request, we have
reviewed all phases of the operation and believe that Project
security is sound, The Project assets have all been with us for
many years and have established themselves as respectable long-
time residents of the area. All five assets, four in one family
and one in another, are extremely security conscious and have
all been SGSWIRLED, The assets derive a substantial portion
of their livelihood from their Agency employment and would thus
lose a great deal if security factors ever necessitated a termina-
tion of their work for us, As an additional safeguard, the

LITE RAL ahd(KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from each other, and there has never been any indication that
either segment of(KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence".

o& The Headquarters desk has also reviewed the security of the

(SDF ACTOR Project and agrees with the saree that the security

is sound, In fact, as presently constituted, the(KDF ACTOR
Project is well cpmpartmented, and each of the two &DE. CTOR

term assets who draw a minimum of suspicion in their operational

later that year the building it had previously been in was razed by the
owner “fk ABBEY-1. From 1964 on it must be assumed that the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City believes it is under regular photographic sur-
veillance.

. Further project changes took place in 1966 when the LILYRIC
basehouse was relocated to another apartment with approximately the’
same view. In May 1968 the LIMITED basehouse was terminated and
LIEMPTY-6, the basehouse keeper, retired. This affected the LIENTRAP
coverage of Soviet vehicular movement monitored and directed from the
LIMITED basehouse. With the closing of LIMITED and the Station decision
to replace Raymond H. GERENDE, Mexican national contract agent who
handled the LIEMPTY Project since its inception, the LIENTRAP mobile
surveillance team was underemployed, and the decision was made to move
it to the LIEMBRACE Project. This was done in early 1970)"soon after
GERENDE had been relieved of operational responsibilities in December
1969, :

compartmentation have been: (a) the LIMITED basehouse was linked to
the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance; (b)*&DF ACTOR-1 was processing
films from all the basehouses and could, therefore, be aware, of their
exact locations; (c) GERENDE was aware of all aspects of tiie GDFACTOR
