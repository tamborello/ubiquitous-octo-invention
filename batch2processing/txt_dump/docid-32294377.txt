III. LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE

Re: Miami Pest Control
Miami, Florida

TP T-2 on February 8, 1962, indicated that
ANGELO BRUNO and his brother-in-law, RALPH MARANCA,
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, had discussed SANTO,
who was in Miami, Florida, that BRUNO knew SANTO had
no legitimate means of support, and that they, BRUNO
and SANTO, considered getting many customers on Miami f
Beach and in Miami, for an extermination business. The
business would be Miami Pest Control, registered in
Miami; and BRUNO was desirous of getting a man with a
college degree in business administration to head the company,
having complete control of the company. Source indicated,
however, that BRUNO had difficulties in placing his plans-
into operation in Miami as apparently the man with the
college degree did not want any part of any illegitimate
deal and had to be assured by BRUNO that they, BRUNO and
SANTO, were more interested in running the-business
legitimately than even the college degree man, noting
the college man need only hire men to do the work and
that BRUNO and SANTO could get all the customers. Sub-
sequently, the college man apparently saw SANTO's, VITO's
and ALBERT's pictures in a newspaper; and when BRUNO
contacted the college man on a trip to Miami, the
college man indicated his family did not want any deal
with BRUNO and SANTO.
