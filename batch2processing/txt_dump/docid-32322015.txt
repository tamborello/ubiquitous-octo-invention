Title: PROCUREMENT OF ASSASSINATION RECORD REVIEW
AND CLASSIFICATION CONSULTATION SERVICES

Synopsis: It is requested that the services of Carl Valentine be
extended for 60 days from October 1, 1997 through November 30,
1997. National Security Division (NSD) should review the issues

to decide if consultants are needed to manage the additional 4
mre Bhp GZo5 17.

Details: The Historical and Executive Review Unit (HERU) is
responsible for transferring FBI records covered by the
“President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act
of 1992" (the Act) to the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA). The Act also included the establishment
of an independent Presidential Review Board to oversee the
identification and release of records until October 1997.
However, President Clinton recently signed legislation
authorizing a one-year extension for the Board. This gives the
Board an additional year till October 1, 1998 to complete their
mission. To date more than 666,000 pages have been transferred
to NARA and at least 180,000 currently identified pages remain to
be finished by that deadline.

Additionally, HERU manages the responsibilities of the
Historical Declassification Review Team (HDRT). A Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between the FBI and Department of Justice
(DOJ) established the HDRT when the Executive Order (E.0.)12958
was signed. The MOU gave the FBI an exception of automatic
declassification, since E.O. 12958 established an automatic
declassification for documents over 25-years old unless an agency

could justify an exemption of their records. As defined in the
-MOU the HDRT. systematically reviews FBI documents and files for
classification/declassification of information deemed to be of
historical interest. The systematic review is also time and
volume. driven, because the review is scrutinized by Associate
Deputy Attorney General (ADAG) Roslyn A. Mazer. The ADAG's
proposal and opinion is that if the FBI's systematic review is
not up to DOJ's standards. then the FBI should move to a bulk
declassification, since “disclosure of 50-year old techniques
used during and prior to World War II would not appreciably
affect today's national security and if there were a few isolated
instances of sensitive disclosures, this might be a fair price to
pay for bulk declassification.” The opinion continues with
extending this review to material dated up to 1964 with possibly
a sample review for bulk declassification.

‘ The Act and E.O. 12958 both provide criteria for
restricting certain information in records sent to'’NARA so it. is
‘not open for. public inspection. One basis for the restriction is
the demonstrated. need. to.continue to classify. specific. .
_information. To meet both Mandates, HERU is attempting to reduce
the amount of postponed information in part by declassifying
information whenever there would not be any damage to the
national security or FBI operational interests. As already noted
in this communication, both document review projects are subject
to time constraints and high visibility. Therefore, it is
imperative that HERU have operational opinions on a timely and
daily basis. ; :

‘The records being reviewed by HERU under the Act and E.
O. 12958 (i.e., CPUSA, VENONA, surveillance on foreign embassies,
etc.) contain a great deal of classified information, relating
chiefly to Russian, Cuban, other foreign counter intelligence
countries, and information gained through intelligence collection
on allied countries. To classify/declassify issues related to.
the Act and the E.O. 12958, consultation has been necessary with
individuals having the institutional knowledge of national
security issues and operations. Mr. Valentine has performed
these duties over the past three years with three other former
NSD employees, who are no longer available. Mr. Valentine's
previous national security investigative knowledge and the
experience of working on classification matters with this unit
maintained his prior contacts with the operational division.
Currently, he continues to have easy access to the appropriate
contacts when the opinion of the NSD is required.

Beyond the background in NSD, Mr. Valentine assisted in

making the contacts and setting up meetings with Department of
4 " State (DOS) senior officials. These contacts were necessary in

determining the status of foreign relations with certain
countries before the FBI could declassify investigative
information according to the MOU between the FBI and DOS. The
opinion of DOS was important since the material to be released
concerned national security investigations and could have
affected foreign relations. This is another example of the types
of issues HERU will continue to see in the relevant material.

The unit will need someone with the appropriate
understanding and contacts to decide the classification under the
Act and E.O. 12958. Mr. Valentine has the experience and vast
knowledge in FCI matters and the legislation concerning
classification matters. Beyond the duties mentioned, he consults
with the Office of General Counsel, NSD, and the Litigation Unit
in OPCA on the issue damage and writes the evidence to be
presented to DOJ's Departmental Review Committee. This knowledge
would ‘be very difficult to duplicate and qualifies him as an
expert for the review of this material. In addition, having the
services of Mr. Valentine will permit the unit to meet its
deadlines and not cause any new burdens or distractions from the
ongoing operational investigations in NSD.

Due to the time constraints placed on HERU under the
Act and E.O. 12958 and Mr. Valentine's unequivocal institutional
knowledge, it is imperative that Mr. Valentine's contract be
extended 60 days. Therefore, it is requested that
Mr. Valentine's consultation services be contracted for 60
additional days (10/1/97-11/30/97) at his current hourly rate.
The amount to be budgeted to cover the 60 days is $21,000.

HERU also requests NSD to provide a consultant or
possibly more than one for the 1998 fiscal year to manage all the
national security concerns. This next year will be crucial in
complying with the Act and meeting DOJ's standards. It will be
necessary to have at least one consultant available for the
issues listed above.
