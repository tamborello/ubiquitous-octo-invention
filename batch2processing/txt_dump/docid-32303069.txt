SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka.,-
AR

on 2/28/61, SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III, observed GABRIEL MANNARINO's
cottage, located on Old Leechburg Road, R. D. #3, Leechburg, Pa.,
and it appears as though construction is completed. This means
the: cottage now has five rooms: three bedrooms, a living room -
dining room, and a kitchen; and it also has a fairly large
screened porch. Nobody was noted in the area, and no cars were
observed in the driveway or parking area, but the three German
shepeerd dogs were in the outdoor pen to the rear and right of
the cottage. No telephone line was observable, and rel
cc , who lives across the road from the cottage was not
available for interview.

 

Because of previously set forth information to the effect that
GABRIEL MANNARINO spends considerable time at this cottage, has
many visitors at odd hours of the night, and may move into it
;| a permanent residence, Pittsburgh plans to make every effort t
establish whether or not highly confidential coverage can be ef-
fected there.
