Memorandum from William E. Baugh, Jr., to Mr. Coyle, dated 7/27/95
Re: Judy O'Hara

John F. Kennedy Task Force (JFKTF)

Information Resources Division
62-HQ-1029205

 

NAME SOCIAL SECURITY # PRESENT GRADE
Judy O'Hara 182-400-5821 GS-11

Ms. O'Hara is doing complex document review work
consistent with the duties set forth in the GS-12 position to
which she is being recommended for term promotion. Others with
background and experience similar to hers on the JFKTF were
similarly promoted by the 9/13/94 memorandum.
