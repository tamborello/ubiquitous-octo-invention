Letter to Los Angeles
RE: WALTER HENRYK DUDA
105-111366

instigated the charges concerning cement production in order

to put pressure upon him; that in March, 1960, subject may have
agreed to cooperate with the PIS and that in April, 1960, the
charges were disposed of by dropping the serious charges,
sentencing him to six months on a minor charge and giving him two
years probation as a further hold over him. This reconstruction
of what may have happened is, of course, merely tentatives. 5)

Subject was reportedly in prison from April until
October, 1960, and yet he wrote at least one letter to Mrs. Stowe
during this period. If he was not cooperating with the PIS,
it seems unlikely that he would have been permitted to send a
letter from prison to a person in the U. S. with whom he was
negotiating to get out of Poland. (3)

On 10/22/61 subject stated the U. S. Embassy had asked
him to apply for Poli&Sh passports for himself and his family
and on 11/13/61 he said their passports had been obtained. Since
the normal waiting period for Polish passports is four months for
persons with clear records, it appears that there must have been
some intervention on his hehalf in order for him to obtain these
passports Se: quickly. (ce

 

The information developed thus far tends to indicate
that the subject is identical with the individual named by
CSNY 3581-S. The evidencing of anticommunist sympathies by the
subject since his arrival in the U. S. is merely what might be
e recruited PIS agent. This case may present,
therefore, an excellent opportunity to penetrate Polish
intelligence. ——""_—">_ (a)

SUBJECT: WALTER HENRYK DUDA
Is = PO

Re San Diego report of 11/13/62.

The fact that Mrs, Gardner Stowe,who assisted
subject to come to the U. 5.,has retained all of his
letters to her may be very helpful in this case, It could
probably be presumed that the subject's correspondence was
examined at least on some occasions by the Polish Intelligence
Service (PIS), On 11/16/59 the subject mentioned in one of
his letters that it would be easy to get an entry permit
(into the U. 5S.) from Germany; his statements in this letter
may have indicated that he was considering an escape or
illegal departure from Poland and may have alerted the
PIS to take action concerning him, On 4/25/60 he was
sentenced by the Polish Court to six months' imprisonment
and two years' probation for producing substandard cement.
The investigation of the subject with respect to this
charge undoubtedly covered several yeeks preceding 4/25/60,
It will be recalled that CSNY 3581-S reported that subject
was recruited by the PIS about 3/20/60. It appears quite
possible that between November, 1959, and March, 1960, the
PIS may have studied his case}; that the matter was brought
to a head when he received notice from the U. S. Embassy
in Warsaw on 3/2/60 that favorable action was anticipated
on his U. S, visa application; that the PIS thereupon

ESPIONAGE ~ R

Reurlet 1/11/63 advising that UACB the
program would be resumed on 2/5/63 in your office
and would operate on a five-day basis from Tuesday
through Saturday.

A review of this file shows that this
program has been operating in your office since August,
1861, with the exception of the Christmas periods of
1961 and 1962, To date, no Soviet illegal agents have
been identified or located as a result of your operation.
In view of the heavy demands placed on the espionage
” squad of your office as set out in your airtel of 11/15/62
and in view of the unproductivity of the operation to
date, the Bureau feels that it should not be reinstituted
in your office. You should continue thé-i igation of
any cases currently pending in your office which arose
from Sam Survey and attempt to bring them to a logical
conclusion,

Letter to Los Angeles
RE: WALTER HENRYK DUDA
105-111366

San Diego should endeavor to obtain copies of all
of subject's letters to Mrs, Stowe in order that the exact
statements of the subject and the pertinent dates will be
available for preparation éf the eventual interview with
him. Some plausible reason for wanting this correspondence
can be given to Mrs, Stowe as for example that it may give
an interesting insight into conditions in Poland during this
period. Ce

If he has been recruited, the subject is possibly
not yet operational but he may be communicating with his
principal in Poland through a mail drop in Poland.

Los Angeles should immediately submit its recommendation
regarding mail cover on subject. When subject is interviewed,
he should be questioned about his relatives and friends and
what reports he has received from them concerning
developments in Poland since his departure. If he fails to
volunteer information concerning one of his correspondents,
it may be an indication that this is his mail drop. fs)

It is noted that in a letter to Mrs, Stowe on
9/25/58 the subject stated that he was not a member of the
Polish Communist Party (PZPR), but admitted membership in
October, 1960, when applying for a U. S. visa. When the
subject is interviewed the circumstances of his joining the
PZPR should be explored. s

New York should promptly furnish results of its
further contact with CSNY 3581-5,
