_ and. although he considers him capable of such an act, he does
not believe FLANERY would become involved in any hijacking
inasmuch as FLANERY has "too much to lose" in connection with
the building and construction business. Informant recalled
that FLANERY's name had also been mentioned in connection with

_the hijacking of the Pennsylvania Club in 1963 when it was being
operated by GEORGE BARNES. Informant said BARNES had talked
to FLANERY at that time ahd had eliminated him as a suspect.

Informant stated that he too has been accused of
having a part in the attempted hijacking of the Canadian
Country Club, possibly because he is a former employee and™

is presently "somewhat at odds" with FLETCHER HANDLEY, owner
of the Canadian Country Club. Informant talked to GEORGE -
BARNES and JUNK JOHNSTON the previous week and is certain he*
convinced them that he had no part in the attempted hijacking.
(BARNES and’ JOHNSON operate the gambling room at the Canadian
Country Club.) .

Informant said that BARNES uses’R, p OMATHENS, a
Dallas, Texas, hoodlum, as a strong-arm man but that to
informant's knowledge, MATHEW has not been in Qklahoma City
recently. Jy ;

| Informant said Saat FLETCHER HANDLEY uses BED

‘HOLT and GEORGEAPOULOS"&: Tong-arm men, (HOLT is an™
‘Oklahoma City hoodlum and POULOS.is a hoodlum in Wichita,
Kansas.) . : ;

On 3/15/64, OC 374-C advised SA HAROLD E. DUNCAN.
that FLETCHER HANDLEY continues to operate the Canadian |,
oa: Country lub avd is assisted in that business by his Mrother A
Seer CHARLESXHANDLEY. CI. stated he had heard that GEORG‘ BARNES ol\\\e .
is now employed at the club as a dealer and that customers .
of the club continue to be local people from the vicinity
of Oklahoma City. . 0
