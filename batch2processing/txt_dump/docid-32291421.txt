On September 12, 1962, Captain RAYMOND WATERS, Texas :
Rangers, Lubbock, advised he does not believe there has been any
increase ‘in gambling in the areaaround Lubbock during recent L
years. He said there have been a few permanent residents who

do nothing but gamble for a living, but the games are not regular
and are not held in any permanent location. He continued that
gamblers hold card or dice games in hotel and motel rooms, and
occasionally in an office such as a cotton broker's office. He

‘said that usually a number of them will play with a very few
(sometimes only one) "pigeon."' He stated it appears’ that they
telephone "pigeons" and invite them to a game, giving the location,
and therefore it is not necessary for them to have a permanent

  
   

 

  

 

location. “

. He said he considered CECIL EUGENE HARRIS the mos t, |
active local gambler and the only one who might be suspected
of having. bookiiuaicing contacts in Dallas or elsewhere.
“
DL T-16 ‘advised on January 4, 1963, that he considered
BILL ‘WATSON the most active gambler in the Lubbock area at the a
present time. He advised on February 25, 1962, that gambling in
Lubbock had been quiet and was mainly card and dice games.
