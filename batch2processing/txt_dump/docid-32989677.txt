SENATE SELECT COMMITTER ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Item 1 B requests any materials reflecting or establishing
the aforementioned memoranda were delivered to and/or returned by
the Attorney General. ‘The “yellow copies of these memoranda, in
the lower left hand corner, contain a stamp indicating the time and
the date the originals were sent to the Attorney General from the
Office of the Director. The original memoranda of Hay 17, 1965,
aud December 1, 1965, bear what appear to be the initials of the
then Attormey General Nicholas dé B. Katzenbach, in the upper right
hand corner. On the December 1, 1965, original memorandum the
date December 10, 1965, also appeara indicating that memorandum was
xetelved by the Attorney Genexal on that date. The original of the
October 19, 1965, memorandum contains the initial of an unldentified
individual apparently assigned in the office of the Attorney General
at that time.

The date and time stamps appearing on the reverse side
of the original May 17, 1965, memorandum indicate that document was
returned to the FBI by the Attorney General on May 19, 1965, The
gseverse sidésof the oxviginal memoranda dated October 19, 1965, and
December 1, 1965, bear no such date and time stamp.

; Item 1 G requested a copy of the reverse side of the
"transmittal slip" containing the December 10, 1965, note from the
then Attorey General to the Director. For purpose of easy identi-
fication, both sides of that document, the front of which was
previously furnished tha SSC, ave being made available.

Item 2 of the SSC's request pertains to the delivery
of pertinent materials obtained from logical files and serials in
determining whether vacious meetings and/or telephone conversations
involving the Presideut, the Director, The Attormey General ond other
Bureau officials, in whole or in part, pertained to the electronic
surveillances of Martin Luther King, Jv., the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) or the President's June 30, 1965,
lmemorandum, captioned ‘Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments
and Agencies," concerning electronic survalllances.

dn exhaustive search of logical Files and serials, in-
eluding abstracts of the Diractor and former Assistant to the
Dicactor Cartha Deloach, failed to locate information pertaining
to conversations and/or meetings of these individuals with the
President or representatives of the Department of Justice on dates
sek forth in the §Sc's request. This scarch resulted in the
