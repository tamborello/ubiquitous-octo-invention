JOHN FELICE can give the orders to PRESSER, Although his
salary is not known to the informant, he feels certain that
PRESSER does not make the big money that many people attribute
to him. PRESSER does not have any income outside of his union
money as far as he knows,

His wife, FAYE PRESSER, was just in Mt. Sinai Hospital
several weeks ago for a rest. She goes into the hospital about
twice a year for this purpose. She still is a big gambler,
goes big for the horses and just as big for cards. She has
been nabbed a couple times while participating in a couple of
"RED" MASON's poker games, where other women players took part
in these games set up by MASON,

ALLEN FRIEDMAN, FAYE's brother, does some gambling,
but not like his/brother, HARRY, who is.a-real "horse degen-
erate." He follows the horses all over the country. He does
not attend the local area tracks very much, He has’ said that

-around here he could fix one jockey, but then there are other

guys who would be: fixing two or three jockeys in the same race.
Informant believed-that he has been. at the California tracks
during this past winter and may still be out there. TOBY
PRESSER, HARRY FRIEDMAN's daughter, who with her brother were
adopted by the PRESSERs, will be getting married shortly to a
Jewish fellow who drives a truck on some type of business
route,

JACKIE PRESSER is in the vending machine business

with an uncle, MILTON PRESSER. They are doing well financially.

This is one of the few occasions on which WILLIAM PRESSER has

allowed anybody to use his name and union connection. ‘He has

allowed JACKIE to mention in his vending machine contacts that
his father heads up the Teamsters in this area, and would like
to see his son do well in the business.
