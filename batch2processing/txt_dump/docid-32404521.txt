MEMORANDUM FOR: “Assassination Records Review
Board

 

 
 

FROM: ‘° ’ "John F. Pereira :
° Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: a Government’ Information

(We request that this memorandum be returned to CIA once the
Board has completed. its deliberations on _the issues discussed
below.) é

 

 

1. 9) Issue: This memorandum will address CIA's position
on the review and declassification of ,foreign government
information that appears in the JFK collection. This issue has
come to CIA's attention because of the recent review by the JFK.
Board of documents. The Agency believes it is
important to address this issue at,/this time because this is the
first instance that this type of,foreign liaison document has
been reviewed by the Board and it’ is possible that such ;
information will appear again in’ CIA's collection. This memo
will, therefore, focus on the larger issue of a United States
Government (USG) agency's legal obligations in the dissemination
and declassification of foreign government_information but will

also address the specific igsue of the documents."
(documents:

2. ABT Conclusion: , CIA does not object to the releasé of the
information in these documents, but is only concerned about ,
protecting foreign government information. Therefore, the Agency
does not object to the release of the four CIA documents in the
redacted form proposed by the Board. With regards to the two

the Agency has no authority to unilaterally
agree to their release in any form. Pursuant to its legal
obligations, CIA ordinarily seeks the consent of the foreign
government prior to declassifying their information. However,

3. (U) Legal Authorities: The procedures governing the
declassification and dissemination of foreign government
information are set out in Executive Order 12958, as well as
Director of Central Intelligence Directives (DCIDs). Executive
Order 12958 defines foreign government information as including
(1) information provided by a foreign government, or any element
thereof, with the expectation, expressed or implied, that the
information and/or the source of the information, are to be held
in confidence; or (2) information produced by the United States
pursuant to or as a result of a joint arrangements with a foreign
government, or any element thereof, requiring that the
information, the arrangements, or both, are to be held in
confidence. Id., at §1.1(d) ’

4, (U) Foreign government information is subject to a
classification determination under E.O. 12958, section 1.5(c).
When so classified, U.S. government agencies are obligated to
protect that information from unauthorized disclosure. The E.O.
requires that foreign government information shall either retain
its original classification or be assigned a U.S. classification
that shall ensure a degree of protection at least equivalent to
that required by the entity that furnished the information. Id.,
at 1.7(e). Furthermore, agencies are required to safeguard
foreign government information under standards that provide a
degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the
originating government. Id., at 4.2(g).

5. (U) Pursuant to his authority as head of the
intelligence community to protect all classified information from
unauthorized disclosure, the Director of Central Intelligence has
issued Directives (that is, DCIDs) setting out the procedures for
the declassification and dissemination of foreign government
information. Intelligence obtained from another government or
from a combined effort with another government, may not be
released or authorized for release without its consent. DCID 5/6
attachment § C.3. Furthermore, the release of intelligence that
would be contrary to agreements between the U.S. and foreign
countries is expressly prohibited. Id., at c.5.

 

6. (U) Finally, the very fact of intelligence cooperation
between the U.S. and specifically named foreign countries and
government components is classified SECRET unless a different
classification is mutually agreed upon. DCID 1/10-1. Such
information may be declassified only with the mutual consent of.
the U.S. and the foreign government whose interests are involved.
DCID 1/10-1.

5. On the other hand, CIA could use this situation as a
way to highlight the problems HRG has had with the JFK review
‘process - that documents are being reviewed and released to the
National Archives in such quantity and’speed that it is difficult
for CIA to focus on any one document and, more importantly, how
seemingly innocuous information in one document can actually be
quite significant in relation to prior or subsequent releases.
Since September, when this cable was originally released, the
issue of protecting iMexican Viaison has become increasingly
important because of other releases on this subject and because
of your appearance before the Board in February.

6. Furthermore, this prior release should’ not impair our
ability to continue to protect the fact of Méxican involvement: in
this tel-tap operation Although we ed 2d_to the Board’ o\m

their arguments to continue to protect the liaison relationship.

7. Our only recourse is to acknowledge to the Board that
CIA has no basis to bring an appeal to the President since this
cable has already been released in full. » We should, however,
maintain our position that we believe thirs - information, vis
damaging especially in light of releases to National Archives

*, and that we never would have acquiesced to the

release in September if we knew then what would be released on
this subject in the ensuing months. Although this message does
not necessarily need to be conveyed by you to Tunheim and could
be handled by John’ Pereira and David Marwell, given your past
dealings with the Board on this issue, you may prefer to do this.

8. In order to avoid problems like this in the future, HRG
is immediately dedicating several personnel to the task of
reviewing boxes ef documents and determining what our releases a

that. there is only a rudimentary CIA computer index listing “axG@ar pak)

releases and that it is impossible to do—eeeuret’y’ computer °
searches about our releases on specific subjects. Although HRG
personnel are extremely knowledgeable on what has been released,
with over 220,000. CIA documents currently in the collection, it °

is suprising that mistakes like this have not happened more

The following is a draft memo for Jeff. [Is looking at it now so there may be more changes. Please let me know if there is
anything incorrect here. ! have a feeling Jeff will want a meeting with me rather than just the memo. Also, knowing him, he may want
to deal with Tunheim on this directly since he was involved in this. 1 will let you know.

1. Action: That you advise as per paragraph 7.

2. Background: You will recall that you spoke with
Chairman Tunheim of the JFK Board about the attached cable and
the importance of protecting the phrase swith Mexicans" because
it gives away Viaison involvement in a tel-tap operation. At
its 16 April meeting, at which I was present, the Board
reconsidered its initial decision, but determined that the phrase
could be released.

3. It had just come to HRG's attention that this same
cable was released in full by the Board, with no objection by
CIA, in September 1995. CIA probably did not contest this
release because an excerpt from this cable, containing the phrase

"at issue, had been inadvertently released even-priox-toe-that. It
is,. therefore, no longer possible for CIA to argue before the
Board for the protection of this phrase in|the current cable or

to appeal this release to the White House. to the Nehonol Arches ix Aug 73

4. CIA is now in somewhat of an embarrassing position
because it has strenuously argued that the release of this phrase
would cause "clear and convincing damage" to the national
security only to find that this phrase has been released with CIA
acquiescence for at least seven months ,wi i .
Conceivably, the Board could see this incident as a justification
of their second-guessing our damage assessments, and could give
us a much more difficult time in the future.

RE: Foreign Government Liaison
Dear John:

This morning, Jack Tunheim, Phil Golrick, and I: met with Kenneth Duncan and several
State Department representatives regarding how best to implement the JFK Act'as to
information obtained. from foreign governments through liaison channels. We hada
very constructive discussion of the affirmative role the Staie Departmient could play in
encouraging foreign governments, through appropriate-‘diplomatic channels, to agree to
the release of such information pursuant to the JFK Act. The Review Board, believes
that Section 10(b)(2) of the JFK-Act contemplates that the State:Départment play .
precisely such.atole. 9 0 a are

As for now, wé will hold in'abeyancé requésts for evidence on foreign liaison
postponements to which: the FBL has not yet responded: ‘This‘will give us the «.’
Opportunity in the near future to work with the State Department and the FBI to.
establish orderly procedures. to persuade the foreign governments in question, that it is’
in our countries’ mutual interests to release lidison informiation in assassination tecords.
Until such procedures are'in-place; ‘we request that the FBEniot- make further contact. |
with foreign law-enforcement or other government officials regarding the release of
liaison information in assassination records. “- :
