destroyed Che Guevara's guerrilla band in Bolivia. As the result
of extensive Bolivian and international photegraphic press coverage

_ of this event, the life of Mr. VILLOLDO and his family has been and

continues to be in considerable jeopardy. As an example of the
constant fear in which he must live, he learned in August 1969
that he was the target of an assassination attempt directed by
the Cuban Government te be carried out by the Cuban U.N. Mission.

' Fortunately the Cuban recruited te perform the assassination was

a former JMNAVE agent who alerted VILLOLDO and cooperated with
the FBI. ;

4. Since his return from Bolivia Mr. VILLOLDO has trained the
‘Ecuadorean Intelligence. Service for the Agency and has been a pene~

tration into the militant activities of the Cuban exile organiza-
tions in the Miami area, in which capacity he has provided much
valuable information. The time has come, however, that his ser-
vices in this capacity are no longer required and there is ne
piace in the Agency for his other special. talents. Sy mutual

agreement and understanding, therefore, he has made a concerted

effort for some time to pursue all available leads with his exile
friends in an effort to re-establish himself in a sound business.
In this connection he has been given the opportunity to invest in
Téal estate and the construction of condominiua units in the
Miami. area with a prominent Miami Cuban builder who is a reliable
friend. Mr, VILLOLDO needs $30,900 as his share of the initial
capital investment. Current plans are to carry him on the pay-
roll for a maximum of six months at which time he should receive
an income from this venture.

.$. In view of the most unusual circumstances of this case,
and in accordance with the referent mesorandim, it-is requested

that the sum of $30,000 be made available to Hr. VILLOLDO from the

Special Annuity Fund to aid hia in establishing himself on a
sound business basis in the Miami area. For cover purposes a
check will be issued to Mr. VILLOLDO from an ostensible interest-

.b@aring account in an MHMOTUAL holding company in Nassau. The

source can be money from the successful family business which Mr.
VILLOLDO was able to get out of Cuba prior to confiscation of the
business by the Castro Government.

6. A quit claim will be obtained from Mr. VILLOLDO acknowl-
edging receipt of the $30,000 and including a statement that he
will be off the Agency payroll at the end of the six month period.
