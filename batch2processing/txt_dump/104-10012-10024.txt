Dear "Deas NS ,
2. We also note that EPSTEIN in "Legend" claims that accerding to a CIA

telecheck KOSTIKOV was Lee Harvey OSWALD's KGB case officer in Mexico City.
According to BARRON (page 335) OSWALD was in Mexico between September and

November 1963 and was seeking to obtain a Soviet visa.

There was certainly

a KGB interest in OSWALD, although according to NOSENKO this was defensive.
