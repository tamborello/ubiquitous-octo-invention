Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection
Act of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The JFK Task Force requests each Field Office to
conduct a new indices search for any additional information
related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination that may
have been placed on record since the previous search, and to
search their offices, storage areas, or archived files for any
documents or information related to President John PF. Kennedy's
assassination. Dallas, Chicago, New Orleans and Miami are
requested to include RAs in their search for records.

Details: In 1992, Congress signed the Act mandating federal
agencies to release all documents concerning the presidential
assassination or information related by conspiracy theory to the
assassination. The Act narrowly defined the types of information
that agencies could still protect by postponement until the year
2017. The Act also established the Assassination Records Review
Board (the Board) as a separate entity to oversee the release of
material from the federal agencies to the National Archives and
Records Administration (NARA). Beyond the Board's oversight
responsibilities, the Act charged the Board with the duties of
reviewing agencies' proposed postponements with their evidence
for. approval or denial and researching additional areas of
information for new material related to the assassination. The
FBI has been working with the Board since its inception to meet
the requirements. of the Act.

On November 29, 1996, the Board wrote a letter to the
FBI setting forth a formal compliance program. The letter
requested the FBI's cooperation with the Board “in discharging
its responsibility of assuring Congress and the American people
that the goals of the JFK Act will be accomplished to the
greatest reasonable extent.” The compliance program is the
Board's answer to demonstrating “to the American public that a
thorough, good-faith, and diligent effort have been made to
locate and release all remaining assassination-re lated records:
