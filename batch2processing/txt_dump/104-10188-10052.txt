‘SUBJECT ““.. : Renewal of the LIENVOY Project

» «230. Renéwal is requested of the LIENVOY Project |
for the period 1 February 1967 through 31 January
1968 for a total of $57,100, with $22,470 for FY

- 1967 and $34,630 for FY 1968. The LIENVOY Project
was included in the 1967 Operational Program for_

* $50,000, The additional funds required for FY
1967 are available within WH Division.

2, The LIENVOY Project covers both access to

3, The phone taps produce FI, CE, and operitional
support information. According to Headquarters
records, during the period 1 February through 31
December 1966, LIENVOY was the source of ninety-eight
positive intelligence reports, seventy-nine of which
were disseminated. These reports covered the follow-
ing general Subject categories: Soviet Embassy
activities in Mexico, Mexican Communist Party activi-
ties, Communist front activities, the activities of
the Chicom representatives in Mexico, and the
activities of various extremist groups. Included in
this reporting was that prior to and during President
Johnson's trip to Mexico City in April 1966. The
Station's reporting on this trip, which included
LIENVOY, was highly praised by the customers, UIENVOY
also provided some good coverage during tho trouble
at the National Autonomous University (UNAM) in the
spring and useful information during disturbances at
some of the other universities. The remainder of the
LIENVOY coverage couid be considered of medium-level
interest and value. During the same period, LIENVOY

Comments and Recornmendations (Tot ve forwarded to the Division)

1. Our files contain 107 positive intelligence reports produced wholly |
or in part by LIENVOY and disseminated in the period 1 F ebruary igdd - 31.

- January 1967. Over half of this production (60 reports) dealt with rians and
activities of Mexican Communists and other leftists. Included were 17
reports which provided useful information on the unrest at the National
Autonomous University (UNAM) and other universities. As our recent
study of reporting on Mexico indicates, student unrest has been a sudject
of high interest to the community. Also included were 13 dissemi
which contributed to the station's coverage, highly praised by all
of leftist activities in connection with President Johnson's visit.
30 reports in this group, primarily concerning the PCM, MLN, ani PPS,
varied considerably in quality but in general appeared to be of moderate
value in relation to customer needs.

  

 
 
  

 

 
  
  
 
 

2. The disseminated production from foreign Communist installations
was relatively meager. There were 9 reports on relations with the Soviets,
mostly on culiural programs; 3 reports on commercial negotiate with
Czechoslovakia and Poland; 7 reports concerned with Cuba; and
on Chicom (NCNA) activities in Mexico. With the po sible excep
information on Mexican-Bloc trade -- a subject of r

_ 2. LIENVOY was. estimated at $57,000. in our recent FY 1968
program .¢xercise, so we must ask that you stay within this figure
inthe renewal,: Iz you will be needing replacements for equipment

the cost of such procurement?.. .

  
 

 

 

      

- 3. ‘Headquarters appreciates the carefully detailed renewals
which you prepare on LIENVOY because they give such a. good picture of
what the project produces. Could you also include in the current
renewal a brief description of the center and the equipment and
fiow the management of the daily routine is shared betwcen AREHART
