Captioned case was opened on the following '
information, which was furnished on 7/11/58, from NY 169-C: -
; "Informant advised that he did not know ANITA
LICARI, who resided at 7401-A 74th Street, Brooklyn, but that
he recalled one JOSEPH LICARI, a combination man about 50
years old and a friend of JOE PROFACI, Informant had not
seen JOE LICARI in a couple of years at this time, but
stated that he came from the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn."

GUISEPPE LICARI, FBI # 337703A, which he identified as
identical with the JOSEPH.LICARI, whom he referred to a

FBI # 337703A, who was identified on 4/23/63; ‘was born

on 10/26/27, and would only be 36 years of age at present.

 

SO A review of the indices of the NYO reflects reference
to a JOSEPH LICARI, New Haven,.Conn. PD # 83650, who is a

close associate of RALPH TROPIANO, It was felt that inasmuch
as TROPIANO originally came from NY this LICARI might be
‘4dentical to the individual referred to by NY 169-C as a
"combination man". - e ytd

By letter dated 5/12/63, the New Haven Division
furnished photographs of JOSEPH LICARI, NHPD # 83650.

. These photographs were exhibited to NY 169-C
and he stated that this was not the LIGARI referred to by

him.

Photographs of JOSEPH LICARI, FBI # 337703A,
and JOSEPH LICARI, NHPD # 83650, were exhibited to
Ny 3461-C-TE on 6/5/63, and to Ny 3864-C-TE on 6/6/63.
Both of these 4nformants failed to 4dentify either of the
JOSEPH LICARIs as anyone known by them.

, In view of the aifference in the age of JOSEPH
LICARI, FBI # 337703A; and the age of the individual originally
referred to by NY 169-c and the fact that this individual

ig unknown to either NY 3461-C-TE or NY 3864-C-TE, it is

felt that NY 169-C is mistaken in his identification.

Inasmuch as NY 169-C, NY: 3461-C-TE, and NY 3864-C-TE
all failed to identify JOSEPH LICARI, NHPD #83650, as a member
of "La Causa Nostra” and the files of the NYO contain no
reference to any other JOSEPH LICARI, who could be identical
with the individual referred to by NY 169-C, this case is

peing closed.
