On the night of 4/3/61, pursuant to a specific
request, MM-722-C telephonically contacted Supervisor :
SWINNEY. He was asked to furnish all information concerning
MEROLA's possible participation in this loss and was advised
that information he had previously given to SA CLINKSCALES
was known to SA SWINNEY. He was told it was absolutely
necessary to determine from whom he had obtained this infor-
mation and the complete details.

MM-722-C advised he had learned from MEL ADLER
that MEROLA had sold two pieces of jewelry immediately following
instant loss to a local individual in order to get money for
MEROLA's “two boys" to get aut of town until things cooled off.
He also advised that CHARLES DELMONICO, son of Top Hoodlum
CHARLIE "THE BLADE" TOURINE, had told him, MM-722-C, he had
recently purchased two pieces of jewelry from MEROLA for
$7,500 in order for MEROLA to get money to sep his boys out
of town until things cooled off. LAL

anne

MM-722-C also advised MEROLA had in his possession
a gun with a silencer and it is noted a silencer equipped gun
was used in instant robbery.

In view of the foregoing information, it was
considered desirable to interview MEROLA in an attempt to
resolve whether he was implicated in this violation.
Accordingly, SA SWINNEY telephonically contacted him,
requesting that he come to the Miami office on the morning
of 4/5/61. He appeared voluntarily as requested and was
interviewed by SA SWINNEY out of the presence of any other
personnel since it was felt he would be more likely to
admit any implication on his part under these conditions.
