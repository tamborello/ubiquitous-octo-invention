Subject: PC Support for Assassination Record Review Board
(ARRB) Reviewers

; Attached id] ___{note on INFOSEC procedures.

It appears that the ARRB reviewers will be able to take lap-
tops in and out of the building as long as security
requirement for handling classified diskettes and Classified
PCs are met. HRG will have to maintain the proper logs and
forms. .

I propose we implement Situation #3 (board reviewers
can carry their own SECRET Laptops daily in & out of the
building). Establishing procedures for a LOG and the Form
4261 should not be a problem. We will need 2 or 3 HRG
staffers with media badges to fill out the form 4261 or to
escort the Board’ reviewers out of the building.
