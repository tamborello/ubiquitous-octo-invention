culties encountered by the underground, during the last
few months of his activity, were those imposed by the

vigilance committees in each block which made it impossible
to meet, and therefore impossible to plam. He said that
every movement is viewed with suspicion and that it was
only because of his position as a physician that he was
able to operate as a coordinator in the Professional
Section. He stated, however, that he was surveilled from
time to time, and was frequently asked to explain how he
had spent certain periods ‘of time.

a mentioned that another serious
problem f ‘he underground was that of finances. As an
example, he pointed out that certain people who devoted

their entire activity to underground work had to be
supported by the underground. He recalled that during the
year and a half he was in the 30th of November Movement, the
group lost in one fashion or another, 82 automobiles. He
said that automobiles were vital to the €£fective qperation
of the underground in the cities.
