Cuban interpreters are now
posted at several surface-to-air mis-
sile (SAM) sites on the island.

b. We think this means that
on-site training of Cubans has begun
on schedule, Field training is to
last six months, after which the
SAM system may be turned over to
Castro.

ce. In the past month some
1,500 Soviets arrived in Cuba, Most
of these were probably SAM experts,
sent to monitor the training.

c. The Betancourt government
has struck back hard. Its new uni-
fied command over the security forces,

 

passed this
initia est W ying colors.

 

d. At least 500 extremists
were arrested and the round-up is
still going on, Their removal will
hamper the Communist drive against
elections in major cities like Caracas.

e. We now expect the elections
to be held on schedule, a consider-
able achievement under the circum-
stances. The elections will be fol-
lowed, however, by a Communist ef-
fort to prevent the March inaugura-
tion of the victor.

£, The rub here is that none
of the presidential candidates com-
mands President Betancourt's con-
siderable assets for dealing success-
fully with the harsh realities of
Venezuelan politics. The constitu-
tion prevents Betancourt from suc-
ceeding himself.

g. In the background, as
always, looms the military, which
could intervene if the president-
elect shows signs of being soft on
communism,

their new responsibilities. There
are, however, a few signs of dissen~
sion within this group and between
it and civilian politicians,

 

 

 

 

h, The new regime has also
embarked on a purge of high military
officers who sided with Diem during
the Buddhist crisis.and failed to

set on the right side soon enough.

a. The death toll from the
terrorist outburst in Caracas last
Tuesday and Wednesday now stands at
about 30,

 

b. This is the high water mark
thus far in the campaign of the
Castro-supported Communist extremists
to disrupt the national elections a
week from tomorrow.

1. South Vietnam a. Vietnamese Communist ef-
forts to discredit the new Saigon
regime stayed in high gear this
week,

b. The number of armed attacks
was off from the high of the previous
week but still some 50% above the -
year's weekly average. ;

ce. These attacks have been,
for the most part, small-scale efforts
directed against the government's
paramilitary forces in the villages.
.They have been designed more for
their psychological impact than for
immediate military gain.

 

 

 

e. The new government is re-
sponding by stepping up its own
military operations, It is also
setting about the hard job of re-
vamping the Diem government .apparatus
and harnessing broader popular sup-
port for the war effort.

£. The generals have been
dealing fairly effectively with
