SUBJECT:

Re Bureau letter dated 2/17/65, requesting
Philadelphia to forward specific examples
of information furnished by PH 705-C* to
provide basis for justification of con-
tinuance of this source for a 60 day period.

It should be noted that PH 705-C* furnishes
information in regard to PH 672-C-TE, a known member of: 7
La Cosa Nostra. PH 705-C* during the pertinent. period
has failed to furnish any specific information of value.
It-is not felt, however, that this source should be
discontinued.

The source during the pertinent period was
visited by La Cosa Nostra member FRANK MONTE on two .
occasions. MONTE was out of range of PH 705-C* when con-
versing with the occupant of this location; however, the
source servéd as a means to verify that PH 672-C-TE did not
shield the fact that MONTE visited him and propositioned .
source to accompany him on a proposed holdup. This holdup
was not undertaken. The proposition was made by MONTE.

   

 

PH 672-C-TE improves his financial status
monthly, and it is felt that he will, therefore, be con-
tacted socially more frequently, and since he is a member
of La Cosa Nostra and has potential to furnish valuable
information, Philadelphia will continue PH 705-C*, UACB,

for an additional 60 ) days. .
