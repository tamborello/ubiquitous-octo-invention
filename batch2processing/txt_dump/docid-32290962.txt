2/24/82, a preliminary inguiry was initiate

Ilona Marita Lorenz ,{Wwi with an expiration date of 6/23/82.

 

On ie Ilona Marita Lorenz, 1085 Terrace beive,
Lake, Florida, was interviewed by SA James Patrick Uaflin.
z furnished a rambling, bizarre account of her life with
dictators, organized crime figures, and FBI contacts.
zZ alleged to have born illegitimate children to:

 

Fidel Castro, Prime Minister of Cuba
General Perez Jimenez, Former Dictator of Venezuela
Ed Levy, New York Organized Crime Figure

Lorenz also alleged to have been an FBI informant for
various periods of time, dating back to 1960, when she was a member
of the 26th of July Movement. Lorenz noted that most recently,
she had been providing information to SA Larry Wack of the New
York Office. Lorenz had in her possession a considerable amount
of legal documents and personal memorabilia to lend credence to
her statements, e.g. a Viking Press Publishing House contract
providing Lorenz with a $325,000 advance for her expose on Fidel
Castro, and a letter from Ballantine Books requesting the
exclusive rights to the autobiography of Dr. Fidel Castro Ruz.
Lorenz also verified travel to Cuba from 9/27-28/81. .

Referenced Tampa telephone call to SA Larry Wack, NYO,
was made in order to verify Lorenz' bona fides. SA Wack indicated
that Lorenz had cooperated with the FBI in the past, but she was
unstable. SA Wack noted that Lorenz did associate with organized
crime figures, and that her "affair" with Fidel Castro had been
highly publicized in the past. SA Wack stated that Lorenz may
be providing information of some significance, but that Lorenz
had a penchant for exaggeration. SA Wack recommended providing
| Lorenz' complete novelette to New York for analysis and review.

SA Wack indicated that Lorenz' daughter, Monica, currently resides

in New York, and would be available to verify which aspects of

Lorenz' story were accurate and of a serious nature.

to be disbursed at intervals. For signing the contract, Lorenz
was immediately given $84,000.

  

T. dH. Guinzburg, Viking Press, advised Lorenz to move
away from New York in order to avoid any further publicity.
During January, 1979, Lorenz moved to Darien, Connecticut, where,
based on the merits of her book contract, she received a loan of
$100,000 from the Peoples Bank in order to purchase a home at

86 Maywood Road, Darien.

On 4/16/79, Levy visited Lorenz to warn her the mafia
believed she had purchased the Darien home with mafia money stolen
by Levy. Levy proceeded to make numerous long distance telephone
calls on her telephone, including one to Switzerland. Lorenz
believes Levy did this intentionally in order to implicate her
in his mafia swindle.

Levy told Lorenz that he was paying the Carlo Gambino
family in Brooklyn $10,000 per month in order to stay alive.
Levy asked Lorenz for part of the advance money from the sale of
her book. Lorenz wrote out a $10,000 check to Levy to cover
Levy's May, 1979, protection money.

Lorenz noted that Levy had already been convicted of one
count of mail fraud in New York, but had allegedly received a
reduced sentence for cooperating with the Federal investigators.
Levy was to report to Eglin Air Force Base Minimal Security Prison
the following month to serve a six month sentence. Levy is
currently residing in Ft. Lauderdale, and will be off of parole
in March, 1982.

A week after Levy's visit to Darien, Connecticut, Lorenz’
house was intentionally flooded and her daughter wounded by a
sniper near their home. A second shooting took place during
October, 1979. All of these» incidents were reported to the Darien
Police. Lorenz decided to abandon the house and move the family
back to 512 East 88th Street, Apartment 1D, New York. During this
period, Lorenz had maintained the above apartment because of her
frequent trips back to New York City. Lorenz had been cooperating
with the NYCPD by providing research concerning a law suit by
Frank Sturgis against the NYCPD. Sturgis was suing the NYCPD for
$15 million for false arrest. Sturgis had been arrested for
threatening Lorenz prior to her testifying before the Sub-committee
on the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
