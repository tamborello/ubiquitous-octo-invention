Oswald's background he felt that Oswald might have had

| foreign intelligence connections - Soviet or Cuban ~ al-

though none was ever found. He expressed dismay that

1 critics have interpreted this sentence to refer to sus-
pected or confirmed connections between Oswald and any
U.S. intelligence agency. He admitted that this sentence
is ambiguous, but he stated that it was irresponsible with-
out even bothering to ask him to explain it.

Gale stated that he had no knowledge that Oswald
was ever an FBI informant. He conceded, however, that his
assignments connected with the assassination were limited

' and he did not review FBI field office files which could

have contained information on this issue not maintained at

headquarters. He stated that agents sometimes had "vest-

pocket" informants which were never formally recorded. He

also stated that, as alleged, it would have been possible

for an FBI clerk to have checked file indices and found

Oswald listed as an information source.

| Gale did not know of any FBI employees who may
have known about the destroyed Oswald letter, other than

\ what has been publicly established. He had no knowledge

about the Hosty notebook entry.

Interview: a oO |
Harold Leap and Robert Genzman interviewed James 'H.

Gale,” formerly PBI Assistant Director, Inspection Division,

' . at his “law office in Fairfax, Virginia. —

i os Gale was hired as a clerk for the FBI on: November :29, a :

1939. He became an agent on June 21, 1943, and served as oS

Assistant SAC and SAC in Anchorage, and as SAC in Richmond,

 

Cincinnati, Washington field office, and Chicago. -In 1963 he.
became Assistant Director of the Spécial Investigations Divi-
sion. He retired on October l, 1971.

Gale related. that on November 23, 1963, J. Edgar
Hoover and Clyde Tolson asked him to conduct an inspection of
the FBI's handling of the Oswald case prior ‘to the assassina-
tion of President Kennedy. In a memo to Tolson dated Decem-
ber 10, 1963, Gale determined that 17 FBI employees should be :
disciplined for investigative shortcomings. Gale determined Oo
that Oswald should have been on the security Index, although . '
he feels that this would have made no difference in protecting
the President. Gale stated that he felt pressured to make

censures, since the Warren Commission would probably want
to know what actions had been taken to remedy the short—
comings. Hoover agreed with Gale's findings, and Alan Bel-
mont disagreed.

In a memo to Tolson dated September 30, 1964, Gale
recommended additional disciplining of eight of the 17 FBI
employees who had previously been disciplined. Gale stated
that this "second round" was based on the poor performance
of FBI employees as determined by the Warren Commission,
causing embarrassment to the FBI.

Gale was asked to explain the following passage from
' page 5 of his September 30, 1964 memo:

: The Bureau by letter to the Commission

; indicated that the facts did not warrant

i placing a stop on the passport (of Oswald)

‘ as our investigation disclosed no evidence

' that Oswald was acting under the instruc-

tions or on behalf of any foreign government

or instrumentality thereof. Inspector feels

it was proper at that time to take this
"public" position. However, it is felt that

| with Oswald's background we should have had

! a stop on his passport, particularly since

; we did not know definitely whether or not he had
any intelligence assignments at that time.

Gale stated that this public position was taken
to prevent embarrassing the FBI. With regard to the last

sentence of the passage, Gale stated that in light of
