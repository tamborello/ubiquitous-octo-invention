BOSCH receives funds from inside Cuba or any other foreign

country, as the MIRR is financed through fund raising campaigns:

carried on by BOSCH and his organization in the United States,

including Puerto Rico. Most of this money is raised in the.
‘Miami area.

‘It is to be noted that JOHNSON was arrested with
BOSCH and four other individuals. on June 10, 1965, near
Otlanda, Florida by U.S. Customs Agents on charges of at-—
tempting to illegally ship arms and explosives ‘out of the
United States. |

On August 2, 1965, MM T-1, a Cuban exile who has
been closély associated with the MIRR in revolutionary
matters over a period of several years, advised that BOSCH.
is the head of the MIRR, which exists only in the United a
States, including Puerto Rico. ne

He described. ‘the MIRR as being a very small ore,
ganization with only 5 or 6 really ative members. MM T-1.
said that BOSCH is not, responsible to anyone or any organ=
ization located in Cuba or in any other foreign count vs
BOSCH, and several of his close associates in Miami, includ-
ing MARCELINO GARCIA JIMENEZ, LAREDO. RODRIGUEZ RIVERA,

' make all the decisions concerning plans and operations.

MM T-1 pointed out that from time to time BOSCH
makes extravagant announcements indicating that he has a-
following inside Cuba, and receives the support of many
- people in the United States, however, this is strictly
propaganda released for the purpose of enhancing BOSCH’ 8
image as a revolutionary leader.

A review of the entire file in this case, dating
back over a period of several years, fails to reflect that
either BOSCH or the MIRR has a foreign principal inside
Cuba or any other foreign country. It is felt that no
further investigation for the purpose of attempting to
eStablish 1£ the MIRR has a foreign principal is justi-
fied at the present time.
