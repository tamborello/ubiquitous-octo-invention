SUBJECT: JFK Assassination - Release of Information from FBI
Investigation of Foreign Officials J97

}8f This is in response to your memorandum of March 21 on the above subject.
We oppose release of the referenced material.

(S) Release of the material would damage U.S. foreign relations by revealing FBI
collection of information involving; Israeli diplomatic personnel, other Israeli
officials, and U.S. citizens coriducting routine contacts with Israelis. ;We would
expect the Government of Israel ito react quickly and negatively to the release of
such material. ‘

(S) We also note that the referenced material clearly indicates there is no
connection between the information discussed by the’ Israeli diplomat and the
subject of the investigation. We therefore do not believe that the tnaterial would
be of any value to investigators if it were released. Its release would serve no
useful purpose.
