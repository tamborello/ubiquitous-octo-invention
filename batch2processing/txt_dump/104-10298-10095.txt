On April 15, 1963, MM T-1 advised that he was
poattive that MIRO CARDONA did not intend to again tender
his resignation on Monday, April 15, 1962, but was
contemplating taking that action on the following Thursday,
April 18, 1963. MM T-l said that the Council was meeting ~...
on Thursday to take a definite attitude ortough line of ee
action and that it waa entirely probable that all of the
members of the Council might resigh in protest to the present
policy of the United States with regard to the Cuban situation.
He said that the prezent feeling of the Council towards the
United States 1s tasically “to hell with it".

MM T-1 expressed the personal feeling that VU. S.
policy towards Cuba 1s presentlyin a vacuum and consequently
everything is at a standstill. ‘Ine Cuban exiles in the
Miami area feel that the U. S. is abandoning their cause
and has now adopted a course of peaceful cc-existence with

communist Cuba.

On April 16, 1963, MM T-2, a Cuban exile who has .
furnished some reliable information in the past and who is ve
associated with fellow Cubans who belong to several different
organizations, addvieed that reaction among the Cuban exiles
ia “very bad against the United States". He explained that the
Cuban exiles allege that President KENNEDY nas made promises
to help them in their fight against CASTRO but is now opposing
them and consequently they feel that the U. 8. 1s now committed
to a policy of peaceful co-existence with Communist Cuba. .

’ The Cuban exiles are fearful as to the future, confused as to
why the U. S. has changed ite policy and the exiles feel that
they have been abandoned in their fight.

carried an article entitled, "Exiles Say Miro.To Quit",
This article stated that informed exile sources claim
that Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA would rezizn his post as head
of the Cuban Revolutionary Council. Tne article Said
exile sources gave two possibilities for his resignation.
One faction believed that MIRO's recent trip to Washington
from which he retumed Sunday (April 7) was to pin down the
United States Government to a statement of positive policy
regarding Cuba. Another school of thought was that the
Council head was vetiring from his poet in protest of:
Government curbing of hit-and-run raids on the Comaunist
island of Cuba.

The article went on to state that Dr. MIRO's
leadership in the Council, aimed at uniting all Cuban
exiles, nas been burdened by problems since his appointment

in March 1961,

MK T-1 explained that when Dr, MIRO CARDONA returned
to Miami from a trip to Washington, D. C., on Sunday, where he
contacted high government officials, he came away with the

feeling that:

1) The United States has no plan to free Cuba
of Communism.

2) If the United States ever does formulate any
plans, 1 will do so without consideration
for the Cuban exiles in the United States.

3) The United States policy is now one of
peaceful co-existence with Communist Cuba.

MM T-1 said that in his opinion, the Cuban exiles
are frustrated, confused, losing faith in the United States
and there is a growing feeling of abandonment of them by the

United States.

The April 16, 1963, issue of the "Miami Herald"
carried a headline article entitled, “Miro Resigns as Exile
Chief; Raps U. S. Policy". This article stated that MIRO
CARDONA resigned because the United States refused to allocate
fifty million dollars to train a Cuban invasion force, according
