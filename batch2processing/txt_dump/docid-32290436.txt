TP 92-1

This PCI, who has been closely associated with BLACK-

BURN in Brevard County, stated that about a year and a

half ago, BLACKBURN “broke off with the 'Tallys,'"” :
meaning the Italians in Tampa. PCI] explained

that he, informant, first became acquainted with BLACK-
BURN's Cuba operation during about 1/62, when BLACKBURN
was being banked by an Italian in Tampa .

Further, the above PCT stated that he could not
recall this Italian's name, and does not believe he-ever
met him. He.does know that this man did have the "Tropi-
cana" in Havana before CASTRO threatened to kill him. He
returned to the U. 8. after hiding in Cuba for two months.
This man kept a lot of money in a trunk in his home, and
charged BLACKBURN a high rate of interest when BLACKBURN
found it. necessary to borrow. PCI seemed to recall. that
this man also had a home in Miami, and knows that he had:
a brother active in the business. It is his recollection -
that these brothers also had two or three clubs in Tampa
that were closed down. He said this individual may. have
been named "SANTO." oe

The Tampa Office will, of course, continue to
follow this development closely and discreetly through
PCI lat Cocoa, and other reliable sources in the
Orlando area. In the meantime, however, it is requested
that the Miami Office maintain close liaison with Lt..
LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK, Intelligence Unit, .Dade County. SO,
Miami, for any. further specific information the latter! s
informant may receive in this matter.

It should be noted that the above communication
sets forth information obtained 9/28/64 from Lt. LESLIE
VAN BUSKIRK, Intelligence Unit, Dade County SO, Miami,
to the effect.that. he, BUSKIRK, recently received infor-
mation from a confidential. informant he considers reliable,
that subject TRAFFICANTE had failed in his attempts to.
take over bolita. operations in Miami, and was "giving it
up as a bad job." BUSKIRK's informant. said he had heard
that TRAFFICANTE: planned to move his headquarters to
Orlando, Florida, where he could operate without as much |
interference from law enforcement officers. :
