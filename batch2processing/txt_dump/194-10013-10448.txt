4, ZF Source has heard of the existence of a group of officers in the Cubari
Officer Yraining Program who are considering resigning from the Program in the near
future, At LAFB, there are a number who are waiting for the termination of their
English course to resign, while others plan to turn in their resignation after
arriving at a new station. One of them is Rene F, Gomez-Figueroa, 2d Lt, C2 312.
397, Source believes that the reason for their leaving is that they plan to trans~
fer to Nicaragua, or another overseas base, in order to continue their fight against
Communist Cuba, This group is in contact with Pedro Acebo-Rodriguez “End Antonio »

. lglesias-Pons,, both of whom resigned from the Cuban Training Program upon completion

of the course at Fort Benning and who are in Nicaragua organizing anti-Castro regime
activities, (This group’ consists mainly of men who fought in the Bay of Pigs in-
vasion of Cuba}

resigning the program and requesting that the letter be circulated among the fel-

low officers of the class at LAFB, The letter said that he (Muina) left the _
course because many of the men who had applied for the various schools, such as

the Intelligence and the Armored Schools, were still at Fort Beming wasting time. ’
Also, Muina had applied for a demolition course and after he was placed on orders
to go to the course, the orders were cancelled, Muina did not like this and de-
‘cided to get out, Source, who knows Muina well, is certain that Muina is working
for or with Artime also, Muina has indicated repeatedly to his friends and to
the officers undergoing the program that Cuba will not gain its liberty with the
assistance of the United States, but needs to look for help from another country.
Muina believes that the United States has decided to apply the principle of co-
existence towards Cuba, Muina also has stated that the United States Government
lacks the ability to understand the Latin American problems, and that he is going
to join Artime,

7. C2 312 431, is attempting to
find our“if the ultimate purpose OF the Cuban Officer Traiming-Program is identical
to the program which is controlled by Nanuel Artime to train people in Nicaragua,
Upon obtaining this information, Borges-Torres is going to inform Source, If the
plan is the same, everyone in the progran will immediately go to Nicaragua because
in Nicaragua the fight against Castro is more imminent. Help has been offered to
Artime by Sonoza of Nicaragua and by de Gaulle of France, whe apparently has
offered the Isle of Martinique for the operations against Castro. Manuel Artime
visited Columbus, Georgia, a few months ago and spoke to many Cuban officers and
tried to recruit them as instructors to go to the camp in Nicaragua. Source was
not present at any of the meetings with Artime.
