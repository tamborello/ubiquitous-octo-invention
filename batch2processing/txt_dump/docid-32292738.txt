Information Concerning ANTHONY DETOLVE

During the afternoon of 2/4/63, former State \
Senatore FRED ROTI came in and conversed with MARCY concerning
the fact that ANTHONY DETOLVE is shooting off sparks and is
angered due to the fact that it was his understanding that

‘he was not only to be made Alderman but Ward Committeeman

of the First Ward as well. ROTI and MARCY's conversation
continued as follows:

ny

ROTI: He says he has $50,000 that JOHN was supposed to
make him a judge and he (obs) him. He says JOHN
(obs) up on five things. He says I can't get along
‘with him. He says I hate his (obs) guts and he hates
my guts. He says it's never gonna work out.

' MARCY: Don't worry about it, you don't worry about nothin’,

ROTI: He says if he's gonna have his office here, I don’t
want my office here, ,

MARCY: I let him know. I told him, listen, there are
certain things I ain't never gonna tell you! You're
not supposed to know certain things. Now drop it

there! You were told that, I told you that. He says

I don't have to listen to you. I said that's

right you don't, I'm not your boss. But if you don't
listen to me you! re making a big mistake! Then he
changed his tune.

ROTI: I think [________] who is real close to him,
: . May be giving him ideas. You know he’s a nice
fellow all right, but he's pretty cute. He says
I didn't want this, he wanted a judgeship.

CJ is identical with ‘a PCI of the
Chicago Office.
