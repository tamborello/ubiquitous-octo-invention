REFERENCE s Request Memo, 16 September 1964

   

i. Reference forwarded (i) a poor quality reduced eise phote-

graph of a Cuban Visa Application in the name of Lee H. Oewald with |
& handwrittea notation in the lower left corner that appears to read
“Hotel del Cameron(?)/Room 18 46-60-51(7)", (2) enlarged photograph,

' unknown eixe, of signature "'S. de Duran", and (3) Xerox copy of Volume
3 of the exhibite in the "Investigation of Asgaseination cf President John F.
Kennedy, November 22, 1963", containing handwriting specimens of Lee
Harvey Oswald, It was requested that an effort be made to determine if
Silvia Duran or Lee H. Oswald wrote the notation in the lower left corner
of the vies application,

2. There are several obstacles, or deficiencies in evidence,
which preclude reaching an un-qualified opinion in this matter, such ae
the extreme poor quality of the reduced size (estimated to be about .3X to
&5X) photograph of the visa application as opposed to the enlarged Duran
Ofgnature, and the absence of comparable lettere in the two writings.

3. Nevertheless, careful examination and comparieon of all of
the writing leads to the following opinion: There is enougn aimYarity i
between the writing in the @ignature "S. de Duran" and the questicnad ~ |
notation on the visa epplication to make {¢ appear probable that Duran !
placed the notation on the application. Or, stating it another way: I~
would not eliminate her as a suspect writer of the notation. Examination
ef the original documente might remove these qualifications. ; :

4. Ido not find enough similarity between Oswald's writing and
the questioned notation to warrant a euepicion that he ls the author.
