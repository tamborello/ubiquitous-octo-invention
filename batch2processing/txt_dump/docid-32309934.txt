Reference is made to various Bureau airtels in
connection with captioned cases, the dates of which will be
incorporated,under the section to which they pertain.

“fhe purpose of this airtel is to call to the attention
of all offices receiving copies the various phases of investigations
being conducted primarily with respect to the relationship of
JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA and the DORFMANs in the insurance field.
This is being done to insure that all offices are aware of the i
nature cf the various investigations requested in order to . i
alert these offices to report any information which may be
developed pertinent to any of the phases hereinafter discussed.
The further purpose is to call to the Bureau's attention certain
items ascertained from a review of the voluminous data furnished
by the Department, to make certain suggestions and to request
Bureau advice with respect to certain items.

Buairtel 10/18/62 set out the original request for
investigation in this matter, whose primary objective, as the.
Bureau has noted, is to determine if any commissions resulting
‘from captioned operations are being received by the DORFMANs,
HOFFA or others close to HOFFA and. the Teamsters.

- From the information made available by Departmental -
Memo 10/15/62, it is obvious that certain investigation has
been conducted at Republic National Life (RNL) of Dallas, Texas,
probably by CARL SCHULTZ, Bureau of Labor Management Reports, |
Chicago, Illincis. Attention is also directed to other
investigation obviously conducted at RNL in connection with the
Teamster Income Protection (TIP) Insurance Program hereinafter
discussed. The results of this investigation at RNL have not

- been made available by the Department except by piecemeal

“\ reference in enclosed data. The Department also requested

interview with FRANK WRIGHT of United Bonding Company,
* Indianapolis, Indiana, which was performed on 10/23/62 and

reported in report of SA KENNETH P. PETTIJOHN dated 10/25/62
at Indianapolis, under this section's caption. Chicago is of
the opinion that results of interview of WRIGHT which had —

f previously been conducted by WALTER SHERIDAN of the Department . {
and Mr, SCHWARTZ (probably CARL SCHULTZ) should have been :
made available to the Bureau by the Department prior to interview. ‘

It is also observed that among other things an
» interview with CHARLES BRAY was r@quested in the Teamster
’ Bonding Program, hereinafter disctlssed. For the Bureau's
confidential information, during the course of the Federal
. Grand Jury investigation into the Teamsters Union Pension
Fund Loans in Chicago during August-Odtober, 1962, one of
the Departmental Attorneys was overheard to remark that
WALTER SHERIDAN of the Department has been in contact with
-. CHARLES BRAY. and apparently has received information from
BRAY and is attempting to develop BRAY as an informant. Chicago
is of the opinion that if such is the case, the results of
SHERIDAN's contacts with BRAY should be made available to
Chicago prior to any attempt at further interview of BRAY.

It is also obvious that other investigation and/or
interviews have been conducted by others prior to the Bureau's
entrance into these cases. References to these prior
investigations are scattered throughout the various Departmental
Memoranda submitted; Chicago is of the opinion that results of
any investigation by whomsoever conducted should be made
available in its original form, or by coples thereof, to the
Bureau offices for information, evaluation and guidance.

With respect to captioned subject matter, Chicago,
.for the present, contemplates limiting its investigation to
the. Teamsters Union Pension Fund Loans which were the subject
of Federal Grand Jury inquiry in Chicago. Reviews of files
and certain subpoenaed material are being made and appropriate
leads will be set out shortly.
