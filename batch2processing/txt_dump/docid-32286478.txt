It is noted that both STALLARD and BENNER opined
that the telephone at Nubes No. 2 would still be the telephone
originally issued in the name of ALBERT ANDREAS years~ago,

tion of a telephone requires a purchase of a substantial.
block of stock in the telephone company , and a person buying
property normally buys the stock in the telephone already

installed QR) ‘Y)

c However Jen 6-26-68 JAigrto GUERRA of the Cuernavaca.
Police ho Was contacted on a confidential basis, advised
that ephone number 2-28-65 is now issued to DANIEL DIAZ,
address Lazaro Cardenas 21-A, Cuernavaca. DIAZ has had this

He believed the telephone at Nubes No. 2 is now
2-01-02, and was attempting to check long-distance calls
for this number .« Qe. Jey

 

He personally WA satiea photographs of Subject as
a person he often observed in Cuernavaca at the Hosteria Las
Quintas and at the Cafeteria Universal in the central plaza
of Cuernavaca, However, he advised he had not seen this
individual in. several months. Ww: rtain he would have
seen him if he were in Cusenavace. $

He recalled seping this individual in a white
Oldsmobile convertible Z(4) .

It is mer’ that he may be over-imaginative
in this point, since the description of the Oldsmobile in
Mexico received some publicity, whereas circumstances
indicate that Subject actually most recently had been using |
a. Mercedes in Mexico, j

However, it is suggested that it might be of
interest for Chicago to check out the whereabouts of the
previously-described white Oldsmobile u)

All persons contacted requested that their identities RO
be concealed. K .
