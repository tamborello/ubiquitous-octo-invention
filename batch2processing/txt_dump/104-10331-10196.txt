MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM: } .
Lér, Inrormation Management Branch

Office of Personnel Security

 

 

SUBJECT: OSWALD, LEE HARVEY
AIN: 0351164

1. The Office of Personnel Security was tasked on 31
January 1997 by the Historical Review Group/Center for the Study
of Intelligence (HRG/CSI), via the Directorate of Es
Administration/Information Review Office, with researching pre=
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The tasking was
generated by the John F. Kennedy Board’s desire to review and
declassify relevant material. The results of this review were
forwarded to the HRG/CSI on 27 February 1997.

 

2. During the Information Management Branch’s
(IMB)research in response to the above tasking it was noted that
Volume V of the Oswald files was not on the shelf where Volumes
I-IV and VI-VII were located. A search of the entire area where
the volumes had been maintained failed to locate Volume V. The
IMB Files Section was subsequently charged with conducting an

all out search for the missing volume. The search failed to find
Volume V.

3. In July 1997, the Oswald files were reviewed page by
page prior to being turned over to HRG/CSI and another attempt
was made to locate Volume V or to locate persons who might know
what happened to it. Volume V was not located nor were any
persons located who were knowledgeable of its status.

4. During the complete review of the Oswald files no
time gap was apparent and no one was located who could recall
ever seeing Volume V. This would suggest that either Volume V
had been consolidated into other volumes or that Volume V never
existed, but that a numbering error resulted in what should have
been Volume V being labeled as Volume VI. The use of Roman
numerals on the cover of the volumes might have caused this
error to occur.
