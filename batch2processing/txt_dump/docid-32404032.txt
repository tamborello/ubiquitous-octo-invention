Mr. David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Assassination Records
Review Board

600 E Street, NW

Washington, DC 20530

Dear David:

In response to your letter of May 1, 1996, this is to
request that two documents acted on by the Board at its
16-17 April meeting be reconsidered so that the postponements
within them conform to previous Board determinations.

The two documents, Nos. 104-10019-10022 and 104-10019-
10023, dealing with Oswaldâ€™s activities in Mexico City, are
duplicates of documents previously reviewed by the Board.

Due to a technical error committed by our reviewers as they
were preparing the documents for release, certain information
was not marked for postponement. The information in question
concerns details of a sensitive activity that has been
consistently protected in other documents.

Sincerely,
Li fone .

John F. Pereira
