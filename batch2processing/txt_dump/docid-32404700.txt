I do not know.

I know, as I told you, that there was a SAVCHENKO... in the KGB,
the MVD, that there was a SAVCHENKO, the name SAVCHENKO, General
SAVCHENKO was chief of Intelligence and then SAVCHENKO, before this
SAVCHENKO, supposedly, was, well, a Minister in the Ukraine, that
this SAVCHENKO ((is)) Chairman of the KGB in Moldavia.

That is all I know about SAVCHENKO.

Which SAVCHENKO? !

You made this conclusion yourself, or you knew ((this)) when you

were working?

((Interrupts)) Well, when I was working, I knew; here I heard a

little bit, here a little bit of something.

From where (1G).

Because each person, Soviet, who works in intelligence, in counter-=
intelligence, especially in recent times, he knows the difference
exactly and he knows both SAVCHENKOs from top to bottom (kak

obluplennyye)..

I think not (Ya ne dumayu), because....

Both of them are lieutenant generals, both are lieutenant generals,
both are connected with intelligence and counterintelligence.

So, the question is (stoit): either you were there and must know
exactly, or you were not there and do not know.

I said what I know.

We will say this: that I am saying what [I know....

Of course....

I certainly am not trying to contradict the facts, to tell you

something superfluous or to wring out something unusual; I am saying

Set

only that which in fact....

In fact, facts.
And I am telling you that I did not know this....

«(XG = A and B speak at the same time))
...To explain these facts articulately.

You may (mozhete) know millions of other things which I do not know.
But I know millions of things which you do not know.

Well, what do you want from me?

Tell ((me)), please, that a person -- if he had worked 11 years,
knows GOGLIDZE, MASLENNIKOV....

((Interrupts)) I heard,

I do not know, I do not know, but I have heard the name.

. Must know SAVCHENKO, Ivan Tikhonovich, also.
Working in the Second Chief Directorate, even if you did not write
any kind, of reports (C‘letters" - pis'ma)) to him, probably some
kind of papers (bumagi) came from him every week.

I do not want to tell you....

((Interrupts)) ((I did not see any)) papers over SAVCHENKO's

signature (za podpis'yu SAVCHENKO) .

If you did not see ((such papers)), then again there is (stoit) a

big question: were you there at this time?

The whole question lies in this.

I am not trying to go into something deeply (zalazit' Kuda-to gluboko);
I simply am taking those persons and figues who are so outstanding

(kotoryye prosto s nog sshibatel'nyy) ((that)) one cannot be mis~-

SECRET

taken; a person who....

I do not know this.

I heard the last name (familiya), and ((that is)) all.

If you have heard this last name (familiya), then you must have

heard the last name (familiya) of that one a hundred times more.

Maybe I did hear ((it)), but I do not know.
I am telling you that I do not know and that neither one of (ni odin

iz) the SAVCHENKOs ever was my chief, ever.
He stood closer, closer to the Second Chief Directorate than this one.

Not one of my, of these SAVCHENKOs was my chief.
My chief was FEDOTOV, SHUBNYAKOV, GRIBANOV; I am saying ((that))

these ((were)) the big chiefs.
I do not think that you are trying to understand me well.

I am trying to understand you well.

How is this -= I am not trying to understand you well?

It is in my interests (Eto v moikh interesakh) .

I am trying to explain to you that if you, as an employee who worked
((there)) for 11 years, know the SAVCHENKO who was in the Ukraine,
who was chief of Intelligence, who then found himself with neither -
business nor position, what happened to him, then you name him,
((say)) that he ((is a)) Minister in Moldavia.

I am telling you <- and this ((is)) established by the facts, even

Soviet newspapers, including the names, etc. etc....

Of course.

Deputies are elected, there ((are)) Soviets (tam sovety)....

... Another person, but not this person.

My question: What do you know happened to the SAVCHENKO who was

SRURET

chief of Intelligence?

one time, an employee of the CPSU Central Committee (Ts K KPSS).
Therefore, I am asking you whether you have heard something interesting
with regard....

B. ((Interrupts)) SAVCHENKO -- that is the last name (familiya), and

that is what I said.

D a -

A. The question is (stoit) in the following: that -- you see -- it is
hard to believe that a person ~= as they say ~=— who worked there Ill
years either tries to say that he does not know something or wants

‘to show that he knows.
B. No, what I know, I tell, only what I know.

A. Between us, the SAVCHENKO who was in the Ukraine, in Intelligence
and so forth and so forth, Sergey Romanovich, everyone (vse sobaki)

in the whole world knows him.
B. Well, tell ((me, if it is)) no secret.

A. Everyone also knows that SAVCHENKO whom you do not know -- or wish
to say that you do not know -- because his name is everywhere in the
newspapers, without any cover; the question is (stoit) in the
following: that, you understand, if you do not know what happened
with the SAVCHENKO who was chief of Intelligence, etc., if you do
not know that it is precisely he in Moldavia, then please do not

say....

B. ((Iinterrupts)) I am telling you what I know, as (kak) I know.

Why do you pose the question so?

A. I pose the question so, because there are two SAVCHENKOs, and
(Cit was)) not that SAVCHENKO of whom you speak ‘that was in Moldavia,
but quite another, and I want to pin down (podvesti) here that you as
an employee of 11 years must know the other, who also is a lieutenant

general, ((and)) why you do not know him.

A. let us suppose that there was still another (yeshche odin) SAVCHENKO.

Precisely this SAVCHENKO, who at one time was Chief of the First
Directorate, Chairman of the KGB in Moldavia.

And I do not know any other SAVCHENKO.

Do you know some other SAVCHENKO?

I do not know.

I think that this is that one who at one time was in the Ukraine

((the Ukrainian SSR)), a Minister.

Now we are talking about that one who was in the Ukraine and that one

who was chief of Intelligence, and so forth.

This one; he is in Moldavia, until recently (do poslednego vremeni)

in Moldavia.

I simply am asking, in a friendly way, are you certain of this or not?
It is precisely this SAVCHENKO ((whom)) I have in mind.

I now am asking: Is there another SAVCHENKO there?

I do not know, I do not know.

Have you ever heard of another Lt Gen (General-leytenant) SAVCHENKO?

I not (ne)... this one who ((is)) in Moldavia, Chairman of the KGB.

I simply am asking, have you ever heard of another Lt Gen SAVCHENKO?

I do not know.

I do not remember.

Let us assume that the SAVCHENKO who was chief of Intelligence and

worked in the Ukraine and, in your opinion, ((is)) Minister in
Moldavia, ((that)) his true first name (nastoyashcheye imya) ((is))

Sergey Romanovich....

I do not know.

... Lieutenant General....
Lieutenant General....

All the trouble ((is)) in the following, you understand -- you
already have repogated (povtoryayete) this several times and you
say that he was Minister in the Ukraine, and so forth.

You know that in Moldavia, the Minister for State Security or the

Chairman of the Committee for State Security, in your time and now --

to the present day -- is (sidit), or, in any case, last year, was:

Lt Gen SAVCHENKO, Ivan Tikhonovich.

(1G)... SAVCHENKO, what his first name ((Cis)) I- do not know.

But I do not know his first name.
You see, I want to say, when you are not certain or do not know....

((Interrupts)) So, but more I do not know the first name; I am

saying, SAVCHENKO....

You say that that SAVCHENKO who previously was in the Ukraine ((and))

then was chief of Intelligence, now he is Minister in Moldavia....
In Moldavia, yes, this one.

But I want to tell you that there is another Lt Gen ((SAVCHENKO)) and
not this SAVCHENKO, but ((another)) SAVCHENKO; I have given (nazval)
you both correct first names; in Moldavia, the Chairman of the KGB
whom you know as this one, the other SAVCHENKO, whose name ((is))

ivan Tikhonovich, who also at one time was a KGB employee and at
