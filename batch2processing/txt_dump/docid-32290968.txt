Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Ilona Marita Lorenz

The attached newspaper stories alleged that "Alex
Rorke, a wealthy adventurer who worked for both CIA and the

-FBI" was involved with Frank Fiorini, a "CIA Agent! who -fecruited

the subject in an assassination plot against Castro.

lexander I, Rorke is a former FBI clerical employee who, during
he time of the alleged plot in 1960, was a free lance :
hotographer. He had been temporarily detained by the Cuban
Government in 1959 and for many years was active in anti-Castro
activities in the Florida area. From time to time he contacted
the FBI and was dealt with at arms length because of his
adventurer, personality and self-serving motives. He disappeared
on a plane flight in 1963 to Central America. Frank Fiorini
also known as Frank Anthony Sturgis was well known to the FBI
for his anti-Castro activities in the U.S. following his=
defection from Cuba in 1958. He was also one of the Watergate
break-in subjects. :

Additional information in FBI files indicates that the
subject also furnished information concerning the July 26th
Movement in the U..S. This group was the original political and
military organization which Castro used to overthrow the Batista
Regime in Cuba. The subject was also interviewed in 1962 in
Florida regarding tas White Slavery Traffic Act (WSTA) case and
admitted being the mistress of Marcos Perez Jimenez, former
President of Venezuela, who fathered her daughter.” Investigation
failed to establish the subject was a victim in the above. mentioned
WSTA case. Aine subject [is ‘the present wife of NY °7511-IA who
furnishes information on~Soviet and Soviet-bloc matters. She...
is aware of her husbands cooperation: with the New Office! and
haS, on occasion, volunteered information of value he subject
is presently separated from her husband and in April, 1976, the
New York Office opened a potential criminal informant file on her
because of her contacts with a New York area crime figure,

Guiseppe Faggiano, and a.race horse trainer, She furnished
information regarding gambling, shylocking and bank robbery matters.
However, because of the recent publicity set out in the attached
newspaper clippings, the fact that she is planning to write a ‘book

_concerning her Cuban experiences and the fact that she terminated

her contact with criminal elements,her case was closed by the
New York Office. >
