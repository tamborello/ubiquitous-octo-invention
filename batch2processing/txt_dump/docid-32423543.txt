Lansdale Memo to AG stating need for strong decisions and evidence
of his support. Efforts of Agency so far have accomplished goal
re Cuba, “and I still feel that we might uncork the touchdown
play.independently of the institutional program we are spurring."
‘(emphasis added)

Lansdale memo Craig re “Operation Bounty" which establishes system
of financial reward comensurate wiht position and stature of victim,
for killing or delivering alive known Communists in Cuba.

 

Lansdale program review. Proposed plans for September will include
“an attack on the cadre of the regime including key leaders.

elements might provide the best recruitment potential for actions

against police -- G2 officials...CW agents should be fully considered."

Lansdale memo to SGA wiht basic plan of action notes "any inference
that this plan exists couldplace the President of the United States
in a most damaging position."

General Taylors guidelines will be reviewed and shown to higher
authority, "but in the context of information rather than a request
for specific approval." Rusk notes that "once the agents are within
the country they cannot be effectively controlled from the U.S."

Taylor guidelines for Mongoose sent to Lansdale in'draft form.

"Are responsible for performance : through normal command channels
to the President." (The word President" is crossed out and “higher
authority" is put in its place.)

Was this genuine concem
for lack of control? Was
what Harvey had done a
known example? (poison

did inconsistent with
control

Is this another example
of attempts to isolate
the President on the
record from the project?

Lansdale memo to Goodwin asking for alternate tracks Rusk sees
open to achieve Cuban objectives; plus list of pretexts Rusk
sees as desirable in connection with any direct military inter-
vention.

Lansdale tells SGA CIA urgently needs policy determination
"on the supplying of arms and equipment to deserving Cuban
guerrillas, as they are located, assessed, and request help.
Such requests are starting to surface...there is a need

for defining the limits of arming guerrillas (for self
defense, for training, for purposes shor of open actions in
revolt), to permit operational judgment to be used by ©
designated operations officers."

Lansdale memo to SGA says many agents infiltrated into Cuba
"will be trained for paramilitary skills as well as intelligence
collection...however, the CIA has noted that, once the agents
are inside Cubg, they cannot be controlled effectively outside
Cuba."

Craig reports to SGA that use’of BW/CW to incapacitate Cuban
sugar workers "infeasible and it was cancelled."

Taylor memo re meeting of SGA with President discussing Taylor's
guidelines notes "General Lansdale and the Special Group (Augmented)
were given tacit authorization to proceed in accordance with the

guidelines." . Footnote says: '"...group was unanimous in feeling
that no authorization, either tacit or otherwise was given by
higher authority." Footnote added one week later.

SGA meeting. McCone impatient. Group consensus is that time

has come to reexamine basic philosovhy of project with particular
reference to the possibility of finding a pretext for early
overt intervention. .

TOP SECRET ooo

President Kennedy in memo to Special Group summarizes
major decisions re Cuba Project and appoints General
Lansdale as acting Chief of Operattons.

R. Kennedy tells SG that "Higher authority" *i.e., the
President) has given priority to Cuba project and Lansdale
is to develop long range plan to be reviewed by SG and
submitted to higher authority for approval. .
Lansdale presents outline of program designed to overthrow
Castro regime. Uses Cubans as nucleus.

‘Lansdale sends R. Kennedy a copy of his program review of
same day and notes on an attached paper: "My review does
not include the sensitive work I have reported to you. I
felt that you preferred informing the President privately.

Lansdale memo reflecting on 1/19/62 meeting with AG.
Reflects L's own view of the severity and the importance

of the remarks of the AG re pushing forward vigorously with
Cuba Proje-t.. "We are in a combat situation -- where

we have been given full command."

Lansdale memo for Special Group notes it is difficult to
control indigenous nationals if the movement develops
its own impetus.

 

 

What was the nature of this sensi-
tive work? All plans were supposed
to go to the SG-2hy not these? Was
there a separate secret plan that
only Lansdale, the President, and
AG and a few others knew of? Was
this a manner of avoiding a
"reporting'' requirement?

Did this reflect the pressure that
Helms testified to that created
what he called a feeling that
“anything goes?" Yet McCone
continually complained not enough
being done, Why?

Was there concern that these
nationals if armed would assassi-
nate Cuban leaders? Were they
concerned that they could unleash
something they could not control?
Was this dangerous becasue we
couldn't control what followed
assassination?

Chronology of Events

 

1960
November 3

 

Lansdale present at Special Group meeting when Merchant

prompted discussion of "taking direct positive action

\ - . against Fidel, Raul, and Che Guevara." (SG Minutes)
Cabell said that kind of program not practical and group
decides not to adopt sucha plan.

1961

Oct 6

 

SGA told by Parrott of 2 "other contingency plans in
connection with possible removal of Castro from the
Cuban scene..." (Minutes of SGA).

Lansdale memo discusses major sabotage action. Indica-
tes that present means NOT likely to cause overthrow
of Cuban regime.

November 3

 

QUESTIONS AND ISSUES

Yet CIA had already made contact
with the Mafia. Was Cabell not
informed or was he being dis-
ingenuous?

Before the Rockefeller Commission
Lansdale denies that he was in-
volved in sabotage and said that
he and JFK and RFK tried to stop
sabotage. Clearly not the case.
