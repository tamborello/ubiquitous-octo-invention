THOMAS CACIOPPO, aka
AR
(OG Kansas City)

Re Las Vegas letter to Kansas City dated 7/2/62.

 

Logical investigation in Hansas City, Missouri,
falls to develop information indicating THOMAS CACIOPPO has \
returned to the Kansas City area since the middle of June 1962.

in early dune 1962, KC 737-C* furnished iniormation
veflecting that THOMAS CACIOPPO and his brother, CHARLES {
CACIOPPO, also known as CHUCKIE MORGAN, had a long and serious
discussion with NICHOLAS CIVELLA. The CACIOPPOS were complain-
ing that they bad recently been in Chicago, Illinois, and
attempted to visit an individual named "HUMP" (phonetic).
“HUMP” failed to recognize them or give them the usual courte-
gies. NICK CIVELLA explained te them that the reason for this
lack of recognition was because they had not indicated to NICK
CIVELLA they were going te Chicage prier to the trip, so that
NICK was unable to telephonically contact “HUMP™ requesting
him to give the ugual courtesies to the CACIOPPOS. Without
this previous word, ne courtesies are offered.

 

THOMAS CACIGPPG also complained extensively to the
effect that he did not feel he was getting his fair share of
money from NICK CIVELLA out of the profits of the organized
eriminal element in Kansas City, Missouri, HICK CIVELLA
advised CACICPPO he was getting his fair share, but the reason
he has 0 money is because of his gambling losses, not because
of curtailed income as his share of the profits.

On July 3, 1862, KC 315-C advised he had recently
learned that THOMAS CACIOPPO had been in Las Vegas for the
last several days prior te that date. He was unable to secure
any'information as to where CACIOPPO was staying or what the
purpose was of his being in Las Vegas.
