The regular Friday night S.W.P. Forum was cancelled
and everyone was invited to go to the central Methodist Church
located at Woodward and Adams to heap-—a lawyer named Mark Lane
give a talk about Lee Harvey oswaia.( 4) Ww

The talk was attended by about le. .~There was
several male a female negro's in the crowd Hw \
it. Mardebane said that if Oswald was deidd a€ the very “Jy;

beginning befone.jRuby_shot him he would have been acquited of

the killing of“Kennedy and He? also felt if he had lived and was NUS
tried today! he would be acquited. Lane also said that had Oswald
lived and been tried he could not have gotten a fair trial any ©
place in the United States as they had him judged guilty before F\y
his trial and this was a mockery of our judicial system which j
says a man is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond any Q c
reasonable doubet by a court of law. Lane then went on to say \S AS)
that he had checked the records and in his opinion Oswald was Q
innocent of killing President Kennedy. He said he checked : ~
statements of the doctors who worked trying to save Kennedy and R
they first stated the fatal shot hit. him in the throat and went £
down. If Oswald shot. Kennedy it would have had to be in the
back of the neck as the caravan was beyond the depository building. E
A few days later after the F.B.I. talked to the doctors, they ‘ eq
changed their story that the fatal. shot entered through the back . &

Lane said upon checking with the taxi company they never had
anybody work for them by the name.given. Lane then went on to
‘say that the police said it was.a german rifle that killed Kenne
but. changed it to an italian one like Oswalds. Lane also sai
checked with the manufacturer of the rifle and he said the ri
could not have done the job. He also said that the F.B.I. k
all about Oswalds past and he should have been picked up as
security risk. Instead on the day of the killing the F.B,1I. was
busy following and harassing the people in Dallas who believed

in school -intergration. ‘Lane said it was also proved that the chicken

show he was terribly nervous and that he. tried to kill a
policeman with a pistol he had but it misfired and the firing
pin left a mark on the bullet. After bullestics checked the
bullet and found it didn't have any marks on it the police
chief didn't refute his statement butsaid so it had no marks
on it and passed it off. As to Oswald being so nervous in
the show this was also a falsehood and he explained why. He
said after. the shooting a policeman ran into the bldg and .

‘while Oswaldwas drinking a pop put his gun in his ribs and _

Oswalds boss said that he told the policeman that Oswald

worked for him and that Oswald was not nervous at the time

but was extremely calm. Lane also said that after the.first
‘shot which one police office thought came from up a hill. and
from a different direction the police officer chased two people

but nothing more was said about it. Lane also implied that
there seemed to be a conspiracy between the Dallas Police and

Jack Ruby to do away with Oswald. Lane said because of the
importance of the case extreme care should have been taken for
Oswald's safety instead of putting him on display for anyone

to kill him. Lane said he was going to go around the country

- informing people of what had happened and not what they had
