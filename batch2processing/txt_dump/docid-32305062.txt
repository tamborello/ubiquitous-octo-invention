told him, "These are FBIs. They are no good s.o.b.'s, All the
FBIs are no good, none of them. This one (porn ane to photograph
of SA PETERSON) is the Captain (in Italian), he's a no good
s.0.b., and this other one here, he's no good s.o.b, too, You

be careful of these guys, all of them." Informant stated he
assured MALLAMO that he would. Informant asked MALLAMO where

he obtained the photographs and he stated’ they had been copied —
froma newspaper. “ :

MALLAMO appeared to the informant.as being very dis-
turbed, and in Italian asked the informant if the informant would
do hima big favor. The informant immediately told MALLAMO. he

‘would be happy to do him a favor, and MALLAMO told the informant - :
then that he would like him to come to the C.M.A.S, Club, 19 - {
Sth.Ave., that night, Sat., and act as a lookout on the door
from.9:00 PM to 2:00 AM, and he, MALLAMO, would be there by
11:00 PM, Informant agreed to do this, but could not see why
MALLAMO. needed him when his man, JOHN SALVATORE, would be working
in the club and would normally be watching the door. MALLAMO then
told the informant he was very upset over the fact that SALVATORE .
had been subpoenaed before the current Mahoning County Investigative
Grand Jury, and that it was possible that. SALVATORE could be con-
victed of something, and SALVATORE would have to leave the club..
Informant then told MALLAMO there was nothing for him to worry
about, even though he was convicted of something he always had ;
the right to appeal, to which MALLAMO replied, "Appeal with what, '
that takes money." The informant then told MALLAMO that he,

MALLAMO, could loan SALVATORE money for an appeal, and MALLAMO
told informant he would not loan SALVATORE any more money, and
then took a pencil and on a piece of paper wrote the numerals
"18," and said "That's what he owes me now, with three zeros
behind it, and I'm not loaning him any more money." :

° ‘Informant stated on 5/24/64, that on the night of
5/23/64, he watched the door of the C.M.A.S. Club from 9:00 PM
until 2:00 AM for MALLAMO, MALLAMO did not arrive until. about
11:45 PM, when he appeared with ANTHONY AULISIO, owner of the
Aulisio Fish Market, E. Federal St., Youngstown, previously
reported as a member of the "Calabrese Organization." MALLAMO
asked the informant how everything was, and informant told. MALLAMO
there was no trouble, in that he turned no one away from the door,
and yet he only had about 25 customers in-the club. Informant

then asked what MALLAMO was so worried about, and MALLAMO exhibited :
to the informant a list of about twelve auto license numbers, and '
told the informant these are for "FBI cars." He then told the

informant that he had one unmarked.police cruiser with two Vice

Squad men in plain clothes parked on 5th Ave. outside the club,

and another unmarked police cruiser with two Vice Squad men in

‘plain clothes parked in the parking lot opposite the C.M.A.S,

Club. If any one of these men spotted an "FBI car" in the

neighborhood, then the men in the car in the parking lot would ; oh
flash their spotlight up into the window of the C,.M.A.S. Club, ; :
and thereby alert the operators of the "FBI's" presence in the ;
neighborhood. Informant was questioned as to why MALLAMO would
possibly think that the FBI might raid the C.M.A,S. Club, or have
any interest in the club, and he stated he does not know. ;

On 5/21/64, cv 544-c advised that even though JOHN
SALVATORE is working for MALLAMO, he does not trust him working
for him. He stated MALLAMO has léarned that SALVATORE has been
operating a shylocking business with C.M.A.S. Club funds, which
money SALVATORE still owes the club, and to date MALLAMO does
not know exactly how much money SALVATORE has taken from the

-elub. CV 544-c also advised that MALLAMO would kill SALVATORE
if knew another thing, and that is that in keeping the books

of the C.M.A.S. Club, SALVATORE lists $75 per month for the
auditor, one (FNU) FORTINE, while he actually pays FORTINE only
$25 per month for this. Informant this could never.be. brought
out, in that he, himself, would be harmed if this were known as
there are only three persons that know this, SALVATORE, FORTINE .
and himself. | ; : ; oy OMe

Re: Prosecution in Local Mahoning County
Court of Common Pleas, Youngstown

> on 5/25/64, RONALD DAVID CARABBIA appeared with counsel
before Common Pleas Judge SIDNEY RIGELHAUPT seeking a motion for
anew trial, which Judge RIGELHAUPT denied. Defense Counsel
EDWARD L, WILLIAMS claimed that CARABBIA could not get a fair
trial since the CARABBIA name had been so prominent in the courts,
press and television several weeks ago when CARABBIA's older :
brother, CHARLES, was found guilty of assault with a deadly
weapon. Judge RIGELHAUPT ruled that in his opinion CARABBIA
had received a fair trial. He seta probation hearing for
