that information in government possession in respect to hood-
lums which we got from BROWN and RUSTON would, in any case,
be most properly presented to any Defense Counsel from the
files of the ATTD itself. ‘

The Bureau is requested to advise Albany in the
event it is desired the information in the memoranda regard-
ing BROWN and RUSTON be obtained from them on a current basis
with clearance to disseminate it. It is noted both BROWN
and RUSTON have been reported as having testified before. the
Special Grand Jury in the SDNY which returned the indictment
in U.S. vs. BONANNO, et al.

Both BROWN and RUSTON have been interviewed in
hoodlum perjury cases and their interviews reflected on
FD 302's were, of course, all furnished on a non-confidential
basis, after obtaining clearance and with the understanding
that testimony might be required and this, of course, presents
no problem, It is recommended that only the letterhead memor aiida
reflecting interviews with BROWN and RUSTON designated on pages
following as items 44 and 45 (BROWN) and item 111 (RUSTON) be
disseminated.

      
 

q

In respect to the Bureau's
attention is particularly directed to the fact that he was
formerly Confidential Informant AL 3002-C, discontinued by v
Albany letter. 3/24/59. Of course, he is known to the Attorney
General's Special Group at New York City and his name undoubtedly
has been mentioned in testimony before the Special Grand Jury.
In addition, he has been interviewed and carried openly in the
hoodlum perjury cases in the recent past.
