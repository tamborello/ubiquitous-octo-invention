MASFERRER. No personal contact with MASFERRER was believed
advisable because he is currently subject to the jurisdiction’
of the Federal Court in Miami (Judge CHOATE) in an immigration
matter in which he is protesting an INS order to move from
Florida to a place more than 150 miles from the Gulf of Mexico.
Notification of the possible threat was made in line with the
policy of notifying possible kidnap victims in matters of this
type to avoid possible future comment that FBI was in possession
of information affecting the personal safety of an individual
and failed to advise said person. JAFFE stated that he had
heard nothing concerning any possible threat. Chey

on 1/28/60, AUSA LLOYD G. BATES, “JR. was advised
by letter of the filing of the complaint against the subjects,
the issuance of a warrant for their arrest, the subjects arrest
and the fact that no criminal record was known on either sub-

| ject at the time of arrest. He was also furnished information

for the preparation of an Information of Indictment.

The Federal agency to which CATHERINE TAAFFE refers
in her signed statement is CIA. She insisted on putting this
information in her statement.

\ - MM 639-S advised SA ROBERT JAMES DWYER on 1/29/60,

that he received information that CATHERINE TAAFFE told

\ FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ COUCEIRO that the FBI Agents who arrested
\the subjects were hiding in the bathroom of her hotel room
lwhere the arrests were made. ‘This, of course, is not true,
and TAAFFE, in fact, had no knowledge of the place where the
Agent was going to meet VALDES. a2) U

 

MM 639-S advised SA DWYER on 2/1/60, that he called
FERNANDO COBA, Lt., Confidential Section A (intelligence unit)
of the Cuban National Police, Havana, and told COBA of the
arrest of the subjects. He said COBA was very excited and
wanted TAAFFE's telephone number. He said it appeared that
COBA is acquainted with TAAFFE and was going to call her. G(r)

MM 639-S also advised that he called Lt. COBA on
2/1/60, and COBA was already in possession of information .
that TAAFFE had moved from the International Airport Hotel
to the Miami Colonial Hotel, Miami. COBA told the informant
that TAAFFE set up the kidnaping attempt on behalf of the
U. S. police because if she had not she would be in jail
with FERNANDEZ DE CASTRO and VALDES. COBA also commented
that ii wasan entrapment because TAAFFE had called around
Havana trying to recruit people to help her in this kidnap

plan (uy)

: Following his arrest VALDES signed*a waiver of
search which permitted a search to.be made of his hotel room
and his property therein. During the search, certain letters
and papers were located which may be pertinent to this case.

. No evaluation of these letters has beén made as yet and there-
: ‘fore no mention of them is made in this report. 'A-Yeceipt for

the material was obtained from VALDES and is being kept in the
files of this office together with the waiver of search.
