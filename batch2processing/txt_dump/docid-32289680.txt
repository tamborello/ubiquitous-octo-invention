On 4/17/63 NY 3936-C advised that Jack Me Carthy operated

 

a labor consulting firm in the NY area and had extensive contacts

with both the criminal element in NY and with highly placed union
officials. It had been alleged that Me Carthy had an intense dislike
for Frank Chavez. Mc Carthy had indicated that Chavez had taken a
"contract"and murdered two revolutionists in the DR.. In doing this,
Chavez incurred the wrath of the NY criminal element because he

handled this "contract" at a mtich cheaper rate than the NY people
would have handled it. Me Carthy described Chavez as an individual

who would "murder anybody for a price." =

 

Further, Mc Carthy had been informed that there were many
people who would pay money to have President Duvalier of Haiti murdered.
He stated that he would speak "to people" regarding a "contract" to '
kill Duvalier.

After Local 208, Local Freight Drivers, TU, in Los
Angeles, California, filed its Labor Organization Financial Report
for the period September, 1958, to October, 1959, with the US
Department of Labor, W. Blaine Patton and Charles Ira Brenner, members
of the local, discovered that for years local funds had been diverted
to pay personal contributions of the local's officials' pension fund.

On 8/1/60 Patton and Brenner filed charges against Sidney
Harry Cohen (159-512), Secretary-Treasurer, who ran the local.

A series of events happened to get Brenner and Patton to
drop the charges. One of these was a visit by Frankie Chavez from
PR to see Brenner in early October, 1960. Chavez promised Brenner
a job with the Teamsters in PR if he would drop the charges. Brenner
agreed to this offer but decided later not to take any job in PR
after he was told that if he went there he would be of no further
use to the Teamsters and would probably end up in the bay.

who was heading the organizing drive of the Teamsters in PR, came
to NY and instituted a picket line in Brooklyn to embarrass the
Seafarers Union. He stated that the Seafarers were making a strong
attempt to organize labor in PR. Chavez was opposing this drive
