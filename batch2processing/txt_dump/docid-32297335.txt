RE: MOVIMIENTO DEMOCRATA CRISTIANO
(MDC) (CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT)

VEGA advised that DAVIS was named MDC delegate in
New Orleans, Louisiana for the purpose of distributing
anti-communist propaganda and the collection of funds for
the organization. The MDC Headquarters in Miami has not
heard from DAVIS in over eight months, ad does not know if he
is still working for the MDC.

VEGA. explained that DAVIS does not participate in
the military action group of the MDC, and no way represents

' it. VEGA explained that the MDC does not have any aircraft,

none have been offered to the organization, and the
organization in no way has made any plans to conduct bombing
raids against the oil refineries in Havana, Cuba. VEGA said
that such operations are prohibitively costly and extremely
difficult to carry out because of Federal law enforcement in
South Florida. -

MM: T-1 has been active in Cuban revolutionary
activities for the past seven years, and is closely
associated with the military operations of the MDC, MM T-1,
on June 26, 1964, advised that at the present time BATISTA
FALLA: is outside the United States with two boats, possibly
conducting some military operations against Cuba, and that

-his whereabouts is unknown.

MM T-1 stated that because of recent raids by local
police and United States Customs Agents against the MDC,
the organization established a_secret military headquarters

. at 837 Southwest 29th Avenue. [ANGEL VEGA resides there with

five or six other military action group members and a quantity
of arms and ammunition are stored at this residence |(g

On June 30, 1964, MM T-1 advised that VEGA operates
a Sonar 40 Transceiver (transmitter- receiver radio) at the 6
