7 Summary & Partial Translation re
Writer starts her long 7-page letter with an inscription on top ‘of

i the page ! "My confession to you Galka (dimimtivefrom Galina, Writer

further states “quite a long time passed since I received" ‘wonderful?

‘Letter from you.. However I am not angry at you. Your reaction has
‘been quite normal. I decided however to wait with my reply. This

morning and the previous days I thought S====r= whether it is worth while

. to write to you again," Writer then continues wondering what the Russian

newspapers had written about her and feeling hurt: that addressee had

: . forsaken and apparently criticized her in her previous letter which she
’ believes also a consequence of some news items that addressee had read

about writer. Writer indicates that addressee should know her better

: . than anyone else because they were so close for such a long time. She
 peminisces about the time they spent together and reminds addressee that

when she obtained her first job, the first thing she did was to buy
addressee a present. Writer further tells addressee that her conscience

' ds clear and that she does not have to apologize to addressee for anything,

however she would like to hear from addressee and to continue their friend-

oo ship, which is of course, up to addressee to do. Writer repeats that she
. is the same and has not changed since they parted. Evidently in reply to
. addressee's reproaches. writer states that she is not "money mad", she .
. must However think about her two children and for that reason since
reporters somehow got hold of her husband's diery and published it, she —

then agreed to let LIFE Magazine publish the diary with her remarks for
which she received renumeration. This money will help to educate her ~
children and will enable them not to depend on other people. Writer

calls addressee's attention to the fact that the children have a "mark"

- against them and for this reason she has always to think about them
_ first. Writer further indicates that addressee apparently reproaches

her for not returning to the "homeland". Writer points out however that
things are not as simple as it looks from afar. It appears that addressee
suggested that writer should not have taken any money from newspapers.
Writer states that it. is easy.to talk about humanitarian deeds and ideas

'- but it is difficult for one to act on a high plain when one is faced with
“the problem of feeding oneself and little children. Writer then discusses
oy performance of the Leningrad ballet in New York and indicates that she is
