to be’ originals, because: First the Italian
Goverment will never let them to be exported,

and second all Europe would of being fighting to
obtain them for their musseums. From this statement
I amd under’ the impression that all this paintings
are false & imitations, and Mr. Ranchella and Mr.
Lorenzi were only out to take the money from the
letter of credit and that was it. Thanks God that
the letter of credit was not funded, because if

at this moments we are having troubles to have
Ranchella return the letters of credit, that do.
not belong to him, suppose how difficult will be
to have those bandits return the cash.~ Also
attached as atached #22 several letters, cables,
etc. that will hel to coraborate what I have said.
