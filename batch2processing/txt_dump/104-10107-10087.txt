MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. I showed Mr. George Carey his memorandum of 1955

to the Director referring to T. and H., and said we thought

that H. referred to a General Hardin. After considerable

speculation Mr. Carey finally placed T. as being Juan Trippe

and Hardin as an Air Force General who was being placed with
24 (for operational reasons, primarily technical information

collection. Independently Mrs. Lovejoy had checked with Mr.

Larocque, and he also recalled General Hardin was a man

Mr. Carey was interested in placing with for operational

reasons.

 

2, The Air Force Register lists a General Thomas O.
Hardin, Air Force Major General, who retired in 1955, which
would seem to fit in as he is listed as an airline executive.
Mr. Carey had no knowledge whatsoever of the Itkin case, and
we felt it was out of the question that General Hardin is

synonymous with Philip Harbin.
