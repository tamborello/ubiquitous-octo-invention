By letter dated January 19, 1961, the Bureau
informed that CIA, by liaison; had informed the Bureau ; i
on. January 6, 1961 that subject was in no way connected
with CIA. ; :

; Reference is made to Bureau airtel dated i
January 16, 1961 to Seattle and Miami, pointing out that ;
the Department was requested by letter dated December 16, |
1960 to advise whether a thorough investigation were | ;
warranted and desired by the Department. It is noted ; \
that the Bureau pointed out, among other things, that |
no additional investigation concerning this matter should
be conducted until an opinion is received from the Depart-
ment. Miami, therefore, is conducting no active investi-
gation. concerning subject, but is reporting the information
which has come to its attention through established informants
and sources.

Complete information concerning the theft of the >
tugboat "Gil Rokie," from Miami on February 4, 1961 by
some of subject's associates, was reported to the Bureau in | ul
report of SA JAMES D. HAYES at Miami, dated February 20, oe
1961 in case captioned: "KENNETH JOSEPH PROCTOR, et al, -
Neutrality Matter." Certain portions have been extracted
from that report and appear in details of this report.

 

Information copies of this report are being
forwarded the Norfolk Office and WFO, inasmuch as they
may be called upon at some future time to conduct
