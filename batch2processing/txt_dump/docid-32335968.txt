- ADMINISTRATIVE -

This report is classified secret because it contains
information [from CIA which has been classified by that agency ue
as secret/and in the event of down-grading it is suggested this
report always remain classified as confidential in view of the
fact that fitecontains information from a Legat of the United
States, thus reflecting Bureau investigative interest outside
of the territorial limitations of the United States.

Consideration at one time was given to possible
development of subject as a PSI in connection with Cuban matters i
due to subject's voluntarily furnishing information upon and
subsequent to his arrival in the United States in 1959. However,
subject was dropped from such consideration upon receipt of
information that he had been involved in two murders (Bureau
letter to Legat, Havana, 9/4/59).

It should be noted that the source that furnished
the letter which subject sent to Cuba Police Chief EFIGENIO
AMEIJEIRAS, was PSI RICARDO MADAN (MM T-3 in this report.
