GALINS advised that any law enforcement agency
other than Federal agencies, licensed with the FCC are
assigned radio frequencies, the identification of which
is readily available by law through the FCC upon personal
request of an official at any FCC office. He further
advised that frequencies are designated to law
enforcement agencies in various parts of the continental
United States so there is necessarily much duplication
by way of frequency assignments.

He advised that frequency 154.800 is assigned
by FCC to the Broward County Sheriff's Office (Fort Lauderdale,
Florida), Dade County Sheriff's Office (Miami, Florida),
the Orange County Sheriff's Office (Orlando, Florida),
Deming, New Mexico, Police Department; and the New Mexico
State Policee He advised that the only assignment of this
frequency in the State of Illinois is to the Decatur,
Illinois, Police Department. He indicated that this. frequency

was probably assigned to other law enforcement agencies in other’

states, and this wasnot meant to be an exhaustive listing
of the assignments of this frequency.

He further advised that although frequencies
assigned to Federal investigative agencies are classified
information, any electronics expert can very easily determine
frequencies assigned tovwarious agencies by monitoring.
communications on the various frequencies.
