the Italian criminal Organization, the Bureau ig coasidering
the recommendation of new legisiatien te cope sore effectively
with thia organization, its leaders and ite uembers. The fact

purposes, in laying grouadwoerk fer the conclusive estabdlishueat

ef these nenber-seources hag furnished Substantially identical
accounts of initiation, oath, and rules will be of great
significance. This will be particularly true cGnsidering that

1930. Of similar significance is the fact that these accounts

were received frou Zeurces, unksown te one another, as far

It can be appreciated that the aspects of initiation,
@ath, rules, and permanence of the organization which will be of
greatest weight will be these which, ef themselves, suggeat
contravention of certain previsions of the U. 3. Constitution
