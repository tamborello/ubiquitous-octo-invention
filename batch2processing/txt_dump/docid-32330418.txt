re is little likelihood informant will divulge relationsip

with PBI since such action would sersously Jjeopardizehis own

safetyo Under circumstances, it is felt we should not take any
precipitous action to manipulate this matter for the wenefit of

UM 635-S or exert any influence on his behalf. It is believed, however,
that we should furnish informant's account to Department and to U. Se
Attorney, Miami, who is handling case (we have previously advised both
Department. and U.. Se Attorney of fact Fernandez has been paid Bureau
informant). Department should have this information to handle any :
he BO may arise if Fernandez does divulge his informant relation- |

Possibility exists that Government may decide not to

carry through on prosecution in this matter, especially since hey
Government witness would be Urse Gatherine Taaffe who is of dubious
reliability (we have also furnished Department full facts concerning
her}. Government may decide not to try subjects in favor of having
| | them deported. In any event, it is felt we should await outcome

of future prosecutive deve opments before making decision as to future
operation of MM 635-Sé ¥ 4)

Attached for your approval is letter’ to Criminal Division of
