Re Havana letter to Bureau dated February 6, 1958.

Continuous contacts with the following individuals

part in Havana: .

Casino, Hotel Nacional, who is personally acquainted with
both subjects ;/

ARTIE NEWMAN, Credit Manager , (Gambling Casino,’ ~

Havana-13;

Lt. JORGE PENA HERRERA, Head of the Alien Controk |
Section, Department of Investigation, Cuban National Police

: No additional investigation concerning subjects
is contemplated by the Legal Attache, Havana, until such
time as information is received indicating that subjects
have renewed their activity in Havana. In this regard it
should be noted that detailed review of incoming and out-
going flight manifests covering any extended period of time
is not feasible since the Alien Control Section of the De-
partment of Investigation does not have personnel available
for such a project. Such a check can be made-for a specif}
date or for a period covering only a specified few days.
