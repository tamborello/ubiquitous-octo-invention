nn oe The ‘following report «a9. received from Rolando MANGUART Juila,
4 | AMOT sub-source in Havana: a :
ay 1 wrote you ina previous: report about my efforts to unite

the different clandestine groups in the weotern provinces
of Cuba. A sintlar effort «111 .de made in the eastern

 

Ep provinces, I believe that the coming neek I shall be able
| : to give you a detailed report about the work that has been 1

done.

2. At this moment xe are masking an inventory of the arma we
ean count on, and when the tine comes, I shall tell you
what war materiel »#e shall need ‘and, the places where it
oan be recelved. I hope it may ‘be possible to receive
aid (from. you), as the work which I have been doing 18
considerable and I have nevar asked anything of you. I

se : 24 : have. done everything by myself. . But this 15 a nation-wide

, thing «hich requires funds and certain commitments, .

3. Don't think that the sane thing 19 going to happen that
happened to the 60
and later the 110,000 pesos sent to solve thé problem of
Humberto SORI Marin. These funds-never reached their
destination “and were canaged by Hilario,.Polin, .and’ Boris,
-Hilerio took asylua in an embassy, and tho other two sere

 

[does go on. I mention namea so that youcean check
It 16 certain.that the last two nentioned

 

detuined but they have conforts which other prisoners do not
get. There {8 a statezent which they made which Bayo that
over there (meaning Mi ani?) they were told that there were
three different persons in Habana - AMRUNG-1, Hafagl, and pw 4
‘R-12 (does he. mean biuself?) and that the last person wag eat
_not "a man of confidence”, but the first two were the 4
appropriate ones (los indicados). As soon ag AMRUNG~1,

Rafael and SORI srrived here in Habana I w88 @aare of the

i fact and could have got in touch with them at any given tine,

} I did not do so because I did not need to see them. On the

: other hand they did not know me or know where to find me,

 

which is a eign that J «as working better and had a better
intelligence service than they did. I feel they did not have
confidence in me or perhaps thought Icould not be of service
‘ “to then because of ny little experience and youth. They did
not give me any help and‘did not let me use any of the sar
| material that was offered re, 1 want to demonstrate to you
: . that I am capable of doing the sawe. kind of work, and I «ant .
} ~you to recommend me to those gentlemen, whom God keep in glory!
