MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence .

SUBJECT: "| Rolando Masferrer Trial

 

1, This memorandum is for information. ,

2, During the past year we have spent a good deal of time
working with the Department of Justice and the U. S. Attorney in.
Miami on possible problems in connection with the trial of Rolando
Masferrer which begins on 6 November 1967. Masferrer was’
arrested by Bureau of Customs officials for violation of the
Neutrality Act when he and a number of other Cubans and some
Haitians were about to embark on an expedition against Haiti.

An indictment was obtained shortly thereafter against Masferrer
and certain selected members of his band. Neither we nor Justice
was informed of the arrest ahead of time, but we raised a question
with the Departments of State and Justice as to whether there
should be an indictment. State's strong desire for prosecution.

of this particular group prevailed o over our worries.

3. We see several areas of - possible trouble for us. From
.the start, Masferrer has indicated that he would claim that the
Central Intelligence Agency knew about and endorsed the expedition.
In fact, practically everyone in Florida, including CLA knew about .
the expedition, but our Station made every effort to keep away from — -
it and any Cubans and Haitians associated with it. Our association
. .with Masferrer started in the late 1940s but.was cut off completely .
‘in the early 1950s. Certain members of the expedition, however, .
: had had more recent contacts with the Agency.
?
_  & The second area of concern arises from the fact that
certain individuals associated, directly or indirectly, with
Masferrer have also cropped up in the Garrison investigation

in New Orleans. We cannot predict any specific problems heré
except that information developed in Miami may well be grist
to Garrison's mill.

: 5. Another point involves one David Cabeza, who has
‘done fairly extensive work for us and may be called as a witness.
He would probably be willing to talk about his activities for us

if such testimony were admissible in evidence. Hopefully the
Government lawyers can prevent this.

6. The defense has stated it will call as a witness
Cesario Diosado. He is a Bureau of Customs official who became
os so involved in working with us that for the past few years we
/ a have been reimbursing Customs for his salary and he has actually
, '" been under our direction, He participated in the arrest of
Masferrer and the others. It is possible his nelatlonship with
us will come out during the trial.

. 7. All of these points have been discussed in detail with
the Department of Justice in the hope that it might drop the
indictment. It is under pressure from two points, however,

The Department of State very much wants to get a conviction under

, the Neutrality Act, particularly after the failure of the B-26 case
in Buffalo last year. Obviously, the Masferrer case looks like
an ideal one to prosecute from its point of view. Secondly,

_ CBS worked with Masferrer's group and apparently filmed all
the preparations. It has been cooperating with Justice and has

- supplied its film to the U. S Attorney. Since this apparently

|. Act, Justice feels there is no logical explanation it can be given for —
dropping the indictment. As our worries are purely speculative
and we cannot predict with any certainty that we will be involved,
I do not believe we have sufficient ammunition to contest Justice's.
position. Justice has spent a great deal of time studying our
problems and certainly will make every effort to control the |
‘situation insofar as we are concerned.
