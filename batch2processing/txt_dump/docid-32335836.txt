The following information is supplemental to the
information furnished in letterhead memorandum of September 7,
1965.

The following information was furnished on September 21,
1965, by Dallas T-1: ;

Dallas T-1 advised that approximately 15 people had
attended two meetings of the American Underground during the
middle part of August, 1965, at the home of Delbert Ray in
Midlothian, Texas. Dallas T-1 stated that he had heard that
these meetings lasted approximately one to two hours and
involved discussions concerning how the U. S, Government was
infiltrated by members of the Communist Party or by individuals
who are sympathetic to the goals of the Communist Party.

Dallas T-1 advised that at one of these meetings
approximately one hour was spent in target or practice shooting
with pistols by several members of the organization. ‘Dallas T-1
stated that he was quite certain that Otto "Duke" Koling, and
Arthur Pollard attended both of the above meetings. Dallas T-1
stated that he did not believe that the group was attempting
to recruit any additional individuals to attend meetings of the
organization and he did not know of any pians formulated by the
group.

Dallas T-1 advised on October 25, 1965, that activities
have been very quiet within the organization and as far as he knew,
no meetings have occurred since the middle of August.
