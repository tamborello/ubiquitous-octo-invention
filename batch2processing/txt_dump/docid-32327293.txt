She. graduated in 1949 from Galena Park High School, Houston,

Her file disclosed she is 5'5" tall, weighs 122
lbs., has blue wes and his a blond. Mr. .AMOS stated that
because of her exceptionally attractive appearance, Miss
BRITT has been used on occasions by National Air Lines as a
hostess at various official receptions.

“, Mr. “AMOS said that Miga BRITT formerly roomed with
JUANTTANRERNAND EZ and PATRICIA ANNXGANF ORD, also National
Air Lines hostesses, but that some time ago they split up, .
and that Miss BRITT- now’ shares a room or apartment with Miss —
SANFORD Following this split.up, Miss FERNANDEZ reported to
Mr. AMOS ‘that she was concerned about Miss BRITT because of
the, fast company she had begun to associate with. Mr.
AMOS said that up to this point he has never had occasion to
Call Miss BRITT to task for any unbecoming or questionable
“ activity. He said that he had heard that CARLOS PRIO had
been seen in the company of some National Air Lines hostesses,
and had made several gifts of fur coats. He believed that
Miss, BRITT may have become acquainted with PRIO through
DOR. EYON, also a National Air Lines hostess who is the
only Ciitban National employed by this airline. Mr. AMOS
said Miss ALEYON is the daughter of a very wealthy Cuban
family, has been with National Air Lines since'1949, is
extremely well connected in Cuban circles, and has the
reputation of having given some rather lavish parties attended
by prominent Cubans in Miami.

~ Mr. AMOS said he had no reason to question Miss
BRITT*s loyalty, reliability and integrity. He pointed out,
however, that his relationship with Miss BRITT is that of .
emplo: >reemployee, and that he was not intimately acquainted
with her. : .

: .Records of the Miami redit Bureau reflect that Miss
BRITT previously resided 2106 2n Street, Galena Park, Texas, -
and that her mother is Mrs. R. R.AMcKEOWN. Her credit record

contained ng derogatory informatio
: A check of the records of the Miami Beach Police

Devartment , Midmi.Police Department, Municipal Court, and
the Dade County. Sheriff's Office failed to disclose any
_ record of Miss BRITT. ; ae _—

foe Phe indices of the Miani Office are negative
..-melative to Miss BRITT with the exception of the information

   

. earya*fied in the PRIO case which reflects that she is
undoubted]: carrying .an a clandestine, intimate affair with
cy eae ; a

~cos.. x It fs believed that Miss BRITT could undoubtedly
furnish information of value concerning PRIO's general ,
activities..-In view. of the Latin custom of dalliance, it is
very doubtful. whether PRIO has any deep interest in Miss
BRITT, and there have been some indications that he is also
playing around y another unidentified woman. Information
received througRRMM 510-S and Mi 51 Si se does not reflect Br
that Miss BRITT Ts actually in love PRIO, but is merely :
Carrying on this affair for other reasons. PRIO is known .
to be a free spender, and it can be assumed that he has -
undoubtedly presented her with some rather expensive gifts (i )

 

. - In view of the relationship between PRIO and Miss
BRITT, the possibility cannot be ignored that she might :
advise PRIO of any contact made by this office or through

an intermediary for information relating to PRIO. At the

Same time, however, in view of her position with National |
Air Lines, and the nature of her relationship with PRIO, it

is felt that there‘is a very good possibility that she would
be willing to cooperate with this office in furnishing informa-
‘tion concerning PRIO and his immediate plans (Ku) :
