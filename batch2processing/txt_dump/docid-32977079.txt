Dear Walt:

Attached are copies of Exhibits 2952 and 2955
to the Warren Commission Report. Exhibit 2952 is a
letter from Mr. Hoover to Mr. Rankin in which he states
he contacted a representative of CIA about a message
turned over to CIA by Dr. Portell-Vila.- An interview
of Dr. Portell-Vila about the contents of that message
. is Exhibit 2955. It should be noted that on May 22,
OQ 1964, the CIA representative said the message was not
_thought to relate to Oswald, so CIA's files on Oswald
might not contain this message. The staff has not
been able to locate any material relating to this matter
in CIA files on Oswald on the President's assassination.

° Therefore, we wish to obtain a copy of the message and
all documents relating to it. We also wish to obtain
copies of all documents relating to the May 22, 1963
contact which presumably was with Mr. Hoover or someone
else in the FBI. We suggest that if the message is not
contained in any files on Oswald or the Kennedy assassina-
tion, the files of the other individuals named in the
two exhibits should be searched.

ayy :

Bl Bader
