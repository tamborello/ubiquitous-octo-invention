‘4, te him. ALEXANDER then commented that he had known for several
'. years that a photegraph of LANE as the subject. of a masechist
rite was in existence and that be (ALEXANDER) has acquired this
photograph recently from an undisclosed source in New York.

ALEXANDER continued that MARK LANE had been critical
of Dallas authorities and the FBI and had caused a lot of
trouble for Dallas authorities, -He stated that if MARK LANE
should return to Dallas he would he confronted with this
photegraph.

. SA CURTIS viewed that photograph which depicts a man
nude, with his arms taped behind him, sexually aroused, and his
sex organs being tertured. :

A photograph of HARK LANE contained in Dallas files
was viewed by SA CURTIS who states that if the man in the
photograph exhibited by Mr. ALEXANDER is not MARK LANE, such
individual bears definite sinilarities to him.

Copies of this communication are furnished the New York
Office for information as that. office was fermerly the office
of origin in the LANE case and may have some knowledge of the
existence of a photograph of LANE as described above.

The foregoing information is furnished for the informa~
tion of the Bureau,2i:2 New York and New Orleans and will not be
Submitted in LHM for dissemination, UACB, as to disseminate such
information it is felt eontact with ALEXANDER would have to be =~
made as he indicated he was exhibiting the photograph “eonfidentially".
To indicate to ALEXANDER that this bureau had an interest in MARK
LANE is not considered advisable, inasmuch as ALEXANDER was a
somewhat controversial figure in connection with the investigation
concerning the leak of information to the press concerning OSWALD's
diary during the course of the assassination investigation.
