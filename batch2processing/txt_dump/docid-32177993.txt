It is believed by the Mexico City Office that an

interview of CHARLES SMALL by Mexican authorities would be
highly undesirable for the following reasons:

The only information concerning SMALL's reactions
and statements concerning OSWALD came from[MBX-18 and MEX~ [uy]
19. t+ is extremely difficult, if not Impossible, to con-
t he Mexican police and if that information was passed
en to them as the basis for an interview, there is no
assurance that they would not reveal it to the subject.
Such action would probably result in SMALL's recognizing
the informants as the source of the information, thereby
Gestroying their future utility and embarrassing the
operations of the Bureau in Mexico

“very. concerned over the assassination of President KENNEDY
‘and the isivolvement of OSWALD, who was connected with the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC). Although she did not
indicate which organism of the PCN had reached this decision,
_it is to be’ noted that MORA was a‘member of the so-called
‘Leadership Branch of the PCM. She stated that the PCM had
decided that there were only four American in Mexico who
might possibly be involved. in FeCC operations as far as

the Mexican police might know: ASA, ZATZ (Bufile 105~16890),
CHARLES SUALL, and the informants.

. ‘ As. the Bureau is aware; the informants, came to. the
attention of the Mexican authorities when HELEN LEVI TRAVIS
(Bufile 100-336032), who was admittedly a member of the FPCC,
was arrested and deported in November, 1962, “At that time,
the Mexican police found the.informants' home address and
telephone number in TRAVIS! motel room and it was necessary.
for the informants to go into hiding untL the: Mexican. police
gave up efforts to interview then. %)

 

On 11/23/63, MORA advised the informants that if
any action was taken against them by the Mexican police, .
they should immediately get in touch with, JUAN MANUEL
GUTIERREZ, the Mexico City attormey whom the informants had
previously been. instructed to contac in case they were
arrested Por political yeasons. wu): ;

Under the above circumstances, therefore, any
request of the Mexican police to interview SMALL on.the basis
of his relations with members of the FPCC would. foc the
attention of those authorities on fae, 18 and MEX-19,/'% well Cus
as on SMALL, with the possibility ‘that the Mexican Bolice,
Ywho, as pointed out above, are difficult to control, might
also take action against the informants.

Consideration has also been given to calling SMALL,
who is an American citizen, into the Embassy for interview..
it is not felt, however,; that such action would be advisable
since any interrogation. by Embassy personne including this
office, woyld necessarily e to be predicated on informa-

a heart - condition, claims to have suffered a Blight. heart
attack while in the United States in September, 1963,’ and is
in poor health. ‘Information received from CIA, Mexico, clas- Cul i
» ified: "SECRET" dnd not to be disseminated outside: the Bureau,
\” also’ confirms SMALL's reported heart: condition: and his :
\ frequent ,cdaims that he has to be very careful not to aggra-
vate as ageressive interview of SMALL by either the,
Mexic Olice er American personnel might either. percipitate
another heart attack. or cause the subject to claim another such
attack and accuse the Bureau. of being responsible for it.

In addition to. the above factors, the Mexico city
office has no information to show that such an interview,
either by the Mexican. police; or the American officers would . :
be productive. Available sources have given _po indication
that SMALL actually ever: knew or saw OSWALD. ¥ His claim that
he must have known OSWALD at some time and that he might ;
have met OSWALD in Mexico was,according to{MBX-18 and mex- 199
based on the fact that many American communT8ts visiting
Mexico go to SMALL's store and that he assists them in con-
nection with their problems while visiting Mexico eae 48 '

 

SMALL, however, has given no indication that he
recognized OSWALD from the newspaper pictures printed in
Mexico City or recognized his name as being one of the
visitors at his store. The informants have reported that
following the. assassination of President KENNEDY and the i
public identification of OSWALD's leftist connections with ,
the FPCC and his former residence in the Soviet Union, the
American communists in Mexico were extremely fearful, expect+
ing police harrassment of all leftists. They considered
SMALL's concern over the possibility that OSWALD might have
visited his store to be part of the general concern of all
American communists here after reading that OSWALD had been
in Mexico. No information has since been developed to the
contrary.

In light of the above, the Mexico Clty Office does
not belteve that an interview of SMALL should be undertaken ,
by either Mexican or American officials. ,
