DL 92-34

On July 8, 1958, it was determined that 2930 Forest
Avenue, Dallas, was a Negro rooming house and has been 80 for
the past three years. Tenants JESSIE SHELTON and BERTHA JEAN
LEMMON both advised that they knew of no white female named
Mrs. J. B. HUDSON having resided at that address for the past
three years, From the above it appears that Mrs. HUDSON used
a false address when she registered at the St. Angelus Hotel,
San Angelo, Texas, in November, 1957.

On June 18, 1958, Dallas Confidential Informant T-7,

pusher and addict who was dealing in narcotics with ANGELO
THOMAS CASTEN, when TOWNLEY and TOWNLEY's wife mysteriously
disappeared from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. T-7 stated
TOWNLEY at that time-was obtaining pure heroin from CASTEN and
that based on her. knowledge and association with police
characters in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, T-7 was of the
opinion that TOWNLEY and TOWNLEY's wife were murdered by
ANGELO CASTEN, HARRY POPE, and a third unknown individual
believed to have been GENE PAUL NORRIS, over a narcotics
argument. T-7 stated she had no definite proof concerning
the above but that it was merely an opinion.
