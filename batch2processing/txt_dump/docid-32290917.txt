Detective GRAFF further advised he closed out this phase of
his investigation as to the ANASTASIA killing as being based
on unreliable information. GRAFF noted that it was a policy
of the District Attorney's Office in New York County that _
no indictment would be issued until‘that office is ready to
apprehend those named in the indictment and therefore, no
Federal UFAP process is contemplated in connection with the
ANASTASIA homicide. He said he would notify the New York
Office of any indictment returned in this ANASTASIA case.
