9. It must be stressed that what technical information the.
Station had was not (and normally is not) processed in "real
time." The means of acquisition and the volume of the infor-
mation preclude anything but the spot reporting of items judged
to be of more than ordinary interest and, therefore, noted in
summary logs. Full texts of selected items require consultation
of the tape and eithér a full transcription or full translation
or both. . Photo coverage tends to become available in quantity
lots which requires scanning and selection on a rapid and
accelerated basis. in four or five day "peaks." One of the
"triggers" that normally operates to focus and accelerate more

_speedy review and reporting of this kind.of raw intelligence is
' the mention of a name. This was precisely what occurred in the
second of two conversations on 1 October, during which the
speaker said he was "Lee OSWALD." It was this information
reported by the Station to Headquarters in its first indication
on OSWALD on 8 October 1963.

10. The Mexico Station did one more thing in its 8 October
report on Lee OSWALD based on the T October information: it
coupled the data with. descriptive information it had acquired
from a sensitive source -- a photograph of a male individual,
apparently an American, who was observed entering an Embassy
on 1 October. The Station reported this detail on the 8th as
a matter of coincident fact. The Station did not assert or

suggest that the data led to any deduction that the photo was in

fact OSWALD or, indeed, was in any way related to OSWALD.
