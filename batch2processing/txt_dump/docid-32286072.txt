Chicago crime syndicate, has to be considered as an undesir-
able person. Therefore, the competent Swiss authorities
dealing with foreigners are now entering into the case of :
ALEX with regard to an interdiction of entry into Switzerland,
as further entries of ALEX into Switzerland are anticipated,

The Bureau is requested to confirm arrival of ALEX '
in the U.S. and inform appropriate Legats. }
