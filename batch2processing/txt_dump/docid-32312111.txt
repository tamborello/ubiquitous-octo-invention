claim for damages to the amount of no less that 5000 D.kr.
was rejected. In this case JORGEN JACOBSEN acted as counsel

for MARK LANE. (s)

In 1966, MARK LANE, who in the meantime had

Married a Dane and temporarily settled in Denmark, published
a book entitled Rush to Judgment, the substance of which is
that the murder of the President was not the work of a single
individual, but a conspiracy. Based on this book, a
documentary film was subsequently produced.

At the Congress, JORGEN JACOBSEN met the American
lawyer MARK LANE, who in his capacity of chairman of the
"Citizens' Committee of Inquiry" was working on an
independent inquiry into. the murder, having no confidence in
the material prepared by the Dallas Police.€$ )

Between JORGEN JACOBSEN and MARK LANE cooperation
was. established on this draft resolution, which, incidentally,
was adopted by the Congress. This cooperation was developed
further, and led to the establishment in Denmark of a so-
called "Mark Lane Committee" for the purpose of collecting
abl available information on the assassination of the
President and. informing the public of any hushed-up or
suppressed details concerning the murder. §

Following the Congress, however, MARK LANE himself
went to Denmark, where, in the "Lawyers! Debating Club," —
the "Students' Association" in Copenhagen, and the "Students!
Society" in Arhus, he told about his inguiries so far, aiming
at proving that reactionary, fascist circles were behind the
assassination of President KENNEDY .(¢")

The Danish "Mark Lane Committee," which may be
considered as long since dissolved, comprised a total of 16
individuals; the founder, JORGEN JACOBSEN, is known as a’
Communist, whereas the others mainly belonged to cultural, _
left-wing literary circles. However, the activities of the
Committee, mainly based on MARK LANE's inquiries in the
United States, failed. to bring forth any sensational i
disclosures. The work of the American authorities on the |
case was, on the other hand, criticized and the port of
the Warren Commission was denounced as a fraud. S

 

In connecti.:n with the references of the Danish
press to this matter, in November, 1964, the "Berlingske
Tidende" published an article, the contents of which MARK LANE i
considered defamatory. The result was a libel action against
the newspaper, and. on Nevember 11, 1965, the High Court found
the statements cf the paper ill-founded. The responsible(s)

CEORGE LANE stated that it was his distinct
impression from his contact with MARK LANE. that MARK LANE
is an agitator who is interested in stirring up racial
disturbances, particularly in the Arcadia and Immokalee,
_ Florida, areas. GEORGE LANE stated he has brought the above
information to the attention of DeSoto County Sheriff
FRANK CLINE, Arcadia, Florida.

 

GEORGE and VIRGINIA LANE advised that during
their meeting with MARK LANE and CAROLYN MUGAR, they j
received the very definite impression that MARK LANE and~
MUGAR are romantically involved, although MUGAR appears
much younger than MARK LANE. MUGAR appears to be a "wild,
"hippie'"’ type, and during conversation she indicated that |
she assists MARK LANE as a photographer. ;

GEORGE and VIRGINIA LANE advised that besides the
interest which MARK LANE and MUGAR evidenced in the
RICHARDSON case, they also appeared very interested in any
trouble spots in Florida, such as Negro unrest and
mistreatment of Indians.

On October 29, 1969, a confidential source abroad
advised that during the month of October, 1969, an organization
known as the “English Language Committee" was created in Paris,
France, with the objective of opposing the continuation of |
the war in Vietnam, as well as the following additional |
objectives: (s) oe “s

    
   
 

.1) Opposition to ‘nuclear armament;
2) Opposition to American imperialism; (s)
3) Action in favor of recognizing Communist China

4) Activity against racism in the United States
and throughout the world. (%)

Source further stated that during a meeting held
on October 15, 1969, at the American Center for Students and
Artists, 261 Roulevard Raspail, Paris, France, an initial
impetus was given to the English Language Committee by (s)

MARK LANE, a lawyer and American writer( S) s)

 

nother Government agency which ~-
conducts investigations‘abroad: advised that on. Si
November 14, 1969, MARK LANE was the main speaker at a
teach~in against the war in Vietnam held at the University
of Munich, Munich, Germany. This meeting was attended by
400-600 individuals, and in his speech LANE likened the
atrocities of the Nazis at Dachau, which he had visited, to.
those allegedly committed in Vietnam by American soldiers
and South Vietnamese supported by American soldiers. LANE
played a tape-recorded interview with an American deserter,
the grandson of General JOSEPH STILWELL. LANE also
discussed alleged resistance within the U. S. Army to the
war in Vietnam, claiming that the "brass" was going to
extremes to stifle dissent. LANE asked his German audience.
to assist those soldiers who want to desert or fight tne
Army "brass" from within. Finally, he declared that he was
returning to the United States. within a month, although he
feared ts (BO prosecution for providing assistance to

 

deserters.
On December 3, 1969, a second confidenrtizxl source
abroad furnished the following information concerning

MARK LANE: ( S)

The Communist-front organization "International

“Association of Democratic Lawyers" (IADL) held its 8th Congress

in Budapest during the period March 30-April 3, 1964,

attended inter alia by a delegation from the Danish Section

pot the IADL. ) One of the delegates was a Copenhagen lawyer ‘
named JORGENJJACOBSEN, who, prior to the Congress, had
collected some material concerning the assassination of
President KENNEDY. This material was to be used for a

draft resolution to the effect that the Congress was tc
advocate unbiased’ inguiries into the circumstances surroun-
ding the assassination and the sequel to it. (s)
