“George Bush” in question. CIA is now checking whether the search query
included George Herbert Walker Bush prior to 1970. CIA should determine
whether George Herbert Walker Bush is the person to whom the memorandum
refers and should provide a definitive statement regarding the scope of its search
and the basis of its conclusion.

CIA-IR-10 IG Reports.

CIA will determine whether the IG’s office maintains an index or inventory of its
reports and determine whether the IG’s office prepared a report on the handling
of Oswald.

CIA-IR-11 Warren Commission critics.

We are asking that CIA determine whether it possesses any files or records on
Warren Commission critics Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane,
Harold Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher. The Review. Board is not requesting
information per se regarding : any FOIA requests by these individuals or any
Public Affairs news clippings.”

CIA-IR-12 Contacts with journalists or publishing houses.

The Review Board seeks to determine to what extent, if any, CLA might have
attempted to influence any journalists or publishers regarding public discussion
of the assassination. This request, originally discussed in March 1997, was raised
at the DO follow-up briefing on April 1, 1997. The DO had no response and no
time frame for a response.

CIA-IR-13 Office or person dealing with organized crime and Cuba.
The Review Board requested that CIA make a particular personnel file available.

The file was made available by CIA for review. The Review Board will discuss
with you whether any further steps néed to be taken.

CIA-IR-14 Breckinridge files.

CIA (OGC) will determine the disposition of the files of Scott D. Breckinridge.

*CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City Station.

The Review Board has for some time been attempting to determine whether it
has had access to all of CIA’s surveillance “take” from the Cuban and Soviet
facilities in Mexico City at the time of the Oswald visit and in the immediate
wake of the assassination. On numerous occasions, the Review Board has asked
whether there was any surveillance take in addition to what is currently in the
collection.

On March 18, 1997, the Review Board provided additional leads to CIA to assist
it in answering these questions. The DO has agreed to check Headquarters
records for the file referenced in HMMW 12454, to search for the crypts cited in
this document, and to search for HMMA 20307 and other cables or dispatches
cited in this document. The DS&T will query its offices for possible records on
Mexico City and Cuba and for the present location of Staff D records. Regardless
of the outcome of these particular searches, the Review Board continues to seek a
full accounting for all surveillance conducted during the relevant time periods.

CIA-IR-16 U-2 files.

DS&T will provide a folder title print out of U-2 materials for Review Board
examination, check for records filed under Richard Bissell’s name, and search for
OSP files. DSé&T has also contacted Lockheed for assistance.

CIA-IR-17 DS&T Records on Castro assassination plots.

HRG will furnish the 1967 IG Report to provide possible search query
suggestions for DS&T follow-up. :

CIA-IR-05 Possible foreign source for records on Oswald.

CIA was informally requested, more than two years ago, to use its contacts to
pursue certain records related to Oswald that were orally described to CIA. The
Review Board believed that, for reasons of security classification of information,
it would be appropriate for CIA to make the initial inquiries rather than the
Review Board. Under separate cover, we are providing documentation of the
action the Review Board has taken to further this request.

CIA-IR-06 QKENCHANT.

The Review Board seeks information regarding the purpose of ORENCHANT
and its connection with Clay Shaw, Howard Hunt, and Monroe Sullivan.

The Review Board was initially provided some information in regard to this a
request that now appears to be incorrect. CIA is now seeking additional

information to correct or to clarify its previous answers. The Review Board seeks

an immediate, full, and accurate response to this 5 request.

CIA-IR-07 Claude Barnes Capehart.

The ARRE staff has reviewed all records that CIA has been able to locate.to date.
During the course of this review, additional questions were raised that you
agreed to pursue. You also agreed to conduct additional searches to determine
whether there may be additional retrievable records on Mr. Capehart.

CIA-IR-09 George Bush computer search.

The Review Board provided CIA with a copy of an FBI document, dated
November 29, 1963, prepared under the name of John Edgar Hoover, which
states: “The substance of the foregoing information [on the assassination of
President Kennedy] was orally furnished to Mr. George Bush of the Central
Intelligence Agency ....” We have been informed that the DO has no record of a
“George Bush” being in the employ of CIA in 1963 with the exception of Mr.
George William Bush who has already given a sworn affidavit that he is not the

This request, originally made in November 1996, was raised at the DO follow-up

briefing on April 1, 1997. It is our understanding that the DO believes that it is

suggesting the types of files and cables that could be searched.

The cable was delivered to the Review Board on March 20, 1997. No further
action by CIA is needed.

CIA-IR-03 Full computer search for list of documents in HTLINGUAL file.

CIA should undertake a computer run for all HTLINGUAL documents. All
computer searches for these documents should be documented in a formal letter
for the record.

CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton’s files.

The Review Board seeks to ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to
account for any files that James Jesus Angleton possessed or controlled that
related to the assassination and to Lee Harvey Oswald. Because of the perceived
controversy surrounding the disposition of Angleton’s files, the Review Board
believes it prudent to obtain a clear understanding of the types of files that he
maintained and their ultimate disposition. (The Review Board does not seek to
explore any subjects in Angleton’s files beyond those that may have pertained to
the assassination.) To date, CIA has made available certain documents provided
by the CIC and the case files for Mangold v. CIA. The Review Board requests any
additional information in the possession of CIA that would explain the
disposition of Angleton’s files.

CIA-11 Sylvia Duran materials.

CIA reports that it has exhausted its reasonable leads for pursuing additional
information. CIA has agreed to provide a formal letter for the record detailing
what searches were done and confirming that the responsive document currently
in the JFK collection is a true copy of the original letter. Once this formal
statement is provided, this request will be complete.

CIA-12 JMWAVE and David Sanchez Morales.

On May 22, 1996, the Review Board requested access to “all 201 files, personnel
files, Office of Security files, P-files, or any other files” relating to five persons
allegedly connected to JMWAVE. It is our understanding that, in response to
this request, several months ago CIA located and made available for our review

As we have written in our formal requests and as we have said to you orally, you
should interpret our requests in the broadest reasonable sense. However, to the extent
that you believe that a request poses an unreasonable burden that we may not have
anticipated, or to the extent that you have suggestions to modify or to amend our
requests in such a way as to better reach our goals, you should not hesitate to make
suggestions or seek clarification. However, unless we specifically hear from you to the
contrary, it is our presumption that CIA will respond fully to the requests as posed.

In response to your request, the ARRB staff has now identified six of our outstanding
requests as high priority issues. We would appreciate your forwarding to us as much
responsive material as you are reasonably able to assemble during the upcoming two
weeks with regard to these six issues. We wish to obtain a reasonably complete
response to these requests within one month. These six issues are identified in the text
by double asterisks (**).?

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts involving first, the formal requests
for information and records, and second, the informal requests for information and

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Compliance
Program and Requests for Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:

Iam writing to memorialize the Review Board’s understanding of the status of CIA’s
responses to our formal and informal requests for additional information and records
that have been requested pursuant to the Review Board’s authority under Section
7(j)(1)(C)Gi)of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994) (JFK Act). ‘

It is important that everyone at the Agency who is responsible for providing answers to
our requests for additional information and records understand that the answers will
need to be incorporated by reference into the Agency’s Final Compliance Statement.
Essentially, CIA will need to attest, under oath, that it has made all reasonable and
diligent.searches and that its answers are true and correct to the extent of the best,
reasonably available information. In this regard, is important to note that when the
Review Board requests, for example, a 201 file, it is not asking that you identify relevant
records within the Sequestered Collection. Rather, it is asking to review the original
201 file in its current and most complete version.

'The Review Board has no basis for assuming that.a 201 file as it appears in the
Sequestered Collection today is necessarily complete. It is fully possible that a relevant
document was not identified by CIA or the HSCA in 1978-79 and therefore is not
included in the Sequestered Collection, or that a relevant document that was initially
placed in the Sequestéred Collection in 1978-79 may have been misplaced at some point
during the subsequent twenty years. Therefore, in response to requests for files, it is
not sufficient merely to point to places where responsive records appear in the
Collection. On a case-by-case basis, we are very willing to hear your explanations for
the possible burdensomeness of any particular search or your analysis of why a search

historical understanding of the assassination by providing some background on
CIA records.

CIA should now review the DO and DS&T organizational material and
re-examine some of the proposed redactions. Several documents have been
cleared by the directorate IRO’s for either release in full or release with minor
redactions.’ The ARRB staff will consult with CIA to determine whether these
records should be designated “assassination records” or whether they could be
made available publicly in a manner similar to the material from the 1996 Boston.

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches.

    
 

The Review Board first made this request on September 11, 1995. On September
11, 1995, CIA agreed to make these materials available by December, 1995. On
October 1, 1996, CLA agreed to make these materials available by November,
1996. ‘

We are aware that many of the cables requested are already in the JFK files, but
not all are included. Those that we have not been able to locate in the collection
include: Mexico City Station to Headquarters (September 26-30, 1963);
Headquarters to Mexico City Station (September 26-30, 1963); JMWAVE to
Headquarters (September 26-November 21, 1963); Headquarters to JMWAVE
(September 26-November 21, 1963); and all traffic between the Mexico City
Station and JMWAVE for the periods September 26-October 20, 1963 and

Nov 22-December 30, 1963.

iew Board first requested access to several internal CIA histories and to
indices of histories on November 8, 1995. On August 8, 1996, after reviewing a
list of histories that you provided, the ARRB staff designated approximately
sixty histories for which further review was sought. To date, the ARRB staff has
reviewed the seven histories that CIA has made available and has made
suggestions with respect to further processing of those seven histories. CIA
should make the remaining sixty-plus histories available.

CIA-8 Intelligence Community Staff records.

The Review Board first requested information on the Intelligence Community
Staff on March 1, 1996. On October 1, 1996, CIA agreed to report on the status of
this request within two weeks. The Review Board has not yet received any
substantive response to this request.
