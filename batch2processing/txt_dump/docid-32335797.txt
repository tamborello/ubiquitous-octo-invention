It is to be noted that referenced communications
contained leads to interview RICHARD W, DAWSON and OTTO "DUKE"
KOLING at Fort Worth, Texas.

On 7/15/65, DL 269-PSI advised SA GARRY OWEN WATT
that he was quite certain any additiona} interviews with indivi-
duals associated with instant group, at the present time,
would more than likely uncover him as an ‘informant, [nfor-
mant advised that the interview of GRADY R, TURPIN by an
Agent of the FBI had not only left TURPIN shaken by the
experience but also suspicious of informant's activities.
Informant -stated that he flt certain that TURPIN had .
communicated tis ‘suspicions to other members of the group, .
and any additional interviews of members of the group would i"
seriously curtail his effectiveness.

Continued contacts will be maintained with DL 269 |
and all other pertinent investigation will be conducted
in regard to the group, but it is not felt that any additional ‘
interviews at this time would be in the best interests of the
Bureau.
