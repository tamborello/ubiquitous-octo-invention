ADMINISTRATIVE

JOSEPH KONOWE (T-2) advised that he is a personal
friend of VICTOR RIESEL, that he knows RIESEL has accepted
gifts from HYMAN POWELL of the Jewelry Workers Union, and
that although he has no positive evidence, he felt that RIESEL
was on DIOGUARDI's payroll in some way or another,

KONOWE stated that DIOGUARDI had paid RIESEL's
expenses for a trip to Miami in the winter of 1956. When
questioned further on this point, KONOWE said, "I haven't
§een the actual hotel bills. Don't ask me how I know. I
know. This is more than a presumption", (It should be noted
that it has been previously reported that RIESEL has exhibited
cancelled checks covering his stay in Miami Beach, Florida.) -

. KONOWE said that he believed that DIOGUARDT may
have taken a contract from someone higher up, or that DIOGUARDI
and RIESEL may have had a personal falling out, because RIESEL
' may have double crossed him in some way. "ye stated that if
DIOGUARDI had taken a contract, that he must not have known
that RIESEL would have been nit with acid. KONOWE expressed
the belief that DIOGUARDI and RIESEL had probably had a

personal falling out. \
