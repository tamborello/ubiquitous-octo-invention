By William Safire

WASHINGON, Nov. 18—On Oct. 10,
1963, the then-Attorney General of the
United States put his personal signa-
ture on a document that launched and
legitimatized one of the most horren-
dous abuses of Federal police power in
this century.

In Senator Frank Church's subcom-
mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and subse-
quent unauthorized bugging and at-
tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther
King Jr. is being gingerly examined,
with the “investigation” conducted in
such a way as not to unduly em-
barrass officials of the Kennedy or
Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has

- focused on the F.B.1. Yesterday, when?

the commitiee counsel first set forth
the result of shuffling through press

clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-:
partment had existed in 1962; today,

an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it
was Robért Kennedy who authorized
the wiretap of Dr. King, and that “the
President of the United States and the

_ Attorney General specifically discussed

their concern of Communist influence
with Dr. King.” .

But the Church committee showed
no zest for getting further to the Ken-

. nedy root of this precedent to Water-
* gate eavesdropping. if Senator Church

- were willing to let the chips fall where

they may, he would call some knowl-
edgeable witnesses into the glare of

_ the camera lights and ask them some

questions that have gone unasked for
thirteen years.

For example, he could call Nicholas
Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-
nedy’s deputy and successor, and ask

‘what he knows of the Kennedy de-

cision to wixetap Dr, King. Who at
Justice concurred in the recommenda-
tion? How does the F.B.I. know the +
President was consulted or informed?
After Mr, Katzenbach assumed of-
fice, and the wiretapping continued,
he was told by angry newsmen that
the F.B.I. was leaking scurrilous in-

‘formation about Dr. King. Why did he

. Johnson

wait for four months, and for a thou-
sand telephonic interceptions, to dis-
continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sort of testimony
would erode Senator Church’s political
base, That is why we do not see for-
mer Assistant F.B.I. director Cartha

' (Deke) Deloach, Lyndon Johnson's

perscnal contact with the F.B.I. in the
witness chair. What did President
know about the character-
assassination plot and when did he
know it? What conversations took
place between Mi. Deloach and Fresi-
dent Johnson on ihe tapping af Dr.

» King, or about the use of the F.B.1. in

 

any other jutrvsioas into the lives of

Desk digarest cota: 32989831 dR ePy

r. Church’s gover-U; Up

“The committee is not asking embar-
rassing questions even when answers
are readily available. A couple of
weeks age, at an open hearing, an

F.B.. man inadvertently started to .
blurt out an episode about newsmen 7.
who were weritapping in 1962 wit!
the apparent knowleage of Attorney
General Kennedy. The too-wiiling wit}
ness was promptly shooshed into si;
lence, and told that such information
would be developed only in executive
session. Nobody raised an eyebrow.
That pattern ot containment by the
Church committee is vividly shown by
the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican and Democratic con-
rmeenoer 0 aN Rn TARR

ventions which were ordered by Lyn- u .
don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-
cal headquarters were worse than the
crime committed at Watergate, sirice
they involved the use of the F.B.L,
but the Chirch investigators seem to
be determineti not to probe too deeply.
lf F.B.1. documents say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why are these men not given the
same opportunity to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent’s men? If Lyndon Johnson com-
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the F.BI. to spy on political 4
opponents, who can be brought for-*
ward to tell us all about it? ‘

But that wouid cause embarrass-
ment to Democrats, and Senator
Church wants to embarrass profes-
sional employees of investigatory
agencies only. A: new sense of Con-
gressional decorum exists, far from
the sense of outrage expressed in the
Senate Watergate committee’s hear-
ing room. When it is revealed that the
management of NBC News gave’ press
credentiais to L.B.J.’s spies at the 1964
convention, everybody blushes demure-,
ly—and nobody demands to know! :
which network executive made what}
decision under what pressure. |

T have been haranguing patient®
readers for years about the double
standard applicd to Democratic and”
Republican political crimes, and had
hoped the day would come when the
hardball precedents set by the Ken-
nedy and Johnson men woutd he laid
before the public in damning detail.

Obviously, Democrat Frank Charch
is not the man to do it. His. jowl-
shaking indignation is ali too selec-
tive; the trait of nigh-leve: responsi-
bility for the crimes committed against
Dr. King and others is evidently going
to he allowed to cool.

Piiy, You'd think thac after all the
nation has been through he pase
few years, our political would
have learned that the one thi
brings you down is the act of cover-
