.. LANE returned to England on June 9, 1964, arriving

at London Airport from Copenhagen, Denmark. He was ac-
companied by his fiancee, Miss ANNE-LISE DABELSTEEN, a
designer, born May 15, 1941, traveling on a Danish pass-—
port No, 2301698. Shortly after his arrival he attended

a press. conference at the Airport which had been arranged
by JAMES DELANEY GARST and at which LANE again expressed
his views on the Kennedy assassination, He. also told the
‘reporters that BERTRAND RUSSELL had written to him to say
that he wished to form an organization in England to be
called. the "Who Killed Kennedy Committee?". He went on

to say that the Committee had. now been formed, without a
chairman, but with GARST as secretary. They have received
some publicity in the British press, in particular in the
"Daily Worker" of June 12 and 30, 1964. According to LANE,
the objects of the Committee were to collect and disseminate
all available information and evidence relating to the as-"
‘gassination of President Kennedy and to insure justice for

. the Oswald family. T-1 has no information to show to what
’ extent the Committee is actively pursuing these objects.)
