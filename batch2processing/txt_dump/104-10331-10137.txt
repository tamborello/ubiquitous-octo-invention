MEMORANDUM FOR: F
cting ie

Clearance Division, OPS

FROM: J. Barry Harrelson
Senior Reviewer

SUBJECT: Requested “Mission Statement” re
HRP/ARRB

1. This is in response to your request asking that HRP
provide. you with a “mission statement” concerning HRP and
its relationship to the Assassination Records Review Board.
It flows from the fact that the ARRB staff has declared the
OPS files of Nagell, Novel and Ruby to “assassination
records” and our subsequent request that the files or copies
thereof be forwarded to HRP. Also, certain portions of the
files of Walter Sheridan and Harold Weisberg have or will be

declared assassination records.

2. The Historical Review Project (formerly the .
Historical Review Group, CSI, DCI) has among its several
projects the responsibility to deal with the presidentially
appointed Assassination Records Review Board and its legal
mandate to find and transfer to the National Archives all
U.S. Government records relating :to the Assassination of
President Kennedy. The authority of the ARRB is fairly
broad and includes: the authority to designate
files/documents “assassination records,” to determine if a
particular record or certain information within it must be
released to the Archives or postponed until 2007, and, the
power to issue subpoenas in the pursuit _ of its assigned
activities. :

3. In the instant case, the Board staff has designated
the Nagell, Novel and Ruby security files assassination
records. Copies of them must now be processed by HRP
according to its current guidelines for release/protection
of information and the files released to the Archives. With
respect to the files on Sheridan and Weisberg, further
review by the Board is necessary to designate which, if any,
portions of them are assassination records.

4. I hope that the above fulfills your requirement in
this matter and I look forward to receipt of the files.
