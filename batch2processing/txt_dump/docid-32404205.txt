addition to approximately 12,000 pages from the Oswald file
that were transferred to the National Archives in 1992. All
of the records in the Oswald file that can be declassified--
more than 90% of that file--have now been released.

related to the assassination and investigation are to be
released shortly. The records have been declassified under
the requirements of the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.
