NO 92-36 /sam

! MARINO sold some land he owned in Las Vegas and :
some land he owned in Kenner, La. This raised $50,000.

MARINO put down this $50,000 for a tract of land "on the
highway to Boulder City" in Las Vegas, Nevada. MARINO should
put up $50,000 more by 5/1/67 to complete this deal. At the

very latest, MARINO can wait until 5/17/67 and if he does not
put up’ $50,000 more. by then, he loses his $50,000.

CARLOS MARCELLO at first was willing to give MARINO
$100,000, allowing MARINO to pay his $50,000 debt and pocket
the remaining $50,000. CARLOS MARCELLO would then own this
deal. After negotiations with CARLOS MARCELLO, MARINO found
out that CARLOS MARCELLO would meet MARINO's deal only if
CARLOS MARCELLO gets exclusive control of the gambling
concession at this new hotel or motel. MARINO does not want
to give this concession to MARCELLO, therefore, negotiations
are at a standstill. Informant stated that MARINO is. very
perturbed at CARLOS MARCELLO's attitude.

Informant stated that MARINO was originally the
maitre d' at the Beverly Club in New Orleans when it was owned
and operated by FRANK COSTELLO and CARLOS MARCELLO. Upon the
closing of the Beverly Club, MARINO moved to Las Vegas.

Informant stated MARINO wears hearing aids. MARINO's
wife GLADYS was once in.a convent, however, she had to leave
due to poor eyesight. MARINO will leave New Orleans during
a.m. of 4/8/67 as he must be back at work during evening of
4/8/67. : :

MARINO being entertained by VINCENT and SADIE MARCELLO
(CARLOS MARCELLO's brother) during evening of 4/6/67.

 

DO NOT DISSEMINATE OUTSIDE THE BUREAU AS THIS WOULD
COMPROMISE THIS INFORMANT.
