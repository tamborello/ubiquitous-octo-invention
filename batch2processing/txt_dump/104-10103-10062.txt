The Mexican Government assured the U.S. Ambassador that it was taking

’ steps to control travellers and closed the border with the U.S. for
several hours immediately after the assassination. 3/ A flight of a
private aircraft such as this is possible but it is unlikely that such’
unusual activity as this would have gone unnoticed by the Mexico Station
team of observers who reported | on Cubana Airlines flights. 4/

4. Report not, substantiated by Mexico Station records: On -2 November
1964 the — reported that a source in Cuba claimed to have seen
an aircri with Mexican markings discharge passengers at the Havana airport
at 1700 hours on 22 November 1963. The source reported that the two passen-
gers "were gangsters" and that “the plane had just come from Dallas, via
Tijuana (where it was forced to land because of engine trouble) and "Mexico:
City." 5/ This information was sent to the FBI on 23 December 1964 for
investigation. 6/ The FBI responded on 31 December 1964 that Tijuana
would have been an unlikely place for a "forced landing" on a flight from
Dallas to Havana. Their office was making no further inquiries in the
absence of additional details from CIA. They suggested that CIA conduct
an investigation in Tijuana. 7/ (Tijuana is almost the same distance from
Dallas flying West as Havana would be flying Southeast or Mexico City would
be flying South.) The Mexico Station had no investigativ e assets in the
Tijuana. area, The information was a year old when received and much too
vague for retroactive checking of records. The untested source who had
provided the report died before he could be questioned for additional |
details.

5. The SSC V report page 103 further complicates travel data by the
listing of the Cubana Airlines flight delay from "6 p.m. until 11 p.m."
The writers of this report were probably trying to transpose the departure
time to the equivalent of Eastern time. Their information is dated 1
December 1963 which issprobably a mistaken reference to the cable which
is dated 30 November 1963. 2/ The Mexico Station file copy of this cable
carried the date of 1 December 1963 which.is the date it was received. 2/

SUBJECT : Flights from Mexico City to Havana on 22. November 1963

REFERENCE: 1. What is the total CIA information on the two flights |
from Mexico City. to: Havana?

2. What was done at the time to. develop further information
on this matter? :

3. Can further information be acquired on this matter now?

FINDINGS:

 

1. The Mexico Station records confirm only one flight from Mexico City
to Havana on 22 November 1963. This was the regularly scheduled Cubana
Airlines flight. There were two reports of small aircraft flights (one
a twin engine flight to Mexico City connecting with Cubana for onward
transportation to Havana of a mysterious passenger; and the other a flight
allegedly from Dallas, Tijuana, and Mexico City to Havana with two "gang-
land" type passengers.) Beyond the original reports (from sources of
undetermined reliability) there was nothing in the Mexico Station records
to substantiate that these flights occurred.

 

2. Facts substantiated by Mexico Station records: On 22 November
1963 a Cubana Airlines plane from Havana arrived at the Mexico City Inter-
national airport at 1620 hours - Mexico City time and departed on a return
flight te Havana at 2035 hours - Mexico City time. It was on the ground in
: Mexico City for about four hours which would be considered normal for servicing
ei . --for a turn-around flight carrying passengers in both directions. This infor-
are mation was obtained from sensitive telephone taps in the process of routine
operating procedures on 22 November 1963.

: 3. Report not substantiated by Mexico Station records: On 30 November
1963 CIA Headquarters cabled Mexico City that a report had been received

that the 22 November 1963 Cubana departure had been delayed five hours from
1700 to 2200 hours awaiting an important passenger who arrived at the Mexico
City airport in a private twin motor aircraft at 2130 hours Mexico time.
Passenger transferred directly te Cubana plane without going through customs
or immigration and travelled in pilot's cabin to Havana. 2/ This information
was passed to the Mexican officials on 2 December 1963 for investigation.
There is no record of a reply. We know from independent information in
paragraph two above that some parts of this report are in error. The Cubana’
flight was not delayed for five hours. It had departed for Havana from
Mexico City at 2035 hours which would be at least an hour before the twin
motor aircraft was alleged to have arrived in.Mexico City. The source's

name is on the manifest as a passenger from Mexico City to Havana but the
time supplied by him does not agree with other information considered reliable.
