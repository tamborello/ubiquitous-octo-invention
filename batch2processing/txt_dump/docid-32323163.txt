MORGAN thinks he can clarify this a little bit more heré
today; but it makessense, he observes. “ o

  

MORGAN comments that he got the impression from BOB last
night, [when he saw him at the [EmbassyfMthat he took a very -
lugubrious view of the situation; but (MORGAN) gathers from --
the papers today that Paris and London still: do not think.
in terms of the word "grave", :No, for one reason, LEBEL
replica that when one is dealing with Laos, oris dealing
with’ Laotians, and what would go for other peoples cannot
apply to an.absolutely charming people where the notion of
hate hardly exists; so that when you read that Communist |
forces have taken someplace, the news is not: good, but it.

I : is not as bad when it applies to Laos as if it applied
to someplace else, -,

 

 

The question which puzzles MORGAN is what to’ do from here #*
(this point), referring specifically to this busin of |;
alerting the fleet and all that. [EGBELts personadfebinton
is that alerting the fleet is an excellent thing Sfecause

two things may happen: either negotiation, and it is always
better to negotiate with a fleet behind you; or the opposite,
and then you need (the fleet) In any case, that is not

bad in itself, [LEBEL rep lic s@the problem is how one would

 

start some form of negotiation, and to what end, Fe

MORGAN gathers, (from having talked with issifang. From
some of these dispatches, that the revival of the (Inter-

national Control) Commission is -the first step toward getting
ome kind of neutralist government. -This is quite possible,
LEBEL replicg9 adding that he dogs not feel that he can >:
commit himself for his Government because he is not quite
clear as to the best possible procedural angles \ #/ ;

MORGAN, summing uff notes that the [French objagtive is a a
neutralist Government without the [Pathet 20;F put, he asks,
is this realistic? A fgw days ago this was {fhe French)»
position, LEBEL replies but now he has an interrogation |.

MORGAN explains that he was confused by the Times dispateh :
from London which said that both (U.S. Ambassador) WHITNEY -.:.
and (British Foreign Secretary) Lord HOME agreed that the
revival of the (International Control) Commission was. ;
necessary. Ashe gathers from here, Washington has: not .~
taken that view yet. [UEBEL, in reply observes hat. since
this is some thing which happened between others fhe is not .
the one to give a line on this Spout he thinks the truth is”
half-way between--that is, there is agreement on. princi ple, .
and perhaps there is not yet agreement on how to do it.,

 

   

MORGAN asks‘what the french answer] Mas been to! fhe American :
argument that to have’ a coalition government would be too vides
dangerous, that it would bleed the regime to weakness--

MORGAN explains that he is referring to a seemingly

illuminating dispatch which the Washington Post reprinted

from the London Observer last Thursday in which it was said

that many British feel that the Americans threw away a

golden opportunity of ‘restoring peace and political equildb-

rium to Laos when they failed to support SOUVANNA PHOUMA.

That sentence, (LEBEL replies} coulg,be trangferred one

hundred per cent to what ney feelin (eris SSOUVANNA PHOUMA
was never -really, supported here; [(the French) know the man)
quite weki,~ ‘and! if he had been (stpported here ) he would not
have turnéd to_the Left as he was oblig 4 do to reestablish
his balance. {In (France's) opinion, pad
(turned Left) too much, but the point is at he had to do

it beespee hefelt there was no support here,

-EBETY emphasizes that everything he is (sayi ng is for ba ge
ground (and not quotation)S¥” MORGAN accepts it as such, j'st

There was also, MORGAN continues, a report in the Washington
Post by this rather good reporter, WARREN UNNA, in which he-
said that there had been a hassle between (the U.S.)
Ambassador and CIA field wople on the one hand and Washington
CIA and the State Department on the other, that the field
people were wrging the support of PHOUMA t that they were
. overruled. {Useless to say, [{EBEL repliose if he were :
. ctoiouat ye that point he would consider himselfa jolly good

 

diplomat ut he could not say that what he has seen and
heard would urge him to disprove that story; he just does
not know any damned thing eC ites
