"El Condor" or nization Claims Credit

 

On 10/6/76, the "Miami Herald" received a telephone
call at 10 p.m., fronan individual who said the "El Condor"
organization was responsible for placing the bomb. This
call was received after extensive, news, coverage of the crash ll

There is no known "El Condor" organization in the Miami,
Florida, area, and the only previous use of the name "El Condor"
to claim credit for terrorist activities was by anti-Castro
Cuban terrorist, Rolando Otero in "Military Communiques," he
issued after several bombings in Miami in December, 1975.

Otero is in jail in Miami awaiting trial on these charges. Kk

This claim is believed to be without substance;
however, it has caused Caribbean countries to speculate freely
that anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Miami were responsible for
the crash of the airliner, .

On 9/30/76, Ricardo appeared unannounced at American
Embassy and requested assistance in obtaining a visa to U.S.
Since he had a photographic assignment for "Vision" Magazine
in Jamaica and planned a two-day stopover in Puerto Rico.
Ricardo stated that he intended to leave on 10/1/76 and

three days, requested Legat's assistance. |{

Legat broached the subject of Ricardo and of the faint suspicion
that Ricardo sm have been somehow involved in the bombing of
the Guyanese ‘Consulate in Port-of-Spain. The DISIP official
