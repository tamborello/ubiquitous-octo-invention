fo Me. Field: , Nowell

This is in reference-to-your~two-léttérs to me dated August 275
which request FBI materials relative to Donald Uffinger and Richard”
Bass, and interviews initth, five special agents of the FBI. While your

letter did not mention the subject of the interviews with the FBI
agents, we assume that. the .subject concerns Mr. Bast and Mr. SE EIBEE

 
 

As you may know, this. Devartment is involved in litigation A Gi
with Me. Bast in the District Court of the District of Columbia ~
styled: ‘Bast v. Kelley.’ Departmental policy precludes release of
iy ‘ormation which may impair the. Department's position in any :
pending litigation. Your requests: also touch upon matters which
are currently the subject of a criminal investigation by the Depart~

a ment. Department of Justice policy precludes: release of information

: which may impede any ongoing Departmental investigation. Certain
exceptions to thésé polities ‘have -been.made for the Senate Select
- Committee when special arrangements have beén agreed to which ensure
that neither the Department's litigative position nor its criminal
investigation will ‘be jeopardized. We would be pleased to discuss
such special tention wits relative to the pending Titigation a and
