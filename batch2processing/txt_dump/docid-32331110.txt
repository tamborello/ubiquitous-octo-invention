NOTES:

Legat, London, relayed request of Scotland Yard for information
regarding subject and associates who appeared in London, about 3/6/62.
Several offices have furnished information which was summarized in cables
to Legat on 3/15,20,22 26/62. . Field has set out considerable additional
leads not directly related to Scotland Yard request. It is believed
this investigation should be handled as part of the A-R matter now
that Scotland Yard queries have been answered. This was discussed
with General Investigative and Special Investigative Divisions and

they concur. .
