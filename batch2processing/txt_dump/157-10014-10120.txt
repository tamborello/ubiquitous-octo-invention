MEMORANDUM
To: Paul Wallach
From: Bob Kelley

As I mentioned to you, Senator Mathias is making an in-
vestigation of his own as a member of the Select Committee, as
permitted by Committee procedures, into the aspect of the possi-
ble connection between Operation Mongoose and the JFK assassina-
tion. .

In this connection, he is interested in obtaining. any FBI
documents concerning contacts. between a Cuban exile, Jose Aleman
and FBI agents, among which were SA George Davis and Paul Scran-
ton. He understands that in.1962-1963, Aleman had regular meet-
ings with Santos Trafficante which Aleman reported to SA Davis
and Seranton. In particular, Senator Mathias is interested in
any documents relating to a meeting between Aleman and Davis
and Scranton on November 22 or 23, 1963,(the day or the day
after the JFK assassination). Also, Aleman may have had a meet-
ing with FBI agents on April 17, 1971 (the day of the Bay of Pigs
Invasion).

I would appreciate, it if you would make a request to the
FBI for material relating to the above.

Re: Executive Session Testimony of Edward P. Morgan
and Hank Greenspun .

Attached for your review is a copy of an article captioned
“Fidel Castro ordered Jack Kennedy's Death", as it appeared in
the March 1, 1976 edition of the Las Vegas Sun. You will
note that Hank Greenspun wrote “evidence in my possession...
provides a clearly marked trail leading to logical conclusions
as to why the Kennedy brothers were killed. That path leads
straight to the door of a vengeful Castro."-

At the instruction of theCommittee, Fritz and I have
for the past two weeks attempted on a daily basis without
success to contact Greenspun telephonically. A telegram
was also dispatched to Greenspun on 3/8/76 indicating the Committee's
‘interest in discussing the evidence in his possession. The full
Committee unanimously approved a subpoena for Greenspun.

The Committee also approved a subpoena for Washington
attorney Edward Pierpoint Morgan. Morgan was the attorney of
.record for Messrs. Roselli and Maheu in 1967. It would appear
that he was the source of the Drew Pearson 1967 assassination
article which preceeded (some might say precipitated) the 1967
IG report. It was also Morgan's information that led Pearson
to go to Chief Justice Warren on January of 1967. Recently
received FBI reports indicate that at President Johnson's urging
the Bureau reluctantly interviewed Morgan in April of 1967.

. The reports recount that Morgan's clients had told him in detailed

I called Sharon Faucet (sic) of the LBJ Library in
Austin this morning and informed her that Epstein and I saw
Marvin Watson at his home in California, and that Mr. Watson
showed us about four file cabinets in the basement of his
home which he represented to contain his papers from the White
House. I also informed Ms. Faucet that Watson had said he was
moving back to Texas at the end of May and would deposit those
files in the Johnson Library.

I also requested Faucet send the Committee the Library's
public statement regarding Johnson's taping system and the list
of Marvin Watson memos/FBI memos dealing with the Garrison in-
vestigation withheld from research because of derogatory material.

I also asked Ms. Faucet to check the Library's materials
for any meetings involving Helms between March 19-23, 1967, and
April 24-May 22, 1967. . Faucet promised to check and call me back
at mid-day. She also mentioned that the President met with
Defense, State, and CIA every Tuesday to discuss national security
affairs, but there were no memos of these meetings until late .
1967. .

Ms. Faucet also informed me that Dick Jacobs, Deputy
Archivist for Presidential libraries, was the Archives' official
in Washington who: would be handling our document request from

Austin.

“Ret Oswald in New Orleans.

This morning I called (504/821-2000) "Chief"

-Giarruso of the NOPD for the purpose of determining whether

Oswald was arrested in New Orleans other than on August 9,
1963. Lt. Hunt transferred me to Major Earl Burmaster's,
explaining that he was the "keeper of records".

; After explaining that we were merely asking a
question that had not been asked (and not investigating ..
the NOPD) I inquired as to whether there were any other
arrests (or records).on Oswald. Burmaster called me back
and suggested that I call Sgt. Wenstein in the Intelligence
Unit (ext. 311). I spoke with Sgt. Wenstein who promised
to get back. to me. .

At 3:30 p.m. I called Wenstein again. He was
out of the office, but had left the matter with Sgt.
Loicano. - He was most cooperative and with the Oswald file -

in hand stated that the "rap sheet" revealed only the
August 9, 1963, arrest. (Included in the documents per-
taining to said. arrest was a memorandum by Lt. August
Lang, and an August 12, 1963, "inter-office memo” to

Major. Prossens.)

; I thanked the Sgt. for his cooperation, leaving
my phone number should anything else come to this attention. ..

RE: LBJ LIBRARY/KENNEDY ASSASSINATION

Sharon Faucet of the LBJ Library called me back this
morning about my inquiries of May 12, 1976. Ms. Faucet checked
Library materials to determine if there were any records in-
dicating what was discussed at a May 10, 1967, meeting attended
by Johnson, Helms, and George Christian. Faucet told me that the
"Diary Back-Up" Records have a.note about the May 10, 1967,
meeting which reads "Richard Helms wants to see you about Drew
Pearson colum.”

Faucet also reported that there were no memos reflecting
a March 22, 1967, meeting between Johnson and Helms, Cater,
McPherson, and Gardner. Faucet said the meeting probably was
about the Katzenbach academic study and possibly about the Guam
conference which occurred the-week before.

I again listed the materials Faucet promised to send the
Committee: .

1) List of Helms' meetings in the White House during

the Johnson administration; .

2) Copies of Johnson's Daily Diary Logs for March

19-22, 1967, and April 24-May 23, 1967;

3) Pink sheet listing Marvin Watson/FBI memos regarding
