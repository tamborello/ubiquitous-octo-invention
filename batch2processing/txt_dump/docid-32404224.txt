MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director
FROM: Director, Center for Study of Intelligence

SUBJECT: The Agency's JFK Assassination Records |

1. The basic collection of the Agency's JFK assassination
records (approximately 320,000 pages). consists of. Lee Harvey
Oswald's 201 file and other documents which were sequestered by
the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) at the conclu-
sion of. its investigation. Certain additional records, including
400 excerpts from the minutes of the DCI morning meeting and some
DO working files, have been added to the collection since the
passage of the JFK Assassination Records Act in 1992. To date, we
have reviewed and released to the National Archives, either in
full or redacted form, approximately 200,000 pages. The remaining
records are in various stages of review (third agency ‘and :
Congressional material) or are pending discussions (microfilm
material) with the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB).. (C)

2. Currently, we are conducting a second review of Oswald

201 documents in coordination with the ARRB. These are the docu-
ments that were released earlier in sanitized form. We expect
this effort to result in a significant increase in the material
being released in full. The ARRB has access to the full text of
all sanitized and denied documents. The Board has been briefed by
Agency officials on the need to protect certain categories of
information. To date the ARRB has accepted the need to protect
. the identity of sources and agents, and liaison relationships.

However, the issues of identifying CIA overseas locations and

releasing the names of retired staff employees are still under

discussion. (C)

3. Two major items still pending discussion with the
ARRB are some 35,000 pages within the microfilp part of the
collection which are not related to the JFK assassination
story and over 10,000 pages of staff employees' personnel
files. (C)

Description of The Collection

4. The Oswald file has served as a repository for JFK
assassination related material over the years. Only 39
documents were in the file at the time of the assassination.

SUBJECT: The Agency's JFK Assassination Records

The bulk of the approximately 26,000 pages consists of
documents collected immediately after the assassination and
during the Warren Commission investigation. Included are a
large number of third Agency documents, particularly from the
FBI. Other major additions to the 201 file include relevant
Mexico City Station files and materials generated ‘by various
FOIA requests and investigations such as that of New Orleans
District Attorney, James Garrison. (C) .

 
     

5. The HSCA sequestered records consist of | -""

163,000 pages) of microfilm. The hardcopy material includes
the copies of most of the CIA documents in the Oswald 201 and
copies of records and files provided in response to HSCA
requests. The latter includes 201, personnel, and security
files on individuals who are mentioned in documents relevant
to the JFK story or who figure in one of the numerous
conspiracy theories. The collection also includes about | :
30,000 pages of documents, memos, and notes (many aan
handwritten) created by the staff of the HSCA during the
investigation. (C) ‘ :

6. The 72 reels appear to contain all files that the HSCA
staff requested or to which they were given access. The bulk of
the material consists of files on individuals and organizations
including 26 reels of 201 files, the equivalent of five reels of
staff personnel files, and over 12 reels on anti-Castro exile
organizations. The rest of the records range from extensive
files on operations in Mexico City to the debriefing of Soviet
and Cuban defectors. Approximately half of the microfilm is
duplicative of the hardcopy material in the basic collection,
including a complete set (12 reels) of the Oswald 201 file. All
but a small percentage of the materials are CIA-originated
cables, dispatches, memoranda, reports, and correspondence. (C)

7. Under the JFK Records Act, an agency may appeal to
the President if it disagrees with the Board's decision to
release what the agency regards as sensitive information.

The President then has 30 days in which to inform the Board
as to whether he is granting the appeal or not. Thus far, we
have not found it necessary to a l any of the Board's
determinations. (C) :
