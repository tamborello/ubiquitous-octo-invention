A Norfolk confidential informant, on August 14, 1959, reported

having received a call from a friend requesting assistance in obtaining
a house in the Norfolk area for the family of Caleb Diggs, subject's
prother. Caleb Diggs has been in the Veterans Hospital at Fayetteville,
North Carolina, recuperating from injuries received in an automobile
accident in December, 1958. At the time of the accident, Caleb Diggs
had brought his family to his parents' home at Hamlet, North Carolina,
from their former residence at Nyack, New York. Caleb Diggs resided at
subject's home during the same period when the murder of subject's
family, for which subject is wanted, took place. The Norfolk informant
who is making contact with Caleb Diggs will endeavor to determine if
Caleb Diggs is in possession of any information concerning the whereabouts
of subject. ,

FREDERICK craneLoonn

Reports have been received from informants who are in contact
with associates of Dunn that Dunn is hiding out on a farm or fishing
camp operated by an Indian possibly in Minnesota or Wisconsin. Steps
are, therefore, being taken to circularize game wardens and licensed
guides to determine the identity of Indians who may be operating farms

or fishing camps.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police contacted the Legal Attache
at Ottawa on August 14, 1959, and reported that one Anthony Farrelie,
who has furnished reliable information to them in the past and who is
confined in the Saskatchewan Penitentiary, reported to them that a fellow
prisoner, Don O'Malley, requested that when he, Farrelie, is released
from prison, he contact an individual in Detroit, Michigan, for the
purpose of passing a message to Dunn. Farrelie was scheduled to be
released from the Saskatchewan Penitentiary on July 29, 1959. O'Malley,
who was a fellow inmate with Dunn when both were confined at the Ohio
State Penitentiary, desired that a contact in Detroit warn Dunn that ~
authorities believe he is in Canada, O'Malley admitted to the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police source that he knows where Dunn is, but never
would divulge the information. Hfforts are being made to arrange for a
meeting between the Royal Canadian Mounted Police source and the Detroit
contact for Bunn.
