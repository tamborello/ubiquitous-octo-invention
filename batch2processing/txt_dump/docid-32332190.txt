- LOUIS MARTINEZ arrested New York City PD charged
with kidnaping SIDNEY NEUBAUER, attorney for. PETER LEBLOVIC,
who is alleged to have contracted to sell arms and medicines
for use by Cuban Rebels. On non-delivery of arms and medicines,
LEBLOVIC delayed repayment of $34,000 to FRANCISCO VARONA
ALONSO and former University of Havanna students and sent
NEUBAUER to a pre-arranged meeting in New York City where
NEUBAUER was kidnaped and held from 10/16 to 10/18/58. MARTINEZ
deniedtaking part in deal concerning arms and medicines or in
kidnaping of NEUBAUER, MARTINEZ denied being in Cleveland or

Canton, Ohio since shortly after Labor Day, 1958.

Investigation at Canton and Cleveland of associates,
relatives and airlines to date fails to show LOUIS MARTINEZ -

in Canton or Cleveland since early September, 1958. Investi-
gation at Cleveland Airport fails. to show MARTINEZ passenger

on flights to Miami and San Juan on 10/13 or 10/16/58.

MARTINEZ denied ever being engaged in the purchase or trans-

‘portation of arms, ammunition or planes for Cuban Rebels.

If MARTINEZ is re-interviewed at New York, it is
noted in Cleveland Airtel of 10/20/53 informant advised of
contacting him through RUTHFORD, thereby indicating more of
an association than.indicated by MARTINEZ on interview.

; It is further noted in Cleveland Airtel of
1920/58, informant states MARTINEZ during July and August,
1958, negotiated for ten planes in Toronto, Canada, which
planes were shown to informant by MARTINEZ. New York inter-
view reflects MARTINEZ denies purchase of planes for Cuban

Rebels and refused to give reason for visit to Toronto.
