LA 92-1112

It Was agreed for source to contact Dr. JOSEPH
DESIMONE; brother of deceased La Cosa Nostra "Boss" FRANK
DESIMONE,and relate to him the details of source's previous
contacts with JOSEPH CIVELLO of Dallas concerning the
Teamsters Pension Fund Loan for the purpose of purchasing
the Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas and the involvement of. NICK
CIVELLA of Kansas City. Source would attempt to induce
DESIMONE to go to Dallas to determine from JOE CIVELLO why
CIVELLO was no longer interested.

ae

Source did contact Dr. DESIMONE on the same day

and requested DESIMONE to come to source's office, which he

did. Source explained the situation and DESIMONE said that
i JOE CIVELLO's cousin is in Los Angeles and he talks to him
oe all the time. Dr. DESIMONE said he will immediately go to
Dallas to contact JOE CIVELLO to find out why CIVELLO has :
taken this non~interested position in helping source obtain .
the loan.

a Because source had previously told Dr. DESIMONE
that he would receive his brother FRANK's share, DESIMONE

is acting in his own interest to assure that there isa {

share to receive. ~

Source will advise the results of DESIMONE's
meeting with CIVELLO.
