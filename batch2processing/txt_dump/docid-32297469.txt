APPENDIX
DETAILS OF PROPOSED INSTALLATION

Pursuant to Bureau authority, dated February 12,
1964, a survey was conducted to determine the feasibility of
effecting misur coverage on subject's private office at
the Ken Iron and Steel Company, 2263 Third Ave., New

Kensington, Pa.’ .

The Ken Iron and Steel Company is located in the
twelve hundred block of Third Avenue and fronts on this
avenue, while the rear of the enclosed yard bounds on ;
Spruce Alley, running éast-west between Second and Third f
Avenues and terminating at the east end of this yard.
Residences on both Second and Third Avenues are telephonically
serviced through a.lead-sheathed aerial cable traversing the

on utility pole #19319 immediately behind the yard. From

this utility pole the cable is dropped into the company's :
office's cellar where it terminates in a twenty-five "protector-
paired" box, five pairs of which service the office's various
individual télephone numbers, The cation of this office

is approximately 16 wire-miles from pe [Pittsburgh office
Consolidated Plant \(&\

CS PG 187-S advised that a cable-record check
disclosed several line pairs which could be made available
for use. One pair was selected (Pair 847) and on testing it,
measured 2,055 ohms with a db loss of 8.7 over the approximate
16 wire-miles.

Subjects$ private office is located in the rear
northwest section of the first floor and has approximately
10! by 11! dimensions. The-walls are pine-panel plank while
the 10' ceiling is constructed of acoustical tile. The

furring strips, 24" on horizontal center. The private office
is serviced with a five-key telephone instrument which inter-
connects, in addition, with several offices and points in
the junk yard. This keying unit obviously replaced a former
number of privaterline instruments. On the north wall is
mounted a 44a block. ;

 

It is proposed that one mike be installed in the
northwest corner of subjects! private office on the west

wall at a height of 34" and a point 22" from the northwest

corner. Ingress to this. area can be made by removing one

section of plank, two at’ the most. The preamp leads will be

extended behind the plank, downward and will emerge on .
the top interior west wall of the cellar and will thereafter

be secreted to the cable outlet. '

It is anticipated that the installation personnel
will enter the Ken Iron and Steel Company surreptitiously.
Prior to entry, all logical principals will be placed
under surveillance and will be surveilled during the entire
operation. Special Agent personnel who are acquainted with
the subjects and key associates will be placed in strategic
positions to provide utmost security throughout -the entire
operation to insure advance warning of any approach by the afore-
mentioned persons. It is realized that trespass will occur
‘put every precaution will be taken to ‘prevent any possibility
of compromise.
