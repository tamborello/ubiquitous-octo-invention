‘THE WARREN ‘REPORT |
~discussed draft agreement being negotiated between ‘the Secret” ‘Service
"and the FBI, A question had been raised by Mr. Robert Carswell,
Chairman of the President's Committee on the Warren Report, as to
why there was nothing in the draft agreement to the effect that the
FBI, in order not to jeopardize sensitive subversive investigations,
did not disseminate to the Secret Service the names of a select
group of highly sensitive cases, The Bureau did not want anything
in the agreement relative to exceptions which were within’ the
responsibilities of the FBI nor any secret agreement indicating
there was exception to the agreement, Carswell's query related
to a group of 16 individuals identified through penetration, of
Soviet—bloc telligence on whom we e workingfooking toward,
doubling them secuting them, onffur ther penetrating:: bloc CARY |

The memorandum pointed out that,while it was not thou eht

| desirable from a security standpoint for the names to go over
INN | Secret Service, it was still less desirable to have any fuzzineps
28 ‘in the agreement with Secret Service which could: be utilized a
%N  |some future date to indicate the Bureau did not meet its . fs
2 iresponsibilities, The proposed action was that, if the Director,

| agreed, we would furnish the names to Secret Service under thej-
_lappropriate classification,

Two of these cases involve Yugoslav a: ts whose identitie

gents who were identified by{our Czech defector-i-place { iiMglC E
who is now being operated by Central Intelligence Agency#(CIA) in
echoslovakial gies are agents of the Soviet Committee for State
Security (KGB)“idehtified through FEDORA, a Soviet defector-—in- :
place; Four are agents of Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU)
identified through TOPHAT, another Soviet defector-in-place;. One
_is a Castro-Cuban intelligence agent who repregents an important
penetration of Cubangclandestine communications: a) :

In no instances have the original sources indicated that
any of these espionage agents have ever had an assignment or training
in assassination or terrorist activity. These people are collectors
and transmitters af information; . :

Memorandum Mr; W.| As Branigan to Mr)! W.' C. Sullivan - 4
11/12/64 (memorandum attached) recommended that these cases be
removed from the Espionage Special Section of the Security Index,
that the Liaison Section retrieve from Secret Service all documents
concerning the Bureau regarding these cases, that the appropriate
31a offices be informed that this has been done with the caveat,
: that should any of these subjects become involved in a plot a
gainst the President o gr OF other reasons disassociated with our
: defectors-in-place, warrant reinstatement on the Security Index,
the field should again recommend such subject for inclusion on
Security Index and prepare appropriate material for dissemination
to Secret Service: :

   
 

 

The Director noted, “Just what would be my explanation ;
if one of these 16 should attempt to kill the President and we !
had not furnished background to Secret Service?" : \

. « ., in response to the Director's inquiry, memorandum 1.
Mr Wi, Ay Branigan to Mri W,' C.' Sullivan dated 11/16/64 (memorandun

j attached) pointed out that, bearing in mind that these 16 individuals
have not.threatened the President .and. are not the type to engage
in such activity, we would be in the same position as we are in !
with reference to thousands of other individuals on whom we have
investigative coverage or information. who are not on the Security
Index and whose statements and activities do not bring them within
the criteria for dissemination to Secret Service, The Director i
noted, "I concur most reluctantly.” - . .
