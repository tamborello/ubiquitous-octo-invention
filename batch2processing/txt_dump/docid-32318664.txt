ASSASSINATION. THIS MAY BE A TOPIC OF INFORMATION SURFACED BY
SUBJECT IF AND WHEN CONTACTED BY THE FBI, I.E. THAT "MARTIN"

HANDLED OR HAD DIRECT ACCESS QO THE CUBAN INTELLIGENCE

 
   
    
 

INVESTIGATION OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE

ASSASSINATION OF KENNEDY. THIS. PIC WOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY
ITEM FOR AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE IN A\POST-CASTRO CUBA AND CUBAN
INTELLIGENCE AND "MARTIN" PROBABLY ANTICIPATE THIS. CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY THAT CUBAN INTELLIGENCE AND/OR "MARTIN" MAY
WANT TO HEAD OFF ANY SUSPICION OF CUBAN COMPLICITY IN THE
KENNEDY ASSASSINATION BY PLANTING INFORMATION NOW. SUBJECT
WOULD IN EFFECT PLAY THE ROLE OF THE SOVIET KGB GENERAL WHO
TOLD THE WORLD THAT THE KGB HAD NO INTEREST IN OSWALD WHEN HE

‘

WAS RESIDING IN THE SOVIET uNION, |; .
IF TIME PERMITS, MIAMI WOULD RECOMMEND THAT SUBJECT’S
VISA BE PROTESTED ON BASIS OF INFORMATION REPORTED IN

MIAMI WILL CLOSE ITS CASE ON SUBJECT AND on COPIE

OF PERTINENT SERIALS VIA AIRTEL TO PHADELEEZA |
