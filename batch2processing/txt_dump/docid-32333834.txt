re

The LHM is classified "confidential" in order. to
protect the identity of informants of continuing value,
‘the disclosure of whose identity could have a detrimental

effect on national security interests.

Local dissemination is being made to INS, MI-Det.,
OST, NISO, U. S. Coast Guard, and U. S. Customs, San Juan,
q Puerto Rico.

no This matter will be followed closely in the
\ San Juan Division and pertinent détails promptly reported..

 

ADMINISTRATIVE

so that the ship could be registered in the State of
| Florida. FONT said that he was very busy and that it would
| be around December, 1966, before he would arrive in San

\ . Juan, Puerto Rico. pl
