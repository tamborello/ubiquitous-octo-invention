Beechcraft Travelaire Airplane, Registration NG6795T,
left Florida, filed a flight plan for Beliz British
Honduras, and were never heard fron again. fen October 2,
1963, a private search mission of nine persons in a
DC-3 aircraft flew to Central America te look for RORKE.
On October 6, 1963, the party returned, without success.
CHARLES COLLIER of Dallas, Texas, paid for the mission,
