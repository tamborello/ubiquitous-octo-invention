cover on ail mail received by KRONFELD at Cye the

- Shirtmaker and had determined that KRONFELD was still

in receipt of packages of shirts being mailed throughout the
country by known gamblers to KRONFELD. PALMER stated
that his sources indicate that theshirts received by Cye
the Shirtmaker from known gamblers, are encoded by the
use of thread drawn though various positions on the
shirts. The PO Department has attempted to break this
code with negative results. PALMER stated that although
he can account for many packages received by this

He also stated that Cye is utilized to transfer money from
one place to another, andthat when a gambler wishes to
transfer money, he placed'an order for a shirt with Cye
and leaves the money there, which Cye either delivers or
ships when he ships the order for shirts.

It is noted that in April'and July, 1964,
NY 4008-C-TE, advised that Cye the Shirtmaker, 37 West |
‘57th St., was utilized a§ an establishment for the receipt ~
of skimmed funds from Las\Vegas.

USA MORGENTHAU has indicated that he will not
proceed with any arrest of \the Reed-Courtney Syndicate
until the FBI has ample opportunity to conduct a close and
intensive investigation of the operation of Cye the Shirtmaker.
He explained that COURTNEY is presently in the Riviera
in France and he expects COURTNEY knows he would be
arrested if he returned to NYC. USA MORGENTHAU indicated
that the FBi would be in a better position than the
other agencies to develop information concerning the
activities at this establishment. At the present time,
the NYO has established a PCI in the building of 37
West 57th St. and is currently using this PCI to develop
a highly confidential source. All interested offices
will be advised of the results of this investigation.
