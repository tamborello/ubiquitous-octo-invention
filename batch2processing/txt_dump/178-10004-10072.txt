something. - There were more nutty ideas. It reminded me of
the time o£ oss ‘when. ‘somebody wanted to get propaganda into
Germany and they discovered there was a herd of cows “that

grazed in Germany and were milked in France, so they devised

some suppositories into which there were put a lot of

theory they were being left on the German side of the border _

A I don't believe I was familiar with it at the time
I although I can! t say. I certainly heard about the gun business

later because I had Occasion to go back when President Johnson

 

asked. me about. this. episode at one time to look into ‘the records
to find out about Trujillo. tr could find no evidence that the
Agency had been responsibie for his demise but f did find
evidence at the time that there was an opposition group in the
United States Government was anxious to have the Agency support
and assist and I think I may very well have known about the
opposition group at the time. -. =

I’ have no recollection any longer that I was privy to the
sending of any guns fo: to. the Dominican Republic and if TI was,
I don't recall they were ever identified as being designed-to

kill Mr. Trujillo. I know there Was a desire on the part of

whatever Administration was in power then, they didn't like we. |

concerning the possible assassination of Patrice Lumumba?
A I don't recall anything about any plans to assassinate

‘Patrice Lumumba. I know that Lumumba was a controversial figure

atlthe time. I know whatever year this was -~ was in the

Eisenhower or the Kennedy .era that Lumumba was riding high. —

_ @ I believe that the era would have been in the era of
1959, '60. I believe he was killed in early '61.

A... L-xemember later hearing all kinds of allegations
about. Lumumba and how he had been killed and why he had been
killed. I remember also the fact that the -- it was abundantly

clear that the Agency had had nothing to do with his demise

but whether there was a plot on the Agency at sometime or

another to.try to bring about his demise I was not familiar with

 

it. I want to sav here I will obviously do the very best f

can with my recollection but when you consider how: much has need

in the newspapers about a number of things in the last period o
years it is pretty hard to stick in time when you first heard
about something. Com ook.

“All I-am trying to convey here is I was not as far as I

by assassination. ” - oe
Q Now, the dictator of the Dominican Republic, Mr.
Trujillo, was killed on or about May 30, '61. Prior to that

time were you'aware of the fact that there had been a request
