“OCCURRENCE:

On August 29, 1963, the following report was listed within the Saigon Station's chronology
of August 1963 coup activities as follows:

 

 

"At 0745 hours, RICHARDSON, SPERA and CONEIN, latter two of whom were scheduled to contact
GENERALS MINH and KHIEM at 0815 same morning, were shown a message from GENERAL TAYLOR to
GENERAL HARKINS stating aspects of Vietnam situation being reviewed at WHITE HOUSE and com-
menting that second thoughts were beginning in Washington. Faced with this information and
o« Sliven strictly limited time factors, RICHARDSON decided that the meeting, with GENERALS MINH

and KHIEM should not be postponed but that ‘contacting officers would make this meeting a
fact-finding mission without encouraging or discouraging GENERAL MINH.

we proceeded to TRUEHEART's office to make our report. The AMBASSADOR came in and RICHARDSON
advised him of our meeting with GENERAL WEEDE, of TAYLOR's cable, and of the decisions which
RICHARDSON had made as a result of the ‘TAYLOR cable. LODGE was anepry and expressed the view
that RICHARDSON's decision had destroyed the possibilities of carrying, out a coup. RICHARDSON
expressed a firm dissenting opinion." (12)

OCCURRENCE: On or about October 5, 1963 when the telegram of October 5 and 6 were sent

to Saigon, MC CONE was called over by PRESIDENT KENNEDY and met privately with PRESIDENT

@ KENNEDY and the Attorney General, ROBERT F. KENNEDY, and took the position that the CIA

“should take a hands off position as far as the assassination of DIEM was concerned. MC CONE

w' felt that the President agreed with my position, despite the fact that he had great reser-

§ vations concemming DIEM and his conduct. I urged him to try to bring all the pressure we

® could on DIEM to change his ways, to encourage more support throughout the country. My pre-

“cise words to the President, and I remember them very clearly, was that Mr. President, if I

_ was manager of a baseball team, I had one pitcher, I'd keep him in the box whether he was a
good pitcher or not. By that I was saying that, if DIEM was removed we. would have not one
coup, but we would have a succession of coups and political disorder in Vietnam, and it might.

fe} OCCURRENC!: In a Presidential meeting on Vietnam with the CIA participants ;

dbeing MeCone and Colby the record by Colby reflects that McNamarra pointed out that
cLodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon. Mr. McCone commented
hat he believed that we should move cautiusly, that we should talk seriously to Diem
gand that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic
‘view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach
ebe made toNhutto seek his cooperation ina departure. The President asked whether we
had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid. (as proposed in a paper prepared
by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President
asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent
to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some
real contact with wen Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the

   

instance Involving CIA payment to Col Tung last week.
