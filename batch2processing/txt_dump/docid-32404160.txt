Re: Lesar v. CIA, No. 92-2215 CRR
Dear Ms. Moreau:

This letter advises you that the Director of Central
Intelligence has determined, as a matter of policy, to direct the
’ Agency to search the minutes of DCI Morning Meetings for
information responsive to the Freedom of Information Act request
underlying the referenced litigation.

Pursuant to our conversation with James Lesar, the search
will be limited to the minutes for meetings occurring on or
between the dates 22 November 1963 and 31 December 1979.
Responsive portions of the minutes, if any, may constitute
‘assassination records" under the the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (ARCA), Pub. L. No.
102-526, 106 Stat. 3443 (October 27, 1992). Therefore,
responsive portions probably will be transferred to the Agency's
Historical Review Group (HRG) for processing under the standards
of the ARCA. The HRG, already fully engaged processing the
records at issue in the Allen v. DOD and AARC v. CIA cases,
probably will not be able to address this information until late
summer or early fall 1993. Under the ARCA, the Agency has until
22 August 1993 to complete its review of identified assassination
records. The HRG is making its best possible effort to meet that
deadline.

 

In light of the Director's decision, I see our options for
responding to this litigation as:

(1) moving to dismiss the case for failure to exhaust
administrative remedies--no administrative appeal. If
successful, this would remove plaintiff's argument that he
is entitled to some expedited treatment under the ARCA.

(2) moving for an Open America stay on a first-in,
first-out basis. There are a number of FOIA requests that
predate the one at issue in this case. For instance, the
Allen request predates this one and, therefore, should be
processed first, even if the litigation is settled.

(3) attempting to settle with Mr. Lesar by agreeing to
provide him with free copies of whatever responsive portions
of the minutes are located and released under the ARCA. In

exchange for this agreement, Mr. Lesar must dismiss the
litigation with prejudice.

Each option has its own merits.
