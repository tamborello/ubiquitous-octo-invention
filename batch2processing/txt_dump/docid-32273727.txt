Dear Bert:

With reference to your letter of June 25 requesting our assistance in
the effort to provide for Church Committee access to documents in the
Presidential Library, I did, after speaking with you, speak also to Dr.
Reed. Dr. Reed confirms that he has been in touch with Mr. Wilderotter,
Associate Counsel to the President, and that appropriate arrangements
have been made. If we can be of assistance, we of course would be glad

to do so.

Yours very truly,

~~,
sf
aye
Richard H. Lansdale
Associate General Counsel
