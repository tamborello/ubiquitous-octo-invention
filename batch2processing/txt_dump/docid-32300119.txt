TEETER advised that in the event it was ever
necessary to surveil any of the MC GUIRE Sisters, care
should be taken, inasmuch as all three of the sisters can
read lips at any distance they can see, He said
this ability to read lips has been developed over a number
of years and he considers all three of the girls to be
experts, TEETER stated he was not attempting to obtain
any information relative to any possible surveillance
but was merely furnishing information since he desired to
cooperate with the Bureau, No indication was given to
TEETER that surveillance had been placed on PHYLISS MC GUIRE
concerning the Green Gables Ranch. \\

. TEETER stated that PHYLISS believed she was under
surveillance by the FBI at all times and that obviously the
thought had been inspired by subject a.

In this regard, it is noted that PCI Leer
(Protect Identity) advised SA WILLIAM R, SWOPE on 6/26/61 -
that JOE PIGNATELLO thought that he was under constant surveil-
lance and had made the remark that he changed automobiles
three or four times a day to evade surveillance, It is noted
no fisure has been maintained on PIGNATELLO in order that
there be no possibility of interferring with the present
investigation on subject. \y .

A fisure of PHYLISS MC GUIRE on the night of
6/16/61 reflected she left. the Desert Inn Hotel in a 1961
Cadillac Convertigle, Nevada license C 63414. She drove
to the Green Gables Ranch whighetsnidagatedeon Pecos Road
approximately 4 fille south of Flamingo Road in Paradise
Valley near Las Vegas, It is noted that the Green Gables
Ranch is in a fairly isolated desert area and that a fisure
on the vicinity except from a fixed observation point is not
practical, The @reen Gables Ranch is presently under a
five year lease to a Mrs, GAY ROBERT, 413 Las Vegas Boulevard
South, Discreet inquiry in Las Vegas reflects Mrs, ROBERTS
operates the Personality Center (Massage Center) and that. she
would probably not be too responsible in her actions. Further
discreet inquiry reflected that Mr. and Mrs, SETH ANTHONY
reside on the ranch and occupy the position as caretakers .\W_

Contact was made on 6/17/61 with Mr. and Mrs,
SETH ANTHONY away from the ranch, It was determined that
SETH ANTHONY is a First Lieutenant in the United States
Air Force and is presently stationed at Nellis Air Force
Base near Las Vegas, The ANTHONYs described the ranch as
