Re: Walter Harv

LINK has been the subject of previous
correspondence between us, most recently in _
connection with his association with the prominent -
‘U.S. gambler Gilbert Lee BECKLEY. LINK is, of
course, a prominent racket figure in this country A
and is presently operating out_of Vancouver, B.C. al
LINK's most recent venture is t ilton Carpet —
Contractors Ltd., a high pressure ¥ sales fit
Operating in the home improvement rackets area.

The Hilton firm is known to be presently active

in British Columbia and Alberta. During enquiries
into the Hilton operation we have noted the presence
of at least two former Chicago criminals, Leslie
PLANTING, FBI #987869, and Morris KERNESS, Both

of these individuals have also been the subject

of correspondence between us.

260 The Saturday Evening Post of November 9,
1963, carried an article entitled "Crime in America,
Part IV". On page 26 in a paragraph headed "They
Can't Understand", mention is made of a Felix

_ ALDERISIO and his involvement with the sacking of

a Chicago firm, Hilton Carpets. In view of the
similarity of the name of the latter firm and
LINK's outfit, coupled with the presence of Chicago

criminals in Canada, the thought occurs that there
may possibly be a connection

pte

Be - We would very much appreciate any infor-
} mation the Bureau might belable to obtain regarding

Hilton Carpets in Chi 0.,/including incorporation
tails, officials; end any other persons, particularly
from the criminal element, who may be involved.
