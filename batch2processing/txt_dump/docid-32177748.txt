RSs Source advised HOFFA was not stupid and would not have
. made a request for a contract "hit" in the manner described by
-RAGANO, Source advised HOFFA never. trusted "shyster" attorneys
-and certainly would not have trusted an attorney to pass on a
request to kill the President of the United States. Source
believed that if HOFFA.wanted to order a contract "hit" on
‘anyone, HOFFA would have distanced himself from the "hit".
Source believed HOFFA would have made the request of a very close
trusted associate who then would pass the request on through many
yee ‘other layers of trusted associates without mentioning the origin
of-the request or HOFFA's name. : .

on : Source described HOFFA as. being "very paranoid" about
‘being, under constant FBI physical and technical surveillance. .-

If HOFFA attended a meeting where illegal activities were :
discussed and notes were taken by HOFFA, he (HOFFA) would tear up
the notes and flush them down the toilet before leaving the
meeting. Source noted HOFFA took this action because he feared
being. stopped and searched by the FBI as he departed meetings.

Source recalled HOFFA frequently had his telephones and
offices swept for wire taps by an LCN associate (name not.
recalled). This associate was later the victim of an LCN "hit" in
Chicago. Source advised HOFFA was so paranoid that at one time

_ HOFFA feared the FBI had "bugged" his toilet.

Source never had any discussions with HOFFA about
killing either President JOHN F. KENNEDY or Attorney General
ROBERT F. KENNEDY. Source did recall disparaging remarks made by
HOFFA about the KENNEDY family while both PRESIDENT KENNEDY and
ROBERT F. KENNEDY were alive. Source advised that while HOFFA
"disliked" JOHN F. KENNEDY, HOFFA did not "hate" him. Source said
HOFFA "hated" ROBERT F. KENNEDY. HOFFA's hatred for ROBERT F.
KENNEDY resulted from problems ROBERT F. KENNEDY caused HOFFA
while KENNEDY was assigned to the Senate Rackets Committee and
after KENNEDY became U.S. Attorney General. On several

.., occasions, HOFFA made statements hoping that someone would either
' "beat up" or "blow away" ROBERT F. KENNEDY. After PRESIDENT
' KENNEDY's assassination; HOFFA told source "JACK (KENNEDY) was
‘ ~ not a bad guy but he allowed BOBBY (KENNEDY) to run his life".

Source recalled that immediately following PRESIDENT
KENNEDY's assassination on November 22, 1963, the TEAMSTERS
offices in Washington, D.C., were closed and the American flag
was ordered to fly at half-staff by order of HAROLD GIBBONS,
HOFFA'S Executive Assistant in Washington. Because of this
action, HOFFA fired GIBBONS and replaced GIBBONS with ROY
FITZSIMMONS. s .

> source identified’ Jose CONNO (phonetic) as a current
TEAMSTERS official in New York city. Source described CONNO as
one of HOFFA's close assistants in the 1960s who may have
knowledge of HOFFA's activities prior to the assassination of
PRESIDENT KENNEDY.

Based upon source's relationships with past LCN bosses,
source commented that. if RAGANO's claims about an LCN contract
against PRESIDENT KENNEDY were true, RAGANO would have been
killed by the LCN years ago. Based on RAGANO's claims that HOFFA,
through RAGANO, requested TRAFFICANTE to arrange for the murder
of PRESIDENT KENNEDY, RAGANO should have been killed shortly
after PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S assassination. This would have been
done to prevent RAGANO from identifying either HOFFA or
TRAFFICANTE as orchestrating the "hit".

yan msetiga lon (FBI), Washington Metropolitan Field Office} on
1/16-17/92: ; :

Source learned Tampa, Florida, attorney FRANK RAGANO
(phonetic) would be appearing on the ABC News show "PRIME TIME
LIVE" on 1/16/92 claiming to have information that former
TEAMSTERS President JIMMY HOFFA instructed La Cosa Nostra (LCN)
bosses to kill President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963. Based upon
source's past relationship with both HOFFA and RAGANO, source
categorized RAGANO's claims as "lies",

Source advised source's relationship with HOFFA began
in the'late 1950s while HOFFA was a Vice President of the
TEAMSTERS. Source's relationship with HOFFA lasted until HOFFA's
disappearance. Source_described the relationship between source
and HOFFA as "close" {noting that source was one of HOFFA's few
associates who could meet with or call HOFFA at any time without
an appointment. Source stated HOFFA offered source a position as
one of H A'S trusted assistants which source respectfully
decl inedf( )

In regard to RAGANO, [source recalled attending only
three or four meetings with HOFFA da others in the early 1960s
which were also attended by RAGAN Although source has not had
contact with RAGANO for many years, source recalled RAGANO (like
most people attempting to contact HOFFA) was required to make an
appointment to see HOFFA in the early 1960s. Source was not aware
if RAGANO'S status with HOFFA changed in later years

Source identified attorneys close to HOFFA as EDDIE
SHAFITZ (phonetic), a partner of the late EDWARD BENNETT WILLIAMS
in Washington, D.C. and an attorney (name not recat) who was a
close associate of the BUFFALINO LCN family. ce did not
consider RAGANO an attorney "close" to norea (ip) &)

Source advised HOFFA was very close to LCN boss SANTOS
TRAFFICANTE and other LCN members. Source said HOFFA was capable
of ordering a contract "hit". Source advised HOFFA was always
"doing favors" for high level LCN members and, if HOFFA requested
a contract "hit", the "hit" probably would have been done by the
LCN for free.
