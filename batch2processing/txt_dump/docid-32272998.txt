Iv. Rosselli/VArona? Mafia plots

A. Report by James O'Connell dated 26 Dec. 1968. Rose@li called JIm and
stated he "ran into the'principal contact' of our project.""I asked if he
meant Tony, and he replied in the affirmative (Tony Varona). He had not

seen him in several years until this chance meeting at the Fontainbleu

Hotel. They had lunch together and during the luncheon, Tony indicated that
there were several "strong men" from the Caribbean area in Miami that were
determined to overthpow some of the current regimes in their respective
countries." Nicaragua | in particualr, was ma§ntioned. "Varona stated that

he along with other ldaders felt very bitter toward the Agency, and any
effort initiated by them would be done without requesting any assistance

from us. The basic complaint was that there were too many leaks in the °
security of the Agency." Varona reported that he keeps aware of what's
happening in cuba through the brother of a high Cuban official who is

supposed to be #5 in the Castro regime. The brother is living in Madrid.

agd gave approval. Colonel J.C. King was also briefed. Certain TSD and Commun-
ications people participated but were not witting of misiion. 0O'connell

was Roselli's contact until May of 1962. During week of Sept 25 Mahew was
introduced to Sam and Joe at the Fontainbleu. Joe gave the pills to Orta,

but Orta got cold féet. "Joe than indicated that Dr. Anthony Varona, one

of the principalbfficers in the Cuban exile junta, had beomae disaffected with
the apparent ineffectual progress of the Junta and was willing to handle

the mission through his own TESOUTCES «! " He asked as a prerequisite to the
deal,=that he be given $10,000 bead we for organizational
expenses and $1,000 worth of communication equipment. Dr. Varona's potential
was never fully exploited, as the project was cancelled shortly after the Bay
of Pigs episode. Varona was advised that the offer was withargim, and the pills
were retrieved."
