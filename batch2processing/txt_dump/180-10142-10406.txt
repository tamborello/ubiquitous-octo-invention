Despite what is now known about Lopez, the Warren
Commission may well have wanted to lay to rest
suspicions which. would remain about Lopez, and satisfy
itself that these circumstances in no way indicate foreign
involvement in the assassination. The CIA has contributed
to those suspicions by not airing the matter and explaining
circumstances which could shed light on otherwise sinister
appearing events. .

The Committee has documented instances where the CIA
decided to forego passing information to the Warren Commission
out of a desire to not lay bare extremely sensitive sources
and methods of intelligence. thefureiae poration
certainly falls within that category and as soon as the CIA
began receiving information ena(uieree jas the source of
the information about Lopez's travel, the cables and
messages reflected the desire to not reveal that method.

It also seems plausible that the FBI likewise chose not to

divulge what it had learned about Lopez because in doing

so, it would have had to reveal the sensitive CIA operation
which generated the initial information on Lopez's travel to Cuba

on November 27.

Lopez may well be the case, that fact does not explain either

the failure of the CIA to take more seriously the suspicions

 

of the sources, or most importantly, to report whatever
information it had to the Warren Commission. In that
regard, the attempts of the Inspector General to denigrate
the value of the information provided on Lopez do not

diminish the apparent negligence of the Ayancy in seriously

 

pursuing the information as it was received. The Agency is

 

not to be faulted for the strength of its intelligence
gathering, but rather for the 4udgment which kept that
intelligence from the governmental body, the Warren
Commission, which was mandated to pass on the strength of
exactly that kind of information.

From the information collected by the FBI, there
appear to be well~explained reasons both for Lopez's
desire to return to Cuba and his solicitation of the help of

local FPCC chapter for that travel. His contacts in Florida

 

appear on their face to be innocent and nonpolitical and not
in any way connected with. the assassination. Despite the
suggestion by the Senate report of suspicion in the fact
that Oswald "may" have been in touch with that same FPCC
‘chapter, no evidence appears to suggest that Oswald was
actually in touch with the Tampa FPCC, or that Lopez was

connected in any way with Oswald or Dallas.

by the fact that sources had reported within a few days of
Lopez's departure for Havana and of the assassination that the

circumstances surrounding his travel seemed “suspicious" and .

 

that in March, 1964, while the Warren Commission was well
underway into its work into the investigation of the
assassination, Lopez had reportedly been involved in the
Kennedy assassination.

In the 1977 report of the Inspector General of the

CIA, the Agency attempted to refute several "inaccuracies"

 

in the Senate report regarding the reporting on Lopez's
travel. That is apparently the only follow-up by the
Agency on the lead after the Senate report appeared.

In the first place, the Inspector General's report
corrected the statement in the Senate report that sources
reported that Lopez appeared "Suspicious" when he was

‘surveilled in Mexico. 65/ The TG report explained that the
internal CIA document of December 5, 1963 which characterized

the man as suspicious was merely "cryptic and impressionistic

 

rather than constituting a tangible basis for dramatic
activity or final conclusions." 66/

The report stated additionally that the March 19,
1964 cable from enelroneertey base |shich recounted the
information on Lopez ‘from the contact of the Mexican police

and claimed Lopez was involved in the assassination was

incorrect on several points: Lopez's name was misspelled
"Lopes"; it stated that Lopez entered Mexico on foot when

the CIA repeated the FBI's conclusion that he had traveled

by auto; it.gave incorrect digits in Lopez's passport

number; it stated that the Mexican tourist visa was issued

in Nuevo Laredo and not Tampa; and it reported that he

stayed at the Cuban Embassy. 67/ Based on these inaccuracies,
the Inspector General concluded that "the source patently

‘was extensively misinformed.' 68/ Based on that observation,
“the Inspector General completely discounted the cable
by the Deputy Chief of Station in Mexico City on March 20,
1964 that the Mexican police source information "“jibed"
with what had earlier been reported by the CIA's source. 69/
Presumably the discrepancies pointed out by the
Inspector General are meant to explain the fect that the
CIA did not take more aggressive investigative steps to
ascertain whether there might have been some connection
between Lopez and the assassination. In that regard, the
1977 Inspector General report explains that the Agency
had no other means of investigating Lopez at his disposal
and had carried the lead as far as it was able by

questioning a Cuban defector about Lopez. While the fact

Lopez's wife told the FBI that Lopez began suffering from
recurrent attacks of epilepsy and had to be confined at Jackson
State Hospital in..Key-West in early 1963. 36/ She stated that
he was treated by doctors from Coral Gables and Key West for the
epilepsy. 37/ She stated that she did not believe he had a
history of epilepsy before coming to the United States. 38/

She believed his convulsions were brought on by nervous tension
and worry over his family in Cuba and may have been a reason
for his return to Cuba in 1963. 39/

The wife said that in approximately November, 1963,
she received a letter from Lopez saying he had returned to
Cuba. 40/ The wife stated that she was surprised he had returned
but that he had mentioned he was going back to Cuba when he
left for Tampa in November, 1963. 4l1/ The wife gave her opinion
that he returned because of his close relationship with his
parents. 42/ The wife stated that she received another letter
from him later from Cuba. 43/ According to the letter, he was
working as an elevator operator in Havana. 44/ In that letter
Lopez said he had received some kind of financial assistance
for the trip from an organization in Tampa. 45/ According to the
wife, Lopez did not have sufficient personal funds to pay the

expenses to Mexico and Cuba. 46/ She said that he had never had

_contact with Cuban refugee organizations to her knowledge. 47/

which had been carried out in Key West, Florida. The report
stated that Lopez's counsin, ‘Guillermo Serpa Rodriguez, told the
FBI that Lopez came to the United Stated for the first time some
time after Castro first came to power. 27/ He stayed approximately
one year and then returned to Cuba. 28/ Rodriguez stated that
Lopez returned to Cuba because he was homesick and missed
his family; he had parents and four brothers who still resided
in Cuba. 29/

Rodriguez stated also that Lopez's brother Selito was
a member of the Cuban militia at that time. 30/ Another
brother, Raimundo Policarpo Lopez, had reportedly been
sent to the Soviet Union to study by the Cuban government,
according to Rodriguez. 31/

Rodriguez told the FBI that Lopez returned to the United
States in 1960 or 1961 because he was afraid he would be dravted
into the Cuban militia if he remained in Cuba. 32/

. The FBI learned that Lopez married an American woman in Key
West in August, 1962. 33/ According to Lopez's wife, he worked
for a time with ‘the Pepsi Cola Co. in 1962 and at the Molina
and Murgia Bakery in Key West, which was owned by cousins.’ 34/
She said that he also worked for a construction company in

Tampa in June, 1963. 35/

Rodriguez told the FBI that Lopez left Key West

in late 1963 to go to Tampa with the hope of being able

 

to return to Cuba. 48/ Rodriguez said he believed Lopez wanted
to return to Cuba because he was afraid of being drafted into
the U.S. military. 49/ Rodriguez said Lopez was not involved
in any pro-Castro activity while living in Key West, but that
Lopez was “definitely” pro-Castro. 50/ Rodriguez recounted that

\

in one instance he and Lopez actually had a fist-fight over

 

Lopez's pro-Castro sympathies. S5l/
In a report in March 1963, the FBI reported that Lopez
had attended a meeting of the Tampa Fair Play for Cuba Committee
' on November 20, 1978. 52/ The report also stated that ata
meeting of the group on November 17, 1963, Lopez stated that he
had been refused travel back to Cuba. “He said at that time
that he was waiting for a. phone call fron Cuba to get wore on

his departure to Cuba. 53/

According to that report in March, 1964, a member of the >

 

 

Tampa FPCC stated that she called a friend in Cuba on December 8,
1963 and was told that Lopez had arrived safely. 54/ The member
had attempted to. locate Lopez in Cuba through friends there because
Lopez had not delivered gifts to persons in Cuba from people

in Florida as he had promised to do. 55/° The member stated

also that the Tampa chapter of the FPCC had given Lopez

approximately $190 for the return trip to Cuba. 56/ The member

 

said that Lopez had gone to Cuba by way of Mexico because he did

not have a passport. 57/

The March 1964 FBI report listed Lopez's passport as
#310162, which had been issued in January, 1960, and his
Mexican tourist card as "M8-24553, issued November 20, 1963
in Tampa. 58/ It stated that Lopez entered Mexico by private
auto at Nuevo Laredo on November 23, 1963 and departed for
Havana on November 27 as the only passenger on a Cubana flight,
carrying a Cuban courtesy visa. 59/

According to the FBI file, Lopez's mother, Esperanza
Rodriguez, was born in Key West, Florida. 60/ The file
listed three cousins and four uncles who resided and worked in
the Key West area with their families. 61/

Lopez's FBI file contains a memo from the Tampa office
dated October 26; 1964 which states:

It is felt that information developed
regarding the subject is not sufficient
to merit consideration for the Security
Index. 62/

The only information transmitted by the FBI to the Warren
Commission on Lopez concerned a check at the Passport Office. 63/
The information the Bureau did send to the Commission about the
Tampa chapter of the FPCC did not include any information on
“Lopez's activities. 64/ The CIA apparently did not provide
any information on Lopez to the Warren Commission. As pointed:

out in the Senate report, this omission is made more egregious
