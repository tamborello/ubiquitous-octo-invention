MEMORANDUM FOR: WH/IH/ Panama os,

SUBJECT: . Pe HIDALGO, Balmee

 

eet

After several conversations with Mr. Hall of the Department,
of Justice, the U. S. Attorney: has decided to proceed without calling’ :
on HIDALGO, even for preliminary interview. Consequently, no
further action is required unless we hear further from Justice, .
Mr. Hall did gay, however, that they might well have to reconsider:
and may want to call on us again. I said we would make HIDALGO “= oe
available to their representative at any time in(Panama {put if the oS
request involved bringing HIDALGO to the United States we would
have to reconsider the whole matter at that time. Mr. Hall said
this was quite satisfactory and thanked wu us s for our cooperation. 7
