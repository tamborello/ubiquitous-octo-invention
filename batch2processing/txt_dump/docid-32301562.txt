Previous information has indicated that the
captioned anti-Castro se is ceggage Og carry
out @ bombing raid over from Bimini in Bahama
Islands. The airplane scheduled to be used in the raid,
an Aero Commander, Number N2624B, was located at the
Broward International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

On December 21, 1963, our source in the matter
who has furnished reliable information in the past learned
that one of the motors of the above-mentioned plane had
burned out and that plane were being made to obtain
another plane.

On December 22, 1963, Orlando Bosch Avila,
head of the captioned organization, stated that he
wanted the bombing raid to take place on Christmas day
as the vigilande of the opposition would be at a
minimum at that time.

Charles Bush, owner of the above-mentioned
Aero Commander airplane, stated on December 22, 1963,
that he would substitute a twoemotor Piper Aztec airplane
for the Aero Commander.
