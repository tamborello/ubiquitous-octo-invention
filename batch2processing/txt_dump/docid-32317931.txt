4 For information, during the early morning hours >

| of January 17, 1977, former SE 2434-PC attempted to commit
suicide by taking a combination of drugs and alcohol. Accord-
! ing to the physician in charge of the emergency room where

! the source was taken, there is a 90 percent chance that the
are! source will die and if he does not die, it is probable that

he will have brain damage and will exist as a vegetable.

The suicide note left by the source indicated that he was in
fear of his nieces and nephews being harmed by the information
that he had and thus he felt it would be better to do himself
in than to have his relatives harmed. The existence of a
suicide note is not common knowledge at this point.

 

 

The above is for information purposes inasmuch as
extensive news media inquiries are being received due to the
notariety of the source.
