September 29, 1977

Mr. James L. Wolf

Select Committee on Assassinations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Mr. Wolf:

: As indicated in my letter of 21 September, additional Army records
in the case of Loran A. Hall have been located through the Veterans
Administration Headquarters in California. A certified copy of these
records is appended hereto as Attachment 1.

The documents provided do not constitute a complete service record,
since these were destroyed by the 1973 fire at the National Personnel
Records Center. However, the file contains substantial medical records
and substantiates military service by Mr. Hall as follows:
