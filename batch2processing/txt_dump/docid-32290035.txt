fhe Swiss Central Police Buréau furnished the
following information received from the Cantonal Police in
Chur, Graubiinden, Switzerland:

it has been established that ALEX stayed at the
Schloss Hotel in Pontresina between December 22, 1962, and
January 3: 1963, together with his girlfriend, presumably
SUZANNE FUEGER, born December 3, 1938. Note of Arrival No.
24508 shows that they were accommodated in room 217 and 218.

Due to a misunderstanding by the Secretary of the
- local Tourist Office, the Note of Arrival was classified
under the name of GOS. This was partly the reason why ALEX
‘could not be traced during the investigations carried out
between Christmas 1962 and New Years. On the other hand,
this failure was apparently also due to the fact that the
exact whereabouts of ALEX were not known and that St. Moritz
and other winter Sport centers in the neighborhood are usually
overcrowded at that time of the year.

It has also been established that ALEX arrived in
Poentresina on December 22, 1962, by car, possibly a "Volks-
wagen 1506," registration number LU (lacerne) 29044.

; During: his. Stay in Pontresina ALEX had private }
Skiing lessons by ‘two lecal ski instructors and, according |
te the staff of the Schless Hotel, he did not mix with other ‘
guests ‘at the hotel... Hie girlfriend was addressed as Mrs.

ALEX, She spoke English with an accent, as well as a

Bavarian or Austrian dialect... Members of the hotel staff

described her as 25-30 years of age, about 175 cm tall,

mediun build, blonde. hair, and attractive appearance. .

‘The following trunk calis to foreign countries were
made by ALEZ during | ‘his ‘etay at the hotel: .
