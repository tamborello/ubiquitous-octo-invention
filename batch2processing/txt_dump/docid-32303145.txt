allowed his ticket to be sold at their numbers outlets n and
near New. Kensington, Pa. HYMIE MARTIN, with won| became
friendly when was a used car salesman in P sburgh, Pa.,

approximately 1954. MARTIN, who now resides in Miami, Florida,
probably turned over the distributorship of. the Empire Treasury
lottery ticket to his brother, NATE MARTIN, who is still in-
the Pittsburgh area. :

Recently, "the outfit" has come out with the Pan American
Sweepstakes ticket, which is based on the running of the Dixie

Handicap horse race at Pimlico Track, Maryland, in the’ near i
future... "The outfit" compelled KELLY MANNARINO to take 10,000

books of these sweepstakes tickets, which he must dispose .

of in his area of Western Pennsylvania. One of KELLY MANNARINO's
employees, known as "SHRIGGS-," undoubtedly will handle the’ ~-

delivery of the sweepstakes tickets, as he currently does with

the Empire Treasury lottery tickets.

and they even send "luggers" to the Squirrel Hill section of

Pittsburgh, which means that gamblers in Squirrel Hill are ~
transported from that. section to New: Kensington for the pur-
pose of gambling. Routine employees at the gambling casino
receive $150 per week flat, and those in charge receive the
$150 weekly salary plus a-small percentage of the net take.
It has been curious. in the past .to note that whenever they so
desire; KELLY MANNARINO or SAM MANNARINO would walk into the

“gambling casino and demand that the cashier give them a sum

of money. For instance; SAM MANNARINO might tell the cashier.

“to give him $1,000 and not to’ tell KELLY MANNARINO at the

risk of being killed .Employees at the casino do not carry
weapons. generally, butm. occasions, when there is a rumor that
the. casino may be robbed, everybody, including the MANNARINOs,

Prostitution and Narcotics

Neither KELLY. nor SAM MANNARINO has ever been known to traffic

‘in narcotics or to operate prostitution. |

Hideouts

During the long period of time, in excess of. one year, that
KELLY MANNARINO was hiding to avoid service of subpoenas,
commencing in December of 1957, he. stayed at two places: .
the house of "SARGE" BOTTI, in Wilmerding, Pa., and the house
of FRANK D, "SONNY" AMATO, the brother-in-law of KELLY
MANNARINO, who :-residas..::. in East McKeesport, Pa.

During the period in 1958 when SAM MANNARINO was avoiding

. service of subpoena, he stayed, at least part of the time,

at the. parish house of Mount Saint Peters Roman Catholic.

F. POLICE PROTECTION AND POLITICAL TIES

New Kensington, Pa., Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK and the majority
of his City Council have been "owned" by the MANNARINOs, since
their election approximately eight years ago. At one time,

at the instructions of KELLY’ MANNARINO, "wired"
the New Kensington City Council chambers, so that tape . _OTHER 4

Gun-running

Although the Federal Government was not able to prove it,
there is no question that SAMUEL’ MANNARINO was part of the
conspiracy in 1958 to run guns from New Kensington, Pa., to
Cuba.

Originally-the plans to take guns to Cuba were
plans and the guns were scheduled to go to FIDEL CASTRO. In
the summer of 1958, AL Ross Ld that he could obtain
M-1 rifles and carbines. ROSS at the Warwick Hotel,
New York City, and OSS $4,000 as part payment for the
uns, which money had received from CARLOS PRIO..

fetvas to return tothe Warwick Hotel with additional
money in a day or so and did so, but AL ROSS did not show up.
After L____] returned to Miami, Florida, [___]learned from
Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO, Miami Springs, Florida, that SAM MANNARINO
was interested in purchasing an Apache airplane. Because

is a pilot and acquainted with airplanes, he looked
over the prospective plane with Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO and
advised Dr. NO that the airplane was too defective,
After that, [of assistes Dr. PESSOLANO to lease a Twin
Beech airplane from a company owned_by HAL DUPONT, Miami,
Florida. When Dr. PESSOLANO told | that MANNARINO intended
to use the airplane to fly guns to Cuban dictator BATISTA, he
realized that these were the guns that had been promised to
him and that he was being double-crossed. — then abranged
with Dr. PESSOLANO for[[___] to accompany the pilot, STUART
SUTOR, on the first flight to Pittsburgh, for the sole purpose
of contacting SAM MANNARINO and asking him about the double-
cross, After SUTOR and[__] landed at Allegeny Airport,
Pittsburgh, they took a cab to[_______] sister's house ‘in the
Regent Square section of Pittsburgh and borrowed her car.
They drove to the Tour-Tel Motel on U. S. Route 22, Monroeville,

where they registered for the night and SUTOR then
traveled to New Kensington, where attempted to locate
SAM MANNARINO. [ Twas unable to locate SAM MANNARINO, so

he went to Wilmerding, Pa., to the house of "Sarge" BOTTI,
where KELLY MANNARINO was hiding from the service of subpoenas.
KELLY MANNARINO stated that he knew nothing of the plan to
smuggle guns to Cuba, that this was one of SAM :MANNARINO's
"hare-brained" schemes, and that he wanted nothing to do with
it. — then returned to Miami, Florida, by way of Eastern
Airlines, It was not until the pilot, STUART SUTOR, was

NORMAN ROTHMAN

NORMAN:-ROTHMAN has represented the MANNARINOs in their Cuban
and some Florida interests for many years, ROTHMAN, like all
other MANNARINO employees, steals from them, and when the
MANNARINOs have lost money in an investment, such as the Sans
Souci Gambling Casino, Havana, Cuba, which ROTHMAN fronted for
them, ROTHMAN always emerges with money. ROTHMAN's Cuban
connections are over-rated and when anything actually difficult
is to be acco a, ROTHMAN ordinarily needs the
assistance of Currently, ROTHMAN has: the ' OTHER 4
franchise for ‘the cockta ar in the Bel Aire Hotel, Miami ¢
Beach, Florida, and his two Sons are working at the bar. ROTH-

MAN is, like SAM MANNARINO, an addict to cocaine, which he
sniffs.

of being a "tired old man," and he’ shows no enthusiasm for
taking part in any illegal activity to obtain money, even
though he is in serious financial straits.

JOHN. CHRISTOPHER FONTANA
EEE, BUNTANA

JOHN FONTANA was once KELLY MANNARINO's bodyguard and most
trusted lieutenant. KELLY MANNARINO regarded FONTANA as his
protege and made him a "don," After FONTANA's marriage about
a year and a half ago, he ana MANNARINO had a falling out.
FONTANA -thought that he was not getting enough money and
complained to MANNARINO, who told him that he was getting all
he was going to get. FONTANA then made the serious mistake
of going over KEILY MANNARINO's head and appealing to JOHN

LA ROCCA, who Subsequently reported this to KELLY -MANNARINO,
Since then FONTANA has been relegated to an unimportant. job
fronting the Marbet Heating Company store in New Kensington,

and he receives little or no income from the MANNARINO ganii ing
activities. :

No information has ever been received why the MANNARINO family
name was legally changed from RUGGIERO to MANNARINO.

GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO's wife, JEAN, had no choice in her
selection of mate. The marriage was arranged between her
father, FRANK AMATO, of Braddock, Pa., ard KELLY MANNARINO,.

JOSEPH PETER MANNARINO, aka, JOJO - Brother

JOJO MANNARINO, who suffers from a palsy-like twitching and
from severe stammering, is a "nut" and "con man." He has
dissipated the fortune of his wife, HAZEL, widow of motion
picture actor LEWIS STONE, in just a few years. KELLY and

SAM MANNARINO allow JOJO to come to New Kensington occasionally
on the conditbn that he "stays out of trouble," but JOJO always
does something to get into trouble, such as writing worthless
checks, and is forced to leave town. After such visits to

New Kensington, KELLY and/or SAM MANNARINO ordinarily make

good the amount of the worthless checks written by JOJO.
