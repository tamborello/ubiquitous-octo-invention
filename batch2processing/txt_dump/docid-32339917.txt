NY 134-7846

Informant said he is quite sure that since the
defection of YURI NOSENKO, Colonel BORIS S. IVANOV has
received explicit instructions from _GB headquarters in
Moscow regarding the tightening up of security in the
NY Residency, and has undoubtedly passed these instruc-
tions on to his deputies.

On 2/19/64, informant was talking to VLADIMIR
CHUCHUKIN concerning the above mentioned security precau~
tions which are now in effect in the KGB NY Residency.
' CHUCHUKIN told the informant it seems to him that all
the employees of the KGB NY Residency are somewhat
surprised at these new regulations. CHUCHUKIN said he
can well understand why these regulations are. put into
effect, namely, to maintain the best security possible
in the KGB NY Residency. He saic, however, that he
considers the new method of handling correspondence from
Moscow to be most unwieldy and he predicted that as
soon as tensions relax somewhat, the residency will be
' back to its former methods of operation. CHUCHUKIN ‘
said that if GABELKO. and the heads of the other branches
in the NY Residency vigorously pursue the policy of
in "snipping up" the film containing correspondence from

‘ Moscow, and handing it out to-the individual KGB employees,
they will soon lose track of the correspondence and will :
be in a worse administrative predicament than before they
started this new arrangement. -
