member to OSWALD during his specialist training period
at El Toro Marine Corps Base December 1958 ~ September 1959.
The Warren Commission Report takes note of this:

“OSWALD told DELGADO that he was in

touch with Cuban diplomatic officials in

this country, which DELGADO at first took

to be 'one of his lies, but later

believed. '"2

10. Actually DELGADO's testimony says a lot more of
possible operational significance than is reflected by the
language of the report, and its implications do not appear
to have been run down or developed by investigation. Thus,
the record of the beginning of OSWALD's relationship with
the .Cubans starts with a question mark.

ll. The period was one of transition in U.S. - Cuban
relations after CASTRO's takeover. OSWALD, and DELGADO at
the outset, were CASTRO supporters, OSWALD being particu-
larly keen about how to get to the island. DELGADO testi-

fied:

it in New Orleans - must be considered of

great significance in the light of the

pathological evolution of OSWALD's passive/

aggressive makeup after his attempt to kill

General WALKER early in April 1963 and his

identification with Fidel CASTRO and the

Cuban revolution which is directly trace-

able as far back as his Marine Corps

service in El Toro, California. CASTRO's

warning and threat, given to AP corres-

pondent HARKER, irrespective of whether

there was any formal mandate, or even

security service contact with OSWALD

by the Cubans or the Russians - was an act

of singular irresponsibility and under no

circumstances was excusable as retorsion

\

for what the Cuban emigres were doing during

the summer of 1963.

9. The testimony of Nelson DELGADO contains an assertion
of germinal significance to any review of the background of
Lee Harvey OSWALD's feeling toward and relations with

CASTRO's Cuba. DELGADO was probably the closest peer group

grow until there has been a full disclosure
by these governments of all elements, of
OSWALD's handling and stay in the Soviet Union
and his contacts in Mexico City. The

Warren Commission report should have left a
wider "window" for this contingency. That,
indeed, was the opinion at the working level,
particularly in the counterintelligence com-
ponent in the CIA in 1964. As was indicated
by Mr. Helms in his testimony before the
Warren Commission, CIA would continue to
regard this aspect of the OSWALD case as
still open.?

c. In the absence of additional or new
elements of "credible" evidence, there are
"nuances" in the record that emerge as note-
worthy, in the light of other conclusions.
These are reviewed and summarized below, item-
by-item.

a. CASTRO's warning and threat of

7 September 1963 - if OSWALD did indeed read

 

Investigation of the Assassination of President John F.
KENNEDY. Hearings Before the President's Commission on the

 

 

Assassination of President KENNEDY (Washington, ’ 1964),
hereafter cited as Hearings, Vol. V., pp. 120 - 129. See
especially p. 124 - "Mr’ Helms: 'Yes. I would assume

the case could never be closed.'"

The Evening Star of Washington, D. C., printed the HARKER

 

story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the
paper (9 September 1963, page B-4) and reworded the content
of the HARKER interview, placing the emphasis on the po-
litical aspects - in particular, highlighting the GOLDWATER
elements and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States
leadership in the middle of the piece.

7. There is no evidence in the files on the KENNEDY
assassination that this CASTRO interview was considered in
following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission
and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed
Headquarters attention to the AP story very shortly after
the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears
to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid-
eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba. There is no evidence
in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission
staff itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview
in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no
evidence in the files that anything along these lines was
stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at Mr. Belin's
request, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the
assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know
from testimony of Marina OSWALD and cthers - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results

of the review, admittedly heavily using the 20 - 20 quality
of hindsight, may be stipulated in summary:
a. There is no increment of credible
evidence, applying this phrase strictly, of
Soviet and/or Cuban political, intelligence
or security service involvement in the as-
sassination to what was developed and con-
sidered by the Warren Commission and its
staff. The Commission's finding that
Lee Harvey OSWALD was the killer of
President KENNEDY and Officer TIPPIT and did
them in alone and of his own determination
stands.
b. "Credible evidence" that would
upset or significantly modify this 4udgement
did (and does) not exist in Washington. But
such evidence could exist in Moscow and/or
Havana, whose voluntary inputs to the Warren
Commission were minimal in quantity and
quality, designed to cover up any admissions
of knowledge of, or connection with, OSWALD
‘ which might be related directly or indirectly
with the assassination. Therefore, the belief
that there was Soviet and/or Cuban (KGB and/or
DGI) connection with OSWALD will persist and

SUBJECT : Review of Selected Items in the
Lee Harvey OSWALD File Regarding Allega-
tions of CASTRO Cuban Involvement in the
John F, KENNEDY Assassination ~

REFERENCE ; Letter by David W. Belin to
Mr. E. Henry Knoche, 15 April 1975,
paragraph 3 (Regarding Public Statement
by CASTRO, etc.), attached

BACKGROUND

1. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,
Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in
Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal
interview by the Associated Press correspondent, .
Daniel HARKER.

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,
8 September, and was in print throughout the country on
Monday, 9 September. There can be no question from the
facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been
expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this
event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER covered a range of
topics but dealt principally with American political
leadership, in particular President KENNEDY, whom he ex~
coriated in extraordinarily provocative fashion

("... KENNEDY is a cretin;" " ... the BATISTA of his

times ... the most opportunistic American President of

all time ...").

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the
New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that
CASTRO's “message” was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided
until the middle of September 1963, the HARKER story
appeared in the principal morning paper, the Times-Picayune,
on Monday, 9 September, page 7, under a three-column head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) —- Prime Minister
Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.S.
leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba. '

"Bitterly denouncing what he called
recent U.S. prompted raids on Cuban terri-
tory, Castro said: 'We are prepared to
fight them and answer in kind. U.S. leaders”
should think that if they are aiding terror-
ist plans to eliminate Cuban leaders, they
themselves will not be safe.’

" .,.. World affairs ... seemed to be
entering a more peaceful climate a few days
ago, but now this trend has changed with
attacks.

"'The U.S. is always ready to negotiate
and make promises which later it will not honor.
This has happened to promises made during the
October crisis. They have been broken as can
be seen with new attacks.

"'But I warn this is leading to a very
dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

erisis than October's ...

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,

used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference
to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real

significance. The Washington Post did an abbreviated re-

 

write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.
