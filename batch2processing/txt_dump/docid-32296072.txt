MECHLING advised that the information furnished by ‘MC DOWELL
held. no particular significance for him until the evening

' of July :31, 1958, while in the. process. of conducting a
surveillance of GABRIEL MANNARINO's home on Charles Avenue,

| he observed a red and white 1956 Plymouth station wagon
bearing Pennsylvania license 958GY pull up in fronts :
of the MANNARINO home and observed the occupants entering f
the house.

 

| Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Bureau records indicate Pennsylvania

license 958 GY is registered to Anna Marie Domenick, 1014 —

Do Manor Road, New Kensington, Pa. -It is noted that the Manor
Road address is approximately: two.blocks from the MANNARINO

home on Charles Avenue in. New Kensington. : - '

WILLIE SAMS on September 13, 1958,. SAMS was complaining .
about a terrible hangover and mentioned that he got drunk
with GABRIEL MANNARINO during the evening of September 15

; _or the morning of September 16, 1958.. T-9 said that SAMS

also.told him that MANNARINO hasbeen back in New Kensington

' since early September and.is very unhappy about the lack of

' pusiness in the gambling casino and the general pressure being

{ brought to bear on New Kensington by Federal investigative

: agencies. T-9 said that SAMS did not. go into any further

; detail regarding his. drinking bout: with MANNARINO and T-9

: considered it inadvisable to press him at the risk of .

l appearing to: be,too inquisitive. T-9 pointed out that in
all probability, ‘SAMS and MANNARINO did their drinking on
September 15,or.16, 1958, at the. Laetus Club.on Fifth Avenue,
New. Kensington,. next door to the Triangle. Billiards gambling
casino. T-9 noted that. SAMS follows a strict. daily routine
which includes being at the Laetus:Club.to supervise. the. :
MANNARINO--sport. betting operation :usually.until. one or two
in the morning every day.except Sunday and he seriously: doubted :
whether MANNARINO would risk. drinking. at any other establishment
providing, of course, they did not.go to one of their homes.
T-9 assumed that MANNARINO probably, entered. the Laetus. Club
through the rear door on Bares Street and.spent the evening
with SAMS drinking inthe. Laetus. Club..since. the management
of that club would not betray MANNARINO nor would the local '
police. Lo, : ae wT :

however, whebher the MANNARINO brothers may have put up money

Lakeview Recreation Area,

Route 56, New Kensington, Pa.

7 T- 1h, who has furnished reliable information in the
past, ‘on September. 9, 1958, stated that. in conversation with
SAMUEL MANNARINO at the Ken Iron and Steel Compapy, on
September 3, 1958, MANNARINO authorized him to locate a group of
responsible New Kensington residents who might be interested
in forming. amprivate club to.take over: the.management of the
Lakeview Recreation. Area on.a long term lease.

According to T-14, MANNARINO is particularly
interested in having a group of approximately 100 people who .
would be willing to lease the recreation. area for $5,000 a.
year with MANNARINO retaining the concession rights to the
restaurant. T-14 explained that apparently MANNARINO does

.not feel that the state of his health is sweh that he can

bear up under the responsibilities of managing the establishment
and that by leasing the business. he could assure. himself of a
substantial financial return without being saddled with the
responsibilities of the business.

T-14 stated that he gathered from their convesation
that MANNARINO has cancelled the liquor license in the Lakeview
Recreation Area restaurant and has made arrangements with the
Liquor Control Board whereby the same license will be transferred
to a new location approximately 300 or 400 yards from the
Lakeview Recreation Area where MANNARINO is having the Murin
and Fiorina Construction Company build a new cocktail lounge.
