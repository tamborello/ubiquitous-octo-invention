MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group (Augmented) on
Operation Mongoose, Thursday, 5 April 1962

PRESENT: General Taylor, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, Mr. McCone
and General Parker

l. Mr. Johnson reported that the Italian representative at
the UN has now been briefed on the proposal to approach the Cubans
with an offen of food or medicine in exchange for the Playa Giron
prisoners. He noted that no specifics had been agreed on, and the
first contact would be for the purpose of establishing in principal
the possibility of such an exchange.

2. Mr. McCone reiterated that all reports of Cuban inter-
vention in the Hemisphere are proving to have no substance when they
are actually run down. In answer to General Taylor's question as to
what the U.S. might do if hard evidence of this kind is obtained,

Mr. Johnson pointed out that a subcommittee of the OAS, on security,
had been authorized at Punta del Este. This committee was given the
authority to mobilize multi-national action against the Castro regime
in the event that such hard information is obtained. It was agreed
that whatever information becomes available should be given to General
White, who is the U.S. representative on this subcommittee.

3. Mr. McCone said that after studying the possibility of
using Cuban air crews, CIA had concluded that they would not be
suitable for supply drops at night. On the other hand, trained U.S.
civilian crews could be provided by Civil Air Transport (CAT) in 30
days. Arrangements could be made to have these pilots ostensibly —
employed by Cuban exile groups in the U.S. and, therefore, they would
be non-attributable to the U.S. Government. He said that available
Cubans could then be used for less demanding missions such as leaflet
drops. There appeared to be a general feeling on the part of the

Group me! that U.S. civilians of this type would not be essentially Ilo
different]than "sheep dipped" personrielfjin the event that any were
shot d er Cuba. GUY)

4. Mr. McCone referred tothe Weekly Progress Reports which
are now being produced by CIA. He said these are required internally
within the Agency, and that to consolidate them with reporting from
other responsible departments and agencies would slow things up and

and make the report less useable. It was, therefore, agreed that

the CIA Progress Reports would continue to be produced every Tuesday,
and that a highlighted summary would be prepared weekly by General
Lansdale and forwarded to General Taylor's office for information of
the Group. It was also agreed that General Lansdale should normally
brief the Group every other week. : :

5. Mr. McCone expressed some impatience with progress being
made on the project, and speculated as to whether it might not be
desirable to consider the possibility of a different approach. In
this connection, he noted that reconnaissance has revealed con-
siderably less Cuban military strength than had been expected.
General Taylor &@sked that Mr. McCone give the Group, next Wednesday,
a summary of the intelligence received from reconnaissance and from
the debriefing of, exfiltrated agents.

6. The Group discussed at. length the question of whether
the U.S. would actually welcome an excuse for overt intervention.
One of the points raised in this connection was the possibility of
massive death sentences for the Playa Giron prisoners, and whether
this would serve as a casus belli. The possibility of a quick
operation to liberate the prisoners was also mentioned. It was felt
that the time has now come when the basic philosophy of the project
should be examined once more, with particular reference to the
possibility of finding a pretext for early overt intervention. A

meeting was set up for next Wednesday at 2:00 p.m., to include the
Secretaries of State and Defense. .
