; : On 4/16/65, GEORGE HOPKINS advised that a good look-

i ing woman about. 26-years old, 5'6" or 7" tall, slim build, and l
long bleached blond hair has been staying with ROSSELLI for the i

past several days and on 4/15/65 she and ROSSELLI moved a lot

of her clothes into ROSSELLE's apartment. HOPKINS will endeavor

to obtain the name of this woman,

On 4/13/65, LA 4145-c advised that he had learned
from FRANZ BREITLING, owner of Ajax West: Coast Corporation,
Santa Barbara, California, that ROSSELLI recently sold about
_26 Kold Draft ice cube machines to some establishment in-Las
Vegas, Nevada, and has potential orders for about 100 addi-
tional machines within the next.several months. ROSSELLI
sells ice cube machines and Ajax West Coast Corp. sends the
machines to the buyer, collects the money, and then sends .
ROSSELLI a check férrhis profit on the sale. In this connection,
recent examination of ROSSELLI's bank account at the Fidelity
Bank, Beverly Hills, California, revealed a deposit of a check
for $525.72 drawn on the Crecker-Anglo National Bank, Santa
Barbara, California. In the past ROSSELLI has received check
from the Ajax West Coast Corp. which were draw on this pank
-and this. check was probably a payment for ROSSELLI's profit
on the sale of ice gube machines.
