Someone would have to. be the ‘leader of this group swho
. commanded the respect and support of local Cubans. He
pointed out that ERNESTO" who had come to be known as _the
spokesman” for “Cuban Power, was respected by many and could,
perhaps. serve this purpose, ,

BOSCH indicated they would use various techniques
to. raise funds and stated that one "GUADO", an individual
‘yhom they apparently knew by this nicknane, contributed : sos
$5.00 per month to the organization as did many others,

_ BOSCH's associate, who appeared to be hearing much of this

. for the first time, raised the question of the legality

of these activities and asked BOSCH if it was not likely

' these activities were illegal and the participants night
“very well be arrested and sent to jail, BOSCH said he

“aia not care whether they were illegal or not, they were
still prepared ‘to carry them out for the Bood of Cuba.

He boasted that the authorities were afraid to arrest

hin, BOSCH, because they knew he would cause a great

7 deal of trouble and unfavorable publicity if arrested.

"personally been involved in any of the bombing ae - fee

“these activities, and Governnent authorities could _

manner as had FELIPE RIVERO, He would réfuse to - : rs
cooperate in any way and would refuse to eat. He would
_ live on bread and melado, which was a liquid form of
sugar. He pointed out that the bread would stand for _ 7 f
the. fact that they were Christians and the melado would.

stand for the fact that they were nationalists. BOSCH-

 

indicated that the publicity from this would be most

 

unfavorable for local authorities and for that reason
he ‘considered himself more or. less untouchable, -
BOSCH's associate had asked him what about
CARLOS RIVERO? BOSCH indicated that CARLOS RIVERO,
who | has been- the leader of the nationalist group in

New York City, has not joined with the Cuban Power

 

“movement and is apparently still in New York City.

7 In his account of this activity, although he used the term

 

"we", it was obvious that he was probably not among the
group who actually participated in this activity. BOSCH -
uh indicated that the next major planned activity of the

Cuban Power group was to go to the Olympics games in - aa ps

 

Mexcio City to make their cause known,
_-He said that in connection with these activities, 7
it was necessary to raise some $200,000.00 in order to be _ 4
able to continue the. bombings. He said that sone Cubans
mistakenly thought the CIA was involved in these activities
- and was, perhaps, helping to finance them but this was
“not the case. He said it was necessary to ‘raise the funds.
_ through contributions from the Cuban community. He
‘acknowledged he was’ aware of the fact that it would be.
"impossible to raise so much money under his name, ORLANDO
BOSCH, or under the name of his organization, the MIRR.
‘Because of past unfavorable “publicity and involvements
with the United States Government, many local Cubans would

not contribute to any program of which he was the acknowledged

leader; therefore, it was necessary to create a front or a

the recent ‘activities, the responsibility for which he
credited to Cuban Power, were. the following:

The recent bombing of the boat in San Juan,

  
 
 
  
   
 
   
 

Puerto Rico, harbor was an: activity of ‘Cuban Power, and
. ‘he was sure that the boat would have sunk if the Coast
Guard had not been alert and prevented it from doing so

‘by going to its assistance, i aa

 

The recent shelling of the Polish vessel, ‘the -

; "polaniea", in Miami had been a@ Cuban Power activity,
and BOSCH explained how they had prepared a.car for the ,
little cannon and driving out along the causeway to the

appropriate spot.. He indicated that they had had to get
