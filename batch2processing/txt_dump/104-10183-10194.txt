not discussed. A/1 was told that spedial equipment for a
rifle such as the FAL was difficult td procure as the
weapon was designed primarily as a general-purpose combat
for special tasks. A/1 then asked about the
possibility fF purchasing & special weapon in Europe and

will continue to be one of concern to all persons connected
with the AMLASH/1 operation until it is resolved. Perhaps
the best bet would be to level with AMLASH/E at the next
meeting and tell him that such equipment will not be forth~
coming from KUBARK or ODYOKE sources, together ‘with the

reasons why not.

d. CAcquisition of Cuban Pesos. A/1 stated that he had
called(Ricardo BORDO'S) Son in Philadelphia several times
(confirmed by telecons earlier between undersigned and A/1
in New York) but that in each case, the son had stated that
he had received no packages from bis father from Mexico
during the latter's last time in that city. A/1 thought
this indeed strange. The undersigned opined that perhaps
it was difficult to obtain pesos today due to the stringent
currency controls now in force in Cuba. We suggested to
AMWHIP/L that he not pursue this problem with oRDO/f£ ther,
as any over-zealous efforts on his part to obtain the”
currency migh} cor to the attention of the Cuban authorities.
Of course, if( BORDQ} does produce the pesos at a later date
(with no addi tional prompting from A/l), they will be readily
accepted. ot

ceived an answer to date, _It is not known at this time
