entered division is to be advised immediately.

though the addressee is in another field division

information((for District of Columbia, send FD-10 to the

Washington Field Office instead of the police department).)

Investigations in foreign countries

1 Agents have no jurisdiction in foreign countries, Within
limitations border office Agents may, through liaison with
cooperative foreign agencies in adjacent countries, arrange
for investigations to be conducted, This should be done in
a circumspect manner tc avoid any allegation of a violation
of the sovereignty of the foreign country, Where interviews
are conducted in a foreign country in the presence of and/or
at the request of a Bureau Agent, the Bureau Agent should \
insure that the person interviewed understands that the intervie
is being conducted by authority of the officer of the host
country and not the Agent, This should not preclude the Agent,
where proper, from discreetly assisting the foreign officer in
extracting all information of Bureau interest during the interview, ~
Bureau Agents have no jurisdiction in foreign countries, no
power of arrest, search, or seizure and must be most circumspect.
They are not to be present at the scene of an arrest by foreign
authorities, participate in or be present during searches
incidental to such arrests, accompany foreign officials trans-—
porting prisoners, or participate in interviews of prisoners
except at their place of incarceration and in the presence of
foreign authorities, The Agent should refrain from unauthorized
acts even though invited to do so by the foreign cooperating
officer,

(2) Where official business requires more than two days in a foreign
country, authority must be obtained from the Bureau. The letter
requesting it is sent UACB and must contain an estimate of the
time to be spent.
