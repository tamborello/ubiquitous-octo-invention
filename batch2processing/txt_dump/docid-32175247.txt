“ADMINISTRATIVE (Cont'd)

Leads are being set forth for offices covering
cities where bank accounts of persons contributing to the
organization are located, to check indices on the names of
these cbntributors. Previous subversive or criminal activity
on the part of these individuals would be of interest to this
investigation. No additional investigation on these individuals :
is requested at this time since the purpose of this investi-
gation is to determine if the organization, its sponsors or

officers have incurred the responsibility to register under
the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and it is not felt that
membership of these persons would have an effect in malcing
this determination.. -

. No further investigation is set forth for SID LENS,
ROBERT COLODNY or ELVA DE PUE MATTHEWS, since they are described
in the details or administrative pages of referenced report.
