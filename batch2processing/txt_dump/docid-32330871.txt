es re subjectS activities. 4
ADMINISTRATIVE:

As previously reported, subject is being contacted '
1 under the TECIP program and carried as symbol number '
: 1283-PC, .

The investigative period of this report overlaps \
that of the previous report due to the fact that informant

information and lead information was not available for submission
in re report. :

NO 1075-C advised he told PHCORA he thought the
$5,000 CIACCIO wanted for fixing his zoning problem was oy
too mu and that he thought he should mention this to ‘

s A arvtHoNy MoLOGRa father-in-law of CIACCIO. NO 1075-C said he u
ue told PECORA that they should help an old. friend a little.
Source said PECORA used a group of obscene phrases in \
referring contemptuously to BOLOGNA, and source thought .

this was unusual since BOLOGNA furnished PECORA with the |

money to buy the Tropical in the first place.
