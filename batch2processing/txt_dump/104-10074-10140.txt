source of OOA(S) 322/16870~75 and O0A(S) 322/17013-73. Alliegro is
independently wealthy as his father had been in a high governuent
position during the Batista regime in Cuba and apparently lett the
country with quite.a bit of woney. Alliegro does mot have a job
presently, but has told us is looking for work. He does own a
building or two in Miami afd apparently hss otheri:héldings that
provide his with a handsoie income. Alliegro said thet he had some
inforsation that we w . find interesting. When we set with Alliegro
oa the afternoon of 2 Novenber 1973 he said that he had been approached
by one Steve Van Cleave’ of Intelligence Services Ltd., which is based 24
an Atlanta, Georgia. Van Cleave had telephoned Alliggro end asked wa

wag to South America and had sonething important to discuss with

US corporations and private citizens had invested a great deal of ~~.
money in the suceesa of this Intelligence Service, Yan Cleave said -
that Intelligence Services Ltd., was an information agency that passed
detailed inforsation to US corporations that operate in South America,
Central Aserica, and soon the Caribbean area as well. Van Cleave

said that in Seuth America US corporations were sainly interested in |
labor «pvesents and that his service would infiltrate the Communist. _.
Labor groups and. report on their trends of thought and the directions |
they planned to take an issues. Alliegro suid that Van Cleave told

hia that hés. service already had a South Anerican and Central Auerican
branch and that it ia running extresely well.

Yan Cleave told Alliegro that he wanted to. ‘aeet with him because he .

would handle the Caribvean area. He said that his organization had... -
well educated people in their analytical end and some extremely =
talented operatives to handle their operations and cavert end of the
tusiness. Van Cleave hinted to Allieyro that in South Axerica sone

CIA people were moonlighting for his organisation. Van Cleave asked: ae
for Alliegro's aid in setting up the Miami office. He said that he 4

 

that he would staff the office with his own people. Alliegro said
that Van Cleave emphasized that US coyporations were very interested .
in the Caribbean area and for that reason he is setting up the branch.
