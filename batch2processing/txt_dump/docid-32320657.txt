Memorandum from John A. Hartingh to Mrs. Morris, dated 11/21/95
Re: JFK TASK FORCE

 

 

 

DETAILS: On or about 11/28/95, the ARRB will formally advise by
letter to the Director the determinations noted by them on FBI
documents at meetings 11/13 - 14/95. The ARRB made determinations
on 25 FBI documents. The JFKTF and the ARRB are in agreement with
the disposition of 18 of the documents, with one document pending
further review. However, the ARRB will order release of
information in six documents (copies attached with pertinent
information marked) identifying five individuals, described below,
two who were “Confidential Sources” of the FBI, one PCI, one PSI,
and one symbol number informant with singular information. The
information to be released is summarized as follows, by document

number:

1. HQ 62-109060-2981 (page 2), NAR 124-10058-10009,
identifies LA 3436 S as “the daughter of Charlotte Randall
McElfresh”. The JFKTF was willing to release the prefix and

’ suffix of the symbol number and the name of McElfresh to be in
compliance with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act (the
Act). The ARRB determined that the numeric portion of the symbol
number would be upheld, but that the singular identifying
information be released. In the Letterhead Memorandum, which has
been released in its entirety, McElfresh is interviewed and
identifies her daughter as Patricia Jane Welch. JUFKTF research
indicates that the daughter is currently living in the same area
with the same identity.

2. HQ 62-109060-3771, NAR 124-10026-10413, identifies
Brant Coopersmith as a confidential racial source. The ARRB
determined this document should be open in full. A review of his
HQ 137-8385 file indicated he was closed in 1965. JFKTF research
through the Butte Information Technology Center (BITC) did not
find any current records on this individual.

3. HO 62-109060-4526, NAR 124-10058-10086, identifies
PCI George Clark Johnston, who provided information on David
Lewis, a prior roommate. Mr. Lewis was making claims that he had
names of individuals involved in the Kennedy assassination. The
ARRB determined this document should be open in full. A review of
the Headquarters and New Orleans indices and the BITC data bases
did not indicate any records associated with PCI Johnston.

4. HQ 62-109060-4527, NAR 124-10058-10085, identifies
PCI George Clark Johnston who reported the same information set
out in number 3 above. The ARRB determined this document should
be open in full. ‘

y : 5. HQ 62-109060-4535, NAR 124-10058-1084, identifies
William S. Morris, described as a confidential source, as
