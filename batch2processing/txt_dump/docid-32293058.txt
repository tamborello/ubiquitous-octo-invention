on getting help for CARLOS MARCELLO to obtain a 6-month
delay at his INS deportation hearing scheduled for 6/27 or

close in the past, and he would be interested in helping

MARCELLO get this 6-month delay. The source said RUSSELL

LONG, U. S. Senator from Louisiana, would be interested in

assisting MARCELLO since in the past he, too, has received

financial aid from MARCELLO. The source said LONG had

recommended and was sponsoring a Louisiana official for the

top INS position in Washington, D. C., and if he could get

this official appointed, he then could help MARCELLO through

this appointment. The source indicated to PCI[-_ J that OTHER 4
the FBI was investigating this Louisiana candidate for the ,
INS position. The source said MARCELLO has in excess of i
30 million dollars in cash, and that he controls politics |
in Louisiana. - '

pct [—_] said CARLOS MARCELLO and his close-
contacts and friends will secure a complete run-down on
the commissioner who will preside at the INS hearing in
McAllen, Texas, and an approach will be made directly or
indirectly to him financially to delay the deportation in
accordance with MARCELLO's wishes. PCI[ | said he
knew of no further details concerning the methods to be
used by MARCELLO or his contacts, but that they would
concentrate on the weaknesses-of the commissioner obtained
from a result of their investigation of him. PCI
felt overtures in this direction would be made in the
immediate future.

delay because he and his lawyers feel they can whip his

deportation permanently if granted this period to.do it.

PCI[____| said he has no use whatsoever for OTHER 4
CARLOS MARCELLO and felt the U, S. should rid itself of ‘
such hoodlums, and that is why he wished to furnish this
information. He said that he told the source he would
not be a part to help MARCELLO because the deal would not
be a public relations matter which is his business but a
fix, and that his present reputable promotional venture
is a-successful one, and that he did not wish to hurt:
his reputation or the reputation of his present business
through the suggested implication.

An original FD-302 has_been prepared, initialed
and recorded in the file of PCL at Miami,
in the event it is necessary to have same at a later date.

Enclosed is a letterhead memo suitable for
dissemination to INS by the Bureau. Also enclosed is
one copy each for New Orleans and San Antonio for their
information.
