Also in July, 1961, HEMMING was contacting

training camp facilities, ani seeking *heir contributions
in dollar donations and weapons.

On August 24, 1961, HEMMING claimed he went to
Cuba and contacted representatives of the Cuban under=
ground. ANTONIO PEREZ QUESADA, Cuban exile beat captain,
on interview admitted he took HEMMING and six others to
Cuba on August 12, 1961 where they stayed about 42 hours.
However, neither HEMMING nor his mea made any contact
with the Cuban underground or militia.

La On March 30, 1962, as a result of press publicity,
. - HEMMING decided to diswaid other mercenaries and adventurers -

' from. coming to Miami to join his organization. HEMMING y
therefore sent out hundreds of form letters te persons

agents arrested HEMMING and his group, confiscated the
arms, and amsunition on the boat and charged them with
conspiracy to expsrt arms. On January 22, 1963, these
charges were dismissed. : .

  

In April, 1963, INTERPEN was down to. about six.
‘members; HEMMING found it difficult to collect money
donations, and cbtained smployment as a gardener.

 

In June, 1963, HEMMING and about four of his
men visited CARLOS ZARRAGA MARTINEZ, a Cuban exile who
maintained a large supply of arma at his residence.
HEMMING and his men pulled out guns, and threatened
ZARRAGA's life if he did not give them these arms.
ZARRAGA turned over these arms and HEMMING left the
house momentarily. While he was gone, U. S. Customs
agente arrived, Gonfiscated the arms, and arrested
HEMMING's men. .

 

In September, 1963, INTERPEN.no longer existed.
FFMMIVG's followers lost interest and felt HEMMING would
never bo able to launch any military action ayainst Cuba.
The majority of the recruits left Miami, others were
run out of town by the police, ani others were arrested
for burglary, larceny, and vagrancy. During this period, |
HEMMING visited leading Cuban exile political figures
and a number of american right-wing conservatives for
donations. He travelled to Dallas, Texas;. Chicago,
Illinois, and other places but was unable to false
