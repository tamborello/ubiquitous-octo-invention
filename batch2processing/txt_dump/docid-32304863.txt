PH 137-4887

Pii 872-PC has completed three years of college
and served time in the U. S. Navy during World War IT.

STEVEN JOSEPH LA TORRE, born 3/11/86, Montedoro,
Sicily, immigrated to the United States in 1903, and has
always vesided in the Pittston, Pa., area.

After arriving in the United States, LA TORRE
sent money to SANTO VOLPE, SR., (Deceased) Philadelphia
File 92-752, Bureau File §2-8318, to pay for VOLPE's
passage to the United States. VOLPE came to the United
States and became the leader of the Mafia in the Pittston,
Paes, area.

LA TORRE, who has admitted membership in the
Mafia to PH 872=PC, was a close associate of VOLPE in a
eoal contracting business for several years, LA TORRE was
also a business associate of CHARLES C. BUFALINO (Deceased),
Philadelphia File 92-1590, Bureau File 92-8630, who also
held a leadership role in the Organization. Both VOLPE and
BUFALINO were friends of LA TORRE in Montedoro, Sicily.

It is to be noted that CHARLES C. BUFALINO is the
uncle of RUSSELL A. BUFALINO, Philadelphia File 92-4,
Bureau File 92-2839, who attended the meeting of hoodlums
at Apalachin, N. Y., in November, 1957, and is the current
leader of the LCN in the upstate Pennsylvania area.

LA TORRE was an influential — in the

Organization from the time he came to Pittston, Pa., and up to
approximately 1945. Sometime around 1945 ill feeling developed

between LA TORRE and the Organization, and as a result he
was looked upon with disfavor and not recognized by the
leaders, including deceased JOHN SCIANDRA, father of ANGELO
SCIANDRA, who also attended the Apalachin meeting.

PH 872-PC has stated it is amazing that his father
was never killed by the Organization, but feels he has
been allowed to live because he has always been respected
and feared,

PH 872=PC has advised that in addition to admitting
membership in the Mafia, his father, STEVEN JOSEPH LA TORRE,
