DE LA MORA a iar more credible candidate ae the KGB agent, are
offered tor Hendquarters cunsideration;

Reterence: HMMW-1/142, 11 March 1969

1. Reterence asked tor any recent traces on Juan MIGUEL de
MORA Vaquerizo (201-239192), and whether he might be a personal
acquaintance of the former Mexican President, Adolio LOPEZ MATEOS,
in an effort to determine whether he might be the KGB agent, (anu)
MORA, descrived by AKDUNOR. .

: 2, A carerul review of the Station tile on Juan MIGUEL de
MORA Vaquerizo (please note that it has been determined that Suvject
uses "MIGUEL" as his patronym) has tailed to reveal any close connec-
tions with Mexican government personalities, or his appointment to
Mexican government delegations (per Paragraph 3 of Reference). While
Juan MIGUEL de MORA has been consistently proe-Leit, and anti-Mexican.
Government, and has had contact with Soviet Embassy officials in
Mexico City, there has been no indication that he has any good
high-level government connections (other than what might be routine
press access). There was one<meeting (rex orted in HMMA-13323,

17 July 1959) among MIGUEL de MORA, Ps TSKOV (201-120123} ,_ then
stationed with the Soviet Lmpassy “tn “Me ); and a TDY Soviet
(Mikhail Veaalyevich KREMNEV),.in June 1959 wnich could be ©
considered to have had some puzzling clandestine overtones; \there is
nothing else, however, to conrirm that Juan MIGUEL de MORA is the
KGB agent o1 the AEDUNOR report. Aa for@Juan MIGUEL de MORA's .

recent activities, reference is made to (@FPADBB99 15 January 1969;
HHMA~30427, 11 February 1969; and (OFPA=89015, 15 April 1968, which
