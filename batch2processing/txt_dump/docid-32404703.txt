as I heard.

Measures are taken and the relatives are put under control.
A. But why control them?
B. Well, perhaps a letter might go through.

A. Well, anyway ((it is said that)) the KGB has changed; they are so good

and likeable....
' B. Who told you that.

A. That is what they write.

B. "They write"....

A. They simply are so kind that they are kissing ‘the Soviet people's asses,

B. Oh, yes.

A, Well, if they are not so good, in your opinion, then....
((XG; A and B speak at the same time))
...What is holding you back from opening your heart and forgetting your
past?
They ((the KGB)) are entirely to blame, etc.;. why do you not make up
your mind to say, “Screw them", and begin from the very beginning and
tell the truth.

B. I am telling you only the truth; if there were some small....

((XG; A and B speak at the same time))

A. Well, I have been talking with you for 3 days, and I do not see any

confirmation of what you call the truth.
{Xdm telling you only the truth, absolutely.
((XG; A and B speak ‘at the same time))

Well, you are forgetting that we have just finished talking for the

last hour about the anketa, and you could not answer the simplest things.
I am telling you what I remember.

One cannot believe that you worked there; I to not know what keeps you

from talking sense, as they say.
Well, why do you say that?

((Pause)) Well, one more question -= what do you know about the

Personnel record sheet (lichnyy listok po uchetu kadrov).
What Personnel record sheet?

What is the Personnel record sheet?

What kind of document is it?
I do not know; I do not know the Personnel record sheet, I do not know.

Well, on every Party member and every Komsomol member working in the
organs of the MVD or in government work, or even a non-Party member
having some higher education or qualifications and on whom there is a
personnel file in the KGB or the Council of Ministers or the CC CPSU
and so forth... the CPSU Central Committee issues this Personnel record

sheet; it is some sort of anketa.
I do not know it.

it is completed by everyone.

 
I am doing time.
You tell me, "We do not believe you" ((but)) this is not a reason for
- aman to do time.

A. Do not look for the entire fault in yourself; I am not blaming only you..
B. No, I understand -~ that over there ((the KGB))....

A. Yes, "over there",...

B. ...Excuse me, they are crapping on me....

A. ...¥Yes, "over there", "over there".

B. I understand that, over there, they....

A. What -- "over there'?

B. Well... that they -- through the agent network and through trusted
persons, etc, -~ they are "giving it to'me.
I know how it is done, how a man can be turned into nothing, into
nothing!
I know this.
Whether you want it or not, there is something coming from over there;

I know about this very well.

A. We will talk about what is coming ((from over there)) and what is not
coming. :
Of course, you are interested in knowing what is coming; but I would

like to know what you think is going on there.

B. What do I think? |
What do I think?
I think, I know, that, of course, a decision already has been made
about me, and they have sentenced me to death; and some kind of case

has been opened against me, just as a case was opened against GOLITSYN,

Well, they did not say "nothing" ~- that is right; it would be rude....

. . a
It is right that I have exaggerted; absolutely right.
How many times has it been said, "Well, what kind ofa worker were you?
What kind?"
We still do not have the KGB here == we have not come to that yet.
Right, right; yes -—= you have not come to that but... somewhat...
something I did not expect from American intelligence or counterintelli~
gence.

What, for example?

Let us not talk about it -- this is a stage that already has been

passed; it is behind.
Well, I am interested in knowing.

You know everything very well.

You know every letter, every stage; you know everything

If I knew everything, then we would not have to be talking.

No, I say, what was, was; you know.

I do not know what you have in mind; I do not think that we did
anything unusual; I do not think there was anything out of the
ordinary; it was just everyday life.

That is not life; it was a sad existence.

Well, let us see, let us talk about it -- whose fault is it?

Well, how is it my fault?

Tell me why it is my fault; tell me why I am doing time, tell me why

Place yourself in the place of SHUBNYAKOV or FEDOTOV, having in mind
the position of ((some)) IVANOV as if it were yours == what would be

your decision?

I do not know; if I were in his place, then it would be another thing

(XG).

Because you told us at one time that you were a worthy counter-
intelligence officer.

But now you modestly say that you were such a simple, little....
In 1953, in 1954....
...A little case officer.

Now, why are you turning thihgs around?

That is not right.

In 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1956, I really was nothing; I was only a case
officer.

If you are talking about 1954, you are right.
Yes,

Right; what do you want me to tell you -- that in 1954 they valued me

and liked me and respected me?

Oh, do you remember, in the beginning, in the beginning, when you
had just established contact with us, how ((you said)) you had worked
against the journalists, against military attaches, and that you had

recruited dozens of Americans, and so forth,

Not at all, not at all; you do not have to.,. you do not have to paint

things that way....

((XG;" A and B speak at the same time) )

 
0 ' @
A. I can simply remind you of that which you said earlier; nothing more.
B. You do not have to paint things that way.
A. Anyway let us think about where the bones Lie hidden.

B. ((Long pause)) I do not know, I do not know.
What kind of bones?
Where?
I do not know.
((Long pause)) I do not know.
What kind of bones?
I do not know anything.
I never said that I was an ideal and outstanding worker.
I worked as I could and as I had to.
I never said that I had recruited dozens.
If I participated, I participated.

I have told how they treated me.

A. As if you were the best man, they sent you to Geneva... as the best

counterintelligence officer,

' B. How "as the best"?
In 1962, it was necessary for them to send not a senior case officer,

nor a case officer, but someone higher.

A. Well, that you were bigger does not fit ~- I do not see it.

You understand -~ if you somewhere somewhat....

B. ((Interrupts)) You know, this will not kill me, because I already have
heard this 482 ((times)) -- I have heard that I was not a good employee
that I am nothing.

I have heard this more than once; please continue in the same spirit.

A. I do not think that anyone told you that you are nothing.

TRANSLATION

((If)) you had it.
And when we come to your education we will add it to what I have said
((about parents, background, etc.)) -= your education in high school,

the Navy school, and the Institute of International Relations.

I do not know what you want to say.

I want to say that ((since)) you have found the ((in English)) excuse
of "taking into account my higher education,” we will return to this
question; I just want to remind you so that you will not forget.

I will put this all together....

(¢Please? or ? too bad?)

...in time....

Of course, of course.
I would like you to find something better....

I cannot find anything better, because I did not decide the question

about myself; I do not know how the question was decided....

I am asking you, from the point of view of a counterintelligence

officer, how do you (¥evaluate?) ((this))?

And I do not intend to resolve the question.of my life on ((to conforn

with)) one date.
