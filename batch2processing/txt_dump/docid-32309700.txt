1. Will further identify subscribers to tele-
phone numbers contained in subject's address book.

2. Recontact MM 1169-PC for further information
regarding subject's activity.

ADMINISTRATIVE

During the month of February, 1971, SA PETER C,
CLEMENTE, the case agent, was out the entire month on sick
leave and no investigation of the subject other than contact
of an informant was possible.

Delay in submission of a report in this matter was
due to SA CLEMENTE's illness, heavy involvement in police
school matters, Title III specials, and trials.

No further effort will be made to locate JOHN THANOS
whose check stamped insufficient funds was found in subject's
possession. Papers of subject indicate receipt of the check
during the operation of his vending machine business,

INFORMANTS

MM T-1 is JAMES HARRIS, Loan Officer and Vice Presi-
dent, Central Bank and Trust Company. -

MM T-2 is MM 1169-PC.
