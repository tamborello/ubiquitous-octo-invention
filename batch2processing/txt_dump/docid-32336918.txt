MULEY in care of ARTURO G. MATA, Poste Restante Central —
Lieges, Belgium. He stated that when he was about ready to
leave Madrid, Spain, he sent a telegram to the above mentioned
address, and addressed it to ARTURO G. MATA. He stated he
did not know recall the contents of this telegram, but that
he was certain that he did not state that he was leaving
Spain with instructions for MATA. On arriving in Brussels,
Belgium, GUTIERREZ attempted to locate both MATA and MULEY
through tne Cuban Embassy located in Brussels, but was un-
successful as no one there appeared to know either of these
individuals. He said he then sent MATA a second télegram
to the Same address in Lieges, Belgium, but received no
response. The Cuban Ambassador to Bélgium then personally
drove him to Lieges, Belgium, and the two of them managed 4
to locate MATA through inquiry in a bar in the Spanish ~ !
colony in Lieges. GUTIERREZ stated that after he met
MATA, the latter introduced.him to ADDERRAMAN MULEY, and
he admitted that the threeof them discussed Spain and its |
present problems, and that MATA and MULEY both informed :
‘ him that \they were actively engagéd in fighting against - {
wy’ ZERANCISS NCO. GUTIERREZ stated that both ADDERRAMAN i
45 MULEY andARTURO G. MATA were members of the Directorio © . |
Revolucionario Iberico de Liberecion (DRILL), and that he ‘
believed ADDERRAMAN MULEY was one of the directors of \

ARTURO G. MATA, and did not know if he had ever been in
Cuba, or whether he had ew with the present : |

to be a leader of the organization known as DRIL, and that
he reportedly was sent to Belgium for the purpose of organiz-
ing the Liege Branch of this organization, and that he had , |

- come to Belgium t find out as much as possible about DRIL
and its real value as a movement capable of overthrowing
the FRANCO government in Spain. SA T-2 further advised
that GUTIERREZ MENOYO arrived in Belgium by air from Madrid~
on July 21, 1960, and that since he had entered Belgiun
clandestinely, and since his presence was considered to- be
dangerous for the public welfare, GUTIERREZ MENOYO was {
