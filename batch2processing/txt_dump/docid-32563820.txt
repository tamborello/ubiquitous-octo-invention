SV. 13-93 -

: The facts in the instant case were presented telephonically
to Assistant United States Attorney JULIAN HARTRIDGE, who authorized the filing '

of.a complaint against both subjects for illegal wearing of the uniform. -

; On March 30, 194, complaints were filed before United
States Commissioner PERRY BRANNEN and warrants were issued against the subject

for violation of Section 1393, Title 10, United States Code, in that they
. wore uniforms of the United States Navy when they were not members of the

Navy and were therefore not entitled to,wear them.

On the same day hearing was held before Commissioner
BRANNEN at which time probable cause was found and subject HERMAN was
placed under $500 bond on charge of illegal wearing of the uniform and
WILLIAMS was placed under $1000 bond on charges of illegal wearing of

I, Jack Dale Williams, make the following voluntary statement.
to Tayl or J. Sims, III. who. has identified himself to me as a
Special Agent of the Federal Bureav of Investigation. No threats
or promises were made to me to give this statement, and I know
it may be used in court.

 

I was born July 5, 1925 at Key West, Florida, and I am now
18 years old. I have lived in Key West about all my life with
my parents Mr. and Mrs. Jack Dale Williams, that is until my
father died. ily mother has since remarried and her name now .
is Mrs. P. R. Engold, and Lived on Northwest E. Ste.

About two years ago I enlisted in the Merchamt Marine at
their office on Park Ave. in New York City. ‘Since,then T have
served on two boats, the SS. Malcolm and the Ss. Mills.
About the bth of March the J: S. Mills docke

   
 
 

Watertown, Tex. just outside of Galveston, and I wore this
uniform down from New York to Weshington. Herman bought his
uniform in Washington and I bought two service stripes and had
them put on my sleeves. TI have worn the uniform on the trip
down to Savannah and while I have been here since Sunday. I
know that I am not entitled to wear this Navy uniform. Last
night we lost out-caps at the USO where we have been staying.

5 We got plenty of rides by telling people we were in the Navy
at the same time we had out uniforms on, but I have never
received money by telling people I was in the navy. ..

I-am 18 years old and I know that I should have registered
for the Selective Service when I became 18, but I have not sa
registered. I did not present Mr. Sims with a Selective S,rvice
registration or classification card because of course I don't
have any. Nor do I have my Merchant Seaman papers which are
on the §. S. Mills. I intended wearing the uniform I have on
now when I left the S. S. ifills in New York.

whe During the course of the interview with WILLIAMS,
he advised that he has spent a large portion of his life in Key West,
Florida, and that he has a birth certificate on record there showing
phis birthdate to be July 5, 1925. WILLIAMS was unable to present any
K identification papers and stated that he knew that he was supposed to
“4? register for Selective Service when he became eighteen years old but
“S advised that he had been too busy to do so. He denied having any previous
criminal record and did not give any plausible reason for the wearing of
.the United States Navy uniform other than that he just wanted to buy it
and wear it. He said that he purchased the uniform at Watertown, Texas,
a small town not far from Galveston. He admitted having told the Naval
officers who questioned him when he was first apprehended that he had told
them that he was in the Navy but that he had later admitted that this:
was not true. . .

Both subjects were thoroughly questioned as to’
whether they had. obtained anything of value as a result of reporting
themselves to be members of the United States Navye They both denied
having received anything of value other than‘ admitting that while
wearing their uniforms, they had received courtesies from civilians >
such as automobile’rides. They stated that upon registering at the
U.S.0. in Savannah when they spent the night at such place,. that they
merely requested a room for the night but that at such time they were
wearing the uniform. :

Original copies of the above signed statements are
-being retained in the files of the Savannah Field Division. The service
stripes worn by. subject WILLIAMS at the time of apprehension are also
being retained in the files of the Savannah Office.

- spent most of his life in such city. He stated that he has a birth

certificate on record in AtLantic City and that at one time he had a

certified copy of such record which he lost a short time ago. He stated
that both his father and mother are dead and that following the death of
his mother in March 1943, he left Key West, Florida where they had been
living for a short time and returned to Atlantic City. There he resided

with HAROLD MAXWELL, 315 Washington Avenue, for some time and it was

MAXWELL who interested him in-signing up with the Merchant Marine. HAROLD

HERMAN stated that he had been working. HERMAN also said that at the

the boat permitted him and subject to leave their papers on the boat and
that it was through Captain MAXWELL that they were able to leave the boat
and dock without having to show such papers. When questioned as to reason
that he wore the Navy uniforn, HERMAN stated that he had no particular
reason, but just bought it and wore it.
