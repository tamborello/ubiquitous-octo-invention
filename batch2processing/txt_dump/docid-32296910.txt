Re your FD-143 dated 1/13/65.

Authority granted te continue PH 714-C* for an
additional 90-day period. If this source does not produce
significant information during this period, you should give
consideration to recommending that the source be discontinued. (

NOTE: Angelo Bruno is the. powerful La Cosa Nostra underworld
leader’ in Philadelphia. This source is a @ATcwhieH is located

in the automobile of PH 614-C-TE, a valuable top echelon informant
of the Philadelphia Office who has on. occasion allowed Bruno to ?
use this vehicle. Philadelphia Office reports that during the

past two-month period source has produced only limited information
of value. It déditeport information concerning a trip Bruno made
with Philip C. Testa, a "capo" in La Cosa Nostra, to Trenton,

New Jersey, where they met John Simone, who is algo a "capo" in

La Cosa Nostra. Philadelphia Office reports that during the past
two months source was operative on 12 occasions; however, in many

of these instances persons in contact with Bruno did not appear

to have any importance with respect to the Bureau's investigation
'of Bruno. The cost of maintaining this source is mimima@k. In

the past Bruno has used this car when he did not want to be
| surveilled and therefore did not use his personally owned vehicle.
: Ih view of the potential of this source, recommend Philadelphia
nme HE authorized to continue source for an additional 90-day period.
