MM 105-1598 Conriadatial \

U. S. Border Patrol and U. S. Customs immediately
instituted physical surveillances at Polk City and North
Perry Airports.

: Miami Office immediately contacted MM 639-Ss,
who is in touch with STURGIS, and MM 635-S, who is in

contact with DIAZ LANZ. Both informants advised infor-

mation received by Border Patrol highly unlikely in that
STURGIS and LANZ at the present time have no such plans. ww)

On 7/28/63, Border Patrol stated nothing had
developed, apparently the information was false, no
Bellanca airplane ever appeared or was identified, this
might have been a publicity stunt by STURGIS and the
surveillance would be discontinued at midnight.

On 7/29/63, Bocder Patrol advised that as of
12:01 AM the surveillance was discontinued, the infor-
mation was obviously false and they were taking no
further action in this matter. :

The above information is not being set‘ forth
in form suitable for dissemination inasmuch as it appears
that Border Patrol had received false information, Miami
Office did not participate and Miami informants immediately
advised that the allegation was highly unlikely and no
such plans existed. :
