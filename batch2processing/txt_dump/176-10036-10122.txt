MEANT TO DO. THIS | COULD BE DONE PEACEFULLY ) ,

D) FINALLY, “AND MOST IMPORTANT, WE DO NOT RPT NOT CONCLUDE THAT
ANY OF OFFICERS WITH ACTUAL MILITARY STRENGTH IN SAIGON (DON,
DENH, TUNG) IS AT THIS POINT DISAFFECTED WITH PRESIDENT OR WITH

DISPOSED TO ACT IN THIS WAY. MOREOVER, THERE 15 NO SHOW J NG THAT

ACTION ON OUR PART IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD SEEM TO BE A

‘SHOT IN THE DARKs SITUATION AT THIS TIME DOES NOT CALL FOR

THAT, TN MY JUDGMENT, AND 1 BELIEVE WE SHOULD BIDE OUR THE,
