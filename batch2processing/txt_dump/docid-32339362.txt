Sinancia muneration, not because of any allegiance to U.S.
indicateg ie could assist CIA in Latin America in his position as head of
FPCC? :

Interviewing Agents stated that Gibson is weasel-like character,
levasive, opportunistic, with very lit or no moral fiber at all. These
Agents are of the opinion that he lied{e rning his knowledge of
subsidization of EFCC by Cuban Government K New York is of the opinion
that Gibson should be recontacted within hext week or so at which time
specific program could be worked out with Gibson for disruption and
ultimate dissolvement of FPCC. It indicated it would not zed. ee specifi

commitment or deal for payment to Gipson-when he is contacted. w Lork a
recommended that Gibson's request to b laced in contact with CIA b el
in abeyancegintil such time as a determination could be made as to whethe |

we could utilize hit» u) ws
OBSERVATIONS:
. . . t
|. . Gibson's dislike of FBI would indicate he could never be controlial
as source or informant. - It does not appear that the risk involved would be

|
worth our attempting to operate him, especially in view of the fact that :
FPCC is pretty well disorganized at present time and has lost much of its
popular appeal and membership. We feel that we should have no part of any
deals with him and that New York should be instructed not to initiate
future contact with him but accept any data he might furnish if he should
call at our New York Office. ‘IA sh a be advised of Gibson's interest in
getting in touch with eee ))
