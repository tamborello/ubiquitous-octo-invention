in the Anti-Racketeering case, and in accordance with Bureau
regulations, is not set out in details of this ITAR report.

On 7/9/63, Miami Confidential Informant MM 869-PC advised SA
C. GRAHAM HURST he had heard subject NESLINE, CHARLES TOURINE,
and a third individual from St. Marys County, Md., were recently
convicted of local gambling charges in Md. Source heard that oe
the third individual is the man who allegedly put in the ‘fix" ‘
for this gambling operation. This third individual was
understood to be very close to a "millionaire" and it was through
this millionaire that the third individual had pout in the fix,
except of course, for the arresting officer... Informant heard
that the millionaire was very upset and they were afraid he was
ready to tell everything to the FBI.

From the foregoing and information previously developed, it was
apparent that the "third individual" was ALLEN CHARLES FISHER

and his millionaire friend PHILIP E, GRAY who owned the Sportsman's
Club Restaurant and the buildings in’ which NESLINE and his
associates were arrested for gambling on 6/13/63. GRAY was
interviewed on 7/19/63 and the results incorporated into an

BUCKLEY that subject NESLINE has been spending a substantial
amount of time at his residence, 1903 Chillum Road, Avondale,
Maryland, during the previous two weeks. GEORGE ROHANNA was a
frequent visitor to NESLINE's residence during the period.
Informant advised that NESLINE planned to attend the Marlboro
Race Track during the current meeting and that NESLINE would
probably accept wagers from the numerous gamblérs, and bookies
would be in daily attendance at that track. Informant said that
although NESLINE had been to race tracks frequently during the
past few months (Rosecroft and Laurel Raceways), he seldom bets
on the races. '

On 7/i7/63, WF 1108-C advised SA BUCKLEY that NESLINE had been
living in the District of Columbia for the previous few davs
to avoid harrassment by Maryland law enforcement officials and
constant visits and calls from members of the area gambling
