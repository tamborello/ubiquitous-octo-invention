NEUTRALITY MATTER .

 
 

* ia
Reference is made to your memorandum of Geptenbey 2¥, 1960,
in which you requested to be advised whether the facts developed
warrant prosecution. .

The report enclosed with your memorandum reflects that
Julio Fernandez Trevejo, who described himself as a very close ©
associate and confidant of Masferrer, furnished the following per-
tinent information concerning the twenty seven man invasion force
which landed in Cuba in October 1960, under the leadership of
Armentino Feria Perez. Masferrer acted as counsel and adviser in
the preparations of this group and was in charge of handling the men
who were to go on the expedition. Four boats were utilized in the
operation. The "Aladino," piloted by Horacio Canizares Padron, was
scheduled to rendevous with the “Sunsport," piloted by Frank Joseph
Williams, at Mira Por Vos, about sixty miles north of Cuba. At this
point, the "Aladino" was to pick up the men, supplies, arms and nec-
essary equipment for the expedition to invade Cuba. The "Sunspo#t"
was to transport the fuel for the “Aladino" to make the trip from Mira
Por Vos to Cuba and return. The "Mary Ann" piloted by Santiago Alvarez,
was to transport the men from Miami-to an island in the Bahamas about
one-half way to Mira Por Vos. A fourth boat, piloted by an individual
know only as Cartaya, was to transport the arms, uniforms and equip-
ment to an island somewhere in the Bahamas, approximately midway between
Miami and Mira Por Yos. Masferrer knew that arms and ammunition were
to be transported on one of the boats and all the persons involved knew
_ they were to embark on a military expedition. At this point, Fernandez'
statement is non-specific concerning details but apparently all four
boats did participate to some extent in the invasion. Fernandez made
available a book which reflected the contributions received and monies i -

Masferrer advised on December 6, 1960, that he was partially
responsible for this expedition. He stated that the members thereof
were organized in the United States with the knowledge they were to,
embark on a military expedition against Cuba. He explained that Santiage
Alvarez transported the arms on his boat the “Mary Ann" to a location
in the vicinity of Gun Key in the Bahamas for this expedition. It is
noted that Alvarez, upon being interviewed on October 10, 1960, advised
that he did not possess any pertinent information concerning the in-
vasion force which departed from Miami on September 26, 1960.

     
   
  
  

 

It is our present intention to send two ee eme4nte t
to Miami to present this entire matter before a \g jurs the 2 early
spart of next week. It is anticipated that these\attorneys will arrive

th Miami on January 6, 1) 60. In the meaptime,-it\is requested that you
oypefnandez \and Evel ToxAlpizar

 
     
 
 
 

we det@rmine whether Fr: ni iams,

woulda be willing to te tify in the évéx prosecution were ufdertaken -

against Masferrer under the neutrality statutes. It is also requested \

~ that you attempt to interviewthe individuals identified by Fernandez

and listed above concerning their own and Masferrer's participation in
the organization of the expedition of, September 26, 1960, as well as
their willingness to testify. , ,

We noted that the report of Special Agent James D. Hayes dated

. November 17, 1960, set forth information concerning the establishment

of a training area at No Name Key, Florida. We noted that seventeen of

the individuals on No Name Key. were interviewed and each advised they
|! had gone there voluntarily and without compensation. They explained that
|: for the most part they were in dire financial straits » and in addition to
getting into good physical condition, they were able to live without any
expenses. All expenses were presumably paid by Masferrer or his associ-~
ates and these individuals advised that they were not presently aware of
the existence of any plans for the formation of an invasion or expedition
H . against Cuba. A physical inspection of No Name Key by Bureau agents
failed to disclose any firearms.

However, we also noted that an article which appeared in the
"Washington Post and Times Herald" on December 26, 1960, indicated that
23 Americans and 200 Cubans from Miami and New York, commanded by
Masferrer, were making final preparations to invade Cuba.. If this in-
\ formation can be established by Sompetent available evidence »@ ® prosecution

for violation of 18 U.S.C. 960 may be warranted. Accordingly, it
is requested that investigation be continued in this regard.

In the interest of expediting this matter before the
grand jury it would be appreciated if the Bureau would furnish the
} | results of their additional investigation to thé Departmental
}/ attorneys in Miami as it becomes available.
