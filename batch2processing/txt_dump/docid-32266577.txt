_ Before I move on any further, I would be negligent at
the very least if I did not also point out we had staff mem~
bers from each one of the members of the task force who worked
very, very hard, in fact, an awful lot of work preparing
the documentation, seeking out the materials from the Library
of Congress, making contact and phene:calis: with all the -
people across the country. Our guess is that this total
process took somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 to 400
manhours over the period of two and a hal£ to three weeks,
which is really quite extensive.

: At any rate, we had a first go-round where we contacted o

looked at some 64 individuals on paper. From that list of 64

‘we narrowed down as a group 17 candidates that we thought

should be interviewed personally, if they would be so willing.
Of that list of 17 that we contacted, six expressed a sincere
interest in serving as chief counsel and staff director of cnt
committee. | |
We interviewed all six of them and felt we should go
further. From that group we were not satisfied entirely with
the individuals that we had had a chance to talk ‘to, so we
then went back through the same process again, looking at a
list of 47 to 50 people, again by contacting various people
around the country, various organizations and so forth.

From that group of 50 we narrowed Lt downto another grour

@ 2 I really. ought” to. take the opportunity to say to you, my

are people that are very dedicated to the job that they have
undertaken. r think with a permanent chief counsel they will
perform very well. I thank you for your kind words...

The Chairman. “hank you very. much,. Tom.

Now we will move then to that next subject, which is the
10 || search for a new chief counsel. Chris Dodd, as you know, was
11 | appointed as chiarman of a task force to conduct this search.

He and this task force has done a tremendous job. They have’

and to contact various individuals who have been recommended |

to us for consideration. And I would like at this time to

16 | permanent chief counsel. Some.of the problems that are there

17 | are those that would be in that kind of organization under the

to give those individuals. some additional direction in those -
areas where they have done this enormous amount of work. And
what they have also asked -is that you would perhaps work with

them and you select ‘an area of investigation of which you are
