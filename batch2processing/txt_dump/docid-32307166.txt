ADMINISTRATIVE:

Mr. ALTON BRYANT furnished information reported
in this report from the records of General Telephone Company
of Florida, Tampa, Florida, and requested his identity be
protected.

A careful review of this file reflects that investi-
gation to date has failed to develop information indicating
any current criminal activity on the part of subject. He
does have associates who are involved in gambling and boxing
and on the fringe of the criminal element. It is not believed,
however, that this subject is of sufficient statuffe to warrant
continued investigation under the criminal intelligence pro-
gram and after he is interviewed, it is anticipated that this
case will be closed.
