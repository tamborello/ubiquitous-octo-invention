c. Further inquiries in Mexico by our officials there revealed
that Nicolas DAMASCUS. had been ordered to. leave Mexico in October
1960 solely because of the expiration of his tourist card, which had been i
once extended, Mexican. Records fail to show that he returned to Mexico,
following his entry into the United States at Brownsville, Texas, from
Matamoros, Tamaulipas on 24 October 1960, Upon arrival in Mexico on
22 June 1960, he indicated that the purpose of his visit was to attend the
wedding of his sister, Anastasie, identified in preceding paragraph,
however, as of 21 June 1961, there was no record of Anastasie
DAMASCUS aka DAMASCOU in official Mexican Files, and there was
as yet no identification of the individual she was alleged to have been
scheduled to marry. From the same source it was learned that for the
period 22. June through.6.September 1960, the only address listed in.
official indices. for Nicolas DAMASCUS is/c/o Justo SIERRA, Reforma
95- 407,] Mexico City, which is the law offf€e maintained by{Iusto. SIERR. S)
Casasus, former Counselor of the Mexican Embassyfin Washington, D.C, (S)
and who is. further identified in the documents cited In paragraph 1, c.
through h. above. DAMASCUS reportedly used{SIERRA}to attempt to(S) i
obtain an extension of his tourist permit, although the details of his cén- |
tacts with and knowledge o{ SIERRA imself are not known at this. ae)

Neither has it been.possible as of this date to verify the reported con- :
tact between Nicolas. DAMASCUS and Subjects at the Hotel New: Yorker,
as reported by Mr. Thomas DONLON.,. Investigation efforts abroad by
_ this Agency are continuing, however, and any further information
developed will be forwarded as soon as. available. .
