Political >risoner
{ in Hospital —

Clémart Joseph Charles was taken
from the National Penitentiary in Port
au~Prince to Haiti's General Hospital.
The former Duvalier tanker has been
jailed since 1$/1 “for political reasons.’
No proper trial was held.

Mr, Carles is suffering from an
acute liver infection acd the physi-
cians zttexting him have warned that
he will die unless he's allowed to tra-
vel abroad for special treatment,

This isn’t the first time Mr, Char-
Jes was teken from his cell to a hos~
pital, Last year he was rushed to
Haiti's military hospital for treapment.
of the same disease.

Mrs, Charles has been allowed to
wisit her ‘susband.

This is the first time the Duvalier
regime has acted half humanely with 2
political prisoner. It's been pointed
out that Narie-Denise Duvalier Domi~
mique, a friend of Mr. Charles, has
often interceded for him.
