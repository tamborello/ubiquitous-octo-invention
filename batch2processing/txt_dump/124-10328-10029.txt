It is to be noted that these records reflected a
check dated 7-14-59, was made payable to the St. Moritz
Hotel ef New York City in the amount of $29.28. It should
be noted too, that in records of the subject's new account i
at the Union Trust Company there is a check dated 7-13-59, :
made payab the St. Moritz Hotel in the amount of fifty ot
dollars. GAA ) -,

In regard to the serial numbers of currency ~

being deposited by the subject at Riggs National Bank, .

a number of serial numbers of subject's deposits have been

obtained and have been made a part of the instant file.

As of 6-30-59, however, this practice has been discontinued
Finasmuch as New York has disclosed that payments to DAJANY Cx)

were being made by bank money orders and in some cases from

the Israeli United Nations account, In the event a. comparison

of currency is desired in the future, this procedure can |

accomplished from the information already in the file. % (2)

Bureau attention is directed to letter from \
Office of Security, Department of State, dated 6-25-59, :
attaching the report of Agent E. H. WIDDIFIELD of the '
State Department, dated 6-13-59. It was indicated that a
photograph of DAJANY had been exhibited to DONALD L, SNOOK
of Tripoli (no date). SNOOK was said to positively have
identified the subject as being the person he had furnished '
information on previously. In this regard, Office of i
Security reports of WIDDIFIELD, dated 2-9-59, and 4-10-59, - ~
set out,information concerning OMAR : AJANY and UMAR NM Lua
__FAROUENDAJANI which were obviously not identical with the (/“¢ 7"
subject of instant case. DAJANY has been continuously —~
residing in the U. S. since 1951, Although SNOOK identified ax
a photograph of subject, he did not specifically indicate
\ with whom subject was identical. It appears that he does
not know the subject and the information furnished by ye)

PATTON volunteered that he had two more rolls of similar
film in his car, also obtained from OFFAR, and produced those
rolls of film, An examination of all three rolls indicated
they were copies of well known editions of pornographic film,
It had been copied on film belonging to Byron, Incorporated. (%)

OFFAR was also interviewed at that time and said he
had obtained the films from EDDIE REYNOLDS,a former employee
who was then in Tennessee, . The films were confiscated by ;
Inspector BLICK and no further action taken, (6 :

training films for the FBI and has clearance for similar work
for the Armed Forces. 6). :
