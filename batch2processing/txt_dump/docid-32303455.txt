i PH 614-C-TE furnished following information re
activities 6/26/63.

Bookkeeper at John's. Vending Company, ANTHONY (LNU),
who is reported to be HARRY RICCOBENE's representative in '
the business, discussed results of most recent meeting Pennsyl-
vania State Pardons Board. ANTHONY said (Attorney General
EUGENE) ALESSANDRONI and Judge BLACK (probably GENEVIEVE BLATT,
Secretary Internal Affairs) voted against commutation. BRUNO
said ALESSANDRONI is a "bad man" (cannot be reached), and
BRUNO's’ contact man died. In past, BRUNO has used MITCHELL
’ COHEN, who died suddenly 6/22 as contact man in various fixes.
BRUNO then attempted to reach AL SCHWARTZ, a bail bondsman with
whom he has previously dealt. BRUNO also indicated possibility
of using Philadelphia City Councilman EMMANUEL WEINBERG, but.
the person who contacts him tried to borrow $1500 from BRUNO
and if BRUNO asks favor, he will have to make the loan. A.

; BRUNO has been called to INS, possibly in connection
with his recent reentry to United States from Dominican Republic
when he had forgotten his wife's passports, as reported 6/24
by PH 591-C*, ;
