NOTE FOR:
FROM: :
DATE: :22:04 PM

SUBJECT: Agee Memo - New draft

 

 

Here itis... with Jeremy's improvements. Please read it carefully as | had to rush through this. Some of Jeremy's comments were slight
wording changes so as not to offend “the Board" so you may not notice much change. The biggest substantive change was on my FOIA
section (I have skillfully crafted this section to avoid the use of that four letter word!). Please note there is one more paragraph now
because | did add a bit about Scelso being an “official”. And don't forget to attach to Stokes-DC1 fatter which | will fax back to you.

Have fun - and let me know if you need help.
