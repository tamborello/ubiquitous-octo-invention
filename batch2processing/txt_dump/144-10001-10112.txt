The Cuban affair has abruptly returned to the ‘forefront with
the republication of articles written for L'Express by Mr, JEAN -
DANIEL after his conversations with President’ KENNEDY and: CASTRO,
first in the weekly The New Sepublic, and then in the New York
Times-and the Washington Post. From the.‘comments of the American
press, I might single out the following elements: :

1. Although President KENNEDY did indeed mention Hungary
in his conversation with Mr. ADZHUBEL--Mr. PIERRE SALINGER has
just acknowledged it after haying denied it--it was only, according
to the White House spokesman, to show the importance of: Cuba to the
United States. On the othér hand, the President did not make any
allusion to the fact that the United States was a passive witness
to the Seviet intervention in Hungary in 1956. In any‘case, since
The Eay of Pigs, President KENNEDY never had any intention of invad-
ing Cuba. He categorically answered a question on this subject by
Mr. ADZHUBEL in: the negative.

“The administration puts no trust in CASTRO'S
scatemanta’ ‘to the effect that the Soviets installed rockets in
Cuba to-‘prevent an invasion of the island by the United States.

At most, it is thought here that Mr. KHRUSHCHEV may: have told
CASTRO that the installation of these rockets was indispensable to
his country! s defense,

3. Mr. KRUSHCHEV' s decision is still explained : ‘by his wish
to compensate quickly: and cheaply for the Soviet Union's strategic.
inferiority. Moreover, as a study by the Rand Corporation recalls,
this is what CASTRO told Mr. JULIEN of Le Monde when he admitted:
"It was not to ensure our, own defense that we accepted ‘the rockets,
but to reinforce the socialist camp's position. This is the truth,
even if others provide different explanations,"

4, However that may be, the: publication of these interviews
puts President JOHNSON in a delicate position. As Mr. CHALMERS
ROBERTS remarked in the Washington Post, Mr. KHRUSHCHEV's
emissaries hint that perhaps an arrangement is possible between
the United. States and CASTRO. The latter,. in his interview with
Mr. DANIEL, intimated that he might put an énd to his terrorist
agitation campaign in Latin America if the United States lifted
its economic blockade of the island. Therefore, Mr. ROBERTS
acknowledges, this perhaps gives a margin to the United States
for maneuvering, but "only a short time after having’ acceded to
the presidency and only a year before the elections, Mri JOHNSON's
possibilities for action in this field are very limited.".. +
