Dear Mr Porter

Iam writing a book about the cultures and backgrounds of people who
appear in the Warren Report. I have several questions which relate to matters
which are not in the Warren Report nor in any other official document concerned
with the Kennedy Assassination. - I enclose two sets of question. The first is a

-__ simple one and I hope that you can comment upon it.

There is, in the Warren Report, a disagreement between F.B.I. Special

Agent Vincent Drain and Dallas Police Lt. Carl Day. On the afternoon of the’

assassination, the Dallas Police discovered a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, later

" identified as the murder weapon. Day and Capt Will Fritz of Dallas P.D.

DoclId:32321506 Page 2

handled the weapon. Fritz operated the bolt with his bare hand and there is a
television shot of the rifle being carried overhead, by the stock, by a person
(presumably a Dallas Police Officer) holding it with his bare hand. The weapon
had, been, according to Day's testimony, checked visually, with a magnifying
glass, by Day before it was carried to Day's office at headquarters, but Day had

‘not dusted the weapon for prints.

Day testified that he found no prints on the weapon until he took it apart
and then he found a palm print. He turned the weapon over to F.B.L Special ~
Agent Vincent Drain on the evening of November 22nd, 1963, and Drain took it
to Washington. The F.B.I. examined the weapon in Washington and found no
prints on it. This is all in the Warren Report.

Day testified before the Warren Commission that when he turned the
weapon over to Drain, he told Drain that there was a palm print. Drain testified
that Day did not mention a palm print nor any other print. Who is telling the
truth?

There must have been a clip but in all the testimony, no one mentions finding
one, seeing one, or examining one.

5. Posner calls his book "Case Closed". Has the Kennedy case indeed been
closed, or is it an open investigation? ’

I should appreciate comments on these matters. I believe that the public
has a right to know. These answers cannot be found in the Warren Report nor in
the HSCA report on assassinations. I believe it to be ifnportant to solve the -
crime. I do not plan to point fingers at this error or that. The gross error lay in
permitting the slaying of Oswald, and this was not an F.B.I. matter. It is
important to understand the investigation in order to understand the crime.

Reputations are at stake. If Drain did his job properly, then let the public record
so indicate. ~

Thank you for your time and trouble in answering this letter. I will send
you my book when it is finished.

Yours ae where
