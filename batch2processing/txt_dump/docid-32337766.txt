NOTE: Classified "Secret" because coverage of diplomatic establish- .°
ments by Bureau is so classified. CIA is engaging in speculation.
Reference letter appareatly Suggests a theorynthat because Nicolas
_ Damascus, who reportedly lived at one of the hotels Wisitted by
Mitchell and Martin in Mexico City, had an apparent client relation-
ship with the law office in Mexico City of the present {Counselor of
the Mexican Embass: n Washington, .D.C., who has recen ly as 1954
broke a luncheon efgagement with a Soviet diplomat and in 1957
received a phone call from a. representative of the 26th of July
movement, there might be some answer here as to the defection of
Mitchell.and Martin. The logic of all this is not too apparent
