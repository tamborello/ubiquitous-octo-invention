Source Comments

! 1. It is believed chat the lack of the traditional exchange of Christmas
t greetings between the Mexican Government and the Cuban Enbassy was

the result of the resentment caused among Mexican offictaldom by the

strong note dated 26 November 1963, received by the Mexican Minieiry
“4 of Foreign Relations from Raul Roa Garcia, Cuban Minister of Foreign
. : Relations, over the detention by Mexican authorities of Silvia Tirado
. de Duran, Mexican employee of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, in
connection with the visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City of Lee
. / Harvey Oswald, alleged assassin of John F, Kennedy, former Preaident
of the United States,

2. It 4s telfeved that the Cuban Government's refusal to give Del Rio a
visa {8 also related to Roa's note and the Cuban Government's desire to

avoid antagonizing the Mexican Government further.
