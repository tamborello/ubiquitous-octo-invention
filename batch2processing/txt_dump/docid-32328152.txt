Reference New York letter to Bureau dated June 16567
1958. ie

Referenced New York letter sets forth a substantial Maf@
amount of information furnished by PCI con-
‘cerning American gambling activities in Cuba as we as Ameri-
can gamblers in Cuba. For the assistance of the New York Of-
fice in evaluating information furnished by — it should
be noted that the majority of the information set forth in
referenced letter has been previously furnished to the Havana
Office by sources considered reliable. It appears that when
this PCI furnishes information concerning which he has per-
sonal knowledge, the information furnished is reliable. It
should be noted, however, that in furnishing opinions con-
cerning individuals he tends to state generalities which are
not true.

Pages 7 and 8 of referenced letter make reference to
information furnished by NY 1894-C indicating that informant
had been troduced by_HENRY_'!BUSTERY lL toa Cubaf. referred
to as Mr. SQUE." Informant was unable to further identify
"BOSQUE.'’ For the information of the Bureau and New York,
"BOSQUE". is believed to be identical with FREDESVINDO \BOSQUE_
CUETO, FBI Number..420934. This individual has been associated
with"Cuban gambling since the early 1950s. He was an important LQ
figure in the old National Casino in Havana which operated be- (3

associated for many years with gambling operations at the : (I

of the more important American gambling figures in Havana.
