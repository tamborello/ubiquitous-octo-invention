HE RECORD

Subject: Outline of Covert Operations

My other memorandum on this same subject today describes
the tasking by Deputy Secretary Gilpatric and the handling of this
highly sensitive information. The acquisition of the information
is noted in this present memorandum.

After Deputy Secretary Gilpatric gave me the requirement
last night, I talked to BE (who was acting for Bill
Harvey while Harvey was out of town). I sketched in the purpose,
which was to get a fix for Gilpatric as one of the U.S. negotiators
with the Soviets on whether or not all actions (sabotage, etc.)
had come to a stop. I mentioned that this was.a sensitive point
brought up by Adlai Stevenson when he talked with the U.S.
negotiators in New York; he didn't want the U.S. embarrassed
and Gilpatric wanted to be sure of this. .€hééver commented that
he hoped my memorandum wasn't going to be shown to Stevenson;
I reassured him that I was writing it as an ‘eyes only'' for Gilpatric,
but it must be correct.

 

Il asked about covert operational assets both inside Cuba and
outside, if they had stop orders on actions. :Bmuce said that they
all had such orders, but pointed out that some of the Cuhans were

 

 

quite emotional about stopping actions against Castro and he wasn't ©

certain that everyone would hold to the orders.

I then asked about assets inside Cuba, did they only have the |
two action teams there? How about any psychological operations?

yBruce said he believed there were only the two teams and would

check further to be sure: He knew the teams were supposed to be
collecting intelligence. As for psychological operations, all CLA
assets had been turned over to USLA.for operational use. Lasked
about the balloon operation. He said that this was not in being yet.

This morning I talked to‘Brucé again, checking the points
in my memorandum. He said that there were only the two action
teams, a smali one (Central Cuba) and the big one (200-man in
Western Cuba), but they definitely were on intelligence collection.
I asked if all others were under control,‘no boats going out, etc.
He said yes, but again pointed out that the Cubans were restive.
I then asked if any independent groups were in motion. He said
CIA couldn't guarantee any groups not under CIA control, but that
the word had gotten around to stop actions at this time and none
were known to CIA currently, although maybe there was one not
known to CLA. I commented again that any action would embarrass
the negotiations, which was why I was asking..-#
understood.

 

I then checked with Don Wilson, USIA, who confirmed that
all CIA psychological assets had been turned over to USIA for
operational use and were being used as desired by the President.
I checked with Bob Hurwitch, State, to see if he knew of any
actions in preparation or on the way; he said no, everything
appeared to be ata halt. I checked with General Johnson to see
if any U.S. military activity might have a Cuban action group. "
He said no, there are firm orders holding such actions.

I then wrote the "eyes only’’ memorandum to show to Mr,
Gilpatric, on "Outline of Covert Operations."
