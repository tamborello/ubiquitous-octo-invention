WILLIAM JAMES, TWA, advised on December 5,
1963, that SUZANNE FUEGER using the name of DIETGARD
FUEGER departed from O'Hare International Airport at
3 p.m. on TWA flight 800 enroute to Paris, France and
Munich, Germany traveling alone. Her plane was scheduled
to arrive Idlewild Airport, 5:53 p.m. where they will
have a short layover and depart from Idlewild 7 p.m.
via TWA to Paris. It is to be noted that in all contacts
with WILLIAM JAMES no record of any reservations was found
for GUS ALEX. In this connection it is believed that
he was planning to travel to New York City by domestic
airlines ‘and thereafter leave from New York for Paris
on an unknown overseas airlines.

Munich, Germany Police advised that they had
received information from the West German Federal Criminal
Police that DIETGARD FUEGER had arrived in Munich, Germany
on December 6, 1963, as scheduled where she was met by
her mother, ELROSE FUEGER. West German Federal Criminal
Police also advised that SUZANNE and her mother were
staying at the Bayerischerhof for three days. FUEGER
was not known to have been contacted by anyone outside
of her mother during this three-day stay in Munich. The
West German Federal Criminal Police further advised .that
SUZANNE and her mother left the above named hotel at
about noon on December 8, 1963,.enroute to Riederau.

SUZANNE informed the management of the hotel
of the loss of a platinum chain with a heart shaped
locket containing diamonds of approximately three karats.
FUEGER did not make a formal complaint or report the theft
to the police. Instead she advised the hotel employees
that she would first check at home in America to see if
she left the jewelry at home. West German Federal Criminal
Police advised that ALEX was not observed in Munich.

A member of the Police Judiciaire (criminal
police), Surete Nationale,. arrived at Orly Airport,
Paris, France, at 8:25 a.m., December 6, 1963, and
departed at 9:05 a.m. the same date enroute to Munich,
Germany. FUEGER remained "in transit" and therefore i
there is no official record of her having entered France {
on that date. :
