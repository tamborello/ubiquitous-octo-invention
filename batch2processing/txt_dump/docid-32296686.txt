INTERNAL SECUIITY - CUBA

This publication also carried an item stating
that at an executive meeting of the JCR and ASI, Miami,

. Florida, it was agreed to support the Cuban Medical

Association in Exile in its tribute to President JOSE
FIGUERES of Costa Rica, to work together in the underground
inside Cuba,to free political prisoners whereever they may —
be, to repudiate co-existence with CASTRO Communism and

to. give total support. for a Government in Arms on Cuban
territory.

On March 7, 1972, MM T-1 advised that CONRADO
RODRIGUEZ::indicated that members of the JCR in New York
City had been involved in an attack ona diplomatic car
in New York City during the recent past. RODRIGUEZ,
however, did not identify the place or the car involved
in this alleged attack. He said the name of the JCR had
not been used since members of the JCR are being constantly
watched by the FBI. . :

RODRIGUEZ also disclosed that he is making contact

with various labor. organizations in Latin America in order

to develop a plan to attack Communists and pro-Communists
in Latin America. He claimed to have already: received: the
backing. of at least three labor groups. He also disclosed
that a friend of his is talking with members of the Costa
Rican government as it is necessary to have a sanctuary

in a Latin American. country ‘in.order to carry out this plan
of attack. . .

oo RODRIGUEZ mentioned, according to MM T-1, that he
had received a communication from a Bolivian labor leader
who indicated that members of his organization are willing
to fight along side the Cuban exiles in their battle against
the CASTRO Regime. He indicated that acts of Sabotage in
Latin America are being considered as a means of carrying out
this plan of attack.

RODRIGUEZ again stated that he has received
news from New York that his men are still determined
to carry out acts of sabotage against democratic -
establishments of countries which maintain economic or
commercial relations with the CASTRO Regime, however, he
did not furnish any specific information as to the exact
targets, time schedule or other pertinent details.

: It is to be noted that on January 9, 1972, the
"Washington Capitol News Service" made a press release
reporting that a car belonging to the Cuban Mission to
the United Nations was scorched when a rag was placed
inside the gas tank and set afire. The article related
that an anonymous caller, speaking Spanish, said that

the "Commando de Cuba Rebelde'"(Rebel Cuban Command) was
responsible and that “this is the beginning of what Cuban
diplomatic ‘representatives here can expect".

RE: ACCION SINDICAL INDEPENDIENTE (ASI)
(INDEPENDENT LABOR ACTION)
INTERNAL SECURITY -. CUBA

JUNTA CUBANA REVOLUCIONARIA (JCR)
(CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY BOARD)
INTERNAL SECURITY =- CUBA |

re Previous investigation has reflected that the

-’- Aecion Sindical Independiente (ASI) (Independent Labor
Action) is the labor group of the Junta Cubana
Revolucionaria (JCR) (Cuban Revolutionary Board). Both
are composed of Cuban exiles in Miami and in New York
City. The ASI is headquartered in Miami and the JCR in
New York City. CONRADO RODRIGUEZ SANCHEZ, a Cuban :
exile, who is a former labor leader in Cuba, now residing
in Miami, represents both of these organizations in Miami.

In October, 1971, MM T-1, who is well-acquainted
with some members of the ASI in Miami, reported that

RODRIGUEZ had disclosed, that his men in New York and Washing~
ton "were .accumulating’plastic explosives to blow up democratic

  
  
 
 

Cl NQigvstablishments" belonging to countries that maintain relations
a & with the CASTRO Regime of Cuba. Shortly thereafter agents
La of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Miami and

brad = New York City interviewed RODRIGUEZ and several other indi-
SBM viduals who were alleged to. be leaders of the ASI and JCR.

= 8 Fa, They denied involvement in. any such plan. Several days

a. NN later; according ‘to MM T-1, RODRIGUEZ expressed the opinion
=o that the ASI and JCR people in New York City were crazy since
x they intendéd to continue with their bombing plans despite
=~ the fact that the FBI had obtained information concerning

OX on, these plans. ee

Current Developments

The January 28, 1972 issue of the Spanish languag

publication "Cuba Espera", Miami, Florida, carried an :
article which consisted of a photograph of a group of men

described as executives of the ASI ang, JCR in Florida.
