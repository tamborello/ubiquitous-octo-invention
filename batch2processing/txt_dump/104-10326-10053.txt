[KONE OF AUSTRIA AND THE NEW ORGANIZATION WAS GIVEN
RADIOS SO THEY COULD KEEP IN TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER.

      

 

 

| PEOPLE PUT CACHES OF WEAPONS, AMMUNITION,
FOOD, AND UNIFORMS INTO THE GROUND IN OVER 70 PLACES IN THE U.S.
ZONE AND ELSEWHERE. OLAH’'S GROUP WAS TO BE GIVEN THE LOCATION OF
THE CACHES WHEN THE.RED ARMY MOVED. ;

 

RECENTLY THE US GOVERNMENT REVEALED TO THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT ©
THE EXISTENCE OF THESE CACHES AND THE EMBASSY GAVE AUSTRIAN
OFFICIALS THE LOCATIONS OF THESE CACHES. AUSTRIAN PRESS, RADIO, AND
TV COVERAGE OF ALL THIS. HAS BEEN GENERALLY FAVORABLE AND EVEN
GRATEFUL. OLAH'S INVOLVEMENT IS KNOWN FROM HIS MEMOIRS AND FROM
STATEMENTS HE MADE DURING HIS TRIAL IN THE 1960'S (HE WAS TRIED,
CONVICTED, AND-SERVED ONE YEAR FOR USING A LABOR UNION SAVINGS
ACCOUNT AS SECURITY FOR A LOAN TO BUY THE KRONEN ZEITUNG, A TABLOID
WHICH NOW HAS THE LARGEST CIRCULATION IN AUSTRIA. THE TWO MEN,
{(DICHAND)) AND ((FALK)), HE CHOSE TO RUN THE PAPER, THEN TOOK IT
OVER AS THEIR PERSONAL PROPERTY, BECOMING ALMOST THE RICHEST MEN IN
AUSTRIA. DICHAND LATER SOLD OUT TO FALK AND FOUNDED ANOTHER TABLOID.

 

IN MEETINGS WITH OLAH, HE WAS ACCOMPANIED
BY HIS.TWO "SECRETARIES," JOSEF ((LAS)) AND HEINRICH ((DAURER)).
LAS WENT TO JAIL FOR THE SAME OFFENSE AS OLAH AND DAURER MAY HAVE,

TOO.

 

 

 

 

 

 

FROM A TV SHOW THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 26, 1996, I LEARNED THERE
ARE AT LEAST TWO EAGER YOUNG AUSTRIAN HISTORIANS WORKING TO LEARN
ALL THE FACTS ABOUT THIS CASE. ONE HAD SHEAVES OF TOP SECRET
DOCUMENTS FROM THE STATE AND DEFENSE DEPTS. BEARING ON U.S. SCHEMES
TO RE-ARM AUSTRIA.

IF MY NAME IS REVEALED, IT WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY SEVERAL
AUSTRIAN OFFICERS I HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS. AUSTRIAN TELEVISION CAN |
SHOW SEVERAL LENGTHY INTERVIEWS WITH ME ON THE 1993 OCCASION OF THE
150TH JUBILEE OF THE VIENNA MEN’S SINGING SOCIETY, WHICH I HAVE :
BELONGED TO SINCE 1972. OLAH, LAS, AND DAURER CAN ALL RECOGNIZE ME.
