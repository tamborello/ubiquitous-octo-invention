cee SEORET

Enclosed LHM sets forth info. from ELISEO‘GOMEZ which
conceals’ his identity with T symbol. During interview he
indicated he was in the employ of another U.S, Govt: agency.
He. admitted having. data’ re Haitian interests and having con-
tacted WESSIN, but. would not divulge same without clearing
with the other agency. -

Miami has noted in previous. correspondence that

‘WESSIN is closely associated with Cuban exiles MARCOS DIAZ

LANZ and ANTONIO! LLANOMMONTES, noting further that info de- -
veloped in past re these individuals indicates they are :.
probably associated with WESSIN for mercenary reasons. © Be-
cause of these probable intentions, it does not appear these
individuals.will provide this Bureau current and pertinent
info re WESSIN’s activities.

Other Cubans like GOMEZ who 3 are apparently close
to WESSIN in some instances have contacts with CIA and can
not be expected, since they are receiving CIA pay, to provide
the same data to this Bureau for fear of jeopardizing their

‘CIA connections. u

In this regard it is noted MM-761-S has stated he--
personally knows that numerous Cubans/seek and have CIA con-
nections in the Miami area, although IM many instances CIA | ~
does not get value received for this coverage. ] u)

It is.probable that ELISEO GOMEZ is the source of
some of the info re WESSIN contained as enclosure in reBu-
airtel re WESSIN, Because of his connections with. WESSIN
and his expressed desire to cooperate with the Govt., Miami
will endeavor to develope a close relationship with GOMEZ,
recognizing his primary allegiance[yill probably remain with
CIAjand a certain duplication probably will result in ob~
tafning info. from him. u)

At the same time, Miami is attempting to have our
own informants align themselves with WESSIN and/or the Cubans
close to him insofar as time permits, noting.they have other
assignments relating to the Cuban situation in Miami.

Interviews of individuals set forth in the enclosed

LHM were accomplished by SAs. EDWARD J..DAHL and EUGENE L; PAYNE,
