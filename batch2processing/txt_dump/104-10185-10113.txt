“The Communist Party of £1 Salvador had asked me te
send thea twenty-five, one quarter pound packages of ~
gelatin oxplosivea. They requegted that the explosives be
gent to Mexico where they would recover them and take 7 :, 4
thea to El Salvador. oo . a

"In view of the request, I spoke with Manuel PINEIRO
regarding the shipment itself, ss well as the amount.
PINEIRO answered by telling me to do so.

 

“During my trip to Mexico (March 1964) I spoke with
Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez regarding this shipment and he told
me that there was no need of ny sending the explosives
to Mexico as this type of explosive was available in the
Embassy. I then told RODRIGUSZ that I would answer the
request from £1 Salvador.

"Upon returning to Cuba I spoke with PINEIRO, who told
we not to send the explosives as the orders now were to
send nothing but money due to the recent exposure of the
arms shipment to Venezuela."
