ReBulet 5/7/65 which solicited from your office
information concerning the coverage of King being afforded
by the New York City Police Department, particularly any
technical-type coverage.

- The Bureau appreciates the helpful information
7 furnished by your reply airtel 5/18/65. It shall certainly
assist the Bureau in its future considerations relative to
coverage of King. :

Tyo items remain, however, concerning which the
Bureau would appreciate further information. What facts
are known relative to King utilising the tactic of searching
for listening devices in hotel rooms occupied by him or
elsewhere? Your airtel noted that your office had developed
evidence on at least one occasion where the police had
employed microphone coverage of King in a New York hotel.
What are the facts relative to that occasion, including
reason for the coverage and results obtained? .

As origin, Atlanta should be furnished a copy of
your reply.

1 ~ Atlanta (100-5586)

NOTE: We need to know as full particulars as possible
concerning technical coverage being given King by others
so that we may be guided accordingly in our own con-
siderations for such coverage.

ReBulet of 5/7/65, requesting the New York Office
furnish full details of the current interest by the New York
City Police Department in KING. Reference is also made to

New York teletype of 1/9/65.

    
   
 
  

  

Captioned matter has been discussed on an

appropriately discreet basis with Deputy Chief Inspector JOHN

‘KINSELLA, head of the Bureau of Special Services (BSS), New

gorlc City Police Department (NYCPD). The NYO has enjoyed an
xcellent relationship with BSS, and Inspector KINSELLA

has always been very cooperative with this office. BSS,

it may be noted, is a plainclothes investigative branch

of the NYCPD whieh handles such matters as subversive or

security type matters of interest to the PD, racial matters,

some criminal intelligence matters, and it also provides 4 XA

on some occasions plainclothes “bodyguards” for visiting Ay :

dignitaries. In the latter sense, they act in similar 2

capacity to the Secret Service.

Inspector KINSELLA has advised that MARTIN LUTHER

that they endeavor to be aware of his itinerary and activi-

The Governor of Massachusetts is John A. Volpe (R). He vas
elected 11/3/64 and had previously served as Governor from 1961~1963,,
No adverse security information concerning Volpe in Bureau files. —
Relations with -ham have been cordial and in January, 1961, upon his first
election as Governor he was sent a congratulatory letter and a copy of

Handley, Boston, for discreetly-obtained available information concerning
a planned "Day" for King, ASAC Whittaker, Boston, today (3/2/65) télephone:
the following infometion to the Bureau, arrangements for a "Day" for
King have already been firmed up,- It is to be 4/23/65, An award is tp
be made to King, the nature of which has aot yet been determined, Neithe:
has the place for the testimonial yet been determined, . There is no
[[tntoenation that the invitation to King has been definitely extended as
yet. SAC Handley has met the Governor who is cordial and friendly to
the Bureau and Handley believes that the Governor could be safely contacted
ona highly confidential bads and briefed concerning King. with the end

of “the Bureau to have Sac “Handley” personally” meet with the Governor and
