Es : ‘Le .

' this enquiry.

2. : KHATTAR'S REALTIES LTD,, 63 Prince St., Sydney, “4
N.S., is a firm composed of threé brothers, namely + Joseph J, a
KHATTAR (President), Simon J, KHATTAR, Q.C., and George KHATTAR, 4

It is mainly involved in the real estate and mortgage brokerage a.
‘business. The montgage brokerage end ‘is the sele concern of | ae

Joseph J. KHATTAR, who operates on the basis of a “standby fee™ |
plus a percentage (usually 3%) if he locates a favorable mortgage +
loan for his olients, -. “3

  
   

3-6 i. During the summer of 1963 Khattar's Realties Ltd.
learned that the Joyleand Shopping Center, Detroit, Michigan,
U.S.A., was up for sale ahd the firm (Khatter's Realties) ate
tempted to purchase same on its. own behalf, KHATTAR (reféring.
to Joseph John KHATTAR) was contacted by Roy BROWN and Leo COLE ~
of Roy BROWN and Associates, 20026 Greenfield, Detroit, Michigan, ;
who were handling the sale, end a price of $1,275,000 was agreed
upone In attempting to raise this amount of money KHATTAR con=
tacted one Gerald R,. SITTSER of H.A.S. Corp, (actual name of the
firm could not. be determined), 100 B. Waters Building, Grand © ;
Rapids, Michigan, who in turn advised KHATTAR that he had found
the required financing with First National Mortgage Company. 4
(KHATTAR maintained he never personally met SITTSER, being in 4
contact with him only vie telephone and mail), At this stage 4
Mr. Joseph Y. STEIN of First National Mortgage Company entered :
the picture and requested a' $5,000 retainer from KHATTAR on the 4
understanding that his firm would raise the $1,275,000 in sixty 4
days for the purchase of Joyland Shopping Center. The retainer 4

 

 

in form of a cheque.was paid in escrow to Roy H. BROWN and G.L.
SITTSER rather then First National Mortgage. (This action was
teken on the instructions of Simon J. KHATTAR, who acta as the.
legal adviser for Khattar's Realties). During the course of the |
sixty days period, STEIN made a trip to Sydney where he met the. F
| directors of Superior Concrete Products, Sydney, N.S., (who om= ;
an ploy Simon J, KHATTAR as légel counsel), who were interested in |
ocating a loan of $250,000 for the firm. STEIN told the directors!
that he probably could locate this amount of money for Superior }
Concrete but wanted a $7,500 retainer before any effort was made |
in this regard. On behalf of Superior Concrete, Simon J. KHATTAR. |
turned down STEIN'S offer unless he (STEIN) could produce a legal ;
registered commitment from a bonafide lender in the U.S.A. that {
-the money was available, :
; the $7,500 retainer.
