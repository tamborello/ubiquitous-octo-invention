: On March 15, 1962, CHARLES SAMS, United States Mail
Carrier, advised SA STEPHEN J, LABADIE that, although he had
carried mail to subject's residence at 2505 Bristol Avenue —
for the past five years, he had never seen subject. He states,
as a matter of interest, he hardly ever sees anyone at 2505 Bristol
Avenue, and has only been in contact with an individual he knows
as ANNIE MAE JACKSON, the colored maid, because he also delivers
mail. to her residence, 2505 DeLeon. He noted that even though
ANNIE MAE had been pleasant enough with him over several years,
she has never divulged any information concerning subject or his
residence. This source endeavored to locate subject at his
residence on March 15, 1962, and reported subject was not at his
residence, ,
