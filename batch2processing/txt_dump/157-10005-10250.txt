Mr. Sarno. Yes, sir.

Mr. Wides. And the program first operated where? Where
did you physically locate? Were you at the University of
Miami, at the Naval Air Station at the begining?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. Wides. Where were you at first?

Mr. Sarno. Are you speaking of our station? Our station
was physically at thef but these Cubans did not
know where the station was.

Mr. Wides. And you just contacted them separately?

Mr. Sarno. They had houses that they rented and they worke
out of different houses, and there were many of them, so I
can't recall them.

Mr. Wides. Did you have an office facility apart from the
station?

Mr. Sarno. Myself?

Mr. Wides. Yes.

Mr. Sarno. On one occasion, for a very short period, I

had an office.

Mr. Sarno. That was the station.

Mr. Wides. And what was the mission and purpose of
@UGIS, when you first started out, as indicated in the project
outline?

Mr. Sarno. Thsy were to collect intelligence on Cuba,
debrief refugees and provide bodies for any possible operations
i
required by the station.

Mr. Wides. They were to debrief refugees?

Mr. Sarno. Debrief refugees, collect and evaluate, maintain
records.

Mr. Wides. Was there a division of the members into

  

two groups, with only a small group involving the debriefing
of Cuban rafugees?

Mr. Sarno. Well, it wasn't too small a group, but if you
would speak of the whole organization overall, yes, it was a
small group.

Mr. Wides. And at -what point did you set up any cover.
apart from the station as a proprietary or notional company;
in between the AEG peovle and the Miami station? In other

words, were the companies prior to the Latin America GOGH --

  

jeatach, company that preceeded it, in time?
Mr. Sarno. In the time that I handled.them, which is
up to the 4AGER, I think there were three, three covers all

told, or perhaps four. I think we had our debriefing, you

know, under ona cover.

Mr. Wides. And what was their relationship to the Agency
through you? .

Mr. Sarno. They were. a group of Cuban exiles who were
being funded to collect information, intelligence information,
on Cuba.

Mr. Wides.. They were paid agents?

Mr. Sarno. They were paid agents.

Mr. Wides. Soma of them received a fairly sophisticated
training in tradecraft, in some cases communications{
operations with regard to a station in Florida, and so forth,
is that not correct?

Mr. Sarno. Sophisticated equipment, yes, sir.

Mr. Wides. And tradecraft, general tradecraft training?

Mr. Sarno. General tradecraft training, yes, sir.

' Communications.training -- well, most of them ‘weren't

communicators, so they required very little if they did
receive training.

Mr. Wides. Would that put them in a little bit more
official status of some sort, whataver the category is called,

than simply being a paid informant?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir. They were just like paid informants

except we provided them funds to operate with.
They are no more -~ they are not contract, we did net
have them under contract. ,

Mr. Wides. But they would still get training?

Mr. Wides. And except where there's a question of an
agent under cover who would be possibly exposed to harm or
that kind of thing in regard to the mention of other Agency
people, certainly at the level of Mr. Shackley or other
| officials, Mr. Dimmer, and so forth, that the general procedures
have been that people at the Agency or retirees have not
refused to disclose names.

Now, you certainly have your rights --

Mr. Sarno. No, sir. I am not questioning you, or anything
except I've been in this business a long time and I've never
mentioned anybody's name. Now if somebody were to tell me,
if Seymour Bolton were to tell me that I could tell you all the

names of all my supervisors and everything, it's perfectly all

 

right. But I've never mentioned a name and I feel that I
shouldn't mention a name. |

Mr. Wides. Well, we may have to take a break and do that,
but let me go on.

With regard to the igs’ program, the Eos Cubans were
not contract agents of the station, is that correct?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. Wides. They were proprietary employees essentially of

GED, essentially?

set up in September of 1968. Prior to that time they were a

bunch of Cubans just living down in Miami.

Mr. Wides. You never heard of any plots, nor of any
arrested people attemoting to shoot a bazooka when he was
giving a speech at Havana Stadium?

Mr. Sarno. No, sir.

Mr. Wides. Let me go to the period when you. went to
Florida.

When you first came here, that was before Station Chief
L__haa moved the whole station to Miami?

“2

Mrs Sarno. [wasn't there. When I arrived in Florida,

[Iwas not then -- no, sir, he was not the statdén chief.

Mr. Wides. Who was the station chief?

 

Mr. Sarno. I don't think I should give you his name.
I don't know. YOu have the rest of all of them, but I can't
recall --
I can state that there were two station chiefs between’

| and Shackley, three of them, in fact.

 

Mr. Wides. Shackley came in when, 1963?

Mr. Sarno. ‘62.

Mr. Wides. When in '62?

Mr. Sarno. I think the spring of '62 is when it was.

Mr. Wides. When was he replaced by Mr. Dimmer?

Mr. Sarno. If I am not mistaken, it was in '64, I think.
June, July, I think, something like that, of '64.

Mr. Wides. And then Mr. Dimmer was replaced in '66 by

Mr. Sarno. [

Mr. Wides. And then Mr. Esterline replaced Mr. i

 

or was there someone between?

Mr. Sarno. Mr. Esterline did not replace Mr. [kb
Nobody replaced [| because they closed up the station.

Mr. Wides. We understand that the station was operating
very recently.

“Mr. Sarno. Wkb1l, I'm not saying -- you see, the station
you spoke to before, you spoke of, went out of business in
June of 1960 when we.{ heee.

Mr. Wides. I see.

Now, what was the relationship between yourself and the
station? Administratively, and in tarms of reporting, when
you first went down there.

Mr. Sarno. When I first went down there, I was outside.
I believe it was concerning clearances to gat me into the
station, because I had never been working in a station before,
so there were special clearances. So at that time, those two
months you're speaking of, I attended a course and I may have
been sent out once or twice to interview a Cuban refugee or
one of our agents who had left Cuba.

Mr. Wides. And then you set up thef

 

you start that project; or was that started when you came in?
Mr. Sarno. It had been started, the nucleus had been

formed at that time.
