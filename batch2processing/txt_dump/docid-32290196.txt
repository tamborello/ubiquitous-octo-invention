of the weapons and silencers recovered in these murders were later { ..\--
found to have been purchased at the same gun shop in Miami, Florida. ae
In several of these murders, the victims were "hit" as they either en-
tered or left their vehicles. On two occasions, the cars had flat tires
and, as the victims stepped out of their vehicles, they were shot from
the rear. In two of the other slayings, the victims were killed in their
residences under closely related circumstances wherein the same number
of shots were fired to specific areas of the body and a mixture of different
types of ammunition was used in each murder, & strong possibility exists _
that two individuals are responsible for many of these murders and that 7
' orders for the "hits" were issued by ranking LCN functionaries. g
