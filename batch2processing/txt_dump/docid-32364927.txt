| MEMORANDUM FOR: Michael M. CHOADEN

|
SUBJECT : Foreign Divorce Decree

1. The purpose of this memorandum is to bring certain information
to your attention which relates to the fact that you and your current spouse
were parties to the dissolution in Mexico of former marriages. We under-
stand that some of the information provided below and in the attachment may
have already been brought to your attention, Nonetheless, we are taking this
opportunity to insure that no item of information was overlooked in earlier
discussions with you on this.

2. Recently, the Office of General Counsel completed a study of
; the validity of a Mexican divorce decree and potential problems arising
i from such a divorce for JKLANCE employees concerned and JKLANCE.

3. You will note from the attachment that the employee whose cur-

problems affecting eligibility for payment of various government benefits
such as reimbursement of hospitalization expenses, survivorship benefits

| therefore, is to be sure you are made aware of and understand the serious-
| ness of the problems which would arise in the event of a challenge to the
validity of the Mexican divorce and, consequently, to the validity of the
current marriage. This challenge could arise at any time and from a
number of sources.

4, JKLANCE has another interest stermming from Mexican divorces
and this is one of security, depending upon the employee's specific employ-
ment. In the event such a divorce is challenged, subsequent litigation and
attendant publicity become quite probable. It is, of course, in JKLANCE's
best interest that this sort of activity be avoided where possible,

5. Recognizing that there are various types of Mexican divorce, and
also that the various estates in the United States have decided cases in different
ways depending on the type of Mexican divorce involved and its own case law,
you may wish to discuss your personal situation with your attorney or a rep-
resentative of JKLANCE's Office of General Counsel. In the meantime, how-
ever, JKLANCE's position with respect to your situation is that it assumes

the validity of your current marriage, unless the earlier Mexican divorce
action and your current marriage are challenged. Should that challenge
ever occur, it may be necessary for JKLANCE to determine that your
eligibility for benefits based on your current marriage must be suspended
until such time as the challenge is litigated or otherwise resolved. Special
note should be taken of the fact that such a challenge might arise after your
death, possibly resulting in the distribution of insurance proceeds and other
death benefits to other than your immediate family as constituted at your
death and contrary to your own intentions and wishes.

tion with the above. If you have any questions on the substance of this
