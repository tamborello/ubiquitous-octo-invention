that the voice on the both of these recordings sounded Like
the anonymous caller who has previously contacted the
BENJOCHEA residence end he still believed that this is the

talked to the extortionist by telephone, expressed the
opinion that the voice sounds like that of GARCIGA, whom he
has talked to in person. :

+ On 1/22/65 the Miami Office cent ‘to the FBI
Laboratory typewritteh specimen. obtained on 1/15/65 by
MM 635+S, who went: to the, Abbey Clinic to consult Dr. BOSCH

this specimen on afis old Underwood typewriter. A non-
professional. comparison, of this specimen with the extortion

similarity, and it is hoped that this typerciter may be
identified as being the one used in the MENDOZA letter (gly 4 J
