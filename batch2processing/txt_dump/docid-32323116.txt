the group that the Latins were alone, the liberals in time of need
as well as labor deserted them. It was am illusion, he said, te.
believe the Negroes were with them, GARCIA cited the low percentage:
of Negroes that voted for HENRY B. GONZALEZ. He expressed dis-
appointment in Senator YARBOROUGH, Vice«President LYNDON JOHNSON. and
President KENNEDY whom the Latins had. helped a great. deal.. According
to GARCIA, it seemed all they got from them was. the "crumbs off the

PASO organization was needed. GARCIA was urged to bring this message
to the public, perhaps at the annual September 16th fiesta. GARCIA
said he was available for that night. JOE LANDIN and MARY LEE CASTRO
asked the local PASO chairman to arrange for GILBERT s appearance

at the 16th of September celebration.

; According to iaformant, tho meeting was originally
calied because it was believed that a liberal renegade was calling
a similar meeting to organize a local PASO chapter. This man, -
JIMMY TRUJILLO, former VIVA KENNEDY CLUB chairman, had already
organized a MAPA chapter and had received the chapter's charter.
He, however, did not really have any members in the chapter, and
has been inactive since he organized it. For that reason, @ j
LANDIN, J. ©. GARCIA and MEDRANO did mot want PASO to fall isto
TRUSILLO’s hands. GILBERT GARCIA assured them that the state and
national office would récognige then. ; :

Informant had no additional information.
