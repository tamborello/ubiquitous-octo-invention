%) "I was one of the fortunate group of individuals From
Canada]who were afforded the privilege of visiting your country . \
in Ocfober, 1966. !

"Perhaps you will not remember me, but I had the
pleasure of meeting you in Peking during our visit when you
and other membere of the Chinese People's Government greeted
and allowed us e yPportunity to present questions regarding
your country. een

"At that time, I expressed somc concern at, what
appeared to be, excesscs of the Cultural Revolution and wondered :
whether some of the people who had’ suffered violence and abusc i
at the hands of the Red Guards might not in fact be innocent. . :
Your reply was that as a result of over enthusiasm it was always i
possible to make mistakes, however, they would be recziReféad, :
in time . Gai{u) DN

"My purpose in writing is to express my concern and i
that conveyed to me by a friend from NY, SUE, a loyal Maoist, and i
acquaintance of yours, over the fact that recent reports havc :
indicated that long time friends of the Chinese People's Government,
ISRAEL EPSTEIN and. his wife and MICHAEL SHAPIRO had been arrcsted
for egpionage; SIDNEY RITTENBERG had been purged from his job with !
Radio Peking and ANNA LOUISE STRONG had been condemned as an !
"imperialist agent." We are deeply concerned rogarding the treat-
ment of these friends of the Chinese People's Government and
wonder whether the abuses which I previously mentioned are con-
tinuing in spite of your statement the mistakes would be rectified.
If these rumors are true a® ‘serious mistake has been made and we
appeal to you as a friend to intercede,on behalf of the friends |
of the Chinese People's Government .G& )

: letter or identifying SUE, for to o could conceivably disclose
