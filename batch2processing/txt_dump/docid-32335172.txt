HART advised ATKINSON he was expecting a man from
Orlando, Florida, to bring instructions. He stated the head
of the organization is-a retired General from the U. S.

Army and all members carry .410 gas guns. HART told him
they were to get a little club to carry that costs $25.00
and this club had a .410 ghell in each end. HARD has talked
to him about killing some judges and prominent people using
the crossbow as this could not be traced,

 

On 9/11/61 HART told AT 1655-C (RAC) that the Minute ae
Men Associates of Cleveland, Ohio, are a front for the Minute ae
Men and this organizations activities are not secret. He ne
said Minute Men Associates are hot the Hard core which is s-
a secret oganization. He indicated the purpose of the Minute
Men is to eliminate certain leaders or anyone, in fact, who

is standing in the way of returning this government to
constitutional government. He claimed the Minute Men had

a@ man who has been in the "rackets" and he has been selected

to fly to South America’: and bring back a rare deadly poison,
more deadly than curare, This poison will be used to eliminate
enemies of the Minute Men leaving no trace in the blood. 1
HAROLD A, ATKINSON advised HART has contacted him coneerning :
a meeting which was to be held sometime during the week of

11/6/61. He stated HART told him that he was being

considered as the person to be delegated to do away with one

of the palitical leaders in the Atlanta area. HART told him

it would either he him or another member to do the job. He

claimed ATKINSON would be well-paid for this task by the

Mayflower organization, HARD did not expand any further .
concerning this activity but stated he was not a member of the
Mayflower organization, It is noted the indices of the Atlanta
Division fails to reflect any reference for the Mayflower
organization, ATKINSON is associated with HART in attempting |
to sell subscriptions to the Metropolitan News er, Inc.,

a newspaper HART is allegedly attempting to organize. |
ATKINSON states HART does not have any presses and has been |
using the money obtained through subscriptions and the sale of 1
debentures to pay his personal bills. ATKINSON is of the

opinion the Metropolitan Newspaper, Inc., will never go

to press. He feels the Minute ten organization may just

be another scheme of HART's to gain money for his personal

benefit and that no such organization actually exists.

The only assignment given at the meeting was to
have Negro cemeteries checked as hiding places for concealed
arms. HART advised he had steel rods made to probe graves
of Negroes as the arms and ammunition are reportedly buried
approximately eighteen inches deep. HART said the Minute
Men must have arms and was in favor of a crossbow as it does
not make any noise.

HART informed AT 1655~C (RAC) on 8/14/61 that the
Minute Men are a group of men willing and able to do things.
He claimed the Minute Men had stopped integration in Miami,
Florida. He stated the Minute Men operate only in small
groups, never more than four men in a group, and the members
only knew the other members of his group. He claimed the
Minute ‘Men hold no meetings and have no meeting place. He i
mentioned a retired General or Colonel by the name of he -
and said he was ere of the directors, He said the organization fF oO
was nation-wide and their purpose is to fight Communism. He eo
claimed any members of the Minute Men who betrayed the organi- ay
gation would be killed. Initiation fee is $25.00 and dues are .
$12.00 per year.

On August 23, 1961, HART advised. AT 1655-C (RAC) :
that the Minute Men ‘had helped BUFORD SUTTON, former police !
officer, Macon, Ga., escape prosecution in Macon, Georgia. i
HART stated the hard core of this organization is the "Minute i
Men" and that"Minute Men Associates"are subordinate to them. ;
The address putting out the literature concerning the Minute
Men Associates is Minute Men Associates, 2850 East 117th Street,
Celveland 20, Ohlo.

On 9/1/61 AT 1655-C (RAC) talked with BILL ANDERSON, *
a member of the Nacirema and ANDERSON furnished the address of
the Minute Mer as 613 East Alton Street, Independence,
Missouri.

 

 

on 9/27/61 AT 1655-C contacted HART and J, T.
HENDERSON, Jonesboro, Georgia. HENDERSON directed them to
a Negro cemetery located in Clayton County and had them check
three graves with a steel rod. Two of the graves indicated
there was concrete two feet below the surface. HENDERSON was of
the opinion the graves contained arms which had been plxed
there by Negroes. AT 1655-C furnished the names of two persons
buried there. Recordés of the Bureau of Vital Statistics,

Since this time, HART has been interested in learning
all he can concerning the people who lite and work in the area
where this cemetery is located. On 9/25/61 HART advised he had
leArned from HENDERSON that about six men in &@ car with a car
Tennessee Tag and a pickup truck had brought one of the bodies to pe
the cemetery... HART claimed this made sense, since he had learned
from a member of the Minute Men that the burial of the arms was
supervised from Mount Eagle, Tennessee, J. T. HENDERSON has F
since indicated a desire to join the Minute Men and has furnished i
his $25.00 initiation fee, but as of this date has not been sworn Le
in. HART has indicated he would like AT 1655-c (RAC) to be his ot
deputy. HART furnished AT 1655-C (RAC) a letter with letterhead Kew
entitled "Minute Men Associates" 11808 Buckeye Road, Cleveland I

|

   

20, Ohio. The letter was dated July 27, 1961, and addressed to
Mr. KENT CURTNEY, Post Office Box 4254, New Orleans 18, Louisiana,
The letter was reportedly sent by LOUIS G. MARTON and makes
reference to a meeting held in Washington, D. C., on the 13th,
month not named, and sets forthihis reactions concerning the
meeting. The letter alleges all actions of the Supreme Court of
the U. S. have been null and void since 10/24/45 and the U. 3.

has had no legal Government of any kind since that time. The
letter urges the establishment of a "mighty, patriotic Army of te.
Minute Men" to restore to the U. S. its lost constitutional ‘
liberties and its national independence.

On 10/12/61 HART advised AT 1655-C (RAC) that he now
had in the Atlanta area approximately 57 groups. HART has told
the informant that a group of five men make up a unit but at
one time told the informant that they had as many as 25 men in
& group but that no more than five of these men met together.
HART claimed he felt he would soon get some sealed orders from
headquarters and claimed he had been given another state and would
have more to do. HART claimed he had not received any money for
expenses and hoped they would soon send him some as he was not a
rich man, HART indicated that they would soon have 20,000 to
30,000 inen.

HAROLD ATKINSON has advised that he had been designated
to work with Dr. COMPTON in searching grave yards for arms which
had been reportedly buried by the Negroes. He advised Dr. COMPTON
has always found excuses not to go and he doubts COMPTON is

| serious. He stated HART told him the Minute Men were made up of
groups never over four or five present at a meeting and these
meetings are being held all over the United States.
