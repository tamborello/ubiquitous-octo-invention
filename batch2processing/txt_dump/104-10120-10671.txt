Remarks:

 
 
   
    
  

In accordance with our conversation of this
morning, I forward Form 772 on Clare Boothe LUCE.

Since there already exist files on her both in

your office and CI/OA, and given her prominence,
I trust I shall not be required to fill in sections
5, 6, 7, 8 of attached--I hoped

Many thanks. RETURN TO CIA
