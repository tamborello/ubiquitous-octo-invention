Another who knows, or has known, Aline Mosby is former Agency employee
George Winters, #55769. Winters stated during an interview in Novenber/
December 1960; when discussing Americans in Moscow who lived beyond their
means, that newspaperman Harry Schapiro*was a very heavy loser at poker —
to the extent that "one got the impression he was on the Soviet budget."
Schapiro, he said, had a Russian wife who was more aggressive than he.
Winters added that newspaperwoman Aline Mosby was in Schapiro's office;
and commented that she "stuck mostly to the Foreign circuit rather than
the Embassy circuit." He said that she had been in the hospital on several
ocassions during the previous year, so that "one didn't gee too much of her":
and added that according to gossip one hospitalization was ocassioned by an
abortion. :

Another newspaperwoman in Moscow, whom Winters mentioned, was Priscilla
Johnson, #71589-DL. She has been mentioned in newspaper articles as one who
recalled having come in contact with Lee Harvey Oswald in Moscow, where she
interviewed (or talked) with him. Her name, Like Mosby's ,was listed in his
address book under her last name only.

Mosby was born on 27 July 1922 in Missoula, Montana; and greduated
from the University of Montana in 1943. She was employed by United Press
in Seattle, Washington, from 1943 to 1945, and was Hollywood Correspondent
for UP from 1945 to 1957. "according to the UP Bureau Manager at Los Angeles,
she resigned voluntarily in 1957 and her employment was satisfactory. Ace
cording to Confidential informant R-1, during an Agency investigation in the
fall of 1958, she was dropped by UP when she was subpoeaned in connection
with legal suits against Confidential Magazine, for which she had done re-
write work without the knowledge of UP. She went to the Brussels World Fair
as a stringer for the North American Newspaper Alliance. She was considered
loyal by her associates ‘during the above period; but was described as "the
co-existence type who associates with Russians" ("plays footsie with the
Russians"). No informant questioned her loyalty.

In January 1960, Mosby reportedly was introduced on the Dave Garroway
Show, “Today”, as NBC News' Correspondent; but in a State Department dis-
patch of 12 December 1960, which listed "Western Correspondents in Moscow",
she was named as representing UPI. .

According to HCUA records, Mosby did a motion picture critic type
article for the Daily Worker in 1947; wrote an article for the Daily Worker
at Laguna Beach, California, in 1949; and contributed a colum to the Daily
Worker on 23 November 1956. According to records of the Civil Service Com-
mission, the Daily Worker of 26 July 1957 and 29 August 1957 carried infor-
mation regarding her.
