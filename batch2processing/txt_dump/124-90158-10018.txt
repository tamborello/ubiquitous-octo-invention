will consult with CIA to determine the extent o heir
involvement in this operation.

 

Since the principal statute involved is under
U. S. Customs jurisdiction and Customs is currently conducting
invwstigation concerning HART, Miami feels no interview of
HART should be conducted as requested by State. It would
appear more appropriate that Customs should conduct such
interview at the proper time during the course of their
investigation; and UACB, no interview will be conducted.

Miami will continue to maintain close liaison
with Customs and will submit LHM, with copy to Customs
locally, following interviews of HOLNESS and HARRIS.

consulted prior to any interview of the subject in order
not to prematurely alert him to their investigation.

For the information of the Bureau, it would
appear the original information with regard to HART coming
to the U. S. to negotiate a $300,000 arms deal originated
with HART's contacts in Florida: JOSEPH EUGENS;HOLNESS in
West Pain Beaohela” STANLEY RRIS, in Jacksonville “4these
individuals attempted to sell information to the Guyanese
and Venezuelan governments concerning this alleged plot by
HART after reportedly having been bilked by HART, and CIA
is of the opinion this information originated with them.
Leads are presently outstanding for interview of HOLNESS
and HARRIS.

Previous interviews of HOLNESS, as set out in
Miami LHMs of August 27, 1969 and November 7, 1969 under the
HOLNESS caption developed information regarding HART's
attempts to purchase arms in Florida in 1969. These LHMs
are being disseminated locally to Customs for information
in its continuing investigation of HART. ees
