With reference to your Los Angeles report
dated 1 SEPT 67, attached hereto-is a copy of the application
d form submitted by Mrs. Gertrude ZAROWITZ dated 28 DEC 59 for =
: a Canadian Passport No. 4-953559 which was issued on 29 DEC 59.
Also attached is a copy of her application for renewal of the
-gaid passport. This renewal was issued on 9 MAR 65 and is ‘
valid until 29 DEC 69. \

 

2. The only method of determining if Gertrude
i ZAROWITZ travelled-to Europe during October 65 would be by
: ‘a physical examination of her passport as the Passport office
| : have no record of her travels. .
