HENRY GONZALEZ’ campaign manager. Before she had found this out,
MONA had explained to the.membership that anybody, any organization,
-who spoke out for peace would be red-baited ~ it was an. old trick,
and they had to decide whether to continue their good work or break
up. They had decided te continue. She stated the organization was
_ doing very well and they had publicized it in the local press/, by
radio. and had bought a large ad in the "OBSERVER." The publicity,
she said was costly and wondered if it was worth it. JOHN STANFORD
said it would be worth it if other cities would form similar peace
committees. Uu)

FRANK CASTILLO told the group of an ad in a Houston
newspaper urging the establishment of a Peace College. The ad was
paid for by JOE WEINGARTEN, a businessman. CASTILLO said. that if it
took a Peace College to have peace, he was for it. Y u)

Informant further determined that JOHN STANFORD read.a letter
he. had received from HARVEY O'CONNOR, President of the Emergency
Civil Liberties arid. former editor of the Oii Worker. O'CONNOR will
be in Texas from mid-January to March. He will stay at the Maverick
Ranch in Boerne, Texas. STANFORD reported he had contacted O'CONNOR
and had asked him what he charged as a speaker. O'CONNOR seemed
insulted, said he didn’t ask for pay, but felt proud to talk to people
on the BRADEN-WILKINSON cases. MONA SCHACHT added that her qrganiz
zation was trying to have the ACLU sponsor him as a speaker a)

It was decided the next meeting of the CP State Committee
will be in Houston on 4/15/62. The Dallas representatives will get
a room at a hotel there and they will meet one of the other CP
members on Sunday morning at 8 A.M. at the Greyhound Bus Statipn.
They will make arrangements to go to the meeting place. % ew U)

MISCELLANEOUS Zz

 

JOHN STANFORD, according to informant, read an article from L
either the September or December issue of POLITICAL AFFAIRS. The {
article was about the KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION. At a recent news
conference, JOHN STANFORD said, a ‘Texas editor had told the President
that what was needed in the office of the President was, not a weak.
sister, but a man on horseback who would tell Russia that the USA

,could annihilate her. KENNEDY pointed out that. there was a great -
difference between the editor and himself; that he (the President)
was responsible for millions of lives. KENNEDY, STANFORD continued,
had challenged the extreme rightists, but at the same time left the
door open for them with his cold war policy. 2 uw) ;

JOHN STANFORD, it was determined by informant, read a form
letter from the ACLU headquarters to its chapters in different cities.
The letter indicated that the ACLU, as it had told the Supreme. Court,
‘was against the outlawing of the CP. The letter gave some reasons '
for the ACLU's stand and added that while the organization was not. :
adequately prepared to take cases of individuals who would not register
as communists, their cases would be taken case by case. The letter
suggested the Supreme Court’s decision in outlawing the CP would cause. (|
several years of court litigation (to make the law clearer and | Ma
effective). It seemed that if nonregistering'.CP members were to be
arrested the law weuld have to be more explicit. ‘Another organization
‘had also made the statement that. it would take such cases. ° JOHN 12000

STANFORD gave them the name and address that the CP members could
contact if arrested for mot registering as CP members. That
‘organization is the Committee For Constitutional. Rights, 22 East
Street, Room 325, New York City, New York. These organizations,

he said; were not pro-communist.. A cownunist could not belong to them.

The ‘fact that these organizations had made such statements, ST. ‘ORD
added, was encouraging. He regarded it as a good sign. i) my

 

 

JOHN STANFORD said that it was a sure thing that a nation was
going to war when it outlawed the CP. He further stated that HITLER |
had proved that. Sommunists knew whem the imperialists are set on war,
and they exposed the imperialists’ war trends - the government knew
this and the result was the outlawing of the CP. flu

THEO CASTILLO denounced the bomb shelters as a hoax. He said
~they were constructed under the assumption that the blast would take
place a certain distance from it. If the bomb exploded in the
atmosphere, chances were its (shelter’s) occupants would suffocate.
CASTILLO called the construction of shelters a money making scheme.
MONA SCHACHT added that in addition to all of that, KENNEDY's consider-
ation of a bomb shelter program served to condition the American people
into believing war was inevitable. & Ok Wy) . ; ;

JOHN STANFORD suggested the group read a book put out by the

American Friends Committee. The book, "We Can’t Trust The Russians;'
proved that we could trust them. FRANK CASTILLO pointed out that some
folks he knew actually believed our A bombs were keeping the Russians
from attacking us. He had told them that Russia would never attack :
the USA first, JOHN STANFORD, stressing the importance of dis-
armament, saw the danger of a nuclear war being ignited by accident. ‘
JOE LANDIN added that the falling of a giant meteor could start a war. /
STANFORD said that the United States had used the bomb on people while
the Soviet Union had not. There was a contradiction, JOE LANDIN said,
‘in the U. S. policy on East Berlin. While President KENNEDY was willing |
to risk an ali out war over Tree access"in East Berlin, he was for—
getting the plight of millions of Negroes. who don't have "free access" to
public facilities in: the South. GU.) .

- At this time, STANFORD stopped the discussion to tell the group |
he favored following the national office's pattern of abolishing all CP
officers, as well as the State Committee. The group agreed. JOHN
STANFORD added that in the future they (former CP State Committee
members) would meet as interested obseryers of the critical political
developments of the present time. 2 Wy .

MONA SCHACHT, according to informant, reported she was working
with two committees, "WOMEN FOR PEACE” and the "COMMITTEE FOR PEACEFUL
ALTERNATIVES." She reported on her work in the latter organization. A
woman in the organization had started red-baiting and MONA thought she i
was referring to her. It turned out that the woman was referring to. .
someone else. She had “MARTIN” in mind, she said. MARTIN had a w
