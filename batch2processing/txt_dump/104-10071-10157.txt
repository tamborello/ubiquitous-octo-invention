3. Given the source of the above report, we view it with —
some reserve. In this connection, we noted the 19 Seotember
issue of L'UNITA, which reflected an article on KING's private
audience With Pope Paul held the preceding day. “According to
L'UNITA, immediately after the audience, in St. Peter's Square, —

KING Stated that “Ponoe Paul was most clear on the fact that both
he, personally, and the Catholic Church Support the cause of
civil rights". The article also states that in a press confer-
ence-held-at Fiumicino Airport after the audience KING said,
“The Pope will shortly make a public statement on racial seg~
regation™.- We have no other information at this time.
