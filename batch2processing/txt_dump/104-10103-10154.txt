On 29 Degember 1971 OLTMANG invited the Cultural Attache of the:

.- Russian: “Embassy KUZNETSOV for an evening in his house. The invit-~
ation was also for some other members of the Russian Representation.
_At the same time OLTMANS was to invite some six important journalists

KUZNETSOV. should ask OPALEV and IZWEKOV to come along with him. |

Vhe date agreed’ on originally was 11 January 1972. It then was

changed twice. When 14 January also wasn't suitable, it was. agreed

‘on 7 January to make the date for 18 January 1972 at 20.00 hrs.

From the invitation it. could only be infered that OLTMANS wanted

“to offer his guests an opportunity for an informal discussion.

* -Apout. the background. of the present good relations of OLTMANS with
the Soviet Representation | in The Netherlands, section Bois able to
: report the following: .

‘(This information’ comes from vulnerable source ~ OPPERBAAS. )

“4, In September. 1970 OLTMANS says with some surprise that he sudden~

ly received an invitation to a party at the Russian Embassy.
He: thinks it crazy; he doesn't belong to that club at all. But
‘his. thinking» is along the lines of those people. .

2. In October. 1970 OLTMANS appears. to be interested in an interview
" with KOSYGIN's son-in-law GVISHTANI who allegedly was connected
: with American-Russian ‘discussions about forming a mutual "“"think-
ing factory".
'. Presumably this: chad ‘some connection with the so called Club of
‘Rome in which GVISHIANT plays a role.
> Remark: GVISHIANI is chaixman of the state committee for science.
and technology and is suspected to be a highly placed
Intelligence Officer. — -.

3; Begining Narch 1970 OLTMANS contacted-the Press Attache OPALEV

from the Russian Embassy; OLTMANS would still like to have an
interview with GVISHTANI.

It would be.a filmed interview in which OLTMANS would cooperate
with the NOS. (TV).

In this period OPALEV's cooperation does not yet seem very .
extensive.

4, Thanks to the cooperation ‘of Aurelio PECCEI, chairman of the
Club of Rome, OLTMANS at the end of April 1971 succeeded’ in get-
ting in contact with GVISHIANI in Paris.
Also present at this discussion was the former member of the Russ:
Embassy FEDEROVSKY, now chief of protocol of the state committee
for science and technology.
