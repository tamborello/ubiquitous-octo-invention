LITEMPO/Precedure for Obtaining Mexican Transit Visas for Cubans

Department treatment of Cuban nationals, Under the new regulations, ell
Cuban requests for ontry vere referred to Gobernacidn in Mextee City. This
had the effeet. of prohibiting the legal entry of Cubans into México exept
after long delays endfor extra-legal payments to secure preferred attention.
Under the new regulations, a large backlog of requests built up, which has
costimed to increase to the presant time. This has developed inte a pare-
dise for the “coyotes” vho, for a price, use their "contacts" to secure pra-
ferred attention for their “elicnts",

of certain Cuben notionals, e special channel was set up in November, 1960,
through LITEWPO-1 and LETEMPO-2, which enabled us to secure entry permite.
‘The channel Ins been utiliced to seccure extensions of permits of Cubans
whose legal time of residenca expired, to arrange for change in residence
status, and to secure exit permits for legal departure of Cubans who had
entered México illegally. a

3. The majority of Cubano of interest to KUBARK vhosa requests ware
proceased through the project channel, came through Mextes in transit to the
U.S. With the granting of "visa waivers” by U.S. authorities, such Cubans
could be handled rapidly thravgh tha project chanel. {he channel. functioned
without difficulty witil May 1965, when the US Goverunent invalidated all
j visa waivers, Zbhis case at @ time when a muuber of authorizations had been
\ secured through the project channel, which hed not been acted upon by the
