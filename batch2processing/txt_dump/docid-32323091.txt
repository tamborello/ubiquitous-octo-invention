DL 100-8561

' PHIL there would be an organizational meeting of the workers for
GONZALEZ held on 1/30/61 at the Mexican Youth Center on North
Commerce Street, Ft. Worth, at 8:00 Pu. ;

HAROLD MANN suggested that all of the men of the group go
to this meeting but that each one is to go in the meéting along
and not in or as a member of a group. BAROLD said that GARCIA was
informed sometime ago by MARGARET CARTER of the Democratic Organi-
fog Committee (DOC), that he, MANN, was a. Communist and that Since
then GARCIA has shunned MANN. HAHOLD also said that he would not
like for the entire group to be bamned just because the group was
with him,

HAROLD MANN told EARLENE MARTIN to remain at home and
write poll tax receipts and encourage people to vote for GONZALEZ;
that the men would go to the meeting ‘and see if the party group
could be instrumental in the GONZALEZ campaign.

. BETTY MANN was a little undecided as to. whether she would
go the meeting but later decided to accompany HAROLD MANN, but she
and HAROLD would arrive about ten minutes after the meeting started.

The kter part of the meeting was devoted to discuesing
the possibilities of CAROLYN STANBURY's becoming a member of the
group.

. PHIL BARKER told the group that CAROLYN STANSBURY had
asked him if she could come back to one of the group meetings but
PHIL said that he has to discuss Marx's theory more and make sure
that she is ready. PHIL said that he is very doubtful that
CAROLYN STANSBURY will make a good Communist but he said. he never
turns down an opportunity to try to recruit someons into the CP
group. BARKER said that CAROLYN STANSBURY has a friend by the .
name of NAOMI who wants to come to a meeting with CAROLYN but that
she will definitely be refused until he can learn more about her.
PHIL said CAROLYN is now attending Arlington State College.

(DL-16--S has also reported the above CP meeting of 1/29/61.)
