to pay them for several weeks, thus incurring their wrath in the fy
form of a near-rebellion in approximately 1965. The drivers . ae
refused to work and gathered at the office of the firm to protest —

this failure to pay them. . .

 

The informant continued that NATARO, who was a member of the GAMBINO Voss
"family" of the LCN in New York, called upon several other LCN : :
members who were friends of his to assist him in this problem and

to protect the firm. BILL BONANNO was hanging around NATARO at

this time, his father having been kidnapped earlier, and BILL was
expected to assist NATARO in this difficulty. The informant advised
that he, the informant, became accidentally involved in NATARO's
defense dlso. He explained that he had arrived at the firm for note
the purpose of contacting HANK (LNU), an employee of NATARO and r
a hi-jacker, concerning a hi-jacking that had been planned. HANK 5
was to provide a driver for the stolen truck in this planned hi-

jacking. When the informant arrived, HANK told him about the +

situation, explaining there was about to be an explosion between.

NATARO and the drivers, and he asked the informant to help NATARO.

HANK gave the informant a gun which’ he placed in his waistband

and the informant joined HANK and several others in the parking

lot in front of the firm, where the crowd of dissident drivers

had gathered. JOE NATARO came out and addressed the rebellious

drivers, speaking softly and promising a partial payment to be made :
that same day and full payment within a few days. Due partly to

NATARO's persuasion and partly to the presence of his gunmen, the
drivers agreed to the settlement and went back to work. The informant
stressed that during this very ticklish situation, BILL BONANNO —
remained in the firm's offices and would not go out onto the lot
with NATARO and the others. The informant said this left a bad
taste in the mouths of many who were there or who subsequently
heard about the incident. :

 

 

In referring to HANK, the informant said he was not known at that
time to be a member of the LCN, but was very close to NATARO. He
handled hi-jacking for NATARO and, in fact, was sentenced'to a —
prison term in the AtlantaFederal Penitentiary for hi-jacking a
truck full of Vitalis hair oil. ,

 

     

While speaking of treachery on GENEVESE's part, the informant was
reminded of an incident involving the murder of FRANK "CHEECH"
SCALISE and his brother by ALBERT ANASTASIA just before the latter's.

The informant .dvised that GIAGGIO was the hidden owner of a bar
located on Second Avenue between 109th and 110th Streets in :
Manhattan. It is located one door off of 109th, on the west side.
of the street, next to a bakery shop.

A couple of years ago, according to the informant, there was a rash
of kidnappings in New York City of some LCN figures for ransom.

One night during this period, the informant was sitting in GIAGGIO's
bar when GIAGGIO came running in “scared stiff." He claimed that
two men in a car had tried to kidnap him and were outside. The
informant said he took out a knife and told GIAGGIO to get one

and follow him. As the informant emerged from the bar, he saw

two men standing by a parked car which fit the description GIAGGIO Lee
had provided. He asked GIAGGIO whether they were the ones and an
GIAGGIO, who was visibly nervous, replied in the negative and 4
hurried back into his bar. The informant said he learned later
that night from a witness to the attempted kidnapping that the two
men he had seen earlier actually had been the would-be kidnappers
after all. He surmised that GIAGGIO had failed to identify them
because he was afraid of a "beef." The informant said that the
GAMBINO "family!' of which GIAGGIO is a member, and the old BONANNO
"family" are referred to by members of the LUCHESE and GENEVESE
"families" as the "Pepsi Cola mobs." He said it was actions such
as the above on GIAGGIO's part that gave the GAMBINO and BONANNO
"families" a reputation of this nature.

 

The informant advised that HANK (LNU), the employee of NATARO, is
responsible for many hi-jackings in and around New York. He almost

never gets directly involved, but ‘makes the necessary arrangements.

On one occasion a few years ago, HANK arranged the hi-jacking of . vf
a truck allegedly full of bolts of material. He paid a Negro truck :
driver $300.00 to allow them to have his truck for four or five
hours. The Negro turned the truck over to "Pepi," an Italian
associate of HANK (not to be confused with an LCN member of the
same nickname previously identified by the informant), who took

it to a lot in Brooklyn used by the hi-jackers for exchanging

the stolen goods into a "safe" truck. They discovered at this
point that instead of the expected cargo, the truck contained .
Halloween costumes and decorations and some second-quality material.
"Pepi" took the truck to one of JOHNNY ANG's "drops" located in a
garage in a small town just north of New York City where ANG

paid him $2,700.00 for the entire truckload, an amount considerably
less than expected. "Pepi" is from the 12th: Street area in New
