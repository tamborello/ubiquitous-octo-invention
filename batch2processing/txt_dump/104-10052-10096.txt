DISPATCH

  

On 5 June 1963 Douglas J. FEINGLASS, Siaff Agent, arrived in

language conversations appearing on LIENVOY and LIFEAT lines. SAFARANO
departed PCS on 18 June thus freeing an inside slot for use by an operations -
officer, FEINGLASS' usefulness to the Station is handicapped by his inability
to transcribe the Spanish portion-of the reels from the Soviet coverage, This, .

he has settled into outside living conditions with a minimum of difficulty,
For the present, a monitor from the LIENVOY tap center is transcribing the
Spanish portion ofthe above take, There is a Station backlog of Soviet tapes
numbering about 50 which accumulated during the period when FEINGLASS
was trying unsuccessfully to transcribe the Spanish. The backlog is. being
retained until Orville HORSFALL arrives. . In addition to the Russian trans-
exiptions, FEINGLASS also clips the transcripts for individual dossiers thus
relieving the Station Case Officer for Soviet operations of a clerical task,
After the arrival of HORSFALL, the Mexico Station will review requirements
for outside translators and make recommendations for future use of.

4, Exploitation of LIENVOY information.

Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, and Soviet Embassies provided
details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and other useful CE data,
In most all cases of official travel, LIENVOY gave the Station advance
information when reservations were made, Confirmation of the travel is,
of course, obtained through the LIFIRE project. —

The traffic is reviewed for English speaking persons who might

be U.S, citizens making contact with Soviet or Soviet Satellite Embassies for
political or other reasons, On 20 May 1963 an English speaker identifying
himself as Albert Kennedy called the Soviet Embassy and requested political
asylum for himself, his wife and seven children, Subsequent investigation ~
revealed that he was also a protection case at the U.S, Embassy in Mexico,
Appropriate U.S, agencies were advised of Subject’s contact with the Soviet
Embassy,

effectively, As Headquarters is being advised by separate cable, the Mexico
Station does not plan to replace the present LIENVOY equipment until the next
Presidential candidate is named, assuming of course that this will occur within
the next few weeks,

  
    
   
  
 

8. Personnel.

On 17 June Robert B. RIGGS ‘resumed r meeting g Arnold AREHART and
routine case officer functions for LIENVOY, Gregory PARMUTH meets
Douglas J, FEINGLASS daily to deliver and receive the Soviet Embassy
traffic, PARMUTH's assistance in obtaining living quarters and necessary
sterile office furniture was responsible for the ease with which FEINGLASS
was able to settle into his outside staff. agent status, .

      
     
   
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
    

In the opinion of Thomas G. URQUHART, who has spent some time.
-inside the tap center, Arnold F, AREHART is doing a commendable job in
the management of the center, In addition, AREHART has a general aware-
ness of the take from each line. When leads of interest appear, he notifies
the Station immediately so that action can be taken,

Willard C, CURTIS contacts LIENVOY-2 when the Station desires
contact with the Mexicans directly or when AREHART is absent,

9, Production,

The volume of paper produced by this project is hardly reflected in
formal disseminations, operational cables, and dispatches which numbered
39 during June, The daily summaries, the transcripts from two Czech lines,
five Soviet lines, and five Cuban lines are retained for background use in
Station files. They could be more fully exploited for reporting purposes if
personnel were available,

_ There is attached a list of reports, cables and dispatches forwarded
to Headquarters during this month,
