DISPATCH

 

 

    

1. WOFIRM has been requested by an newspaper
editor (Attachment A) to release the Warren
$71 (CD 971 is Attachment B) which relates to
at the time of ASSESS INATION

sident Kennedy. Wis request was turned down. As you probably
know, there has been mounting public pressure to release classified
documents of the Warren Comemigsion. While no decision has been
made to declassify CD 971, it is highly possible we will be asked
te do so in the near future by National Archives, which bas
official custody of the documents, or by some higher authority.

2. Station is requested to_ discuss Paragraph -
One above with SQUIB/1 afterhis return to The SQUIB
service is mentioned in Paragraph 4 of CD and release of the
document is certain to provoke questions inf |. «= Since
CD 971 ig a U. S. Government document we need not (and should not) -
request SQUIB concurrence for release of the document. He should
be informed, however, that release ef CD 971 to the public domain
is presently under consideration; that the United States Navy
has no objections; and that we are giving him advance notice as
a@ matter of courtesy. Any views volunteered by SQUIB/1 regarding
this release should be reported promptly te Headquarters.
