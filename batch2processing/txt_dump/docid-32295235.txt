Re: EXPLOSION IN ENGINE ROOM
OF BRITISH FREIGHTER "GRANWOOD"

On May 20, 1968, Lieutenant Commander D. F. Smith,
U. S. Coast Guard, Mobile, Alabama, advised that he examined
: . the damage to the "Granwood” which was then dry-docked
' at Mobile, Alabama. Commander: Smith advised that the damage °
appeared to he caused by an explosion from outside the
ship near a grate through which water was being pumped
to cool the engines. He stated that the explosion was
definitely from outside the ship and was of such force to :
raise the deck of the engine room approximately four inches,”

The "Miami News" of June 1, 1968, carried an .
article which stated, “Cuban Power, an exile terrorist i
organization based in Miami, claimed today it was responsible
for bombing a Japanese freighter yesterday at a Tampa dock,
and a British ship off Key West.

 

"A spokesman identified only as Ernesto, added
that ‘other ships are going to explode.’ He said Cuban
Power iS warring against trade with Cuba,”

The basis for this article was a telephone call
received by the Associated Press at Miami, Florida, from
an individual who identified himselt only as “Ernesto of
Cuban Power."

Investigation has failed to develop any suspects
in connection with this matter and investigation is con-
tinuing by this organization in an effort to attempt to
identify any suspects in connection with this bombing and
to determine the validity of the claim by "Cuban Power" at
Miami that it was responsible for the bombing.
