COUNTRY: CUEA
SUBJECT: Politicr

’

1. AS soon as f arrived at the Hotel Conelia in San Juan, P.Rey
T received a visit from ''anolo PAY. The visit lasted 3 hours, The
conversatian wes lonp end dealt with Cuban matters as well aa the
affairs of the allied, western nations led by the United States of
America. .He shewed hie adniration and synupathy towards the person
and.the politics of the younp President. FAY considers the removal
of the missiles from Cuba a creat victory over Moscow and as a halt
to the communist advance under the hvpocritica) propaganda of peace.

2. With specific reference to that which pertains to Cuba, he
feals that thanks to the "firm, enerretic, and realistic" position
of the President, the United States has lent a great service to the

Cuban cause.

3. About the expected invasion which he saw core near, he could.
not, like all ‘Cubans, refrain from "“supportine it and be lad of it,"
and he says, even when said invasion fell throupl: beacause of realistic,
political compromises of the President; the U.S. has rade it pessible
for world opinion to realize what Tidal CASTRO represents today. CASTRO
4e nothing more than a puppet of the Kremlin who has hanced over his
country completely to Pussia. As for the opinion within Cuba, RAY
believes it to be “highly productive,” since those who could atill
possibly be in doubts have been piven the opportunity, thanks to the
emergetic American position, to learn the whole truth of the situation,
Thus, it terminated the ryth created in Cuba by FIDEL that Pussia vould
go to war in defense of his revolution. .

.&, As for the position of PAY toward the "Company", he is interested

_ dn getting along well with that orpanizaticn. He told mer . "What does
one gain by having a controversy with them? That dees net solve any

problem, and this haa always been mvy-opinion, from the tersinnins of the
fight. So much 80, he continued, that he has been Interviewed by all
the agenta sent to him by that orpanization, and "I pave the preef. when
I had just left the Ministry of Public verks over there_i bout June

6. Upon my askine him for his opinien on putcing Pardo LLADA in
front of a nicrophone talking to Cuba, he locked «t me in surprise.
Later, suiling, he said, "It would certainiy do FIDEL a preat deal of

harm.”

7. On the 30th of April, at the wedding of Ema CASTRO, I notified
RAY, with great caution (because the °-2 did not take its eyes off us
for se moment) that FIDEL already had the proofs that RAY, Faustino
PEREZ, and David SALVADOR were consriring. They were riving them enough
repe in order to catch them more easily. “They will not have the nerve,”
PAY answered me. "They have the nerve for everything and don't forget
that ever," was my reply. JI am citing this conversation in order to
show you the vigilance that already oxisted in those days on Manolo RAY.

8. ‘T learned that they slready had said proofs, throurh an intimate
girl friend of Raul CASTRC whom I had known from the berinning of the
Revolution. It is an intervicw, that I rememLer well, but IT cannot
remember her naine. Besides, she shoved me a larpe hlack pocketbook fn
which she was carrying the docurentarv proof. I understood then that
§t was the G-2. I did not see her again after that date,
