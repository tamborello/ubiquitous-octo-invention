This is in reference to your memorandum to the Attorney General of ff
August 17, 1967, regarding Carlos Martello. Specifically, you state your ;
| belief that Marcello should be brought to trial at jthe earliest possible date

   

As you are aware, Special Agent Collins was assaulted by Marcello iJ
on September 30, 1966, and one week later, on October 7, 1966, the matter was
presented to a grand jury in New Orleans and an indictment was returned.

Thereafter, on Novenber 9, 1966, Marcello was arraigned and plead
not guilty. Subsequent thereto, on December 19, 1966, Marcello's attorney,
Jack Wasserman of Washington, D. C., filed numerous pre-trial motions, includ-
ing one to dismiss the indictment on the basis that the grand jury was impyop-
erly impanelled within the purview of Rabinowitz v. United States, 38 Fo 2g
3h (5th Cir. 1966). s

"

. This office, and that of the United Stetes Attorney in New oo ’
reached the legal conclusion that Wasserman would very probably prevail on™

the mtion. As a result, United States Attorney Louis C. LaCour personally,

held a series of conferences with the Court in New Orleans, whereupon.it was

agreed that a new system for the impanelling of grand and petit juriedvoufg

be instituted by the Clerk of Court. Ce.

A new system was initiated in early 1967 and by the latter part of
May, 1967, had progressed to the point where a new grand jury was impanelled.~
Very shortly thereafter, on June 1, 1967, the new grand jury returned @ super=
seding indictment in this matter. ‘the original indictment was dismiésed on
June 5, 1967. |

Wasserman, in turn, on June 28, 1967, filed numerous pre-trial
motions to the superseding indictment. We, in turn, noticed the motions for
hearing on August 4, 1967. Wasserman moved for a continuance based upon a
commitment in Hawaii in connection with a conference of the American Bar

‘\Association, As a result, the: ‘prestrial 753. are now noticed for hearing

I. think you will agree that we have, in fact, made every conceivable
effort to get this matter to trial at the earliest possible date.
