United States people. Q
The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C.§2107(Supp. -
V 1994) (the Act) (copy enclosed) was enacted by the United States Congress and signed into law by
President George Bush on October 26, 1992. The purpose of the Act is to preserve and maintain all

(Archives), for access to those individuals interested in the history surrounding the assassination of.

To achieve maximum disclosure of assassination records, the Act established the JFK ,

charged with overseeing the identification and release of records related to the assassination from the
other Federal agencies. The FBI has assured the Board of our continued dedication of cooperating
with them to meet the objectives of the Act. In that spirit, the at eke
