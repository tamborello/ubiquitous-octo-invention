By ROBERT S. ALLEN and PA ‘SCOTT

The Central Intelligence Agency with-
ital i i tion from the
its investiga-

   
 
 
 

ine commission’s written re-
quest for all documents that might shed
lignt on the assassination, CIA. * authori-
.ties failed to turn over a naticnal intelli-
gence estimate warning that,it is Kremlin
policy to remove from public office by as-
s
onpose Soviet policies.

Titled ‘‘Soviet Strategic Executive Ac-
» the suppressed CIA document went
to the shocking details of how agents of
KGB, the Soviet sezret police, are trained
fo do. away with Western leaders, includ-
‘ing officials in the U.S., and to make their
deaths appear due to natural causes

One of the KGB’s nowly devised as-

 

 

  

 

sassination weapons is ‘‘a pneumatically _

cperated poison ice ‘atomizer,’ which
leaves no wound or other evidence of the
-of death.”

s deadly weapon has yet to be
used against any high Western official,
hundreds of KGB agents covertly operat=
ing outside of Russia’ have been supplied
with this pocket-size gun, awaiting only
orders from Moscow to use it.

HIGHLIGHTS OF the suppressed intel-
ligence estimate, which is locked in a se-
. curity areca within the tightly guarded CLA,
are as follows: .
; . “it has been reported that the KGB en-
i deavors to remove the threat to Soviet in-
terests posed by certain members of West-
ern governments, sometimes arranging
-for the issal of such persons from
public office, at other times even having
them ‘eliminated’ physically.
ch activities are known to be un-
rtaken against other types of persons in
the West, notably detectors from the
U.S.S.R. and from other countries of the
Soviet bloc.
» “One recently reported assassination
t technique is to electrocute an individual
by luring him to use a telephone, connect-
Ped toa “high: voltage wire, “during a thun-
derstorm.

     
    

  

   
        

 

   
   
 

 

volves the use of a pistol
son N ges in Jiquid or

“ its use. Nowtraceabie poisons h

ination Western officials who actively .

 

 

reported ich do not take efle
several hours after heing adininistcred,
thus allowing aa ‘assassin to be far from
the scene when his victim dies.

“A knowledgeable source has described

a pneumatically operated poison ice ‘atom-
izer’ which leaves no wound or other evi-
dence of the cause of death.”

Congressicnal investigators, who have

asked that the name of their coramittee be
withheld for security reasons, report that
CIA Director John McCone made no men-
tion of this explosive document in his sa-
cret testimony before the Warren Comriis-
sion. -
While McCone furnished the coramis-
sion with the CIA’s secret surveillance
reports on Lee Harvey Oswald’s eight

 

_in Mexico City before the. assassination,

including details of Oswald’s contact with
the head KGB agent in the Soviet erabas-

-sy there, the CIA chief gave no hint of -

the Kremlin’s assassination policy.

     

OTHER U.S. intelligence experts, very

dubious of Russia’s cocxistence line, stress

“that the Warren Commission’s findings

might have been different. if this.CIA esti-

mate and other documents suppressed by..
the State Department had been available

for study.

Congressional investigators also have
been sincked to discover that the CLA’s
assassi

While FBI officials warned Speaker

McCormack, a dedicated anti-Communist,
that he is on the list of Western officials
feared by the Kremlin, no CfA authority

 

  

has shown the No, 2 man in government:

the CIA report listing these secret Soviet
assassination methods.

Instead, McCormack learned ab ut the’

 

report only recently from co

probers who are trying to determine why -

the document has been suppressed. ‘

The investigators also are trying to de-:
termine why the CIA in its pre-assassina- -

tion report to the State Department on
Oswald’s trip to Mexico City gave details

only of the dcfector’s visit to the Russian”

  

embassy and not the Cuban emb
CIA did not report the latter visit
after r_Kennedy’s assination in Dallas
