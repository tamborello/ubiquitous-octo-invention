Case ID #: 62A-HQ-1029205
Title: JFK Task Force

Synopsis: For administrative purposes, Legat Mexico City
considers this matter covered; it will reopen upon receiving
further instructions from FBIHQ.

Administrative: Reference 3/4/96 telcon betweeen Carlos H.
Fernandez, Legat Mexico City, and Carol L. Keeley, JFK Task
Force, FBIHQ.

Details: In referenced conversation, Mexico City advised that
Mexico City was considering sending official correspondence to
Mexican authorities requesting their input on the release of
certain documents related to the JFK assassination. As Mexican
authorities have not responded to Legat Mexico City's first
request, this correspondence would be a second request to the
Mexican authorities.

In referenced conversation, Mexico City was advised
that the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) was
considering a procedure for handling notification/requests
overseas. Mexico City was advised that in view of this, Legat
Mexico City should withhold sending correspondence to Mexican
authorities until such time that FBIHQ obtains guidance from the
ARRB on the handling of such matters.

In view of the above, Mexico City is considering this
matter covered. lLegat Mexico City acknowledges this is still a
pending matter at FBIHQ, but for file administration purposes,
considers it covered in Mexico City. Mexico City will reopen
