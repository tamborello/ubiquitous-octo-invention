and GALILEO, BRUNO strongly recommended the name of John's
Vending Company, 29th and Mc Kean Streets, Philadelphia, as
the company to handle the distribution of the machines in that
area, and he further indicated that he would hope to control
the distribution in the Miami area through his "cousin. COLOMBO
did not appear to take an active 'part in the conversation at
this meeting and after the meeting ended, informant and

his extreme displeasure about meeting such individuals as
BRUNO and COLOMBO in public and indicated that he was strongly
resentful of contacting such individuals, and that this was
