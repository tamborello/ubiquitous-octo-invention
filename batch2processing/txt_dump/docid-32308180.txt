- expenditures of DEL PINO and DAVIDSON was learned by him

WFO 105-30037

The informant was scheduled ‘to Peer WDC by
air at 11:30 p.m., 4-20-59, for Miami. He returned to
Miami at the request of DEL PINO and said his only ,
immediate instructions from DEL PINO were to arrange for
about 20 minutes radio time in Miami. Informant said
DEL PINO has indicated he desires informant to continue
working for him. Informant said hée was told by DAVIDSON
that DEL PINO was flying to NYC from WDC sometime between
5:30 p.m., and 6:30 p.m,, 4-20-59, The informant was
unable to verify this as he had not seen DEL PINO at
the time he was last contacted by WFO.

The informant said DAVIDSON advised him that he
could possibly throw some business to the informant's

aviation business indicating there would be no mznifest

‘and it would be night flying but he understood that

informant was not afraid of such work. Informant said
DAVIDSON was not more specific, but he would immediately
report any additional contacts by DAVIDSON.

Informant said DEL PINO wrote the letter to
FIDEL CASTRO in informant's hotel room and then asked .
informant to deliver it to CASTRO'’s aide, Capt. LLANES
PELETIER (ph) at the Cuban Embassy. Informant said he
questioned this action, but DEL PINO assured him they ‘
would never do anything at the Embassy so he delivered the
letter. He said he could not get ahold of PELETIER, but
was taken to PELETIER's lieutenant (not further identified)
and ended up talking to four men who took him to a back
room and threatered him but took no action against him. “
Informant said when He told DEL PINO of this DEL PINO . :
was surprised they had taken such action, but added that
only went to prove what type of peeple they « -e. The
member of CASTRO's’ party who was most angered at informant’s
presence at the Embassy and who came out of the Embassy to
"get" informant after informant left there was identified — :
by a Department of State security man as Sgt. MANUEL ROJAS.
Informant was instructed to discuss this matter with his
contact at the Miami Office before he took any additional
step to contact any pro-CASTRO persons. - : . |

expense sheet for DEL PINO's visit in WDC. Informant,
could not further identify HELEN and said he had met
no one by that name around DAVIDSON's office.

“As a result of the disturbance caused by
informant's visit to the Embassy of Cuba on 4-19-59, the
MPD detail assigned to the CASTRO party picked up
DEL PINO and informant on 4-20-59, when they arrived
in the area of the National Press Building, WDC, where
CASTRO was to attend a luncheon. DEL PINO and informant
were merely asked to remain in an MPD cruiser where they
could not be seen by the CASTRO ‘party ‘and they did so
without hesitation or argument.

A review of the information furnished by
informant and the information relative to captioned case
in WFO indicates the only matter presently outstanding
is to identify the New York telephone number called from
the office of DAVIDSON, at which number "DON LUIS" was
contacted, This matter is being giver expeditious
attention and upon receipt of this information, this

-matter will be RUC'd to Miami.

The attached letterhead memo is classified
"confidential" since the information contained therein
might tend te identify an informant of continuing value
and compromise the future effectiveness thereof,
