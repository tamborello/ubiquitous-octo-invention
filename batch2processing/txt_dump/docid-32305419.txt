Outstanding Bureau instructions captioned matter
requires daily teletype. Loa

Currently Philadelphia receives on a continuing and
almost daily basis highly sensitive information from PH 591-C*,
PH 623-C*, and PH 614-C-TE, Information from these sources
is of such a nature that it requires the Philadelphia Division
to send alygst daily encoded teletypes. Frequently information
received was furnished auxiliary offices particularly the
Miami and Newark Divisions thereby causing considerable time
to encode and uncode these messages.

It is felt that it would be both economical and more

rather than teletype in this matter.

secure to handle communications as a daily summary airtel pa

It is requested Bureau authority be granted to submit
daily summary airtels rather than teletypes for the above-
outlined reasons, ;
