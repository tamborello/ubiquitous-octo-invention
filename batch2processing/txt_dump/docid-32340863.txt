Memorandum for A. H. Belmont
Rez MM 635-8
(Juan Fernandez de Castro Rodriguez}

134-5091

By cable 9/3/59 Legal Attache, Havana, was alerted to
possibility informant may have been arrested and was told to
furnish any data received but to make no open inquiry which might
jeopardize informant or compromise Legal Attache himself. Legal
Attache cable 7/6/59 advised no data received.

‘ Miami teletype 7/8/59 advises of call from "McFarlane"
(whose identity is unknoun but who is apparently acquainted with
informant) who said he had message from uncle of informant to
effect "Joe is still behind bars." "Joe" is code name of informant
and it would appear informant Is definitely under arrest by Castro
Government.

Although informant is probably under arrest, it seems
clear he has not revealed his relationship with FBI as we would
probably have heard a loud blast from Castro by now Informant
recognized his precarious position in acting as informant and
presumably he will not reveal his cooperation with FBI although
there is no guarantee what any man will do under pressure of
interrogation or in fear of his life. Presumably, he would not
do so except under most extreme circumstances for it would only
aggravate his predicament. Obviously, his present arrest stems
from his alignment with Cuban Air Force rather than his informant
status. He entered Cuban Air Force on his oum initiative and
recognized dangers of alignment with Diaz brothers. Fact that he
was in Cuba and working with us wis risk he assumed and we, in
turn, had to assume risk of exposure Or loss in return for valuan!+
data on a critical situations :

It is not believed we can or should do anything ut this
time to intercede for him. Such intercession would only
compromise him and aggravate situation for hime If we are later
faced with charges by Castro or inquiries from press that he
admits working with FBI, we are simply going to have to withhols
comment as to confirm it would not help him or us. At same time
he has been trustworthy informant and we should assist if
opportunity presents itself and if it can be done without
jeopardizing Legal Attache operation. For example, if Fernand«:.
should get free on bond, escapes, or charges are dismissed and fe
seeks assistance of Legal Attache in coming to U.Se, it is believed
we should examine circumstances at that time and decide what, if
anything, can reasonably be doneéo
