The survey also reflected ROSENTHAL had a PBX
set up in his closet and a one-way mirror located in his
living room. Several holes were also observed in the
ceiling of the apartment, which led this expert to believe
that line had been dropped from apartment #318 for the
use of ROSENTHAL. Info stated apartment #318 is
presently occupied by SpiAROKOL,
salesman, :

 

Another observation made by the telephone expert:
was that due to the extra wiring which they found in the
frame room at the Beaux Gardens Apartments (which is
located across the. hall from ROSENTHAL's former apartment),
ROSENTHAL could have had access to.any telephone line at

' the Beaux Gardens Apartments. ;

Informant said that on Sunday, 6/21/64, a middle-aged,
rather husky Negro male was stopped in the 8000 building of the

ROSENTHAL). Th individual told the informant that he wanted
to see CHARLEB/WHITE (a former occupant of an. apartment at the
Beaux Gardens Apartments). This individual was later identified
by the North Bay Village-Police,—according to the informant,
as JOHNIE E<AKOBERTS, ‘who resides at 780 Northwest. 47th _
