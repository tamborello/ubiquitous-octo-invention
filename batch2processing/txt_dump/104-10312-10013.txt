additional information about Novel by writing to a friend of hers,
Mr. Aaron M. Kohn, who ia the managing director of the
Metropolitan Crime Commission in New Orleans. She asked whether
there was any objection to her doing so. She was told that there
was no objection as long as her inquiry was couched within the
frame of reference of her own business and had nothing to do with
CIA. She then penned a note to-Mr. Kohn, inquiring about Novel
as a customer of her service and read it aloud. She was assured
that there was no objection. She added that Mr. Kohn had done fine
jobs of cleaning up firet Denver, then New Orleans. (Comment:

‘ Kohn is a firm antagonist of Garrison.) Miss |cautioned
that she may not get a reply for several weeke. ée will give CIA
any information about Novel that Kohn may provide.

 

13. Novel's motives remain obscure, As was reported earlier,
there is a clear possibility that he rernained an ally of Garrison
after their seeming antagonism developed. If so, his efforts to Link
himself publicly with CIA could be part of Garrison's attack upon
the Agency. This theory would algo explain Novel's relationship to a
Garrison crony like Willard Robertson. Another possibility is that
the feud is genuine. (Novel has made very strong accusations against
Garrison in major radio broadcasts; these include charges of
occasional homosexuality and possible direct involvement in the
alleged murder of David Ferrie.) Mied| formed a clear
impression that Novel's dislike of Garridéni is génuine. If so, hie
' persistent attempts to ink himeelf to CIA may be part of a campaign
to create for International Dynamics Corporation an aura of prestige
as a result of supposed ties to the federal aovernment. He Heted the
U.S. government with “he one of his clients. His
relationship to Willard Robertson might then be explained by his
repeated assertion that he has a penetration in Garrison's entourage.
