8 Mr. DANTELS advised that he did question ALEXANDRIA
as to whether or not she had mentioned his narce i: anyone.
9, Ni, therefore, appears that the events which have
taken place have been confirmed. The degree of security implication
cannot be presently determined. In other words. ALEXANDRIA's
discussions with personalities unknown reaarding June CCBB
is a big question. The poesibilities of ALEXANDRIA's discussions
with Cubon nationals is most likely since she is in contact with
reany of them in the New York area.

expects to depart New York City for San Diego during the week = -.-... .
of 24 Cetober. It appears that she plans to make a permanent
chenge in her residence, Mr. DANIELS further advised that
he did obtain employment for ALEXANDRIA in Medico but that
H she had resiqned from this position during the week 17 October.
