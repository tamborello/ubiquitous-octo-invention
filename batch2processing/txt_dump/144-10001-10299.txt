[w.] In the first place, I would like to receive the instructions
requested in my telex of 1500 hours. Then, according to
what you say, permit me to make some suggestions regarding
the statement which the President of the Republic will
surely make. i

(s.] First, let me say that as soon as we learned the! tragic news,
the President of the Republic, accompanied by the Foreign
Minister and the Minister of the Interior, visited the
United States Ambassador to express the grief ‘and sorrow

, of the government and people of Chile. The President has
sent a cablegram to Mrs. KENNEDY and to the new President
of the United States, expressing his condolences. Also,
the Foreign Minister has sent a similar cablegram to the
Secretary of State. National mourning has béen decreed
for three days. The President has already made a statement
which in a few moments will be given to the press and which
I shall send to you. Likewise, the Foreign Minister will
make a statement. As far as instructions, while they are
being prepared, it seems necessary and indispensable that
you proceed to express to the United States ‘Government the
condolences of our government and our peoplé, in the fol-
lowing manner: Real consternation reigns here, because
President KENNEDY was loved and admired by the people of
Chile, who knew that he always understood our problems.

The text of the President's statement reads as follows:
"In the face of the unexpected and tragic news of the -
death of the President of the United Statés of America,
Mr. JOHN F. KENNEDY, the President of Chile is convinced
that in expressing his profound and innermost sorrow, he
also speaks for the sentiments of all Chileans,
"President KENNEDY gave the world a new concept of peace,
of justice, of liberty and of democracy. His idealistic
and constructive concepts were, in the field of action,
becoming realities which have come to signify for the
people the hope of a more just and more free tomorrow,
"His tragic death is not only mourned by the sister
republic of the United States of America, [t is the
whole world, which in these hours feels the sorrow of
an irreparable loss, Chile shares, fully, this grief
because she found in him profound eémprehension of her
problems and a spirit always determined to help us.
"Santiago, 22 November 1963,"

Please make the suggestions you feel advisable as you
announced above,

iW! Because cf the present situation in Washington and the
prevalent atmosphere in Congress in respect to the
foreign aid program, particularly in respect to the
Alliance for Progress, to which I have referred at length
in previous cablegrams and notes, I think that the tragic
death of President KENNEDY should not pass without very
explicit reference to said program, of which he was the
creator and the most ardent defender, even to the point
that there were times when the maintenance of the
Alliance in American circles was entrusted almost ex-
clusively to the personal battle that he maintained on
all oppesing fronts. For this reason, I am suggesting,
knowing that it would be very well received in circles

of the Administration of the United States, that in
President ALESSANDRI’s statement a very special ref-
erence be made to the President as author and struggling
defender of the Alliance, pointing out the urgent neces-
sity for the United States and all the Latin American

peoples to make of the Alliance, that is of its.’ wenlities,
a "living monument" to the life and concepts ¢ of this great
man, This is my suggestion,

‘[s.] At this moment, we are seeing whether or not Che President 's
statement has already been released to ehe press, in order
to be able to make an addition.

The statement has already been released to’ ‘the press as we
have transcribed it to you. However, we will make use of
any further declaration to take your suggestion into
account. :

[w.] The declaration that will be reproduced by all the news-
papers of the [xG] since probably later declarations will
be confused under the deluge of important reactions from
many sources. I ask, finally, if it would still not be
possible to send the newspapers’ an additional paragraph to
the statement already sent, having in mind that if the
President's statement has just been sent, it could not be
actually published yet but would be in the morning news-
papers tomorrow. The same step should be taken in ref-
erence to the texts sent to the wire services.

[s.] Unfortunately, the statement previously mentioned has already

been transmitted by radio; therefore, it is impossible to
make any changes, ‘
