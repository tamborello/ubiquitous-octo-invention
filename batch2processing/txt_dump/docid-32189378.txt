The evening newspaper, “le Monde", reveals that a-
new mystery has arisen in the investigation OZ the assassina+ oy
tion of President KENNEDY, aS if Showed that certain :
reproductions ef a photograph in which LEE HARVEY OSWAID \
held “the murder weapon” were falsified. ‘

The daily refers te an extensive Study made by the
French weekly, “les Cahiers Du Centre D'Etudes Secialistes" .
‘(Notebooks of the Center of Socialist Studies), concerning
three photegraphs inserted in different publications, in
which the presumed assassin of KENNEDY appears with a gun
in hand and a revolver at his waist, revealing that
"davestigations made on these have shown that the photographs
were modified."

Then, “Ile Monde" recalls that after the aseassinatica,
the Dallas police hastened to communicate to tha press
reports "on a degen preofs", among them a photo of OSWALD
with the two weapons.

And it adds: ‘Tho phote published by the weekly
