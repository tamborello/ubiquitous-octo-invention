“ Enclosed herewith are two Xerox reproductions of. the

Mexico City file copies of Mr. CHARLES THOMAS‘ memorandum dated
12/10/65, and the memoranda from this office to the Ambassador
dated 12/27/65 and 2/23/66 JZ

Background
ues fsnno DE; {paz, or Miss GARRO as Mr. THOMAS calls
her, is a well Mnown figpre in Mexican political, social and

literary circles. She was a playwright and well known to many
:,, fefficials of the Embassy including the then Ambassador. FULTON
,FREEMAN, the then Deputy Chief of Mission CLARENCE A./BOONSTRA,
{and many others. All of those officials expressed tg'me on
various occasions the opinion that Miss GARRO is a véry interesti:
person and a scintillating conversationalist, but that she has a
vivid imagination and frequently appears to be unable to distingu:
between truth and fiction. Although interesting, they all conside
=eher as highly unreliable as a source of information except for
Mr. THOMAS who apparently placed consistent credence in what Miss
GARRO said

 

When Miss GARRO visited this office in November 1964, sl
nA claimed that she had seen LEE HARVEY OSWALD at a party given at
~ the home of RUBEN‘DURAN on September 30, October 1, or October 2,
1963 ,as reported ih Mexico City letterhead memorandum of 12/11/64
go As pre iouply reported, Miss GARRO claimed that her daughter,
ELENA AZ ‘GARRO, who accompanied her at that party, met for the
/ first time, a young man later identified by her as ARIO ALEJANDRO.

who. acquired this intelligence information, I feel a. |

responsibility for seeing it through to its final evaluation.?!

It appears, therefore, that Mr. THOMAS Page wow decided that he
‘and not the FBI or the Department! Of PuBr ed is the one to

decide how the story given by MisS, GARRO) is to be evaluated.-

The concept that every person who passes on to another govern-

ment agency information relating to matters within the jurisdiction

of that agency has the responsibility and authority to review

and evaluate the action taken by that agency is, of course,

untenable.

Further question concerning Mr. THOMAS' judgment is
raiseafby item 3 of paragraph 10 of his memorandum furnished to.
the Secretary of State. Any reference to th Dd
relationship between the head of CIA Mexico WexTeer
officials, if true, is a very highly classified matter and any
"leak" or revelation to unauthorized individuals concerning such
an arrangement would, in view of the delicate Mexican political
Situation, be disastrous to the Mexican Government as well as --
to Mexican-American relations. The delicacy of the situation
has recently been greatly augmented by the published Cuban
allegation that one of the officers of the Mexican Embassy in
Havana was acting as a CIA spy with the knowledge of the (3

 

 

 

   

Government -& Mr. THOMAS, however, included such a highly
classified reference in a memorandum which he classified y
as "confidential", contrary to-regulations relative to classification -
of ‘documents. While this reference relates to the activities and
operations of another Government agency and therefore is not of
primary concern to the Bureau, it is nevertheless called to the
Bureau's attention for consideration in evaluating Mr. THOMAS'
current allegations. :

An additional copy of this letter is being forwarded
for use in the event the Bureau desires to forward a copy to
Dallas which received a copy of referenced letter ./¢
