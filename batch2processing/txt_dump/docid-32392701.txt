Action Required: For your information.

Reference: —HMMA-20052

“1. Background

The LIEMPTY Project is. designed to collect operational information
on the LIMERICK installation and personnel, as. well as selected targets of
opportunity through the use of stationary and .mobile photographic coverage,
In addition, the project provides means for investigating leads provided by
the above noted assets and supporting other Station operations through renting
of safehouses, providing and servicing PO box drops, conducting countersurveil-
lances, and other related tasks.

2. Operations

LIEMPTY provides the majority. of photos used by the Station in its
CE exploitation against the LIMERICK target. In this phase of the operation
tire LIEMPTY baschouses and phototruck produced approximately 122 rolls of oper-
ational photos for the Station's CE program. Selective examples of the
operational use of these photos and the support given to other Station
operations by LISMPTY assets are as follows:

a. LIEMPIY photos proved that one Paul SKUP (aka Saul SKUP) did visit —
the LIMERICK installation, This case was of interest to Headquarters
recently;

b, A LIEMPTY photo was utilized in identifying oné Adolphe Pierre
POFFET as a visitor to the LIMMERICK establishment on 17 August
1963. LIEMPTY also provided make and license plates of the car
uséd by POFFET at that time, This case is presently of interest
to ODENVY. :

ce. LIEMPTY ven provided’ photo evidence

CARDENAS, son of former Mexican president Lazaro CARDENA:
visited the LIMERICK installation for a period of four and one-
alf hours on 28 December 1963: -

 
 

a. In addition, (IEMPTY photos were instrumental in identifying
all arriving LIMERICK personnel - ineluding known and suspected
intelligence officers, plus documenting, the daily routine of all
personnel of the LIMERICK installation. : :

- 8, LIEMPTY/LIENTRAP has provided photos of interest to KUTUBE/D
of the LIMERICK installation ana is presently working on similar
coverage of the DMLET installation.

f£, .In the area of pretext investigations, Oliver G. SCANTLING performed
with excellence in a number of these. Among the more important
and revealing were. those conducted on Juan NAVES Ruiz and AEMIQUELET-

2 and 3 (this later in conjunction with Headquarters interest in
the case). . .

g. In support to other Station operations, Oliver G. SCANTLING has
peen acting aS alternate contact of LIEMIT-1 in @ sensitive LAURICLE
operation. The LIEMPTY cutouts (SCANTLING and GERENDE) also service

a number of P.O. Box drops used in Station operations . including

those related to GYROSE activities and the LINLWWCK operation. —

h. SCANTLING provided the cover correspondence for an SW mail channel
with EMLITEA-1 while the latter was on assignment to Santo Domingo.

3. Security

During the reporting period there have been no known adverse security
incidents affecting the LIEMPTY operation. Meetings petween the two cutouts
under the project (SCANTLING and GERENDE ) and the KUBARK Case officer, Jeremy L.
Niarcos, are made in a clandestine manner and meeting places and times are
changed frequently. Meetings between the cutouts and action agents are made

in a similar manner.

In order to provide maximum compartmentation between the various pase-
nouses, Oliver G. SCANTLING was inserted as the cutout to the LIMITED paser.ouse
-and.its basehouse keepers (LIEMPTY-6 and LIEMPTY~-8). in’ October 1962. He replaced Cc
Raymond H., GERENDE in this task. G8RENDE continues as cutout for the LIENtRAP —
LICALLA, and LILYRIC phase of LIEMPTY. In addition, this move makes for better

- rapport between the cutout and LIEMPTY-6, (since LIEMPTY-6 and SCANTLING are

close in age) and gives CERENDE time to provide more prompt processing of the

raw photo take, (In regard to this development, 4t should be noted that

GERENDE can now regularly provide finished product within 24 hours - sooner

upon request).

Ay Equipment

; No new equipment was purchased during, the reporting period nor is any
such purchase presently contemplated. Such repair to photo equipment as is
necessary can pe done locally without security implications.

5. personnel

No personnel changes were experienced during the reporting period

other than that noted in paragraph 3 above.
