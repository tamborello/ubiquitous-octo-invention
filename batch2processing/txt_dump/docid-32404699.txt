C)

In this, I absolutely nowhere, nowhere, made any mistake or lie.

As accounterintelligence officer, I think, you understand perfectly
that, having given (("said" - skazavshi)) one fact, a person must

say whence he knows this ((fact)), how this occurred....

Correct, correct.

Well, so you understand what ((‘'thus, as" _- tak kak)) I say ((to you)
but how does it turn out (a chto poluchayetsya)?

For example, this Paris case; I tell them what ((‘as" - kak)) I know.
"From where do I know ((this", they ask me))?

"Nonsense, nonsense" ((they say)).

( (Laughs) )

How do I know?

"But these fellows... from IONOV's section (otdeleniye) told me

((I say)).

"No, Not so" ((they reply)).

Well, I cannot say anything more.

I heard ((about this case)) only from then.

Or they supposed (predpolozhili) such a fact: From whom did I first
find out about DE JEAN?

So, believe me, believe me; I do not remember who ((was)) first, |
from where ((I)) first ((found out about this)).

First of all, working in the KGB -- here, if you please, is the
problem: they do not believe me ((when I say)) that rumors, gossip,
etc., pass (khodyat) among the workers there.

You have worked ((there)); you know, if you worked ((there)), how
it is: the First Department (otdel) has ((‘'makes" - delayet)) a
case, but 10 departments (otdel) know that the First department is
doing something, something, ((al though) ) they do not know exactly
((what it is)).

But friends, those who have friends in the First Department, they
know a little more: that, ahah! ((there is)) a case against an

American, but they do not know the name ((of the American)).

I think that in this respect they understood you perfectly, and I do
not think.... . :

((Interrupts)) "No," they tell me,"This cannot be.

What you are telling us is nonsense."
Not in all cases was ((this)) so stated -—= that....

((Interrupts)) And... believe me ~= well, how?

What kind of trust or distrust can ((there)) be, if they say to my
face: "You did not work in the First Section (otdel) of the First
Otdel ((auring)) these years"?

I cannot say anything.

True (pravil'no), in the ABIDIAN Case, I did not look very goog,
but I said so ((mysel£)), that I did not work on it, did not conduct
his development (razrabotka); the file was charged to me (delo za
mnoy chislilos') .s

But how was it run?

So they surveilled ((him)), waited for ABIDIAN to show his tail
(khvost).

They do not believe me.

Well, about this....

We still will return to the case of ABIDIAN.

I know everything that you have said about ABIDIAN and so forth;
and, of course, as a former employee of the KGB, I never in any way

can believe that you were the case officer for ABIDIAN,

I was not the case officer, I was deputy chief of the section....
The more so....

((Interrupts)) And they thrust the case upon me, but this was a

terrible mistake (("gross error" == grubaya oshibka)), a terrible
mistake of the department, because it ((is)) necessary to sit and

work on ((a)) case.

Well, if.... Earlier you said that ((yoltare)) prepared to discuss

stay abroad and not.return to the Soviet Union.

No one knew about this.

Well, anyway, I think you still have not completely understood what.

I said....
((Interrupts)) About what?

. About what I asked you.

What ("how" = kak) do you think?
that you were in such a position as you are now?

... As I understood -- the confusion of my explanations and....
Here, these moments, perhaps....

Then....

I do not know, I do not know.

I have, strictly speaking _ I cannot say why, why, what is the

reason (("main point" «= sut')).

‘I only know one thing -= that they do not believe me.

You yourself mentioned the word: "confusion of explanations"
(zaputannost' ob"yasneniy).
How do you explain this "confusion of explanations", if you see such

a "confusion of explanations"?

I do not see special....

((you)) see -- when I... and your colleagues who preceded you (s
predydyshchimi Vashimi kollegami) were talking together, even they
said to me: "This here is a lie (vot zdes' nepravdu); this here is
a lie”.

But the point is not in how I said ((it)) (A, ne v etom delo, kak ya
skazal).

I said that "I took part"... "I did not participate".

The point is in that this fact took place or did not take place.

B.

 

I am ready to answer all questions.

It is another affair that everything I say, everything, is understood
((is viewed or treated)) from the position that it is incorrect and
that I... so to speak, ((am)) false (fal'shiv) and came with a
definite assignment (opredelennoye zadaniye).

But how do you think -- since, so to speak, you yourself have

already raised this question: "They think that ((I am)) false, that

‘((I was)) sent with a definite assignment", etc. -= how can you

yourself answer: Why are you in such a position?

How can you explain this yourself?

Absolute distrust... absolute distrust, and then I already have
been thinking to myself very much ; it already ((has been)) a long
time (bol'shoy srok): 479 days today .

479 days -- this is neither ((479)) hours nor minutes....

Here ((there is)) quite simply the deliberate -= 80, perhaps, to
speak -- desire... the deliberate desire of the people (u lyudey):
to make a case that... "Well, here a double agent (dvoynik) sits -
before us". |

As if this were ((their)) aim, ((their)) task.

((It is)) not ((their)) aim-task (tsel' ~zadacha) actually to know

the truth; but ((instead, it is)) their aim-task to make such a case.

Well, speaking in a friendly way, how do you consider ((this)) as a
counterintelligence (kontrrazvedka) officer?

Do you think that all of the people | who worked with you have mis=
understood you, etc., so much. that -- without reason and without

any basis (osnovaniye) == they have held (("are holding" -- derzhat))-
you for more than 400 days?

As a counterintelligence officer, tell ((me)).

I can say only one thing: that I have said, I say, and I will say
until the end that I have conferred with absolutely no one; I have
not heard a single word from anyone regarding ((my)) travel (poyezdka}

here, ((and)) I shared with no one ((the thought)) that I want to

Reel # 1
26 July 1965

Following is the: complete translation of the verbatim transcript.
TRANSLATION

A. I think we will speak in Russian.

You do not object?

B. No.
On the contrary, better in. Russian, because in English I ((am))

no ‘so ((sure of)) myself...

A. Over the last three years, together with my colleagues whom you
already Know ‘and who ‘have: worked with you here -- ((those who))
questioned (doprashivali) ((you)), ((and those with whom)) you met

and became friendly, I also have taken an active part in your case.
B. Yes.
A. From the very beginning, as soon as your case had begun.
B, Unhunh (affirmation of. understanding)).

A. And, as you already have been told during the discussions and the
investigation, a large part of what you have said cannot be accepted
as true (za chistuyu monetu).

And one cannot accept that which you said in your statements
(pokazaniya), etc ,°in just the way that (tak kak) you said or
testified (rasskazyvali ili pokazyvali). —

I think, therefore, that you understand this perfectly.

But, as far as the people who worked with you, questioned you, and
met with you ((are concerned)), all of them to some degree speak
Russian--~ some well, some not so well _- ((but)) some de not know *
the Russian language at all; it is the same in your case (tozhe

samoye s Vashey storony): ‘although your English language is good,

bane

still -- quite understandably -- there are some expressions and
words which are difficult to understand.

And, as for as all of the persons who worked with you before this
((are concerned)), perhaps they do not know or understand Soviet

reality very well....
That is correct.

.. And therefore, perhaps, for them in some ((cases it was))....
((Interrupts)) Not understood what I am explaining.
Not wholly understood; perhaps it was understandable to them, but....
((interrupts)) But not in detail.

Not in detail.

I am here only for that reason -- in order to clear up all of

these misunderstandings which have arisen and existed.

I can tell you beforehand that at one time I worked in. the KGB, in
Moscow, and lived there.

And I think that we, as former colleagues and former Soviets, will
try to find a common language in our discussion and to clear up
everything that was not understandable to us and everything that
was not understandable to you. - ‘

If you have sufficient courage and understanding of what I will say,
I think that we will find a common language and finally we will
arrive at some common denominator; we will not leave a single
puzzling question which would not have been answered or incorrectly

interpreted.

I agree with you absolutely.

I am wholly at your disposal.

Could you be precise?
