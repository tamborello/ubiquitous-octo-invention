(C) In response to the AMWOLD follow-up questions posed by the AARB:
“Was part of the program to put in place a government in exile?
“Was there ever a government in exile?
i would offer the following as some suggested language.

(C) “Based on file reviews and recollections from officers involved in the Cuban program, there was never
a Cuban Government in Exile. During the planning for the Bay of Pigs operation it was envisaged that
after the invasion site had been secured, Miro Cardona and the Cuban Revolutionary Council would be
flown to the area to establish a new Cuban Government. The invasion site was never secured.

(C) "The AMWORLD Project, begun well after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion and after the release
of Manuel Artime Buesa and other Bay of Pigs veterans from Cuban prisons, was designed to support
and unite several Cuban exile groups under the control of Artime in an effort to enhance the cohesion of
the exiles and augment Artime's capability to launch propaganda and paramilitary attacks against the
Cuban mainiand. The overall mission of AMWORLD was to foment a popular unrising in Cuba which
could lead to the ultimate overthrow of Fidel Castro. There is no evidence that AMWORLD's mission
even remotely came close to fruition and no evidence that a projected government in exile was ever
considered as a viable option.”

SUBJECT: . ARRB Request CIA-IR-32, AMWORLD

1. The following is responsive to referent request.

2. AMWORLD was a project designed to support and unite
several Cuban exile groups under the control of Manuel
Artime Buesa. Its purpose was to try to enhance the

' cohesion of the various exile groups and provide Artime more

capability to launch propaganda and paramilitary attacks
against the Cuban mainland, the ultimate goal being to cause
a popular uprising in Cuba which would overthrow Fidel
Castro’s:' communist oriented dictatorship.

3. AMWORLD did not start until after the failed Bay of
Pigs invasion and after the release of Artime and other
invasion veterans from Cuban prisons. The goals and mission
of AMWORLD, of course, were never fully recognized and the
idea of Cuban government in exile not realized.

4. This completes our work on this request. I£ you
have any questions, please advise.

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board’s requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to:
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CLA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.
