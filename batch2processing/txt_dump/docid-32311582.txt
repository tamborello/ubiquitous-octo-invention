assignment in Mexico in November, 1960.

In the Resident Agencies, all Agents handle both
eriminal and security matters:

PRINCIPAL TYPES OF CASES HANDLED

The Mexico City Office handles practically every
type of case found in the domestic field. Most of the cases
fall into the following general fields:

Criminal cases, the great majority of which have
to do with Bureau fugitives, Selective Service violators -
and automobiles and other property stolen in the United States
and brought to either Mexico or Central American countries.
Also included in this category are police checks made for
the Embassy and other U. S. Government agencies. These are
handled as a gesture of cooperation with the Embassy and to
avoid interference by representatives of other Government
agencies in our dominant control of the police liaison in
Mexico. :

American communists, including a number of Security
Index subjects who either reside in or visit Mexico.

Border coverage (BOCOV).

Mexican subversive or anizations, whose activities
have. a direct bearing on the titernat security of the United
States. .

Cuban matters, including travel to and from Cuba
of U. S. citizens and intelligence concerning Cuban activities.

Espio: e matters. Due to the presence of a large
Soviet aipTonatts establishment in Mexico City, as well as
several satellite diplomatic establishments, this is considered
one of the most important phases of our work here. It has
been clearly established through such cases asLOXBLOOD,
LAROB,; [OVERLAND] TUMBLEWEED and most recently the GREASER ‘S)
case, that the’ Soviets are carrying on a large scale third
country operation against the United States from Mexico.

appears to be getting any good, nard “hitelligence concerning
the Cuban internal situation on a. current basis. He instructed
me that the Mexico City Office should intensify its coverage
on Cuban matters, and this is being done. At the present time
three Agents in the headquarters city spend about one-half of
their time on Cuban’ matters. One of these three Agents
dedicates the major portion of his remaining time to following
related Latin American matters and to handling physical
security checks of the telephones in the headquarters. and
Resident. Agent offices and. in the homes of personnel. The
major portion of the remaining time of the second Agent is
dedicated to thé handling of the activities of a portion of
the national subversive organizations in Mexico and Chinese
Communist. matters, as well as replying to name check requests

. name by various Embassy offices. The third: Agent handling
Cuban matters. in addition. handles the major portion of the
Espionage investigations in_the office, including the very
important (LAROB] 3 and [ OXBLOOD Houble agent cases, and follows()
the activities of 'Soviet and satellite diplomatic: éstablishménts
in Mexico City. .

4. Almost the entire time of one Agent is spent on
following, through informants, the activities of American
Communists, including a number of Security Index subjects, who
either reside in or visit Mexico, It.is felt that this coverage
has a vital direct bearing on the internal security of the
United States and should be continued. Through this coverage
it has been possible recently to come up with some highly
valuable information concerning a clandestine leadership branch
of the Mexican Communist Party. The activities of this group,
which activities are apparently unknown to the rank and file of
the regular Mexican Communist Party, are pointed toward the ~ '
take over of the: Mexican Government. from within in the next

.five to ten years. The effect of such a take over in terms of
Mexican-U.S. relations and on the internal security of the

United States is obvious. So far as is known, neither fthe CIA

nor any other U..S. Government intelligence agency] here ad %(u)
received any: information on this: clandestine leadership branc

of the Mexican. Communist - ‘Party.

5. As was. pointed out above, three Agents are assigned
full. time to criminal matters and. to. maintaining open liaison
with official government agencies, and the Number One Man
supervises all criminal cases and handles a substantial caseload
in the criminal field. It is felt that the statistics set forth
