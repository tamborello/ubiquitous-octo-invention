‘soldier and puts the military above everything. He is divorced

-8. & source who is al officer who has
‘ good contacts among Cuban officials (he hae not submitted many
reports, but they appear to have been accurate) reported in —~
September 1963 that Major José Samon FERNANDEZ Alvarez, Chief of
of Training, General Staff of the Cuban Rebel Aray, ie anti-
Communist and a military type in the strictest sense of the
word. He sticks to his military duties acd scrupulously
avoids politics; he keeps himself completely isolated from
all political elements. He is proud of his present status
and thankful to CASTRO for it; for fear of losing it he
appears wawilling to undertake any kind of activity against
-the CASTRO regime. CASTRO ig undoubtedly knowledgeable of
FERNANDEZ’ attitude and has sufficient confidence in him to.
retain him im his present position. CASTRO also is aware
that he has few officers with the military disciphine, --
know-how, and experience possessed by FERNANDEZ.
