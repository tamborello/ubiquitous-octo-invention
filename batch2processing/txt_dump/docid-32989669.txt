Memorandum for the Attorney General

NOTE CONTINUED:

Inspector J.A. Sizoo contacted SAC Atlanta on
6/21/66, instructing that this technical surveillance
coverage be discontinued immediately. It was discontinued
at 1:00 p.m., 6/21/66.

The Attorney General's notation concerning Hosea
Williams refers to an Interstate Transportation of Stolen
Motor Vehicles case under investigation by the Bureau
wherein the principal subject Harold Belton Andrews alleges
he stole four automobiles for subsequent sale to the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference headed by Dr. Martin Luther
King, Je.. It was developed by investigation one of these
stolen vehicles had been in the possession of Hosea Willlans
who is the Director of Voter Registration for King's
organization. Due to the ramifications involving the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and the civil rights movement,
the Criminal Division of the Department has been directing the
prosecution in this case rather than the U.S. Attorney.
Following presentation of the case to a Federal Grand Jury by
Departmental attorneys Andrews and one other person were
indicted, however, Hosea Williams was not indicted.
