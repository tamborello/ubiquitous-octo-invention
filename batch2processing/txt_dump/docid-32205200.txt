THE STATEMENT WHICH THE DEPARTMENT MADE ON APRIL 9 SAID,
IN PART, THAT WE SHARED WITH DR. MIRO CARDONA, “THE AIM OF .
RESTORING FREEDOM TO THE CUBAN PEOPLE.”

THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE AIM AND PURPOSE OF THE U.S., LET
THERE BE NO DOUBT ON THAT CENTRAL POINT.

NOW, A STATEMENT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED WHICH PURPORTS TO
BE THE REASONS GIVEN BY DR. MIRO CARDONA FOR HIS “IRREVOCABLE
DECISION" TO RESIGN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY
COUNCIL. .

THE STATEMENT SEEKS TO DISCREDIT SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS IN
THE GOVERNMENT AND TO QUESTION THE GOOD FAITH AND INTEGRITY OF
THEM, AS INDIVIDUALS, AND OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN DEALING WITH
THE CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. WHILE APPRECIATING THE URGENT
DESIRE OF THE CUBAN EXILES TO RETURN TO A FREE AND INDEPENDENT
CUBA AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE -- A DESIRE WHICH IS FULLY
SHARED BY THE PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES --
THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERS THIS RECKLESS STATEMENT A GROSS —
DISTORTION OF RECENT HISTORY AND OF THIS GOVERNMENT'S POLICY
WITH RESPECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF CASTRO-COMMUNISM FROM THIS
HEMISPHERE. .

THE DEPARTMENT WILL WISH TO CONTINUE CONSULTING WITH LEADERS
OF THE CUBAN EXILE COMMUNITY CONCERNING SUITABLE METHODS FOR
ACHIEVING OUR COMMON OBJECTIVES. HOWEVER, THE POLICIES OF
THE GOVERNMENT IN THE FIELD OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WILL CONTINUE
TO BE DETERMINED Ou FNS BRSES-OF HESTON MAEIONA EMFERESTS —

INMEDIATE STEP IN THIS DIRECTION THE U.S. WILL ARRANGE THAT EXILE
