1. Proceedings are currently underway to eliminate SUBJECT from the
U. S. Army on grounds of unsuitability under the provisions of AR

may become necessary to show that during 1967 and 1968 HE was not

in the employ of your agency in any manner, In this connection
request you advise USAPSG if your agency objects to the release

of the attached DA Form 341 (Agent Report), subject as above, dated
21 June 1968, to SUBJECT, HIS defense counsel, and the members of
the board, subject to dissemination restrictions imposed by the fact
that the report contains classified defense information.

2. Should your agency object to release of the particular information
included in the cited report, a letter from your agency stating that
SUBJECT was not in your employ, in any manner, while assigned to
Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe, would be equally sufficient.
