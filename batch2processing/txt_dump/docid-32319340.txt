~JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION ACT
OF 1992 (THE ACT); PUBLIC LAW (P.L.) 102-526
DECLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS

Classified "Secret" -ip-ite-ontinzeaty..

Under the stringent requirements of P.L. 102-526 we
have processed documents which are ready for release.

These documents contain information which reveal that
we had investigations and sensitive coverages of the CPUSA
headquarters, and foreign establishments such as the Tass News
Agency in New York and the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D. C.,
includinofpre-FISA technical} coverage on Tass. c

Other documents indirectly identify our two principal
SOLO assets who acted as liaison and were an integral part of the
funding mechanism between the CPUSA and the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union. Both are deceased, but the widow of SOLO
asset ,._Morri dex requested by attached letter that we not
releas@-any information that reveals the relationship of herself,
her husband and brother-in-law with the FBI until six months
after her death. A response to the letter is being prepared.
Mrs. Childs is writing a book about the SOLO operation. After
Morris Childs died, Gus Hall, head of the CPUSA, advised an asset
that he had learned that the FBI attended the funeral services, |
therefore, he knew Morris Childs had worked for the FBI.

 

No damage to ongoing operations will result from these
releases. Minimal damage is done to national security interests.

Every effort will be made to release all information
that does not harm national security interests.

       
     
     
 

The. Attorney General is being advised of
the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review becaus
electronic surveillances{were authorized by previous
General. These coveragéS and information from two jo
sources have been the subject of Attorney General
Privilege in past legal actions against the FBI.
