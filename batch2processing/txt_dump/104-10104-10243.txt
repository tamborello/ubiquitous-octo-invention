Dear Clarence:

I am enclosing neadline copyright story
wnich appeared in the afternoon States. I have
absolutely no inside information as I have not

even talked with George W. Healy, Jr., or anybody

else with the paper abcut the Kennedy Assassination

 

probe in a number of weexs. However, I know how
superconservative the paper is and I think it is
extremely significant that the powers that be. are
willing to go this far. From original skepticism,
many peopie around town are beginning to think Jim
migat have something. In any event, I don't believe

the C.I.A. can play ostrich much longer.
Sincerely,
Charles E, Dunbar, IIT
