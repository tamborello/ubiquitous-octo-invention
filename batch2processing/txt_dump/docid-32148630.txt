ReBuairtel 5/26/64, “with which was furnished a copy ~
of a translation of a Mexican Government document furnished to Uv
the Bureau by Mexico City airtel of 5/12/64. ; ;

ReBuairtel called attention to the reference in- the
translation to a list of reservations said to be in lieu of a
passengers' list of the Transportes Frontera Bus Line. This
reservation list mentioned in the translation is the same as
the manifest of Transportes Frontera Line (Exhibit D106) on.
which the name "OSWBD" was manifested in seat No. 4. As has
been pointed out previously to the Bureau, officials of
Transportes Frontera indicate that this list is utilized both :
for reservations and for assistance in the accounting office
of the company. : :

 

“2 Mexican Immigration Inspector JOSE’ MARIO DEL VALLE,
who assisted’ in the preparation of the document which was
translated, has advised that there is no list of passengers
related, to the Transportes Frontera bus trip on 10/2-3/63
from Mexico. City to Nuevo Laredo in addition to the reservation
i; list mentioned. Previous investigation by this office confirms
> this statement of Inspector DEL VALLE, The so-called reservation
list mentioned in the Mexican Government report is the only
list or manifest of passengers prepared by the Transportes
Frontera Bus Line. : U

“cépids ot the final official
report of the Mexican Government prepared in the Secretariat
of Foreign Relations and furnished to the Embassy here. This
airtel pointed out certain, discrepancies which existed between
this final official report’ and the letter of 5/6/64 prepared
by Acting Secretary of *“Gobernacion LUIS. ECHEVERRIA, the
translation of which letter was furnished with reBuairtel of _
5/26/64, The latter ins tructéd*-the Legat to furnish his views
as. to the course. of action to be .taken concerning the
dissemination of the translation if the. final official report
of the Mexican Government differed in substance from the
information c ained in the letter for which the translatio
was prepared @®

AS was pointed out in Mexico City airtels of 5/12/64
and 5/26/64, neither the final official report of the Mexican
Government nor the ECHEVERRIA letter appeared to contain
information which had not been previously reported to the
Bureau. No apparent purpose would be served in furnishing the
President's Commission with a translation of the ECHEVERRIA
letter for use in making a comparison of it with, the final
official report of the Mexican Government which was forwarded
to the Commission through the State Department by the Embassy

; there. fAt the same time to do so might result in the compromise

«of MEX-192, who furnished .a copy of the ECHEVERRIA letter to
this office on a very confidential basis without the knowledge
-of ECHEVERRIA.’ Unless the Bureau perceives some very strong
reason for furnishing the Commission with a translation of thé

- ECHEVERRIA letter, it is recommended that this not. be done, Che ;
