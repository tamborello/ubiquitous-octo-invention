brother “SAM this date in regard to attending a viewing of
an unknown person. ROCCO was unable to go on account of
his injury. .

 

9/28/64

Source furnished no information except domestic
affairs of ROCCO SCAFIDI, other than the fact that he was
visited by an unknown male, apparently a relative of his.

9/29/64

ROCCO SCAFIDI made an outgea@ing call to "J.R,"

(SA J, ROBERT PEARCE). He advised that he had been around
to sign some insurance papers; had visited 8th Street and

observed nobody; and had talked to his brother SAM for awhile.
TONY COPPOLA, SCAFIDI's employer, lost money at a crap game
the previous Sunday. CHICKIE NARDUCCI won at the game. He
talked of an address on Passyunk Avenue, Philadelphia (address
of JACK WILLIAMS, aka) and said "there is a rumor going around
that they are pushing ANGE (BRUNO) to get PHIL (TESTA) out and
that everybody is asking ANGE is he sure PHIL is getting out,"

It is noted that during the conversation source was
asked where he was calling from, and he advised he was calling
from his home but that no one was present. He was telephonically
instructed not to use his home phone to contact the FBI Office.
On 9/30/64, in person, he was again strongly reminded not to use
his telephone to contact the Agents. He was reminded that his
wife should not have knowledge of his activity. He said that
she did not know of his activities. He said she thinks "J.R,"
is a brother of his employer, TONY COPPOLA.

; : Concerning the above-described call on 9/29/64, the
above took place:

HELENA SCAFIDI: What does it look like?
ROCCO SCAFIDI: Good.
HELENE SCAFIDI: Got to go out tomorrow? i,

HELENA SCAFIDI: What did he say? |
ROCCO SCAFIDI: Try to get something off him tonight but

it's too late now----- tomorrow------ .

From the above, it could not definitely be deter-
mined if ROCCO SCAFIDI's wife has knowledge of his association
with the FBI, It appeared, however, that she was present during
the above-described phone call but it is noted that the FBI by
name was not mentioned during the phone call;

9/30/64

ROCCO SCAFIDI remained around his premises with no
pertinent activity.

10/1/64

4n unknown woman visited the SCAFIDI household but
was out of range of the source, ROCCO SCAFIDI contacted GABE:
(ROBERT GABRIEL, his attorney) to inquire how he made out with
ROCCO's ppobation office. (SCAFIDI later verified this conversa-
tion). Abtorney GABRIEL advised SCAFIDI he could have his pro-
pation at Philadelphia dismissed for $200. SCAFIDI later talked
