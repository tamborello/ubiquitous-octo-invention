WATER. ‘ADDITIONAL COTTON IN STORAGE WILL PROBABLY HAVE SUSTAINED
DAMAGE aS IT 1S VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO HUMIDITY. MUCH OF COTTON .
STORAGE FACILITIES ARE OF POOR CONSTRUCTION AND’ LEAKAGE WOULD
BE q SERIOUS PROBLEM. IF ANY REPLANTING IS-ATTEMPTED, THERE WILL
BE AN EXTREMELY LOW YIELD, AS WAS PROVED IN 1962 WHEN THEY TRIED
REPLANTING IN OCTOBER.

7. BEANS/CORN: THESE ARE MAJOR CROPS IN CAMAGUEY AND

-ORTENTE PROVINCES, AND ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 59 PERCENT OF

ALL PRODUCTION IN CUBA. ALL OF THE CROPS ALREADY PLANTED, WHICH

WOULD BE SCHEDULED FOR HARVESTING IN DECEMBER, WILL HAVE BEEN LOST.
8. COFFEE: THE COFFEE HARVEST WAS JUST GETTING STARTED AND

THE ENTIRE NON-HARVESTED CROP WILL HAVE BEEN LOST, PLUS A LARGE

PERCENTAGE OF WHAT THEY MAY HAVE IN STORAGE AS COFFEE NEEDS |

TO BE DRIED FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS. THE LOSS WILL COST AT LEAST

‘25 PERCENT OF THE CROP FOR THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS AS COFFEE

PLANTS NEED AT. LEAST TWO YEARS TO RECOVER. HOWEVER, SOME COFFEE
IS GROWN IN LAS VILLAS AND PINAR DEL RIO PROVINCES, AND THIS

‘PROBABLY HaS NOT BEEN GREATLY AFFECTED.

9. CACAO: ALL CACAO GROWN IN CUBA IS.PRODUCED IN ORIENTE

_ PROVINCE, AND THE ENTIRE CROP WILL HAVE BEEN LOST.

 
“PAGE 5 RUEPCR 56CONFIDENTIAL

1@. FRUIT: THERE WILL HAVE BEEN A VERY HEAVY LOSS IN.
CITRUS FRUITS, NOT ONLY FOR THIS YEAR BUT NEXT. THE SAME SITUATION
APPLIES TO OTHER NATIVE FRUITS SUCH AS MANGOES, THE ENTIRE
PINEAPPLE CROP IN CAMAGUEY WILL HAVE SUFFERED HEAVY DAMAGE.
1. CATTLE: THERE WILL HAVE BEEN a CATASTROPHIC LOSS’ OF
CATTLE IN CAMAGUEY AND ORIENTE PROVINCES.

12. IN ADDITION TO THE DAMAGE TO CROPS, IT SHOULD BE
RECOGNIZED THAT THERE WILL BE VERY HEAVY DAMAGE TO STORAGE BUILDINGS
FOR FERTILIZER, PESTICIDES, AND INSECTICIDES, AS THE STORAGE
FACILITIES FOR SUCH PRODUCTS WERE VERY BAD. END OF REPORT. GP-1

IN JULY 1962 aS A POLITICAL REFUGEE: -

SOURCE IS A GRADUATE AGRICULTURAL ENGINEER. PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE
FROM CUBA, HE WORKED IN THE PLANT DISEASE SECTION IF INRA.

(SOURCE IS NORMALLY AVAILABLE FOR RE INTERROGATION SHOULD THIS REPORT
GENERATE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.) .
1. DURING MY-YEARS OF SERVICE WITH THE GOC, I TRAVELED ALL

OVER THE ISLAND, AND AM THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH CROP CONDITIONS
IN THE-VARIOUS PROVINCES. BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, I BELIEVE THAT
THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS THE DAMAGE DONE TO CUBAN AGRICULTURE BY
HURRICANE FLORA. |
| 2. RICE: ALL OF THE SUMMER CROP WHICH HAD BEEN PLANTED FOR
"HARVESTING IN FUBRUARY AND MARCH IN CAMAGUEY AND ORIENTE PROVINCES
‘HAS BEEN DESTROYED. THESE TWO PROVINCES REPRESENT MORE THAN 5¢
PERCENT OF TOTAL RICE PRODUCTION IN CUBA. THEY UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE
LOST ALL LEVIES AND DIKES, AND WILL HAVE TO REPARE A CROP ALL OVER
AGAIN. IT WOULD TAKE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WORKING ON AN EMERGENCY
BASIS TO SALVAGE ANYTHING OF THE PRESENT CROP. IT SHOULD ALSO BE
RECOGNIZED THAT SEVERE DAMAGE MUST HAVE BEEN INCURRED BY MILLS
AND STORAGE BUILDINGS, WHICH WERE NOT IN GOOD CONDITION TO BEGIN -

WITH.
PAGE 3 RUEPCR SS CONFIDENTIAL ;
| 3. BANANAS: THE ENTIRE CROP HAS BEEN LOST, AND THERE WILL
BE NO PRODUCTION IN THE EFFECTED PROVINCES FOR SIX TQ TEN MONTHS
UNTIL NEW PLANTS ARE READY FOR HARVEST. ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS WILL.
BE THE NECESSITY OF CUTTING FALLEN TREES TO SAVE THE FIELDS.
CAMAGUEY AND ORIENTE PROVINCES REPRESENT OVER 56 PERCENT OF
TOTAL PRODUCTION OF BANANAS.
4, KENAF: ALL KENAF PRODUCED IN CUBA COMES FROM CAMAGUEY
AND WAS ALREADY IN HARVEST. THEY PROBABLY HAVE LOST ALL PLANTED
UNLESS THEY ARE WILLING TO ASSIGN SEVERAL THOUSAND: LABORERS ON
AN EMERGENCY BASIS TO TRY AND SAVE SOME OF THE CROP.
- 5, TOBACCO: THERE WILL BE SEVERE LOSS IN SANCTI SPIRITUS
AND CABAIGUAN AREAS DUE TO HIGH WINDS. HOWEVER, THEY WILL HAVE
TIME TO REPLANT. THERE IS NOT TOBACCO PRODUCTION OF ANY IMPORTANCE
IN CAMAGUEY AND ORIENTE PROVINCES. |
6. COTTON: CAMAGUEY AND ORIENTE PROVINCES REPRESENT ABOUT -
75 PER CENT OF TOTAL PRODUCTION. NORMAL PLANTING ENDS AROUND
1 SEPTENBER, AND THERE WILL BE NO CHANCE TO PLANT AGAIN. 1
BELIEVE THEY HAVE LOST 75 PER CENT OF THE COTTON CROP AT LEAST,
WHICH WILL REPRESENT ABOUT 60 PER CENT OF ALL COTTON GROWN IN
CUBA. COTTON IS LOST AFTER IT SPENDS AS MUCH AS TWO DAYS UNDFR
