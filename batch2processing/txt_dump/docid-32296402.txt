from Phoenix, Arizona and GENE BUFALINO of Los Angeles, California
called at the office of JAMES LANZA. Informant advised that the
purpose of this call was unknown, however, JAMES LANZA was quite
disturbed at the visit of TONY MIRANDA. This may be based on the
fact that MIKE MIRANDA, aka, who is known to JAMES LANZA, is now
the consiglieri of the VITO GENOVESE Family of La Cosa Nostra in
New York City. LANZA advised the informant that he should have
been advised that TONY MIRANDA was coming to San Francisco and he

turned from a trip to New York where he had been subpoenaed to

his daughter that CAMARATA as well as others in California should
be ready and available in the event they are called upon to per-
form a service in the future. CAMARATA advised that with all the
trouble that was going on in the United States with the federal
agencies and the organization, he did not want to have anything
to do with it. CAMARATA could not see why JOHN MISURACA could
not understand that there was too much trouble going on to get

cisco Bay Area as they were all too fat and satisfied with their
present existence."

formant stated that MARINO did not indicate the purpose of their
