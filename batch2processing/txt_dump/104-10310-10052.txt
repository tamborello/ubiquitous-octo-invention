MEMORANDUM FOR. THE RECORD .

SUBJECT: Telecon with Senate Select Committee Staff

- 1. ‘Mr. Dan Dwyer contacted the undersigned ‘tele-
phonically and referred to comments made by Messrs.
Rocca and Hartman regarding the Garrison investigation.

According to these two gentlemen, there was an individ~

ual within the CI Staff who prepared weekly summaries
of the Garrison investigation. Mr. Dwyer asked if I
knew who this person might be. I advised that as I
had. previously stated to him I was unaware of any such
summaries being prepared nor did I know who might have
Rrepared them. Mr. Dwyer then went on to say that
while he was not interested in reviewing the Garrison
201 itself, he wished.to know if there was a machine >
run on the file available for his perusal when he next
came to Headquarters building. I advised that I was
unaware of the existence of the 201 and if one existed

I had no knowledge to whom it might be charged or. what

its contents were. Regarding a machine run I simply

‘did not know whether one was available assuming there

was a 201. Mr. Dwyer asked if I could check into the
machine run and I assured him I would.

2. In response to Mr. Dwyex' s query regarding a
G-135A check, I told him that I had reviewed the files
and located such an INS request dated 5 December 1961
and not 13 December 1961 as he had indicated. Moreover
the document in question was in the Office of Security
file on Oswald which he, Dan Dwyer, had previously
reviewed. Mr. Dwyer commented that he may have missed
it. However the 13 December 1961 date was the Agency

reply to INS. Regrettably INS is firmly abiding by
the Third Agency Rule and has refused to show the
responses to the Senate investigators. I suggested
that I, would double check the files to see if we
have a copy of the response to INS. If we do not
then I suggest that Mr. Dwyer ask INS to burn a copy
of the document in question and refer it to. us.
Once received we will then make it. available to the
Select Committee for review.

3. The above apparently satisfied Mr. Dwyer
who said he would check with the undersigned regarding
the location of the document in Agency files and if we
could not locate the document he would follow the
procedure suggested. :

4. Based on above. the undersignéd checked with

“Mr. Mayo of CI Staff regarding the existence of a

201 on Garrison. Mr. Mayo! advised on 5 December that
a 201 did indeed.exist which. contained two documents

and three cross references and that the remainder of

material associated with the Garrison. investigation .
was in the 100-300-017 file charged to C/CI/R&A.

-Efforts are currently underway by Mr. Mayo! to lecate
the 100~300- 017 file.
