possibility exists that NORMAN ROTHMAN may still be able to
negotiate for the stock certificates. .

‘ (3) will furnish background information from the
files of the Miami Division regarding NORMAN ROTHMAN. Miami,
at this time, should make absolutely no effort to contact
NORMAN ROTHMAN as the possibfity exists that CHESTER GRAY
