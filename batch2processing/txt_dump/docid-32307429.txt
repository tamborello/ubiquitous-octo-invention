this matter at this time unless requested to do so by

RE: POSSIBLE COUP BY
PANAMANTAN NATIONAL GUARD

It was alleged that he was in Panama at the time to
make prearranged collections of funds for a coup attempt
by AMADO SANJUR.

RODRIGUEZ said that he has been unable to
contact AMADO SANJUR since his return to the United
States from confinement in Panama, SANJUR has failed
to return several calls by RODRIGUEZ to his residence
in California. RODRIGUEZ is puzzled by this because
he did not cooperate with the Panamanian G-2 concerning
SANJUR, despite being tortured. At any rate, he
continued, he knows of no current plans by SANJUR to
overthrow the Panamanian Government and did not even
know that SANJUR has visited the Miami area several
times this summer. Additionally, he has not heard
that Cuban exiles are cooperating with Panamanian
exiles to overthrow the Panamanian Government. He
said it is unlikely that Cuban exiles would participate
in such plans and even more unlikely that Cuban exiles
would financially support such plans.

On August 31, 1976, MM T-2 advised that AMADO

‘SANJUR, exiled PNG Colonel, had been in the Miami

area the preceding week, as a friend of the source was,
visiting Miami from Panama at that time and spoke
telephonically with SANJUR.. The friend had been staying
at the Shelborne Hotel, Miami Beach, and encountered

there a bellboy. who is’ the brother or cousin of SANJUR
and who furnished the visitor a local telephone number

for SANJUR.

Source recalled that he saw: SANSUR at the Miami °
Beach boxing match in June of this year involving ROBERTO
DURAN, World lightweight champion from Panama. He did
not speak with SANJUR. ; /
