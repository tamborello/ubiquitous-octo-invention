In the CAPOLINO apartment numerous hunting
rifles were displayed in racks. The topic of hunting
was mentioned by the SAS and CAPOLINO voluntarily stated
that he was hunting in Canada during the Fall of 1965.

: He did not, however, comment on who he was with and it
was felt that the SAS should not indicate any knowledge
| : of CAPOLINO's activities as reported by the RCMP.

CAPOLINO indicated:a willingness to contact the
FBI should he be confronted with any illegal pressures in
his new location. He further advised that two of his
brothers would be remaining in the NYC area in the
construction field and before he left the area, he would
talk to his brothers and advise them of the interest of the
: FBI and assistance which can be obtained if the brothers '
are confronted: by illegal pressures by any labor unions
or other persons.
