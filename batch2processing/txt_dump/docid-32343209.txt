The Case Officer then started discussing the case of a Bulgarian,
GIORGIEV, who was arrested by the Bulgarians in Mogcow in 1963. SUBJECT
obtain his information on this case from SHERAPIN, and Alexander PAPOVICH
in 1963. : :

SUBJECT said GIORGIEV was invited to Moscow in 1963 at the suggestion
of the Bulgarian MVD. He was settled in the Metropole Hotel and kept
under TV surveillence. While he was in Moscow his xooms in Bulgaria
were searched and evidence was found (radio) which was sufficient for
the Deputy Chief of the Bulgarian MVD to go to Moscow, arrest him and
return him to Bulgaria for questioning and trial or court martial.

SUBJECE went to Bulgaria in 1961 to help them on American cases.
He stated there was no suspicion of GIORGIEV at that time. GIORGIEV
had worked in the United States and was believed to have been recruited
at that time.

The Bulgarians, on confronting GIORGIEV in the Metropole Hotel,
said, "George DUVAL, you're under arrest". .

At this point the interview ended and SUBJECT adked the Case Officer
to congratulate the boys and wish them all a good holiday for him. He’
did this when the Case Officer said he didnot think he would be back
on 3 July.

Friday 4nd, JBI y.1964, - The Case Officer wanted to discuss the KGB
involvement in the OSWALD case.

. SUBJECT said he did not know that OSWALD went to Moscow from Helsinki

but that OSWALD's visa application was processed in the normal manner

and KGB had a copy of the visa application. ‘Russian Fmbassies, since
1960, have authority to issue visas in three to five days after application.

OSWALD applied orally, and later n writing, for Soviet citizenship.
A copy of the written request went to|/ KGB.” A copy of this request was
sent to the Supreme Soviet after OSW. slashed his wrists.

KGB studied reports on OSWALD prepared by Case Officer KRUZNOF and
decided OSWALD was not normal so he was of no interest to KGB: and was
not considered desirable ‘for Soviet citizenship. His file was sent to
Minsk because he was to live and work in Minsk.
