«On the morning of | December 1963, PARMUTH assisted RESCIGNO

in installing audio microphones under the flooring of an LCHARVEST occupied
apartment. (See HMMA=22608, Hi Dec 63, para 5.4.) Lines leading from the

audio installation to the LP were strung and secured below the flooring which had

ample semi-crawling space between the target area and the LP apartment.
RESCIGNO and PARMUTH entered this crawling space by removing a small
section of flooring located inside the LP apartment. There is also a trap door
leading into the crawl space at the front entrance hall of the building although
