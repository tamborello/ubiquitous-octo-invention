Howard,

The attached October 11, 1996 letter to the Director from the Assassination Records
Review Board (ARRB), advises of determinations concerning JFK records. Upon receipt of this
letter, a seven-day period for appeal to the President of the United States exists.

The ARRB made decisions on 174 documents, which the John F. Kennedy Task Force
(JFKTF) is currently reviewing for appeal concerns. The Information Resources Division will
advise through electronic communication the Criminal Investigative and National Security

Divisions and the Office of General Counsel of any problem areas for their recommendations for
appeal. :

The Documents listed in the letter provide either appeal issues or the JFKTF is in
agreement with the ARRB determinations and no postponement issues remain. Additionally,
some of the documents are duplicates of those previously decided by the ARRB and are without

appeal issues.
