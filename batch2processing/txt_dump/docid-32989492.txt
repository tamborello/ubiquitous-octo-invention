Continuation of FD-302 of CARMEN A. DIPLACIDO ,On 10/5/92 - , Page 2

DIPLACIDO said that dissemination of such information
is not sent to the U. S. Secret Service in every case.

He commented that how a possible letter from WILLIAM J.
CLINTON (relating to his possibly renouncing his citizenship) was
worded would determine how it was handled by the uUSDOS.

If this possible letter said that he wanted to renounce

his citizenship, it most likely would have been disseminated to
the U. S. Secret Service.

If "someone" said that he/she wanted to be naturalized
in another country, this would probably not be the type of
situation wherein dissemination could be made about such to the
U. S. Secret Service. A person can be naturalized in another
country without giving up their U. S. citizenship but "at the
time" (circa 1969-1970) most countries wanted such a person to
give up their prior citizenship if they were naturalized in
another country, and the United States was a country that took
this stance at that time.

DIPLACIDO. advised that he thought that any oo.
correspondence (relating to a person's intent to denounce his/her
citizenship) would be sent to the USDOS passport file.

He thinks that passport records were sent to the
Washington National Records Center (WNRC) (at Suitland, Maryland)
in three-year blocks before 1978.

If WILLIAM J. CLINTON's 1968 passport application had
been retired to the Federal Records Center, any possible letter
from CLINTON expressing his intent to denounce his U. S.
citizenship would have been kept separately in the passport
records. This would depend on what he requested, what the
response of the USDOS was, and whether the 1976 passport
application of CLINTON's had come in yet.

He indicated that there may be a question as to if such
possible letters (if they existed) were kept in passport records.
He said that no one seems to know where they would be kept.

DIPLACIDO advised that in 1968, a U. S. passport was
valid for five (5) years. Accordingly, CLINTON's 1968 passport
would have expired in 1973.

Zontinuation of FD-302 of _ CARMEN A. DIPLACIDO ,On 10/5/92 _.» Page

RETIRED USDOS EMPLOYEE ASSOCIATED WITH ADJUDICATIONS RELATING TO
EUROPE:

DIPLACIDO provided the following information regarding
a person who could possibly have information about an.
adjudication of denunciation request coming in from Europe in the
late 1960s-early 1970s.

He said that a woman named VIRGINIA CARROLL who retired
from the USDOS in 1979, 1980 or 1981, was (while still employed
with the USDOS) in a group of officers that handled denunciations
coming in from Europe. She was an Assistant Branch Chief in the
late 1960s to early 1970s timeframe. "Europe" would have
included England.

DIPLACIDO suggested contact with the USDOS. Retirement
Office to possibly locate CARROLL if an interview of her is. of
interest to thé FBI.

He thinks that she spent most of the latter part of hér
USDOS career in the adjudication office.

VIRGINIA GLADHILL (OF THE U. S. PASSPORT OFFICE) :

DIPLACIDO said that VIRGINIA GLADHILL “has been in
'records' (of the U. S. Passport Office) a long time."

Date of transcription 10/16/92

CARMEN A. DIPLACIDO, Director, Citizens Consular
Services, Office of Consular Affairs, United States Department of
State (USDOS) (202-647-3666) was telephonically contacted by
Special Agent (SA) THOMAS FITZPATRICK on this date and DIPLACIDO
therefore provided the following pertinent information: (It is
noted that DIPLACIDO was previously interviewed in person by SA
FITZPATRICK and another FBI SA on 10/2/92.)

ADJUDICATION CONSIDERATIONS :

DIPLACIDO said "I am a very senior guy knowledgeable of
the adjudication area" (as regards adjudication of a United
States (U.S.) citizen's expressed intent to denounce his U. S.
citizenship).

He said that "I was on an adjudication desk starting in
August, 1970." . .

Under certain circumstances, the USDOS could send an
adjudication letter or a citizen's name to the U. S. Secret
Service based on a request being made by a citizen to renounce
his/her U. S. Citizenship. ‘To his: knowledge, the USDOS would not
send such a letter or citizen's name to any other agency.

He believes that this requirement for the USDOS to
provide information to the U. S. Secret Service in this regard
was based on action of the Warren Commission as a result of its
investigation of the assassination of U. S. President JOHN F.
KENNEDY (in November 1963). DIPLACIDO believes that KENNEDY's
reported assassin, LEE HARVEY OSWALD, had reportedly expressed an
interest in the past in renouncing his U. S. citizenship.
Accordingly, apparently the Warren Commission felt it was
appropriate for the USDOS to be required to disseminate to the U.
S. Secret Service information received by the USDOS about other
persons who expressed an interest to the USDOS in renouncing
their U. S. citizenship.
