The above instructions received from CIA
on 6/25/65 were given in person to VICTOR ESPINOSA.
ESPINOSA manifested discouragement over the lack of
cooperation from the CIA and merely stated ‘that he was
absolutely positive that the peovle involved in this
Plot, and primarily ROLANDO L.“\CUBELAS, would definitely
in the near future make an attempt upon the lives of
FIDEL CASTRO and several other leading figures in
the Cuban Government. . . . ‘

ESPINOSA on 6/25/65 stated that CIA probacly
was reluctant to commit itself to him but he felt sure
that one way or another, CIA must be fully cognizant

ya of the plot or have some interest in it. ESPINOSA
