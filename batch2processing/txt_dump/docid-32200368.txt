one Bill JOHNSON) that he (STURGIS) had killed President John F. Kennedy.
When asked why STURGIS would impart this interesting bit of news to a

2, STURGIS’ alleged involvement in the late President's assassination
has been widely reported by the news nedia[ __}es previously stated OTHER 4
his intention to go to the news media regarding his allegations against
DEA. Therefore, he is likely to mention the STURGIS allegation as
well. Assuming that he would also tell them that he had reported the
