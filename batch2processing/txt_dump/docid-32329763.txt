(The following information is being set forth
for the benefit of the Agents to whom the cases are. assigned.
It ig obvious from the contents that this information
cannot be used in the details of any report.) . .

The informant on August 2, 197), advised he had
just recently got in touch with GUS ALEX. ALEX made reference
immediately, to the surprise of informant, that he was aware
informant had just returned from northern Wisconsir where
he had attended a meeting with all the defendants and
attorneys involved in the Teamster Union Pension Fund
Case. Informant said he did not ask ALEX how he came upon
this information but was aware of the way the"Chicago Outfit"
works and their close association with the Teamster
Union Officails and the defendants. ALEX freely discussed
the "WEASEL" (IRWIN WEINER) and the now deceased PHIL
ALDERISIO. He also discussed the job: of ART NASSAR who
recently became involved in the teamster case.

Concerning the "WEASEL". ALEX stated he never
had any use for this individual and several years ago
when PHIL attempted to introduce him to the "WEASEL" he
walked away from both of them. Informant stated that
from the sound of GUS ALEX's conversation, he got the
impression that he held nothing but contempt for both
IRWIN WEINER and PHIL ALDERISIO, who they referred to
consistently as the "Mad dog". At one point in the
conversation, ALEX stated that "they" did not blame
HAROLD LURIE for doing what has apparently been done
already and that is testify against his old pals. ALEX stated
that ALDERISIO and WEINER treated LURIE like a "dog" and

- like anyone else, LURIE now has a chance to get even with

the "WEASEL".

Also during the conversation concerning the
"WEASEL", ALEX made a significant remark. He stated,
"I wouldn't be surprised what side the 'WEASEL' is on."

oe Informant stated when "Outfit people" start :
to think along these lines, and they have other important
people involved in the same case, there is a good chance
that WEINER may become a "real loser." -

WEINER appeared extremely worried about
the up coming case and is very much concerned about his
chances of going to jail. Informant recalled the

_ INFORMANTS

Extreme caution should be used in. the
use of information furnished by the following sources.
In most cases the information furnished by each
of the following sources can*be easily traced back
to the respective informant.

CG 9561-PC advised on (7/30/74, that.a
good friend of his recently was.at.a conference where
the Teamster Union Pension Fund. defense attorneys were
gathered. The place was at TOM O'SHANTER's and. the
conference was called mainly to determine what should
be done about Judge BAUER.

The attorneys claimed BAUER has given them
nothing but a hard time. Obviously, they have not been
able to reach him in any way. It was decided at this
conference that if they can postpone this case long enough
BAUER will be promoted to the United States Court of
Appeals and they would get another judge. It was stated
the prospects look good for such a promotion.

Informant stated their strategy for getting
continuances is to use "JENNER". They can always claim
JENNER is tied up on important matters in Washington.

It is also well known JENNER will not be involved ‘in this
case when it does come up for trial.

CG 9561-PC advised on 8/2/74, that

~"Yhé was Vacationing near Rheinlander, Wisconsin, with JIMMY
DI ANTONIO... While driving in this area, they were "spotted"
by two other persons in another vehicle, namely; IRV WEINER
and ALLAN DORFMAN. The occupants of the other approached
the informant and asked " What he was doing in the North
Country". Whereupon the informant told WFINER he was on a
vacation trip. : ;

; Informant stated he was then invited to accompany
DORFMAN and WEINER to a luxurious lodge near Eagle River
called "Jack O Lantern". This lodge covers several hundred
acres of land including a lake. Apparently, it is owned
by the Teamster Union of Chicago and is used by Teamster
Officials as a summer retreat. This lodge also has a:

: landing strip and informant stated he was told it is only
a 38 minute flight on a Teamster jet from Meigs Field in
Chicago to this resort.

Informant stated he then accompanied WEINER and
DORFMAN to the Jack O Lantern Lodge. There. he met RAY SMITH
who represents one of the defendants in the Teamster Union
Pension Fund Case. Also, he met several attorneys from
"JENNER's" office. These individuals invited him to attend
discussions and he was told the purpose of the meeting in
the north. country was to study the strategy to be used in
the upcoming Pension Fund Case.

The informant stated all during the session at
the Jack 0 Lantern, WEINER appeared very much concerned,
but the only concern that DORPMAN showed was for his
mother, ROSE, who went off on a drunk after her son got
into his recent trouble. Informant stated she has done
this before and used to do it when her husband was alive.

Informant stated from hearing the conversation -
in this lodge, it was apparent they recognize their biggest
trouble is United States District Court (USDC) Judge BAUER.
Apparently ‘they have made no headway in "reaching" him and
-he has turned down numerous . petitions as proposed by the
defendants. ; : :

They also discussed the possiblity of using
JENNER and his problems as a motion for asking for numerous
continuancesto prevent, the case from coming up before
BAUER. They also stated that BAUER is now lined up as
successor to. the recently resigned Judge OTTO KERNER.

Informant stated that they have now lined up a
witnesses to discredit the testimony of HAROLD LURIE. §~
His name was given as MAURIE GRAY who had prior business
dealings with HAROLD LURIE and now claims LURIE took
him for$100,000.00. :

From the discussion heard at this resort, informant
stated the defendants all realize that they have a
"problem" and that their problem is further aggravated because
of the position of Judge BAUER, and getting this case
taken away from BAUER is going to be their main objective.

Informant stated they discussed the prosecuting
attomey, MATT LYDON and were not too concerned with
LYDON. The general trend of conversation was that they
were not too concerned with the United States Attorney's
(USA) Office as a whole. Informant stated the only
interpretation he could make of comments along. this line
was that they were confident they had the best Republican
attorney in the country (JENNER) and felt certain JENNER's
credentials would have some effect on the USA, THOMPSON .
and his assistants. :
