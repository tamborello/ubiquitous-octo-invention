_ LOS PINOS NUEVOS, also known as
The New Pines (LPN)
INTERNAL SECURITY = CUBA
NEUTRALITY MATTERS

Previous investigation has reflected that the:
Los. Pinos Nueyos. (LPN) is an anti-FIDEL CASTRO organiza-
tion of Cuban exiles headquartered in Miami, under the -
leadership of ZACAR FAACOSTAGARCIA, and that this or- ia
ganization has been making plans for a raid against Cuba
in their 26' vessel THE LIBERTY, which is kept in the
Miami area. ‘

CURRENT ACTIVITIES

 

On June 15, ‘1965, GERALD PATRICKAHEMMING, 1036
S.W. 5th Street, Miami} an American soldier of fortune”
and adventurer, who has been associated with ZACARIAS
ACOSTA for the past year, advised that the LPN has been. - BS
unable to execute any military mission against Cuba. ;
One of HEMMING's associates, "Little JOE"/GARMAN, has fie
been working as' technical adviser for ACOSTA up until / 2.
about 2 months ago. During that time GARMAN found that
ACOSTA and his associates had been paying considerable
Sums of money for arms. GARMAN examined these weapons
- and found they were inoperative. Some of these' weapons
had welded barrels, some had missing parts and many of
them could never be made Operative. ~

After several months of association with ACOSTA
and his men, GARMAN concluded, according to HEMMING,
that the LPN lacked experience and technical "Imow how"

for any successful mission against Cuba. He also re-
garded their equipment as being inadequate, consequently |
_ GARMAN advised ACOSTA.and his men to save their money
and either forget about mounting a mission against Cuba

- or to join some group which had more experience. GARMAN
left the LPN in disgust and is no longer associated with
it.

HEMMING expressed the opinion that the. LPN has.
no potential for any serious action against Cuba.

‘ On July 22, 1965, MM T-1, an individual who -is
personally acquainted with leading ‘pembers of the LPN,
advised that during the past 2 years he had conferred
“on nuinerous occagions with ACOSTA and other members 9f
the organization, concerning their military plans, but
nothing had ever'developed and MM T-1 had reached the
conclusion that this organization has little, if any,
potential for military action. He pointed out that the
LPN lacks experience, military equipment, and adequate
means of transportation. He advised he has no evidence
the LPM has any immediate plans for action against Cuba.

On July 23, 1965, MM T=2, a Cuban exile who has
been active in Cuban revolutionary matters in the Miami
area for the past 5 years, advised that ZACARIAS ACOSTA,
former Mayor of Regla, Cuba, is closely associated with

- former members of the ‘BATISTA regime and has obtained some
money and other contributions from these persons over the
past 2 years, and has accumulated some military, equipment.

MM T-2 said that LPN is a very small group, it
hopes to accomplish some military action against Cuba, but
