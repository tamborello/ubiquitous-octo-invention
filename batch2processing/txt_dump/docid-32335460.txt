C,. ANTIN that MORT FiANKLIN and UGEN ca ke go back maybe

5 te 7 years. FRANKLIN has placed numerous sports bets with
CIASULLO in years past and has even purchased anew station

wagon from CIASULLO that was stolen and retitled by CIASULLC.
CIASULLO maintains control of FiANKLIN mainly through intimidation.
Cencerning the recent bust of FiANKLIN by the Drug Enforcement
Agency (DEA), the source advised that oviginally CIASULLO

had been offered the deal by JOHN NANDI, but he, CIASULLO,

turned the deal down and FRANKLIN picked up the option. |

   

On January 29, 1976, source advised SAs xICHA:D C.
AKTIN and PATRICK J. FOXAN as follows:

During the initial contact that the source had with
FAANKLIN in late December, another job was mentioued by FaANKLIN.
This job involved the destruction of the building that held
the records and evidence for the narcotics case against WA..DI
and FAANKLIN which caused their recent indictment and arzest.
According to the source, although FRANKLIN did not mention
NAKDI's name as being behind this destruction of evidence, source
from his experience with FRANKLIN and his knowing FiANKLIN's .
spinelessness, source believes NAxDI to be the pzime mover in .
the destruction. FRANKLIN instructed the source to find some-
one to handle this job, which would pay $25,000. Source was
recently told by FRANKLIN that the bombing would not occur
until the hearing which was to take place in Miami duving the.
week of January 19, 1976, and it was determined exactly how
good a case the Government had concerning thei. narcotics
violations.

Sourea then mentioned that if "they}' meaning the
source and his contacts, GiS0CO, et al, were to handle some
of the azsons for CUNNINGHAM through FRANKLIN: and NA:.DI, they
(source and others) would be in a position to learn the
details concerning the destruction of the building in Miami.
Source then mentioned there would be no harm in this, in that
no one would be killed. The source was specifically instructed
by SAs AkTIN dan@ FORAN that he was in no way to facilitate

or have anything whatsoever to do with any arson case involving
anyone at anytime. The source stated that if that is how

the FBI felt, he understood and would not participate in any way.

: Source stated that through personal conversation with
‘FRANKLIN, he learned that FRANKLIN and NAXDI and’ CUNIINGHAM
have telephone numbers. of pay phones where they can reach one
another on a daily basis. There are separate telephone contact
points by the specific day of the week.

Source advised that FRANKLIN is leaving for Florida
on January 21, 1976 and will be back in Cleveland by Januazy 25,
1976. The purpose of this trip is to appear in court regarding
the narcotics violation. The source further noted that the
.eason for FxANKLIN's involvement in the arsons contemplated
by CUNNINGHAM was that FXANKLIN owes NAsDI money from his bond
that was put up for him by NAKXDI. Source furthes noted that
NADI put up the bond for FHANKLIN in that he, NADI, feels
that FiANKLIN is.a weak sister: and that he, NADI, has to .
protect himself.
