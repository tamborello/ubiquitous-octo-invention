RE: JOHN ROSELLI, aka
AR
00: LOS ANGELES

Re New York letter to Los Angeles dated 8/22/66,
7 setting forth information conceming JOHN ROSELLI by
NY 1839-C-TE.

‘ For more than 40 years ROSELLI has claimed he is
from Chicago and in 1936 filed a falsified delayed birth
certificate claiming birth in Chicago. In fact, he was
born in Italy; his true name is FILIPPO SACCO and he spent’
his childhood in Boston, Massachusetts.

 

The "uncle who was an old time Mafiosa" is no Pane
doubt ANTHONY D'ACUNTO, who died in Los Angeles in 1930.
D'ACUNTO was from New York and lived in Chicago in the early ‘
1900's. He was a bootlegger in Los Angeles when he and
ROSELLI became acquainted. ROSELLI claimed D'ACUNTO as an
uncle, but there is no relationship between the two.

 

 

The movie starlet who source stated corresponded
- with ROSELLI in Atlanta Penitentiary is no doubt BERNICE
' . ANN FRANK, who also visited ROSELLI in prison. Her brother
