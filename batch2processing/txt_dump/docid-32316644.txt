On October 7, 1862, the “Diario Las Americas,"
a daily Spanish language newspaper published in Miami,
Florida, contained an article stating that a series of
lectures had been organized by the National Democratic
Front (Triple A), headed by Aureliano Sanchez Arango.
The lectures were to be held at 433 W. Flagler Street
on October 8, 1962, at 8:30 P.M., and the speaker was to
‘Cruz, President of the Cuban Democratic

 

: Institute.” The’ subject of Azcuy's talk was to be "Posi-

tive and d Negative Aspects of Recruitment."

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
advised on November 8, 1962, that Aureliano Sanchez Arango,

“a politician and former Cuban Minister of Education, was

born June. 7, 1907, Havana, Cuba. The U. S. Embassy at
Caracas , Venezuela, refused him an immigrant visa because
of his membership in the Cuban Communist Party from Decem-
ber, 1930, to December, 1931. Sanchez seeks classification
as a defector in order to take up residence at 121 N. E.
16th Terrace, Ft, Lauderdale, Florida, with his wife, ~~

an organization now. in exile in the United. States. This
organization is in opposition to the government of Cuba,
and Sanchez is prominent and influential in political
groups. throughout Latin America which are friendly to the
United States and opposed to Communism. .

INS advised that the U. S. Department of State.
has found Sanchez to be a bona fide defector, and that his
entry into the United States would be in the public interest.

MM T-1, who has been active .in Cuban revolutionary
activities for the past six years, and who has furnished re-
liable information in the past, on October 22, 1962, advised
that Ovidi alich, 2633. Bay. View..Drive.,.Coral Ridge, Ft.
Lauderdale, F° Florida, was formerly an attorney in Havana,
Cuba, who is presently residing in exile in the United
‘States, and is a close friend and associate of Sanchez.

MM T-1 advised that Manalich had recently received a num-
ber of booklets from Caracas, Venezuela, and these booklets
were re-prints of a debate in which Sanchez, had participated.
These booklets were received by Manalich on about October 13,.

“1962, and were addressed to his residence.

MM T-1 advised that Sanchez Arango is a close
friend of Romulo Betancourt, the President of Venezuela,
and members of the Triple A say that on a recent trip to
Venezuela, Betancourt contributed $10,000.00 to Sanchez'

organization, but that Sanchez lost this money inadvertently

leaving it in some hotel where he stayed while en route.
