FOR THE RECORD
By Brig. Gen. Lansdale“

Subject: Operation Mongoose

John McCone asked me to call him on the gray telephone this
morning. I did so. He stated that he didn't know exactly how I was
supposed to get word on this, so he was informing me to help out:
at the Executive Council meeting this morning, tke President had
decided to hold back Operation Mongoose for the time being. Also,
during the negotiations re Soviet missile bases in Cuba, there were
to be no Mongoose sabotage or similar militant operations. McCone
said that he had informed General Carter of this, but was letting me
know, as Chief of Operations, to let the operations team know; he .
mentioned that Alpha 66 and the approved sabotage of Cuban shipping
were to be held, specifically.

I commented that I had just received a copy of a memorandum
from him to the Attorney General, the Sec/Def., etc., dated today,
saying that CIA wag_still awaiting word from me on sending in 20 lo
tearafby submarineffor intelligence collection, after I'd determined
JCS a fate. requirements. I said that I had been told by McGeorge
Bundy on Sunday, 28 October, to hold up action on this for 24 hours
and had promptly notified CIA, and that yesterday, upon receipt of a
memorandum from Bruce Cheever on this same subject, I had taken
it up again with Bundy -- and Bundy had told me that he would tell
McCone to have CIA hold everything. I presumed that Bundy had so
informed McCone. Also, Havey had called me Sunday night, asking
my permission to discuss CIA assets with CINCLANT and JUWTF
for contingency planning; I had given Harvey permission to assist
in this planning, if he felt that the U.S. military needed more planning
help from CIA.

After the talk with McCone, I talked with[Bruce Cheeverjwho
assured me that he had similar orders from Carter and tha militant
actions under CIA were being held at a stop. I gave similar orders to
General Johnson for Defense/JCS. Lt-Col Patchell concurrently
informed State and USIA along the same lines.
