JOE asked him what he meant by the "Syndicate".
By the "Syndicate" he explained, he meant gangsters. RUBY,
. he pointed cut, had many connections. Besides OSWALD's
case was too simple, too easy, He had defected to Russia,
married a Russian girl, was supposed to be active on a pro~Cuba
organization and had a picture taken with a gun and a rifle
with telescopic lens and a copy of The Worker.
