the back yard js clearly illuminated at night by several permanent
spot lights. GABRIEL MANNARING, his wife, JEAN, and their two

teenage daughters. occupy the house. -

Ag the Bureau hae been notified previously, GABRIEL MANNARINO's
eottage on Old Leechburg Road, im Allegheny Township, Westmoreland
County, Pa., is a one-story, frame building, which sits back
about 300 feet from the road on a 10 acre tract which slopes
from front to rear. It has a small lake in front Of it, and
_ it ig surrounded by wooded area. It hag 3 bedrooms, a
kLtche, @ living-dining room, and ¢ sereened porch, To the
_ Right rear\and about 20 feet from the ire pen, which
“ holds three German Sheperd degs. PCT who
lives nearby, gays there are no private telephone Jines in
the area, and it is knowh that the cottage has ao telephone.

From past experience, it le known that GABRIEL MANMARINO almost
never hes visitors at his home, especially those having

any connections with racket activities, polities, or lav
enforcement. SAMUEL MANNARINO occasionally has visitors of

the above types, but the visite ere se infrequent and unpredictable,
that 1s does net seem feasible tocensider establishing a highly
confidential source.

With regard to the MANNARING offices at 1963 Third Avenue,

New Kenaington, Pa., it is noted that thia is a ene story,

red brick building. It As Jocated completely inside a ten foot
metal fence which surrou the serap metal yard, and it sets
back from the gate, which is locked at night, about 50 feet.

The area between the gate, the serap piles and the office
building 1s brightly llluminated by a group of spotlights.
Recently, it has been determined that this office is protected
by the Sllent Service System, an electronic burglar alarm system
which is monitored directly by the New Kensington Pp.

it would seem that the most likely spot to attempt to establish
a bighly confidential source would be at the MANNARINO cottage,
bub efforts will have te be made to resolve some of the
problems, such ae monitoring (the eottage is about 35 miles
from the Pitteburgh Office); ingress (the dogs and a caretaker
whose schedule is irregular) and security (lecation and soverage
of all. possible visitors, and possibility that there is a
burglar-alarm installed).
