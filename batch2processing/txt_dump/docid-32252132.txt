game at Soldiers Field on November 2nd. whe “ap, Jap ygoneties.
I think they told us at the game, but we vs Sars ff
anyway," Motto said. "When I got back to the office, someone
said there had been threats," he told us. We pressed him for
information as to the identity of his informant, but he could
not recall who in his office told him. He does not recall
surveilling any Latin/Cuban types during that period, but he

does not rule out this possibility; he simply does not recollect.
The names Rodriguez and Gonzalez mean nothing to him.

Motto asked us if we had talked to Bolden yet. We
replied in the negative and asked him who Bolden was. He
launched into a vituperative discussion about Abe Bolden, the
Negro Secret Service Agent who allegedly attempted to blow
the whistle on the Service in 1964. He was arrested in Chicago
and charged with attempting to sell file information to a
counterfeiter who had been arrested by the Chicago office.

On the day President Kennedy was shot in Dallas, Motto
was in Cincinnati, Ohio, working on a big case. He said he
returned to Chicago and-helped in the post-assassination investiga-
tion -- but again he was vague on specifics.

Motto: said that he had a copy of the magazine article

he referred to earlier and would send it to us when he located it.
