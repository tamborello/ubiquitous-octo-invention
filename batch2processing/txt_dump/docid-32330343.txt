SUBJECT: ANTI-FIDEL CASTRO ACTIVITIES ‘
INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

 

Reference is made to your memorandum dated June 5, 1959, in
which you requested to be advised on an expedite basis when any of
the data furnished this Division concerning subject points to a
possible violation, if the facts were proved, of a law within the
jurisdiction of the Bureau. : 4 ;

 

The information furnished in a memorandum dated June 5, 1959 at
Washington, D.C. and captioned Anti-Fidel Castro Activities points to
a possible violation, if the allegations contained therein were proved
by competent and legally sufficient evidence, , .

a

 

. It appears from your memorandum that Rolando Arcadio Masferrer
“ Rojas, Justo Luis Pozo del. Puerto, and Pedro Diaz have entered into
an agreement which could constitute a conspiracy to violate Section
- 956, Title 18, United States Code, in that they appear to have agreed
to injure or destroy specific property situated in Cuba, It will,.
of course, be necessary to establish that the property to be destroyed
belongs to the Cuban Government or a political subdivision thereof,
or that it is a public utility. However, for the present, it is
assumed that such proof can be adduced because of the targets dis-
“ cussed, vizsy telegraph office, microwave station and teletypéhoffices *.

It does not appear that the e is sufficiegt evidence to link
Salvadory! ey, erson, Jose Tnsgujol, and RayfMolan to the Masferrer
conspivacy. /However, it does“appear they have agreed to attack- Cuba,

from the United States. If this is established and if an overt act
to effect the object of the conspiracy is committed, such as the
gathering together of individuals under such circumstances as to
make clear that they were about to engage in an expedition against
| Cuba from the United States, there could be a conspiracy to violate

Section 960, CubA Awd Fle
