a member of the Grand Jury or connected with the Grand
Jury. .He said he knew this to be a fact,

Then, for no reason at all, he told me that
he had just recently bought a new house in Grosse Pointe
from the builder and resold the house to .Mr. Bufalino, |
whom he identified as the head of the Teamster operations
in Detroit; and he did this as a-favor to Bufalino because
of the restrictive sales in the Grosse Pointe area wherein
Italians, Negroes, Jews, etc. aré very much discriminated
against and he wanted to do Bufalino a favor. He also
told me, "You know, there are 15 or 16 of the top mobsters
for the whole country right here in Detroit. They don't
do anything here in Detroit but do things all over the
country. Some are pretty close neighbors of mine."

Verhelle specifically brought up the fact that
it seemed inconsistent with Mr. Johnson's political past
that he should be making State of the Union speeches that
talk in tems of saving money ané cutting down on graft
and this sort of thing, and said, "This man of all people
to be talking like that." Actually, later at lunch,
Verhelle stated that a company that he, Verhelle, either
owns or partially owns just got a contract in Washington
that over a period of five years will run as high as
one billion dollars and this contract did not come fram
McNamara but was specifically given by Johnson to Verhelle's
partner in Washington. He called him a man that I've been
coaching, or my man that I've been coaching in Washington
went directly to Johnson and Johnson gave the contract to

us.

I asked Mr. Verhelle whether Triscaro could make
Dominick keep quiet. He said, "Heck no"; that apparently
it took someone much higher up and indicated Triscaro was
very ill and that he leoks terrible and when he saw him a
couple of weeks ago he was hesitant even to ask Triscaro
how he felt because hé. Looked so bad.

Just in general conversation - Recently when

Hoffa gave a talk to some businessmen (as much as maybe
six months ago) he impressed this group of businessmen,

attorney and a part of the contract negotiating team in
Chicago, lives three doors from Mr. Verhelle in Grosse
Pointe; and, according to Mr. Verhelle, always knows where-
ver Jimmy Hoffa is and what he is doing at any time and
that this is the way he would arrange the date. At another
part in the conversation we talked about the fact that
Verhelle would discuss the Chattanooga "fix" with just
Hoffa and the: top attorney who is representing Hoffa in
Tennessee, and Verhelle’s description of this attorney

was that he is a man from this area, this area being
Detroit, and in a sentence or two later mentioned the

name Haggerty. I assume this refers back to which of

these men is the attorney in charge.

Then I talked to Mr. Verhelle about the selfish
reason that I personally would have in wanting to help
Hoffa, which was to make sure that the Welfare Fund loan
for the purchase of the Sinclair Oil Building in Chicago
would in fact be approved and stated, on the other hand,
that the two didn't necessarily have to tie in together.
Then; momentarily, Mr. Verhelle assumed that I meant every-
one on the Welfare Fund Board should know about the "£ix"
in Tennessee and we straightened out the fact that these
would be private situations, although a favor in one place
could be returned in another place. I gave Mr. Verhelle
the financial data regarding the Sinclair Oil Building
sale, and he stated that he would talk to a couple of men
on the committee and would be in a position to move on
that matter as soon as he got to Chicago.

Mr. Verheile excused himself and upon returning

' suggested that we go into lunch, and I opened the luncheon

conversation by asking if he had seen the article in the
Cleveland newspaper about Dominick Bartone. He had not

seen it and was very interested in knowing on what charge
Dominick was being jailed and seemed very much relieved

that it was on a probation violation. He then told me

that he, Verhelle, had been told by someone in the Federal
offices in Detroit that Bartone could be convicted on income .
tax violation. Apparently this was someone who either was

Detroit, Michigan
January 10, 1964

Dictated by:

CO

I met Mr. Joseph Verhelle at the Detroit Athletic
Club at Mr. Verhelle's request at 11:00 A.M., January 10,
1964. Mr. Verhelle asked me to sit with him in the main
recéption hall-and. started the conversation by telling me
of some problems that the present Directors of the Public
Bank. are experiencing as a result of a four-page memorandum
which Mr. Verhelle preserited to the Directors yesterday.
The substance of the matter was that the Public Bank has
extended a rather unusual line of credit to a building
improvement firm, which manufactures screen doors and
similar items, and is now in trouble financially. Mr.
Verhelle has alerted the bank éxaminers, one of whom was
visiting Mr. Verhelle in Detroit today having come here
from Lansing. I asked Mr. Verhelle if he was going to
again take over the management of the Public Bank, and he
stated that he probably would and felt that most of the
present Directors would be resigning. He stated that the
Directors do not represent the owners of the bank and that
he, Verhellie, did. Mr. Verhelle also stated he had arranged
for five million dollars of additional equity to be put in
the bank and hence-make the bank solvent. I asked him, "Is
the money coming from Jimmy?", and he said, "Yes." I said,
"Will that be from the Pension Fund?", and he stated, "Yes,
it would come through one of the Pension Funds."

I then asked Mr. Verhelle if he had completed the
purchase of the bank that he told me he was buying in our
telephone conversation last week. He stated that he had
made the purchase and that his sons were making application
to move either one of the two banks that they now own to
Downtown Detroit. I tried to find out the name of the bank
which he has just purchased and was unsuccessful, but ke
told me that it was down near or in Wyandotte.

After Mr. Verhelle and I talked about Hoffa's
participation in the new banking operation, I then dsked
about Chattanooga. Mr. Verhelle told me that the trial
had just recently been moved down there and we diecusved

the fact that any trial in Tennessee would be a tough one
but that certainly Hoffa would have to win the one in
Tennessee if he expected to come through in Chicago. We
talked very specifically about the need for a "£ix" in
Tennessée and subsequently a “fix" in Ghicago, and I asked
Verhelle whether he still wanted me to try to be of any
assistance in Tennessee. He said yes and wanted to know
something about what could be done, and we talked about the
fact that if anything were done it would have to be done
way at the top of the State, talking specifically about
Governor Clements and oné of his personal assistants and
the fact that the politicians in Tennessee were very
"practical" people. He wanted to know how much money I
thought it would cost. “2 said at least a quarter of a
million dollars, and he said getting $2 or $300}000s isono
problem. He further wanted to know who would handle this,
and I said I would simply make an intreduction to someone.
He stated he felt Hoffa himself should not handle it, or
no one who is specifically a Teamster should handle it, and
it should be someone like himself and later talked in terms
of he, Joe Verhelle, taking care of the matter on Hoffa's
behalf.

He stressed in the conversation the need for not
giving my name to Hoffa and maintaining amn's length a
relationships all along the line. He also was concerned :
about how he might meet whoever it is that the arrangement
would be made with and, on the other hand, stated that,
"Well, I know how to handle this sort of thing", and he
would arrange a time and place where there wouldn't be
public record of their meeting, etc.

\

Then Mr. Verhelle talked about the fact that .
Jimmy Hoffa was not in Chicago today, and I think mentioned ,
that he might be here in Detroit. In any case, he specifically.
mentioned that two of the negotiators were here in Detroit |
today and he would meet with one of them and find out when |
he, Verhelle, should come to Chitage and discuss the Chatta-
nooga situation with Hoffa and indicated it would be within
the next three or four days, that he would call me and
arrange to meet with me in Chicago. The negotiator who is an
