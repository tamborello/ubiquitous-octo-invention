cash for the machines. -

MICHAEL MC LANEY, Miami Beach, Fla., a former
operator of the casino at Hotel Nacional, Havana, is inter-
ested in taking over the operation of the Wappen Von Hamburg,
if it can be done in a strictly legal manner and divorced
completely from any known hoodiums,

MM 509-C on 12/4/62, advised that on 12/3/62,
MICHAEL COPPOLA (Miami File 92-101) who has been out of
prison since 11/27/62, spent some time in the office of

COPPOLA there were, JIMMY COPPOLA, MASSER, JOE BOMMARITO
(Miami File 92-1445, ABE KAUFMAN, a bookmaker and friend
of GEORGE GORDON (Miami File 92-458) who was also there,
He also advised COPPOLA does not desire to hang out at any
of the present clubs or hangouts on Miami Beach and is seek-
ing a place where he can meet with his "Corp" and acquain-
tances. MM 509-C pointed out that ALLIE HARRIS, one of
the COPPOLA group, remained in New York City, where he
reportedly is running some floating dice games, but that
HARRIS' son, MEL HARRIS and his wife came to Miamt and are
staying at the Fontainebleau Hotel.

MM 509-C also advised AL ROTH (Miami File 162-36)
was interested in acquiring the quarters presently controlled
by the Business Men's Association at Miami Beach when there
was a rumor this association was disband. The informant
learned the association is going to continue at least for
another year and ROTH's desire to acquire the quarters failed.

This source also advised that RUTH GASSENHEIMER,
operator of the Patio Bridge Club, which is the largest hang-
out for the hoodlum element at Miami Beach, inaugurated a
new policy at the Club, whereby all individauls who bet on
the card game or bet on the card player must pay the reguhar
ecard game fees. This policy he related has caused some iil
feeling and some of the hoodlums are seeking other places to °
hang out.
