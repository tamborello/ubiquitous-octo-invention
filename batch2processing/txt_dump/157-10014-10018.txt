Mr. Bundy» ’ phat is what I don't know. I cannot
vecollect who it was. And I think it inapproprate to guess
when I have no recollection.

Mr. Schwarz. What time? I don't mean what time of day,
but what time?

Mr. Bundy. As I say, sometime I think in the early
months of 1961. And searching memory is an uncertain busi-
ness, but it sticks in my mind that I heard about it in the
rooms of the Executive Office Building. And that
would place it in time, because I moved from .the Executive
office Building to the West Basement of the White House sometim
after the Bay of Pigs, perhaps in May.

Mr. Schwarz. So based on that fact you place it in
time sometime prior to the Bay of Pigs and sometime after--

Mr. pundy - After my arrival in Washington.

Mr. Schwarz. And when did you arrive in Washington?

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Bundy. About the loth of January. I would place
ae more closely, because I think it was after I was in the
office of the Special Assistant, which, of course, was occupied
until the 20th of January by others.

Mr. Schwarz. So you place it after the 20th of January,
hut before the Bay of Pigs, which was April 14 or 17?

Mr. Bundy. That is right.

Mr. Schwarz. pia it come up in a context where you
—

urged that such a capacity be created?

schwarz. What context did it come up in?

Mr. Bundy. It came up ina context in whieh it was being
described to me by someone else. Anc that is really about
as far as I can take it with precision.

Mr. Schwar2- WAs it described to you by someone else
as a capacity in being?

Mr. Bundy. As a capacity “7 and this is not something
t want to be too certain about, Mr. Schwarz, but my recollec-
tion would be that it was a capacity coming into peing.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, receiving that information, did you
take any steps to discourage or dissuade the person, whoever
it was, who was describing to you the capacity coming
into being?

Mr. Bundy. what I recollect is that I was satisfied with
the description T received on two points.
pirst, that this was not an operational activity, and

would not become guch without two conditions: first, that

there be 4 desire or 4 request or 2 guidance that there

should be planning against some specific individual; and
second, that there should be 4 decision to move against an
individual.

Being satisfied that these two things were not happen-
ing 7-7 and I am now giving you a reconstruction rather than

a precise recollection ~~ t am confident that what 1 did was

Mr. Schwarz. Would you distinguish, though, the part

that is recollection and the part that is based upon other
matters?

Mr. Bundy. That is exactly what I would like to do.

The part that is recollection is very vague. And I
would say that I have no recollection of more than one conver-
sation on this subject. And the impression that sticks in
my mind is that I was told about it ina general way. “and
it was described to me as an effort to study through the
possibilities by which one might act against an individual
in a context other than that of espionage and counter-espionage,
a context more political.

Mr. Schwarz. When you say “act against an individual",
act in what fashion?

Mr. Bundy. Act in a variety of fashions, as I recollect
it, but up to and including killing the individual.

The two things that I think are clear in my recollection
about that -- three -- one, that it was a concept presented
or described to me -- I was in effect being briefed on it.

two, that it was entirely an untargetted -- that it
was in no sense a plan to do anything to anyone.

And third, and I think quite important, that it was
not anoperation which had any specific target.

Mr. Schwarz. You said you were in effect briefed on it.

By whom?

Administration came in, at which time he moved over to the

Defense Department.

Mr. Schwarz. We have indicated to you that we are going
to discuss the countries of Cuba, the Dominican Republic and
Vietnam, although not much on vietnam. And the majority and
minority staff have shown you some documents of that period,
some 15 years ago. Before I get to those three countries,

Y would like to ask you some questions about a subject
called Executive Action. Have you ever heard of the subject
called Executive Action?

Mr. Bundy. Yes, I have.

Mr. Schwarz. When did you first hear of it?

Mr. Bundy. well, as I have told your staff, that is a real
difficulty for me, because I cannot pinpoint the time at
which I heard of it. My impression was that it was some time
in the early months of 1961.

Mr. Schwarz. And do you have a recollection as to the
context in which you heard about it, the person from whom you
heard about it, and will you provide to the Committee your

full recol’ection of the subject of Executive Action in the

| early 19613?

Mr. Bundy. Would it help if I try to describe in a
general way what I now understand of this matter, the
part which is recollection and the part which is clarified

by discussions with the staff and what I now think about it?
