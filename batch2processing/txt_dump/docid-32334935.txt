to the Police Department and would not be passed to other agencies.
This statement is also subject to misinterpretation and we are
advising SAC, Tampa, to be sure that Chief Brown understands that
information concerning the public safety of the community would be
given to him and to other. interested agencies.

OBSERVATIONS:

If leaders and principal members of the Tampa Bay Chapter
of FPCC are to be Subpoenaed by the Subcommittee, it would be to our
advantage and that of TP 27-S to be subpoenaed along with the other~- i
members as his absence would undoubtedly pinpoint him to the member-
ship as an informant. Appropriate action concerning the issuance
of a subpoena for TP 27-S will be made when list of witnesses available

RECOMMENDATIONS: |

If you agree,

  
 
 
 
 

(1) Contact will be maintained by Mr. DeLoach's office
with Subcommittee representative in order that list of witnesses might
be obtained and appropriate action concerning the issuance of a
subpoena concerning TP 27-S taken. pu)

(2) Attached airtel will be sent to Tampa advising that

| of hearings not set nor list of witnesses completed and that appro-
priate action concerning subpoena will be taken when list of witnesses t
is available. Also, that Chief Brown understands that information in

| FBI files is only furnished to authorized Government agencies and that
information concerning public welfare of the community. would be
disseminated to him, along with interested Government agencies.
