Serafin, Jr. (NR), John Alastanas (NR), Charles E. Larck (1940),
Lucien Edward Ball (NR), John Dallas (NR), Martin Frey (NR), Jack
Penley (NR), Walter J. Burls (NR), and Charlotte K. Bruns (NR).
The ARRB sustained the postponement of PCI William H. Reed (L)
until August 2006.

The ARRB opened the afternoon session of their 8/6/96
meeting to the public. At this session, Mr. Steve Tilley of the
National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provided an
update on the different federal agency's transferral of documents
to NARA. Mr. Tilley reported that the FBI had made three
transfers since his last public report. Mr. John Pereira and
Mr. Barry Harrelson of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
presented a sworn statement concerning the CIA's sequestered
House ‘Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) records. The CIA
statement was a historical depiction of the collection,
documentation and sequestering of their HSCA records.

The ARRB's General Counsel T. Jeremy Gunn provided an
overview of the problems associated with the review of HSCA
records. The CIA's HSCA records were collected based on the
names of individuals requested by the Committee. Mr. Gunn
presented several issues related to the review of the material,
such as there is no documentation concerning the theories
surrounding the requests, so it is very difficult to determine
relevancy to the matter. He made suggestions for guidelines for
the review of the material and the determination of the relevance
of the material. The ARRB provided a time frame until September
15, 1996 for the public to send the ARRB their comments on this
issue.

Should the ARRB Board accept their staff's
recommendations, the guidelines will be applied to their review
of the FBI's HSCA documents. However, if the public requests the
ARRB to have the FBI respond to the matter of its HSCA records or
the Board accepts different guidelines, which cannot easily be
applied to the FBI's records, the FBI may be requested to present
a sworn statement concerning its HSCA records.

The ARRB staff suggested guidelines are:

1. The ARRB staff reviews all records and files in the HSCA
collection. ‘

2. The documents determined to be relevant by the staff will

have the postponements reviewed word by word by the Board, as was
done in the core files.

Re: (U) 62-HQ-1029205, 08/19/1996

3. The files determined not to be relevant by the staff will be

described in a memorandum identifying the file and describing the
review process and the explanation as to why the document is not

relevant.

4. The files having some documents which are relevant to the
assassination will receive a word by word review of the
postponements by the Board for the relevant portion and a memo as
described in #3 for those not relevant documents.

5. Any files on microfilm which have not already been processed
will be reviewed word by word.

6. In files which only a portion of the document is relevant
that particular portion could be released and the irrelevant
matter could be redacted.

When the ARRB provides their guidance to their staff,
the JFKTF will advise OGC as to what impact this may have on the
FBI.

confidential sources (CS) and established sources.

(U) The 59 documents pertaining to the decisions from
the current meeting, which the FBI may wish to appeal, are listed
below by document number with the information to be released.

The current status of informants and sources, if found through
research, is noted after the name with living (L), deceased (D),
no record (NR) or date of birth (DOB).

(U) The FBI provided written justifications presenting
the evidence available to protect the individuals, singular
information, technical information, classified information
related to methods, sources, and foreign relations as listed
above: However, the ARRB supports the position that the
information ordered disclosed is relevant and significant to the
assassination and that it outweighs any harm that would be caused
to the individuals or the FBI's/United States Government's
foreign relations, informants, or operational aspects which they
voted to disclose.

(U) If CID or NSD recommend appeal, they are requested
to provide their opinion and reasons to the JFKTF and OGC by
