Davidson referred to his previous discussion, wherein he os
he had been holding the Dominican Republic off on the purchase of arms |
which he figured are to be used in an invasion of Cuba. He said he had
learned, as a matter of fact, that on 6/2, a BC-4 airplane stopped at
Bermuda with a load of "farm machinery" en route to the Dominican
Republic. A check of the plane by authorities at Bermuda showed that
it was loaded with machinegums, rather than farm machinery. The
authorities held it for 20 hours and then let it proceed to its
destination. Last Friday, 6/5, another DC~4 carried a like load of
"farm machinery" and was allowed to proceed to the Dominican Republic.
Davidson saic that the same thing will happen tomorrow, 6/9. y

Ke said that these pc-48 are carrying arms purchased in Italy

and are being flown by US pilots (for hire) from Italy to the Dominican
Republic, He said the planes are controlled by a Brussels, Belgium

Davidson said also that he was in New York over the veekend
and had talked to some Dominicans and some Cubans, and conditions MI
are getting so bad in Cuba that it cam well be that a counterrevolutica,
will occur from within Cuba, rather than waiting for any invasion ore,
