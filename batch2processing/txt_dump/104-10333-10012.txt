SEQUESTERED COLLECTION

First of all, every document in the sequestered
collection is available to the Board for review. The
documents are available in full, without redactions.

The record shows that the sequestered collection
consists of documents compiled in connection with the
investigation of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA).

A portion of the documents were created specifically in
response to requests from the HSCA. Other records were
already in existence prior to the creation of the Committee.
Still other documents were created by the Committee itself.
For example, notes of interviews conducted by the
Committee's staff.

Within the sequestered collection there are two major
categories of records. One category consists of
approximately 129,000 pages of hard copy. The second
category consists of 72 reels of microfilm, or the
equivalent of 163,000 pages of hard copy.

The reason why the documents were sequestered is
explained in a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the
Chairman Louis Stokes of the HSCA and DCI Stansfield Turner
in August 1977. The Memorandum provides as follows:

‘Upon termination of the Committee, all materials
provided by CIA and examined by the Committee will be kept
and preserved within a segregated and secure area within CIA
for at least 30 years unless the DCI and the House of
Representatives agree to a shorter period of time.”

In April 1979, Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff
Director of the HSCA visited CIA Headquarters to complete
the process of designating what materials were to be
sequestered. All the documents made available to the
Committee were included in the sequestered collection.

REVIEW AND DECLASSTFICATION OF THE SEQUESTERED FILES

In 1992, CIA wrote to Speaker of the House Thomas Foley
requesting approval to begin declassifying and releasing the
records. In October of that year, Mr. Foley wrote a letter
to the DCI granting CIA the authority to do so. The
Speaker's decision was made in anticipation of passage of
the Assassination Records Collection Act.

THE HARDCOPY MATERIAL

The hardcopy part of the sequestered collection
includes copies of most of the CIA documents in the Oswald
201 file. Also included are 201 files, personnel files, and
security files on persons who are mentioned in documents
relevant to the assassination, or who figure in one of the
conspiracy theories.

The collection also includes about 30,000 pages of
documents, memos, and notes (many handwritten) that were
created by the Committee staff @during their investigation.
 

THE ASSASSINATION RECORDS

In identifying relevant records, we have followed the
definitions in the 1992 Act and the related rules which were
published in the Federal Register.

The Kennedy assassination records in CIA consist of two
major groups of files. One group consists of the documents in
the Lee Harvey Oswald file--sometimes referred to as the “Oswald
201 file”. These consist mainly of documents collected after the
assassination and during the Warren Commission investigation.

There are about 26,000 pages of material in the Oswald
file. All but a handful have been declassified and sent to the
National Archives.

The second group is comprised of the “sequestered
collection”. These are the records that were made available to
the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and which the
Committee asked CIA to hold in safekeeping upon the completion
of the Committee’s investigation.

Certain additional records, including 400 excerpts from
minutes of the Director’s morning meetings, and some working
files, have been added to the overall collection since 1992.

TESTIMONY BEFORE JFK BOARD, 6 AUGUST 1996

 

INTRODUCTION
Introduce CIA participants

We are pleased to provide information to the Assassination
Records Review Board that might assist the Board in fulfilling
, its responsibilities under the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act. CIA is committed to full
cooperation with the Board.

Before addressing the subject of the sequestered collection
directly, I would like to provide some background to help put
the sequestered collection into some sort of context.

In the spring of 1992, prior to the enactment of the JFK
Assassination Records Act, then Director of Central
Intelligence, Bob Gates issued instructions to begin reviewing
for declassification all records related to the assassination.

The CIA History Staff was charged with identifying the
relevant records. Once this was done, the Historical Review
Group took custody of these records and immediately began
reviewing them for declassification for release to the National
Archives.

Once the Kennedy Assassination Records Act was passed, our
goal became to release as many of the records as possible by the
22 August 1993 deadline established by the Act. Approximately
125,000 pages were transferred to the National Archives by that
date.

With subsequent releases, CIA has now declassified and
transferred some 227,000 pages of material to the National
Archives. Based on discussions with the Board, we are
continuing to release additional information that had been
redacted earlier.

The remaining records are in various stages of review.
Some require review by other agencies. Some is congressional
material. Final decisions on other records are awaiting
discussion with the Review Board.
