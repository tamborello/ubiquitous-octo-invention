the assassination of President Kennedy.

2. The interview was conducted by Messrs Kenneth Klein and
Gary Cornwell and was held in secure spaces provided by Mr, George
Murphy, Director of the Senate National Security Office. Both
individuals are authorized SI access.

.3. The interview was conducted under terms of a Memorandum .
of Understanding executed between the Committee and OSD on 15 Nove ember,
' 1978 (copy attached). :

4. For purposes of the interview, DoD made available Sgt.

Christensen at USA-55, Kirknewton, Scotland, in 1963. Sgt. Stevenson
was accompanied by LTC Jeffrey Graham, USAF, Air Force Legislative

6. Sgt. Stevenson briefly described the USA~-55 site
mission and confirmed that the link mentioned in
Mr. Christensen's letter could have been intercepted by the site
but, to his knowledge, had not been an assigned target. Regarding
the specific allegations made by Mr. Christensen that he had per-
sonally intercepted communications relating to the President's
assassination, Sgt. Stevenson emphatically stated that he had no
knowledge of such an event, though in all likelihood, if it had .
occurred, it would have been widely known within the station ané@

report, for purposes of classification, on or after 20 November 1978.

9. The staffe remain particularly interésted in determini

the name of the individual who Mr. Christensen believes relates to.
the assassination. They will explore means of determining this

call Christensen and ask him for the identity (Stevenson indicated
his extreme unwillingness to do this. LTC Graham stated that this
request would have to be examined at policy level within DoD).

10. If the Committee is able to determine a specific name
the staffers indicated that they would vrobably initiate a specific
