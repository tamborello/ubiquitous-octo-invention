Possibilities of obtaining desired information by other means
(Explain in. detail):

TP 41-PCI, whose identity is known to the Bureau and who is close
to subject and the Tampa rackets, has advised that. subject was
last contacted by him on August 29, 1961, at which time subject
said he was going to Miami. Therefore 41-PCI cannot. ascertain
subject's exact whereabouts. TP 50-PCI, whose identity is known
to the Bureau and who is close to subject and a part of the bolita
racket, has advised that subject went back to Miami, and subject,
being more or less competitive if in bolita, would not necessarily
reveal his operation to this source.

Even though the Tampa Office has two top flight potential criminal
informants, additional coverage is needed to not only substantiate
these sources but to keep advised as to subject's whereabouts,
movements and activities.

Risks of detection involved:

Spot surveillances of the Dream Bar conducted in the past have
established that the bar is open from approximately 10:00 a.m. to
3:30 a.m., that the bar cannot serve alcoholic beverages after
3:00 asm. but that patrons continue to stay until approximately .-
3:30 a.m. FANO TRAFFICANTE and the night bartender sometimes :
spend up to an hour working about the bar, and when leaving turn
on all lights and raise the venetian blinds. There is a very short.
period of secure working time in the bar before the steady flow of
business traffic, as Nebraska Avenue is a main thoroughfare into
Tampa proper, and a number of entries may be necessary. In addition,
a fire at the bar was recently reported and verified. NICK SCAGLIONE
