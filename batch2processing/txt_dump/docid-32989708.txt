Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62~116464

if he did, he wanted Magee to return to the Bureau to serve
as Assistant Director in the Laboratory. The tenor of
Magee's remarks was that he thoughtSullivan was talking
rather wildly in making such a job offer to him and that
this applied as well to the idea of Sullivan becoming FBI
Director.

RECOMMENDATION :

None. For information and record purposes.

KE 8-5249, telephonically advised me that he had been summoned by the
House Select Committee to appear for a deposition at 3:00 p.m. on
Monday, December 15, 1975. He said that he was requesting the appoint-
ment of counsel to assist him at the deposition and he specifically asked
that Bryan Gettings. be designated as his counsel.

On Monday, December 15, 1975, I spoke with Thomas Martin,
Special Assistant to the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,
at 10:26 a.m. and advised him of Mr. Mohr's appointment for the deposition
with the House Select Committee and of his request to have Bryan Gettings
designated as counsel. Mr. Martin said that he would confer with ;
Assistant Attorney General Lee concerning the request, but he was
certain that Mr. Gettings could be designated to assist Mr. Mohr in this
matter.

obtained from the personnel files and furnished to Supervisor
P. Y. Daly of the Legal Counsel Division on the morning of
1/2/76 so that he might orally advise the HSC of the current
whereabouts of Magee and Gormley, Prior to furnishing of
information to Daly, Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the ©
Senstudy 75 Project had telephone conversations with both
Magee and Gormley, also on the morning of 1/2/76, for the
purpose of alerting them to the HSC interest and with the
suggestion that, if they are contacted, they might call the
Legal Counsel Division for further assistance. Both indicated .
that they would take such action and expressed appreciation f :

\) for being alerted in advance. In addition, Magee advised of __/{..:

Re: Houstudy 75

quite busy and would not be able to see him immediately.
The only information Epstein gave as to the reason for
wanting to interview Magee was to get information about the
early organization of the FBI Laboratory. There followed
some further telephone calls between the two but they never
got together for an interview at that time, However,
Epstein again called Magee early during the week of 12/28/75
and asked Magee to appear for interview Tuesday, 1/6/76.

The only information Epstein gave as to the subject matter
of the interview was that it would be about the operations
of the Bureau. Magee agreed to appearing for the interview.

It was explained to Magee that the same procedure
relative to an SSC interview would apply as that for one of
the HSC, and it was suggested that immediately after completing
the conversation with Phillips, Magee telephone the Legal
Counsel Division for further information, particularly as
to waiver of the confidentiality agreement he has with the
Bureau. Magee said that he would immediately call
Mr, Mintz' office,

AS a matter of interest, Magee also advised that,
when he was first contacted by Epstein September last, he
asked Epstein where the latter had gotten his name and
Epstein said it was from Bill Sullivan. Magee then told
Phillips that he could just not undérstand some of the things
which he has been learning about Sullivan and he expressed
dismay at some publicized reports that Sullivan had been
making statements derogatory to the Bureau and the late
Mr. Hoover, Magee said that at the time former Acting
Director L. Patrick Gray left the Bureau, and before
Mr, William D. Ruckelshaus was named to succeed him,
Sullivan contacted Magee. Sullivan told Magee that he,
Sullivan, fully intended to become FBI Director and that,
