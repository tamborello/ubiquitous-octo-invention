moe . project, the actual payments made by Mexico City
Station per the terms of each Memorandum of Oral
Commitment (MOC) and in accordance with Mexican

law and custom exceeded the estimate for termination
costs made by Headquarters at the time the Amendment
was requested, Termination payments made to each
agent are as follows: ‘

AMPACTOR-2. (Recruited 1956) $8,160
MGEACTOR-5 (Recruited 1956) 2,366
MEACTOR-6 - (Recruited 1956) 2,830

agents, the relatively high monthly salary of

Gay ACTOR? 2 ($440) plus the computation of the

. rmination payments in accordance with Mexican
law and custom were the primary reasons that the
final agent termination costs amounted to $15,573.

i : 5. All agent terminations were accomplished
in an amicable manner. No.visible security risks
were apparent at the time of the terminations
although any one, or all, of the terminated agents
may at some future date decide to divulge to an
interested party the details of the sMFACTOR Project
\ . operations. @@WFACTOR-2, ¢ MFACTOR-5S, and <aNBACTOR-6
have worked in’photo surverllance operations for
the Station since 1956 and, therefore, obviously
have considerable knowledge of targets, former
safesites, personnel, and modus operandi of the
Station. However, since the ggyrACTOR Project was
not concerned with incompatible operations or
targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station
relations with the Mexican Government in the event
of exposure of the g@WFACTOR Project operations by a
terminated agent aré within acceptable limits.

6. It is requested that the

and two baschouse surveillance sites under this

project.
