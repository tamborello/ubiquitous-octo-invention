exists considerable > oppertunt ty for activity in
Hollywood. Our payments per month, aside from
overhead, amount to over 2650.00 and the help of
Hollywood is decidedly needed in raiding this quota.
I indicated that discussion was still going on son-
cerning basic pointe of the Hollywood report end i
“think I can prophesy that basic pointe of the Holly-
waod report will be adopted as our policy. It
coincides with mugh that was already said hore that
was nob reflected in any official communication. Ono
misgiving about the report is that some of the members
are not entirely convinced that Hollywood intende to |
continue activity in a serious way, the bagis for,
this belief is that so far we hive seen no dues from
ilollywood. What is Hollywood doing about that problem?

    
  
  
 

Im your letter of December 22nd you avked what our
policy was of collaboration with other refugee come
wittees. Wo are not at present engaged in any joint
projeat. We were considering taking part in a joint
projest at the outbreak of the war but withdrew on the
following ground: (1) that the collaboration tended
to inerease our obligations to a great extent and
without any certainty that income would kowep pace
with our obligations. (2) that collaboration in the
past had had the offeet of eutting down the amount
of money we might have had had we run them alone.
(3) that the possibility of using funds for the
transportation of refugee writers from France has
practically ceased to exist.”

It would appear that this letter was in the neture of a
directive and statement ofthe continuing policy of the League of:
American Writers, since it is noted that FRED RINALNO, member of
the Hollywood Chapter, appeared at the Communist Party Sponsor
World Forum, 2200 West 7th Street, Los Angeles on Sunday, January
18, 192 and lectured on the subject "Hollywood and the World.”
This is the first sereen writer to appear on this forum since it , {
| started some months ago. Further cooperation of the local shapter .
| and the relation of subject ANSON to the I.L.D., the I.W,0, and

the Refugee | Writer Groups will be followed in this investigation Wy

. The attention of the Bureau ie further invited to the
: report of CHDI'LA #2021 dated January 3, 1912, which advises thet :
MN tiie informant has received information from e confidentiel reliable |
_ - gouree te the effeat that there is a steady flow of subversive deta
n and information from Mexico City to New York and return, This ine
