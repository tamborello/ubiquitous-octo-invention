to handle PECORA under the Top Echelon Criminal Informant
Program that it would be much more feasible to attempt to
obtain Misur coverage. He participated in the surveillances
which were necessary to determine whether Misur coverage
was possible and conducted discreet investigation in the
area which determined the identities of persons frequenting
the court whose activities would be of value in the event
of a successful installation, He also participated in the
all night physical surveillance on the court and the indi-
-viduals whose activity must be accounted for at the court
prior to attempting the installation,

SA JOHN M, DUFFY is recommended for a letter
of commendation inasmuch as he obtained a room at the a
tourist court under a suitable pretext, was able to determine
the identities of a number of individuals residing at the
court and the fact that coverage at this court offered good
potential. He was able to obtain an apartment overlooking
the office which apartment afforded excellent coverage during
the time the actual installation took place. It is felt
that without this coverage the installation would not have
been possible.

Field Supervisor JOHN T, REYNOLDS is recommended
for a letter of commendation inasmuch as the possibilities
of the installation at this location were under his personal
supervision from the time they were first suggested, This
matter was under close personal supervision during the entire
period of the survey and during the actual installation.
