3. Mr. Adam ZOLIEK, Chief Accountant, PRINCIPAL
INVESTUENTS, 133 Richmond Street, W., Toronto, Ontario P:
informed me that he has been acquainted with PULLMAN in .
‘a business-like manner from 195 to 1959."Due to his. te
keen interest in women, I doubt the rumour that he is: ~
married", ZOLIEK stated that there is no reason why his. fe
honesty or integrity may be doubted. PULLMAN is associated |
with: PRING ESTMENTS as a result of being a share- |
holder of three buildings with this Company. The first ;
building is located at 2747 Bloor Street, W., Toronto, =}
The known shareholders of this building are as follows; - .
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS -1/3, John PULLMAN -1/6, L, CHESLER » a
1/6, Ann COWAN (nee PULLMAN)-1/6 and CHILLOW - 1/3. It 4
is believed that CHILLOW is a Trust Fund for John PULLMAN ' 3: |
nephews and was originally owned by John PULLMAN. The a
cheques for CHILLOW are forwarded to the Canada Trust ty
Building, 903, ¢/o Henry JUFFY, Windsor, Ont. An average i
of $1,000 per month is received by PULLMAN as a result of,
the shares owned in this building. He is also 1/4 share-./ |,
holder of STRADBROOKE ARCADE LTD., 135 Yonge St. Toronto / . |.
and has an annual income from this building of $7,500. of
Other shareholders are PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS 1/2 yand - :
COWAN (brother-in-law) 1/4, It was also established that —
he is 1/3 owner of BEXLEY COMPANY LTD., Toronto and is
receiving an annual income from this source of $5,000
COWAN (brother-in-law) and PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS are
equal shareholders in investment. The mortgage which :
is held by the aforementioned shareholders in the three.
buildings would be approximately $200,000. At this point, . f°
ZOLIEK informed me that PULLMAN's portion of the above = ~ |:
revenue which is payable by cheque is mailed to A.C.
- | COWAN (brother-in-law). In view.of the discreet inqui- ~
| ries recommended in this case, I-was unable to establish ...
whether or not the above cheques are forwarded to wee pt
*| PULLMAN, ZOLIEK confirmed the fact that A.C. COWAN is” en
in the Insurance Business and is quite wealthy. It was a ae
noted that PULLMAN was previously employed by COWAN ad
and COLLINS INSURANCE BROKER which at that time was .
situated at 133 Richmond St., W., Toronto, Ont. During
this acquaintance I was informed thet PULLMAN also a
Operated the THEATRE on Centre Island, Toronto in 1954.°—
As a result of the expropriation of this THEATRE, no ;
further details were available.
