something Constructive. This Gill. recently, a few years
or less ago Made a trip to the Soviet Union ete on the
Youth Conference Know as the ‘World ‘Youth Conference.'

He will probably emerge from the ‘New York thing. as’ a-
full time. organizer ‘in some: special field suchas. youth,

At the start of the: Meeting Genne brought out
her brief case full of clipbiiigs (Newspaper) etc she
also had a lot of pemciled notes which she was

undoubtedly going to use to show what she was doing
.and.to give others hell for not co-operating with her.

i But the first discussion by A, Johnson centered around
the late Pres. Kennedy.

Arnold explained that since Oswald was Considered a
Comaunist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode
against the C, party of America but by the time the
re-actionarles were getting started it was announced
that it had been disclosed that it seemed like the
extreme eight had been active. This was bore out .

by the declaration of Russia that it was not the

Cc. party that had done it because Kennedy was a

friend of the Working class but the work of the extreme
right or almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober
the masses that it was the same caliber of people who
had insulted Stevenson only Weeks, before in Dallas,
Texas.

Arnold stated he was asked by €.B.S. News about this
Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he
told them he gets lets of letters of enquiry about the
C. party and he probak ly answered it as he does hundreds
of others and even sent him literature if he requested .
it. They (C.B.S.)} wanted him to go on the air with 4
statement but he stated to them he would have to dig the"
letter out and-be sure before he Made any statement. |
Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson if when he got back to
New York to look in the files if he had a letter from 4
Wm Pokas, formerly from Bellaire, Ohio, and also an

asked Johnson to compare the letter of ‘Pokey's with:
Oswald's-to see if they. didn't have a lot: in Common.
Palmer stated that he thought the’ statement by’ the
Methodist Minister: Covered ‘the situation very good —
when he stated that the fact that the Murder of Bill
Moore, M Edgar Evers and others in’ the, south going
by without punishment had set the stage for the ©
Assassination of Pres. Kennedy. Everyone weadily
agreed, :

Arnold Johnson further stated that no real Marxist
Could do such a thing. There is not Much doubt that
since the Soviet Union had expelled him by not _
giving him a Citizenship in the Soviet: Union because
they thought him to be an Agent of Fascism, Genne °
Meanwhile was Chomping at the bit trying to get her
story told about the N.A.A.C.P. and CORE, . :

\

She finally got her Chance to unload.

She stated that about the time of the Civil Rights
March on Washington a few days before she had been
working with CORE and NAACP the reporter from the
Wheeling paper Intelligencer had Called and wanted
te talk about her, She gave him answers on the
phone and finally hung upon him. from the time
this phone conversation was completed she had been
quoted in the newspaper and exposed as a Communist
party Member, which brought about her expolsion from
the N.A.A.C.P., but simce has been restored to
Membership. Then lately a Man (Negro) by name of. Johnson
head of the local CQRE group was indicted for robbing .a
bus driver in Steubenville, Ohio. Genne had got in
touch with R. Gorby as she thought Johnson was being

' framed. Gorby found out and told her at this Meeting
that he had did the robbing and was Not being framed.

' The best thing to do stated Gorby was to give him
help but do not put’ CORE. and the NAACP out. om a limb |
by doing it. . ; a
