memoranda should not be made available, the Deputy Attorney General om
decided and instructed that the 39 page report should be made available a
to John Elliff on Tuesday, June 3, 1975, for his review, at which time he 4
would be permitted to take notes, but he would not be furnished a copy of 4
the document. The Deputy further instructed that should Mr. Elliff reques
