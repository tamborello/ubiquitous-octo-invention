tion, and that he thought HM should have a list of Justice
Department personnel in this area. SULLIVAN did not say that

Re DAVID EUGENE PARSONS

DN T-/ advised on November 2, 1964, that DAVID EUGENE
PARSONS, 10882 Mildred Drive, Northglenn, Colorado, and an
electric troubleshocoter for Public Service Company (PSC), is
connected with the -"Minutemen" (MM) organization.

PARSONS brought this source some MM literature to read
and said that former Admiral ARLEIGH BURKE was the head of
MM. PARSONS said that MM was an organization which would
step in and defend the United States if the communists took
over the U. S. Government. PARSONS indicated there were
other members of the MM in the PSC working out of that
particular warehouse on West 7th Avenue in Denver.

PARSONS told this source that he should make application
for MM and, if he did so, to go on November 4, 1964, to a
public telephone booth located at 1180 South Colorado Boulevard,
next to the "Leaning Tower of Pizza" restaurant. The source
was to enter the telephone booth at 8:30 P.M. and when the
telephone rang the source was to answer it and identify himself,
at which time an unknown individual would ask him certain
questions and take his applifation for MM. PARSONS explained
that it was necessary to be very secretive about MM in view
of the fact they have been criticized by many individuals.

DN T-/ on November 22, 1964, advised that PARSONS stated
he, PARSONS, had been recruited into the MM by DAVID LUDVIGSEN,
a repairman in the Plants Department of the PSC. PARSONS said
that LUDVIGSEN has a police record and, therefore, was able. to
avoid the draft. PARSONS stated he had been trying to get
GEORGE SULLIVAN and JIM BAKER, both employees of the PSC, to
show an interest in the MM organization, PARSONS stated that
both SULLIVAN and BAKER had been instructed to go to the tele-
phone booth, as source had been instructed to do. PARSONS
stated that he himself was being advanced from a courier to a
contact man in the MM organization. PARSONS stated that he
had learned the group was going to be issued a kit which included

_, an M-1 carbine rifle, a field pack and hunting knife.
