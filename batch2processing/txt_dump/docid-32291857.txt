veillances in Cuernavaca at Rancho Tetela, the golf club, and
tourist centers with negative results. :

Mr . HARRY, WRIGHT advised that he had discreetly

retired and who plays golf daily at Cuernavaca to the possibility

of subject's presence at cerns glub there. He. said that

office, inquired as to the subject's whereabouts. He~-was
advised: that we had no information at this time as to sub- .
ject's exact whereabouts. He was curious to know the results
of the information previously furnished by nean area ef
