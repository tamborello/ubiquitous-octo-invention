"SQUARE WORLD LIBERTARIAN FRONT), RM - WHITE HATE GROUP;"

Chicago letter to Les Angeles,/dated 12/24/70 (interoffice);

and Tampa letter to Los Angeles, dated 2/25/71 (interoffice).

Character in this matter has been changed from RM - WHITE

HATE GROUP to IS - MISC as this more nearly seems to describe

subject organization. As noted below, the group appears to

be a "paper organization," and there is no indication its

aims are in the nature of a white hate group, rather it is .

to be notéd that its organizer ED BUTLER has featured a (AAI
see sae

Le ReBulet to Los Angetes, dated 12/24/70 captioned,

rock musical group, th ns of Liberty, comprised of a

Negro, Indian, Oriental, Irishman, Jew, Italian, and a Mexican,
which on its very facé would. tend to indicate it could not

be a white hate group.

There are enclosed for the Bureau's information,
six copies of a letterhead memorandum (LHM) concerning
captioned matter. : This LHM is classified Confidential because
the unauthorized disclosure of information furnished ‘by
‘Source Two could be prejudicial to national defense interests
by compromising that security source of continuing value.
