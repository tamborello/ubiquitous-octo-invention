ZMISTOWSKI, CHASTINE, BROZ, FOREST JONES and

. LEO ANDERSON said they would advise regarding any infor-
‘mation coming to their attention concerning 1902 Notre

~ Dame Boulevard, Lake Worth, or persons associated there-
' with,

Miami will be alert for opportunity to utilize
confidential investigative techniques at that home. yY

It is believed that logical leads concerning
that residence and the Sea Breeze Motel, Palm Beach,
looking towards linking subject with their ownership,
have been exhausted in the Miami area insofar as the
history of those places are concerned, and future
investigation will concern current activities at 1902
Notre Dame Boulevard, Lake Worth.

JOHN R. DAY, Attorney, City Center Building,

Lake Worth, Florida, interview of whom was reported on

the administrative pages of referenced report of SA KELLOGG,
‘advised on May 8,-1961, on viewing photographs‘ of KRUSE,
BURNS and GIANCANA, that KRUSE and BURNS are the persons
with whom he has.done business in the past but he has
never seen GIANCANA. He said he saw KRUSE at the First
Federal Savings and Loan Association, Lake Worth,
subsequent to his last being interviewed and also

suggested that BURNS used to frequent the famous~ restaurant
in Lake Worth where EDDIE BROZ, son of the owner, would
probably know him. y

 

 

"On May 8, 1961, Lee MM T-4 in instant OTHER 4
report, 1109 Verdun Street, Riviera Beach, Florida, |
advised SAS RIGHARD B. KELLOGG and ROBERT W. WISEMAN
that he used to do lawn work for LESLIE KRUSE at KRUSE's

home on Seminole Avenue, Palm Beach, Florida, and obtained
that job by reason of the fact that he was working on the
lawn next door. About four years ago, KRUSE indicated
' he could get[_____—sCidwork «for a ‘couple of days a week at |
i a home in Lake.Worth, Florida, and at that time

Boulevard, Lake Worth. [i saia he works there
about 2 days a week and when he went there he was told
just to do his work and not ask any questions and that
is what he has done. U

said when he first started working
there, there was no one there and the home was all closed
up. At that time, he was paid either by KRUSE or Mr.
DICK BURNS who was a man who took care of. some of the
maintenance on KRUSE's home in Palm Beach and now takes,
care of repairs, etc., on the house in Lake Worth. About
3 years ago, JAMES FIORE moved into that house as an
overseer and has been there almost continually since that
time, and now pays[_] for his work. He said the
house has been kept open ever since FIORE got there, but
is very seldom, to his knowledge, used by anyone. He
said since he is, not around that house too much, there
could very well be someone there without his knowing it,
but to his knowledge the last time there was a group of
people there was last New Years, when there was a group
there for a few days, none of whom he could identify.
He said KRUSE was there for a few days about 2 weeks ago,
but [______]did not believe there was anyone with him
and BURNS was there once this summer reportedly looking
into the possibility of installing central heating and
air-conditioning in the house, but those are the only
persons he has seen this year. He said BURNS always
stays with FIORE when he is in town relative to the house,
and he never knew BURNS to be at the house for any
reason other than contemplated repairs or maintenance. \

[.__] said he never did mow who owned
that house and never asked any questions about it. He
said he did not know how FIORE got his job there, but
added he is always there and[______]could recall his
leaving for a day or so on only one occasion since he
arrived there. He said the only car FIORE has is a Ford
Station Wagon and he does not..associate a new Thunderbird
with that house. He said since FIORE started paying him,
he sometimes pays in cash and sometimes by check, but ;
