Larry,

The attached letters dated October 1 and 28, 1997 to the Director from the Assassination
Records Review Board (ARRB) advises the FBI of their determinations concerning JFK records.
The receipt of the letters would normally be the notice that the FBI has a seven-day period for
appeal to the President. However, the documents presented at the September 17 and October 14,
1997 meetings were finished under new guidelines. The guidelines were designed by the
Board’s staff and the JFK Task Force to facilitate the review of the subject files presented to the
House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in the late 1970's.

\

Under the new guidelines for processing the HSCA files, the FBI’s JFK Task Force
prepares:the file for release in a’draft form and the Board’s staff reviews the draft and highlights
the agreed postponements. The material proposed for postponement, but not initially approved
by the staff is negotiated by the Task Force personnel with the staff. This process usually ends
with an agreeable solution and does not go to the Board for a postponement by postponement
approval. If an agreement is not reached, then the Task Force prepares evidence to support the
postponement and presents it to the Board for approval. If the Board decides against the FBI,
then it would be necessary for the operational divisions to review the material for appeal issues.
However, the material voted at the last two meetings were documents already in agreement with
the Task Force and staff, so the Board voted the approval of the lists of document numbers.

Therefore, the FBI documents listed in the attachments either contain postponements
agreed to by the FBI or are opened in full with the FBI’s consent, leaving no appeal issues. The
ARRB letter advises that at the two meetings they approved the FBI’s postponements and
