INTERNAL ORGANIZATION PROBLEMS

 

¥

On September 23, 1965, MM P+2 advised that a
number of the members of MIRR had become disenchanted — __
with the leadership of BOSCH and his little clique which . _
controls the MIRR, and which engages in activities without
the knowledge or approVal of the membership at large.

MM T-2 said that the oppesition group to BOSCH have
been making preparations to preserve copies of certain
financial records which BOSCH and MARCELINO GARCIA have
been attempting to obtain unsuccess fully,

lained that during the past month or
2 indications are that BOSCH has not been accounting for
monies received, for monies disbursed and also, BOSCH is
no longer gainfully employed at the Abbey Medical Clinic,
amd the membership feel that BOSCH is appropriating some
of the revenues for his own purposes,

On October 29, 1965, MM T+2 said it had been

established now that the BOSCH clique has not been mak»
ing an accounting for funds received or disbursed for the

ee MM T°6 said that these 4 Cubans disclosed that
they had been im the Congo until about 8 months age.

| “MM T+6 stated that the individual who controls the 25!
“boat turned down the request of these 4 Cubans, MM %6
did net know 1£ the 4 Cubans had succeeded in obtaining —

any other boat.

  

   
     
  

  

On September 14 and 29, 1965, MM T=? advisad
that he possessed no information concermming any specific
operations planned by the MIRR in the immediate future.
MM Te2 said that BOSCH is constantly meking plans and.
counterplans and bragging about what he will accompliah
7 He approaches various exile groups and wealthy Cuban
| exiles in the Miami area in an effort to get them to

 

 
 
 

      
 

contribute money to finance a raid by the MIRR against
Guba. On July 30, 1965, BOSCH obtained $3,000 from
RECE, MM T-2 suspects that most of this money has gone
into the pockets of BOSCH and MARCELINO GARCIA,

MM T-2 said that BOSCH has become a fanatical
egomaniac, to the point where most of the members of the
MIRR are becoming uneasy under his leadership. BOSCH
believes, for instance, that he can traat with the United
States and foreign governments on matters relating te
Cuba and foreign policy.

MM T-2 pointed out that BOSCH has only two
action men in his entire organigation, These men are
DANTEL ORLANDO RAMIREZ DENIS and GERVELIO GUITERREZ
CONCEPCION, also known as "MIMO," previously mentioned
in this repert. He has no commandos ox frogmen operating
anywhere, and he has no knowa supplies or equi pment out
side the Miaml area. BOSCH acts in a very sadrerivs

of a .57 mm. recollless rifle. One of these operations
involved a commando boat raid om Santa Crus del Norte,
Havana Province; the second, a small operation against
the Arechabala refinery in Cardenas, Matanzas Prowlnce;
and the third would be an attack at sea against a Cuban’
P.T, boat. MM T#4's source said that the MIRR and the
former rebel army group had been arguing as to whe
should take credit for the attack when it ta ennounce

On October 29, 1965, MM Te4 reported having
received information from a source described as an
educated Cuban emigre in the public infermation Field.
According to this source, on October 26, 1965 BOSCH
said he has all the equipment necessary to destroy the
Arechabala refinery and that if the MIRR could effect
this operation, FIDEL CASTRO would react againet the
so-called “open door policy." (¢-+)(1 4)

On November 2, 1965, MM T-4, a” Cuban exile
who has been involved in revolutionary activities for
Several years in Miami, advised that about one week
previously a 4 man group of Cuban exiles approached a
Cuban exile leader, who has contro] over a 25' boat with

  
 
  

 

ERIANA, MANU ENITEZ and

These 4 Cubans explained that they wanted use
of this boat for an attack on a distillery located at
Santa Crug del Norte, Hawana Province. They also dis-
closed that ORLANDO BOSCH had given them a .57 2m.
vecoilless rifle, and five projectiles for this rifle,
which would be used in this operation.

On October 15, 1965, Miami informant MM T«1,
@ Cuban exile who is well acquainted with some mem
of the MIRR, reported that on October 14, 1965, BO.
right hand man, MARCELINO GARCIA JIMENEZ, was par
pating in a discussion of BOSCH's news release conce
ing the "Satrustegui.” MARCELINO GARCIA was upeet b
eause BOSCH had claimed responsibility for the bombin, :
and he added that he, himself, had told BOSCH that BOSCE
should wot tell such a lie, as this explosion was #1 he
an accidental explosion or the work of some Cuban ex
in San Juan, and that BOSCH had no business making thi
false claim for his own benefit.

On October 14, 1965, MM T-2, a member of the
MIRR who has been well informed concerning activities of
this organization for a period of several years, expressed
the opinion that BOSCH falsely claimed credit for causing. _
damage to the "Satrustegui" in order to get publicity for —
himself and the MIRR, and in order to facilitate fund.
raising among sympathetic Cuban exiles.

UM T-2 said that on Monday, October 11, 1965, :
BOSCH received a letter from the San Juan delegate of the —
MIRR, and that this letter made no comment whatsoever...
about the explosion.

Subsequently, om October 2¢, 1965, MM T.3, af
making further inquiry concerning the ineident of the
“Satrustegui,” reported that none of the other members of
the MIBR believed that the MIRR wae responsible for
explosion, and they treated BOSCH’s claim as a joke
thermore, according to MM T.2, BOSCH bas no "frogme:
commandoes, and he said that BOSCH's elaine of
constantly on the alert throughout the Caribbe:
in sabotage and other acts, whenever and where
tunity exists, are completely false. My T.2 »s.

neither RAMIREZ nor GUTIERREZ left Miami on or about
October 9, 1965, and that had either of these individ
vals been "involved in this explosion, MM T-2 felt ¢
that he and the other members of the MIBK would heve
cone aware of the operation. MM T.2 expressed the op!
that both RAMIREZ and GUTIERREZ have the ability to =
facture and place a bomb capable of damaging a ship
ever, the MIRR has no other men who possese th: now ir
or qualifications to bomb a ship. MM T-2 said teat the
MIRR members in San Juan are few in number, and that most
ef them are middle-aged bugimesgmen who have neither th
qualifications nor the temperament to engage in euch an_
activity. MM T-2 said that BOSCH ls regarded. by a number
ef the members of the MIRR ae being a liar, dishonest, and
of very questionable: charaé stér,

Other investigation eonducted relative to the.
explosion of the "Satrustegui” in the Miemi area, as well

tangible evidence whatscever that BOSCH or any member of
the MIRR was actually responsible for the explosion,
