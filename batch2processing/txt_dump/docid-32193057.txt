"KAE began the meeting by saying that WILL was
attending the club meeting as part of an attanpt by the’ Section
leadership to gain closer ties with the variotis clubs. She
then read a prepared statement ‘regarding the KENNEDY assassination.

"The gist of the statement was that, though unproved,
the ultra-right must have had some hand in the assassination.
The ultra-right was the only group which could berjefit--that

issue on the. ballott. If there is no such candidate, the
