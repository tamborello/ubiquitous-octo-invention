The Attorney General
TOTE :

Our memoranda of 9/23/75, and 11/5/75, to the :
ssc and HSC, respectively, furnished data concerning +
surreptitious entries against domestic targets,

beeakh~ins, and other trespasses. Since preparation of

these nemoranda , we have discovered entries which amend

data given to the SSC and HSC, These meroranda serve

to revise those furnished previously.

MNonorandum to the SSC concerns an October, 1963,
entry into the Mew York City offices of the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee. Iemorandym toe the HSC concerns entries
conducted in the SNOOP matter. Our response to the
SSC and HSC differ since previous submissions toe these
committees responded to different questions.

NOTE:

In regard to HSC's request set forth in their letter
12/1/75, FBIHQ files disclose that we have approximately 96
volumes pertaining to the National States Rights Party (NSRP).
These volumes consist of numerous internal memoranda, reports,
letterhead memoranda, as well as numerous miscellaneous corre-
spondence pertaining to "The Thunderbolt" which is the publication
for the NSRP. Also, there are approximately six volumes
pertaining to Jesse Benjamin Stoner, which contain numerous
reports, letterhead memoranda and internal memoranda as well as
other miscellaneous pieces of correspondence. We have one volume
pertaining to Carl W. Ridout, onevolume on John Mercer Johns,
and one volume on Vernon Higgins, which is a 170 classification
(extremist informant), Office of Origin Detroit, and is in a
closed status. He was approved as a potential extremist informant
on 7/23/73, and elevated to a full extremist informant on 3/27/74.
He furnished information on the United Klans of America. He was
discontinued on 6/20/74 for the reason that on 6/19, 20/74,
upon confrontation by Nation Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC)
personnel, Detroit, admitted to them serving as a Bureau informant
which thereafter resulted in his public exposure through NCLC
media. This exposure terminated any further capability of
Higgins functioningas a Bureau informant. NCLC is currently
under investigation by the Bureau as it is a revolutionary
socialist organization which aims to over-throw the U. S. Govern-
F. ment by force and replace it with a communist form of government.

In view of the immensity of this material, the conference between
SA Duffin and Staff Member Oliphant was necessary in order to
place this particular request into its proper perspective. The
following personnel of IS-1 Section will brief Staff Member Oliphant:
| Section Chief Joseph G. Deegan and Supervisor Vernon R. Thornton.
