If,as he claims,he has six radios and sore couriers
feeding inforration into the command group in

Havana he inieed mat have the capability of pro-
viting a creat desl of information,"ith such an interna) |
set-up it seers to me that Rays group should be ina
position to furnish SITREPS on a twice wevkdy basis to
the Embassy, and to accept ibtel requirements from use .
2. If he has a base station the RIP? eople can certain®
tune in whatever frequency he operates, and at least
eonfirm that a radio ie operating there.Ray should be
told to give us the frequency so that we can monitor
the channele

3. Furthermore, the test of his organization in whebher
he can produce oriirection from ugel suggest that

the fitad press him to come up with some proof

that he has what he claims he has,4s things now stand

only a snail of what ho claima and wants us to get es
-interested,to train hia peoplo, dispatch then and THEN <i -
