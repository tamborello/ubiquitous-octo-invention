Mr. Schwarz. You mentioned QJUWINN. Was OQUJWIN/ an agent
who you did hold in reserve for possible usa in connection . *
with the Executive Action program?

Mr. Harvey. No, OQUWIN' is an agent that I considered for

possible use and used for a limited period through ¢

 

for the spotting of individuals with criminal and underworld

{eo NR ESE (ste canteen mnansnar oan
connections in Europe for possible multi-purpose use, none of
FOr e ETT

whom were aver advised of the use, none of whom, as far as I
personally know, were. ever used.

Mr. Schwarz. But the multi-purpose use included as one
purpose the possible use in assassination?

ev
Mr. Harvey. Only Ahe sense that had we ever been saddled

 

with a flat, if you will, command performance on assassination.
I might have considered the people spotted by WIN. as possibil-
ities.

But, you see, before anybody that is ever spotted is
approached for any operation and particularly -- and please, I
don't mean to sound pedantic on this, i<-dewrte-mean-te—-- is
Dall GE
actually approached, there #s-—a long period of assessment,
crosschecks, so on and so forth. This particular spotting
mechanism never actually went that far, as far as I know.

I only know of one use made by QJWIN until we terminated

him some months later, I don't remember the exact date. It was

 

before I went to .Rome. I know it was in connection with an

 

  
  

peration in the Congo that was not an assassination operatio

I have checked pages 1 and 2 and 3 and my page 4.

Mr. Schwarz. Are pages 4 through 7, in your judgment;

pages that were written by {MEaeAr

 

Mr. Harvey. As a guess, I'd say they appear to be in the
same writing as these first three pages.

Mr. Schwarz. Are pages 8 and 9 pages that are written by
you?

Mr. Harvey. Well, just a moment, let me get to those.

I would also like to point out that from page 4 that --
that is page 4, as long as it continues in the same handwriting
was - not a part of this so-called Project Outline, these I

would guess, were probably f

 

en's notes and probably
based, at least to an extent, on discussions he had with me,
and certain sort of problems and questions and principles that
I tossed out to be considered and cares to be exarcised.

Mr. Schwarz. Then pages 8 and 9 are in your handwriting,
is that right? ~ ;

Mr. Harvey. Pages 8 and 9 are in my handwriting.

Mr. Schwarz... And at the bottom of page 8, does that

Eyes Only basis, and the first part of this was the necessary
documentation for the authority which was later signed off on
by Dick Helms as Deputy Director.

Beginning on my page 4, your middle of page 3.--

Mr. Schwarz. Well, just a moment. Page 1 is a cover story,
not the real story, the objectives--

Mr. Harvey. It is both.

Mr. Schwarz. But it does not recite as an. objective, <.-
assassination. or: assassination: capability.

Mr. Harvey. No, it does not.

 

Mr. Schwarz. Instead, it cites

 

Mr. Harvey. Which, I would like to point out, was a
perfectly legitimate objective and was not in a sense, a cover

story except that if this project had gone so far as to the

 

actual recruitment of any agent for assassination or the target-
ting of any target or the mounting of any operation, it would
have been under this as a cover. But, those assets that were

spotted by QUWINN, for instance, under ZRRIFLE were also

 

honestly considered for possible clandestine procurement§

 

 

So it's -- maybe I'm not making this clear, it's a cover
in a sense, but it's not a phony cover, in other words.
Mr. Schwarz. Dual purpose.

Mr. Harvey. It was a dual purpose.

of assassination is obviously a two-pronged subject, ours and
theirs. We spent countless hours over the years trying to
determine the parameters of how far the Soviet service was
willing to go. This was partly a question of assessment;.
this was partly a question, to put it just as bluntly,
of self-protection.

I will try to summarize what I think are fair conclusions.

In the field of political assassination, although I cannot

  
  
  
  

document this by evidence, I have no question but what the
Soviet service has, does, and will continue to use the tool o
assassination to accomplish political gains inside and outside
of the USSR. In the intelligence field, I think you have to

Make «a. distinction, the distinction roughly -- and I'm over-

 

 

 

simplifying this slightly -- but a distinction into perhaps
three classes.

One, their own ethnics or nationals. Sacondly, indigenous
agents Of:third countries.And thirdly, the recognized official

staff officers of other intelligence services.

  

During the seven years that I spent & ma, which was
the longest continuous period that I was exposed in depth to
Soviet Executive Action, we lost a great many Russians, a great
many Germans, a certain number of Czechs, Poles and other
nationalities.

“Mrz. Schwarz. When you say you lost Russians, you mean

Russians who were working with the United States?

counterespionage for a brief period against the Japanese and
the Italians and the Russians in '41. Then during most of the
War, against the Germans, and then beginning in early '45 until
the middle of '47 against the Soviet service again.

Mr. Schwarz. And then in 1947, did you join the CIA as
head of the Soviet Intelligence Branch?

Mr. Harvey. That is correct.

Mr. Schwarz. Is that also counterespionage?

Mr. Harvey. Yes, it was.

‘Mr. Schwarz. And then between 1947 and 1952, you worked
on Soviet counterespionage and certain special operations in
the Department for Plans, is that right?

Mr. Harvey. Well, that is correct. It was a particular

command and staff responsibility on \eormuniea tions:

 

and for - a: period of, I would think probably eight to ten

months, I’ headed a planning staff, along with that.

  

Mr. Schwarz. In 1952, did you go to fsemiess
for the CIA?

Mr. Harvey. I did.

Mr. Schwarz. And were you there until. 1959?
Mr. Harvey. Until the end of 1959.

rather substantial accomplishments there, such as
