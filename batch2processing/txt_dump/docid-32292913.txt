. The General Telephone Company of Florida does not
generally use the tip and ring party type of ringing on party
lines, They use bridged ringing with harmonic ringers using
some or all of the below-listed frequencies:

16,6-cycle harm@nic

20-cycle harmonic or decimonic
25-cycle harmonic

30-cycle harmonic or rier

of Mr. WITHERS that a 3, 000- ohm resistor across the subscriber's.
line would possibly tend to change the ringer frequency causing

_ possible failure to ring or an alteration of the sound of. the
bell due to the lack of full ringing current.

The "Line Compensating Rheostat" in the manually
~, adjusted loop compensator circuit would normally be set at 0
on a long cable loop such as in the telephone installation serving
_the subscriber in this case. With the "loop, compensator" set —
at zero, the 400-ohm resistor is in effect shorted out. When
set in this zero position it is noted that the switch element
of the "loop compensator" adds a capacitor and resistor to
the sidetone balancing impedence to more nearly match the
capacitive impedence of the long cable loop. In installations. -
where it is desirable to set the compensating rheostat at zero ™.
but where the sidetone balancing network is not desired in
the circuit, it is the practice to set the "loop compensator"
just off zero where the 400-ohm resistance would be shorted
out but just short of the point where the switch connects the.
sidetone balancing network. It is felt that a short could be.
placed across the "400~-ohm resistor of the loop compensator"
to prevent the rheostat from developing an open or becoming.
noisy without effecting the operation of the instrument. so H
The sidetone balancing network could then be either, in the et
circuit if the "loop compensator" is set at zero, or out of
the circuit on any other setting. Ona party line this would
--also apply as "loop compensators" are set without regard for : |
other telephones in the circuit. The loop compensation rheostat
_ ghould be set in such a position as to cause 60 milliamperes of
current to flow in the line.

 

Mr. WITHERS has advised that in his opinion a 3, 000-ohm
' yesistance across the subscriber's line could cause an echo
effect and would make a noticeable difference in transmission
level. It could possibly cause central office equipment to-
reject the line indicating a trouble condition.

 

A Vincent Rare Gas Relay is sometimes used across: <°
a eubscriber's line to eliminate interference from nearby
. power lines. t is not believed that this. will have any
effect upon sn[Sputyinstatiation,

Telephone service is presently being installed in
‘the home of subscriber JOE DIEZ, where the ;altered telephone ©
using the 3,000-ohm resistor would ‘be. used. The actual loop
resistance of this line is being méasured and a simulated
circuit will be set up to test theories described above.
The Bureau will be advised of the result of these tests.
