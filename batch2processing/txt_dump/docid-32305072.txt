CONSPIRATORIAL
ASPECTS

KC T-9 advised on January 29, 1964, that it is
T-9's impression that SAM PALMA is a member of the La Cosa
Nostra and has been on “hits", T-9 based this on informa-

’. tion received in which PALMA has indicated that he has
‘often. sat in a car for hours-on end without eating and this
. was PALMA's method of stating that he had traveled on "a
hit", PALMA was reported to have stated that he knows a

lot of people in different cities throughout the country
and has done a lot of traveling.

T-9 also advised that SAM PALMA had mentioned. to
an acquaintance that he wished this individual to contact
"CHECKERS" in Denver when this individual was visiting
them, “CHECKERS may refer to CLYDE SMALDONE, a well-known
Denver criminal figure, ,

T-9 advised on April 16, 1964, that SAM PALMA,
through arrangements made with ROY WILLIAMS, President of
Joint Teamsters Council #56, Kansas City, Missouri, will
be going to Sacramento, California, "because a man in
Sacramento needs some muscle", PALMA is to be paid
$1,000 a week and had planned to fly to California where
he would be met by a man whom WILLIAMS had previously
contacted, T-9 stated this trip was delayed due to
illness of the individual PALMA was to meet in California,
however, he intends to take this trip in the future,

T-9 stated that T-9 was unable to determine
whether PALMA's services involved threat-type situations
or a killing but from the expressions used by PALMA, T-9
assumed it would be threat-type situations rather than a
killing.

PALMA has FBI #327 429 A, date of birth March 3,
1925, and has been previously described by informants as a
member of the criminal organization in Kansas City.

. KC T-8 advised during September, 1963, that
ANTHONY CIVELLA, nephew of NICK CIVELLA, ‘had told associates
that SAM GIANCANA of Chicago, Illinois, was the "boss of
Chicago, Kansas City, and St.~Louis",
