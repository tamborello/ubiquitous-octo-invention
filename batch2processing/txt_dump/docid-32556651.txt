The Swixx Central Police Bureau noted that
although they had previously recorded ALEX's birthdate
as April 1, 1914, in their records,it is April 1, 1916,
in his passport.

Chicago T-4 advised that. he had learned in
May of 1965, that ALEX intended to appeal the, banning
by the Swiss Government.

On March 1, 1965, the Police Judiciaire
(Criminal Police), Surete Nationale, furnished the following
additional information in the captioned matter,- which had
been .developed by further investigation:

According to the PJSN (Police Judiciaire,
Surete Nationale), subject registered at the Hotel Bristol,
Paris, on January 16, 1965. At that time he gave his date
of birth as April 1, 1916, in Illinois, and presented U. S.
passport B 4019963, which was issued October 16, 1961 at
Chicago, Illinois. He was accompanied by DIETGARD ROSE MARIE
FUEGER, who was born December 3, 1938, at Seewalchen, Austria.
According to the hotel records, FUEGER was listed as being
in possession of French Identity Card RZ 45437, which was
issued: August 12, 1961, and her home address was listed as
177 Promenade des Anglais, Nice, France.

' It was subsequently ascertained by the PJSN

. that through an error at the reception -desk of the hotel,
the identifying information was erroneously attributed to
FUEGER at the time she registered. The PJSN later inter-
viewed THERESE GARELLI, another customer of. the hotel at
that time, verified that the identity card in.question..
actually belonged to her, and established that she had no
knowledge of or connection with subject or’ FUEGER.

The PJSN stated that subject and FUEGER departed
the hotel on January 20, 1965, for an unknown destination.
Subject and his companion did not otherwise come tothe

attention of French Police authorities during their: brief
stay in Paris.

On May 14, 1965, Agent TOM MANSON, U.S.
Customs, 610 South Canal, Chicago, was advised of FUEGER's
departure and requested to be alert for her return. On
the same date JACK BURKE, Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS), 219 South Dearborn, Chicago, was also
advised of FUEGER's departure and he stated he would
ascertain whether or not FUEGERs name is still on the “look-
out list" and take the necessary precautions to have her
thoroughly interrogated upon her return to this country.

The Bundeskriminalamt (BKA - West German
Federal Criminal Police) has furnished the following
information:

A check of the records available through TWA
Airways in Frankfurt/Main, West Germany, failed to reveal
any information indicating that SUZANNE FUEGER arrived by
TWA from New York between May 12 and May 19, 1965. No
passenger lists are maintained on the local flights of
Lufthansa between Frankfurt/Main and Munich, Germany, and
therefore no record on FUEGER could be located for travel
between these points. Further, FUEGER has not been located
at any hotel in Munich.

Inquiries in Munich have revealed that FUEGER’s
mother, ELSE ROSE FUEGER, sold her house in the village
of Riederau for a sum of 40,000 Marks, and purchased a flat
at 12 Martha-Braeustrasse, Fuerstenfeldbruck, West Germany.
This is a town in the immediate vicinity of Munich.

Mr, and Mrs. PRASSE, son-in-law and daughter,
respectively, of Mrs. FUEGER, were residing with her in the
house in Riederau, and as of May 18, 1965, were still in

the house, although they planned to move shortly to Nuernberg,

West Germany. The inquiries indicated that the sale of
the house led to quarrels in the family.

Police efforts are continuing to obtain some
information regarding FUEGER's activities.
