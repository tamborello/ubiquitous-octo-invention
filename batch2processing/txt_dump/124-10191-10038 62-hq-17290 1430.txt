Memorandum from D. Ryan to Mr. Bassett
Re: House &lect Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)
62-117290

In his letter of 12/13/78, Mr. Blakey, writing on
behalf of Chairman Stokes, explained that since the informant
report in question stemmed from Patterson, it was his @lakey's)
understanding that our release of materials would include
no objection to Patterson having what he had originally given
to the FBI. Mr. Blakey expressed regret that this instance
caused any concern and assured the Director that the HSCA
would continue to afford FBI material all measures of ©
confidentiality in compliance with the Memorandum of Under-
standing.

Upon receipt of Mr. Blakey's letter, the Director
attached a routing slip, noting "Are you satisfied with \
this response? Anything further required?" ee

Mr. Blakey is correct that the informant report
in question was prepared by Patterson and given the Bureau
in 1971. However, the FD-306 cover sheet was attached by
the FBI upon filing and, therefore, did not originate with
Patterson. Further, at the time of our release of material
concerning Patterson, the HSCA was not given authorization to
release any document from FBI files to Patterson. Mr. Blakey
should be advised to this effect to correct his understanding
that we have no objection to Patterson (or any other outside
party) having what he originally furnished to the FBI. If
Patterson desires FBI information concerning himself, he
should request same under the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) and not from the HSCA. In this instance, according
to SA John Howard, FOIPA Branch, Records Management Division,
the FD-306 and attached report would have been provided
Patterson under the FOIA.

Although Mr. Blakey's letter assures that our docu-
ments will be afforded full security in the future, it is
believed a letter should be directed to him correcting his

Director's Sec’y ._

PURPOSE: To furnish status of the issue involving release

by the HSCA of an FBI document to an outside party,
as addressed in correspondence to HSCA Chairman, Louis V.
Stokes, on 12/6/78 and responded to by HSCA Chief Counsel
and Director, G. Robert Blakey, on 12/13/78, and to recommend
attached letter be sent to Mr. Blakey requesting he identify
any other FBI documents furnished by this Bureau to the HSCA

_ which may have been similarly released.

DETAILS: By letter dated 12/6/78 (copy attached with enclosures),
HSCA Chairman Louis V. Stokes was furnished a copy

of an FBI document dated 5/26/71, an informant report from the

St. Louis Field Office file of | former infofmant Oliver Patterson.

This informant report, along with three telated items of

correspondence, was furnished to the FBI via the Department of

Justice (DOJ) by Harold Weisberg, a private citizen, author

and self-styled assassination prober. Mr. Weisberg received

the document from Patterson.

The informant report in question was furnished the
HSCA in response to the Committee's request dated 1/26/78 for
all retrievable information concerning Patterson. Our letter
to Mr. Stokes expressed concern that a document of this nature
entered the public domain in such a manner and requested that
the HSCA, in compliance with the Memorandum of Understanding,
afford proper and necessary security to our documents during the
course of future public hearings and the HSCA final report.
