- -As the Bureau is aware the Phila. Div. has in recent
f months ‘utilized an Edwards Model M-75 Binaural Pocket Tape Re-
corder:.: in complementing the efforts of PH 672-C-TE, The use of
this device is ‘surprisingly simple and in no way poses a problem
of security if it is properly attached to person's body.

Utilization of this device has definitely established
PH 672-C-TE. as a member of La Cosa Nostra. It has confirmed
the membership of several others suspected of being members
and has obtained conversations which enabled Agents working AR
matters to better comprehend the struggles, jealousies and
treachery within La Cosa Nostra's ranks.

This-device, if used properly, could be widely used
by the Bureau in its efforts to confirm La Cosa Nostra member-
ship of CIs who claim to be members, In addition the tapes
would-be of immeasurable evidentiary value in proving the
actual La Cosa Nostra membership of persons recorded if the
informant is ever called upon to testify in this regard.

By separate communication several tape recordings of

actual conversations between La Cosa Nostra members will be se
' to. the FBI Laboratory for "dubbing." Copies will be designated
for the Special Investigative Division which should consider
utilizing these tapes as educational aides at Criminal Intelli-
gence In-Service lectures. It is believed that exposure of
Agents attending Criminal Intelligence In-Service training to
the successes of this technique could conceivably augment the

\ sr educational value of the Bureau's AR @ ol f pony is
