October 28, 1963 Conein meets with Don for last time
before coup is launched and is told
that he will receive four hours' no- -

1315 hours Instead of getting four hours' notice,

of start of coup.35 An aide to Don
tells Conein to go to Joint General
Staff (JGS) headquarters and bring
with him all the money he can lay his
hands on. Conein takes 3 million plastre

November 2, 1963 oan

0650 hours Diem calls Don with offer to surrender
unconditionally. 45 :

The generals proceed to palace to pick
up Diem and Nhu and escort them to JGS.
They will request preference as to
destination and seek approval of the
country designated. 46

0800 hours Escort at ace, but neither Diem nor
Nhu appear. 47

,
How Diem and Nhu leave the palace and are subsequently located is
a question open to dispute. Conein speculates that they escaped through a
third, unknown tunnel48 and go to a Catholic Church in Cholon. Being familiar
‘faces, an informant identifies them and calls JGS.49 ‘Another less specula-
tive and more detailed account, by a CIA source, states that Diem and Nhu
left the palace the previous evening with a Chinese businessman and went to
the Church at 0800 hours, November 2, 1963. Ten minutes later, they were
picked up by the Army and forced into an Army vehicle, in which they were
locked.509 Higgins reports this account to some extent, but states that
Diem called Kniem, a coup leader, and offered to resign, disclosing their
whereabouts in Cholon. Then, she states, Minh called a meeting, ‘excluding
Khiem, and a convoy was organized. Diem and Nhu are forced into a vehicle,
left to themselves by Colonel Lam, who seeks their safe conduct. When Lam,
at the end of the convoy, arrives at JGS, he finds Diem has been shot in
the back of the head, and Nhu stabbed in the chest and shot numerous times
in the back. Both had their hands tied behind their backs.91 Minh tells
Conein that Diem and Nhu committed suicide, but Conein doubts that a Catholic
would take his life in a church.52 Minh, according to Higgins, later states
that his aide, Captain Nhung, had gotten into the vehicle with Diem and Nhu
and, having been provoked into an argument, shoots them both.53 There is
little support for this story by Minh in that pictures revealed a bloody
death and their hands tied.54 In any event » Nhung is assumed to be the
executioner,25 but only one account blames Minh for giving the order, al-
though it might be expected that an aide to a general would be so acting.56

2. Signi ficance

Lodge presents credentials to Diem.16
CIA agents Conein and Spera are told
to tell the generals the substance of
Deptel 243, but that "we cannot be of
any help during initial action of as-
suming power of state."17

Maxwell Taylor; in a cable, elicits
Harkins! views on feasibility of opera-
tion as Washington is having second
thoughts. Taylor claims that Deptel
243 was prepared "without DoD or JCS
participation. "18

Conein and Spera meet with generals,

who want firm evidence of U.S. support,
and Minh flatly states that in order to
do this, U.S. should stop economic aid
to Diem (which was done in September) .19

In a CIA cable from Saigon, Washington
is told, "(t)his particular coup is
finished....generals did not feel ready
and did not have sufficient balance of
forces....There is little doubt that
GVN aware U.S. role and may have con-
siderable detail..."20

This period bears examination because it, and principally
Deptel 243, sets the tone for later relations between the Country Team
and the generals. Minh, disbelieving at first that the U.S. is really
supporting him, grows in confidence, despite the U.S. military's continu-
ing support of Diem.2l In the next period, Minh finds that of the 15 or
so coups22 being planned, Lodge, through Conein, endorses his.23 Nhu
promises to get out of Saigon, but by this time no one trusts another's

word and Nhu stays.

C. The November Coup

i. Chronology
September 13, 1963

Lodge complains bitterly that having
to meet with Diem "is an extremely

-time consuming procedure" and asks .

that he not have to do so unless he

Special Forces, under personal loyalty
to Nhu, attack several pagodas in the
Saigon area. Reasons for the raid are
unclear, but they may be (a) timed
when there is no U.S. Ambassador in
South Vietnam (Nolting left a few days
before and Lodge was on his way)? and
to (b) an effort by the Nhu's to strike
back’ at a pagoda which "was more a
political command post than a holy
place, | serving as Quang's headquar-

ters.

Deptel 243, prepared by Roger Hilsman,
Assistant Secretary of State for Far
Eastern Affairs, and Undersecretary of
State Averell Harriman,11 and cleared
in Hyannisport by President Kennedy ,12
is dispatched to the newly arrived Am-
bassador Lodge. It demands that Diem
rid himself of his brothers, Nhu and Can,
and, if he does not do so, Lodge is told
that the U.S. will no longer support
Diem. Further, he is told to convey

to military commanders the assurance
that they will receive "direct support
in any interim period of. breakdown
central government...."13 The Country
Team is directed to look at alternative
Vietnamese leaders and make plans as

"to how we might bring about Diem's
replacement if this should become neces-
sary. "14

In a CIA cable, Chief of Station Richard-
son reports back the results of a con-
ference among Lodge, Deputy Chief of
Mission Trueheart, General Harkins (Com
mander, MACV), and himself. The group
concludes that giving Diem option in
Hilsman's cable has no chance of suc-
ceeding, and accepts Deptel 243 as de-
cision from Washington. 15

 

HW 50955 Docld:32423540 Page 7
Cc. Alternatives
Tt appears that the Committee should either: |
1. Consider the Diem assassination not as an element of CIA
involvement in the killing of foreign leaders, but as an instance of
“U.S. intervention in the internal affairs of a foreign country, not
unlike Chile, which led to a coup and the leader's not totally unex-
pected murder by indigenous military; or

2, Examine McGeorge Bundy and others on the delay in obtaining
air evacuation for Diem and Nhu to a country of asylum; or

3. Continue staff investigation further to develop existing
evidence as to the killing; or

4, Draft a report based on evidence available at this time.

D. Recommendation

It is recommended that the Committee examine McGeorge Bundy
and others, if necessary, on the delay in air evacuation to asylum.

II. History
A. The Bombing in Hue |
1. Chronology
May 6, 1963 Diem revives regulation banning
‘ public display of any religious

flag — either Buddhist or Catholic
-- probably due to excessive dis-
play of the Vatican_flag in DaNang
a few days earlier.1

May 7, 1963 Vui Van Long arrives in Hue and,

‘ , seeing the city already bedecked
with flags for the Buddha's birth-
day the next day, tells Buddhist ~
monks that the regulation will not
be enforced. Despite Long's rever-
sal of the order, Thich Tri Quang,

a Buddhist monk, decides to send

 

HW 50955 Docld:32423540 Page 5
monks around to tell people to
take down flags as a result of
Diem's order.

May 8, 1963 : Quang publicly criticizes Diem at
Buddhist gathering for flag regula-
tion and crowd gathers at a radio
station, resulting in grenades be-
ing exploded. There is a conflict
in the evidence as to who threw
the grenades as (a) it was general-
ly assumed that Diem's troops caused
the 8 deaths, but (b) medical evi-
dence found that none of the bodies
had metal fragments, implying the
grenades were plastic, usually as-
sociated with Viet Cong.3

2. Significance

Conein stated that this event was the catalyst that brought
down the Dien regime.” This event, along with the self-immolation by monks
and Madame Nhu's (Diem's sister-in-law) incredibly bloodthirsty statements
that she would like to furnish some mustard at a bonzes (monks) barbeque,?
received unfavorable press and brought pressure on the Kennedy Administra~
tion to disassociate itself from that of Diem and apply "direct, relentless
and tablehammering pressure on Diem such as the United States had seldom

before attempted with a friendly sovereign government. ''6

B. The Abortive August 1963 Coud

1. Chronology
July 4, 1963 The initial conscious decision and
. agreement among the coup principals
C (Generals Minh, Don, Kim, and Khiem)
takes place, probably before this
date; even though the August coup
fails, the intention is never aban-
doned.7
July 1963 A majority of the coup plotters, in-

cluding Minh, desire that Diem retire.
_As to Ngo Dinh Nhu, his wife Madame Nhu,
and the warlord brother Ngo Dinh Can,
there was never dissention -- their
deaths are welcomed.

RE : Diem Assassination

I. Overview
A. Summary

The assassinations of South Vietnamese President Diem and his
brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, on November 2, 1963, concurrent with a Vietnamese
generals'coup, represents the most remote, if even that, instance of CIA
involvement in the murder of a foreign leader presently being considered
by the Committee. Based on all available evidence, Diem's assassination
appears to have been a spontaneous and solely Vietnamese-inspired act,
guided by anger at Diem for not making available his resignation or
presence to coup leaders. The only remaining incident casting doubt on
this evidence is the failure of the American Embassy to provide safe
conduct for Diem and Nhu out of the country, as originally planned by
the generals. (See paragraph II.E.) Nhu's assassination was a part of
the plan almost from its inception.

B. Conclusions

1. Diem's assassination represents not an incident of an abuse
by CIA as much as it does an account of mistaken national policy.

2. The Kennedy Administration, under intense public pressure
from both the New York Times and other dispatches from Saigon, sought
to disassociate itself from the repressive Diem regime.

3. A rift between the staff members of State and the National
Security Council, on the one hand, and DoD and CIA, on the other, as to.
whether Diem and Nhu must be driven from office exacerbated the situation
and ill-served President Kennedy.

4, Although the generals relished the idea of killing Diem's
brother, Nhu, it was considered that Diem himself would be allowed to
live and either leave the country or, possibly, even retain the presi-
dency. No evidence has been adduced that U.S. representatives were
aware of the murder of Diem until after it was done.
