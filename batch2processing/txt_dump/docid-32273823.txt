Attention: Steve Skancke
National Security Council
The White House
Washington, D.€. 20500

Dear Mrs. Davis:

During a recent visit to the Lyndon B. Johnson Library, Dan
Dwyer and Michael Epstein, staff members of the Senate Select
Committee oh Intelligence Activities, conducted research
among ceftali classified records and requested copies of
selected documents. Tha documents have been transmitted to
uy office by courier service and are enclosed herein for
review by the NSC staff before presentation to the select
comm ttee. This is a procedure agreed to by Steve SkKancke
in a télephona conversation with md on May 12, 1976.

 

Among thése documents is a record of conversation with

J. Edgar Hoover dated November 24, 1963. While this
document is not presently classified, I believe that it
should be reviewed by the NSC staff as probably containing
classified information.

The select committee staff has expressed a sense of urgency
and has requested that these documents be reviewed and con-
veyed to the committee ag soon as possible. Would you plaase
advise me of the outeome of your review.

Sincerely,

RICHARD A. JACOBS ~
