Although HERRERO and CARBONELL were in frequent con-
tact during 1963 and HERRERO had visited CARBONELL's residence |
on one or two occasions, he knew little or nothing about
CARBONELL's personal life of his associates, CARBONELL was
considered to: be a “loner and was somewhat. secretivé about
his movements, a oP coming and going without warning. Clete

Aas a C a
Other thea 4Gs"friendship with PRUDENCIO\DUENAS fel Rete
and his wife HILDA.and his acquaintance with HERRERO and ee
ALONSO, all of whomvere sincerely anti=CASTRO, HERRERO did
not know any of CARBONELL's friends, e_ had aver heard
ot

 

 

CARBONELL mention anyone by the name of [Paco RRERO had/@, i
never noted that CARBONELL had made any par lar effort VY. j
to try to develop specific information concerning the activities
| or plans of the anti=CASTRO activists in Miami.

CARBONELL was generally considered ‘to be a reputable
individual and HERRERO had never noticed anything that would i
suggest that CARBONELL was involved in subversive activities
against the United States or in behalf of the Cuban Govern-
ment. In retrospect, HERRERO realized that CARBONELL had
apparently used his contacts with HERRERO and his colleagues
to obtain information about their activities.

HERRERO stated he had not seen or heard from CAR= '
BONELL since the Summer of 1964 when HERRERO had visited
Miami from Puerto Rico, It was about that time that HERRERO |
had contacted CARBONELL's residence and learned that he was i
in New York City. :

HERRERO stated that he is a permanent resident of
the United States and considers this to be his second country.
He indicated that if he ever obtained any additional infor-
mation concerning CARBONELL or his activities, he would
immediately contact United States Government authorities.
