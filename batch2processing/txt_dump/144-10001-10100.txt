Our Everything points to the continuation, Prd ‘the internal
struggle [B val based] on the political interpretation of KENNEDY's assassi-
nation. Immediately after the attempt, the initial commentaries linked it
with the racist movement, which assumed the offensive by rdllying themselves
around the efforts of the Texas police in order to saddté OSWALD, a reputed pro
CASTRO activist who two years ago wanted to remain in’the’USSR, with the
responsibility for the attempt. The arrest of Cubaris was begun in Dallas.
GOLDWATER, who yesterday refused to comment on the assassination, joined the
campaign. Radio and television suspended ell.their-‘programs and -- with minor
exceptions which included ABC directed among other's by the former EISENHOWER
press agent HAGHERTY -- taking advantage of this “background to bring about anti-
communist hysteria. The fact that Satutdey through Monday are days free of
work facilitates reaching the community »

Today's declaration by JOHNSON and the ‘Department of State ve the
existence of reputed facts of. a conspiracy against KENNEDY's life involving
the USSR and Cuba has as its aim the,restraint of the campaign of extreme
racists, which can create ‘difficulty in overcoming the internal situation and
could paralyze the foreign policy’ of Washington.

Probably in woiy to t declarations circulated among the American
press (among othérs in the is the theme that the KENNEDY murder could have
been inspired: by those centers in the USSR which do not want a detente. This
theme is also being linked with the attempt to arrest BARGHOORN, the downing
of the Tranian aircraft, and Berlin access roads.

It is “anticipated that immediately after the funeral personal intrigue will
begin. Speculation of RUSK's resignation are being repeated (possible succes—
sors, FULBRIGHT or HARRIMAN if JOHNSON is determined to continue the present
relations with the USSR. and BUNDY or perhaps someone comparable but thus far
an unknown politician at” he, decides to lead the Democratic party to the
elections on a wave of hardfast foreign policy).
