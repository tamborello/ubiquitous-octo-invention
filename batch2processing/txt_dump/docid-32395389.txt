SUBJECT: Contact of Lee OSWALD with a member of Soviet KGB
Assassination Department

1. According to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Lee OSWALD
was at the Soviet Embassy there on 28 September 1963 and spoke with the
Consul, Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV. This was learned when OSWALD called
the Soviet Embassy on 1 October, identifying himself by name and spesking
broken Russian, stating the above and asking the guard who answered the phone
whether there was “anything new concerning the telegram to Washington.”

The guard checked and then told OSWALD that a request had been sent, but
nothing had as yet been received. (MEXI 6453, 9 October 1963) The FBI liaison
officer, Mr. Pappich, told me on 23 November that the Bureau has reason to
believe that OSWALD's visit was to get Soviet support for a U.S. passport or
visa matter /perhaps the new passport mentioned in the press articles).

2. KOSTIKOV is an identified KGB officer. He was a case officer in an
operation which is evidently sponsored by the KGB's 13th Department (responsible
for sabotage and assassination). This operation, which is controlled by the
FBI under the cryptonym TUMBLEWEED, involved a German-national resident of
Oklahoma who was recruited in Europe, and met this year with KOSTIKOV in Mexico
City and shortly thereafter with a known 13th Department officer, Oleg BRYKIN,
in New York. The instructions given TUMBLEWEED by the two officers, (pinpointing
objectives for sabotage) and the circumstances of their involvement in the case,
left no doubt that both of them were working for the same component, the

13th. .
3. Of course it is not usual for a KGB agent on a sensitive mission to
have such overt contact with a Soviet Embassy. However, we have top secret
Soviet intelligence documents, describing Military Intelligence doctrine, which
show that very important agents can be met in official installations using as -
cover for their presence there some sort of open business: Vice Admiral

L. BEKRENEV, in a top secret lecture to a Soviet Military Intelligence course
at Military-Diplomatic Academy, 1960, said,

"Case officers who use as cover, let us say, the Soviet Trade
,Representation, TASS or Sovinformburo, can use their cover
assignments as backstopping for non-clandestine meetings with

certain agents whose particular activities officially associate

them with the previously mentioned Soviet institutions. However,

such non-clandestine meetings within a legal residency should be
restricted to a minimum both as to place and time. Meetings of

this type should be carried out only in exceptional cases with

tested and reliable agents in order to avoid provocation by the

local -counterintelligence service against the Soviet installation
being used as cover. Such meetings are held as a rule in the work
offices of the case officer or of the agent during working hours.

It is necessary that such meetings be conducted naturally, that

they do not attract the attention of outsiders, and that the receipt
and transmittal of intelligence matters, properly camouflaged, be
carried out discreetly. In setting up such meetings, measures against
tapping must be taken. One must bear in mind that a meeting with
persons outside official premises and during non-working hours usually
signifies a relationship between the two parties that is above and
beyond official matters."

Also, such contact in official installations may be caused by the agent's own
carelessness. Again Admiral BEKRENEV speaks:

"Some agents, because of inexperience or because of deliberate

violation of the rules of security through peculiar personal

rashness,.... approached our case officers at places not stipulated

as operational meeting sites, others telephoned the case officer at

his Soviet installation and discussed personal contact arrangements,

while others still showed up personally at the Soviet installation in
. order to contact the case officer." *

4. I called the above connections to the attention of Mr. Pappich by
phone to his FBI office at 1030 hours on 23 November.
