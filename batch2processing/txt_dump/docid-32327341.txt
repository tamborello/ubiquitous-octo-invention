ADMINISTRATIVE (Cont'd):

discontinued.

report of SA THOMAS T, CACAVAS, dated 4/21/60, it is noted
one MARVIN KANTOR is mentioned with no further identification
Or relationship with MURRAY BROWN, a neurotic. Investigation
was consequently discontinued and since nothing definite
was developed concerning BROWN, the above facts are not
set forth in this report.

 

t va
“Also; NY file 105-50887 refers to MARVIN KANTOR, a
the applicant, as an informant of the NYO and the infor-
mation furnished by him is-not pertinent to his investigation.
