LA COSA NOSTRA

 

A number of scurces have reported leadership changes in three
La Cosa Nostra "families" within recent months. Set forth below are the |
background details on these changes, including a complete summary of the
Gallo-Profaci feud which played such a prominent part in the realignment
of power in the old Profaci "family. ”

Bonanno Retires

The "Criminal Intelligence Digest’ of January 9, 1964, reported the
fact that La Cosa Nostra "Commission" member Joseph Bonanno had disappeared
on the west coast during the early part of August, 1963, and had possibly fled
the country in order to avoid prosecution for income-tax evasion. On
December 16, a highly confidential source of the New York office advised that
Bonanno had called a meeting of his caporegimas (captains) to announce that he
would be leaving for “quite a while” and that his brother-in-law, Francesco
(Frank) LaBruzzo, would run the “family” in his absence. Assisting LaBruzzo
in this assignment was Bonanno's son, William, a caporegima in charge of the
Tucson, Arizona, area for the “family, " whose headquarters are in New York
City. (1)

By March 3, 1964, however, it was reported that the elder Bonanno
wanted to retire and have LaBruzzo named permanent capo (boss) of the
“family."' Approximately three weeks later, Bill Bonanno advised a source of
the New York office that ‘the old man is out of it now” and that LaBruzzo had
“taken his place.’ On April 5, 1964, LaBruzzo called a “formality meeting
of his caporegimas, in connection with which he stated that he had not yet
assumed full control of the “family, ” pending some unspecified action on the
part of his predecessor. He also took the occasion to announce that William
Bonanno had resigned his post of caporegima in order to accept an appointment
