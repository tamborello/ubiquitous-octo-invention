attended two meetings of the American Underground during the
middle part of August, 1965, at the home of Delbert Ray in
Midlothian, Texas. Dallas T=-1 stated that he had heard that
these meetings lasted approximately one to two hours and
involved discussions concerning how the U. 8. Government was
infiltrated by members of the Communist Party or by individuals :
who are sympathetic to the goals of the Communist Party.

 

 

Dallas T-1 advised that at one of these meetings
approximately one hour was spent in target or practice shooting
with pistols by several members of the organization. Dallas T-1
stated that he was quite certain that Otto "Duke" Koling, and
Arthur Pollard attended both of the above meetings. Dallas T-1
