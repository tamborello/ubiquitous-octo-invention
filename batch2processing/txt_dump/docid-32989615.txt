3

to you under date of September 32, 1970, upon which i predicated my letter
to the President of Eeptember 21, L870, At that time I believed that by
reason of your approval of the various memoranda dealing with the foreign
Haiaon operations, you were in accord with the procedures which the Bureau
bad followed and, in fact, spproved the eetablishment of additional) Hatson
offices which i Heted in my letter te the Fresident of Sextember 21, 1970,
and whith 1 indieated was prediccted upon Mr. Brennan's memorandum of
september 21, 1970,

¥ want to also point ovt that at no time, either in September or
saove recentiy, did | ever suggest to the President the idea that we should
expand our foreigs Haison operations. it was the President's idea expressed
to soe in eptember, 1970, that such expansion chould take place, asd, ag
a result thereot, I submitted my letter to him of september 31, 1570. The
Prestdant i kuow in my presence directed Mr. Haldeman to present my
Intter to the Prasident to the gecretary of State for prompt and immediate
. Soneurrence. Leveral months passed, and it was not until Ceeamber, 1979,
that Dy. Kiasinzer inguired of me as to what had kappened to the expansion
ef ow foreign Haison which the President had anproved being expanded in
september, 1870, YWnen [told Or. Kissinger that this matter bad been
delayed in the tate Department and that F hed been awaiting word for approval
of the same by the Searetary of State, Or. Kiewiazer stated he would personally
take this mafier ap with the President nnd that I would receive in a few days
the State Departruent's approval of the expansion of our foreten Haison,
keveral days later in becembker, 1976, i received a telephone call irom .
Seeretary of State Rogers stating that the President bed epeken to hira about
the expansion of our foreiga Baisoa operations and that he was in full accord
“with the same with the exeaplion of the opening of an office st Helsinki fa
view of the ponding negotistions te be carried on there by representatives
of the Russian Government aud the United States Government concerning
the Himfiation of acme. As 1 have previously indicated in my memorandum
to you, } concurred with the suggestion of the Kecretary of State axd countered .
with the racoamendation that instead of opening an offica at Helsinkt,. we open
ae office at Copeningen, with which the Secretary agreed. .

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. SULLIVAN

 

I have given very careful consideration to your memoranda of ;
June 7, 1971, and June 16, 1971, together with the memorandum of j
Mr. Wannall of May 27, 1971, which was initialled by you; Mr. Wannall's ;
memorandum of May 28, 1971, initialled by you; my letter to the President
dated September 21, 1970, initialled by you; your memorandum of
September 22, 1970; Mr. Brennan's memorandum of September 21, 1970,
initialled by you; and also Mr. Child's memorandum of May 33, 1969,
analyzing the work and the accomplishments of our various foreign liaison
offices and the problems incident thereto, together with the recommendations
of Messrs. Dalbey, Felt, and Beaver upon the recommendation made in your ;
memorandum of June 7, 1971, suggesting the closing down of a number of i
the foreign liaison offices, some of them recently established last December
with your approval. . {

First and foremost, I want to clarify a point you have raised in
your memoranda, namely that our foreign liaison offices, with the exception
of Mexico City, are not operational and that we cannot develop "hard, high
quality, positive intelligence by sending men to these countries only in a i
liaison capacity." We do not have the legal right to establish any foreign
offices on an operational basis. The law specifically limits foreign intelli.
gence operations to coverage by the CIA, and, therefore, we have known
all along that our offices in foreign countries could not be in an operational
status.

I cannot agree that establishing liaison offices in foreign coun- |;
tries without being operational prevents us from developing hard, high quality
and positive intelligence. Certainly in all memoranda prior to your memo- |
randum of June 7, 1971, you did not indicate any such reservation and, in :
fact, you specifically initialled the memorandum of Mr. Brennan addressed j

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: FURTHER DOCUMENTS PERTAINING TO
THE FBI AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

NOTE CONTINUED:

The Confidential material attached includes Wannall
to Miller memorandum, 11/4/71; Miller to Rosen memorandum,
11/26/71; Wannall to Miller memorandum, 12/9/71; and letter
from the Undersecretary of State, John N. Irwin II to Mr. Hoover
dated 12/20/71. The Bureau memoranda were classified on 6/5/75
since disclosure of the fact that the 1971 expansion of the FBI's
foreign liaison program was for the purpose of collecting foreign
political intelligence could damage existing diplomatic relations
between the United States and foreign countries involved. Further
it could seriously damage existing cooperative relationships with
foreign police and intelligence agencies.
