M/R: a. On 17 May 1977, the Director proposed in a memorandum
to the DCI that the DCI assume responsibility for acting as the
focal point for requests for intelligence information from any
Committee of the Congress which does not have direct oversight
_ responsibilities. This proposal included the recommendation
that the channel of communications for such requests should
be through a designated individual on the IC Staff and that
responses to the Congress should flow back through the same
person, providing the DCI, on behalf of the President, the oppor-
tunity to review what intelligence information is made available
to the Congress. The DCI has never responded to this memorandum.

b. Instant memo recommends that an agreed procedure be
developed between the Executive and Legislative Branches which
would set forth the terms and conditions on which sensitive .
cryptologic or other intelligence information would be provided
to the non-oversight committees. It also recommends OSD GC
assume action on R/S 5507 and provides background information
on two Congressional requests (references a and c) for SIGINT
information now pending in OSD. .

c. Deadline on R/S 5507 response to Ms. Siemer extended
to 4 January per Col. Steve Harrick, ATSD(LA), and Mr. - -Bob
Andrews, OSD (GC).

. da. Mr. Yeates, Exec DDO, and Mr. Brady, GC, concur.

SUMMARY OF SUBCOMMITTEE ON INT ERNATIONAL OPERATIONS - x

 
   
   

On 6 May 1977, Senator George McGovern, Chairman/of the Sub-
committee on International Operations, Senate Forei Relations
Committee, sent a letter to NSA informing the Agengy of the Sub-
committee's pending.investigation into matters refating to (1)
the activities of ‘intelligence agencies of forej4n nations in
the U.S. and foreign- sponsored surveillance, harassment or intimi-
dation of private persons, and (2) efforts by/foreign interests to
influence official U.S.- Government policy. e understand that a
similar letter was sent to the Secretary on/1l5 June.

Since that time, Mr. Michael Glennon,/ Legal Counsel for the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, visitéd NSA on 15. June to
explain in more detail the scope of the Gommittee's investigation

of item (1) above: (a) whether intellidence agencies of foreign
nations are engaging in harassment, intimidation and surveillance
of foreign nationals here in the U.S.;/(b) against whom these

activities are directed; (c) who is. pérforming these activities

on behalf of the intelligence agencieS; (da) how often it occurs

and (f) to what extent U.S. intelligence and law enforcement:
agencies may be "cooperating" with gr "acquiesing”™ in. this activity
This information will, according to/Mr. Glennon, help the Com: mittes
evaluate the extent to which intel¥Yigence agencies of foreign :
nations can conclude that their activities are condoned. He

stated that it was his intention tp talk also with the FBI, DIA,

and CIA, and we understand he has /done so.

NSA made ho substantive contgibution during this” visit since

'Mr. Glennon did not hold an SI clearance.

Mr. Glennon did not ask for information on efforts by foreign
interests to influence U.S. Government policy at this time and
no search was made for SIGINT on this, aspect of the Subcommittee's’

Divesttigebian..

The Dinector, “NSA, “reviewed these reports on 17 November:
and said they were not to be shown to or discussed with Mr. Glennon
until the memorandum of understanding betwéen the Executive branch
and Senator McGovern on behalf of the Subcommittee on International
Operations is executed. Mr. Glennon was so advised in late

November and again. in early. December. °

MEMORANDUM .FOR THE HONORABLE DEANNE SIEMER, GENERAL COUNSEL,
" DEPARINENT OF DEFENSE

SUBJECT: “Pending Congressional Requests

reo

REFERENCES: (a) 15 December 1977 letter from Senator George
. McGovern to Secretary of Defense

(b) Undated letter received on 20 December 1977
.from Congressman Louis Stokes to Director, NSA

(c) 16-December 1977 letter from Mr. Ira Nordlicht
to the Honorable Deanne Siemer

. 1. ‘Beferenced letters iterating PagtieSes for information °
from the National Security Agency present two common issues: -
namely, whether signals intelligence information is to be pro-
vided to Congressional Committees which exercise no traditional
oversight over intelligence matters; and, if it is to be provided,
how it is to be done. NSA Charter legislation, now in draft form,

“would obligate the Director to keep the Committees of the Congress,
having jurisdiction over the Agency, fully and currently informed
of the Agency's activities. Provision of information to other
committees would be responsive to policy developed within the
onimnL ey.

2... We anticipate that requests for information, as illus-
trated by the three referenced letters, will continue to increase
and can present difficulties in maintaining good relations with

' the Congress. While this Agency has been fully responsive to
the needs of the Intelligence, Armed Services, and Appropriations
Committees, we have treated. requests: for information by other
committees ona purely: -case-by— case basis. Several times during
the past two years, Committees .of the Congress which do not have
jurisdiction for intelligence oversight have approached NSA
directly for foreign signals intelligence information. In each
case it has been our understanding that the SIGINT information
NSA has provided to the requesting’ committee is being used as
background information in assisting that committee in formulating
U.S. policy matters. On these infrequent occasions, NSA has
responded directly to the requesting committee providing either
access to SIGINT product or briefings, as required.

Sie Regarding these three specific requests, inclosea for
your information is a summary of NSA's contacts with Senator
McGovern's Subcommittee, on International Operations.. As indi--
cated in the summary ‘and as discussed previously with Mr. Andrews
of your staff, we have not shown nor discussed any material with
Senator McGovern’ s staff representative pending the drafting of
an approved memorandum of understanding by your office and the
execution of such an MOU between the Executive Branch and the
Senator. :

4, In his letter "received by NSA on 20 December, Representa~
tive Louis Stokes, Chairman of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations, requested certain information from NSA relating
to the Cuban intelligence network during the period 1959 - 1964.
Chairman Stokes also certified that access to any NSA material
would be restricted to those staff members with a TOP SECRET
security clearance; access to NSA material, of course, requires
indoctrination for SI as well. No response has been made to
Chairman Stokes' correspondence pending resolution of how NSA

   
 
   

is made, we recommend that any SIGINT information selected for
the Select Committee on Assassinations be provided only by the
DoD or DCI as part. of a larger submission of data and that the
SIGINT be properly sanitized.

5. Mr. Ira Nordlicht's 16 December letter to you requeste
information from NSA on the flow of oil to South Africa and
Rhodesia. At the time of his initial telephone’ call, Mr. Nor alicht
had a TOP SECRET clearance. It is our understanding that he has
since been indoctrinated for SI/TK by DIA. While any SIGINT
pertinent to Mr. Nordlicht's request may contain unique informa-
tion, it must be emphasized that SIGINT alone may be incomplete

or misleading unless it is examined in the context of all-source
intelligence information. In this instance, after the execution

of a suitable MOU, we recommend the requested information be
furnished by ‘the’ DCI combining the SIGINT with other materials

/

“available to him. You may recall that earlier this year the

Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy requested and was

‘provided information on Arab. foreign:investments and the lifting

and ‘sale“of Saudi and.Iranian.oil..This is the information which
was provided specifically to:Mx. Jerome Levinson, then counsel

of the Subcommittee, and which subsequently formed the basis for
a 20 June 1977 letter from Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the
Subcommittee, to the Secretary of State citing "...a substantial
discrepancy between CIA and NSA estimates of Saudi crude oil»
exports in the first quarter of 1977." This charge was repeated

Coe eee Serial: wNoo15

by Mr. Levinson in an ‘article by Seymour M. Hersh appearing

in the New York Times of December 25, 1977. Mr. Nordlicht

 

stated hig present request is not related to the previous
inquiry. —

6. The lack of an MOU or “other agreed. procedure for Signing
with requests for.SIGINT from other than the three teen Se iene
oversight committees mentioned above has severely hampered NSA
ability to be responsive to the Congress. We urgently recommend
that an agreed procedure be developed between the Executive and
Legislative Branches which would set forth the terms and condi-
tions on which sensitive cryptologic or other intelligence
information would be provided to the non-oversight committees.
In the absence of such an agreement with both the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and the House Select Committee on Assassina-—
tions, we cannot respond to these queries. -We also recommend

_that your office so advise Congressman Stokes and Mr. Nordlicht

and also determine a proper response to Senator McGovern
consistent with the President's instructions.
