SUBJECT: Leon OSWALD

Leon OSWALD
dpob:

Physical Description as of 1963:

Appeared to be an American.
Visited Ms. Sylvia ODIO at her apartment in

Dallas, Texas on 26 or 27 September 1963.

Ms. ODIO said that when the three men visited her
apartment, the one who appeared to be an American was
introduced as Leon OSWALD. She later said that the
following day, after the initial visit, Leopoldo phoned
her and "mentioned something more about OSWALD, but that
he (they) never mentioned the name OSWALD; they referred to
the American, or Leon." (Comment: has this ever been
sufficiently clarified. Did any of them ever mention the
name OSWALD, or did Ms. ODIO assume it was Leon OSWALD.)

a. There are no records on the Cuba Desk under
the name Leon OSWALD.

b. Attached, of possible interest, are traces on
one Roque Antonio DALTON Garcia, an American/Salvadorian,
who used the alias Jose Olividio PUENTES Leon in DGI work

in late 1963. Photo attached.
