SUBJECT: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT HAV-29

 

Captioned criminal informant, who was formerly SU 351-C,
has been residing at Calle 7 #230, Vista Hermosa, Camaguey, Cuba.
Discreet inquiry on February 27, 1958, established that this
informant has left Camaguey and apparently has returned to the
United States. Indications are that he does not intend to return
to Cuba. The exact reason for his departure is not known; however,
it is known that he was associated with NORMANXROTHMAN , FBI _ #135858, ,
and some of ROTHMAN's business ventures in Camaguey have been |
unsuccessful. In addition, there have been increased revolutionary ,

~
{

   

activities in the central and eastern part of Cuba and informant
may have felt insecure residing in Camaguey.

    
 

The Salt Lake City office is requested to discreetly
contact reliable sources in Las Vegas to ascertain if the informant
has returned there and advise the Legat, Havana. Two extra copies
| of this letter have been prepared for forwarding to the Salt Lake
‘ City office (137-356).
