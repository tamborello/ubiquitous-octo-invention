ifornia, to attend a club meeting during which time he had a short con}
“versation with ROSE CAMARATA, wife of ALEX CAMARATA, who also attended
the meeting. ROSE said that her mother, JENNIE MISURACA, had arrived .
from Florida and that she had brought some "letters" from "DADDY JOHN"
(JOHN MISURACA.) one of which wes for the informant. She seid that ALEX,
who also received one of the "letters", was supposed to contact informant
to give it to him: however, he wants nothing to do with the "letters"
and refuses to'even talk about them, ROSE explained that when AIZX re-
fused to handle the letters, she took them. to ANGIE GREEN, the daughter
of JOHN and JENNIE MISURACA, in Modesto, California, and that MANNY FIGLIA
now has the informant's letter, : coe ; ; nm ,

   

Informant ettempted to ascertain: fron ROSE CAMARATA what was contained
intae "letters" and why ALEX wes so upset about them; however, due to the i
circumstances he had to depart and he was unable. to obtain additional infor ©
mation. Informant added that he would contact MANNY FIGLIA in regards to !/-<
the so called "letter" for him from JOHN MISURAGA.

SF 2550-C-TE furnished: the following information to SA RUDOLPH H. Man cl NI
on 1/14/69: ; ° of

On. 4/13/69 he contacted MANNY FIGLIA at fan Jose, California. After
a few minutes of idle conversation, he seid that ROSE CAMARATA had advised |!
him JOHN MISURACA had sent him a "letter" or "message" which he (FIGLIA) §
now has. FIGLIA then took an envelope from his pocket, handed it to the
informant and. said, "Here it is. I.think it is something your -* osed to,
sign", Informant noted the envelope to have:been.dpened end to tain
the name of JOHN J. ARDIZZONE,: Attorney at Law, 870 North Firet Street,
Serj Jose, California, in the upper eft hand.corner. He removed the con-
tents noting-it to be three copies of an Affidavit with a place for his
signature and a notary seal at the bottom. He began to read the document |
at which time he heard MANNY say, aS if he were talking to himself, "I did
not went JOE to do this. It's only more trouble", : :

 

 

 

 

  
  

_ After informant completed reading the affadavit, he folded it up, placed
it into his pocket with the envelope and said, "I'll take i "\th me and
look it over again", MANNY immediately replied, "Sure, thats OK, take Ds |
with youl and msde rio suggestion thet the informant sign the document at
that time, Informant asked FIGLIA if the affadavit was sent to him by
JOHN MISURACA and he rather evaded the question by saying, "H, knows all

-about it". At this time, informant was of the opinion that JOHN MISURACA
approved of him signing the document,

   
 

FIGLIA then related that he had an important message for informant to:
relay to ALEX CAMARATA, wae would in turn pass the information on to his {
father-in-law, JOH MTSURACA FIGLIA cautioned informant not to call ALEX |

CAMARATA but to contact nim personally "right awey", FIGLIA said infor- +;
mant should tell ALEX to tell JOHN..MISURACA that if he is ever questioned
in the future by anyone regarding JOHN ARDIZZONE he should not say that
ARDIZZONE is not known to him becavise ARDIZZONE feels that someone took his
picture as he was leaving JOHN MISURACA's residences,

Informant did not question FIGLIA as to when the above incident might
have occurred; wever, he surmised that it was in the recent past during
which time ARDIZZONB took copies of the affadavits back to JOHN HO SURACA™
for his approval and, perhaps, to induce him to,sign one. — ™

;

On L./14/69 informant visited the CAMARATA residence in. Martinez, Cal- |
ifornia, at which time ALFX CAMARATA, ROSE CAMARATA, JENNIE MISURACA’ and |
ANGIE GREEN, were present. As they were all seated around a .table-in
conversation, ROSE CAMARATA asked informant. if he had contacted MANNY FIG-~ |
LIA. Informant said he had and withdrew the envelope containing the three i
affadavits from his pocket. He attempted to hand the affedavits to ALEX i
stating, "Did you get one like this". ALEX immediately threw up his hands. 5
"I don't even want to look at it or to have anything to do.with it. I oO
heve. already talked to MANNY about it". informant then said, "Well, DADDY il
JOHN wants us to sign, dosentthhe", ALEX, ROSE, JENNIE and ANGIE all
replied together that this was not so, that JOHN STSURACA does not want —
the documents to be signed or to have anything to ‘do with them.

 

Thformant was somewhat surprised at this because, although FIGLIA : tdi
not make any statements in tiis regard, he had assumed from 3 FIGLIA -that -
the signing of the affadavit had JOHN MISURACA! s approvals

 

Informant then ‘related. to AIEX and others present that FIGLIA wanted i

ALEX to relay a messare from FIGLIA about JOHN ARDIZZONE, Informant re- —,

‘lated his conversation with FIGLIA. stating that ALEX should immediately ;

communicate with JOHN MISURA‘CA to warn him not to deny knowing JOHN ARDIZZ=}

ONE if-he is ever questioned as ARDIZZONE told FIGLIA that he believes he 4

was photograshed leaving his residence in Florida. Informant said that |

| SENNGTE MISURACA, wife of JOHN one te then said, “How can he say he '
doésh*tknow him, he was just there" Informant advised that. this comment...

confirmed that JOHN ARDIZZONE apparently had made a recent trip to Tampa,

_Florida, to visit JOHN MISURACA, _ a a : |

Inforriant. made available a ‘copy of the Affadavit furnished to him by-

MANNY FIGLIA previously referred to which states, in part, that he had been
contacted by two individuals, one of whom identified himself as an agent

of the Federal Bureau of investigation, et wnich time an offer was made to
him to "testify against JOE CERRITO" -in exchance for $10,000, He is quite
certain that ALEX CANRRATA also received a similar document but he hes had .
no opportunity to observe the wording t:at it might have contained, He is
not certain but. he believes. that ANGELO GIAMMONA of Modesto, California,
might have also received suth a document for signing inasmuch as ROSE orig-=}
inally took the affadavit or affadavits to ANGIE GREEN in Modesto for del- ;
_ivery to FIGLIA, possibly by ANGELO CIAMMONA, when ALEX refused to have any
_ thing to do with the matters : . ; -
