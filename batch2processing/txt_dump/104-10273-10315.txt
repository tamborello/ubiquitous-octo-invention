8. Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,
the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JMWAVE. -On
numerous occasions since at least the early 1960's, HEMMING
had clained Agency affiliation when in fact there has be2-7
none, The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such
affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services
to the Dr Enforcement Administration. Gerald Patrick HEMMING
is alo ime cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),
aka: Fraok FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety whoalso has a
long-time record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In
the late 1556's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined ricz2ai CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter

 
      
  

Claiming disillusicnment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thereafter,

STURGIS “organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and
Central American activities which he named the International
Anti-Communist Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was
named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING,.

9. For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of
a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot
involving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
memorandua, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;
and an'extract from a book published in early.1976 written by
Michael CANFIELD and Alan J, WEBERMAN. The book Coup d'etat
in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy
is a diatribe against t the e Agency and attempts to “to link the Agency
with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the major
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,
Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-
nental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
and that members of this unit were connected with CIA, GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISON's investigation.
