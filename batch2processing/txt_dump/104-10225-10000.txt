Enclosure
 

 

15 December 1952

Dear Archie:

I much enjoyed our chance for a talk, and B11] Durkee,
who assists me in the subject we discussed, is tremendously
enthusiastic, as T am, about the possibility that you will
consider favorably the appointasnt Frank mentioned,

Let me stata avain what seems to me most important in
the facts under discussion. The Job is of national and
world-wide importance. It can help achieve greatness, It
can endanger us all. It requires a man of imacination and
igeas but also a man of deep and thouxhtful responsibility
to discharge it well.

I should like you to cansider that T am at your service
at any time to sive you any facts you would like to have ar
any opinions for that matter. All of us here consider that
we would de greatly privileged to be able to help you if you

undertook tha job.

 

Sincerely,

Thomas W, Braden
