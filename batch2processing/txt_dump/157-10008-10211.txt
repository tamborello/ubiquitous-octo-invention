according to plan, and after his second call (due to his hotel porter's —

and later in his room. We had - igo 4

 

restaurant of his hotel,
not at this time located AMLASH, so the time was spent briefing AMMHIP
on the local scene, and on his conduct with AMLASH when they met. The
( . meeting lasted about one anda half hours.

Later the same day we called AMwHIP at his hotel to report
no progress in locating AMLASH . Feeling it advisable to keep AMWHIP
occupied, we took him out to dinner at Fisketorpet, located in the
suburbs of Helsinki. The evening lasted until 1200, terminating with’a

drink at the roof bar’ of the Yaakuna, During the six hours, we had an

 

opportunity to explain. arefully to ‘AMAHIP that in order for us to help

he is attached to AMGASH, and will continue to look upon him in the most
