The sources of income for the Black Panther Party
(BPP) are many and yaried. In the initial years of it
existence from 1966 to 1969, one of its chief sources of
income was the proceeds from criminal acts perpetrated by
individual members who split with the Party, Hore recently,
the chief source of funds for the BPP has been numerous and
regular contributions from individuals, radical groups and
sympathizers in the United States and overseas, These
individual contributions have increased greatly since

to have a listing of sources for such groups as the Black tke

What would be most helpful would be a designation of the group
and then after that, a listing of its income sources in as detailed
and specific a way as possible. It would be much appreciated if
. we could have this information by Thursday, February 26, 1970.
