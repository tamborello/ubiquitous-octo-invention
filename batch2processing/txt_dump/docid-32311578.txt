a)

According to Shelton, about two weeks before the

WS assassination of former President John F,. Kennedy, he was
o SS NS in contact with James Venable, a leader of another Klan
2 S . organization, Venable told Shelton that he was.in contact..
ea |with Lee Oswald and that Oswald had been active in.some :
SAa bombings in Alabama, Venable offered the services of. ‘Oswald
Bay to Shelton and stated he could be used by both ‘groups.
23) Shelton stated he declined Venable's offer and that this
ak declination was made in the presence of Calvin Craig (Grand
EN Dragon of Shelton's organization) and Bob Thompson (Vice
BBS President of Shelton's organization and a racial informant).

Shelton also stated that according to Venable, ‘Oswald was in
Atlanta, Georgia, at a time when former President John F,
Kennedy was scheduled to speak before a Georgia Tech group.

This speaking engagement was canceled and he did not appear

in Atlanta; however, there was some picketing activity in

Hurt (phonetic) Park, Atlanta, and the source got the impression
the Atlanta newspapers at this time contained information or

a photograph that will prove Oswald was in Atlanta at that time,
Shelton further claims that he saw a registration card for

Oswald while he was staying in one of the Marriott Motels in
Atlanta,

4 Memorandum to Mr, W. C. Sullivan
. RE: HOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES .
KLAN INVESTIGATIONS ; .

’

SAC Ponder of the Atlanta Office advised on 11-5-65
| that Robert .Thompson, our informant, stated that no meeting
such as. Shelton described ever took place, SAC Ponder further
advised that at the time of, President Kennedy!s death, there
were numerous allegations that Oswald had been in Atlanta
and these allegations were given considerable newspaper
publicity, The allegations were thoroughly and completely
investigated by the Bureau and found to be false, It is
believed Shelton was aware of the newspaper publicity con-
cerning Oswald being in Atlanta; therefore, he concocted
the above story, It is to be noted that Shelton according
' to‘a Washington Field source believes Venable is furnishing
] information to captioned Committee concerning his (Shelton's)
organization,

RECOMMENDATION :

In view of the above, no action should be taken in
this matter,’
