PERSONNEL RECOMMENDATIONS

Remytels 12/22 and 12/29/67.

Bureau has been previously advised of continuing
investigation by Buffalo Office of LCN burglary ring headed
by LCN member JOHN C. SACCO. our investigation of SACCO
and his associates culminated in a joint FBI and local raid
on 12/5/67 of premises located in Buffalo, N.Y., at which time (-
over $105,000 worth of expensive mink fur coats and fur pieces

were recovered. The loss of these furs and the arrest of ee

JAMES JAY WADE by our Agents and local authorities was a
substantial blow to SACCO and local LCN operated enterprise.
It is also noted that a number of individuals, including
RUSSELL DE CICCO and GREGORY JAMES PARNESS are principal
Suspects in the recent DU PONT robbery in Miami. SACCO's

group is made up of young, hard-nosed Italian individuals
capable of almost any offense.

As & result of my previous recommendations to the
Bureau, SAs JOSEPH E. GRIFFIN, JR. and FRANCIS D. CONNERS
received individual letters of commendation from the Bureau.
because of their handling of informants and developing the
investigation which resulted in the recovery of the furs and
the collecting of physical evidence of assistance to local
authorities in connection with their case.

The purpose of this commmication is to recommend
additional personnel action.

In further developments in the fur case, the evidence
has been submitted to the Erie County Grand Jury by the New
York State Police and by Agents of this office. AS a result

of this testimony, it is expected that JOHN Cc, SACCO, RUSSELL
DE CICCO, DAVID NARDOZZI, GREGORY JAMES PARNESS and STEPHEN
GIARDINA will be indicted by the local grand jury and bench
warrants will be issued for their arrest. Latent fingerprint
examinations by the New York State Police and the FBI Identifi-
cation Division were key factors in these indictments and it.
appears that at long last local authorities will be able to
deal effectively with SACCO and his burglary ving, who as
individuals and as a group have defied the best efforts of
local law enforcement foxy a number of years. This gang has
become highly successful major burglars and as indicated by
their possible involvement in the million dollar BU PONT
robbery, they are major offenders of primary interest to all.
law enforcement agencies.

 

 

_ Follewing the fur recovery, PCI HARRISON T. GALLAGHER
: advised SA FRANCIS D. CONNERS that RUSSELL DE CICCO and GREGORY
JAMES PARNESS had committed the $55,000 burglary of the Pitt
Petri jewelry firm in Buffalo at which time a substantial
‘quantity of expénsive silver piéces and other jewelry items
had been taken. The Pitt Petri burglary occurred on the
night of 11/16-17/67. The PCI also advised that JOHN Cc. SACCO
was the fence handling the stolen goods from this burglary.
It is’ noted that local authorities had been completely
unsuccéssful in their investigation of this burglary in
attempting ‘to devélop suspects.

On 12/11/67, BU 305-C-TE advised SA JOSEPH BE.
GRIFFIN, JR. that SAcco. was feneing stolen silverware along with
. a considerable quantity of ether stolen merchandise and that. he
a believed because of the heat. generated by the fur recovery that
; SACCO would soon be moving his stolen goods to a new location.
Acting on this information, on 12/12/675-SACCO was observed by
SAs GRIFFIN and CONNERS following a rented panel truck to 315
Auburn St.. in Buffalo. Investigation determined that an
vassociate ‘of SACCO had rented the truck under an assvmed name.
‘Despite the fact. that SACCO. and his associate were extremely
surveillance conscious, the Agents were able to maintain a
discreet surveillance and determine that SACCO unloaded a
number of boxes from the truck which were placed in a garage
at the rear of the Property at 315 Auburn St.
