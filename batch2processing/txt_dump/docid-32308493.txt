On. December 4, 1963, HEMMING and twelve of his men
were arrested by United States Customs, for attempting
illegally export arms, and going on a military expedition.
Later the U.S. District Court Judge, Miami, Florida,
dismissed the.case because the U.Ss. Department of
Justice failed to go ahead with the prosecution.

 

In February: 1963, HEMMING collaborated with
Miami Attorney CHARLES ASHMANN, and furnished false in~
formation to the press and the British government con-
cerning the capture of eight Cubans on February 20, 1963
by the Cuban government.

-HEMMING, a 6'6", 26 year old adventurer and
mercenary, is frequently seen wearing a U.S. Marine Corps
Combat suit in downtown Miami; frequently wears a Van
Dyke type of goatee, and is called one of the "Three
Musketeers" by the press, because of his handsome appear
ance, and his flair for wearing an Australian type bush
hat. . :

HEMMING is not cooperative with the United
States government, is a self-styled expert on Latin
affairs, U.S. policy, federal law and guerrilla war-
fare, HEMMING interprets the failure of the United
States government to prosecute him for his violations of
federal law as meaning U.S. government approval of his

activity. , Qu) ’ “4 b
