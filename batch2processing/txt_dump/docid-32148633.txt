ADMINISTRATIVE (Cont'd

 

"possible violation of the entry provisions of Section

1185 (b), it is extremely doubtful whether a jury could be
persuaded to convict Lee of a felony calling for upwards of
five years imprisonment for simply having overstayed his
validated leave in Cuba by some three weeks. Therefore,

it is our opinion that the facts are such as to give no
reasonable assurance of a successful prosecution under the
entry provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1185 (b).

"With regard to a possible violation of the
Foreign Agents Registration Act (22 U.S.C. 611 et seq.),
the only evidence to establish that the subject was
requested by an official of a foreign government to perform
a certain activity within the United States is hearsay in
nature. There is no witness available who can testify that
he was present when such a request was made of the subject.
There is likewise no available witness who can testify that
he was present when the subject accepted money from an
officiai or agent of a foreign government. In the absence
of either of these elements, prosecution under the Foreign
Agents Registration Act would fail and therefore it is our
opinion that the evidence is insufficient to establish a
violation of the Act." :
