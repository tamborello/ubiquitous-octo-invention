( Informant is now in contact with associates of

MASFERRER and expects to meet with MASFERRER and work with
his group in the near future. }¢{A) -

Miami Office considers MASFERRER as, one of the most
important and active persons in Anti-CASTRO activities in
Miami. , ; ;

Informant stated that frequently he has to make
decisions as situations present themselves. Most of the
time there is no. opportunity to call the contacting agent
because time is. of the essence and he. is. with Cuban
Revolutionists.. Informant stated he considered himself
experienced in Cuban Revolutionary activities, personally
acquainted with different individuals involved, knows their
way of thinking, and is, fami, jar with their scheming, ,
approaches, and methods. % “)

Informant said that Anti-CASTRO activity. is. much
more "fluid" then was Anti-BATISTA activities. He said the
A¥iti-CASTRO groups. have many defected persons from. the
former Cuban: Revolutionary groups. There is. much more contact
between former BATISTA officials and former su porters, of
FIDEL CASTRO-then prior to January 1, 1959. S/n)

7 Many of the exiles in Miami from the BATISTA
government were away from Cuba. a long time. When they went
back to Cuba and subsequently defected from the CASTRO
movement, they.again returned to Miami... Many of them..are
experienced revolutionists and are still in a revolutionary
spirit and ready to cogperate with the Anti-CASTRO activities
of the Batistaians. YX¥{m)

Miami Agents who have contacted MM 639-8, state
that his knowledge of the Bureau's jurisdictions and
_interests are excellent. He knows what is expected of him (aes

and how far he is allowed to participate in ‘revolutionary
activities.” He is very experienced and has an exceptional
knowledge of Cuban affairs. | )

Inférmant's future potentiality seems excellent. —
‘It is recommended he be continued. Informant is in constant
contact with the Miami Office. His activities are made
known to and discussed by ™ all agents assigned to’ Cuban
matters. - Informant . has made contact with members of
