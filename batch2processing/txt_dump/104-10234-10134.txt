NOT THINK HE LIKELY BE OF VALUE AS SOURCE, BECAUSE LACK OF ACCESS,

 
  

 

HIS PERSONALITY, OPPORTUNISS, ETC., BUT HE MUST FEEL MORE
THREATENED NOW THAN AT ANY TIME IN RECENT PAST AND PRESUMASLY
WILL BE THAT MUCH NORE APPROACHASLE.

2, IF AMWEST 1 DOES NOT DEFECT OF OWN ACCORD, AND DOUBT HE
WILL DO SO AS LONG AS KE NOT ORDERED HOME, IS HOS INTERESTED IN
DEFECTION OR RECRUITMENT APPROACH? DOUBT HE WOULD BE OF ANY VALUE
OTHER THAN AS DENIAL TO PBRUMEN FOREIGN OFFICE, ‘BUT THIS ALONE MIGHT :
SERVE HOS PURPOSES. THERE IS SOME CHANCE HE HAS OTHER 3LOC
CONTACTS INCLUDING SOVIETS WHICH WOULD 8E OF INTEREST.
