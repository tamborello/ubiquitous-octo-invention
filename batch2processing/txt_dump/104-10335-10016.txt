aviewed the status of the six formal “Additional

. CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS
NOTE FOR: The File RELEASE IN FULL
SUBJECT: JFK Board Requests 2000

On 5 June I called David Marwell to clarify parts of
the Board's first three requests (CIA-1, 2, and 3). The
following points were made:

- Marwell will arranye to have a Board staffer screen
the package of several hundred items provided by the
DA in response to request No. 1 The items consist
largely of HNs and HRs that describe organizations
and appointments. This would preclude the need to
send the entire package to the Board.

- Regarding requests No. 2 and 3, the reason that the
Board has asked us to provide information as to the
the present whereabouts of individuals is to help
the Board determine which names should be released.
For example, the Board may conclude that the name of
‘someone who retired overtly and is living in-the US
could be released, as opposed to someone who retired
under cover and lives abroad.

- If the Board wants to interview someone; a specific
request will be sent to us.

- The background information that we provide on
individuals and crypts listed in the requests is
not considered part of the “assassination record.”
The information is used to assist the Board in its
review of documents.

- On 7 June the Board will hold a “formal” meeting
to review redactions we have recommended.

staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board ~
and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CIA needs to
do nothing further at this time.
CIA-2-5 Complete .
CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches)
CIA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could
be made available by December, 1995. CIA now agrees to make the
records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996.
CIA-7 (Histories)

Mexico City. CIA has shown the Mexico City history to Gunn. CIA will
compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,

which will be processed as an assassination record. Gunn will then
determine whether there are any additional portions of the history that
should be added to the Blakey version. CLA will compile the “Blakey
version” as soon as possible and Gunn will promptly thereafter review the
documents.

Index. CIA has made an index available to Review Board staff and the
staff has identified certain histories that may be appropriate for review.
CIA will make available those histories that are of obvious relevance, and
will raise with Review Board staff any questions regarding the requests
where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin to make
histories available on a rolling basis. Review Board has agreed to review
histories promptly once they are made available. Although it was not
discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,
within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to
make available and those that CLA believes should be subject to further
discussions.

Cram’s multi-volume counterintelligence history. Although Cram’s
history was not specifically discussed at our meeting, the Review Board
staff understands that the history has been located and the Review Board
staff awaits its being made available.

CIA-8 (Intelligence community staff) 4

CIA will provide a report to the Review Board staff within two weeks.

CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)

they appear in an LBJ Library finding aid. CIA will report back on
recommended action to the Review Board promptly.

records available within two weeks.
