Microfilm Material Not Processed for Release (Pending
Discussion with the Board):.

Oswald 201 File - this appears to be a duplicate of the hard
copy 201 file reviewed in 1993. 12+ Reels/approximately
30,600 pages

 

CIA Staff Employees' Personnel Files - Approximately 10,800
pages located on 7 different reels. Request that these file
not be considered part of the JFK collection as a matter of
privacy. Only a small portions of these files have any
relevance to the JFK investigations and we believe that the
documents related to their roles in the JFK story were
released in the JFK hard copy collection. We have reviewed
each of the OP files and prepared a classified summary for
the Board.

Non-Related Material - Most of these documents fall into
three major categories:

 

Individual 201 files : These files cover the entire
period of agency interest or contact with a person. For
individuals who are not "key figures" in the JFK story,
those sections of the file that are outside relevant time
frames or can not be linked to Oswald, the assassination,
the various investigations, or any of the conspiracy
theories have been treated as non-related.

Project/Operational Files: Many of these cover the
complete life of a project. Sections of these file deals
with operations which have no connection with the
assassination or fall in only part of a relevant time frame.
For example there are over 3000 pages on the Mexico City
Photo operation covering the 1960's and 1970's. The only
related material is that falling in the time frame of
Oswald's visit to Mexico City and the investigation
following the assassination.

Cuban Exile Groups/Operations: The anti-Castro
activities of the Cuban exiles in the'uUSs during 1960 - 1963
are considered relevant to the assassination. However, some
of the organizations and individuals members continued to
run operations against Castro into the 1970's. The exile
activities after the assassination are generally not
considered related unless they involve plots to assassinate
Castro, the continuation of pre-assassination projects or
the Garrison Investigation.

Notes:

I did not address the financial records of the CRC that we
are replacing with a summary (need to review again); we will
probably have to wait until we meet with the full board to
get their thinking on summaries.

There are other categories/types of documents that are non-
' related but do not fit in the above categories. For
example, the HSCA requested files on 29 on defectors; they
chose only 11 for their defector sample to be compared with
Oswald. We treated the 11 as related and the rest as non-
related. However, the number of pages involved is small
compared to the above three categories.

CIA JFK Collections

1) Oswald 201 file: 17 boxes (Aug 93/Jan 94 Release)
1) JFK hard copy, 63 boxes (Aug 93/Feb 94 Release)

2) JFK microfilm, 72 reels (currently under review)

The Microfilm Reels contain the files that the HSCA staff
either requested or had access to. A great deal of the
material is duplicative of that found in the 63 hard copy
boxes including the complete Oswald 201 file. There are
also files not related to the assassination story and files
not reviewed by the HSCA.

HGR has reviewed all the microfilm material (page by page)
with the exception of the Oswald 201 file. The Microfilm
collection has been divided into to two parts:

1) documents reviewed for release and being prepare
for NARA (records related to the assassination, the

investigations, or the various conspiracy theories),

2) documents reviewed but being held pending
discussion with the board (see attachment) .
