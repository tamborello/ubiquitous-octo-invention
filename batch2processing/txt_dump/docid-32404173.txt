MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Historical Review Group

FROM: Robert J. Eatinger, Jr.
Assistant General Counsel
Litigation Division, OGC

SUBJECT: MHCHAOS Material Included Among JFK Documents

1. This memorandum responds to Ellie Neiman's request for
guidance on how to process MHCHAOS material found in the
collection of documents currently being processed by the
Historical Review Group pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (ARCA).

2. I recommend that MHCHAOS documents concerning specific
U.S. persons be postponed in their entireties under the privacy
provision in Section 6(3) of the ARCA. The Agency may present
the materials to the Assassination Records Review Boards at the
appropriate time and argue that release of the records should be
postponed because of various congressional statements that the
collection of information was improper. Further, the information
does not in any way help identify President Kennedy's assassin.

3. In addition, specific items of information in the
documents may concurrently qualify for postponement under the
ARCA provisions protecting intelligence sources and methods.
Further, any MHCHAOS files on the National Lawyers Guild are
covered by a settlement agreement that precludes their release to
the National Archives and Records Administration until the year
2025. If you identify any such material, please notify me. I
will contact the Department of Justice.

a

3. I have found no court order mandating destruction of the
MHCHAOS materials. However, the Agency did undertake to destroy
all MHCHAOS material in 1990. However, this destruction effort
was in furtherance of the Agency's routine records destruction
schedule. The collection of documents the HRG is now processing
apparently was never searched for MHCHAOS materials during this
destruction effort. However, the materials in the collection
could not have been destroyed even if found because the
collection was and remains the subject of the FOIA litigation
Allen v. DOD.
