and my thinking might be very much the same. And, of course,

“after the U-2, when you have something like that, I think

Prone (Ares 202) 544-6000

it is only natural that you keep a little bit of a jaundiced
eye on the organization which has done this.

So we made a real point, never to let anyone, even

 

the Secretary of State, get in to see the President unless
one of us were there.

We were not according this privilege with Secretary
: John Foster Dulles.

Mr. Schwarz. In the earlier years?»

Mr. Eisenhower. But those are earlier years than the
years we are covering here.

When Secretary Herter took over in the spring of

1959, General Goodpaster and I tried an experiment. We
tiptoed in behind the Secretary of State when he went into the
Oval office and we got away with it. And from that time on
: we monitored everything.

I saw the document we talked about on the telephone,
I saw the document that indicated 10 minutes where the Presi-
dent was alone with Allen Dulles on the 25th of November
1960. If I had not been made aware of that, or discovered
it myself going through those same black books that you have,
if I had not been aware of that, I would have testified to the
best of my knowledge and belief that the President never

_ Saw Allen Dulles alone.

Mr. Schwarz. We also talked on the telephone about --

I told you the nature of the testimony. We have heard from
an. officer of the Central Intelligence Agency who said that
he had no knowledge of such a meeting, but that he assumed
that Allen Dulles would have spoken to your father about the
Mafia activity, and that the nature of that conversation
would have been speaking in riddles or circumlocutious form.
And I believe we discussed your opinion as to whether
your father would tolerate a discussion which was circumlo-
cutious. It is a confusing question, because your opinion
is that no such conversation occurred. But. getting down to
testing the way in which the person who has testified descrihed
it, and the elements he has put into it, can you cast any
light on that?
Mr. Eisenhower. Now, we are getting into an area of
conjecture in which my testimony would be suspect.
It is very much conjecture. And I would like to point out
that if I were in the position of anybody in this type of
operation, I would certainly have assumed, rightly or wrongly,
that I had some sort of authority from above before I went
ahead and did such a thing. I think ‘it is Only logical
that this gentleman who was testifying would assume that he
had some authority. That is a pretty big burden to take on
yourself. You say, look, it was my idea, and I just went aheoi

and did it.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   
contemplating requesting this opportunity that I would trust

that I haven't gotten so blase over the years that something

Prone (Area 202) 544-6000

like an assassination plan would have slipped my memory.
That is the end of my statement, sir.
The’ Chairman. Mr. Schwarz, do you have any questions?

Mr. Schwarz. . Your opinion is that if your father had

been: ‘told about any CIA activity with respect to Mr. Castro,

and specifically with respect to Mr. Castro and the Mafia,
that he would have told you, and that your testimony is that
he aid not tell you?

Mr. Eisenhower. My testimony is that he did not.

My conjecture, based on the other things he has told me, is

WARD & PAUL

that in all likelihood he would have. But that is only
conjecture.

Mr. Schwarz. I think when we talked on the phone you
said something further in support of that conclusion, unless
“I am mixing up something that General Goodpaster said, which
had to do with your father's attitude toward the control of
the Central Intelligence Agency after the U-2 incident.

Mr, Eisenhower. My guess is that you got that from
General. Goodpaster. But General Paster and I -- after all,
I sat as far away from him as I am from you for two and a
half years, or 27. months, going in -- either he or I went
in to see the President when we were buzzed for on those

things. So, quite logically I think that General Goodpaster's

 

    

AW 53244 DocId:32423432 Page 8
YOu have seen Mr. Gordon Gray, you have seen General

Goodpaster. And when you have me as a third of the trilogy, you

+ Omone (Area 202) 544-6000

will have all of the witnesses who were staff officers who had
access to the President in the latter half of 1960 on national
security affairs.
As such, I was told by my father of the U-2 in 1956. This >
i ae four years before it went down. From the time of reporting
to the White House in 1958, as General Goodpaster's assistant
I was shown the flight plans of the U-2 up until the time that |
the U-2 went down May 1 of 1960.

I say all this only to establish that the relationship

between my father and I in confidences was. very close, par-

WARD A PAUL

ticularly during that period. And that is my first point.

And the second is pure and simple, thatnothing ned and,
of course, my exposure to the White House -- can be construed
in my mind in the remotest way to mean any Presidential knowl-
edge of or concurrence in any assassination plots or plans.

I wouldn't say for one moment that there weren't plenty of
plans being dreamed up in various agencies. I was a member of
the Joint War-Plans in the Army Staff, Army General Staff

we made contingency plans for all sorts of things. Like the

umpire said, they ain't nothing until I call them. And to

 

the very best of my knowledge absolutely nothing came-to the
White House.

And I said in a letter to Senator Schweiker when I was

The Chairman. The hearing will come back to order.

Mr. Eisenhower, would you please stand and take the
oath?

Do you swear that atl the testimony you will give in
this proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

Mr. Eisenhower. I do.

TESTIMONY OF JOHN s. D. EISENHOWER -

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Eisenhower, I understand from your
conversations that you want to make a statement, and as I told
you, we always go through a procedural matter in the first
place, which is, first would you just state your full, name and

address for the record.

'
Mr. Eisenhower. John S. D. Eisenhower, 111 White

House Road, Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.

Mr. Schwarz. And then the second thing is, as I told
you, we always ask all our witnesses if. they know that they
have a right to counsel, and so forth. :

Mr. Eisenhower. I am aware of that, sir.

Mr. Chairman, my opening statement or my whole statement
is first of all to say how delighted. I am and how complimented
I am that you all allowed me to come here.

My motivation, of course, is that I understand that a

lot of the testimony that is before this Committee is getting

into matters of a somewhat conjectural nature, and perhaps

 

Page 5
=

bmane {Ares 202; 544-6000

I am most appreciative to have the opportunity to come,
as I know you all are busy.
I realize that in a situation like this the only prob-

‘lem that I am addressing, of course, is the possible Presiden-

tial involvement in any planning, say, the latter part of 1960, _

: planning for the assassination-‘of any individuals, not
only thinking in’ terms of heads of states or governments, but
any individual at all, Presidential involvement. .
I realize that I would be somewhat of a suspect witness

in a case like this, being the. son of the President at that time.

But I would justlike to give a couple of facts that might have

WARD WR PAUL

a bearing.

The facts are that to a very lagge extent throughout
our adult years my father -- is that the correct terminology? --~
confided in me to a very large degree. As an example,
in July of 1945, the evening he returned from the Pottsdanr.
Conference to Frankfurt, he told me .about a new bomb they
had invented thatmight shorten the war but which might have
some terrible consequences, namely, the atomic bomb, which
was dropped sometime after that. -

Of course, you realize that this was secret. Whether ne
was correct in telling me things like that or not I don't

know. But it is factual.
