The attached carbon copy of
our memorandum to our Miamt
Field Office was forwarded
along with subject's 201
file to your office for
processing into his 201
folder. Apparently the
memorandum became separated
during processing and was
returned to this office
yesterday. Per our conversa-
tion this date, request |
you process this document”
and have it filed in
subject's 201 folder. Thank
you very much for your
assistance.
