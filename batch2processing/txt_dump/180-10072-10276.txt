Herald Tropic Section April 4, 1976 with photo. Notriety could

bring attention and compromise transaction. Thomas said he was

upset about HEmming's behavior; will keep Hemming in background.
Will get another captain for vessel. Hemming knew all about the
plan. Hemming recently conned someone out of money as an advance
for a book, which resulted in the publicity.

Report 4/6/76 by Fredericks.

Meeting 3/31/76 with Hemming, Thomas, Fredericks, Marin, unidentified
male. Hemming said smuggling organization of which he and Thomas
were members, concerned about security of the operation.

Hemming making arrangements to see boat in Panama, which will be
used as collateral for $20,000 loan from Fredericks to Thomas.
Hemming said he didn't want boat identified becasue Fed agents placed
transponders on bottoms of suspect vessels. Hemming didn't feel

it was warranted for Fredericks and Marin to see boat. Hemming

said boat belonged to "organization! Stressed main consideration

for all transactions was security. People "down south" would wait
until all details worked out before load would be delivered.

Captain had decided job offer involving activities in Africa in order
to handle this losd for Thomas and his associates. Hemming warned
Thomas against saying too much. Added that at least 50% of crew

would be "their people" -- that way they had greater control.
Fredericks asked Hemming how he could be sure load wouldn't be seized
O in S. America. Hemming replied that 99% of money and equipment

going to Colombia actually used to combat guerilla activity. Since
Congress would never condone aid to S. American countries earmarked
toward settling of internal conflicts, assistance must therefore be
ostensibly provided for narcotic interdiction, but actually used

for other purposes. Hemming said high government officials in

South America receive bribes to protect major drug traffickers.

Said that "head man in the country neighboring Colombia is directly
involved in facilitating drug smuggling. S$. American authorities
compiling statistics to please U.S. authorities by arresting "free-
lance operators" and seizing their loads. Well connected groups have
nothing to fear from L. American authorities. Fredericks inquired

as to quality of Hemming's contacts in Latin American government.
Hemming replied that they were the best possible. ‘Thomas added that
Hemming's connections were good due to Hemming's extensive experience
in S. America.

Hemming said it would be strictly boat operation. Dummy corporation
could be set up to avoid problems if trouble arose and ties between
Marin, Frederciks, and Thomas' $20,000 loan were found. Delivery time
30 days after payment of $20,000. Hemming refused to allow them

to meet captain but would look into other ways to reassure Fredericks
that plans were going correctly.

HEMMING FILES -- DEA SUMMARY
O During the course of an investigation of Benton F. Thomas,

DEA undercover agents were also able to work up a case against
Hemming based: on Hemming's presence at three meetings where

plans for smuggling cocaine were discussed. Hemming was arrested
August 23, 1976 and found gulity of conspiracy to smuggle

cocaine and marijuana on November 23, 1977.

Part of Hemming's defense was an attempt to show that
Hemming was actually working in cooperation with the DEA,
naming Lucien Conein as his contact. Conein documented his
contacts with Hemming, which began in May 1975, when Hemming
just "showed up" at Conein's office with information on drug-
trafficking. During the WerBebl-Nardi trial in September 1976,
Hemming visited Conein daily while Conein was hospitalized
with a stroke. He passed a "resume" to Conein before Conein's
departure from Miami, which contained "code words, cryptonyms,
and pseudonyms" unknown to Conein, in an effort to make it
appear. that he had a prior contact relationship with the DEA
through Conein. Unfortunately, the Hemming file did not include
a copy of the above-referenced "resume."

Investigative reports show that Hemming may have obtained
the contraband while on a mission -of' mercy to Honduras sponsored
by Soldier of Fortune magazine, then’ smuggled the narcotics to the U.S.
in a DC-3. The narcotics allegedly came. from Colombia.

From the files it appears that’ Hemming is mainly interested
in arms-smuggling, while Thomas was more directly involved. in narcotics.

O (Hemming only attended three of the twenty meetings.with Thomas
and DEA undercover agents). The undercover agents were also able
to obtain background. information on Hemming, Thomas and their
operations such as the following: ' : ;

-- Hemming claimed to be part of a larger “organization"
and have excellent connections in Latin America. He
said 99% of the money and equipment going to Colombia
was actually used to combat guerilla activity. Since
Congress would never condone aid to South American
countries earmarked toward the settling of internal
conflicts, asistance must therefore be ostensibly provided
for narcotic interdiction, but actually used for
other purposes. High government officials in South
America receive bribes to protect major drug traffickers.
The "head man" in a country neighboring Colombia is
directly involved in facilitating drug smuggling,
according to Hemming. Thomas said the smuggling
organization was semi-military in nature and organized
along military lines.

 

-- Hemming and Thomas, who met in the Belgian Congo where

they both served as soldiers-of-fortune, work for
Techpol Security, ostensibly a detective agency which
also specializes in wiretapping, reportedly for black-
mail purposes. Those with connections to this
organization include: Robert Rebozo, Alfredo Durant,

C) a Major Zamora of Miami City PD, and Anselmo Aliegro,
long-time associate of Hemming.

-- Other associates of Hemming mentioned in the file
include Howard K. Davis (noted in an investigative
