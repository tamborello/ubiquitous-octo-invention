and the case officers who were involved:in. these documents
have testified, they say, that Desmond Fitzgerald knew all
about what they were doing, that he was informed that they
were trying to put AMLASH in touch with our teammate in order
to effect AMLASH's goal of assassinating Castro, and that
the case was a very big one, at least in their view of what
the DDP Directorate was doing at the time.

Mr. Helms. Who said Fitzgerald knew all of these things?

Mr. Kelley. The case officers that they were working
