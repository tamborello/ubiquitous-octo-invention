On August 17, 1961, a source of the Pittsburgh Office who
has operated a bookie joint in New Kensington, Pa., for
many years, advised that John Cirigliano, aka Shriggs, had
been delivering the Pan-American Medical Sweepstakes tickets
books for approximately two weeks. He said Shriggs was an
employee of.Gabriel Mannarino and his only function is to
deliver lottery tickets to various numbers outlets in parts
of Westmoreland, Armstrong and Allegheny Counties, Pa.

On August 21, 1961, Walter Sheridan, Special Consultant
to the Attorney General of the United States, requested a
full investigation of the Pan-American Foundation, Limited.

On August 25, 1961, Department of Justice Attorney Kenny
furnished Special Agent Alex G. B,. Radcliffe with a book of
"Pan-American Medical Sweepstakes" tickets, based on the
running of the Dixie Handicap horse race at Pimlico, Md., on
November 23, 1961. The book contained tickets numbered
.216677 through 216688, Attorney Kenny indicated he received
the..tickets. from a source.

On August 25, 1961, the same source of the Pittsburgh Office
advised that on the preceding day, Shriggs stated that the
sweepstakes tickets were selling very badly and that he was
not trying too hard to push them. Source said Shriggs normally
delivered new lottery tickets, including the weekly Arrow

¢ Treasury and Empire Treasury tickets, on Thursdays and
picked up receipts on Mondays and Tuesdays. He said that
during the Thursday deliveries, Shriggs would furnish
new books of sweepstakes tickets on request of any
operator of a numbers joint.

On September 7, 1961, the same source of the Pittsburgh
Office advised that sales of the sweepstakes tickets
were very poor and that in the five or six. weeks he

had been selling them, he had sold only seven books of
tickets. He said Shriggs told him that source and one
other numbers operator in New Kensington were the only
two in that town who were selling the tickets.
