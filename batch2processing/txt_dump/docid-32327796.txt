SAS PETER C, CLEMENTE and EUGENE J. HINDES contacted JACOB
KOSSMAN, Superintendent, 1869 83rd St., Brooklyn, NY. Mr.
KOSSMAN stated that he could not recall ever having heard

of a tenant called RAHE, However, he added that the owner

of the building, MEYER BERFORD, 3036 Avenue U, Brooklyn,

NY, TW.1-5500, may possibly furnish more detailed information.

During September, 1963, NY 3936-C advised
SA WILLIAM A, VERICKER that he had been told the Avon Wreckers
borrowed money from HERB COHN, an accountant, through the
efforts of SAL GRANELLO, The informant said that it was
his impression that GRANELLO had a "piece" of this company.
He stated that Avon Wreckers is presently in serious financial
trouble and that the owners spend the money which normally ~
would have gone to the Government in the way of withholding
taxes, He further advised that COHN indicated that he had
sent or would send a telegram to the District Attorney's
Office complaining of the illegal activity on the part of
the principals of Avon Wreckers.

The informant further stated that GEORGE LEVINE is
owed approximately $20,000.00 by an individual named JOHN
KILEY (phonetic) and LEVINE was trying to collect this money,
since he had an appointment to fly to New Orleans on 9/9/63,
and make a $20,000.00 payoff in a case in which he, LEVINE,
is cAe subject. According to the informant, he questioned
SALLY BURNS about this matter, but was unable to obtain the
facts concerning thisaldeged payoff.

In view of the close association between the
informant, GRANELLO and COHN, no further efforts are being
made to develop additional information relative to these
matters since it is felt that any investigation would possibly
tend to compromise this informant.

On 9/17/63; Mrs. BILL NAITORE, also known as Adaire
Davis, 853 Michael, Park View Island, Miami Beach, Florida,
advised that the whereabouts of SIDNEY and VALERIE MOSS are
still unknown to her.

Mrs. NATTORE said that if VALERIE MOSS had returned

‘to Miami Beach with the children, she would certainly know of

returned to the US. : ‘

enterprise on Staten Island. The informant advised that he

ran into one of CAPPOLA's brothers, an individual known to

him only as JOE, who operates in the Garment Center. According
to the informant, the number YUkon 1-9771, was furnished to
him by JOE for use in placing bets. The informant was given

operation that he had reported in May and June, 1963, which
