On November 30, 1960 a Lisbon daily reprinted an extract from the Cuban

paper "AVANCE" in which all exiled Spaniards were called upon to’ rally round
GUTIERREZ who would lead them to liberate the Iberian Penninsula.<g}

"Bero of the Cuban Army. Arrested in Liége where he met members of
D.R.l.L. who were imprisoned there and offered them the assistance
‘of. Cuban commandoes for the liberation of the Iberian Penninsula.
GUTIERREZ then became double agent and on his return journey to
Cuba stopped in Madrid where he contacted Otto SKORZENY. After his
return to Cuba he continued to act as a double agent and it was ‘he
who suggested the Santa Maria plan to GALVAO. ‘Later on he fled to
the U.S.A. and ig at. present in Texas." .« + ; :

Ww

Be Our representative in Madrid recently received a report that when
news of GALVAO's successful capture of the Santa Maria was received, GUTIERREZ
and seventeen others left in some eraft or other from Cuba intending to transfer |
to the Santa Maria at sea and so proceed to the Iberian Peninsula to start the
"Liberation of Spain"! These plans however went awry with the result that
GUTIERREZ, left short of food and fuel, had no option but to make for the
coast of Florida and there "simulate defection" to the Americans. )

he We should of course be most interested to know whether you have any
corroboration of the above story and, if so, we would welcome any details
you may be able to provide on GUTIERREZ .(5)
