ADMINISTRATIVE:

ALL OFFICES

It still remains quite evident that the best, and in
most instances the only, sources in a position to furnish
information concerning "La Cosa Nostra” arenembers, either: live
or as highly confidential souras,

Those offices. not possessing either category are

‘dependent on fringe associates of members and are not truly

in a position to unqualifiedly relate that a "family" does not
exist in their division, when indications strongly infer one
does, ;

An analysis of information developed by such fringe
associates in most all instances points to a "syndicate",
"organization" or "outfit" that is inclusive of individuals that
could not be acceptable as members of the organized Italian
criminal element because of lack of qualification under existing
known rules of "La Cosa Nostra", particularly that pertaining to
Italian heritage. ;

In view of the past and current successes attained

‘in those offices realzing accomplished development of member

sources, both live and highly confidential, it is incumbant on
those offices not possessing such sources to redouble their
efforts to penetrate the organized Italian criminal element
known as "La Cosa Nostra”,
