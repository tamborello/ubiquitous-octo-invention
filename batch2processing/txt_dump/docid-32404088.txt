Dear Dr. Gunn:

Re: Request for Additional Information and Records
No. CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination Files) and
No. CIA-IR-24 (Defector File)

This is a partial response to the ARRB’s referent
request for pre-assassination files this Agency may have had
on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is believed the following comments
and two enclosed documents fully respond to the Office of
Security questions. The DO response is: pending.

1. At Tab A is a 22 December 1997 memorandum
containing information from the Agency’s Office of Personnel
Security which provides details about the files it had on
Oswald prior to the assassination plus when and why they
were created. These include the Office of Security file on
Oswald, a general file on Americans who had’ defected to
another country and information about HTLINGUAL files.

2. Also enclosed at Tab B is a 27 October 1977
memorandum from the Office of Personal Security which
explains the numbering of that Office’s file on Oswald. In
Particular, it explains why the “missing” volume V may never
have existed.

3. An ARRB staff member has reviewed the Oswald
Security file and the file on American defectors.

4. The Oswald Office of Personnel Security file and
those pages of the defector file deemed relevant by the ARRB
staff member have been forwarded to HRG for review and will
be processed according to current release guidelines.

If you have any questions about this response, please
advise. : :

Sincerely,
