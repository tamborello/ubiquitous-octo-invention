NOTE: CONTINUED:

| audiences both in the U.S. and abroad in an attempt to convince
his audiences that Oswald was, if not innocent of the Kennedy
murder, at least a part of a conspiracy. He. alleged that the
Bureau and other Government agencies conspired to cover up the
true facts concerning the assassination. More recently, he has
associated with Huey Newton of the BPP and various leaders of
the New Left. Within the last year he has been closely associated

(y with Jane Fonda and has, along with her, been a leading antiwar

we

 

activist. (fhe most recent information received concerning him
indicated that he was in\Paris, France, in 3/71, where he made

a number of contacts with! Vietnamese, revolutionary organizations,
and individuals of the Far Left including Alan Krivine, leader

of the Communist League and with a member of the Fourth Inter-
national European Trotskyists organization3|] He travels widely
and his residence has been.unknown for sometime. In order to
establish a logical office of origin in this case and to there-
after consider him for inclusion on the SI, it is desirable that

_ his permanent residence be established.
