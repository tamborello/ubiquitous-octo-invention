fei On 7/8/68, MM 1298PC advised that TRAFFICANTE

was still spending the vast majority of his time in

New York City, where he has been for the past month and

a half. He was in Miami for a period of 2 — 3 days prior

to 6/26/68, when he again left suddenly. While in Miami,

“TRAFFICANTE has been avoiding his residence and his auto-'
‘mobiles, and has been staying at motels and renting vehicles.
Source stated he felt certain that TRAFFICANTE was employing
the same tactics in New York City.

Source states that the reason TRAFFICANTE is
spending so much time in New York City. is because of. the
recent arrest and seizure by Federal Bureau of Narcotics
agents in New York ,of over twenty=two million dollars worth
of raw heroin shippedgin an automobile from Paris to New York.
A New York Italian and several Frenchmen in France were .
arrested in this case. TRAFFICANTE has allegedly told his
Miami Cuban representative, EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL, that
"we" lost ten million dollars due to the New York arrest.
