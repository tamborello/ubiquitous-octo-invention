“Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

“LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta- -

’ tion received word that the ‘photograph of the “unidentified man” was
. being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

. graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the ‘same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in-the middie of

“the block ‘south. It had a planted view of the front gate of the Soviet ©

Embassy. LICALLA, the third Photographic site, was located in one of a
row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

: purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by. a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

“and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was. then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips: “LICALLA ‘film was
originally processed in the Station but in early (1959) due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

which used Tate model cars and a pane? truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
“interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes. )

re photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have

that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters
for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed

case of lazings on the part of the Soviet case officer (which
in my view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know vhat he was’ talking about).
