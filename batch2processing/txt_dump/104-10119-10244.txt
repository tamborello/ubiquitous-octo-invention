and wae the subject of a request for a Covert Security Clearance to per-
mit his use on QKENGHANT. However, the division cancelled prior to
the issuance of the clearance requested for him. A chock on him at the aq
FBI st that ime was NIC. In August 1961, Evan THOMAS was again of j
interest ae one of the individuals at Harper Brothers whe were to be in- 74
terviewed regarding a book which Pawel MONAT, @ 166824, intended to
publish, which was highly critical of CIA and the FBI. EB was hoped that
publication of the book could be stopped but there is no indication in
THOMAS's OS file as to whether it was or not.

 

4. Alan Uriel SCHWARTZ, ¢ 168207, a 35 year old partner in

the law firm GREENBAUM, WOLFF, and ERNST, § EE 6832, who ac-
companied STALINA to New York, was of interest'to WH/UI in February
1958, at which time it was indicated that he was employed by Morris L.
ERNST in GREENBAUM, WOLFF, and ERNST. Edward 8. GREENBAUM
ig a senior partner in this firm, 28 also ia Morris L. ERNST, § 167982
and EE-6832-A. There is much seriously derogatory Informationen «i s
ERNST, including the fact that in December 1939 he attended a secret
meeting at Communist Party headquarters in Chicago, Mlinois, at which .
time he was identified as the Counsel of ACLU in New York City. Alan 4
SCHWARTZ, who apparently was brought inte GREENBAUM, WOLEF, |
and ERNST by Morris L. ERNST, is said in the 1967 volume of Martindale- q
Habbell to be a graduate of Yale University Law School, to have written . o
-Censorship—the Search for the Obscene with Morris ERNST, and to have
been Counsel to the Radio and Television Committee of ACLU since 1959.
ht is interesting to note that in March 1958, Security recommended against
ERNST's use in connection with the GALINDEZ case} and that WH/Il's 4
interest in SCHWARTZ, at the same period of time, was

‘to review some Cuban government files in connection with (a) 4
cage being handled by firm of C-68017." A notation on C]/OA‘s request a
for a PCSA on SCHWARTZ reads "On 24 Feb. '58 Me mea 4
CI/OA advised that upon Subject'’s return to New York ° a@ppro- i
priate division will contact him there on a fhirly continuing basis." : a
There is no further indication in SCHWARTS's file as to what use has ;
been made of him. SCHWARTZ in 1957 was registered as an Agent of the
Dominican Republic in connection with his employment by Morria L.
ERNST, Special Counsel for that country; and he was also registered some- ag
time during the period 1955-1959 as an Agent of the Dominican Republic a
in connection with his association with a William H. MUNSON.

' J. Reference is made to the attached clippings regarding
Svetlana STALINA, which reflect that the editor of the book she has
written is to be Evan Welling THOMAS, 2nd, the son of Norman
THOMAS; and that its translator is Mra. Priscilla Johnson Mac-
MILLAN, aka: Priscilla Mary Post JOHNSON, § 71589 DL, who is
also currently working on a book with Marina OSWALD, widow of
Lee Harvey OSWALD. The then Priscilla JOHNSON was of interest
in the OSWALD case, in that she met Lee Harvey OSWALD and inter-
viewed him in Moscow soon after his arrival there and renunciation of
his U. S. citizenship. After the assassination she wrote a number of
articles about him. ; :

2. Priscilla JOHNSON's file makes no mention of her marriage
to George MacMILLAN, a free lance writer, and no check on him has
been made. She was Security disapproved for staff employment in 1953
because of her questionable associations and activities, and in 1956 a
request for her clearance aa a legal traveler in the USSR (Spotter) was

furnished that office. She was again of operational interest in 1958, but
the Division again cancelled. She was granted a covert security approval
on 3 May 1963 to permit SR to debrief her concerning her contacts while
in the Soviet Union. a. :

3. STALINA‘'s lawyer is Edward S. GREENBAUM, #354817, re-
garding whom no summary bas ever been prepared but whose reference
cards indicate the possibility of question as to his political sympathies.
GREENBAUM also representa Harper and Row who will publish STALINA’
book and who also published William MANCHESTER's Death of a President,
which was edited by the above referred to Evan THOMAS who is the Subject
of @ 164032. His file, which fails to indicate that his father igs Norman
THOMAS, reflects that in 1957 he was associated with Harper Brothers

to be one of the largest public relations firme in the world, was of interest
im November 1957 and again in May 1960 in connection with peralstent re-
ports that it represents the interests of the Japanese Socialist Party in
the United States. In Novernber 1957, the Prime Minister of Japan was
attempting to find out whether or not the reports were valid; and in May
1960, FE/JAO/OPS advised that that office wasdn receipt of information
that the firm was registered with the Department of Justice a an agent
of the Socialist Party ef Japan and requested information as to the nature —
of the relationship, the identity of the individuals involved, etc. Each
time, Security advised that HILL and KNOWLTON, Inc. had assumed
contrel of Edward W. BARRETT and Associates, Inc., & public relations
counseling firm, in March 1955; that this firm served as public relations
counsel for the Office of the Consulate General of Japan from October
1953 to March 1955, and that HILL and KNOWLTON bad continued this
relationship "to the present time" (January 1958). It was noted that HILL
and KNOWLTON also represented the Sues Canal Company, the Societe

de LExposition Universelle et International de Bruxelles, and the Develop-

- ment Beard of the Bahamas. In 1956 the firm announced the formation

of a new public relations firm HILL and KNOWLTON INTERNATIONAL
with headquarters in The Hague and offices in Dusseldorf.

publisheraof STALINA's book, ia that ‘in two Indices cards, copies of
which are attached.

8. The individual who appeare to be masterminding STALINA's
visit te this country and the publication of her book is George F. KENNAN,
#31883.(0 & C), Gormor U. S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Ik was
he who recommended Priscilla Johnson MacMILLAN to HARPER and

‘ROW as one of five Russian-spesking experts. Mr. KENNAN seems to

be acting in concert with Edward 5. GREENBAUM, who became STALINAS
personal counsel after visiting her in Switzerland.
