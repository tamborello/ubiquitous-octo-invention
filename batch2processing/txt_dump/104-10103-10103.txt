2. - ‘All the information is from the same.source, a Polish emigre ©

“who knew SZULC personally and also had, informants in the Polish Embassy. .
“3. - ‘There is little doubt that SZULC was pro-compunist at the tinie,
_ and that he co-operated with Ignacy SACHS, a cousin who was employed

by the Press Section: of the Polish Embassy, and provided him with

"information" « ». It would, however, be unwise. to jump to the conclusion.
that this collaboration took the fora of espionage, since SZULCs does
not seem to have made any secret of the relationship,

  

i an find no evidence that Tgnacy SACHS was an intelligence:

; officer, but he seems to have been an active propagandist. He returned

to Poland in 1954. A report from the same source, dated June 1956,
stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute

for International Affairs.
