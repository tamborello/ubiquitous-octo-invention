DL T-3 advised on! May14, 1970, that JOE CAMPISI and
his brother, SAM CAMPISI, have been known to him for many years, -

JOE CAMPISI takes some bets atthe Egyptian Restaurant which he
runs, He primarily handles bets during the football season,
JOE and SAM also arrange big dice games, some of which he (DL F-3)
has attended, These games are made up mostly of Jewish gamblers,
DL:T-3 caught JOE CAMPISI’ trying to cheat in one of these games
about a year ago and they had some harsh words. Since that time
they have been cordial in their meetings but he does not trust
the CAMPISIs in any gambling game. DL T~3 was asked if he
believed CAMPISI, or anyone with outside hoodlum support could
organize and control the bookmakers and gambling in Dallas.
He replied that in his opinion this would be virtually impossible,
He said the bookies in Dallas are independent operators and have
been for many years, He does not see how anyone, no matter what
his financial backing or hoodlum connections, could control
more than a few of the bookies in this area. One reason for
| this is the fact that only a few of the bookmakers in this area
| are Italian, Those who are not Italian would not be impressed
or intimidated by Italian hoodlums such as CARLOS MARCELLO, He
said that asfar as he knows there is no La Cosa Nostra organization
in Dallas at this time,

 

DL T-4 advised on June 2, 1970, that he has visited
CAMPISI's Egyptian Restaurant from time to time recently. and
although he has not been able to establish that any booking
is going on in the restaurant he has learned that JOE CAMPISI
has been getting some hot tips on some horse races and has been
bettingiall he can get down ‘on them, CORKY CAMPISI, SAM
CAMPISI's son won $1,700 on the Kentucky Derby. CORKY is both
betting and booking, c

CHARLIE MC NATT recently placed a $3,650 bet on a
horse with JOE CAMPISI. DL T-4 does not know whether CAMPISI
handled this whole amount or whether he laid some of it off,

The telephone number at the Egyptian Restaurant that
is used for handling bets and any booking business is TA 7-771l.
The other number at the Egyptian, TA 7-0355 is not used for
anything but regular restaurant business,

DL T-~5 advised on June 15, 1970, that JOE CAMPISI had
a burglary at the Egyptian Restaurant on the night of June 13-
14, 1970, during which the floor safe was opened and $10 , 000
taken, CAMPISI told DL T-5 he had $2,000 insurance on the loss
and noted there was no visible damage to the safe, DL T-5 asked
