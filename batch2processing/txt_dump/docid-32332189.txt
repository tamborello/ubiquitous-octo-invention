name in registering at any hotel and she has always called him
at various hotels under his own name.

Informant said that on the weekend of July 25, 1958
a conference was held in Room 1313 of the Manhattan Hotel, New ©
York, with MARTINEZ and Cuban Rebels in attendance and it was
shortly after this that RUTHFORD was to go to Cuba to pull a
demolition job of President BATTISTA's ammunition. She did not
know any of those in attendance at the meetingsince she was not
there,

Informant said she once tried to’reach MARTINEZ at
the Ponce de Leon Hotel in Miami and was given the number
Franklin 32988 where he could be reached in Miami and when she
called this numbér MARTINEZ answered. On another occasion when
she called this number the person answering said it was the
Bel Air Corp. and MARTINEZ was unknown there.

FRED L. BAILEY advised on October 16, 1958, that on
October 13, 1958 on Flight 737 from Cleveland to Miami and Flight
145 from Miami to San Juan, MARTINEZ and BONIFACIO were
passengers on this flight. On October 165, 1958, on Flight 749

“from Cleveland to Miami, and Flight 145 from Miami to San Juan,

MARTINEZ and RUFINO were passengers on this flight: to arrive
in San Juan at 1:00 PM on October 16, 1958.

_ MARTINEZ is known to Canton PD as former attorney who
frequently passed worthless checks and it is reported that his

.parents have paid off $20,000 in worthless checks which

making this clear to her. At this time MARTINEZ also asked
her to obtain $20 which a friend owed him and send it by

Money. Order to him at the main.office of Western Union, New —
York, which she did. He promised to send informant the $340
he owed her on October 11, 1958 but to date it has not been re-
ceived.

Informant said that she had no definite information that
, MARTINEZ was responsible for the theft of instant weapons at

the Canton Armory but when she read it in the newspaper she

immediately thought that he would be the logical person to
dispose of such a quantity of arms and that he possibly had done
so to make up for the weapons he failed’to get when he lost the
$30,000 ‘given him by the Cuban Rebels for this purpose.

. Informant stated MARTINEZ flew everywhere he went,
doeS not own a car but on September 11, 1958 whenhe visited
her in Canton he was driving a 1957 two-tone green Cadillac,
bearing Ohio license N-224-T which he had borrowed from a friend
in Canton. : :

oO Informant said that in early September, 1958 she re-
“eeived a telephone call from two individuals identifying them-
selves as THOMPSON and MARDIGO and they were interested in learn-
ing of MARTINEZ' whereabouts. She refused to give them any

. information. On September 15, 1958, while driving to her home
she was forced from the road by two men in a black Packard ~

bearing Ohio license, number unobserved, who again asked her
about MARTINEZ! whereabouts and she refused to gtve them any
information. She said she was offered $5,000 for this in-
formation and the men stated they had seen her in MARTINEZ!
company the weekend before in New York, which informant stated
was true. ‘When she refused to tell them anything they slapped
her around before letting her go. When she later told

MARTINEZ of this he asked her why she didn't report it to the
police, to which she replied if she had done so she would have
had to tell them all she knew about him. :

Informant said MARTINEZ has access to a private
plane because he flew from Miami to New York on the occasion
that he went to Toronto. While tn Toronto they stayed at the .
Conroy Hotel’ registered under the names of SALLY KRAJCIK, and:
LOUIS MARTINEZ. She stated MARTINEZ has always used his. own

the motel.

Another friend and close associate of MARTINEZ is NICK
TRIKILIS, who is the owner of the Air and Air Corp., Wooster, Ohio.
She said that TRIKILIS is also interested in the Cuban Rebels cause.

.Informant states that MARTINEZ spends much of his time in
Miami, Florida, and usually stays at the Ponce DeLéon Hotel or the
Dupont Plaza. He has told her that Castro's Cuban Rebels are paying
for his expenses. _ :

; _ Informant stated that FRANCISCO BARONA ALONSO, who is
supposed to be the next president of Cuba when CASTRO is victorious,
was also in Canton, Ohio, at the same time that MORALES was there.
ALONSO stayed at the home of PAUL CALVO, who lives on the northwest
corner of Rice and Third Street, NE. On the day after ALONSO was
there she drove MARTINEZ to CALVO's home and he entered the house and
returned with a small package which MARTINEZ carried to his parent's

home about 3 houses away. She later drove MARTINEZ to Cleveland to Oe a
catch a plane for Miami. Sometime after. he had made the trip he
told informant that the package he obtained from CALVO contained a
bomb which he had taken in his suitcase on the plane for Miami.
Informant stated that MARTINEZ usually took Eastern Airlines Flight
736.from Cleveland Hopkins Airport to Miami and took a plane from
Canton-Akron, Ohio, Airport if he was flying to New York.

 

- Informant stated MARTINEZ frequently visited the Spanish  /0/U%
Center in Canton, Ohio, when he was in Canton and once during the
pest summer when the Spanish Fiesta was held, MARTINEZ was accompanied
by a@ young boy who made a speech in an effort to solicit funds for
what he termed a Cuban Educational Fund for students. The collection
was not fruitful and MARTINEZ later made a comment to her that: those i

in attendance were not interested in helping their own kind.

: Informant advised that a man she knew as MIKE DUGAN or
‘> DUNCAN waB also in Toronto with MARTINEZ and his group when they
‘purchased the surplus planes. . She stated this man was from White
Plains, New York, Telephone number, WH 8-9430. Informant said
MARTINEZ had given MIKE her telephone number at one time so that he
could contact her for MARTINEZ if necessary. ‘She added that MIKE was
supposed to buy a surplus army "Duck" which he was going to convert
for his personal use. ;

Informant said she had seen scraps of paper belonging to
MARTINEZ in which notations appeared thereon concerning purchase of .
B.A.R. surplus rifles. She said that she had also heard MARTINEZ
mention that he was making contacts somewhere in Brooklyn, NY for the
purchase of B.A.R. rifles for the Cuban Rebels.

“he

Informant indicated that MARTINEZ had mentioned
that he intended getting medicinal supplies in New York for
MORALES and was going to pass MORALES off as a medical student.
Informant said she presumed from the conversation that this was
to involve a large shipment of supplies to be destined for the
Cuban Rebels, —

: Informant stated that MARTINEZ was promoting the
building of a Pan American Building in Cleveland, Ohio but that
Cleveland officials were not interested and he later tried to .
get such a building erected in Miami, Florida. MARTINEZ advised
such a structure would promote better harmony among the American
countries. The backing for such a building was to come from
Insurance Companies in South America or the United States.
MARTINEZ made frequent trips to Caracas, Venezuela, and in
July or August 1958 he called from Miami and said he was going
to go "across the water" which she took to mean Cuba. She said
MARTINEZ has stated that he met with CASTRO, the head of the
Cuban Rebels, in the past.

Informant said that although she had no definite in-
formation she would presume that any arms which were transported
to Miami from New York would end up at the Trade Winds Hotel,
Miami, which is where FRANCISCO BARONA ALONSO stays while he is
in Miami. It is informant's opinion that ALONSO spends most of
his time in Florida.

Informant said MARTINEZ has an associate in West-
chester, New York by the name of TOATER (Ph).
; yr

Informant stated MARTINEZ owes her $340 which she -
has loaned him over a period of time and she has been seeking
repayment of this debt since she broke up with MARTINEZ,

She said MARTINEZ called on September 9, 1958, and
said that he was going to up-state New York and then to Miami
and would be in Canton, Ohio on Monday or Tuesday, October 13
or 14 and he didn't want her to tell anyone where he was going
to be. Informant stated that MARTINEZ was explicit in telling
her that he was going to be in up-state New York and then Miami,
then Canton, and she did not know why he made such a point of

She has known for some time that MARTINEZ has been working on behalf.
of the Cuban Rebel forces to obtain arms and equipment for them.
MARTINEZ, who is an attorney has told informant that he is legally
engaged in this activity and assists the rebels in obtaining export
licenses for equipment. — - :

One associate of MARTINEZ is MARTIN RUTHFORD, 535 W.111th,
|New York City, who is an industrial engineer for some enterprise
company. .RUTHFORD's telephone number is ACademy 2-0872, and informant

has determined MARTINEZ's whereabouts on previous occasions by calling ©

RUTHFORD. RUTHFORD is a demolition expert, having served in this :

capacity in the Armed Forces and was to do a demolition job for Cuban’
“-~Pebels on ammunition supply of Battista’ Government. RUTHFORD was to

receive $375,000 for this job, half of which was to go to MARTINEZ.

. _RUTHFORD is described as male, white, 6'2", blonde hair,
' fair complexion, 36, wears black patch over right eye, has even white
. teeth, medium build. , C

Informant advised that MARTINEZ's activities on behalf of
the Cuban. rebels has only come to her attention since March or April
of this year. - a ‘

Another associate of MARTINEZ is PETER LEBLOVICH, Montclair,
New Jersey. Several months ago LEBLOVICH was supposed to have given
MARTINEZ $30,000 to obtain weapons, which was lost. Informant stated
that MARTINEZ has blamed her for the loss because he was coming to
Ohio to see her after receiving this money so he gave it to another
fellow who was to complete the transaction for the weapons. Either.
‘the money was stolen by this individual or lost in some manner because
MARTINEZ has been held responsible by the Cuban Rebels for its loss,
and they have apparently been pressing him for the money or the arms.
Informant said that in June, July, or August, 1958, MARTINEZ was in
British Honduras checking on the $30,000 for the-man who had it had

on one occasion MARTINEZ showed her a check for $27,000 which
LEBLOVICH was supposed to have given him. She said MARTINEZ was
prone to boast when he was doing well but if things were going badly
for him he was not talkative. .

‘
Informant continued that in either July or August, 1958,
MARTINEZ was in Toronto, Candan, negotiating the purchase of 10
surplus righter planes. MARTINEZ had invited her to meet him in
Toronto, which she did. She said she saw these planes which were

‘silver in color at the Municipal Airport in Toronto. MARTINEZ had
‘engaged 4 Panamanian pilots to fly the planes from Canada; but

although they were permitted to travel to the United States, the
Canadian Authorities would not allow them to enter Canada to pilot
the planes from Toronto. Informant stated that it is her understand-
ing that the planes are now in New Jersey, possibly around LEBLOVICH's
home, but she was unable to furnish information as to how they were
piloted there. —

os While in Toronto, two men from Milwaukee were there with
MARTINEZ. One whom she knew as "VIC" had his wife with him. "VIC"
was 5'3", 60 years of age, thin build. The other she knew as MERLIN.
She gathered from their conversation that both were American indus-
trialists, and that possibly the surplus planes had been purchased.

. from "VIC." She said that "VIC" claimed to have lived in Canada at

one time, formerly served in the Canadian Air. Force, and had an
expensive home now in Milwaukee

Informant stated that in the three years that she dated
MARTINEZ she frequently went to New York for a weekend and usually
stayed at the Edison Hotel. In May, 1958, she went to New York and-

presumed she would stay at the Edison Hotel; however, MARTINEZ

obtained a room for her at the Manhatten Hotel. She stated that.the
reason for this was that MARTINEZ was meeting with a group of. men
whom she assumed to be Cuban Rebels at the Edison Hotel, and for this
reason he had her stay at the Manhatten so as not to involve her in
his affairs. She stated that. one of the men meeting with MARTINEZ

had also brought his wife and she,‘ too, stayed at the Manhatten Hotel.

She did not recall the name of this woman, nor did she know the names
of any of the men meeting with MARTINEZ. .

Informant stated that whenever she was with MARTINEZ she was
passed off to others in the group as MARTINEZ's secretary from his law
office in Canton, Ohio. She said that often the people who were with
MARTINEZ spoke Spanish and she, not being able to understand Spanish,
did not know what. they were discussing.

Informant said MARTINEZ told her. that a girl named "BLANCA,"
which in Spanish is supposed to mean the "fair one" was hauling guns
from New York to Miami in her suitcases and was supposed to make these
trips frequently. She said "BLANCA" and JOSE MORALES were in
Canton, Ohio, in April or May, 1958,.and stayed at the Ambassador —
Motel. She stated MORALES is also working for the Cuban Rebels cause.
MORALES and MARTINEZ left the motel while she and "BLANCA" stayed at
