feel sure that further such actions are going to

"Gentlemen:

"I take the liberty of urging you to place yourselves
in contact with the Office for the Protection of the
Constitution of the German Federal Government, Office of
the Foreign Ministry in Hannover,

"On March 17, 1964, I submitted to the above office
certain data and information which should prove very
interesting also to you. They might have a direct bearing
on the causes of the assassination of your President Kennedy.

"The indications I furnished are of great significance
inasmuch as I believe to have dependable information to the
effect that these ‘guided actions’ will become particularly
important in the near future and will undoubtedly occur.
