NOSENKO CASES

OPEN CASES

1. F75-6669/WEISBERG

This request number covers several requests concerning
the JFK assassination. One query involves the Warren Commis-
sion's interest in NOSENKO. Though F75-6669 is still an open
appeal request, WEISBERG will not be furnished with additional
Agency documents until he pays the Agency the money he owes--
over $1000.

2. F77-0417/SULLINS

This is the first request which ‘asked for all information
on NOSENKO. As the Oswald 201 file contained some documents
relating to NOSENKO, the processing of this request was halted
while the JFK/Oswald review was taking place. Some documents
from that review could now be released to SULLINS, but his
request must still be referred to CI Staff, as they hold a
large number of documents pertaining to NOSENKO and his handling
by CI Staff in the 1960s.

wistaken) beret IPD has been holding this request in
the istaken) belief that DDO has been actively working on
processing NOSENKO files.
