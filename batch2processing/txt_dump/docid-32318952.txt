The Section proposes that 20 of these employees be
temporarily assigned to this project for an 8 week period
beginning in July. Thereafter, an assessment will be made as to
how personnel will be obtained for the second eight week period,
tentatively scheduled to begin in September, which is mentioned
in recommendation number 2. It is possible that some field
analysts may be required to fill personnel needs, but the
progress of the work and budgetary constraints will be important
factors in any recommendation.

To capture costs of this project, a separate cost code,
1581, has been obtained. Salaries will be paid out of the
existing general FBI budget, since employees would be on board
although in other assignments, if this project did not exist.
However, other costs, such as overtime, supplies, and equipment
will need designated funding. '

We are unable to assess overtime needs now, but will do
so as the project progresses. o

In order to make maximum use of summer employees now,
we believe that ten or more, with college experience, can be used
on the project, if available.

Supplies such as paper, pencils, folders, etc., have
been obtained from existing stock, and will be replenished as
needed. The initial cost is $1,492.54.

Computer equipment ( 6 desktop computers and 2 laser
jet printers) has been requested. Its cost would be
approximately $33,000.

Enclosed is a copy of G. Norman Christensen to
Mr. Greenleaf memorandum dated 5/22/92 captioned as above.

The Director has decided and advised Congress that all
material concerning the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy (JFK) not previously requested under the Freedom of
Information Act and placed in the FBIHQ Reading Room would be
reviewed. Due to our present budgetary constraints,

Mr. Greenleaf wanted to have a Task Force handle this project
with the least amount of funds being used.

To accomplish this, it was decided that former Freedom
of Information-Privacy Acts Analysts would comprise the JFK Task
Force and conduct this review. These people will be needed in
the next couple of weeks. On Pages 6 and 7 of the enclosed
memorandum, you will find a listing of employees in your
respective Divisions and Office that will be used on the Task
Force.

Please have your respective personnel contact Section
Chief Kevin O’Brien’s office, extension 3625, to determine the
exact time period they will need to report to work on this Task
