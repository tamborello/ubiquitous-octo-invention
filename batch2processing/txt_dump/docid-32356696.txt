Interpen (Inter-Continental Penetration Forces). HALL,
who was in.California at the time, was able to locate
HEMMING through the reporter.

 

i : HEMMING related that on his return from Cali-
7 fornia to Miami in February, 1963, HALL accompanied
him, and after arrival in Miami, HALL attempted to asso-
: ciate himself with various anti-CASTRO groups to organize
: ; action on several revolutionary ideas of HALL, including
7 one to invade Haiti. None of the groups at Miami took
os HALL very seriously, considering him somewhat of an un-
.veliable character.

: HALL eventually associated himself with a

4 Cuban named MANUEL "MANOLO" AGUILAR. Together with
AGUILAR and several other Americans, including WILLIAM
SEYMOUR from Arizona and TOM DUNKIN, a Florida newspaper-
man, HALL participated in an infiltration attempt against
Cuba but they were arrested by U.S. Customs while still
on the highway in the Florida Keys. At that time U.S.
Customs confiscated what equipment the group had, but

no prosecutions were brought against HALL or the other.
individuals involved. HEMMING stated that the latter
incident occurred some time in late 1963. |

During the summer of 1963, HALL and LAWRENCE
"LARRY" HOWARD, an individual of Mexican-American descent
who was in-Miami at the time, went out to California
where they were able to raise funds and obtain some guns
which they then-brought back to Miami. HEMMING recalled
that they had approximately 16 Garand M-1 rifles, which
they converted to automatic rifles. HEMMING said that
these weapons were confiscated by U.S. Customs on the. .
highway in the Florida Keys when HALL and his group were
reportedly preparing to leave for Cuba. :

LORAN EUGENE HALL

HEMMING advised that HALL has not been in Miami
' since approximately November, 1963, when Customs made the
seizure of equipment. He said that HALL left Miami with
LAWRENCE HOWARD, who: was reportedly now in Vera Cruz,
Mexico. HEMMING did not know if HALL went to Mexico at
that time but. he recently saw MANUEL AGUILAR, now a
member of the anti-CASTRO group Ejercito Rebelde in Miami ;
and AGUILAR said he had recently heard from HALL, who is
still in Los Angeles. ;

HEMMING stated that HALL is about 32 years of
age and is. married to a woman who once was the secretary
to the President of Cessna Aircraft in Wichita, Kansas,
but as of February, 1963, when HEMMING was in Los Angeles,
HALL was residing at 285 N. Oakland, Apartment 9, Pasadena,
California: At that time he was employed by the Ernie
Porter Chevrolet Company in Pasadena.

HEMMING. related that HALL and LAWRENCE HOWARD

-when en route from California to Miami in the summer of
1963 with the converted Garand rifles, were held by the
‘Dallas Police Department for possession of narcotic
medicines. HEMMING believed that HALL and HOWARD had

been able to obtain. such medicines from doctors in Cali-
fornia on the basis of their propesed military action
against Cuba, which would require medicine for the wounded.
HEMMING did not know how HALL and HOWARD came to the atten-
tion of the Dallas police.

heard of LORENZO HALL about 8 months ago, at which time
HALL. was reportedly en route to Mexico with LAWRENCE
HOWARD, © MM. T-1 said that both HALL “and HOWARD were
"goldier-of-fortune types" and prior to coming to Miami
in 1963, had raised money, possibly from right wing
organizations in California, in order to support their
proposed military action against the regime of FIDEL
CASTRO, HALL never succeeded in such military effort
in that he was thwarted/by the action of U.S. Customs
at Miami, who seized what equipment he possessed,

; MM T-l expressed the opinion that HALL may
have gone to Mexico with HOWARD, but HALL is not know
to have returned to Miami since .' the latter part of
19 763.

On July 22, 1964, GERALD PATRICK HEMMING , 1036 ©
§8.W. 5th Street, Miami, Florida, who since 1959 has
been active in Cuban revolutionary activities, stated
he first met LORAN HALL, who liked to be called "SKIP"
HALL, in April, 1959, at which time HALL was in jail at
the Axwy barracks in Ciudad Libertad near Havana, Cuba.
HALL was arrested for being involved in alleged prepara-
tioris for revolutionary acticn against Nicaragua. HALL
shared a cell in the Cuban jail with SANTOS TRAFFICANTE ,
well known gambler and hoodlum of Tampa and Miami,
Florida. . .

HEMMING stated he next met HALL in Los Angeles
in January, 1963, at which time HEMMING was visiting
his.family, and while in Los Angeles, HEMMING was inter-
viewed by a reporter from the PASADENA INDEPENDENT STAR

accompanied by another automobile, and a station wagon.

At approximately 1 AM on October 30, 1963, in the vicinity
of Jewfish Creek; U.S. Customs officers approached the
Oldsmobile and boat, and another one of the cars, and
found in the second car a quantity of arms, munitions,

explosives and supplies. The driver of the 1955 Olds-

mobile was-identified as L. E. HALL, 142 S.W. 21st
Avenue, Miami, Florida, who was also the registered owner
of this car. The sole occupant of the other car, a
Mercury, was identified as MANUEL BARBARITO PEREZ GOYANES ,
a Cuban citizen. Customs seized both cars and their con-
tents...

Investigation disclosed that an anti-CASTRO or-
ganization, the Frente Revolucionario Anti-Comunista
(FRAC), had been involved in plans to utilize the PITUSA I
on a trip to Cuba, for the purpose of gathering propaganda
material for the John Birch Society, and to obtain money
to sustain military type raids on Cuba. ,

— On August 6, 1964, Mr. STANLEY SHACHTER, U.S.
Customs Agent, Miami, confirmed that L. E. HALL is identical
to LORAN EUGENE HALL. He recalled that HALL, at the time
of the Jewfish Creek incident, said he intended to to to
Cuba on a raid, Neither. HALL nor his companions were
arrested. oo .

: -At that time HALL had information in his poss-
ession reflecting that he was born January 4, 1930 and re-

‘Sided at 285 N. Oakland, Apartment 9, Pasadena, California..

Another residence address in his possession was for 1191
Collegeview Drive, Apartment 14, Monterey Park, California.

MM T-1, who has. been involved in Cuban revolu-
tionary activities for the past six years, advised on March
10, 1963, that HALL had been in Miami for about the past
three months , and associated with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING,
an American adventurer, mercenary and soldier of fortune.
MM T-1 stated HALL is disagreeable, is not liked by the
other mercenaries in Miami,.is of low moral character,
and appears to have a criminal background.

On March 18, 1963, LUIS BALBUENA, 908 S.W. 5th
Street, Miami, a Cuban exile, advised that his brother,
along with some Cubans and Americans, was involved in
some plan to try and overthrow the government of Haiti.
Somehow connected with this group is an American, LORENZO
HALL, also known as LAWRENCE HALL, a soldier of fortune,
who appears irresponsible and at one time was a member of
the Cuban Rebel Army.

On April 5, 1963, the Miami Office received a
telephone call from a LORENZO HALL, 142 $.W. 21st Avenue,
_ Apartment 6, Miami, Florida. HALL said he understood
that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelli-
gence Agency and Immigration and Naturalization Service
were trying te locate him, and he wanted to report his
address.

On November 11, 1963, MM T-1 said that LORENZO

HALL, a white male, 25 years of age to 26 years, 5'7".

155 pounds, ruddy complexion, was unemployed and had in-
dicated to the informant that he was from Los Angeles,
California. He is always on the move, is in and out of
-Miami, is the confidence man type, and it was not know
if he was then in Miami. MM T-1 advised that HALL
claimed to have been in the Cuban Rebel Army, but the
other mercenaries in Miami dcubt this .

’ MM T-1 said HALL was then loosely connected with
Cuban revolutionary activities, which he uses as a gimmick
to try and obtain money donations. In Miami, he loosely
associated with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING , "MEXICAN" LARRY
HOWARD and WILLIAM HOUSTON SEYMOUR, all unemployed ad-
venturers,

_ MM T-1 stated HALL and HOWARD made a trip to
California several months previously in an attempt to
collect money by representing themselves as members of an
anti-CASTRO movement. It is doubtful they collected any
sizeable amount of money. Their practice is to contact
local chapters of the John Birch Society, claiming they are
anti-Communist freedom fighters, and ask for money to carry
on their work. They do obtain some money this way, and
use the money for living expenses. ;

In October, 1963, according to MM T-1, HALL and
SEYMOUR visited Dallas, Texas, trying to collect money
donations under the guise of representing anti-CASTRO
organizations. Among the persons they contacted was
LESTER R.. LOGUE, 628 Meadows Building, Dallas, a geolo-
gist. It is unknown if LOGUE. gave them any money.

On December 5, 1963, MM T-1 advised that HALL

“had not been seen around Miami for about a month, and his

whereabouts was then unknown.

ae On November 1, 1963 the United States. Customs
Service, Miami, Florida, furnished a report concerning the
boat PITUSA I, which was obgerved on October 29, 1963
being trailer hauled by a 1955 Oldsmobile sedan, south of
Miami in the direction of the Florida Keys. This car was

detention he met a United States citizen named LORAN HALL,
who was also under detention at the time. HALL, 2 white

in the United States Armed Forces for about six years.

HALL toid MIRO that he had arrived in Cuba in about March,
1959, and had subsequently been contacted by CAMILO :
CIENFUEGOS , a Cuban Rebel Army Commander. CIENFUEGOS wanted
HALL to train a group ef men who were goine to participate
in an invasicn.of Nicaragua. HALL claimed he trained a
group of men on a farm known as La Liga, located near
