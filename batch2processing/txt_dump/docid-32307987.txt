New York files 92-2604 and 106-1054; Baltimore files 92-700

ANTONIO RIPEPI, mentioned herein, is the subject of
Pittsburgh file 92-223.

With respect to BENJAMIN MAGLIANO, better known as
BENNY TROTTA, Baltimore is currently contacting him as a Top
Echelon informant target. His activities have been very
closely followed during the past seven years, including a
three-year period when coverage was afforded by a highly
confidential source. At no time was there any indication of
actual membership in or cooperation with La Cosa Nostra on
the part of MAGLIANO, He has admitted being friendly with
FRANKIE CARBO, a New York hoodlum who has excercised
considerable control in the boxing world and since MAGLIANO
was interested in scheduling boxing bouts for HOLLY MIMS, a
boxer owned and managed by MAGLIANO, he, MAGLIANO, had to
maintain a friendly relationship with CARBO. Although it is
possible that MAGLIANO could have been a member of the La
Cosa Nostra without such membership being apparent, it is
felt that the factors indicating the contrary out-weigh those
indicating the possibility.

; Efforts have been unsuccessful to develop, as Top
Echelon informants, a La Cosa Nostra member; however, under
developme s a Top Echelon informant
target is Other individuals who,

although not suspected members of La Cosa Nostra but who are

of Italian extractionaand acquainted with suspected members,
are being contacted in an effort to cultivate and develop
them into productive informants regarding La Cosa Nostra.
Suspected members, MARIO ORAZIO ANELLO, FRANK MALVASO, FRANK
CORBI, were all interviewed as subjects to appraise their

, possibility as Top Echelon targets.

The listed members and suspected members of La Cosa
Nostra in the Baltimore Division, only FRANK CORBI and JOSEPH
GIGLIOTTI, have given any indication. of being engaged in
illegal activities during the past seven years. CORONA,
MORICI and ANELLO are in poor physical health and their
movements are restricted by their.afflictions and old age.
