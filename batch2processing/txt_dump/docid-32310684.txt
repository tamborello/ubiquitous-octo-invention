Rothman told Gray that he felt if he could go to New York and meet with
his contact that he could convince the contact to proceed with the sale of the
. ; securities under the terms set by Gray in Miami, Rothman said he was broke -
so. and requested Gray to loan him the money for airplane fare to New York today. ~
_ Supervisor Nehrbass requested Bureau authority to advance Gray $175 togive
to Rothman for an airplane ticket. :

\ Based on developments to date, it appears that Rothman is only acting
as the middleman in this transaction and it is entirely possible that Gray is
being given the runaround since it is nublic knowledge that he has previously
cooperated with the FBI, Secret Service and other law enforcement agenc{es.
In view of these considerations, the Miami Office was subsequently advised ~
that Bureau authority was denied to advance Gray this money; that Gray

. . should be instructed to inform Rothman that the payoff will be made under pre-
“i %°  apranged conditions wherein good faith money has been deposited in a local
Miami bank,

The Miami Office was also instructed to have SAs Nehrbass and Casey
return to New York today unless there are definite developments indicating
Rothman will produce the securities in Miami.

 

ACTION: a

t

, The Miami Office will submit a detailed teletype today furnishing
latest developments in this matter. .
