TRUJILLO ASSASSINATED

ROSTOW. testified: "the generalized flow of intelligence at that
time involved reports of plots to assassinate TRUJILLO...like

once every week. And why’we had to give guns to people who

had access to guns in the Dominican military I don't know... can't
reconstruct the operation." (Rocky, 178)

ROSTOW moves to STATE DEPARTMENT planning Council

ROSTOW MEMO TO TIIE PRESIDENT RE CUBA
"T have not been following the matter closely over recent
months.'' Discusses "Soviet military deliveries to Cuba."

Under "Covert, Action'': ROSTOW said that the "limited, U.S.-

dominated, professional covert capability against CUBA" does
not promise "a broadly-based political movement capable of
challenging the CASTRO regime's control system." (p. 5, #1)

ROSTOW's Memo reviews Lansdale! s Two-Track Cover Operation:
1. Heightened effort along “present MONGOOSE lines''--inspire
conflict within top of regime. (p. 5, bottom para.)
2... Recruit Cubans, within and without Cuba, to implement
“plan of operation which aims at the overthrow of CASTRO
primarily from within rather than by invasion from without."
Basing outside U.S.; one U.S. adviser "equipped to provide
finance, but not monitoring every move." (p. 6, top)

 

 

Special Group (Augmented) consider's ROSTOW paper. DDCI wants copy.
MISSILE CRISIS -- Mongoose diés.

ROSTOW IS SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS.

 

 

 

Issues and Questions

Guns were tightly controlled
by DR Army. Was ROSTOW
privy to State cable traffic
on this?

Does this argue for assassina-
tion as quicker more direct
approach? Or does it imply that
the "control system” would ont-
-live CASTRO, rendering assassina--
tion pointless? ;

October (Approx.) | BISSELL instructs JUSTIN O'DONNELL to go to CONGO to plan

for the assassination of LUMUMBA (O'Donnell's testimony) -on
initiative of BISSELL without prior White House approval or
knowledge (Bissell, 6/11, p. 55)

CIA's BISSELL, EDWARDS , and O'CONNELL had initiated an

‘assasSination plot against CASTRO utilizing MAFIA contacts

(ROSELLI, GIANCANA, TRAFFICANTE). Lethal cigars had already
been prepared and poison pills were: being developed.

“ROSTOH! appointed DEPUTY ASSISTANT to the PRESTDENT (KENNEDY)

Issues and Questions

BISSELL testified that he told
ROSTOW "'the instruction as to -
O'DONNELL was mv initiative.”
(BISSELL, 6/11, p. 55)

Did ROSTOW learn any of this?

What briefings of new President

and his National Security advisers

took place? Did ROSTOW make
inquiries?

What areas of responsibility?

BISSELL asks HARVEY to establish an EXECUTIVE ACTION capability
under project ZRIFLE, including the capability to assassinate
foreign leaders. The IG REPORT concluded from HARVEY's notes
that BISSELL was "twice urged'' to do this by the White House.
HARVEY meets with SILVER, G GOTTLIEB , and HELMS about it. (IG
REPORT)

Bissell testified: There is little doubt in my mind that Project
RIFLE was discussed with ROSTOW and possibly BUNDY."' (6/11, p. 46)
He recalls that the conversations would have involved the general
capability of perpetrating assassination, "all aspects-of the
creation of the capability” (6/11, p. 50), Bissell said it was
"quite possible" that he discussed CASTRO, TRUJILLO, and LUMUMBA
with ROSTOW as examples of assassination targets. (6/11, p. 50)

BISSELL testified that after Jan. 21, 1961 he met with ROSTOW
“quite frequently and very informally, " occasionally several times
a week. (6/9, p. 81

BISSELL said that shortly after the advent of the JFK Administra- |
tion, there were weekly luncheon. meetings at the State Department
with BUNDY, ROSTOW, CIA, State people and Defense. No agenda.
(6/9, pv. 81) BISSELL testified the "two urgings" from the White
House could have come at successive meetings of this sort. But in
reporting on EXECUTIVE ACTION, he felt that rather than reporting
on developments to the luncheon meetings "as I normally operated
I would have replied more to ROSTOW in this case’) and he feels that
e di ‘report to ROSTOW in this way. (V. I, p. 82-3)

ROSTOW MEMO TO PRESIDENT ; .

"T£ we can devise a policy for dealing with CASTRO short of a
commitment to remove him soon at our military initiative...world
opinion will support us in a policy of. restraint on CASTRO and be
more likely to move with us on SEAsia."' (3)

Issues and Questions

. Bissell said that "presumably"

Harvey's notes are accurate
(Bissell, 6/9, p. 51)

ROSTOW mentions these sessions in

his. book. (169, Diffusion of
Power)

What was ROSTOW's functional
relation to BISSELL?

Assassination meets the
descriptions but it would not
be restraint.
