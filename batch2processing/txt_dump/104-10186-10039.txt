source, A former Cuban IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelligence

Service until April 1964.

The Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of
Intelligence - DGI) docs not make any regular payments to revo-

lutionary groups but pays them only when they have

submitted a

Plan for revolutionary action (armed struggle) and have had it

approved in Havana. Therefore,

there is no standard amount, paid

to any one group or disbursed in any one country per month or
year, and if no armed struggle is in progress or being planned,
no money is given out. Funds expended in Latin America on the

above basis include the following:

Guatemala : During 1963, the OGI paid out about U.S,
$250,000. The Yon Sosa group got about
$200,000 in one year for its activities

Cincluded in the $250,000).

El Salvador 3 In August-September 1963, when the Salvadoran

they received U.5.$50,000, They

revolutionaries were preparing for armed struggle,

used the funds

for propaganda, however, and were not given any
mere because they had, in DGI rerms, misused

the money.

Nicaragua : Durirg 1963 the DGI disbursed some U,S.$15,000.
In addition, the professor, who was one of the
liaison officers in Mexico, won a suit for some
damage from a company (perhaps Pan American
Airlines) and was awarded U.S.$30,000, some of
which he turned over to the guerrillas he

‘ represented,
