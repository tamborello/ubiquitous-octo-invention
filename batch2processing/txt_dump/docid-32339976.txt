ep" Reference Havana letter January 8, 1959. Since the
/” , submission of reference letter, the following information has been
‘LAeveloped concerning the activities of American gamblers | in Havana;

4 . The gambling casinos in Cuba were closed from January 1,

1959, the date of the overthrow of the BATISTA regime, until - |

February. i9, 1959, when certain casinos were permitted to reopen

by government decree. Contacts with numerous sources affiliated

with American gamblers in Cuba indicated that during /the period

gambling casinos were closed very little overt effort was made on ~

. the part of any of the American interest holders to obtain permission

' to reopen. On January 8, 1959, HAV-31 advised that American casino
operators intended to have casinosand hotel employees bring. pressure
to bear on the Cuban Government to permit the reopening of gambling

’, casinos.

Subsequently numerous demonstrations were held by employees
of the various gambling casinos petitioning the government to permit- —
- the reopening of the casinos in order to provide employment for the
~ hotel and casino workers. Permission was finally. granted on
— February 19, 1959, for the following casinos to reopen: Tropicana, |
Sans Souci, Comodoro,. Riviera, Hilton, Nacional, -Capri and St. Johns.
-) The Deauville, Sevilla-Biltmore and Plaza casinos were not granted

permission to reopen.
HAV-31 advised on February 21, 1959, that the government
~. decree allowing certain gambling casinos to reopen had been brought
about by the strong threats made on the part of the hotel employees’
unions to go on strike unless their demands were heard and the -
casinos: reopened. Source -noted that the Cuban ‘Government began
February 11, 1959, to confiscate all ‘slot machines in all. (gambling
