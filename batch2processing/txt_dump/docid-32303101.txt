Miss MIRTA BORRAS ALMANZA, PSI-Under Development,
who has furnished reliable information in the past, on
6/22/65, stated that the JURE would hold a convention in-
Tampa, Florida, over the weekend of 7/3/65. She said she
did not intend to go to this convention, but there would be
delegates from various cities where the JURE has represen=
tatives. . fil

‘Miss BORRAS advised that she did not see anything of
value which might come out of this convention as the JURE was
in a very difficult financial situation and among the Cuban

exiles there is an overall spirit of depression and frustra-
tion. . '

 

Miss BORRAS stated that she would inform the NYO
of any information she received concerning this convention.

The above is being submitted to the Bureau and
other offices for information purposes.
