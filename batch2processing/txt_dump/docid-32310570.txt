ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW
CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM
MIAMI DIVISION’

According to the Bureau's records, your office’ ~

had 133 approved informants as of October 30, 1965. This
reflects a decréase of 7 informants during the past 6 _k

! months. According to your most recent semiannual letter,
Re at the present time your office has 200 individuals under j
ae development which are considered as potential future .,
7 . informants. The personnel in your office handling criminal —
ie matters should give: these potential informants assignments : “
ml whexever possible, and thoy should be contacted as’ frequently w
as time permits with the expectation that several of then :
will soon begin to furnish sufficient information to \
qualify them as active productive informants. ey
. . Se
In May, 1965, Naples, Florida, was designated as a
a resident agency within the Milami Division. To date -no o

informants have been developed in this area. You should
request the parsonnel in this resident agency to concentrate
on the criminal informant program so that informants will i
be developed in the near future, Without’ informants this . &
resident agency may conceivably be handicapped in its

ability to be aware at all times of the over-all. crime picture.

At the present time your office is operating 5 ~
potential informants who have been opened and in a pending -
status for over one year. It is suggested that these 5
individuals be closely followed and given assignments to
see.if the warrant further contacts on the part of your

Agont personnel. At the end of 90 days you should
re-evaluate thair productivity and if they have not furnished
any information of value you should consider deleting then

an active potential dnfermants and have your porsonnel
concentrate on the development of new individuals who

can furnish more valuable information. If these PCis
continue to react unproductively for the next 90 days but.
are woxthy of some consideration, you may, of course,
designate them.as sources of information.

 

In accordance with your recommendations MM 1005-C
and Mil 1020-C may be continued for an additional 90 days.
Aé tho end of that time submit your recommendations for their
retention. If you recommend that they be vetained, furnish}:
the Bureau a brief resume of tha worthwhile information
furnished so that they may be evaluated here at the Bureau.
According to a review at the Bureau, Mil 697-C, MM 1036-C,
MM 1049-C, MM 1032-C, HM 1016-C, MM 1042-C, MM 1048-C and
MM 1052-C have not fLurnished any worthwhile information
during the past 6 months. . Accordingly, it is suggested that
thase informants be given specific assiguments and closely
followed until the submission of your next semiannual letter.
In the event they do not vurnish any worthwhile information
within this next 6 months' pariod, they should be deleted
and the Bureau appropriately advised,

The statistical accomplishments credited to your
informants so far thig fiscal yoar are all higher than tha
sane period in last fiscal, year with the excoption of ©
nerchandise recovered in Bureau casos and merchandise
recovered by other Federal agencies. i¢ is hoped that by -
frequent contacts with your informants additional enthusiasm
can be instilled in them and that in turn will resuit in
assisting your office in bringing up the two above-aeatiened
statistics. .
