SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR.; ExoepEaTNE Est .
DINO CELLINI

Santo Trafficante, Jr., who was born on November 15,

' 1914, at Tampa, Florida, is a known member of the La Cosa

Nostra (LCN). He is also reported to be the head of the LCN
family in the Tampa area and has control of many criminal
activities throughout the State. of Florida.

Set forth is the information available at the Tampa
Division of the FBI regarding Trafficante's activities since
1970, when he first indicated his intention to travel to
Europe.

On November 31, 1970, TP T-1 advised that while in
Tampa he contacted Santo Trafficante, Jr., and Trafficante .
discussed with the source the possibility of leaving the U.S.
and taking up residence in a foreign country. Trafficante
mentioned his reason for doing this was that the constant
surveillance by law enforcement, primarily the FBI, was causing
his wife and himself a great deal of anxiety. Trafficante
felt that if he were to leave the U. S. and take up permanent
residence in a foreign country, it would help ease the nervous
tension on both he and his wife. :

., On July 13, 1973, TP T-2 advised that he had received
information to give a definite indication that Trafficante was
now located in Spain and had been in that count since prior
to the time he was being sought for appearances before a Special
Grand Jury in April, 1973. The source further advised that
since leaving the U. S. and travelling to Spain, Trafficante
had reportedly made at least one trip to Sey for purpose

  

reasons unknown to the source.
