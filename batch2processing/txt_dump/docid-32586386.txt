from unrecalled sources that GERARDO CATANA

‘sent money to Havana, Cuba, for.the gambling

casino in the Hotel Riviera in 1957.’ ,l7lT added that he had
‘not heard any information concerning “Jersey” money going
to the Deauville. .

' 7-17 was asked concerning’ the possibility of ' :
$500, 00. 00. "Jersey" money going to the Deauville Casino.
T-17 reflected that to’ his recollection, the Deauville Casino
isa very small operation and the $500,000.00 would be too
much money for such an operation. .T-17 explained that the
Deauville had two casinos, one in the lobby which is quite
"plush", but very small, and another downstairs, which is a
cheap casino catering mostly to the "Cuban trade. "

T-17 explained that the bankroll for the entire
operation of both casinos in the Hotel Deauville would, in
‘his opinion, be no more than $20,000,00.to $35,000.00.
T~17 went on to say that the Deauville Hotel itself is not
expensive inasmuch as it rents rooms for $5.00 or 6. 00 a
night, and the hotel itself is not elaborate.

On February 25, 1959, T-2 advised SA JAMES P.
O'NEIL that subject had an interest in the casino i tegen OR
