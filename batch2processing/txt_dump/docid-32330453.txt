HOLLOMAN and the subjects was plugged in by one of the sub-
jects immediately after the latter entered. None of the
conversation of the subjects, and only part of the conver-
’ gation of SA HOLLOMAN ‘was understandable in the next, room.
Supervisor ALBAUGH was monitoring what conversation eould
be understood, with one ear against the connecting door, and
the other with an earphone. It was possible thereby to over~
. hear the agreed signal from SA HOLLOMAN to move in and make
; the arrests. Supervisor ALBAUGH, upon entering the room oc~-
| cupied by HOLLOMAN and the subjects, placed one of the sub-
jects (who turned out to be FERNANDEZ) under arrest and
searched him for weapons. ALBAUGH did not recognize him
personally, never having seen him before; however, upon re-
questing his name and comparing his features with the identi-
fication card in his possession, he first realized he must
. be MM-635-S. At this point it was too late to do anything
\ other than treat him as a subject, which was done WAU)

 

\ Previous inquiry at the hotel had revealed GEORGE
VALDES was registered alone. There was no indication as to
f the identity of the person or persons who might accompany
i him to the meeting. Other agents had been assigned to dis-
, ereetly observe the public facilities of the hotel in an
effort to identify any other Cuban intelligence agents who
might be around; however, their efforts produced no affirma- —
eo tive results. It was not possible to observe the room in

i which VALDES was registered without being obvious.
{ CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS :

. , In consideration of the above, I believe that the
i overall handling of this matter by this office was one
reflecting alert and decisive action in which a difficult
problem was resolved without causing a long and costly in-
vestigation.

: Miami determined from the pistrict Director, INS,
at about 4:30 P.M. that MM-635-S was still in custody of

INS, had been in continuous custody since he arrived, and was
due to be released within a few minutes. This information,
therefore, appeared to preclude the possibility of MM-635-S
being involved, inasmuch as being in INS custody, ,he could ;

not have met with VALDES as reported by TAAFFE. KW |

At approxiiiate ly 5:15 P.M., MM-635-S telephoned
SA DAVIS, : stating fie had just been released by INS and was |
calling from a nearby pay phone. The following interroga~
tion took place by SA DAVIS in a further effort to establish
if MM-635-S might be involved’ in the kidnaping plot. MM-
6352S stated he was nearby, put had to leave immediately for
an appointment for which he was already late due to his
detention by INS, and that he was supposed to have called
JOHN EK (phonetic) earlier in the afternoon, that he was
_ spending. the night at. EK's (phonetic). home. SA DAVIS asked
_MM-635-S if he was going to meet any. other Americans that
evening, having in mind the local police officer the Cuban
Agents were scheduled to meet. MM-635-5 answered in the neg~-
ative.. DAVIS then brought up the matter of a meet with
MM-635-S who suggested 8:00 the. same evening. He was ad-
vised that SA DAVIS had two other appointments that evening
and would be busy at 8:00 P.M., but that MM-635-S should
call him later in the evening in case of any urgent develop-
ments. MM-635-S agreed. It was decided to meet personally
the following morning. XU, ,

 

 

‘The fact that MMD635-S suggested an 8:00 P.M. meet
with SA DAVIS on the- evening of January 27, 1960, seemed to
further preclude his involvement in the kidnaping plot, as
the Miami International Hotel meet was scheduled for 7:30

P.M. The probability that he was not involved was made ;nown
to SA HOLLOMAN and SA ALBAUGH, therefore, by SA DAVIS. x)

 

SA DAVIS refrained from volunteering the name of
VALDES to MM-635-S for reasons of security, and at no tine WU)

did MM-635-S mention this name. SA DAVIS did not participate
in the arrests at the Miami International Hotel on the evening
of January 27, 1960. No further contact was had with MM-635-S
by DAVIS until after his arrest, and this office had no

reasonable tt) of knowing about his involvement prior to his
arrest.

i . In mitigation of the informant's position, it is

io noted he has claimed he did-not’ know the purpose of his con-

\ tact with VALDES until after his last contact with SA DAVIS,

\ at which time it was apparently too late for him-to withdraw.

i It is also noted he subsequently explained to SA DAVIS he

} was not thinking clearly at the time he was last contacted by
' SA DAVIS because. of loss of sleep and prolonged questioning by
'Z “ INS; that he would have immediately reported the facts to

| SA DAVIS after the meeting if he had not been arrested. Uy)

}

 

(2) SA HOLLOMAN was aware of the informant's
identity by name only prior to his meeting with. the subjects.
He had no reason to believe the informant would be involved
L and had, in fact, kept in close contact with SA DAVIS prior
; to the meeting in order to determine whether there was any
possibility that the informant might be in contact with VALDES.
There was no indication the informanttwas involved in the |
plot; theréfore, when a man by the Same name came to the
meeting with VALDES, SA HOLLOMAN concluded that if this was
actually the informant, he must be double-crossing the Bureau.
In any event, SA HOLLOMAN concluded. it was too late at this —
point to logically cut the informant out of the conspiracy
without revealing his status to VALDES, and thereafter pro-
ceeded to treat him as a subject. When the meeting had reached
its conclusion he thereupon voiced the agreed signal for the
agents in the next room to move in and make the arrests. Y)

With respect to the microphone installatio:
made in this instance, the following is submitted:

. ; ;
The microphone was installed in room 342 and
monitored in room 340, adjoining. The installation was
made in the following manner: Room 342 consists of a

foyer leading in from the hall, a bath just to the left

of the foyer and a sleeping-sitting area beyond the foyer
and bathroom. The walls are plaster, the ceiling of the
sleeping area is plaster, and the foyer ceiling consists

of fiberglass, acoustical tile approximately 24" x 24"
square, laid in "T' channels in such manner that merely
‘pushing up on them lifts them out of the channel. They are
not fastened down in any other manner. Kn

The microphone was placed in one section of acousti-
cal tile, located as close to the sleeping-sitting area as

the textured finish surface of the tile so that replacing
the tile would make it appear the tile was whole, and no diff-

erent from any of the other tile in the ceiling. Additional
soundproofing material, fiberglass, was placed over the top

of the microphone ta filter out extraneous noises and sound

coming from other parts of the hotel. The microphone leads

were then attached to a section of shielded micrédphone wire,
taped and the microphone wire fed through a hole in the»par- i
tition between the two rooms, and brought out into room 340
through a hole made by removing one of the corresponding

tiles in room 340. The hole in the partition was already

existent as a result of feeding conduit and airconditioning

ducts between the rooms at the time of original construction. KY)

All of the above wire work, of course, was concealed
above the afore-described ceiling in the open space between
the tile ceiling and the actual poured cement ceiling, a
space approximately two feet high. UU"

The tile contaning the Mouse microphone was placed
back into position and the area carefully checked for any
fallen debris that might cause suspicion, and all such
matter was, carefully removed. UA)

In room 340 the microphoné wire was fed into the
input side of the Mouse power supply and the outputs fed,
(1) the 500 Ohm output fed into the 500 Ohm input of a

_Magnecorder tape recorder, (2) the High Impedance output at-
tached directly to a pair of crystal earphones. 34( 14)

 

Preliminary tests of the above installation showed t
it to have better than average pick-up of conversations in ‘
room 342 with, of course, no extraneous noises, such as running
water, radios playing or the television set turned on, any
one of which would tend to decrease the intelligence of any
conversation in the room to a point below usefulness. 4 us

The above installation was made by SA ROBERT E. SUNKEL,
Soundman assigned to the Miami Office, and was completed

approximately two hours before the contemplated meeting. *

series or parallel, cutting these leads might or might not dis-
connect service to other rooms in the hotel. In addition,

in view of subject's expressed suspicions, it was, decided not
‘to. do anything with the loudspeaker at all; if both the tele-
vision set and the loudspeaker were out of operation, subject's
suspicions would most cértainly be aroused.

It is also pointed out that subject was then
occupying a room in the hotel, which was known, and he would
therefore most certaifily be suspicious of any appointments
not in room 342 which he normally would have in his own room.
Therefore, the television set was not removed.

REE

With respect to the three points raised in Bureau
airtel of February 4, 1960, the following is submitted:

_- (1) SA GEORGE E, DAVIS was aware of the kidnap.
plot against MASFERRER, and the possibility that MM-635-S
might be involved was considered; note MM-635-S arrived in
Miami around noontime, January 27, 1960, the same day that
VALDES, an unidentified aide to RAUL CASTRO, and SA HOLLOMAN,
acting in an undercover capacity, were scheduled to meet at |
about 7:30 P.M.. At 12:45 P.M., January 27 : s
advised he had just arrived from Havana and“was being
by Immigration and Naturalization Service, Miami, for question-
ing. No attempt was made by SA DAVIS to, question him at that
time for obvious security reasons. j

 

    

  
  

At about 1:20 P.M., Mrs. CATHERINE TAAFFE tele-
phonically advised-SA ROBERT JAMES DWYER that. she had been
informed by VALDES that an aide to RAUL CASTRO had arrived
in Miami. She.claimed the aide had met with VALDES, and was
anxious to meet with the local police officer concerning the
kidnaping of MASFERRER.
