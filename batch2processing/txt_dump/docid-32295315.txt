former WF 1633-C-TE he could have a copy of the photo if
he so desired. The former source stated it was obvious

to him that such evidence seemed very flimsy as a defense
inasmuch as MARCELLO could easily have switched his coat
to the other arm;or the photographic print could have been
contrived by reversing the negative.

 

WFO is not aware of the facts in the attempted
assault case against MARCELLO; however, it is possible
that MARCELLO and WASSERMAN are claiming the above in the
hope that it might cause the Government to reconsider its
i case against MARCELLO,

UACB, WFO will not ask former WF 1633-C-TE to
obtain above-mentioned. photo from WASSERMAN,

If the above information is disseminated outside
the Bureau, it should be appropriately paraphrased to
protect source.
