MARTIN KATZ, aka
ITSP
Miami File 87-17771
Bufile 87-71448

The installation in the HYMAN MARTIN case, mentioned
above, consists of a 42A MATE. This MATE is currently in-
operative and efforts to remove and replace this 42A MATE to
date have been unsuccessful, It is felt that the security of
this installation has not been jeopardized by the fact that
424 MATES in Las Vegas may have been compromised, At such
time as this source is replaced, efforts will be made to in-
stitute some other type of coverage.

With regard to installations in the offices of
BENJAMIN SIGELBAUM and ALVIN I. MALNIK, in each case a 44A
MATE has been used. Consistent with full security, immediate
steps have and are being taken to remove these 44A MATES since
it is felt their security definitely has been jeopardized.
Efforts will be made to afford another form of coverage,
particularly in the case of BENJAMIN SIGELBAUM.

MARTIN KATZ is a bail bondsman and close associate
of top jewel thieves in the Miami area, He has an office in
downtown Miami in an old building. A 42A MATE has been used.
It is not known that KATZ is in any: way connected with the
Las Vegas group as are SIGELBAUM and MALNIK, and for this reason
the security at this time is unimpaired. It is anticipated,
however, that this coverage will be removed in the not too
distant future as the building wherein KATZ's office is located
is scheduled for demolition.

With regard to the installation at the apartment of
LOUIS SCHRAGER, this is a 42A MATE. It is not felt that
security of this installation has been jeopardized at this
time and in view of this it is recommended that this be left
in, With regard to this installation, it is felt that it can
be removed on short notice.

In every case Miami will continue to be alert to
any factors which will alter the security of any of these
microphones and take appropriate action.
