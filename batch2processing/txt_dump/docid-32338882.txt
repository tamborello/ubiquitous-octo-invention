VII. CRIMINAL RECORD

 

‘there is an unverified report that at a lecture in June, 1942,
before a school of the League of American Writers, Lawson stated that on
the day that Sacco and Vanzetti were executed in Massachusetts, August 27,
1927, he, Lawson had been arrested in Boston for picketing the State 7

1934, on a-charge of criminal-libel growing. out of an article... .
which was written by Lawson.in- the Daily Worker, described.as:a_ Communist
