On 11/24/64, CG 6788-C* advised that a meeting
was held in his presence during which ALDERISIO held a

t concerning the activities of BOB FERRELL and
who caused a female acquaintance of ALDERISIO
oO Swindle ,000 for them on a bo i y deal. CATUARA

present at the meeting on behalf of i ight hand
man and enforcer. CATUARA explaine had no
prior knowledge that female swindler was acquaintance of
ALDERISIO and that FERRELL was most at fault because female
actually FERRELL's girl RELL and “i got her into it.
ALDERISIO instructed FERRELL and CATUARA to return
the $2,000 to the female so she cou return same to ultimate
victims. ALDERISIO told CATUARA he would "make it up to
him in some other way." During the course of this meeting,
it was apparent from tenure of conversation that CATUARA

is taking orders from ALDERISIO and is, therefore, of lesser

stature in the Chicago area organized crime structure than
ALDERISIO, :

A g this meeting, ALDERISIO learned from
CATUARA and{ fat FERRELL had been receiving a 10%
cut of Worldw ortgage Corporation activities through

use of FERRELL's office space at Wheeling, Illinois, where-
upon ALDERISIO became extremely provoked because FERRELL had
failed to turn over any of his 10% cut to ALDERISIO, FERRELL
was ordered by ALDERISIO to immediately get out of the
Wheeling office and confine his activities to First National
Mortgage Company business at Chicago, Illinois.

EIN explained to ALDERISIO a deal between
himself, Ct FIDANZI and the Bank of Nj les,
Illinois, in STEIN with assistance of| Jana
FIDANZI, arranged with the Bank of collect a
$33,000 outstanding loan account. nd FIDANZI
felt they had a commission coming; however, STEIN stated
this collection was not done for a fee and, therefore, no
money was coming to anyone. STEIN, in conversation with

CG 92-350 Sub 1

ee he and FIDANZI had no fee
entailed in s collection. ALDERISIO advised CATUARA
that. some times a favor is done for a bank in order to
obligate the bank to return a favor in the future, which

is of material assistance in the operation of a mortgage
brokerage business.

During the course of the conversation, ALDERISIO
desired to be apprised of the identity and capacity of OTHER 4
and GUS RUBINO in the mortgage brokerage field.

It is noted previous information concerns the
negotiation of a dispute between two factions of the Chicago
hoodlum element. It is further noted ALDERISIO and CATUARA
were not previously known to be closely associated, and they
operate in different sections of the Chicago area.
