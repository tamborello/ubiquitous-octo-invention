MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Administration
Deputy Director for Intelligence
Deputy Director for Operations
Deputy Director for Science and Technology
Chief, DCI/Personnel

FROM: Executive Director

SUBJECT: Request for Assistance/Declassification
of JFK Assassination Records

1. This memorandum requests that addressees identify
staff employees for overtime, after-hours work on Agency
records related to President John F. Kennedy's assassi-
nation. The overtime will be paid by the Center for the
Study of Intelligence. The request stems from a requirement
in the JFK Assassination Records Act that all relevant
government documents be reviewed for declassification and
transferred to the National Archives by 22 August 1993.

2. The specific task for which assistance is needed is
indexing of data into an automated system and ultimately
producing computer-generated forms called "identification
aids." This involves keying in information onto a pre-set
form that appears on a personal computer screen. (Experi-
ence in indexing or as a document analyst is necessary.)

The Act cited above requires that each document transferred
to the National Archives have attached to it such an aid.
The same information that is developed in the aids will. be
produced on diskettes that will be forwarded to the National
Archives for use in compiling an electronic index.

3. We estimate that it will require up to 20 people
working 10 hours of overtime per week, probably beginning in
early June, to meet our deadline. The work will be done in
the office of the Historical Review Group, in Ames Building.
The preferred hours would be Monday-Friday, 1630-1830, or
1700-1900, and there may be work on Saturday as well.
