rly SAC, CHICAGO (92-674) —- ;

SUBJECT: EDWARD Gocrn, AKA, Et Al;
MISSING WITNESSES , SENATE SELECT
COMMITTEE IN THE LABOR OR MANAGEMENT FIELD

 

 

On November 26, 1958, the Bureau instructed the
Chicago Division that the captioned Committee had requested
the Bureau's assistance in locating EDWARD VOGEL, FRANK
LA PORTE and SAMUEL GIANCANA for service of subpoenas
before that Committee. Immediate and continuous attention
was directed towards locating these individuals for the
Committee.

 

On January/:5, 1959, the investigation relative
to SAMUEL GIANCANA, Bureau file 92-3171, was reassigned
to SA RALPH R. HILL at Chicago. During the months of
January, February and March, 1959, SA HILL directed and
participated in over 25 physical surveillances in an effort
to locate GIANCANA for the Committee, many of which were
conducted in extremely adverse weather conditions and
during nights and week ends ‘without regard to SA HILL's
personal problems.

During these months, the Chicago metropolitan
newspapers gave continuous attention to the fact that
GIANCANA was being sought for subpoena by both the Senate
Select Committee ‘and the Attorney General" s Special
Group in Chicago,

The Salt Lake Division advised on January 9,
7 1959, that their informant SU 370-C had developed
information that a S. FLOOD, 6466 Roosevelt Road,
Forest Park, Illinois, had registered at the Desert Inn
Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada, from December 28 to 30, 1958.
. This informantcadvised that through conversations overheard,
Tey she was of the opinion that FLOOD might be identical with~
. ANTHONY ACCARDO, Chicago Top Hoodlum. LS

During the course of this investigation, SA HILL
caused a search to be made of the telephone calls charged
to the GIANCANA residence at Oak Park, Illinois. SA HILL -
was advised by officers of the Illinois Bell Telephone

 

Company on February

call had been made from "Mooney"

24, 1959, that a long distance telephone: it

to GIANCANA's residence, ~

such call originat
. January of 1959.

 

ing at Las Vegas, Nevada during :
This information was furnished to the

Salt Lake Division along w

ith the fact that GIANCANA's

sister's married name is FLOOD,

Arrangements were made.

 

by SA HILL to have a forthwith subpoena forwarded to the |.
United States Marshal's Office in Las Vegas. ao

On March 25, 1959, the Salt Lake Division advised
that acting pursuant to information received from their
informant, SU 370-C, GIANCANA had been successfully served
with the subpoena by an Assistant United States Marshal.

 

In my opinion, SA HILL deserves special st
recognition in the form of an individual letter from the

Director for his enthusiastic approach in developing the —
information that ultimately led to locating GIANCANA

for service of the subpoena, for his perseverance under

adverse conditions and for the sacrifice to his own

personal life to secure the interests of the Bureau in

this matter. -. i
