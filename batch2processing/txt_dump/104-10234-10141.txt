THE ARREST OF THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND THE OUTLANDISH
GARGES BROUGHT AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE CP AND MINISTERIAL OFFICIALS
ARISES FROM THE IRREVERSIBLE FAILURES OF THE GOVT IN THE HANDLING
OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS, THE SCARCITY OF BASIC
FOOD PRODUCTS HAS WORSENED, RICE, ROOT CROPS, MILK, MEAT CONTINUE
TO BE RATIONED SEVERELY, AND THE AVALLABILITY TO TBE CONSUMER IS
- NOW BELOW THE 1957-59 LEVEL, DESPITE SEVEN YEARS OF “COMMUNI ST
PLANNING", THERE? ARE SERIOUS SHORTAGES OF MEDICINE, TEXTILES AND
HOUSING, — THE LATTER HAS DETERIORATED IN URBAN AREAS TO A LEVEL
FAR BELOW PRE-WAR STANDARDS , SIMILARLY, CASTRO REPORTED THAT THE
SUGAR CROP THIS YEAR WILL FALL FAR BELOW THE SIX MILLION TONS
HARVESTED IN 1963. SINCE SUGAR ACCOUNTS FOR SOME 80% OF TOTAL
FOREIGN TRADE EARNINGS, 1966 INCOME FROM SUGAR SALES, FACED WITH
DEPRESSED WORLD MARKET PRICES, WILL NOT IN ANY WAY MEET THE cosT
‘OF BASIC IMPORTS, ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINING THE NATIONAL ECONOMY,
” CASTRO HAS SOUGHT TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON THE ECONOMY BY PER-
