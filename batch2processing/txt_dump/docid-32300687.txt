to Chicago. However, [ __| sata that MANNARINO did not make
any purchase from WOL uring that trip.

On February 27, 1958, a further inquiry concerning
- the officers and directors of the presumably defunct United
‘Dryer Corporation was made at Springfield by Chicago, which

shes. not received an answer to this inquiry as yet.

On February” *25, 1958, ARTHUR F.. SCHWARTZ, an attorney
whp formerly had offices at los West Monroe, Chicago, and who
is now located in Room 500, Westminster Building, 110 South
Dearborn,’ Chicago. SCHWARTZ is a partner of the law firm,
‘Silverman, Blumenthal and Schwartz,.

Re United Dryer Company and oe
United Dryer Sales and Service Compan
Chicago, Tillinois :

On February 25, 1958, ARTHUR F, SCHWARTZ advised
that he had a former client by the name of OSCAR SCHULTZ,
whom he represented in the incorporation of a company called
United Dryer Sales and Service, Incorporated, SCHWARTZ
advised that he was an incorporator of this company and also
had been. Statutory: Agent for it. SCHWARTZ said that he had
rep esented OSCAR SCHULTZ, a man who owned a car wash and who
had.also been in. the coin operated machine business for
‘sometime before SCHULTZ wanted to incorporate in order to
handle the manufacture. and sale of a small, hot air, drying
machine for use in washrooms, etc. .

SCHWARTZ. advised that he thought that SCHULTZ had
hold of a good idea and that he would be producing a good
and saleable product in the 1952-1953 period, SCHWARTZ said
he even got his partner, SILVERSTEIN, to agree to take their
fees in the form of stock in the corporation, but SCHULTZ
would not agree to this, SCHWARTZ advised it developed that
the product was not so good; in fact, the dryer would not work,

However, SCHWARTZ said that he had applied for and
obtained an Illinois Charter-for the United Dryer Corporation
and all he and his partner could manage’ to collect out of it
was that they got their corporation costs from SCHULTZ, but
he refused to pay them their fee, SCHWARTZ pointed out that
