and further recalled that DRISCOLL once left a note signed
by BECK for collection with GILBERT. From the description
of the alleged third gambler who pays frequent visits to
GILBERT in the bank, GILBERT identified this man as S, C.
"CHICK" FLOURNOY (Dallas file 162-164). He stated
FLOURNOY has a loan on the books at the bank. He identified
FRED MERRILL (Dallas file 166-81) as a person he has known
for years and with whom he used to gamble when MERRILL.
operated a house in Rockwall County. He stated that many
years ago he used to keep MERRILL's books. He further
admitted he was acquainted with gambler JOHN BENTON TURNS.

GILBERT was quite vague about details throughout
the interview but after the possible violations under the
federal anti-gambling and conspiracy statutes were explained
to him he became quite upset. He advised it appeared to
him he was being used by these gamblers in their financial
transactions. He stated he would cooperate with the FBI
in any way possible. He stated he would give the matter
considerable thought and attempt to remember specific
details concerning financial transactions of these gamblers
and would keep the FBI advised of any future transactions
and- activities. It is the opinion of the Dallas Office that
GILBERT can be of great value in this investigation if he
is placed in a position where he will cooperate with the
Bureau,
