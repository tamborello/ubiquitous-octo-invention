Dear Nina:

Iam sorry, but I could not leave well enough alone.

One of our reviewers has identified one more--possibly
final--document (two pages) from our microfilm records which
the Department should look at. This one is the minutes of
the 24 November 1964 meeting of President Johnson's cabinet-
level committee set up to act on the recommendations in the
Warren Commission's final. report. We have sent a copy also
to the Secret Service. CIA has no objection to declassifi-
cation and release. David Van Tassel of the National

' Security Council has indicated to us that he will defer to

* the judgment: of State, the Secret Service, and CIA as to the
-release of this material. We don't believe this one will
give you much trouble. .

Please again give us your recommendations.
Thank you again and thanks for your forbearance.

Sincerely,

sk Gon,

NOTE FOR THE FILE:

The attached document, subj: “Meeting of the
President's Committee on the Warren Report, 2] October 1964”
was approved for release, as sanitized, by the U.S. Secret
Service on 2 February 1995.

It was sent to the FBI for coordination by Joe Murphy
on 7 February 1995. Joe advised me on 26 March 1996 that we
must continue to hold because the FBI is not yet into the
microfilm documents. :

The document is being treated as an “Unresolved
Coordination” as of today.

Dear Mr. Laska:

We find we must ask your assistance one more time in
connection with ten documents from CIA's microfilm files
responsive to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act of 1992. All ten are froma file
describing the work of the "President's Committee on the
Warren Report," a Cabinet-level committee set up to act on
the recommendations in the final report of the Warren
Commission. A primary focus of this committee--which
functioned from September to December 1964--was the Secret
Service. :

Mr. David Van Tassel of the National Security Council
has indicated to us that the NSC will defer to your judgment
on the release of this material. CIA will pose no.
objections to the declassification and release of all ten
documents, so far as our equities are concerned. (We will
be coordinating four of these items with other agencies
concerned: the seventh item with the FBI; the ninth with

the Department of State; {and the tenth and qe ovench with the

Department of the Treasury .))
