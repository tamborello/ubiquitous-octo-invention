_ReBulet 12/28/64, granting authority for
Philadelphia to retrieve equipment previously used in
misur coverage, 775 S. 8th Street, and authority to /
reestablish misur coverage at this location. :

On 1/13/65 SA ALBERT L, PIERCE, under pretext
of telephone repairman, retrieved the altered AHA block
at 775 S. 8th Street. SA PIERCE also, through wiring
presently in the building, traced an inside 10 or 11 pair
cable, which appears in the rear room, 775 S. 8th Street,
The red-blue pair of this cable was connected to the out-
side box and presently runs to the CP, Philadelphia.

Philadelphia will continue to maintain the
altered 44A block retrieved 1/13/65 om their inventory.
The missing 44a block described in Philadelphia letter 4
of 12/17/64 is being deleted from Philadelphia inventory.

. Enclosed herewith is a portion of the cover

for the above-described 10 or #11 pair inside cable. It

is requested that Philadelphia be forwarded a Minimite.
This minimite will be installed inside the cable and ac-
cordingly, a minimite of the smallest proportions is needed
for this purpose.

Philadelphia will upon receipt of the requested
minimite install this minimite in the above-described
cable. This cable in‘the building is no longer in use,
has been cut and taped at the end and appears near the floor
of the rear room of this address. It is felt this will af-
ford adequate security. on
