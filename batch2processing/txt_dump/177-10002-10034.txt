The telegram from Emlassy Saigon, No, 523, had just been received and
was read by the group. The remainder of the meeting was given over to
listening to and questioning Mr. Huntingdon Sheldon, Deputy Director,
| Central Intelligence, who had made a special trip to Saigon, and

the Deputy CAS in Saigon. Both of these men had arrived in
Washington that morning, flying directly from Saigon.

The import of Mr. Sheldon's report, which was reflected in cables he
had sent to Mr. MeCone, was that there now exists no capability of over-
throwing the Diem government and that building of such a capability would
take many months if it were decided to initiate such action now,

Mr. Sheldon speculated on the possibility that Nhu might make a deal
with North Vietnam. The hypothesis is stated in the CLA mermorandurn,
attached,

Secretary Rusk was obliged to leave the meeting in order to keep a
White House appointment. However, the rest of the group felt the need
for a further meeting later in the day, preferably with the President,
in an effort to reach agreement on the kind of instructions to be sent ta
Ambassador Lodge. (A limited meeting with the President was held
later in the day.)
