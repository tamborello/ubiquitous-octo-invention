that Julia Cellini was the sister of Dino Cellini who was at one time
connected with gambling casinos in Havanayi, Cuba. By Civil Service

and that he had declined to testify under any circumstances in this matter.

By communication dated September 19, 1966, the CSC
advised that Edward Kiper Moss had been dropped from consideration
before determination was completed.

1953 through 1964, Mr. Moss had numerous tax Hens and suits filed .

, against him fer nonpayment of debts. (65-61021 and 121-39985)

ae Our files contain no additional pertinent information -

Civil fingerprints were located in the files of the FBI
Identification Division which may be identical with those of Edward K.
Moss. These fingerprints were searched through the criminal files
of the identification Division and no arrest record was located, ,

pervert is WF 1086-C, a former Washington gambler who continues to
participate in such activities.
