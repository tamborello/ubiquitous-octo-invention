SUBJECT: rouse SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS _ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

Congressman ROBERT EDGAR (D-Pa.)}, HSCA member,
travelled to Ottawa, Ontario, with three staff members and on
4/14/78 met with Deputy Solicitor General P.A. BISSONNETTE and
later met with RCMP officers, including the Officer in Charg
of Federal Policing Branch. Hj

The purpose of Congressman EDGAR's trip was, according
to sources, to obtain a promise of cooperation from the Canadian
Government in the HSCA investigation relating to JAMES EARL
RAY while he was in Canada. Congressman EDGAR advised
Mr. BISSONNETTE that some investigative activity would be
directed toward determining if there had been any connéction
between RAY and J.B. STONER and others of the National States
Rights Party.

Congressman EDGAR was received cordially by Mr.
BISSONNETTE but no definite commitments were made by the latter
beyond the desire of the Canadian Government to cooperate with
the U.S. Government whenever it is possible to do so.

Congressman EDGAR got off to a bad start at RCMP

Headquarters with an initial remark that one of the purposes
of HSCA investi tion was "to inquire into the adequacy of the

(prior) investigation." He was informed that the RCMP considered
the prior investigation to be adequate in every degree and
Congressman EDGAR made repeated efforts to explain away the
remark.

RCMP agreed to assist the HSCA by making available
any of its members for interview; attempting to locate persons —
previously interviewed by RCMP and determine if the person was
agreeable to interview by HSCA investigators, in the presence of
RCMP; and doing name checks on any new names surfaced in the
HSCA investigation. RCMP did not agree to allowing HSCA to review
its files, to conduct any new investigation for the HSCA or to
allow the committee to conduct any investigation in Canada.
Congressman EDGAR was told that any requests for investigation in
Canada must be presented to the RCMP through the FBI or through
diplomatic channels.
