FOR THE RECORD

By Brig. Gen, LansdaleSt_

Subject: Outline of Covert Operations

Last night, Deputy Secretary Gilpatric asked me to give him a
brief outline, by this morning, of Operation Mongoose in the light
of current US-USSR negotiations re Guba. I was to cover present
status of operations, resources, and sketch in future possibilities.
I wrote the outline, based on current reports from the Mongoose
operations team and my staff. Only two copies were typed.

I showed the outline to Mr. Gilpatric this morning as he rode
out to the airport, to catch his flight to New York.: I noted the
exceptional sensitivity of the information in the outline. He acknowl-
edged its sensitivity, said the outline was precisely what he had in
mind, and that I should hold the paper rather than his taking it. He
then asked me to show it to Secretary McNamara and to the Attorney
General. I did so, today. ;

   

The outline was read by Mr. Frank Hand, Mrs 3
and by Lt-Col Patchell. I gave its general information to General
Johnson. iGW€eVér) said that the figures were the same he had given
me, for CLA operations; he noted that CLA intelligence reporting
was spotty now, due to lack of mail deliveries from Cuba.
