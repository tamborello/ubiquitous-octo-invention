delegation in Puerto Rico, and a letter from Enrique Villareal
‘de la Concepcion, HPC representative in Chile, indicated a :
difference of opinion within the organization concerning the
MDC's views regarding the Chilean Christian Democratic Party
and Eduardo Frei Montalva, President of Chile. Villareal re-

‘veigned from the MDC.)

1, In a letter dited 29 July 1965 to the president of the Movimiento
Democrata Christiano (MDC, Christian Democratic Movement) in
Miami, the Puerto Rico delegation of the MDC set forth its :
views on what it considered a "conspiracy of silence" against --
Christian Democracy. It felt that the movement was being ;
harmed by deliberate distortion of facts, and that the cam i
paign was intensified by. Chilean President Eduardo Frei F
Montalvats trip through Europe, The delegation took exception —

, : to statements. about Cuba made by Frei, whom they considered

. ill-informed, The delegation did not feel that public state~
ments should be made on this matter, but warned that Cubans ©
should be alert concerning Frei, The delegation suggested
that Frei should be censured by the national executive com-
mittee of the MDC, : .. :

“the PDC, all said that ‘Frei has. not, ‘and .probably
. : ‘wake a policy statement on Cuba dud to the. com
plexity internal situation in Chile and because he
_would not act unilaterally in hemispheric matteérs,. They.
claim that. the statements attributed to Frei-concerning Cuba
are loose quotations from speeches, intended for internal
\ consumption which are exaggerated or quoted out of context
. _. by the press. | The letter continued, that it was not advisable
. ‘to take a public stand against the ‘statements attributed to
: Frei as that would lead-to a public debate with the PDC and
ag a result, would place other parties of the Christian
Democrat Organization of America (QDCA) in a position of
having to support one or the other, :

    

 

4, The letter said that the MDC must gather documentation on what
Frei has said and written concerning Cuba, and assigned this
‘task to the Puerto Rico delegation, This documentation could
be studied at the next national congress, and from this
documentation it might be possible to develop a good defense
for Christian Democracy and the MDC, It warned that this”
problem must be handled with self-control and without emotion,

1
5, Even though the NDC does not- like Frei's position, he is the
- girst Christian Democrat to.be elected president in,the o
. \ americas,’ he ‘has. the popular support in Chile, and/cont inues. é
to gain in stature internationally, Also, he shows respect
and sympathy toward the MDC, He is a responsible person and '
is not pro-Comnunist nor does he sympathize with the regime
of Fidel Castro Ruz. It would be a disservice to Cuba and to
N the HDC if a split were provoked between the MDC and the PDC
or with Frei, per@anally. On the contrary, the solution to
the problem is a rapprochement because the MDC has faith in
the PDC to understand the MDC's viewpoints when they are a
presented clearly’. oo

6. Ina letter dated 24 August 1965 to the president of the MDC, -
Enrique Villareal.de la Concepcion, MDC delegate in Chile,
said that he had received notice from Laureano Batista Falla,
secretary of delegations of the MDC, that he (Villareal)
would not represent ‘the MDC at the ODCA meeting in Venezuela
from 12 to 14 August because he worked in thé international
department of the PDC. He said that he had decided to resign
from the MDC and continue his work in Chile and his work for
the Latin American Confederation of Christian Sindicalists. .
