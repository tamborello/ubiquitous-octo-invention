to come to some type of an agreement as to the best course
of action to take to attempt to get this anti-crime drive
of the Attorney General's slowed down. TOURINE also
indicated that it appeared the only logical approach open
was to attempt to get to KENNEDY through an intermediary
indicating the above means would be used, ae

The informant stated that she had received a post
card from FONDA from Miami Beach, Florida, however, FONDA
would not state exactly where she was in Florida with
TOURINE. FONDA related to the informant that TOURINE appeared
to be generally concerned that law enforcement officials would
become aware of his activities and stayed in a hotel constantly,
only going out from the hotel to "this place" and returning
directly to the hotel. FONDA did not elaborate on "this
Placea’

FONDA is believed to have driven to Florida in a
1963 red Pontiac convertible bearing District of Columbia
tags and PAT CLARK is known to own a late model Ford
convertible bearing either District of Columbia or Maryland
tags. It is not known which car DELVECCHIO and CLARK used
in Florida or if possibly both cars were taken there. VN

PAT CLARK and FONDA DELVECCHIO are known to WFO
to have actively engaged in prostitution in the past and
to be well known to the hoodlum and gambling element in
Washington, D. C. DELVECCHIO was alleged to be keeping
company with GEORGE ROHANNA, CHARLES TOURINE and JOSEPH
NESLINE in the recent past in Washington, D. C. DELVECCHIO
is believed to be a respected confident of the above persons
and appears to be fully aware of most of the details of their
gambling activities.\ \ :

,

DELVECCHIO and CLARK have in the past been inter-
viewed by WFO and have been generally belligerent and un-
cooperative; DELVECCHIO particularly, exhibiting a hate
for all "cops." \ OO

 

Both DELVECCHIO and CLARK are described as white
females, about 25 years old, 5 feet 3 inches tall, 115 pounds,
and very well built.
