28 September 1976

Mr. G. de Mohrenschildt:

2737 Kings Road ©.

Apartment 142 .. -. te

_ Dear George: a : eet “

-” Please forgive the delay in my reply to your September 5th letter.
It took time to explore thoroughly the matters. you raised... 7.5; ons
- Let me say first that I know it must have been difficult for you ©
‘9 seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter. I believe f
can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic ~
. death a few years ago and the current poor state of your wife's health
> I was ‘extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances. ‘ ee ra}

. <5" In your situation, I can-well imagine how the attentions you
described in your letter affect both you and your wife. However, my.”
staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your ete
: activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years.’ The...
flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren .. |
Commission has long since subsided... I can only speculate that you~
may have become "newsworthy" again in view of the renewed interest ©. 2...
in the Kennedy assassination and, thus, may, be attracting. the atten- ;
tion of people in the media. Pk eC ate pa OR

 

 

oe I hope this letter has been of some comfort to you, George, :
although I realize I1.am unable to answer your question completely.
Thank you for your good wishes on my new job. As you can imagine, -
I'm finding it interesting and challenging. ~— — *. ants
are Very truly yours,

GeorG Bush 7

5. Mr. Helms! 3 dune 1964 memorandum For the Warren Commission on
the de Mohrenschildts is attached at C. It describes the Agency's
interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de Mohrenschildt in 1957 as a
result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year. Contact Division (now
Domestic Coliection Division = DCB) had its resident agent in Dallas,
Nr. J. Walton. Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschiidt at that time. © The
history of Mr. Moore's relationship with Mr. de Hohrenschildt from 1957 -

- to 1961 is:also attached at C. As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested ©
traces on Mr: de Mohrenschildt. The trace results (attached:at D) con-~
tained sufficient derogatory information to preclude further: extensive -
contact with the.de Mohrenschildts. (An 0S summary on tir. de Hohrenschiat
prepared in response to the current request. is also attached at Oo. ).

   

; “6. Our. files ‘show that a mail cover was: ‘placed on ‘Tetters ‘addressed
‘to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about.1964 to 7-20
1966. (This was probably not uncovered at the time of the external ine (2. oe
vestigations.) This “included opening and photographing the’ contents of.
... gome letters by the CIA Station there. The results of this operation - °
were shared with the FBI. ; . oe

 

 
 
 
 
 

_ 1 Mr. de Mohrenschildt came: to the attention of this office ‘during a
oo the Rockefeller Commission investigations. ‘We were asked to respond to a. we

_ memorandum submitted to the Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled “CIA .
Activities. and the Warren Commission Investigation." Mr. Hoch called for. ee
an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and: ~ oO aoe
_asked what Mr. Moore knew about Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de os on rs

’ Mohrenschildt about him Our reply” to the Rockefeller Commission is.

; attached at E. : ; oo . f

 

  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  

_. 8. - The niost recent. “information We... have on Mr. de. Hohrenschildt comes
from Mr.-J. Walton Moore who was: contacted in May and duly 1976 by writers -
connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press and the Dell.
Publishing Company. Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and ©

- Mr. de Mohrenschitdt. Mr. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached -
at F. ; - ce, — :

- Conclusions:

9. Mr. de Mohrenschildt appears to have lead an adventurous ‘and
‘colorful life as a petroteum engineer and businessman. He ‘ts both well

 

HW 53320. Docld:32392962° Page 5
 

 

 

 

“and poorly connected, and some of his associations in the past have
raised serious questions. Certainly his relationship witn the ;
Oswalds has caused him considerable trouble and may have caused this
Agency and the FBI to spend more time and energy on him in the past
than was necessary. ot So .

  
  
   
 
  
 
 
   

10.. Both the FBI and this Agency, however, had dropped their ~
interests in Mr. de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late —-
1960's. We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could —
either be from local. authorities in Dallas or from media representa~ ;
tives on the trail of a warmed over story concerning the ‘assassination “
of President Kennedy. We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond 2. 3: °°
-Mr. Moore's’ reports attached at F. What we can say is that we have |. .
found no indication that.either CIA or the FBI has taken any active: ..
interest in Mr.'de Mohrenschildt in recent years. . a
