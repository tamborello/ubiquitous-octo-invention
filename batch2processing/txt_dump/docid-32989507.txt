Charlotte, North Carolina
Memo Number 56

RE: SENSTUDY 75

Bureau nitel dated May 2, 1975, advised that
SENSTUDY pertains to the Bureau's handling of requests from
Senate and House Select Committees to study governmental
operations with respect to intelligence activities. In
connection with work of these committees, staff members
may seek to interview current and former FBI employees.

Recently, the Senate Select Committee (SSC)
staff has interviewed several former employees and it is
anticipated that many more such personnel will be contacted,

The FBI has pledged full cooperation with the
Committee and we wish to assist and facilitate any investigations
undertaken by the Committee with respect to the FBI, However,
we do have an obligation to insure that sensitive sources
and methods and ongoing sensitive investigations are fully
protected, Should any former employees contact the office
and have any question regarding his obligation not to
divulge information obtained by virtue of his past FBI
employment, he should be instructed to contact Legal Counsel,
FBIHQ, by collect call, Our conversations with former
employees must be in keeping with our pledge. It is believed
that such a procedure would insure proper protection and
also facilitate the work of the SSC.

The above procedure also applies to current
employees of this office, however, contact with the Legal
Counsel should be handled through the SAC,
