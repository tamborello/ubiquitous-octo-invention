MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD : Se

SUBJECT: Minutes of Special Group Meeting on Cuba, 26 February.

PRESENT: General Taylor and Mr. Bundy; Mr. Johnson; Mr. McNamara,
Mr. Gilpatric and General Lemnitzer; Mr. McCone.
General Lansdale and Mr. Harvey were also present.

The following decisions were reached:
1. The immediate tasks to be accomplished include:

a. The drafting of a paper for higher authority which
will include two assumptions. These are (1) the United States will
make maximum use of Cuban resources, but recognizes that final
success will require decisive U.S. military intervention; and
(2) the development of Cuban resources will be for the purpose of
facilitating and supporting this intervention and to provide a
preparation and a justification for it. Higher authority will not
be asked by this paper to make a policy decision at this time, but
simply to note the assumptions.

b. The plan presented by General Lansdale will be recast
to put into one paper the short-range actions for the months of
March, April and May, such as the acquisition of hard intelligence,
and other actions drawn from the asnwers to his study of 20 February
1962, which would have a low visibility and little likelihood of
giving away the basic plan. Another paper will include those actions
which would have the effect of committing the U.S. to greater or
lesser degree to intervention. To the extent possible, the actions
contemplated in functional annexes to the plan will be assigned to
specific time phases. These papers will be circulated before the
coming weekend.

The plan will contain more on intelligence, including
a reference to the effort required in third countries.

The reference to a Presidential memorandum, in the
first two lines of the Lansdale paper of 20 February, will be deleted.

The paper should. include reference to the development
“ of adequate Cuban leadership.

c. The Special Group will consider these papers, with the
Attorney General present, before presentation to higher authority.
