RE; ISADORE IRVING DAVIDSON.
. .  NEGKESL -
Washington, D. C,; and Banyan Cafeterias, Int., a Florida corporation,
Our investigations have not disclosed any evidence of payoffs or
kickbacks being made to Hoffa or other Teamsters or Pension Fund

officials in connection with these loans and Davidson has denied any
such kickbacks or payoffs,

A current investigation under the White Slave Traffic Act
(WSTA) involving prostitution in Washington, D. C., indicated that
Davidson upon ‘interview admitted he had used prostitutes made avail-
able to him by a steward in the Variety Club in the Willard Hotel.
‘Davidson also arranged for a prostitute to fill a date with Leonard
Bursten, a former Assistant United States Attorney in Milwaukee now
i practicing law in Miami, Florida, Bursten is a friend ‘of Davidson's
and has also been involved in several transactions relating to loans ‘
from the Teamsters Pension Fund. In connection with this investi-
gation, Departmental attorneys have expressed a keen interest in our
investigation and.all copies of ‘reports have been furnished to the
Department, It is anticipated that the facts concerning the WSTA
investigation willbe presented to a Federal Grand Jury in Washington,
D.C., during December, 1961. It is likely that Davidson. and Bursten
will be called to testify. _ .

In October, 1961, a confidential infornian vised that
Davidson was’ in contact wi alr. Shapek (phonetic )pparently
connected with or visiting{the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.Cg](S)

Davidson advised Shapek [tha the Israelis received a. "bum deal" in &®

regard to the .plafie mat mance deal in France and did not know

L whether it was desirable to go further regarding this matter, but

: felt that it was best to carry it no further as it might“ embarrass

‘the Kennedy Administration. Davidson said that he had “in mind some

plan whereby he_-could get the material together regarding’ this matter

and-furnish it [to Shapek}@hrough "Jack" possibly Jack Andersoa, |

syndicated columnist. asSociated with Drew Pearson). Davidson
indicated "Jack" would take him to see the Attorney General and perhaps

a discussion .of. the matter would result in some business for the —

Israelis. Davidson indicated in this conversation that he was going

to go with James Hoffa on 10-31-61 to San Francisco; This information

was furnished the Attorney General on 10-30-61, (63-5-7720; 31-88542;
