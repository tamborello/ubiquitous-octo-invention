NY 92-851
ADMINISTRATIVE CONTINUED:

LOUIS SANGARI, Newark, NJ, is also involved and in
fact for the past ten days U.S. Customs has maintained a
surveillance on him. During this period he was not observed ‘
meeting the subject at any time.

U.S. Customs will keep the NYO advised of develop-
ments. In addition the NYO is supplying background infor-
mation and photographs to U.S. Customs in order to facilitate
their investigation. SA WALSH also confidentially advised
that there is a good possibility that a U.S. Customs Examiner
could be involved in the case since there is little likelihood -
such large shipments could enter the port without inside
help.
