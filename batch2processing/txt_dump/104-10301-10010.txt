5. fhe Mexico Oity Station approaches the classic station
in opportunities and in operations. It has high-level
operations, unilateral operations, joint operations with the host
government, end Soviet, Satellite, Cuban, and indigenous Communist
Party operations. Tt fes local colieborative liaison with other |
U.5. agencies: the State Department, the Federal Bureau of Investi«
getion, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the military.
fo accomplish this wide range of tasks, the station is. sed
into the Soviet Branch, Cuban Branch, Satellite Branch,
Action Branch, Communist Party Brench, and an operational catch-all
which is called the “Operational Support Branch." This latter
branch is headed by @ senior operations officer who has tvo assist~
ents, but the branch in reality is ean extension of the chief of
station's personal clandestine capabilities, giving force and .
effect to that facet of the chief of station's personality as an
operator. The deputy chief of station, in addition to his admine
istrative duties, also personally handles the operations of three
projecta. ;

with the Western Hemisphere. It is the major transit point for

week travel each way to and from Havana via Mexico City. Thies

fact plays a prime role : the station's operational ectivi-
ties. For example, over cent of the station's FI reporting

on Cuban activities in year dealt with travel, both Guban .
