TURNER has a two per cent interest in the Hotel, and is not an
owner of record. In addition to his regular salary, he receives . mo,
a return on his two per cent undisclosed interest, TURNER is one te

did he think he. was to. fire a man like TURNER. He was then | ~ :
instructed to go to TURNER, get down on his knees and apologize, :
and to have TURNER on the payroll by evening. The informant said

COHEN did as instructed and was greatly upset over the fact that" —

he might have put himself and his career in dire jeopardy over the
incident. — ; :
