Pittsburgh individuals other than FRANK AMATO, GABRIEL
MANNARINO or SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA were known to be members

The source of DAVE WALLACE, Allegheny County Police
Officer, Pittsburgh, Pa., who was mentioned in the details
of this report, has been identified as Mrs. WILLIAM CONSTANZO,
Marshall Avenue, Fox Chapel, Pa., who allegedly is closely
associated with GABRIEL MANNARINO.

.. PG 668-PC is presently incarcerated and has been
deleted from the Top Echelon Criminal Informant Program,
therefore, was not interviewed.

PG 674-PC was interviewed on 2/7/63 and readily
