2. There were five telephone calls to or from the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City which (after 22 November 1963) were linked to
OSWALD for the period 27 September 1963 to 1 October 1963:

a) Shortly after 1600 hours on 27 September 1963 the Soviet
Embassy, Mexico City, received a call from Sylvia DURAN, a Mexican
employee in the Cuban Consulate, Mexico City. DURAN had a North-
american in her office and wanted to know who he talked with at
the Soviet Embassy. She had sent him there for a Soviet visa
after which the Cubans would issue one to him. DURAN was told to
leave a number for someone to return the call. She gave the
Soviets the number of the Cuban Consulate. 3/

One concludes from this conversation that this Northamerican,
‘later identified by DURAN as OSWALD, went first to the Cuban
Embassy on 27 September, then to the Soviet Embassy, and
returned to ‘the Cuban Embassy when DURAN made the first call.)

b) At 1626 hours on 27 September a Soviet male in the Soviet
Embassy, Mexico City, returned the call to DURAN at the Cuban
Embassy and asked if the Northamerican had been there and was told
that he was still there (at the Cuban Embassy). The Soviet told
DURAN that the Northamerican had shown them letters.with their
Consulate in Washington requesting a visa for himself and his

wife but the process takes 4 to 5 months and they (the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico) have no authorization to issue a visa to him
and furthermore they (the Soviet Embassy.in Mexico) do not know
anything about him and cannot give him a letter of recommendation
to go to Cuba (enroute to the USSR). DURAN says that in that case
he cannot be issued a visa to Cuba either (until he receives ;
permission to go on to the USSR). 4/ ©

 

c) Shortly before 1200 hours on 28 September 1963 the Soviet
Embassy Consulate, Mexico City, received a call from Sylvia

DURAN who said she had there in ''their' Consulate, the Northamerican.
who had been to the Soviet Embassy. The Northamerican talks with
the Soviet in English and Russian saying he was '‘just now" at your
Embassy and they "'took his address" but he didn't know it then and
went back to the Cuban Embassy to get it. The Soviet tells him to
come back to the Soviet Embassy. The Northamerican agrees to do so
right away. 5/ :

(One concludes from this conversation that OSWALD went to the Soviet
Embassy before 1200 hours on 28 September, then to the Cuban Embassy
where the call was made, then returned to the Soviet Embassy some -
time after 1200 hours the same day.)

L m ODESSA Calls.

2, OSWALD Calls.
3. Original, Transcripts.
FINDINGS :-

1. Calls concerning travel to ODESSA. Three calls were made in
the Spanish language on 27 September 1963 concerning travel to Odessa. jg¥2
The first call was made about 1040 hours to the Soviet Military Attache ag Tpeetietang?
Office. An unidentified man outside*asks the Soviet Military Attache Saat,
what is needed to get a visa to go to Odessa. The Soviet tells him to we
call 15-60-55 and ask for the consul. The man outside asks for the
address which the Soviet provides. 1/ The second call was made about
1037 hours to the Consulate of the Soviet Embassy (15-60- 55). An unidentified

‘man asks for the consul and is told that he is not there. The unidentified

man asks what is needed to get a visa to go to Odessa and is told to call
back at 1130 hours. 2/ The third call occurred at 1235 hours. A man

named’ ALATRISTE (not™a Soviet) inside the Soviet Consulate (15-60-55) called

out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial America, probably a pension or hotel but
not tisted in the telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ©
ROMAN. ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the Soviets
will also need copies of the passenger manifest. (The conversation suggests
that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN were shipping representatives of the boat
"KALONIA"). 2/ There is nothing in either of the calls to suggest any
connection with OSWALD. There is evidence that the calls were not related
to.OSWALD: a) in OSWALDS's contacts with Cuban and Soviet officials he made
no effort to communicate in Spanish though he appeared to have difficulty

‘with both English and Russian, thus one concludes that he could not speak

Spanish. All three calls about Odessa were in fluent Spanish. b) Marina
OSWALD in her letter to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. (reproduced in
the Warren Commission Report)asked specifically to go to Lenningrad and
made no mention of Odessa.

d) At 1031 hours on 1 October 1963, a man trying to speak
Russian called the Soviet Embassy Military Attache Office

and said he was at their Embassy "last Saturday" (28 September)
and talked with the Consul. He is told to call the number for
the Consulate and to write it down. 6/

e) At 1035 hours on 1 October 1963, a man (whose voice was
described by the translator as the same person as above) called

- the Soviet Embassy Consulate. He-said this is LEE OSWALD, I was

at your place last Saturday and spoke with a Consul who said they
would send a telegram to Washington, so I want to find out if you
have anything. He did not remember the name of the Consul. The
Soviet suggested it was KOSTIKOV, then told the caller that a
telegram had gone out but nothing had been received. 7/
