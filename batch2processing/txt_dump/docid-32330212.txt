_L,. * /, From information received from persons proceeding from Hispano-
AUP ane, gcan ports, including Havana, it has been reported that a Cuban named

: May errer, an Anarchist and fighter in the International Erigade in the
Spe ‘9 Spenish-Civil War, was later in Russia and now holds. a post in the present
~P"-  Guban Government. . .

 

_ Nevertheless, he does not appear to be very closely allied to

Y Batista in that it is reported that he would like'to join the Cuban rebels
\ and in this connection, he has tried to infiltrate the religious orders
and ‘the secular clergy in order to attract them to the rebel camp, He
took ‘advantage of the letter of the ecclesiastical authorities asking
,for-a national concord to present his resignation from his government
ipost|.and to try to form a military junta, He received no support from i
either thé mil itary or political leaders. Soon he appeared with a slight
wound, and’used it as an alibi, saying that he had received it when he
tri ed. tos get into the Sierra Maestra to kill Fidel Castro... It is believ-

i [ittiece Ferrer" having come from the first surname of the Senator,]/ Bureau
files will reflect that Masferrer fought in the Spanish Civil War and
was a-member of the Partido Socialista Popular, the CP of Cuba, fora |.
time thereafter, He later allegedly broke with the CP of Cuba and holds
himself forth as being very anti-Communist at the present time, y)

j . “It is the writer's personal recollection that Masferrer became
a Batista supporter immediately following the latter's coup d'etat on
3-10-52 and that there was nothing to indicate any change of feeling
thereafter, However, Masferrer. has always had the reputation of being
opportunist and completely unscrupulous, so it is not beyond the realm
of reason that if he considered it to be to his benefit, he wovld turn
poo against Batista.

- Since [Eo1. Delgado requested to be ‘furnished with any informa-
tion which would tend to corroborate the report furnished by himp’two
extra copies of this letter are attached for forwarding by the Bureau
to the Havana Office. If it meets with Bureau approval, the Havana
Office is requested to furnish any information which may have come to
its- attention [tat would tend to prove or disprove Col. Delgado's report 1S)
