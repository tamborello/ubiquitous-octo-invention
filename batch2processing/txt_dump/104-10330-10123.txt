Re: Status of CIA Response to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for

 

Dear Banry:

I am writing t to update you on the Review Board’s understanding of ithe status of ClA’s Ss
“responses fo our formal and informal requests for additional information and records

that the ARRB Staff has requested pursuant to Section 7§)(1)(C) Gi) of the President John: ...
F. . Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 192, 4US: C.§ 2107 (Supp.-Vo
- 1994) GFK Act).

 

 

We appreciate recent CIA efforts to respond to our outstanding requests. As we have
noted in earlier letters, these requests will be incorporated into the Agency’s final -
compliance declaration. As you know, in requesting these materials, we are not
designating them “assassination records” at this time and we are not requesting that
___. CIA provide copies to the Review Board. As we have noted, all outstanding ARRB
requests for additional information, both formal and informal, were scheduled to be
__ completed by April 1, 1998. Although the April 1 deadline has passed, theReview
Board still intends to complete all necessary work on the outstanding requests as soon —
as possible. The Review Board is currently in the process of drafting its final report to
_the President and to Congress and it considers the issue of CIA requests for additional -
information and records a crucial one. At a meeting with the Review Board staffon |
July 16, 1998, the CLA made a commitment to complete all but three of the outstanding
requests, formal and informal, by August 1, 1998. Due to Review Board staff
commitments, we are willing to extend that deadline to no later than Friday August 7,
1998. ,
