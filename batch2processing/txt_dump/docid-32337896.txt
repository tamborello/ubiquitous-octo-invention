Cuba in about April, 1960, when CASTRO sought his arrest. PRYit)

He came to the United States just in time to
join the invasive forces in March, 1961, but the
attempted invasion of Cuba failed before his boat
arrived at the Bay of the Pigs, Cuba. He then returned

. to Venezuela, and stated that with or without pay, he
would help the FBI whenever and wherever possible. ACY)

“The enclosed memorandum is classified
"CONFIDENTIAL" as its contents have not been released
to anyone up to this point, and in order not to jeo-
pardize sources of continuing value.

. Former HAV-4 told his Venezuelan business
associates and friends that the FBI has no jurisdiction
in Venezuela, whereas CIA does. However,. the group
declared they have no confidence in CIA, and will not
deal with them or the United States Embassy because of
lack of confidence. (4)

The group wants to send one or two men to
Miami, for instructions on how to combat Communism
effectively. HAV-4 was told we could give no help
on this problem. He stated he had thought as much,
and if we were unable to actually instruct, one or
two top men of the organization would like to simply
know that they would be welcome in the Miami Office ©
on a ghort visit to furnish data and discuss problems
of mutual interest. Fait .

HAV-4 was told by Supervisor HOWARD R.

ALBAUGH and SA EDWIN L, SWEET that: the Bureau would We
i welcome a visit to the Miami Office of any Venezuelan

friends of former HAV-4, and would accept any informa-

tion they cared to offer; however, we could not request
that they make such a visit, or engage in any activities
on. our behalf, nor could we give. them, any advice. GO(L)

HAV-4 stated he would not be one of the | .
visitors in the event anyone does come, as he has
to be careful not to be classified as too mch of a oe |
"Yankee lover," or attempting to control or direct
the group's activities. He stated he only offered to -
act on this one occasion as a go-between for the group,
and otherwise remains outside the group. In this way,
he appears to the group as impartial, and so far, is
consulted by all sides in this group whose ideas might
conflict JRO

HAV-4 stated at. first that the enclosed
material was not for dissemination to anyone outside
the Bureau. He said, however, prior to departure from
Miami, that he would place no restrictions on the
Bureau's good judgment in deciding what, if any, portion
of this data should be disseminated, He preferred that
none of it get back to Venezuela, and stated his entree
to the group, and general prestige in Venezuela will
be seriously impaired if members of the American Embassy
in Caracas, Venezuela begin to discuss this organization
with Venezuelans, as its very existence is a closely
guarded secret at this time, (w) ;

Whether this unnamed organization ever becomes
a real factor in the political life of Venezuela and
Latin America remains to be seen, but at least it is a

remarkably unique organization, and the Bureau has, uw)
through the enclosed memorandum, a complete description —)
