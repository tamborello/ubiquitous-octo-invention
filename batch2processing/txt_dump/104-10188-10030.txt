STAPP ; i . .
COMMENTS : PI, Cl-and Central Cover Staffs concur in renewal.

PI STAFF: Value of the project is primarily as

an operational support mechanism. Last year
provided 36 disseminations. Although relatively
expensive, it appears to Le wortn the cost in
view of its ability to perform a variety of useful

functions.

CI STAFF: Considers project as being an extremely
valuable producer of CI/CE coverage, leads and
support to other Station operations. CI Staff
appreciates the security protlems a3 described and
feela that the Station has done a fine job in being
alert to and coping with these problems.
