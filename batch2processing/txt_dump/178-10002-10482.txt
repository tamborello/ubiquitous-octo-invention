(28) I have carefully questioned Mr. Halpern,
. ‘Executive Officer/TFV, cn this briefing and. he
—" qistinetly recalls advising Lausdale orally on the
morning of 28 Cctober 1£52 that the Hatahbembre
- Gperation had been re-rtn; that we had not heard
. €rom the team; hed not been able to recover the team, foe
and wust presumes the te:m to be either-lost or in 3”
hiding. oo an oO . Pa
(29) The mention o: the Hatahambre Operation, ‘2
gpg best I can recall, at. the meeting of the Special No.
Group (Augmented) came up in an aside, I believe ‘
from General Taylor, whe esked in effect, "Whatever
happened to that gsabotaj:e operation", and was acvisec
orelly thet it had been re-run; that the caching part
of the operation had been successful, but that the
gabotage team bad not been heard from the must ba
presumed lost. Unfortunetely, my operational dlary
notes on this point refiect only that the Matahnamnbre
Operation was mentioned casually at the Special Group

. Gugnented) meeting.

3, AL of the comments contained in the chronology in
reference memorandum are substantiated either by menorande,
operational notes, or operat lonal diary records.

4, As you are aware, ny nemorandum to you. dated 14 Novem-
ber 1962 was. prepared prior to the receipt of Lansdale's
mnesorzndum and wes not designed as en answer to it. Set out
pelow for your further inforaation are pertinent comments ;
concerning the specific points made in Lensdale's memorrndun,.

ap. With regard to peregraph 2 of Lansdale's
memorendum as veflectec by reference chronology,
the statement that Gperation Hongoose had had no
information on this operation since early Ccteber
was. patently false. Syeciiic reference is made to
the penuitimate paragre ph ‘in Lansdaie'’s memorandun
concerning a report ircm CIA which he used as a
basis for a memorandua dated 31 October 1982 to
Mr, Roswell Gilpatric. Talis refers to the tele-
phonic conversation on tho evening of 30 October
1962 between Lensdele und WnseBRveseehcever, Leputy .

reflected in my reference memorandum. During this

conversation there wa: no’ discussion of previous

operations except 2 brief discussion of the COBRA and
