Chicago notes with interest, information furnished by : ;
ALLEY on December 30, 1969, which is set out in the first
and second paragraphs on page two of this letter relating ;
to the Egyptian individual who ALLEY also met in Copenhagen,
Denmark, as. follows:

ALLEY advised that while in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
he had had to have a clearance for some work he was doing.
Shortly after receiving the clearance, either in 1964 or
1965, he received a letter from an Egyptian whom he -had
also met in Copenhagen, Denmark. The letter was addressed
to his parents in Pennsylvania and forwarded to him in
Santa Fe, New Mexico. ALLEY explained, while he was in

an Europe, he used his parents' Pennsylvania address. ALLEY
continued,the Egyptian, whose name he could not recall, he
believal advised in the letter that he was teaching
at the University of Texas Austin, Texas, and wanted to
renew old acqyaintances, ofine Egyptian also mentioned
(fkoaxsnaLin’ same in the Tétter.. ALLEY advised, at ‘ |
although he Knew both the Egyptian and ARBARSHALINS™he .
knew them separately and did not know they knew each other.’.
| ALLEY answered the letter and advised the,Evyptian that hé
: did not know the Egyptian and RBARSHALTSnew each other
ALLEY also advised, in his le er, that “the Egyptian was
welcome to visit him anytime he came to Santa Fe, New
Mexico. ALLEY never. received a reply nor has he ever
been visited by this Egyptian. ALLEY stated that he has
long since thrown the letter away. a

ALLEY continued he was fairly sure this
Egyptian was a chemical engineer, who had graduated from
the University of Texas and had come back to Egypt and
married an Egyptian and worked, for a time, with a paint
company in Egypt.

 

Pertinent to the investigation which will be _
requested of San Antonio-at Austin exas , Ris, the following ;
informafipn which was furnished by [fhe Danish Security ‘

File 105-77772) and “two or three other individuals”, whos

both interviews with ALLEY, he apologized for an inability ros
to recall mames and places, due to the considerable amount :
of traveling and the large number of peas tour fy he i

had met during the period of his European tour

 

Chicago recognizes that the Egyptian mentioned
by ALLEY in referenced Albuquerque letter and the Egyptian
identified at the Copenhagen restaurant meeting may not be
one and the same individual and for this reason his statement
may be completely truthful or that they may be identical
and he has, through the passage of time, forgotten this

meeting. In either event, considering that the;£pyptian
