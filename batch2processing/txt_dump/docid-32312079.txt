advised py SA CURTIS that any FBI interest in LANE was unknown
to him. ALEXANDER then commented that he had known for several
years that a photograph of LANE as the subject of a masochist
vite was in existence and that be (ALEXANDER) has acquired this \
photegraph recently from an undisclosed source in New York.

ALEXANDER continued that MARK LANE had been critical
of Pallas authorities and the FBI and had caused a lot of .
trouble for Dallas authorities. He stated that if MARK LANE
Should return to Dailas he would be confronted with this
photograph.

 

SA CURTIS viewed that photograph which depicts a man ;
aude, with hie arms taped behind him, sexually aroused, and his ‘
sex organs being tortured. \

 

A photograph of MARK LANE contained in Ballas files
was viewed by SA CURTIS who states that if the man in the
photograph exhibited by Mr. ALEXANDER is not MARK LANE, such —,

_ individual bears definite similarities to him.

.o Cepies of this communication are furnished the New York
; Office for Information as that office was formerly the office

4 1er*@rigin in the LANE case and may have some knowledge of the

| ~-@egistence of a photograph of LANE as described. above.

; The foregoing information is furnished for the informa—
| tion of the Bureau,::i New York and New Grleans and will net be
: submitted in LEM for disseminatien, UACB, as to disseminate such
. information it is felt contact with ALEXANDER would have to be
' made as he indicated he was exhibiting the photograph “eonfidentially".!
fo indicate te ALEXANDER that this bureau had an interest in MARK: {
LANE is not considered advisable, inasmuch as ALEXANDER was a
somewhat contreversial figure in connection with the investigation
concerning the leak of information to the pregs concerning OSWALD's
diary during the course ef the assassination investigation.
