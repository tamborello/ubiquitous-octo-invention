Friend Lee:
Once again I write you since the last time that we saw each other
in Miami. You took the books in Spanish to the hotel and I hardly
have any. I will tell you that the man plans to visit there soon
and you should close the business as soon as possible, as I told
you beforehand in Miami, I recommend much prudence and do not do
any madness with the silver I gave you. I trust you will not
defraud me and that our dreams will be realized. After the
business I will recommend you highly to the Chief who certainly
will be very much interested in knowing you as they need men
like you. I told him you could put out a candle at 50 meters and--.
he did not believe me, but I made him believe because I saw you
with my own eyes and the Chief was astonished. Well Lee, practice
your Spanish well for when you come to Havana as this is the land
of liberty, of beautiful women and rich Havana tobaeco, Don't
forget to do all that I told you to the letter and do not leave
anything that can be traced etc., and when you receive my letters
destroy them as always, After the business I will send you silver
and we shall see each other here in Miami at the usual place,
Always Sincerely
