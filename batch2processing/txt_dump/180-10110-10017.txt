Mr. Goldsmith. How long have you been working for the
Office of the Inspector General?

Mr. Shaw. Since August of 1976.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you have any responsibility in the
writing of the 1977 Inspector General Report pertaining to
the CIA's. handling of the investigation of the Kennedy
assassination?

Mr. Shaw. None whatever.

‘“Mr.. Goldsmith. Has anyone ever interviewed you before

pertaining to the Mexico City situation as far as it pertained

to Oswald?

Mr. Shaw. Yes. It was about that time of '76, some-
body. interviewed me in the CIA Headquarters building, and I
think it was a Senate Committee, but I aminot sure. They had
some files. ; ae

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you give your testimony under oath
at that time?

Mr. Shaw. No, not that I remember.

Mr.. Goldsmith. Did any CIA person ever interview you
concerning Lee Harvey Oswald's. activities in Mexico City and
the operations of the Mexico City station?

Mr. Shaw... I would have to qualify that. We discussed
the subject, of course, in Mexico City at the time of the
assassination, or immediately after the assassination.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would your State Department file, if

reviewed by a member of this Committee, indicate that you were

actually a CIA employee?

Mr. Shaw. I have no idea.

Mr. Goldsmith. You do not understand how the cover
arrangement would work between the Agency and the Department
of State?

Mr. Shaw.. I have never had anything to do with the

setting up of such cover. It would well be that there might

‘be some sort of an indicator or flag, or something in that

file that would indicate to a person who knew the ropes that
I was not bona fide.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would there be a personnel file on you
at the Central Intelligence Agency?

Mr. Shaw. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. As a matter of procédure, in terms of

how you get paid, do you get paid by the Department of State?

Mr. Shaw. No. I am under, at the present time, nominal:

state cover.. I actually, as. far as the Department of State

is concerned, resigned over there in 1973, I believe. At

: the present time, I am paid by the Agency.

Mr.G@Goldsmith. When you were working under cover, were

you being paid by State at that time?

Mr. Shaw. Yes, I was.
