PH 92-41

interview Philadelphia Cosa Nostra capodecina NICHOLAS PICCOLO
concerning his association with the Mattei Beer Distributor
Company of Philadelphia. PICCOLO refused to be interviewed

by Bureau agents.

The proprietor of the Friendly Tavern at 8th and
Washington Avenue, Philadelphia, ROCCO DI NUBILE, was also
interviewed by Bureau agents in connection with the above
gambling case. DI NUBILE answered the questions submitted

_by Bureau agents. The bar at 8th and Washington has historically

been a major hangout of Cosa Nostra capodecina FELIX DE TULLIO
and other Cosa Nostra members.

The federal grand jury probing the above gambling
case has subpoenaed various records and it is possible that
BRUNO feels that this grand jury will broaden its investigation
by subpoenaing other persons such as NICHOLAS PICCOLO, who
have refused to be interviewed by the FBI, “IPK Law 10(a)2

With respect to the information furnished by
PH 672-¢- 8 65, it is pointed out that Cosa Nostra
member was subpoenaed
at on for appearance before a federal
grand jury, SDNY. ;

It would appear that BRUNO's instructions are the
result of some apprehension arising as a result of the federal
grand jury now in progress in Philadelphia and the federal’
grand jury in session in the Southern District of New York.

BRUNO CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.
