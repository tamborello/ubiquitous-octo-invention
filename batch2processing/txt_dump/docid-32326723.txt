PC expressed concern that FRATIANNO would be hurt and
FRATIANNO told PC not to worry that he does not talk to
anyone.

FRATIANNO placed a telephone call to someone
apparently in Hayward, California. FRATIANNO advised other ;
party that he has the "package'' in his car. He told the other
party that he had been blasted in the Los Angeles paper and
the New York Times. FRATIANNO told the other party that someone
will make an offer in another week. FRATIANNO said that he talked
to someone in New York today and had heard about the New York
Times article. FRATIANNO told the other party that they will
pay. He reminded the other party he has the "thing" in his
car.

PC inquired with FRATIANNO about the above telephone
call and FRATIANNO told PC that the IRS wants him.

On 8/14/76, PC advised that FRATIANNO, when he
came to her apartment the previous evening, had cut out a
newspaper article from a San Francisco newspaper concerning
the murder of organized crime figure JOHN ROSELLI and FRATIANNO
was extremely upset because his name had been mentioned
in the newspaper article concerning several meetings he had
with JOHN ROSELLI in June, 1976 in the Los Angeles area.
PC advised that JIMMY told her that he had nothing to do with
the ROSELLI murder and did not know who did.

PC also advised that FRATIANNO told her that he thinks
the IRS is going to sue him. PC advised he stated no reason .
for this or did not explain any further.

San Francisco will continue monitor the activities
of JIMMY FRATIANNO and his criminal associates.
