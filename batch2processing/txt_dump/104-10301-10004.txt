Fidel CASTRO RUZ was identified in one of the
earliest reports in Agency files as "one of the young,
"student leaders' in Cuba, who manages to get himself
involved in many things that do not concern him." 1/
Beginning in 1948, the activities of Fidel Castro came
to be of increasing concern to the Central Intelligence

_ Agency and to the United States Government (USG). By
early 1960 the USG officially adopted a covert action
program designed to remove the Castro government from
control. of the island of Cuba. The policy of the USG
was to be carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency
and would culminate in the operations at the Bahia de

- Cochinos from 17-19 April 1961.

Beginning in 1948 and continuing even after the.

United States had formulated its official policy of

to anti-Castro dissidents, November's plans called for
an amphibious landing with armor and combat air support
to establish a lodgement. on Cuba soil from which a
provisional government (approved and epdteeen by CIA)
could issue its clarion calls for US, UN, or OAS inter-
vention.

Encompassed in this volume are the records of
the policy level. meetings which considered such items
as funding the operation, possible use of US personnel
in combat roles, the use of US bases for training or
for operations, types of direct action programs (e.g.,
propaganda. drops vs sabotage), and the host of other

_ problems related to Castro's overthrow. It also makes
clear that various US corporate interests played’ an
active (sometimes overactive) role in support of the
anti-Castro efforts of the Government.

This volume also examines official records in
light of the allegations of the Senate Select Commit-
tee's investigations that the assassination plans being
developed by the Mafia were a fundamental part of the

official US Government program to overthrow Fidel

Finally, the reader of this volume should gain’

--some insights to the character of various of the
principal actors -~- Agency and non-Agency ~- who were
involved most closely with the Government's anti-Castro -
policy during the period from its inception through
the close of the Eisenhower administration. Not all
of these impressions | are flattering; but the author,
who was in no way associated with the operation or

. the Directorate of Plans (now Operations) , hopes that
the presentation of the evidence has been as free from
bias as possible.

Again the author wishes to acknowledge the valu-
able contributions of the other two members of the CIA
History Staff, Mrs. Eulalie Hammond and Mrs. Sharon
Bond,’ to the completion of this volume. Without their
unfailing willingness to perform either the ‘substantive
research or the grimly mechanical tasks required in
‘preparing a volume such as this, the task could have
been interminable.

. For any errors of fact or questionable interpreta-

tions, the author alone is responsible.

Foreword

This is the third volume of the Official History
of the Bay of Pigs Operation and it focuses on the
problems of establishing a policy for the United
‘States. Government as Fidel Castro and his cohorts :
came to power in Cuba.* The policy decided on by the
us Government in March 1960 called for the’ displace-
ment of Fidel Castro, and it was by no means a uni-
lateral decision promoted by the Central Intelligence
Agency -- although it is demonstrable that the Agency
was far more perceptive. than the policy making bodies
in recognizing the threat to the Western Hemisphere
posed by Castro's communist affiliation. Because the
policy makers feared censure by the United Nations
and/or. the Organization of American States, the myth
of “plausible deniability" was the caveat that deter-
mined the CIA would be the principal implementing arm for —

the anti-Castro effort. From inception to termination,

"deniability" would be the albatross around the necks
of Agency planners; and from D-Day minus 2, (4. ro
15 April 1961) it became the strangling cord insuring
the failure of the effort at the Bay of Pigs.

This volume describes the Agency's organization
designed to accomplish the assigned task; and it

records the interaction between the Agency and other

government components (State and the military in

particular), between the Agency and the White House,
and among various CIA components as the program
evolved. The relationships were sometimes less than

harmonious. Particular attention is focused on the

xoles played by both President Eisenhower who author-

ized the anti-Castro program and Vice President Nixon

'who has been charged ‘time and again -- unjustifiably

as the record reveals ~- with being the mastermind
behind the operation.

Emphasis also is focused on the drastic change
in the concept of the operation between the spring
and fall of 1960. From April's plans for the infil-~
tration into Cuba of small teams of Agency trained
specialists in communications, sabotage, and para-

military operations to provide training and guidance
