From the foregoing, it should be noted that
KC 586-C-TE is 100 per cent correct in the fifteen LCN
member identifications when compared with the same
identifications previously made by MI 623-C-TE. This
is being pointed out for theinformation of the Bureau,
Kansas City, and auxiliary offices as an indication of
the degree of reliability of K@ 586-C-TE,

LEAD
KANSAS CITY DIVISION
At Kansas City, Missouri

At the next opportune time when contacting KC 586-
C-TE, obtain as much information as possible concerning the
following:

 

 

1. The reasons for*and persons involved in the ©
slaying of ANTHONY BIERNAT, Kenosha, Wisconsin, in January,
1963. BIERNAT's body was fouhd in an abandoned basement
on the abandoned site of the Bong Air Force Base, Kenosha
County, Wisconsin. Indications are that’ BIERNAT, an independent
jukebox operator, would not ¢geed@ to demands of the outfit
in connection with his business. Persons whom Milwaukee ©
considers knowledgeable about BIERNAT's murder or may have
-been actual: participants :in this slaying are: STEVE f
DE SALVO; FRANK STELLOH ( a:strong arm man and ex-con, who
now works for FRANK BALISTRIERI, the Milwaukee boss); :
WILLIAM "WEASER" COVELLI, who is a Kenosha jukebox operator;
DOMINIC "POPS" PRINCIPE of Keriosha, Wisconsin, and Zurich,
Illinois; "BUSTER" BALESTRERE; and JOE-GURERA, both of
Kansas City, who were working’for FRANK BALISTRIERI in Milwaukee
in January, 1963. In the event discussion of this matter
with informant might alienate him or otherwise cause undue’
concern when considered in relation to his overall value
as a TE, it is being left-to the discretion of Kansas City
as to the propriety of questioning the informant along these
lines.
