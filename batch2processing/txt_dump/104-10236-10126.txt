friend in Cuba, Appraisal of Content:

1, Cuban nationals are not permitted entry to 2 camp of about
1,000 Soviets at Ranchoria (N 22-52, W 80-08, grid reference
899/294 ANS. Series E723, sheet 41841) about four kilometers
from Sagua la Grande (N 22-48, W 80-05, grid reference 950/220
AMS Series E723, shect 418411) on the road from Sagua la
Grande to Isabela de Sagua. (N 22-56, W 79-40, grid reference
015/370 AMS Series E723, sheet 41841). Cuban nationals are
also- not permitted access to an encampment of about 800
Soviets.in the Rodrigo area (N 22-41, W 80-11, ‘grid reference
NR-830/085 AMS Series E723, sheet 418411) between Quemado
de Guines (N 22-47, W 80-15, grid reference NR-770/200
AMS Series E723, sheet 418411) and Santo Domingo ‘(grid
reference NQ-780/975), There are an additional three.

Soviet occupied camps at three locations along the road
‘from Santa Clara (N 22-24, W 79-58, AMS Series E723, sheet
4283111) to Caibarien (N 22-32, W 79-28, AMS Series E723,
sheet 43831V); each of these camps has about 800 Soviets. .

2. Cuban nationals are not permitted access to a camp of

_ about 500 Soviets about one half kilometer from the Rio
Sagua at the outskirts of the town of Sagua la Grande.

This last camp has a large quantity of heavy equipment,
which cannot be better described because of the fact that
the populace in the urea consist primarily of fisherman
and farmers, Some of the carge was of such a bulky nature
that a special truck had to preceed the loaded trailer
trucks and cut the electrical wires to allow for the passage
-of the loads, It was generally said in the area that this

cargo included MiG 15 and MiG 19 aircraft and a new type of 5
radar directed anti-aircraft artillery which would fjre 4
automatically once the radar locked onto the target. 3

Source: AMBUD-1 obtained the information fron Gerarda
QUESADA a representative on the CRC who in turn received
a letter from an ANIBAL in Cuba. Date of letter is

- 12 September,

We regret that the names of the ships are badly garbled,
the MISTURIN is: probably thé MICHURIN whereay no better
‘solution could be found for SEBONEK, It would be most
appreciated if Headquarters/Reports could manage to
expedite the procurement of the list of Soviet flag
vessels available in SR/Reports.

The information here will also supplement that previously Le

3. This military matericl entered Cuba in five Soviet flag
vessels through Isabela de Sagua during the period 17
August to 3 September; two of these were the MISTURIN

and the SEBONEK,2 It 4s estimated that there was probably

about 60,000 tons of cquipment which was unloaded from
these ships.3 er

Field Comment:

1.

3.

Similar radar directed antiaircraft artillery has also
been installed ‘at Morro Castle as well as along the
coast from Habana to Matanzas. Another source, a
member of a counter-revolutionary organization in-
Cuba has also reported that 2ew radar and associated
artillery has been installed at Morro Castele.

The MISTURIN is probably the MICHURIN. It was not
possible to provide a better name for the SEBONEK,

The original text of the information was not clear as
to whether or not "60 mil” tons were unloaded from the
two mentioned ships or from all five ships,
