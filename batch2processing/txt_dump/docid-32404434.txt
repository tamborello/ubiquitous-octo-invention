MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

VIA: Executive Director
Director, Center for the
Study of Intelligence

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: Status Report--Declassification of
Kennedy Assassination Records

1. This memorandum is for your information. It
provides an update on the Agency's efforts to declassify
records related to the assassination of President Kennedy.

2. During your testimony before HPSCI on 28 September,
you mentioned that we expected to release within the next
month 80-90 percent of the 10,000 pages of JFK documents
initially denied in full. In fact, the pace has proceeded
more slowly than expected, partly due to the complexity of
these documents, which include many lengthy forms. We have
completed about sixty percent of the review. On 12 November
we transferred approximately 1,700 pages--comprising the
remaining Oswald materials--to the National Archives. (Only
a handful of previously withheld documents in this batch
remain denied.) Our target date for completion is late
December, but additional batches will reach the Archives
before then. ;

3. Regarding the 150,000 pages of microfilm material,
which you also discussed during the hearing, we have
completed review of nearly 30 percent of these records. We
expect to complete review of the microfilm in January 1994,
but will still need to coordinate and redact before
releasing the records to the National Archives. This could
take up to six weeks. In order to speed up the declassi-
fication of the microfilm, we have added 11 contract
personnel and have obtained additional office space. Our
ability to accelerate the pace has been hampered by the poor
quality of the microfilm printouts, caused by unclear camera
focus. It has also taken considerable time to train new
employees and to acquire additional equipment.

4. We have also been requested to divert personnel to
review JFK documents containing CIA-originated information
in several substantial sets of records outside the Agency.
These include the holdings of the SSCI, the House Assassi-
nations Committee, the National Archives, and three
Presidential Libraries. This will have an impact on the
pace of our internal review.

5. We have been advised that on 17 November
Congressman Conyers' Subcommittee on Legislation and
National Security will hold an open hearing on the
processing of JFK assassination records. The National
Archives is the only Executive Branch agency to be invited
to testify. To our knowledge, CIA has not been asked to
provide anything for the hearing.

6. The President has yet to appoint the Review Board,
which will have full authority on questions of release and
withholding of JFK assassination records. The absence of a
Review Board is forcing us to use resources to review
material that the Board may well allow us to withhold. The
FBI has yet to release its records on the assassination.
CIA is the only federal agency with large JFK holdings that
complied with the original 22 August deadline and is
continuing to send additional material to the National

Archives.
