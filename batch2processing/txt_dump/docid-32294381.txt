By written report dated 2/14/62 /CI MEX-46 /(protect) (uJ

who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised

that several efforts had been made to locate NORBERTO FUENTES’ |

GARCIA at Calle San Juan de Letran 13, Room 1601, but was

advised by building personnel that FUENTES had not been seen
at his office in the last six months.

It is the opinion of [jmx-46 fthat FUENTES, if sis Gih
in Mexico, is violating Méxican immigration laws in view of

his entry on 6/2/61, which would normally mean that his six-
TE sston to remain in Mexico would have expired about
11/1/61.

FLORENCIO VIVAS has been contacted on a regular basis
and on 2/12/62 advised that he had been unable to’ obtain any “*
further information as to the present whereabouts of FUENTES +
but, inasmuch as the Mexican Immigration Service has a pending
case to locate FUENTES which is assigned to VIVAS, he will
continue to make efforts to determine the whereabouts of
FUENTES. .
