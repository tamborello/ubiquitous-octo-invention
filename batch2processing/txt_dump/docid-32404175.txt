Subject

1. The attached material represents the completion of

HRG's_FOTA review, against the above-cited FOIA case, of
Wayne Ja¢kson's history: "Allen Welsh Dulles As Director of
Central Intelligence, 27 February 1953--29 November 1961,

one of a series of DCI historical studies. This history had
beén the subject of a Historical Review Program
declassification review in 1991-1992, which was interrupted
a year ago so HRG could concentrate on the JFK Assassination
files.

2. Included in this package are: (1) fully redacted 6
copies of Volumes I, II, and III of the history,
incorporating all determinations by the Directorate and DCI
TROs in 1991-1992, ready for delivery to the requester; (2)
one copy of Volume V of the history, ‘which we recommend be
denied in full; (3) five copies of Volume IV of the history,
one for each IRO (this is the only volume which had not been
sent to the IROs for coordination in 1992), with yellow
highlighting to identify deletions recommended by HRG and
separate memos alerting each IRO to sensitive material in
his or her field of responsibility; (4) a summary package of
correspondence between the former CRB/HRS and the IROs
regarding the handling of Volumes I, II, and III, and (5) a
copy of C/HRG memo of 20 April 1993 to CSI/IMO on this FOIA
case. We have included cover sheets for Volumes I-III and
Vv, indicating the FOIA exemptions for those four volumes.

3. You will note in the correspondence from O-DCI/IRO
that Becky Rant recommends coordinating Volumes II and III -
with the NSC and Volume II with DOD.

4. We have kept an extensive case file of this case,
against the day HRG might again take up this history for HRP
review. If you need any part of it, let me know.

5. Please send a copy of your final release version
of Volume IV to HRG, my attention.
