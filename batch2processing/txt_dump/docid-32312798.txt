the Movement's headquarters in NYC. He directed that all further

activities of the Movement should be carried on clandestinely through

the leaders of the Ramals of the Movement.

In conjunction with the proposed reorganization,
NY 3042-S has been designated to screen all members to ascertain
their true loyalty.

If the proposed reorganization is handled in the above
manner, NY 3042-S will be in, an excellent position to furnish
identities of the "hard core" membership.

The NYO will remain alert to new approaches which might
pe utilized to limit the effectiveness of the Movement's reorganiza-
tion under the above captioned program,
