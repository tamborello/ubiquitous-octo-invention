left Miami on January 7, 1964, for Oriente Province, Cuba,
on a Sigma-type fishing boat, with another small, fast
boat accompanying it. About seven or eight persons went
on this mission. Photographic equipment, medicine, and a
few small arms were taken. The purpose of the mission was
to infiltrate several people into Cuba. :

As of January 27, 1964, Batista was three days
overdue in returning to Miami.

On January 27, 1964, Mr. Schachter, U. S. Customs |
Agency, advised that about five days previously, aU. S.
Coast Guard airplane spotted a Sigma-type boat near Racoon
Cay, Bahamas, which cay is about fifty miles off the north
shore of Cuba. It was believed that this Sigma-type
fishing boat was identical with the one owned by Laureano
Batista Falla. —

_The U. S. Boast Guard notified British authori-
ties who dispatched a British frigate to intercept the
Sigma-type fishing boat. It was believed that 1f the British
did not arrest and detain the occupants of the boat, the U. S.
Coast Guard would bring it and its occupants back to Miami.

- On February 3, 1964, local police, Miami, Florida,
located the Sigma-type fishing boat at Crandon Marina, ;
Miami, Florida, and noted the boat was abandoned, but contained

a note stating that the crew had gone for spare parts to
make repairs on the boat.

i On February 3, 1964, Mr. Schachter advised that

| two crew members had returned to the boat, had been de-
tained by U. S. Customs authorities who confiscated the
boat. : LV j ( ~ ke : re i

organization. The officers and Executive Committee of the

month period, at which time another congress is held.

: On November 20, 1963, MM T-1, another Government
agency which conducts intelligence investigations, advised
that the following information had been received from a :
member of a group of Cuban emigres trained in the techniques |
of information collection, which group has provided useful
reports for over two years: os

! v Pi Noveaber 2, 1963, a meeting was held by the
YMovimient6 Democrata Cristiano (MDC), during which Laureano
-“YBatista“falla made an analysis of the MDC's military poten-
tial. Batista concluded that the potential is almost nil,
because no ship could move out from the Miami River without i
encountering problems. In addition, Batista said the MDC
does not have sufficient financial resources to move to
Central America. Laureano Batista Falla is the military
leader of the MDC: ro . f' ) ee

that he continues as head of the military section of the
MDC, .

Batista said the MDC was organized as a politi-
eal party in 1959, and is still a political party, although
it does have an action group. The MDC would like to separate
itself from this action, or military group. Batista is in-
terested in forming a unity organization with the action
‘and military groups of the different anti-Castro organiza-
tions.

Batista said he had been negotiating military ac-
tion unity with the Comandos-L organization, but this unity
never materialized. The early negotiations between the two
organizations were to establish a mutual exchange of intelli-
gence and military equipment. Batista would have liked to

have seen this unity develop into a unity of all action groups,

with each individual group discontinuing its former iden-
tity. Batista said that although he disagrees with Manuel
Ray, head of the anti-Castro organization Junta Revolucion-
aria Cubana (JURE), he would work with JURE, and thinks
Ray operates a very efficient organization.

: Batista said that every six months the members and
Executive Committee of the MDC hold a conference during which
