MEMORANDUM FOR: Doug Bowma
\Legislative Officer, OCA
on _~ Legis IV——-)B(4+ OPS
FROM: John Carver
. Historical Review Group/CSI

SUBJECT: Documents requiring Congressional approval
before release with JFK Records to NARA
REF.: My memos to you of 16 July and 16 August
1. Here are five more documents--one from the Senate

and four from the House--which we have identified in our
final inspection of the files before sealing them for
delivery. We trust these will be the last, but one never
knows.

2. Could you once more show these five items to the
appropriate officials on the Hill and ask them to indicate
whether they agree to our releasing them to National
Archives, as required by the Act?

3. Thanks. We hope this winds up this phase of the
job.

5. We judge that the letter from a private citizen to
the Béttish Ambassador, which later found its way to Senator
Hayakawa's office, does not require the normal protection on

foreign policy grounds.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Doug Bowman
Legislative Officer, OCA

FROM: John Carver
Historical Review Group/CSsI

SUBJECT: Documents Discovered in CIA's JFK
Assassination Records For Which We
Need the Approval of Congress Before
Releasing Them to NARA

1. In accordance with the John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Act of 1992, the Historical Review
Group of the Central Intelligence Agency has the task of
declassifying CIA's documents sequestered during the
investigations by the House Select Committee on
Assassinations in 1976-78.

2. In the course of our processing, we have identified
nine copies of documents which originated in or are the
property of the U.S. Senate or the U.S. House of
Representatives, and which are separate from the documents
originated by the House Select Committee on Assassinations.
Our normal procedure for handling: documents under the third
agency rule is to make copies of another agency's documents
available to that agency for its own review, after which we
reintegrate those documents in our files at the point where
they were discovered and then release, sanitize, or deny as
prescribed by the third agency.

3. Documents belonging to Congress fall into a special
case, as the third agency rule cannot properly apply. We
ask, therefore, that you show.these nine documents to the
appropriate people on the Hill--in essence, coordinate them

‘with Congress on our behalf--and ask them to indicate in

some fashion, on the documents themselves or in a separate
message, their agreement (or objection) to our release of
these documents to National Archives, as required by the
Act. .

4. You will note that the letters from Senator Inouye
and from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence are the
only two of these documents whose originators remain on the
scene in today's Congress.
