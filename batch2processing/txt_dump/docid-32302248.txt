Narrative of Offense

The Brockville Trust and Savings Company is
located on the first floor, north half, of the Fulford
Building, Courthouse Avenue, Brockville, Ontario, Canada.
On either May 3, or May 4, 1958, this company was
burglarized, Entry into the building is believed to have
been gained through the front door, which is locked by a
snap lock, and the burglary tools and equipment were
brought into the bank building through the sidewalk
grating leading to the basement, Entry was then forced
into an office building directly over the bank, and a
hole was cut into the bank ceiling permitting entry into
the bank lobby behind a frosted glass enclosed office,
thus the burglars were not visible from the street, A
large hole was then cut through the vaiilt wall consisting
of about one and a half feet of brick, cement, and steel,
Acetylene torches were used to cut into the two safes
containing bonds, causing some of them to be scorched.
Thirty-four safety deposit boxes were also broken open hs
and contents taken, the exact amount not being determined.
The total amount of the burglary is unknown but believed
to be $3,500,000 of bearer bonds, $5,000,000 to $10,000,000
of registered bonds, $15,600 cash and $40,000 jewelry.

Shortly after the burglary, RENE MARTIN (not
identical to subject of this case, RENE ROBERT, also known
as RENE MARTIN) was arrested in Montreal, Canada, having .
been traced through a bankbook and a car sales contract .
found at the scene of the crime, MARTIN had a key to a
railroad station locker in Montreal, from which was
recovered practically all of the registered bonds, MARTIN
had been sentenced to twelve years in the penitentiary but ~
had co-operated only to the extent of stating that four Ps
other men were involved in the burglary, No other arrests
have been made for the burglary, and the Brockville Police
Department advised that the burglary must have taken :
approximately four to five hours and was done by professionals.

A number of -people have been arrested in the

and DOLLYE TOMLINSON, a woman friend of RABIN, flew to
New York City where RABIN cashed a $20,000 cashier's
check he had previously received from the Central National
Bank as part of the proceeds of his bond pledging. While
in New York City for two or three days, he met GEORGE
ERIC ROSDEN at the airport and gave him $3,500 worth of
Canadian Government bonds which were later determined to
be legitimate bonds issued in September, 1958.

RABIN and DOLLYE TOMLINSON then flew to Europe
on a‘combination pleasure and business trip where he
later met GEORGE ERIC ROSDEN. During the middle of
October, 1958, RABIN and ROSDEN sold $15,000 worth of
Canadian Government bonds to a banking firm, Leu and
Company, Zurich, Switzerland. These bonds were later
determined to be legitimate. They thereafter entered
into negotiations to pledge $166,000 worth of Canadian
bonds with Leu and Company. When Leu and Company insisted
on checking the serial numbers of the securities, RABIN
and ROSDEN withdrew them and stopped negotiations. They
thereafter entered into negotiations with the Fides Trust
Association, Basel, Switzerland, to pledge the bonds but
were referred to the Swiss Credit Bank at Basel. Here on
October 24, 1958, they pledged $140,500 worth of Canadian
Government bonds stolen in this burglary for a loan. The
proceeds of this loan were credited to the Central Trust
Corporation Limited, Vaduz, Liechtenstein. This company
had been previously formed by RABIN and ROSDEN specifically
for this purpose. On the same day they withdrew nearly
all of this amount.

On November 1, 1958, the Swiss Credit Bank
learned from their subsidiary company in Montreal, Canada,
that all of the above pledged bonds had been stolen in
this burglary.

GEORGE ROSDEN was contacted on November 1, 1958,
by the Swiss Credit Bank, and he thereafter contacted
RABIN to advise of the fact that the bonds were stolen.
Both RABIN and ROSDEN entered into discussions with the:
Swiss Credit Bank by phone, letter, and in person in an

effort to convince the bank that they were in good faith.
RABIN repaid $20,000 of the loan in two $10,000 installments,
one in December, 1958, and one in January, 1959.

. ; Accompanying RABIN on part of his European ,
trip was one KENT TOMLINSON, a. friend of RABIN, and
husband of DOLLYE TOMLINSON. He has been interviewed on

ndicates a he persons who formulated plans for the
disposal of stolen Canadian Government bonds, along with
RABIN, were SAM MANNARINO, New Kensington, Pennsylvania;
NORMAN ROTHMAN, Surfside, Florida; GIUSEPPE COTRONI,
Montreal, Quebec; and these people were aided by RENE ;
ROBERT, Montreal, Quebec, and GEORGE ERIC ROSDEN, Washington,
D. C. TOMLINSON did not know if ROSDEN had any guilty
knowledge in this case at the time the bonds were pledged
in Switzerland. According to TOMLINSON and corroborated .
by other investigation, RABIN made several trips to Canada
during September, 1958, and. again in November and December ,
1958, and January, 1959. On one of these trips in the .
last. week of December, 1958, RABIN and’ TOMLINSON flew to
Montreal, where they met COTRONI and ROBERT, and all three
flew to Miami, Florida, where they met with MANNARINO

and ROTHMAN at the Sea Gull Hotel. The purpose of this
meeting, according to TOMLINSON, was. given by RABIN as
the getting together of all the principals in this case to
decide finally what should be done about the bonds pledged
in Switzerland. MANNARINO, ROTHMAN, and COTRONI all
accepted responsibility and pledged their support to RABIN.

. On January 29, 1959, RABIN redeemed $9,000 worth
of bonds from those he had pledged at the Central National
Bank. He subsequently concealed these bonds in a desk
drawer where he maintained office space on South Michigan
Boulevard, Chicago. These bonds were located through the
assistance of RABIN and with his consent and are presently
being held as evidence in this case.

The following timetable of events concerning.
RABIN's activities is supported by investigation and set
