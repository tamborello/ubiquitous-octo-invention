Dear Mr. Innes:

A delicate and reliable source has reported
to us that members of the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Ottawa greeted the news of President KENNEDY's death with
jubilation.

2. The Cuban Embassy received instructions fron
the Cuban Foreign Minister Raul ROA to abide by protocol
rulings in force and to take part in mourning for President
KENNEDY only if official observations of mourning were
decreed by the Canadian Government and the Diplomatic. Corps.
Cuban representatives in Canada were also instructed to abide
by the declaration delivered by Cuban Ambassador LECHUGA at
the United Nations, in, which he announced that "Cuba had
received the news of the tragic death of President KENNEDY
with profound displeasure",

3 We are forwarding this for your information,
Please ensure protection for our source.

Yours very truly,
