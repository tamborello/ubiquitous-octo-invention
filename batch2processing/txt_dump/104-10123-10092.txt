tg ure at present reexamining the NRIVIGTSKY cuse and are
maaing again inquiries about the firm of(GAvdA Jof Austerdam men-
tioned in your a.m. letter, : ;
Pending the results of these inquiries we herewith “pass you the
following infornation additional ¢o that sent to you by our
CAS/52/589 of 11-6-'52, that you may the sooner be able to form
‘an accurate idea of the case. , ue :

In April 1951 your[ | represensative teen from the
‘British’- acarding to information received by us from them — 4
report on the statemeats the Dutch subject Henri Christiaan PIECK,
born 19-4-1895 Den Helder, made concerning his activities for the
RIS. In this report occur the names of "HANS", alias "HARRY", and
"PLDGA", alies "Theodor MALY", alias Paul HARDT, while two dra-
wigs were attached to the report, which PIECK had made of:
"EIDSTG” = Ienace 2188S, and sf "Halls". ;

In the book "This Deception" (published by DUEL, SLOAN &
PEARC. - Sew York) the authoress deus MASCING tells, that in the
first half of the thirties she was in contact with Ignace R#ISS,
SORGE, KRIVITSKY, Paul HARDT, and "PELIK", In the beginning of
the Vth Chapter (p. 68) the authoress vives a description of Ri-
chard SOrkGu, sayinsy among other things: "His cold blue cyes,-
slightly slanted and heavy browsed, had retainea their quality of
looking amused for no reason at ail”. _
$ seams a peculiar coincidence, that PIECK in describing "HANS"
says: "always appeared to be smiling", and "was slightly Asiatic .
in‘ appearance", Though in some further points the two descriptions
do not quite tally, there is a possibility that "HANS" and SORGE xr
are iuentical, and that for this reason that JSORGE was in the forme
half of 1955 apzointed correspondent for Japan by the "Algemeen
Handelsblaa" of Amsterdam, and "HANS" had reportedly been commis—
sgioned to go to Jupan (though according to PICK he had not obeyed
the instruction). No doubt Hede MASSING made much more detailed
statements to the F.B.I. on her activities for the 21S than those
laid down in her book; she must also nave given descriptions of
the persons with whom she was in contact.

PIECK gave physical descriptions of his enzlovyers in. the #18. It

is recommenduble cco examine whether the two descriptions of Paul
HAR’T taliy, and whether Hede. WiSoilid may ve able with the help

of Sl&CX's irawing of "HANS" anda the description to .wentify the
ould bé advisaple also to show to Aede NMalSin> SIRE hs
Ignace a#18S5 to be able to check whether after e 2
ls years TI.CK Has been able to draw a good likeness of bis
mec employers, and has done so with great fidelity.
