intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any
other organization, This source stated that Lee believed
that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the United States and should
support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution
without interference from other nations. Lee did not
advocate supporting the Cuban revolution per se,

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York
Times" reported that Senator Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut
had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of ;
the Castro network in the United States." It is to be noted.
that Senator Dodd was a member of the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on
the FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York
World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro
FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime
activity during its lizetime had been sponsorship of pro-
Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, and the
direction of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal
travel-to-Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of
life was attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public
opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed
FPCC financing by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and
ultimately, the bad publicity which the FPCC received from
disclosure of activities on its behalf by suspected
presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned
second source advised that ¥. T, Lee had recently remarked
that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to
organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that
there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and
that the FPCC had been dissolved.

“FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

. The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned
"What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced
the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the
FPCC intended to promuigate "the truth ‘about revolutionary
Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

“The New York Times" edition of January ll, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 196i,
Dr. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert
Taber as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and
Taber obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were
applied toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement,

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the
first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the
past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership
to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the
FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP. has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that

Vincent "Ted" Lee, FPCC National Office Director, was then
formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no

(C) CUBAN INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES - EFFORTS
TO RECRUIT CUBAN REFUGEES TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE INFORMA-
TION -- During recent months, a number of Cuban refugees residing in the
United States have received unsolicited mimeographed letters which requested
the addressee to cooperate with the Cuban Government by gathering information
of an intelligence nature which the addressee was requested to furnish to the
Cubans by means of secret-writing letter. All of the letters received by the
refugees to date have been postmarked at New York City and the sender has
utilized fictitious names although a number of the return addresses utilized
actually exist.

The above mineographed letter sets forth an accommodation
address in Cuba to be utilized by the addressee as well as detailed information
concerning the preparation and mailing of secret-writing letters to the
accommodation address.

In most cases, the recipients of these letters have recently been
in contact with Cuban authorities regarding permission to visit Cuba or other
matters requiring action by a Cuban Government agency. The FBI Laboratory
has determined that all mimeographed letters received to date were prepared
on the same mimeograph machine and investigation is being conducted in an
effort to identify the person or persons responsible for this activity.

Since it appears that efforts to recruit Cuban refugees for the
purpose of gathering intelligence information on behalf of the Cuban Government
may become widespread, the code name 'CUBREC" has been assigned and
communications regarding investigation of the above-described activity should
be sc captioned. Bureau file in this matter is 65-69402. Offices receiving
information concerning the above-described activity should promptly bring
this information to the attention of the Bureau and any pertinent material
obtained should be forwarded to the FBI Laboratory for appropriate examination.
