and asked informant to forgive him, After the meeting ROMEO
told the informant that he could go to ANTHONY MILANO in

DE AUGUSTINI told him he would see that MILANO was advised,

Regarding the Sicilian group of the "organization"
in Youngstown, CV 344-C stated he could not say if
VINCENT J, DE NIRO, bombing-murder victim, 7/17/61, was
a member of the "organization" or not, but stated that
DE NIRO's murders caused great concern amonue [ers
of the "organization". He stated that of all ot the murders
committed in the Youngstown area, this was the only murder
where members of the "organization" made active efforts to
determine the persons responsible for same. He cited inquiry
by PRATO, TRIPODI of Steubenville and RIPEPI of PG, as
DE NIRO was a big source of income for the group and was
cooperative.

    
     

CV 344-c stated that the "organization" made no
inquiry with him following the bombing-murder of CAVALLARO
.and for this reason he believes CAVALLARO was killed for
getting "out of line". He stated 1f he had been killed
without the sanction of the "organizgatinn" they would have
inquired as to vwno killed one of their members, He stated
that in his cpinion CAVALLARO had a portion of DE NIRO's.
operation ani apparently tried to "hog" the entire operation
after his ds:

   

Regarding JASPER. JOSEPH AIELLO, 3R., aka "Pats",
the informant advised he is no longer held in high respect
because he has "gotten out of line" by bad publicity and
by engaging in armed robbery and burglary. He stated that
AIELLO had formerly been well thought of and in Youngstown
was on about the same level as ANTHONY DELSANTER presently
is in Warren.

Informant stated WILLIAM NAPLES, bombing-murder
victim, 7/1/62, was killed because the "organization" learned
he was responsible for killing DE NIRO. According to the
informant, the NAPLES brothers were not part of either
the Calabrese or the Sicilian groups and did not contribute
to either group.

Regarding. the killing of MINICK MOIO, whose ;
body was found stuffed in the trunk of his car at. Canton,
Ohio, 9A/63, informant stated the "organization" made no
inquiry about his death which would mean to him that
MOIO had "gotten out of line".. MOIO had somehow obtained

employment with the NAPLES brothers and unquestionably
"set up" BILLY NAPLES for his murder. CV 344-c stated MOIO

In connection with the influence of-the Calabrese group
headed by ANTHONY MILANO of Cleveland, CV: 344-C. gave the following
as an illustration: He stated that in about 1955 he backed a
sheriff's candidate in Mansfield, hoping that if he was elected
he would be able to open a house of prostitution in Mansfield
and within the jurisdiction of the sheriff. The candidate was
elected without any support whatsoever of TONY MOLLICA. He
started his house of prostitution, which was a money making
proposition and shortly thereafter MOLLICA approached him and
told him that people in town were talking and saying that he,
MOLLICA, was responsible for the house being able to operate
and it was giving him a bad name because "members" are not
supposed to engage in prostitution, Informant told MOLLICA that
he had nothing to worry about as he was not involved, and it
then became apparent that MOLLICA was trying to get part of the
operation and profit. MOLLICA then turned to MIKE ROMEO of
Poland, Ohio, brother of PAUL ROMEO of Campbell, who was a friend
of informant's father, and ROMEO called on the informant on
behalf of MOLLICA, ROMEO told informant that he was “out of line"
and was giving MOLLICA a bad reputation in that he had moved
into MOLLICA's territory, _ ROMEO told cv 344-C to close the house
for a couple of months so that everything would "cool" down.
Informant refused and told ROMEO he was not out of line and
secured his own "fix" by backing the sheriff in the election
and the sheriff wanted nothing to do with MOLLICA and would not
allow him to operate anything... Informant stated he was mad
about this interference and then wrote a letter to his father
in Buenos Aires and later received an answer to the letter.

With the answer he was instructed to take the letter to
PINDELLI's good friend, ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland, and
according to CV 344-c, he did this, A-couple of days later
informant was called by "WHITEY" BESASE, who instructed him

to come to Akron to the home of JAMES LA FATCH for a meeting.

He was told to come there with MOLLICA, but informant refused
stating he was not going to be "dumped" en route or at the meeting.
He then called MILANO in the presence of MOLLICA and told MILANO
what they wanted of him, MILANO instructed MOLLICA that he was
instructing "the kid" (the informant) to accompany him to

Akron, and told MOLLICA that if a "hair on the head of PANDELLI"
was harmed he would see that the whole bunch was taken care of.
Informant then got on the phone and was instructed by MILANO

to go to Akron with MOLLICA and everything was going to be all

Toledo. Informant stated that LICAVOLI has GUS DIMA as the
representative at Sandusky, Ohlo, who has his source of income
there. At Canton, PAT FERRUCCIO was the representative

for LICAVOLI for years, but lost. out for some unknown reason,
FERRUCCIO is still a member, but not in very good standing.
He stated he has heard of "BONES" BATTISTA of Canton,

and from what he has heard, BATTISTA supported the right
candidate in a local election and was able to operate, but
needed a "bank roll" for his operation and sought outside
help, and therefore LEO MOCERI, ERNIE LA SALLE and

ANTHONY DELSANTER became his partners in a bookie and
numbers operation.

; At Warren, Ohio, ANTHONY DELSANTER became "boss"
of the area where MIKE FARAH, a Syrian, was murdered
(6/10/61). "Organization" put up ‘with FARAH as long as
he had influence and had politicians in his pocket, which
could be controlled. When he bacame obstriperous and
unechtrolable the "organization" "dumped" him. He also
stated that CHARLES IMBURGIA, operator of the Sunrise
Inn, E. Market $8t., Warren, Ohio, may now be affiliated
with the Sicilian group of LICAVOLI, but at one time
several years ago was a part of the PG group, headed by
RIPEPI. .

The Akron area is part of the Sicilian group
operating in Toledo, Canton, Warren and Youngstown, and
JAMES LA FATCH seems to be the representative of LICAVOLI
in that area together with his brother TONY and would be.
under the direct supervision of "WHITEY" BESASE of Toledo and
LICAVOLI in cv.

cv 344-c stated that TONY MOLLICA is an
"organization" representative at Mansfield, Ohio, and
although a Calabrese, will "hustle" with the Calabrese
and Sicilian groups. Informant does not consider him a
power, but heisa member of the "organization" and operates
the Ritz Bar in Mansfield, Ohio.

GIANNI RAZZANO was also a close friand of
PINDELLI and it was in his ¢RAZZANO}) bar, where the three
VOLPE. brothers were killed. Informant stated BRAZZANO
apparently was murdered at a later date for his suspected
part in the VOLPE murders. CV 344-c stated that BRAZZANO
has a son still residing in the PG area named JOHN BRAZZANO, .
who is.wextremely close to, young MIKE ROMEO of Campbell,
Ohio, who is the son of PAUL ROMEO, who is retired but held
in high respect by the "organization" and formerly a power
in Youngstown and Mahoning County. Informant also stated
that there is still a couple of VOLPE brothers living in the
PG area, but he does not know them personally.

CV 344-c stated that TONY RIPEPI was once an
associate of PINDELLI and is the most powerful of the "organization"
in the PG area. He stated there is no one higher in
Washington or Allegheny Counties and he also exerts
influence into W. Va. He stated that although "CHUCK"
TEEMER is the front man for the Red Dog Club, a very
elaborate gambling casino, and previously Club 30 and
the Jockey Club, large gambling spots, TEEMER is merely
tolerated for his political influence, and all of the employees
of.the club are working for TONY RIPEPI.

The informant stated that in 1927-1928 period,
when GUISSEPPI PINDELLI was in the PG area, GABRIEL and
SAMUEL MANNARINO of New Kensington, Pa., were just coming
up in the racket activities and PINDELLI would know them
and they in turn would know about him. He stated that
diring the same period, MIKE ACQUARO was a power in the
"organization" but at the present time he is allegedly
dying. He stated that although ANDREW MANGINI is a member
of the "organization" he is engaged in racket activities
in the PG area. He is actually a "nobody" as far as
power in the "organization" 1s concerned.

Informant summarized the PG area by stating
that in his opinion he is certain that RIPEPI is the
"boss" and although FRANK VALENTI attended the Apalachin
meeting, he was merely there as a representative of RIPEPI.
He stated that from the info he has gathered, the Apalachin
meeting was by no means a meeting of the real bosses of
the Mafia but was a meeting of the representatives of the
real bosses. He stated that as an example of this, JOHN
T, SCALISH of CV, was at this meeting and if he was there
he, informant, knows that he is not the "boss" of CV,
and if he attended, he was merely there as an emissary

‘ _ Of ANTHONY MILANO.

Re: New York "organization

cv 344-c stated PINDELLI spent a great deal of
his time in NY and had high connections and one connection
was a "power" one PASQUALE NAPOLI, who contolled the
longshoremen in Brooklyn for years, but died about a year
ago. He stated NAPOLI was his, the informant's, godfather.

Re: Cleveland "organization"

Cv 344-C stated PINDELLI was a close associate
of CICCIO MELANO, who now resides in Mexico. He stated that
at the time PINDELLI was told@ he could jump his $50,000 bond,
he was told by CICCIO MILANO that he could come and live with
him in Mexico and MILANO still exerts power in the "organization"
from Mexico. ;

ANTHONY MILANO, Calabrese, «isthe "boss"

in CV and is a close friend of PINDELLI. CV 344-c stated
ANTHONY MILANO's word is "law" even with the Sicilian group
in Toledo, Akron, Canton, Sandusky, Warren and Youngstown.
He stated FRANK DE AUGUSTINI owner of the Roman Gardens,
Mayfield Rd, section of CV, is second in command of CV
under MILANO and is also a close friend of PINDELLI. He
stated he does not know FRANK BRANCATO too well, but knows
he was a close friend of PINDELLI and is believed by the
informant to be next in command of the Calabrese group
under MILANO and DE AUGUSTINI.

CV 344-c stated regarding the CV area there are
two distinct groups in the "organization", He stated this
is unusual in that the Calabrese group is more highly
respected than the Sicilian group in this area. He stated
his opinion comes from the reactions to different arguments
which have arisen and would have later been settled by :
meetings. He stated the Sicilian group operates its own : {
enterprises and there is apparently a pact that they and
the Calabrese will not encroach on each others enterprises.
He stated that the Sicilians group includes JAMES
LICAVOLI, aka Jack White, OF Cleveland, "WHITEY" BESASE of
Toledo under LICAVOLI and ANGELO PERNA of Toledo under
BESASE, He stated that they have enterprises operating in

cv 344-c was contacted and he furnished considerable
background info concerning himself and his family and father,
GUISSEPPI PINDELLI, which he stated could serve to corroborate with
the info furnished. Informant stated he himself has never
peen initiated as a member of the "organization" but
stated that his father is a member and because of this

It is to be noted according to info of NY T-2 on
page 28, report of SA JAMES FLYNN, 7/1/63, "LA COSA NOSTRA",
CHARLES CAVALLARO was in PG at this period and cv 344-c
advises he would be known by GUISSEPPI:’ PINDELLI.

CV 344-c stated that following PINDELLI's deportation
to Italy, he slipped back into the United States about two
months later and lived all over the United States with
members of the "organization". He and his family later
moved to Warren, Ohio, and about 1941 or 1942 at the beginning
of World War II when it was necessary for aliens to register
PINDELLI was arrested by Warren, Ohio PD and held for
INS. Inasmuch as the U.S. was at war with Italy, it was
impossible to deport PINDELLI and he was placed on pond
of $50,000, which was put up by members of the "organization."
When the war ended and it appeared that PINDELLI's arrest was
imminent, the "organization" indicated to him thathe should
take off and skip his bond, He had apparently made satisfactory
arrangements with them, and he was not making enemies in
skipping the bond. According to the informant, PINDELLI
then left Warren and traveled with a carnival based on
the West Coast through Calif., Oregon and Washington, PINDELLI
was later arrested at informant's brother, FRANK's, home
at South Gate, Calif, arideported again to Italy. PINDELLI
later immigrated legally to Buenos Aires, where his brother

about three persons responsible for the murders and fled
to Italy to escape reprisal and was either apprehended
by authorities there or "they" (the "organization") caught
