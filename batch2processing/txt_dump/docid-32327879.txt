Re NY tels 10/6,7/70, and report of SA PAUL J.
STAPLETON, NY, 9/23/70. :

. The following is a resume of the events leading
up to and subsequent to the gangland slaying of SALVATORE
GRANELLO, noterious soldier in the GENOVESE "family" of "LCN",
whose body was found 10/6/70.

; NY 4336-CTE furnished information to the effect
that he was certain GRANELLO was slated to be "hit" because he
was "bad mouthing" TOMMY EBOLI and was making claims that he
intended to find out who was responsible for the assassination
of his son MICHAEL GRANELLO. MICHAEL was killed in gangland aod
fashion in NYC in December, 1968, when SALVATORE was eonfined to"
the FCI, Danbury, Conn. The contract on MICHAEL was let out after
he. had a number of disputes with LCN members on the Lower East
Side of NYC. MICHAEL GRANELLO was active with a younger hoodlum
group and had gained a-reputation of being "a very money hungry
guy". Sources reported he was Tit" for a combination of reasons
and his utter disregard for LCN authority. At the time of MICHAEL|'s
death, sources reported SALVATORE was greatly upset and angered
over the killing and vowed that he would take retributive action
if he determined the identity of the slayers.

   
    
   
    
  
   
    
   

After SALVATORE GRANELLO's release from prison,
sources continued to report that -he never forgave EBOLI for
authorizing the "hit" on his son. SALVATORE GRANELLO was then
opened as a PC of the NYO to explore the possibility of his
potential as a C-TE. On 9/23/70, GRANELLO was contacted by
Buagents for the purpose of informing him of the alleged "contract".
He initially declined to talk to"the contacting agents and re-
quested permission to consult his attorney ROY COHN. After

telephoning COHN, GRANELLO told agents that his attorney instructed
him not to answer any questions pertaining to substantive matters
that were presently before the Federal Court in the SDNY, but to act
4n a cordial manner. Bureau should note that GRANELLO was under
indictment in three separate cases in the SDNY alleging violations
of the WPPDA Statutes.

. GRANELLO was then informed of the proposed contract
and the underworld rumors that he was slated to be "hit" because
of his bad remarks about TOMMY EBOLI. GRANELLO discounted these
reports, claimed that he always got along with EBOLI and. there was
no basis to the FBI's contention about the proposed hit.

Investigation revealed that on the evening of
9/24/70, GRANELLO was in Vincent's Clam Bar, Hester & Mott Streets,
NYC, with HYMAN GEORGE LEVINE, JIMMY "JUMPS" CORALLO, MIKE. LORIA (ph)
and possibly some relative of GRANELLO's. SALVATORE left the Bar
about. 7:00 p.m. and was to later meet LEVINE ata CORALLO ‘at the Park~
Sheraton Hotel, NYC, about 11:00 p.m. He never made the meeting.

On 9/25/70, GRANELLO was scheduled to appear in
USDC, SDNY, with his attorney ROY COHN relative to an application
that he was making to the court for permission to travel to Florida. .
GRANELLO never appeared but his presence was not needed as his JO
attorney filed the necessary: papers.

On 9/30/70, NY 4336-CTE advised that GRANELLO was
missing and that he was almost certain that he was hit.

On 10/1/70, NY 7446 PC informed that he learned
GRANELLO was last seen 9/24/70, that he failed to appear in court
9/25/70, and failed to meet other appointments scheduled for 9/25/70.
Source reported GRANELLO's mother in Greenwood Lake, NY, was very.
upset over her son's disappearance and that GRANELLO's wife and
HYMAN GEORGE LEVINE came up from Miami to make inquiries about the
subject. Source reported it was felt GRANELLO was possibly hit but
that relatives and close friends of GRANELLO were not discussing his
disappearance with any outsiders.

, Subject's mother was contacted by a Buagent 10/2/70,
at Greenwoml Lake, NY. She admitted not having seen her son ina
couple of days but was not concerned because she assumed he was away

on business.

NY. 4336-CTE subsequently advised GRANELLO

with approval of VINCENZO GENEROSO, aka "The Old Man". Murder
allegedly took place in a coffee shop on Elizabeth St., between
Houston and Prince Streets, NYC. Investigation revealed this coffee i
shop could possibly be the Eighth Ward Pleasure Club located at
. 262~264 Elizabeth St., NYC, a known hoodlum hangout operated by
JOE"BEFTY" LOIACANO.

ROY COHN, Attorney, 39 East: 68th St., NYC, inter-
viewed late afternoon of 10/12/70. This was the first available date
for interview in view of recent Jewish holiday. COHN contacted
after he tidicated he désired to be interviewed by FBI concerning
his client SALVATORE GRANELLO's death. COHN furnished the following
information:

when he was contated by HYMAN GEORGE LEVINE and asked to represent
GRANELLO in a Bond Default case in the SDNY. After the Bond Default

he became friendly with GRANELLO and made a number of court
appearances for him when he made application inthe SDNY for permission
for GRANELLO to travel to Florida and Puerto Rico in connection with
his new employment at Swing A-Knit Corp., 1440 Broadway, NYC. COHN ;
appeared in USDC, SDNY, 9/25/70, to renew an application to the
court for extended travel on the part of GRANELLO. Although

ments to be there with COHN. GRANELLO never appeared.
