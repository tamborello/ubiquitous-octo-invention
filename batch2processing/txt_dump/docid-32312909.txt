Attached hereto is information pertaining to the member-
ship of cp tioned individual in the Minutemen organization, This inform
ation reflects that the last known address of subject was within the
los Angeles field division. :

; - 0n8&/19/68, IA .730-S made available a portion of the
MM membership. files which were formerly in the possession of TROY HOUGHTON,
San Diego, California, the former West Coast Regional Coordinator of the
EM, who mysteriously disappeared in Mey, 1967. . Due to HOUGHTON's
disappearances the files reflect no activity after February, 1967.
' HOUGHTON's wu # is 930 and much of the correspondance is either to or
from this numbere ‘ ° ; 7

The files, which were available to this office only
briefly, have since been returned to their original location, The
attached information is not necessarily all the information cons erning
subject's activity but rather that vhich showed subject's background
and last known address. Source has advised that the files contain
the names of many inactive members and Grop~outs but due to the poor
condition of the files, unless othemrise noted, it was impossible to
tell if subject had become inactive or if the lack of recorded activity

    

“was due to HOUGHTON's disappearances

In those instances where there is a notation "Transferred
from Norborne" this indicates that the subject either changed his residence
from some other regional area to the Western area,or submitted his original
application to the Mi headquarters in Norborne, M ssourl.
