Title: JFK TASK FORCE (JFKTF)

' Synopsis: Request facsimile machine for use on the JFKTF.

Details: The JFKTF is requesting the possession of a facsimile
machine for use by the JFKTF.

. The nature of the JFKTF's work requires hourly facsimile
contact with the Butte Information Technology Center (BITC), as
well as daily contact with other FBI Field Offices. The use of a
facsimile machine is for both incoming and outgoing faxes, the
latter of which can be quite sizable, -thus monopololizing

later Ue HOT pg aay

The JFKTIF currently uses the facsimile machine in the
Information Resources Management Division front office, Room 5849,
which at one time was an office shared by the JFKTF. The JFKTF no
longer shares this office space and is actually located on a
different floor.
