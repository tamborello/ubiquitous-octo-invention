; FRANK is going to attend an Asian-African conference
in Algiers and also she may possibly be going there to
met TANG MING-CHOU who is reportedly head of political
intelligence in English speaking countries for the Chinese

ne
TANG'S whereabouts during this period through C fe}
‘Chicago's information, TANG wrote to SUE FRANK in 1963
and asked her to recommend people to come to China. H
said she knew the procedure, the working conditions, and the
kind of people they want. All SUE had to do was prepare

a letter of recommendation and the Chinese would take care
of the rest including expenses. It could be that this is
the reason CHARLES LOMAN (see below) is in.contact with

People's Republic. €The NYO is attempting to “CURE

. FRANK.

The NY file on SUE FRANK does not contain any
inform. on showing she visited Chicago during the time
CG [590 thinks he met her in Chicago. A review of

appropriate Chicago files, however, mayshow she was. there.
Five photographs of SUE FRANK are enclosed for Chicago.

After the photographs have been exhibited to c¢/590a-s,G]
and they are no longer useful to Chicago, they “bhotld be

returned to NY. These photographs, generally speaking, are
_ @ good’ likeness of PRANK. OX] : .

Also of interest to Chicago is the fact that
-CSNY 3 advised on 5/13/65, that SUE FRANK received a money - -
order through Western Union on that date in the amount of.
- $200.00 from CHARLES LOMAN of Chicago, |

On 6/16/65, according to NY 404'7-S*, LOMAN called
SUE FRANK "from a long ways away" and said he.may see her
on the July 4th weekend. She said she would be gone then.
He also said he is sending 50 (dollars). LOMAN continued
by saying there is so much to talk about and of course the
phone is no good and the mail is bad too, LOMAN said there
are a couple of people he could have talked to her about, he..
just did not want to write about them. LOMAN wished her a
good trip, said he would see her in the Summer one way or.
another, . : : : a
