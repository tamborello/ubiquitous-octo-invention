T-22,; MANNARINO then stated in all seriousness that T-22 should
give serious thought to smuggling cocaine into the U.S. from
Greece or uncut diamonds from Rotterdam; Holland. TT-22 went

on to say that MANNARINO told him that he should be able to make
‘such arrangements with the cousin of T-25,; who at that time

uncut, diamonds or cocaine T-22 could supply.

'T-22 said that naturally he did-not make any such
arrangements with the cousin of T-25 not only from the :
standpoint of the serious penalties connected with narcotics
smuggling but also because he knew the cousin of T-25,; an
honest -young .man who would never go for such a proposition.
