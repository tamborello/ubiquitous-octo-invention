was put in charge of the task force on Track II.

Senator Schweiker. Has he really resigned?

Mr. Schwarz. He is doing that. I don't know.

A man called Wimpert who was in the Army and became in
effect one of the AGency's principal agents in Chile -~ they
referred to him as Co-op 2.

Karamessines, who was either the head or the Deputy
Director for Plans or very high up in the operation section,
and who really was the principal Washington action officer on
it.

And then Mr. Kissinger, running in a schedule that would
get that whole group done by the fifth, and we can have Mr.
Kissinger in on the fifth.

Haig, a possibility, not as,clear. And Haig and
General Bennett from DIA, and the head of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, people who may be involved, and in the case of
General Bennett and the case of the head of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, they think we ought to depose..them, and we may
get a small piece of information.

In the case of Cuba there is one Agency person that I
think we need for short testimony on the Cubella or AMLASH pe

period. He is a man named WW f| a Spanish-speaking

 

agent, a mani who met with AMLASH in Paris at the end of
October and on November 22, 1963.

We have Mr. Maheu down for Tuesday morning.
