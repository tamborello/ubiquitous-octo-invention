On 4/21/64 Joaquin Godoy, a member of the Executive Committee
in the US of the MRP (105-92704), commented on recent public statements
by JURE, headed by Manolo Ray, thai\URE would be inside Cuba during the
month of May, 1964. Godoy indicated that the MRP and its unity
organizations, SNFE and Alpha 66, all anti-Castro organizations, were,
not united with JURE but were cooperating with JURE to a limited degree.

He explained that he and his associates felt that Manolo Ray was political-

ly smarter than they and would therefore eventually dominate the MRP,

'SNFE and Alpha 66, should any close cooperation be agreed upon.

this reference concerned probable internal changes during

“nid May, 1964 in the section of the Cuban Intelligence Service (CTS)

responsible for covert operations in the US. These changes were
allegedly being brought about by a growing awareness on the part of
the Cuban Government of measures taken and threatened by anti-Castro
forces in Cuba and abroad such as Manuel Ray's plan to return to Cuba

by 5/20/64. (Details set out) BCU

It was noted that such changes would have a detrimental |

Layreano Batista Falla, Military Chief of Moyimiento
Democrata. Cristiano in Miami, claimed that in May, 1964, the under-
ground in Cuba. planned to start military and guerrilla warfare activity
against the Government of Cuba. Manuel Ray planned to be in Cuba by
5/20/64. Ray tried to give the impression that he would be in Cuba for
the purpose of leading the revolution against the government. Batista
claimed that Ray was going to Cuba because he had either been ordered
to do so by the US Government or by leading figures in the Cuban under-
ground. Batista stated that the real chiefs of the anti-Fidel Castro
movenent were in Cuba and would make all the decisions concerning the
proposed Nay, 1964 uprising. Participation in this uprising by Ray
was incidental to the uprising and Ray would not be one of the leaders.

Olga entered the US at Miami on 1/12/64 and had 5-f61d missions

activities and militant plans of anti-Castro organizations - SNFE under
the leadership of Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo and organizations led by Manolo
Ray and ex-Cuban President Carlos Prio Soccaras. (RU)

In connection with this mission CIA noted that Olga was a
personal friend of Manolo Ray; her husband was a friend of Gutierrez,
and “both she and her husband were acquainted with Prio. CIA stated :
that they had no operational interest in any organization or individuals . ,

CIA would further evaluate Olga's double agent potential '

a Cuban exile organization, recently stated that he had. found it
impossible to adapt to the internal conditions existing in JURE with
which his organization had made a recent pact. Quiza stated that a
hit-and-run raid planned for late March had been coordinated by JURE
with the alliance formed by SFNE, MRP and Alpha-66. ‘The objective
was to increase the financial support for the plan to carry the war
to Cuba ina combine; /operation; however, the agreements were

was taking place. There was still a lack of decision on important
issues such as a hit-and-run raid, distribution of funds and carrying

The "Miami Herald,” issue of 1/19/64, carried an article in
which the Ejercito Libertador de Cuba (Liberation Army of Cuba - ELC)
(105-110055) announced its union with JURE headed by Manolo Ray.

On 1/22/64 Dunney Pio Perez Alamo, who had been Chief of

Military Operations for ELC, advised that the ELC at one time was part
of the same group which currently comprised JURE. He stated that
Manuel Ray had been leader of the MRP at the time of the Cuban invasion
in April, 1961, and that the MRP was the forerunner of JURE, of which
Ray was the regarded leader although he was only one of. the members of

the Executive Board of JURE. He continued that after the defeat of

Cuban forces in the April, 1961 invasion, Ray resigned from the MRP

and organized JURE at a meeting of former MRP members in Puerto Rico.
i At the time Ray resigned, the ELC was formed from a segment of the former
MRP. Perez further related that he and other members disputed the
description of Ray "Fidelismo without Fidel" (desiring the same type of
government as Castro). He regarded Ray as a firm believer in democratic
principles and stated that Ray was one of the first in Cuba to work in
opposition to the Castro regime once he saw that Castro was taking Cuba
in the direction of communism. Perez stated that Ray renounced his
position as Minister of Public Works under Castro in 1959 and at that time
began to work clandestinely in Cuba to organize his MRP before he toak
exile in the US around latter 1960.
