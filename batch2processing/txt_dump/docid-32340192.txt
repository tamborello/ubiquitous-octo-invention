their action, Minsk advised that they had not directed the
matter but that MARINA OSWALD's uncle, who was a lieutenaat
colonel in the local militia, had voluntarily approached
OSWALD and requested that he not be too critical of the

| Soviet Union upon his return to the U.S, Source commented
that when Minsk was originally requested to furnish a summary
of OSWALD's file, they were not aware of the international
events that took place, therefore, in an attempt to ingratiate
themselves with the KGB center in Moscow, had included the
statement concerning their endeavors to influence OSWALD in
the right direction, 4M

Source stated that the KGB was upset over the OSWALD

affair and had a staff of employees called in to work. The

file was reviewed in detail to make sure that the KGB did not

utilize OSWALD as an agent, u sO

 

source advised that the wife of OSWALD was not in the employ

of KGB aS an agent. He stated she was regarded as not a
particularly intelligent person, but stated she had been a
member of the Komsomol but was dropped for nonpayment of dues *
over a long period, Source advised that she was permitted to «4
leave Russia with her husband but this was not significant
since there was no objection from KGB and that under the law’
since the death of. STALIN, it is possible for a Russian wife

to depart the Soviet Union with her foreign husband, Source
again stated that OSWALD had never worked for KGB. “UA
