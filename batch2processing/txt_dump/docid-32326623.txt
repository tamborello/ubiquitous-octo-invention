Eleven copies of this report are being desig-
nated for the Bureau inasmuch as it is felt the Bureau
may desire to designate copies of this report to various
Intelligence Agencies.

Copies of this report are being designated
for New York for information purposes in view of the
relationship between OCHOA and CARLOS PRIO.

once or twice a week on an average.
