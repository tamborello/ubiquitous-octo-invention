pro-Communist, CTAL, which is described as being the liaison '
bureau of the WFTU (World Federation of Trade Unions) whose i
headquarters are in Prague, was headed by Vicente LOMBARDO
Toledano.

18. Prensa Latina

Operatidng directly under the Cuban Communist regime,
Prensa Latina is obstensibly a press service. In reality,
however, it is the official propaganda organ of the Cuban
Government. Prensa Latina works closely with Tass, the
Soviet Agency; with Hsinhua, the Chinese Agency ;and with
Cetepka, the Czechoslovakian Agency.

9. Direccion Federal de Seguridad —- Federal Security Police

 

The principal functions of this security unit are to:
(1) Provide a plain-clothed security detail for the President,
(2) maintain an extensive telephone tap activity on both
the Rightist and Leftist political opposition forces, and
(3) perform investigations and arrests of primarily political
offenses. The unit's agents are largely poorly trained,
insecure, and unreliable. Their professional characteristics
are best described as being dishonest, cruel, and abusive.
The position, at this moment, of Manuel RANGEL Escamilla as
Director General of DFS is precarious.

10. Politica

A Marxist anti-U.S. semi-monthly magazine published in
Mexico, Politica is printed by Talleres Graficos de Mexico,
the same Shop which prints La Voz de Mexico. In addition to
the modest revenues derived From a circulation of 15,000
to 25,000, Politica is financed by the Soviet Embassy, the
MLN, the PPS, and possibly, the Cuban Embassy. As an
indication of the Mexican government's assessment of the
capability of this magazine to influence public opinion, it
is worthwhile noting that Politica frequently experiences a
great degree of difficulty in printing and circulating itself
due to the government's repressive efforts.

11. Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN)

Organized under the influence of the PCM in August 1961,
the MLN today is dedicated to the furtherance of the mutual
interests of its adherents who are found primarily in the
ranks of the PRI, the PPS, the PCM, the CNC and the UGOCM.

The MLN's objective is to gain leftist political represen-
tation in the government by inciting PRI to accept leftists
into its camp. As a consequence of this objective, the mission
of MLN is to generate evidence of popular leftist sympathy

by means of fomenting agitation among the popular, labor, and
peasant masses.
