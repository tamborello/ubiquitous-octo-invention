behalf with Hank were not successful, we do appreciate
fact that you and your wife wene out of your way to

to help us..

          
   
      
    

-*].-re ferred. the matter. of. your late moving bill to
appropriate individual. Unfortunately, cits” bilr’
received too late, as all youx accounts had been
me to extend his regrets «
