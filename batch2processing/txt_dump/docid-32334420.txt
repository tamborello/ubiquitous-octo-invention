that GRADY R. TURPIN had, during the evening of 6/22/65, advised
him that he had been interviewed by an agent of the FBI on the
same date’at his home. TURPIN was visibly shakenby the
experience and advised that he did not want anything further

to do with the captioned group and was contacting informant

as a warning that he too had better pull out. Informant

advised that if further interviews are conducted with members

of the captioned organization, he believes that their

deterrent effect will completely destroy the organization as

it presently exists.

ATTU, INTC, OSI, and Secret Service are each being
furnished two copies of LHM locally.

Enclosed LHM is classified confidential inasmuch
as unauthorized disclosure of the information could reasonably
result in the identification of a confidential source of
continuing value and compromise his future effeciveness.
