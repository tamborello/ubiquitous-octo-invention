to Pittsburgh he became angry with MESSER and his move and
-had someone drive a car over MESSER one night as he was
crossing a street. MESSER said when he was discharged
from the hospital he found out that his automobile had
numerous bullet holes in it. MESSER said that because he
thought. he would make money in the East Liberty section,
he stayed in the business of writing numbers and actually ;
forced LA ROCCA out of the numbers business. i

MESSER advised that in about 1943, he and LA ROCCA became

friendly and LA ROCCA invited him to share equally in ‘the

ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company. . my
which later set up offices at 5746 Baum Boulevard in :
Pittsburgh. MESSER recalled that LA ROCCA was. completely |
bankrupt at that time because of numbers setbacks. but r
managed to raise enough money to put up his share. MESSER ;
said he personally travelled to Chicago to arrange for the

purchase of machines to be distributed by this company and

had a verbal agreement with ART ROONEY who allowed him to :

place these machines throughout the East Liberty, Homewood

and Garfield sections of Pittsburgh where ROONEY was not

operating. According to MESSER, ROONEY, who was the present

owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, professional football club,

was the only man who could get paste reels before LA ROCCA

tried, and controlled the entire Pittsburgh vicinity in

this regard, MESSER said that the Government placed a $100

tax stamp on each machine..and the City of Pittsburgh put a

$50 tax stamp on each machine. He said that other owners of

that company, in addition to himself and LA ROCCA, were
’ FRANK AMATO, BARNEY McGINLEY, SAMUEL MANNARINO and F, W.

Z0GG, the latter from Chicago. .

On August 31, 1953, LA ROCCA, while teeti tying at an
Immigration and Naturalization Service hearing in his own
pehalf, stated he had been "mixed up" in bootlegging,
numbers racket, and slot machines, and that in his earlier !
days he had worked as an Indiana County, Pa., coal miner.
LA ROCCA stated that he was then engaged only in legitimate
‘enterprises, :

PG T~3, who requested his identity remain confidential and who-
stated he will not testify at any future Federal or state
proceedings, advised that the "top. men" in Pittsburgh rackets
met in the dining room of the Genovese Cocktail Lounge, now
called the Red Eagle Club, 412 Larimer Avenue,. Pittsburgh, where
they hold general discussions. PG T-3 was of the opinion that
JOHN LA ROCCA held the controlling interest in this club,
although it was operated by MIKE GENOVESE and his brother,

PHIL GENOVESE. PG T-3 stated that during the meetings of the
various individuals at the club, JOHN LA ROCCA was definitely
the "big man" in the group and was looked up to by all other
men in attendance. PG T-3 stated that all orders came from

LA ROCCA unless SAMUEL MANNARINO was present, in which case SAM
MANNARINO, at times took precedence over LA ROCCA since he was
considered by many as the chief racketeer in the Western
Pennsylvania area ad that JOHN LA ROCCA was immediately next to
MANNARINO. PG T-3 added that it was obvious that MIKE GENOVESE
was next in line after LA ROCCA and was often considered being
_groomed for LA ROCCA's position with all of his holdings and
responsibilities. . :

PG T-3 went on to say that the following individuals have been
and still are closely associated with JOHN LA ROCCA, They have
been active leaders in some type of illegal operations at one
time or another: .

7B. CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

 

A Criminal Intelligence Report furmished by Detective JOHN
CHRIN, Pennsylvania State Police, Greensburg, Pa., dated
October 14, 1942, set out that IGNACIO CASTAGLIA and JOHN
MICALE operated a pinball machine business under the name

of the Fayette Novelty and Vending Machine Company. The
office of this business was on. East Pittsburgh Street,
Connellsville, Pa. CHRIN advised.that this company was
controlled by LA ROCCA, In addition, according to CHRIN,

LA ROCCA had a company named the Rock-O-Law Juke Box Company
which had music boxes in most of the roadhouses throughout
Fayette County, Pa. This business was believed by CHRIN

to be controlled by MICALE, CASTAGLIA and LA ROCCA, CHRIN
stated that on August 3, 1942, at about 2:50 PM, .a shooting
took place on East Pittsburgh Street, ‘Connellsville, between
MICALE and LA ROCCA, MICALE fired a shotgun blast at |

LA ROCCA and missed. CHRIN believed that this was because
of an argument that had ensued as a result of LA ROCCA's .
making an effort to place machines in the county without the
consent of CASTAGLIA and MICALE, ;

On February 27, 1958, GEORGE MESSER advised SA ROBERT A.
VOEGE that he had been in the numbers writing activity since

about 1928 and was still active in this regard. He said that —

most of Pittsburgh's present day "big racket mien" once
depended on him solely for protection purposes since he.
knew local and state police figures and recalled that JOHN
LA ROCCA was one. of these racketeers. MESSER stated that
LA ROCCA became acquainted with him in about 1941 or 1942
when LA ROCCA was handling'all the numbers activity in

the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh and had set himself
up as a "little God." When LA ROCCA became dissatisfied
with his financial gains, he left Pittsburgh on a trip to
Chicago to see friends about paste reel machines with which
he felt he could make more money. MESSER said a paste reel

‘was similar to a "one-armed bandit" with the exception that

a small paper-wrapped mint was dispensed after the coin was.
placed in the slot. and the play was registered. The Chicago

_manufacturer of this machine eirecumvented the "strictly

for gambling purposes" phraseology in the law in this manner.

While LA ROCCA was in Chicago, MESSER said he moved into the
East Liberty section and took over the entire numbers
operation. He turned in his numbers returns to one GEORGE
CHRISTY (now deceased) in Pittsburgh. When LA ROCCA returned

who.stated he will not testify at any future Federal or state:
proceedings, advised that SEBASTIAN LA ROCCA,: the son of
IGNAZIO and ROSARIA SCANCARELLO, was born at. Villa Rosa, Italy,
on December 19, 1901, and that he departed from Villa Rosa .
prior to 1927,-the year in which the registration of the ~—
inhabitants of that community was begun,

of 2) Citizenship Status

accotding to the files. maintained by the. Pittsburgh Office
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Pittsburgh,
Pa., aS.made available to SA WILLIAM R. WALL on December 12,
1957, by HAROLD LAUVER, Supervisory Ifivestigator, LA ROCCA’

' entered the United States on September 2, 1910, at New York
City, N.Y., aboard the "Principe De Piemonte."

These same Immigration and Naturalization Service records show
that on May 12, 1950, LA ROCCA applied for United States citizen-
ship. On January 20, 1953, a deportation warrant was:issued

for LA ROCCA by the District Director, Immigration and Natural-
ization Service, Philadelphia, Pa.; said warrant was based on
Sections 241(a)(4) and 212(a)(12) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act. He was arrested January 21, 1953, and subse-
quently given a deportation hearing as an undesirable alien,
This undesirable status was based on previous arrests involving
LA ROCCA on criminali-type charges. On August 31, 1953, LA ROCCA
testified before an Immigration and Naturalization Service :
Hearing Board that he had been involved in the numbers racket,
bootlegging, and slot.machines, but added that he was no longer
involved in anything :othér, than legitimate enterprises. The
"Pittsburgh Press," 4°Pittsburgh daily newspaper, publicized
portions of LA ROCCA's. testimony on November 10, 1954, and
reported that. LA ROCCA had testified that his financial holdings
amounted to approximately one-quarter of a million dollars and
if permitted to remain’in the United States, LA ROCCA testified,
he would not become a burden of the state.

The "Pittsburgh Press" of August 6, 1959, carried an article
entitled "LaRocca Ends Battle for Citizenship." It stated
that "Pittsburgh racketeer John LaRocca has decided he
doesn't want to be an American citizen after all." It told
how his attorney, VINCENT CASEY, filed two petitions in Federal
Court at Pittsburgh on August 5, 1959. One asked the court to
stay action by the Immigration and Naturalization Service

on LA ROCCA's nine-year-old petition for citizenship and

the other asked that the application be thrown out completely.
The article said that the Government did not. want to

let the matter drop so quietly and contended that LA ROCCA

had to go through with the hearings anyway and show why he
changed his mind, _The hearing was postponed until the Judge
could rule on the legal points raised by both sides,

wanted to withdraw his application to save himself further

trouble with authorities and said LA ROCCA has been "harassed
