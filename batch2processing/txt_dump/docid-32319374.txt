Memoranda to Mr, W. ©, Sullivaa ;
BR: HOUSE COMMITTER ON UN-~AMERICAN ACTIVITIES
ELAN INVESTIGATIONS

; the Atlanta Office advised on 11-5-65
that eur informant, stated that no meeting
such as on described ever took place. SAC Ponder further
advised that at the time of President Kennedyjs death, there
were numerous allegations that Oswald had been in Atlanta
and these aliegatious were given considerable newspaper
publicity, The allegations were thoroughly and completely
investigated by the Bureau and found to be false. It is
believed Shelton was aware of the newspaper publicity con-
cerning Osvald being in Atlanta; therefore, he concocted

the above story. It is to be noted that Shelton according
to a Washington Field source believes Venable is furnishing
information to captioned Committee concerning his (Shelton's)
organization.

RECOMMENDATION:

In view of the above, no action should ‘be taken in
thie matter..

F, 3d, Rawagardner f.,

  

A Bureau souree who is very close to Robert Sheltoa, Imperial
Wizard, United Klans of Am@ica, Isc., Knights of the Ku Klux Kian, kas
i advised that Lester Chalmers, Shelton's attorney, met with Congressman
Bdwin E, Willis, Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities,
during the weekend of November 6, 1965, possibly in New Orleans, During
this meeting Chalmers explained to Willis the story concerning Lee Oswaid'®s
dnavolvenont in seme bombings in Alabama.

You will recall that this source previously advised that shortly
| vefore the assassination of former President John F, Kennedy, Shelton
i was allegedly contacted by James Venable, lender of the National Knighta
of the Ku Kiux Klan. Venable indicated thet Oswald had been active in
sone bombings in Alabama and offered the services of Oswald to Shelton,
which offer Shelton declined. Shelton, according to the source, siso
related that Oswald was in Atlanta, Georgia, when former President Kennedy
was scheduled to speak at Georgia Tech, The speech was cancelled, but
aecording to Shelton, Oswald engaged in some pickéting activity and was
photographed. The Atlanta Office has checked with one of our itaforments,
who ws allegedly in on the meeting between Shelton and Venable, and the
; informant advised that no such meeting took place. The Atlanta Office has
alse previously checked on allegations regarding Oswald'spreseme in Atlants
prior to the assassination of President Kennedy and has determined that
ali such allegations were not factual,

According to our source, Chalmers indicated that Willis was
| amazed with the above story as told to him by Chalmers but made no

i coamitment other than to say that he (Willis) would contact Chalmers
when he returned to Washington, BD. C.

Source also advised that Willis had told Chalmers that Sherits
Newt Lowe was engaged in a run-off campaign for re-election and had to
be protected if he was going to win, We previously received information
that Willis is trying to arrange for Chalmers to represent Sheriff Lowe
during Lowe's appearance before the Committee. Sheriff Lowe had been
a member of the Jonesbore, Louisiana, Unit of the United Klans of Anerics
and tis. from the Congressional District of Otte Passman, Democrat of
Lovisiana.

Memorandum Baumgardner to Sullivan
RE: SOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AWERXCAN ACTIVITIES
KLAN INVESTIGATIONS

The source further advised that Robert Scoggins, Grand Dragon
for the State of South Carolina, had been notified by the Veterans
Administration that his disability pension has been reduced. Shelton
feels that this was a retdiatory measure taken by the Committee and the
Veterans Administration against Scoggins. Therefore, the Klan is
lodging a protest with the American Legion and the Disabled American
Veterans. Shelton stated that when Raymond Anderson, the Grand Bragon
for the State of Tennessec, appears to testify before the Committee,
Shelton and members of ‘the press would accompany Anderson to the Veterans
Administration to inquire if Anderson's disability pension will also be
peduced, i. ~

It is noted that Anderson is a Bureau informant, who while
serving in the Armed Porces during the Korean Conflict lost his left
ara. This loss entitled him to a disability pension.

Qbservations:

Chairman Willis is being contacted by Assistant Director
DeLoach concerning the information furnished to him by Chalmers regarding
Oswald and to advise Willis that the information is not factual. It
appears that Shelton is circulating the story in order to possibly
discredit Venable, who: he feels has furnished information to the
Committee concerning Shelton and Shelton's Elan organization. Although
Venable did testify in executive session, a review of the testimony
indicates that he furnished little or no information of value, and
Shelton*s assumption is erroncous.

The information regarding Shelton's proposed visit to the
Veterans Administration is known only te a limited number of individuals
including the source and Anderson, who is also a Bureau informant. In
the event ye advise the Veterans Administration of this matter, it could
possibly result in the loss of two valuable sources since the Veterans
Administration may reveal that thoy had advance knowledge of this visit.
it is not believed that any real harm will be caused by this action on
the part of Shelton and, therefore, it is felt that the Veterans
Administration should not be advised.

; We have previously advised the White House and the Attorney
‘». General regarding Willis’ actions with regard to Sheriff Lowe.

RACIAL MATTERS (KLAN)

A source of the Bureau who 41s serving as Public
Relations Director for Robert YU. Shelton, Imperial Wizard,
United Kians of America, Inc., Knights of the Ku Klux Kian,
has furnished information obtained by him during Bis contacts
with Shelton. .

According to Shelton, about two weeks before the
assassination of former President John F, Kennedy, he was
in contact with James Venable, a leader of another Klan
organization. Venable told Shelton that he was in contact
with Lee Oswald and that Oswald had been active in sone
bombings in Alabama, Venable offered the services of Oswald
to Shelton and stated he could be used by both groups.
Shelton stated he declined Venable's offer and that this
declination was made in the presence of Calvin Craig (Grand
Dragon of Shelton*s organization) and Bob Thompson (Vice
President of Shelton's organization and a racial informant).
Shelton also stated that according to Venable, Oswald was in
Atianta, Georgia, at a time when former President John F,
Kennedy was scheduled to speak before a Georgia Tech group.
This speaking engagement was canceled and he did not appear
in Atlanta; however, there was some picketing activity in

Hurt (phonetic) Park, Atlanta, and the source got the impression

the Atlanta newspapers at this time contained information or

a photograph that will prove Oswald was in Atlante at that tine.

Shelton further clains that he saw a registration card for
gessia while he was staying in one of the Marriott Motels in
tianta,

Shelton told his Attorney, Lester Chalmers, to get in

touch with Congressman Edwin D, Willis, Chairman of the above-

captioned Committee, According to our source, Chalmers con-

tacted Congressman Willis and arranged to meet him in New Orleans

on the evening of 11-5-65. Chalmers intends to present
Shelton's story to Willis but not to make any recommendations,
to Willis as to what he should do. '#f Willis wants to talk
personally with Shelton, he will make him available at the
time and place set by Willis, ,
