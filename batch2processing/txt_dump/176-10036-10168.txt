PLANS TO GEN STILWELL. THE VIETNAMESE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MEMBERS

OF THE U.S. MILITARY WHO LEAK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM. I DO NOT |

” SUSPICION EXISTS AND THERE IS NO USE IN PRETENDING THAT. IT DOES NOT.

"FONDLY POLITICAL AS A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT. IN Fact, I WOULD SAY

“TO DO THIS WOULD PROBABLY. BE THE END OF ANY HOPE FOR A ‘CHANGE OF

(GOVERNMENT HERE. THIS’ 1 SAID. INPERSONALLY AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION,

SINCE GEN HARKINS IS A SPLENDID GENERAL AND AN OLD FRINED OF NINE TO
