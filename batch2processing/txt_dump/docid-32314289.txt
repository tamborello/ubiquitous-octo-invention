that she is’ aware of this, t

Later GRANN related that GEORGE (SALVATORE
BONITO, aka George Raft) mentioned that he was going
to take the car which had been impounded by the Federal
Government. It appeared she was referring to the auto-
mobile owned by THOMAS CALLEA, which had been impounded
after a recent bookmaking arrest. She stated she told
BONITO that he would be shot if he tried and that since
he was in his attorney's office at the time he should
ask for legal advice. She stated that BONITO was
accompanied by DANNY (SANSANESE) at the time and that
he was told he was crazy if he tried. From this it -
appears that BONITO is represented by SALTEN RUDENBERG, oa
the attormey.

The subject and GRANN then had a discussion
concerning a book dealing with JOSEPH KENNEDY, the father
of the President, and GRANN expressed the opinion that
the President and the Attorney General do not know what
to do since up until recently their father has been
directing all their activities,
