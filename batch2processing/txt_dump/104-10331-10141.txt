SUBJECT: (U) “The Office of Inspector General
, January 1952-December 1971°

(U) The Presidential Assassination Review Board staff
has asked to read the subject document for possible
relevance to their work, for the period covering June 1962
to December 1964. We have selected the attached segments as
falling within the bounds of their request.

(U) We would like you to obtain permission from the IG .
for this purpose. In the unlikely event that we are ;
requested to declassify the documents for the assassination
record then that becomes a different ball game, subject to
further review. - As you know the staffers we deal with are
fully cleared. :
