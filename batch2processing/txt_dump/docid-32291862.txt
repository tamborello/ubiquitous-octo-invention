Personnel of this offic pent the day of 8/25/67 at
the golf club in Cuernavaca with fiegative results. They noted
that this is a’9-hole course and not a particularly good one,
Because it was considered that the course would not offer an
interesting daily challenge to a dedicated golfer, it was speculated
the Subject might be playing at one of the Mexico City courses,
for example, the Club de Golf which is a championship course and
located on the far south side. of Mexico ia and therefore, only

   

   

about a 40-minute drive from Cuernavaca. (

Inasmuch as at this time it appears that coverage of
golf courses offers the best possibility of definitely establishing
Subject*s presence and activities in Mexico, it is requested that
Chicago furnish Mexico City with any available information con-
cerning Subject’s golfing habits, his attire, whether he usually
plays alone, his ability, equipment, etc. In addition, there is
some possibility that his clubs in the United States may have
furnished him entry to a club in Mexico, although he could also
undoubtedly. f° entry through his attorney or other contacts

. %.

Further contacts with Mr . HARRY WRIGHT! have developed
no informatiop that Subject has been seen at thé golf club in
‘Cuernavaca. x

It is noted that Cuernavaca is not a large community
and that there has also been substantial inquiry in that area
concerning Subject. Any great amount of investigation in that
area would be likely to come to the attention of the local
residents and possibly draw the attention of the newspapers and
of Subject himself. Therefore, for the moment, the, principal
efforts jof this office are being directed toward ‘discreet checks
of areas, away from the residence, which the Eo i
&

 

. logically frequent at various hours of the day.
