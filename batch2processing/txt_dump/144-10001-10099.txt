relations; even intimate, with Mr. OSWALD, Furthermére, ‘she was
physically mistreated by the agents of the Federal Police of
your country; as a consequence of which, she bears bruises on
her arms, ‘

The Revolutionary Government feels that the gross,’ illegal
and unjustifiable manner in which the police arrested and
maltreated Mrs. DURAN corresponds to the plan of the reactionaries
that, in the United States, planned the assassination of KENNEDY
to promote a policy of retrogression and was continued on.
infamous accusations against Cuba and other countries.

The gravity implicated by the conduct of the aforementioned
police agents cannot be dismissed by the Government of Cuba.,
which considers this act a flagrant complicity of the members
of the Mexican Police with those who treacherously tried to ‘
involve our country in the filthy: crime. 4AUSC2107 (KZN)

: b (iii)

The dispicabilities, coercious and physical aggressions’
of which an employee of our consulate in Mexico City has been
the victim, constitute not only a criminal act which challenges
the judicial authorities of your country, but also the ignoring of
the minimal guarantees to which are accredited all the officials
and employees of a consular office. The transpired events are,
besides, totally unfriendly toward Cuba. “

Therefore, the Revolutionary Government.’of Cuba feels
itself in the right and with the duty of presenting before
the Government of the United States of Mexico this protest
and stating to your illustrous government that the perpetration
of these acts damage the friendly relations between both
Governments, the maintenances of which have been of profound
and demonstrated interest to the people and the Revolutionary
Government of Cuba. a

I take this opportunity. to reiterate to Your Excellency
my highest esteem. .
