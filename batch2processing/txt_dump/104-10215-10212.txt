a. Dr. Jose *BUSTANENTE Oo! Leary, psychiatrist,
was brought up by his aunts; he does not know the
identity of his mother. He, together with Raul Roa,
Justo Carrillo, and others, comes from the ranks of
the left wing of the student movement: he joined the-
Communist Party of Cuba in 1938 and, in 1944, supported
presidential candidate Dr, Carlos Saladrigas in the
presidential elections held that year. . When Dr. Grau
was elected President, Subject: concentrated. on his
professional activities, earning considerable pres-
tige and acquiring a good practice, while maintaining ’
Fa) ' his political relationships with senators, célonos, @
etc, In 1952, the year of the coup d'etat, Dr. Bustamente
had such friendly relations with both presidential
.. candidates that, if the general elections scheduled
for June. 1952 had been held, Subject would have been
made (a) Vice-Minister of Foreign Relations if Dr. Agramonte
had been elected, and (b) Minister without cartera
(portfolio) if Dr. Hevia had been elected.

b. After the.10 March 1952 coup d'etat,”
Subject_opposed the de facto government in |
Spite of. nis ciose relations with Dr. MORALES
del Castillo, who offered Subject tne post of
Consulting Counsellor (Consejero Consult ivo)

conspire against the regime with Justo Carrillo
and Dr. Araujo, constituting the organization ~

’ to maintain a close relationship with Dr. Araujo.
now President of. the Cuban Medical College,
Professor of the School of Medical Sciences of
Havana University, and functionary of the Higher
Nervous Activity Research Institute.

ce. After the 1 January 1959 Revolution,
Subject hastened to exploit the Communist con

. tent. of the Revolution and participated directly
in the denunciation of Dr. Urrutia. One of

‘Urrutia's assistants was Subject's patient and
informed Sutject of events occurring within the
Presidential Palace, Subject then consulted with
Raul Castro and denounced Dr. Urrutia as anti-
Communist.

d. Subject is very intelligent, very com-
petent, and an extraordinarily hard worker, He
is Professor of Psychology at the Havana University
Medical School, and Director of the Higher Nervous €
Activity Research Institute. During the decade :
1950-60, he held a high post within the Cuban
Medical College and was President of the World

 

visits to the USA on matters related to:his pro-
fessional activities. . eT oy
. e. It has been commented that Subject performed
“brain washing" activities for the Havana DSE.

‘During the period in 1966 that subsource was held
prisoner at Villa Marista, he did not see Subject;
subsource has never heard anyone state that he
actually saw Subject at Villa Marista. In subsource's
opinion, if Subject has ever worked for the MININT,
it was probably as professor of psychology in classes
given to MININT personnel; subsource presumes that
the classes would have been similar to those that
Subject gave to Cuban artists.

- f. In 1956, Subject acquired an extraordinarily
beautiful mistress that he still continues to visit — 4
. and support. This mistress, Manolita Canto, was
divorced by her husband, Salup (fnu), after a. private
' detective hired by the husband surprised Subject and
Canto in a hotel room in Miami, Florida; subsequently,
U.S. immigration authorities prohibited Subject from
entering the U.S.A. Canto had. had one son by her -
husband; when her husband died, the son inherited
the father's wealth, which was considerable. The
laws against private property promulgated by the
Castro regime undermined Canto's economic position
to the point that she has had.to go to work; she now
works at the INIT (National Tourist Industry Institute),
located at 23-and L Streets, Vedado, Havana City.

b. Subject is President or Director of the { |

t

 

Activity Institute), Academy of Scicnees: subsource
thinks that Subject is also Professor of Medical

Psychology at Havana University. Subject is a very

well trained psychiatrist and has always enjoyed
great prestige as such; nevertheless, he has always
been reputed to have véry low morals, and in medical
circles is "famous" as a woman chaser. He is widely
reputed to attempt to seduce his female patients and
his colleagues’ wives. Major Bernabe ORDAZ ,
Director of Havana Psychiatric Hospital, considers
Subject to be a vulgar political schemgr utterly
lacking in personal prestige among Cuban "new"
Communists; Ordaz has stated that he considers that
Subject wants to control Cuban psychiatric practice
for his ovn personal benefit.

 

‘
i
i
i

c. When Castro took power, Subject surprisingly
abandoned the Immediate Action medical doctors! party 1
and joined the recently organized Revolutionary Medical
Party; Ordaz did not join this party until 1960.

In medical circles, Subject is reputed to collaborate
with the DSE in brain-washing activities, but subsource
had never seen any direct indications of such , *,

collaboration. ., NEA
‘ ia MAP YS ge:

d. /Dr/ ‘Armando *DE CORDOVA , Psychiatrist“
employed as a professor at Havana University, is
a good psychiatrist about 70 years old vho has always
been.a leftist but is not the type of immoral .person
that Bustamante is. De Cordoba and Bustamante travel : :
together to aimost a1] the psychiatric congrésses
held abroad; according to Major Bernabe Ordaz, the two
of them would like to take over the Havana Psychiatric
Hospital, and base their desire on the fact that Ordaz
is not a psychiatrist. In subsource's opinion, they
will never be successful in replacing Ordaz, because
Ordaz enjoys the backing of both Fidel Castro and
Celia Sanchez, who are good friends of his.

 

e. Subsource has known a Dr.-Fdnundo GUTIERREZ
Agramonte, Psychiatrist, since 1959; Gutierrez is
Director of the magazine of Havana Psychiatric Hospital
and attends psychiatric congresses held abroad. He is
a competent psychiatrist and has an office located on
Calle 23, corner of Calle 18, Vedado, Havana City:
In subsource's opinion, he is antiregime although he

 

speaks in favor of the regime when with proregime F
persons, and against the-regime when with antireginc &
. persons. He does not belong.to the PCC cell at the fA
.

“ hospital and is not a militiaman, In an assembly held
-at the hospital in 1969 with the express purpose of

   

increasing the number of members of the PCC cell, no
one proposed Gutierrez as a possible aspirant. Gutierrcy
is about 50 years old and was married about February 196

to the PCC cell at the Hospital, in aa assembly
held in 1969, but stated that he had a defect
consisting in the fact that he was in love. Subsource
did not know whether he was accepted as an aspirant.
In mid-December 1969, Dr. Cristino Cabello, employed
as a psychiatrist at Havana Psychiatric Nospital,
told subsource that Mignagaray had told him that he
(Cabello) would have to take over Miguitgaray's ward
because he was going abroad to attend a psychiatric
congress; subsource could give no further information
on the congress or Mignagaray's date of departure.

Havana University, when both were members of the
Havana University Catholic Group, and later as members

Fernandez was mentioned as ‘an example of integrity.
Other prisoners such as Dr. Andres CAO , Juan
