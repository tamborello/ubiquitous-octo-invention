Subject: Substantive Error Write-Up

Investigation based on information furnished to the
Detroit office on 6/26/67 by John Burkman, a gun
dealer in Northville, Michigan. Burkman advised ©

he had been in touch a few years ago with Jose,Cardoza
(Cardosa) who wanted to buy guns. A third Person
(protected informant) was also present. Informant
told Burkman they were planning guerilla-type activity
against Castro. Cardosa said he had been visited

by the "Duque" group regarding purchase of arms.
Cardosa could not locate any arms as all sources
indicated they needed U.S. approval.

Cardosa was allegedly expelled from ECA in 1963. In
an 11/7/62 interview, he admitted contacting Burkman
and that he made arrangements to obtain 1,200 blasting
caps on behalf of an anti-Castro organization in

1962. :
