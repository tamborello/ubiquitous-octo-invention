® 1 STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CLARENCE M. KELLEY ,
: 2 DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
3 5 Mr. Kelley. Thank you very much, Senator Church and
4 gentlemen.
5 I welcome the interest which this Committee has shown in
6 the FBI and most particularly in our operations in the intelli
7 gence and internal security fields.
8 I share your high regard for the rights guaranteed by the
9 Constitution and laws of the United States. Throughout my
10 35 year career in law enforcement you will find the same insis
il tence, as has been expressed by this Committee, upon programs
F 12 of law enforcement that are themselves fully consistent with
8
ef 13 law.
3
14 I also have strongly supported the concept of legislative
15 oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment as Director of
16 the FBI and was being considered by the Senate Judiciary
17 Committee two and one half years ago, I told the members of
18 that Committee of my firm belief in Congressional oversight.
19 This Committee has completed the most exhaustive study
| 20 of our intelligence and security operations that has ever been

21 undertaken by anyone outside the FBI other than the present

22 Attorney General. At the outset, we pledged our fullest

 

23 cooperation and promised to be as candid and forthright as

24 possible in responding to your questions and complying with your

4 You have talked to the personnel who conduct security-type

Vi] You have attended numerous briefings by FBI officials who
8 have sought to familiarize the Committee and its staff with
9 all major areas of our activities and operations in the national

10 security and intelligence fields,
il In brief, you have had firsthand examination of these
12 matters that is unmatched at any time in the history of the

13 Congress.

14 As this Committee has stated, these hearings have, of

15 necessity, forcused largely on certain errors and abuses. I
16 credit this Committee for its forthright recognition that the
17 hearings do not give a full or balanced account of the PRI's
18 record of performance.

19 It is perhaps in the nature of such hearings to focus

20 on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments of the
21 organization.

22 The Counterintelligence Programs which have received the

23 lion's share of public attention and critical comment constituted

24 an infinitesimal portion of our overall work.

General Levi tomorrow, and with both the FBI and the Justice
Department in the next months as the Committee considers
recommendations that will strengthen the American people's
confidence in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That
confidence is vital for the effective enforcement of Federal
law and for the security of the nation against foreign
espionage.

Director Kelley, we are pleased to welcome you, and if
you would have a prepared statement you would like to lead off

with, please proceed.

Kelley took charge.
The Staff has advised the Committee that under Director
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse. The
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli
gence operations, and less on purely domestic surveillance.
The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in
developing policies and standards for intelligence. These
are welcome developments.

Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved.

‘Therefore, we have invited Director Kelley to share with the

Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress

should take into account in thinking about the future of

FBI intelligence. Among these issues are whether FBI surveil-|

lance should extend beyond the investigation of persons
likely to commit specific crimes; whether there should be
outside supervision or approval before the FBI conducts certai
types of investigations or uses certain surveillance technique
whether foreign related intelligence activities should be
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement
functions, and what should be done to the information already
in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in
the future.

The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange

of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney

2 3 Mr. Kelley was appointed Director in July of 1973 ina
4 troubled time for the FBI. His experience as an innovative
5 law enforcement administrator in charge of the Kansas City
6 Police Department for over ten years, and his previous work as

7 a Special Agent of the FBI have made him uniquély qualified

8 to lead the Bureau.

9 _ The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation

10 extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over
LL the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the

12 openness of the FBI's witnesses before this Committee, and

13 their willingness to consider the need for legislation to

14 clarify the Bureau's intelligence responsibility.
15 It is important to remember from the outset that this

16 Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's

 

 

17 activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic
18 intelligence operations. We have consistently expressed our
2 19 admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative
: 20 and law enforcement work, and we recognize the vital importanc
: 21 of counterespionage in the modern world. But domestic
ri 22 intelligence has raised many difficult questions.
i 23 The Committee has also concentrated on the past rather
= 24 than on present FBI activities. The abuses brought to light
