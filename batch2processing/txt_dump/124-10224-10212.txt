‘MEMORANDUM -FOR-MR. CRAIN

Ret Opposition to BATISTA Government \

Reference is made to the conference held in the office of the Ambassador
on 7 May, attended by the Ambassador, yourself, Colonel PITTS, Mr. SPEARS, and
the undérsigned. At this meeting a aécret memorandum sent by Mr. SPEARS to the
Aubassador, entitled "JUNTA REVOLUCIONARIA CONSTITUCIONAL", was discussed.

Tn’ connection with the above, enclosed herewith are photostatic copies of
an envelope (Exhibit A) ‘and enclosures addressed to "Srta. Violeta CANO,

Empedrado 211, Apt. 18, Habana, Cuba", -postmarked Miami, Florida, 6:30 P.M.,
“23 March, 1952, the. envelope bearing return address. "Hotel Vereen, 313-315 North
Miami Aves, Miami, Florida" and a notation under the AIR HAIL sticker, "Para
Rosa." This envelope and contents were intercepted in the mail. It is possible
that this communication may be pertinent to the contents of Mr. SPEARS!

memorandum,

 

At the moment, the only information this office, has been able to secure on
the addressee, Violeta CANO, is that her father, Prospero CANO, is a radio
Operator employed by Western Union in Habana.

: As of. possible interest, a study of the enclosed exhibits indicates the
following:

Exhibit B is a piece of stationery from the Hotel Vereen, in which were
enclosed Exhibits € through K. : :

Coos Exhibit C apparently concerns the Location where Gervasio Street meets
Avenida de Maceo (also known as the Malecon). ‘The small circles on this plan
describe the traffic buttons which divide the westbound traffic from the eastbound
traffic on. this wide avenue. A study of this drawing would lead one to believe
that the "x-s" represent armed men, the little squares marked "1 ~ 2-1 - 2" are
automobiles without drivers which would be used to block traffic. The "x-s"
representing men on foot here total 14, which total when added onto the number of
men included in the other exhibits brings the. grand total of men to be used in =
this operation to 230, which coincides with the figure represented on Exhibit D.
