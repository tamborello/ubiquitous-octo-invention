lL. . The matter of the request of the FBI, through
Mr. Papich, that we polygraph Rojas VILLANUEVA, a Mexican
subject with whom the Bureau has had contact in Mexico, to
resolve the allevzations he has made concerning invoivement
in the assassination of President Kennedy, was discussed with
Mr. Papich on 10 February 1964, at which time he was advised
by me and Mr. Whitten that this Agency did not desire to
suoject Roja VILLANUEVA to a polygraph examination in Mexico
and felt that the matter should be resolved in some other way.
He was advised that the case of ALVARADO was different because
we knew that ALVARADO would be sent promptly back to Niceragua.
Mr. Papich was advised that this Agency would consider poly-
graphing Rojas VILLANUEVA in Texas if this was the desire of
the Bureau, but to do so we would of course necessarily have’
to obtain the permission of the Director.

 

2. Mr. Papich was subsequently informed that we were in
a position to polygraph the Subject in Texas at the Bureau's
request; the Director's permission having been obtained, should
this be the desire of the Bureau. Mr. Papich advised, nowever,
on 20 February that the Bureau was not requesting at this time
that he be pol yeraphed in Texas and the Bureau's present plans
are to endeavor to resolve the matter some way in Mexico.
