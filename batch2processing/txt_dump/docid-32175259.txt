desired to leave the impression that he was cooperating
but in fact he was not. His answers were evasive,
indefinite and uninformative. It was believed that his
attorney had instructed him to respond in this manner

-and it was felt that he may have been urged by ANGEL

and depth of the FBI investigation rather than chance
having the FBI dispense with the inter oview completely
if he insisted on counsel, ;
