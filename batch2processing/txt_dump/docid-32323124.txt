DL 134-1A-645A

ESTRADA informed BILL. LOWERY and. JOE LANDIN that —
-he had spoken to two. persons about. Miss RUSSELL. and had.received
.$10 as a.centribution. The fee, he. said, would-be easily -
raised, sponsoring MAUDE RUSSELL would be the thing. They
(the CP) could not do it. It would be up.to.the ROSSES or. the
LAWRENCES, They discounted the ROSSES because they are
separated. -AUGUSTIN said he would ask JOE.LAWRENCE to sponsor
MAUDE RUSSELL. BILL. LOWERY said: that if. the LAWRENCES were
able to, he would ask NATALIE ROSS if her house .could.be used
for the meeting even. though she could.not be. present. BILL
LOWERY gave ESTRADA instructions | on how.to.get.a hold of JOE
‘LAWRENCE (by: phone).

ESTRADA and LOWERY had a long discussion on fall out
and the qutlawing of the CP. ESTRADA said such a ruling would
certainly hurt the party - but would not stop it. . The. party's
-headquarters have for.a.time been just a.front.. Besides. this
: sort of persecution would align other. organizations with the
party for they could be next. BILL. LOWERY agreed, saying the

. outlawing of the CP gave them more company. - ESTRADA, as.an

‘example, ‘said that if LOWERY was.ever. arrested his co-workers
.in the'G.i. Forum, Dad's Club would come to his. rescue.

JOE LANDIN told them he. did not.agree with them,.-he
doubted if any non-communist organization would. ever be out-.
lawed and doubted if any. arrested CP member would. be. defended

. by- his. friends or co-workers. . He asked. them .to..make. realistic

  

‘deductions. -.just who. could, they. turn to besides, th U?

» BILL. LOWERY. sa their only, et ise.. ‘would be: the.,.p ple. they

had worked. with in: mass organizations, they. would come. to their
rescue. He rated the interest JOE.LAWRENCE had in the.out-
lawing the CP, He assured. JOE LANDIN there: were others like
him. . JOE LANDIN said he understood the situation much better
now.that. BILL. LOWERY had explained. about JOE: LAWRENCE, : :

    

Informant -had- no additional information.
