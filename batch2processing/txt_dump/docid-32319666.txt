The enclosed letterhead is from Mexico City, It
sets forth speculations of Mora that Oswald could be linked
to Mexice only through his activities prior to going to
USSR in 1959, Mora indicated that tie in to Mexico may lie
in press referenced to Oswald's activities in New Orleans ;
for the few days he was in that area prior to going to Russia ;
in September, 1959, when he was 19 years old, She also said we
that Oswald knew Mary Louise Batterson, an American negress
presently attending the Friendship School in USSR when he was
in Russia; hence we are furnishing copies of letterhead to —
CIA, Our sourcesin contact with Mera (the highly placed a
Mex-18 and Mex-19) anticipated spending a few days with Mora,
who has been ill, during first two weeks of April; however,
they cannot assure us that Mora will be well enough for
recontact as she has been i1]1 for a long time,
