The MANNARINOs have purchased some new property near Camp
Jo-An, Pa., in Westmoreland County. A New Kensington, Pa.,
‘peal estate agent, A. F, BOYER, handled the transaction.

On 5/3/61, PG 615-C advised SA FORSYTH:

As yet, KELLY MANNARINO has not installed a telephone at his
cottage near Leechburg, Pa., When he wishes to make a

telephone call, he goes down Old Leechburg Road about a

quarter of a mile to a Meadow Gold Dairy farm and uses a coin
telephone. It is believed, however, that when MANNARINO .
commences permanent summer residence at the cottage, which 3

is imminent, he will want a telephone installed on the G/
premises, ~

ED IN GA. 29 JP ~

Pittsburgh will remain in contact with the local telephone

company official who can advise when a telephone application
is made by MANNARINO,:
