San

gang of New Kensingt: Pas “Front man for the concession at the ‘Sans Souc
NORMANZROTHMA Ne Wn

One of the chief sources of income for the concession at the San,
Souci is a game called "Razzle Dazzle" used at carnivals and similar
entertainments. It is based on a doubling up principle and so far as we *‘
have been able to learn locally, the sucker never has a chance on this game.”
The Embassy has received numerous complaints here from American tourists
who have been taken in amounts from a few hundred dollars to several thousands. (Wu

 

From the standpoint of the concession, the chief drawback of the
game is the fact that the loser usually does not have sufficient cash money .
? to pay his Losses and gives the club a check. Usually, the following day C.
when the sucker has had time to sober up and realize he has been taken, he ~
calls or wires his U. S. bank and stops payment on the check. The concession
’ has little recourse against this action since the check represents a gambling

loss.

It will be emphasized to the sucker that the check cashing office has 3
nothing to do with the Sans Souci operation and that the operation is 2
strictly one of exchanging a check for cash money. By doing this it is ba
hoped to get away from the fact. that .the check covers a gambling loss and wy,

ON CONTAINED

On 9-12-52 C. I. HAV-11 advised that he had learned that the Sang

Souci Night Club in Havana is having considerable financial difficulties

and that it appeared t @ new management might be taking it over. As

will be recalled, rom con has been fronting at the Sans Souci for

the MANNARINO interes Kensington, PA. Source said that he was

* told that ROTHMAN and EDD MAN, ROTHMAN's assistant at the Sans Souci,
had gone to Miami on 9-11-52, taking with them all the books of the Sans
Souci. Source expressed the opinion that they might be doing this in order
to run out on any debts tha N might have incurred in connectién with
the operation of the club.

Source said that CHARLES F. “cHucK SREEER, who had fronted at
the Sans Souci a couple of years ago, bad been in. town looking over the
situation es logking possibly toward the resumption of the management of

bh aXe IXY,

the club.

On 9-15-52 source advised that ROTHMAN had come back to Havana
and that he had brought the word that the man who will be backing the club
for the coming year is one ANDREA. Source said that he had been unable to
get any additional information other than that he supposed to
Chicago and to own a hoiie in Miami Beach.) j
