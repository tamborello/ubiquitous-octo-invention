King plot,
local motel

By Wire Services and Staff Writers
A hideaway motel in Apalachin reportedly was
the scene of a 1968 meeting where FBI and CIA
agents offered former gangland kingpin Carlo
Gambino $1 million to kill Martin Luther King

| Jr., Scripps-Howard Newspapers said yesterday.

The allegation was made by an inmate at the
Ohio Penitentiary Reception and Treatment Cen-
ter in Columbus. Gambino reportedly rejected’
the offer.

The report said the inmate, Myron Billett, set
up a secret meeting in January 1968, at a motel in
Apalachin between the FBI and CIA agents and
Gamibino, who has since died. .

The name and location of the motel could not

; be determined last night and it was not known if

the motel is still in business.

Apalachin was the scene of a 1957 state police
raid of a convention by organized crime bosses,
hosted by the late Joseph Barbara Sr.

Scripps-Howard Newspapers, in a copyrighted
story. by William Pillar, said Billett, 52, alias
Paul Buccilli, will be questioned by Ed Evans,
chief investigator for the House Select’ Commit-
tee on Assassinations in Washington.

Gambino rejected the offer and later passed
the word that no gangland family would accept
the offer to kill King, Billett said.

Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, chairman of the

; assassinations committee, said he ordered Evans

to investigate the allegations after Scripps-
Howard asked Stokes if a letter sent by Billett to
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill had been turned

’ over to the committee.

54957 Doolid:

his story.” Evans said.

O’Neill’s office told the newspapers that the
letter had not been located.
“We will be in touch with Billett to check cut

““f APALACHIN ~— Some residents and motel

Managers in Apalachin were puzzled yesterday

, by reports that a motel in the hamlet may have

been the site of a meeting where CIA and FBI
agents offered a former gangland chief $1 million
to kill Martin Luther King Jr.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations
in Washington yesterday said it will question an
inmate at an Ohio penitentiary who claims he set
up the secret meeting with Carlo Gambino in
1968. The motel was not identified.

Some residents and motel managers of this
Tioga County community expressed mixed feel-
ings about their town hitting the limelight as a
gangland gathering place. None of those who
were interviewed could say where the meeting
may have been held.

“Jt just looks bad” for the town. But some
people say it is unlikely that the Mafia would
haj e returned to the scene of the crime after

’ said one resident.

Apalachin talks of motels

In 1957, state police raided a convention of

organized crime bosses at, the Apalachin home of
the late Joseph Barbara Sr.

“Sure it could have happened. A lot of weird
people and things happened here when we were
open. But if they came, I would think they’d have
been quiet and inconspicuous about it. I can’t
remember anything about it,” said one motel
manager, Donna Tryon.

Tryon helped her father Stanley Payne manage
an il-cabin motel between West Main Street and:
Route 434 until it was closed in 1969.

Albert Vizak, manager of the Real Motel on the |
border of Tioga and Broome counties, said he .
doubted that his motel was used for the meeting.

Ray Sawyer, who managea anoter move: un
Route 434, said his cabins were closed during the
winter and could not haye been used,

‘Yhere are two other motels in the Apalachin «
area: the Apalachin Tavern, which has motel
rooms, and the Bennett Motel, on the" border, of 1
Broome and Tioga counties. f
