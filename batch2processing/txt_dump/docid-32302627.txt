on 4/7/64 he deposited a check for
$13,945.50 which was drawn on the Bank of Las Vegas. These
checks probably represent the purchase and sale of ice
machines. It is recalled that recently LA 4145-C furnished
information that ROSSELLI had recently purchased 24 ice cube-
making machines from Ajax West Coast Corporation, Santa
Barbara, for resale to the Desert Inn Hotel, Las Vegas,
Nevada.

On 4/7/64 ROSSELLI also deposited fifteen checks
in small amounts totaling $41.74 which probably represent
dividends from investments in oil leases as some of the

checks are drawn on Texas banks from which banks ROSSELLI
has in the past received checks for oil lease dividends.
