Re: SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR.
92-2781

It is noted that there is some concern on the part of the telephone company
as to what effect the installation of equipment across the telephone line would have
on the ringing of the subscriber's telephone instrument. While the Laboratory has
in no facilities to check the effect on ringing in a system using the frequencies set
forth in your letter of 10-30-61, it is felt that the impedance of the unit is
un sufficiently high that ringing will not be affected.

   
 
   
    
  
   
  
  
    
 
   
  
 

 

 

 

In order that the Laboratory may have a complete diagrammatic layout of
the subjects' services, it is desired that you submit cable prints of the feeder and,
_ distribution cables in the areas in close proximity to the subjects’ residences as
well as the area you propose for a monitoring site or sites. You should ascertain ae
from sources in the General Telephone Company of Florida, the identity of a woe
normally closed ringing relay that will respond to the ringing frequencies of the ;
lines involved and advise the Bureau the source of the relays. In addition, you
‘should ascertain the ringing voltage, talk voltage and operate current for subjects"
» telephone service. -

 

° wee . f in
You will note that emphasis has been placed on! the use of the telephone.
instrument for disguise. You may determine, after a ‘survey, that you. have a ‘
telephone service outlet which will afford better microphone coverage than the
telephone instrument. If such is the case, the electronic switching device can be
bridged across the line at the outlet or at any place where security and time permit
=p, concealing the microphone, electronic switch and its associated wires and connect~
ing same to the subject's telephone line."” <**.

In the event you are able, through telephone company cooperation or

. otherwise, to/ubstitute a telephone instrument which has been, altered to incorporate -
