that WORTMAN and his associates at one time had an undisclosed
interest in the California Club, Ias Vegas, ‘but. evidence
was not sufficient or of the proper type to be used in a
proceeding for revocation of the gambling license of the
California Club, GALLAGHER said information had been
received from a source considered reliable, that the
WORTMAN investmaat in the California Club had been
withdrawn.

 

on March 28, 1958, informant SU 371-C
advised it is that informant 's pelief that WORTMAN and
his associates still tatnhdin an undisclosed interest in
the California Club, Las Vegas. This belief by the informant
is based primarily on the fact that THOMAS STERLING, Pit
Boss at the California Club, originally came from East
St. Louis, Illinois where he had worked most of his life
in gambling clubs.

In about. June 1958, ARQUILLA sold 60% of
his interest in the California Club to one JAMES P, LONG,
Pit Boss of the Tropicana Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada. The
price was reported to be $435,000, however, ARQUILIA did
not receive the tot&i amount in eash, having accepted
notes payable at a future date.

 

 

 

Attorney ARTHUR HAMM, JR., Las Vegas, advised
on a confidential basis, that ARQUILLA made application to
buy 123% interest in the New Frontier Hotel, on the "Strip",
Las Vegas, Nevada. The application regarding the New
Frontier Hotel did not materialize and on September 9,

1958, ARQUILLA acquired approximately 58% of the Westerner
Club, 23 Fremont Street, downtown Las Vegas. According

to WILLIAM GALLAGHER, Nevada State Tax Commission,
ARQUILLA paid approximately $138,000 for this share in the
Westerner Club.

On March 18, 1959, informant SU 396-C advised .-
that informant recéived information that ARQUILLA was
making efforts to dispose of his interest in the Westerner
Club but no sale had yet been made. Sergeant BEN COMPTON,

acceptable on the basis of information known at that time,

The Desert Inn is one of a nutiber of
prominent hotel and gambling, spots on the "strip" at
Las Vegas. The Star Dust Hotel, since its opening, has
been one of the most successful from the standpoint of
popularity, The ability of the owners of the Desert Inn
who acquired control of the Star Dust Hotel, and who.
successfully promote its operation, might be considered
as some degree of inflwvence by this group.

D. How Influence is Exercised

 

No information is available that any
unusual exercise of influence by this group has been used,
Since gambling is a legai business in Nevada, the operation
of the Desert Inn and other similar ventures is not considered
to be a business front except to the extent of being an
investment of funds which may have been acquired through
gambling in other states where it is considered illegal.

E. Illegal Methods of Furthering Business
: Interests :

: . No information is available at this time
that the Desert Inn group has used violence or any illegal
means to stifle competition or to further their own business

B. How rnfiuenoeai-Cintvol Acquired

 

WILBUR CLARK was. a relatively unimportant
gambler in California prior to 1947, In that year he came
to Las Vegas where he started construction of a large hotel
on the "“strip;' which is the highway just outside Las Vegas
in the direction of Los Angeles. CLARK formed a corporation
under the name Wilbur Clark, Incorporated; and stock was
issued, The principals of this corporation were members of
his family and associates from California, Toward the end
of 1947, construction of the hotel (Desert Inn) was stopped
because of lack of Aunds, labor problems, and material
shortages.

~ In November, 1950, CLARK testified before

the Kefauver Committee at Las Vegas. He related that progress

on the Desert Inn was virtually stopped from late 1947 to _

1949, at which time a man named RODISON brought in KLINEMAN

and DALITZ from Cleveland who arranged to raise money for

completion of the hotel. The Cleveland group acquired
-%5 per cent ownership, and the remaining 25 per cent was

heid by CLARK and some of the original promoters. The hotel

started operation in April 1950. CLARK became President; .
KLINEMAN became Vice President; and DALITZ became Treasurer.

 

Informant SU 370-C advised that on.
September 10, 1958, CLARK and his Desert Inn associates
took over the hotel portion of the Star Dust Club, which
has more than 1,000 rooms. The same group also managed
the Royal Nevada Hotel on October 9, 1958, The Royal
Nevada Hotel is located adjacent to the Star Dust Hotel ,
and contains about 200 rooms. The informant said the _ ‘
Royal Nevada will be operated only as a hotel, without
gambling. “0

The records of the Nevada State Tax
Commission show that CLARK had a 5 per cent interest in the
Royal Nevada operation.
