: Subsequent, the above interview, RUSSELL BROWN
contacted Senor SANTIAGOASUAREZ, Mexican Consul at Corpus Christi,
who is a close friend of BROWN, inasmuch as subject LARIN had indi-
cated her acquaintance with him. SUAREZ was not notified of the
Bureau's interest in subject LARIN, and advised that he first became
acquainted with her in New York City, having met her at a social -
function there. .

SUAREZ stated that LILIA LARIN is supposed to be the . \

widow of Senor LARIN, a famous Mexican candy manufacturer ‘whose
products are as well known in Mexico as Wrigley's chewing gum in
the United States." He advised that if she actually is this indi-
vidual, she is undoubtedly a wealthy woman. SUAREZ stated that with-
in the past week, subject LARIN had contacted him for the purpose of
obtaining a letter to some officials in Paris, France, in order to

' arrange the immigration of a Polish family from France into the
United States. She did not supply any particulars as to the identity
of the immigrants, but stated that she would return at a later date,
which she never did. | :

. Senor SUAREZ stated that no Europeans are presently
allowed to enter Mexico without a Permit from the Secretaria de
Gobernacion, and that. subject VON MOHRENSCHILDT would be unable to
accompany ‘subject LARIN unless he procured such a Permit. He advised
that Senora LARIN had discussed this matter with him and was presently
attempting to obtain a Permit from the Mexican Consul at Laredo, Texas.

_ The above facts were telephonically related to Special
Agent KENNETH LOGAN on June 3, 1941, and thé information was furnished
to the San Antonio Field Division by teletype, request being made of
that office to arrange for a search: of subject's personal effects and
baggage on entrance into Mexico and upon return.
