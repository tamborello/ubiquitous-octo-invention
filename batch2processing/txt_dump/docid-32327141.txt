7 TO BECOME ACTIVE IN ORGANIZED CRIME HERE. CAIN HAS :
DEVELOPED A “BRAZEN” ATTITUDE AND AS EXAMPLE WHEN HE READ
RECENT NEWSPAPER PUBLICITY THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL MITCHELL
ANNOUNCED THAT BACK OF ORGANIZED CRIME IN CHICAGO HAD BEEN
BROKEN BECAUSE NO CAPABLE LEADER COULD BE FOUND TO LEAD
ORGANIZATION HERE, CAIN TOLD MORAN "MITCHELL HAS A NEW
CANDIDATE NOW".

MORAN ADVISED THAT IMMEDIATELY UPON HIS ARRIVAL IN
CHICAGO FROM PRISON, CAIN MADE TWO APPOINTMENTS. ONE Was
WITH FIORE BUCCIERI, UPPER ECHELON LEADER OF ORGANIZED CRIME

HERE, AND OTHER WAS WITH PAT MARCY, LEADER CHICAGO'S FIRST
WARD DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION WITH WHOM CAIN WAS CLOSE To
WHEN HE WAS WORKING FOR GIANCANA.

PURPOSE OF MEETINGS WAS FOR CAIN TO OBTAIN JOB IN :
ORGANIZED CRIME HERE. MORAN ADVISED THAT CAIN FEELS HE i
COULD OBTAIN TOP JOB UNDER RALPH PIERCE, UPPER ECHELON |
LEADER ON SOUTH SIDE CHICAGO, WHOSE TOP LIEUTENANT, ART |
MARKLE, DIED THREE WEEKS AGO. HOWEVER, CAIN HOLDING OUT FOR |

SOMETHING BETTER ACCORDING TO WHAT HE TOLD MORAN.

ANOTHER PURPOSE OF CAIN'S MEETINGS WAS TO OBTAIN JOB
FOR HIS FORMER WIFE, HARIETTE BLAKE, A RECORDING ARTIST.
THIS HE IMMEDIATELY DID AT MANGAM'S CHATEAU, A FIRST CLASS
WEST SUBURBAN NIGHT CLUB WHERE BLAKE OPENED LAST NIGHT.

IT IS DEFINITE FEELING OF MORAN THAT CAIN STRIVING FOR
A TOP JOB IN ORGANIZED CRIME AND WITH CHARACTERISTIC “GALL”
FEELS HE CAN "GET THE OUTFIT MOVING AGAIN” WITHOUT PARTICULAR
JEOPARDY TO HIMSELF. MORAN FEELS CAIN WOULD DEFINITELY
TAKE TOP JOB ALTHOUGH SINCE HE REMAINS ON PROBATION UNTIL
APRIL, SEVENTYTWO, WILL PROBABLY WAIT TO MAKE "TOO MANY
MOVES” UNTIL THEN.

IT IS OPINION OF CHICAGO OFFICE THAT MORAN'S
INFORMATION IS UNDOUBTEDLY ACCURATE. CAIN IS EGOTISTICAL,
SHARP, INTELLIGENT AND AMBITIOUS AND CLOSE TO GIANCANA IN
PAST. IT WOULD NOT BE PAST HIM, IN FRAME OF MIND HE
APPARENTLY IS IN, TO ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN NEAR LEADERSHIP
POSITION IN ORGANIZED CRIME HERE AND TO ATTEMPT To
