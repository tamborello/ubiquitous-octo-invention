This is the second time Wilson has

II. John Wilson Hudson File

 

A review of Hudson's CIA DDO file indicates that ina report

 

fron Jaatea August 8, 1957 or 1951 a source

 

 

was of the opinion that "Wilson was very probably an intelligence

 

agent and that he is under direction of some service.“

 

(Report from] Jaugust 8, 1951,or 1957) On

 

October 6, 1959, a memorandum for the record reported that
Hudson was arrested with Paul Hugues in Cuba and that,

{ Wilson may be summarized as a
person of intelligence, but so
erratic as to be considered
mentally unbalanced at ; :
time. He is a soldier of. fortune, ‘having ~.
begun his career in July 1936 when he left
Oxford to fight in Spain. He has been
accused of working for the intelligence
services of several countries, and he
himself has claimed to have acted on
behalf of different intelligence services.
He has been consistently anti-United States.

 

(Memo for the record 6 Oct. 1959, subj: "Carl John Wilson
Hudson.) :

 

A 201 file request was submitted from[ Jon October
29, 1959. (201 File Request, from WH/I/Chi#te,]10/29/59)
