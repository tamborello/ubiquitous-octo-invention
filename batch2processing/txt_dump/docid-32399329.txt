1. At the time the request was submitted to convert Subject from Con-
tract Agent to Career Agent status, a provisional covert security clearance
was granted for that purpose. KUSODA recently advised that a full covert
security clearance had been granted for the use of Subject as Principal
Agent, under official cover, in Project AMPHODARCH, in accordance with the
provisions set forth in the memorandum of the Chief, KUBARK, dated 14 Feb-
ruary 1949, entitled "Security and Operational Clearances."

2. At the same time, KUSODA requested the following action to be taken:

a. That full overseas traces and such actual overseas
investigation as is possible be taken on Subject and
his wife and her family; and,

be That arrangements be madd to have Subject affronted with
a LCFLUITER test as soon as feasible.

3. Headquarters has already initiated the action set forth in Para 2 (a)
requesting full traces and investigation of Subject and his wife and her.
family. in Panama City and San Jose. To date only San Jose has replied with
HRSA-2938, copy of which was sent to Habana. Station Habana is requested to
take appropriate action to cover Subject's and his wife's activities during
their residence in Habana, and inform Headquarters of the results.

 

4. With reference to KUSODA's request for a LCFLUTTER test on Subject,
they have expressed their desire to have Subject tested in the field as
soon as possible, or as soon as the appropriate arrangements can be made.
KUSODA has indicated that they will be happy to assist in arranging this test.

However, Headquarters would appreciate-receiving the Station's views and
comments on the matter as quickly as possible so that KUSODA may be advised
and can make the necessary planning.

5. The Station is reminded that Subjectdsof covert security clearances
are not to represent themselves as, nor are they to be represented as,
employees of KUBARK. Your attention is also called to the fact that a covert
security clegrance does not constitute complete compliance with the provisions
KUBARK Regulation 10-210. Therefore, if the station should desire ata
later date to change the status or use of Subject, a request for clearance to
cover any proposed change should be submitted to Headquarters.
