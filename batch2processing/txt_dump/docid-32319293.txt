DETAILS: On 4/21/94, the JFK Task Force transferred an
additional 146,778 pages of JFK documents to the NARA. This
brings the total number of pages transferred under the "President
John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992"
(the Act) to 331,085.

The majority of the documents transferred, 92,245
pages, were from the JFK Assassination investigation file
maintained at FBIHQ. Only 1641 pages of these documents
contained postponements. The postponements ranged from one word
or item on a page to more extensive postponements. Two hundred
nineteen pages were postponed in their entirety. An additional
406 pages were withheld because the Task Force is awaiting word
from another federal agency or foreign government on whether
information they contain can be disclosed.
