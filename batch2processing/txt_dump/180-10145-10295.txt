* 6. Field Information Report
Subject: Background, Character and Economic Concepts of Manuel Ray Rivero
Date: 16 March 1961 ;
Sources: (Dr. Oscar SALAS Marrera] (paragraphs 1-11) Knew Ray in Cuba
Dr. Jose ALVAREZ Diaz, former Minister of Finance under Prio}(Pg
‘Dr. Jorge *BERUFF;**former president of Banco de Desarrollo
“Eeonomico de cuba, (ps 13)

   
 
 

Note: Cover note pencilled comment (Thé:content is so biased and mixed
with untruth that it would be a disservice to the intelligence commnity
to disseminate it.

Synopsis of paragraphs 1-11. Dr. Salas says during his childhood Ray was

a Protestant but today is completely atheistic. Said Ray organized the MRC
against Batista and shortly after Batista's fall, MRC and 26th of July
Movement fused into one, and as soon as Castro came into power, control

of the organization was given to the Commmists. Tells of Ray's association
with Castro and that he did not resign his position when his own brother

was renounced by Castro. Stated that Ray's rupture with Fidel was due

to the fact shat Ray opposed the idea of shooting Hubert Matos as a

traitor. Ray resigned his post but said publicly that he approved and
supported the Castro regime without any mental reservations. Says in

Cuban clandestine circles Ray is regarded as boastful, ostentatious and:
deceitful. Intimate friends of Ray feel that he is a man of anti-democratic
procedures, and does not like to take advice, even from members of his own
movement.

 

Synopsis of paragraph 12. Dr. Alvarez said Ray was in favor of maintaining
relations with USSR and not making Commmist Party illegal. Said that
although Ray withdrew all these statements when threatened with press
coverage, Alvarez thinks they are representative of Ray's thinking and
would try to put ideas into practive if he ever came to power. Alverez

also mentioned Rays thinking on nationalization of public services,
socialized medicine, nationalization of banks, etc.

Synopsis of paragraph 13. Dr. Beruff said Ray well-intentioned with no
Commmist tendencies. Cited a meeting at which the basic points of the

MRP platform were discussed and said that since Ray was in disagreement with
the others on most of the points, Dr. Felipe Pazos acted as chairman of the
meeting and Ray argued his case as a simple member of the group. Out of this
meeting came a declaration of 14 points, including the nationalization of
the banks and public utilities.

On 9 March, Rey said that ideas attributed to him in paragraph 12 were not

true and part of a “campaign against him by Mr. Pawley of the Miami City
Transit Corpeny”.
