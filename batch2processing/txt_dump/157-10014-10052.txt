Mr. Wallach. Dan Brennan? s?

Mr. Cotter. Dan Brennan's section. Now, at that timo I
don't think Brennan was a section chief. I don't know for
certain, but it might have bean his predecessors in that job,
people like Graham Day.

You don't happen to know offhand when Brennan served as
section chief?

Mr. Wallach. No, I don't, but he was there.

Mr. Cotter. Also there was a foreign liaison unit in
addition. Brennan was a section chief, but there was also
a unit that supervised the operations of all legal attaches anc :
Nate Ferris was the key man in that. He was a supervisor in

charge. Now, offhand I don't remember when he, Ferris, retire®.

Wallach. He's fairly old now, isn't he?
. Cotter. He's quite old.

woe

Mr. Wallach. So to the best of your recollection,
then, at no time while you were in the Bureau --

Mr. Cotter. At no time did I receive any information,
director or indirect about an attempted assassination of
Castro by any government agency.

Mr. Wallach. Let me just for the record show you

a memorandum from Mr. Hoover dated May 10, 1962, and I want te

 

be clear for the record there is no indication you received th:s|
In fact, I doubt that you did.

Mr. Cotter. Okay-

Mr. Wallach. The memorandum deals with many different

matters, but the last page, page 6, the latter part of page & and

 

page 7 describe a conversation between Mr. Hoover and Attorne,
General Robert Kennedy in which they talk about an assassinaie |
plot. The CIA had hired the Mafia to assassinate Fidel Catgt:..
Let me show you the last paragraph of that page.

Are you able to read it?

Mr. Cotter. I think so-

Mr. Cotter. There are a few words I can't read.

Mr. Wallach." I am ‘hot! “really” ‘asking whether or not thuy

did have a patticuler high level sourca, whether a particular
person wasaa’ source.” What ta really like to know is waa:
‘the pureau"gleaning positive intelligence information from
Cuba, for example, at the time of the Bay of Pigs.

Mr. Cotter. ‘Yes, but from very fringe type sources as a
rule, refugees from Cuba, American businessmen and so forth wh.
had contacts in Cuba. A lot of it was unverified, unsubstantisc:
there wasn't too much real hard, accuratu information availabiw
to the Bureau.

Mr. Wallach. Do you know Vince Nasca?

Mr. Cotter. Yes, I do, quite weli.

Mr. Wallach. Vince is still with the Bureau, and it is
my understanding that at that time he evolved on the desk that
was working on anti-Castro groups?

Mr. Cotter. Yes, that’s true. in the pugt he's handled

both pro=Castro and anti-Castro. I think his princival speesare

‘has been anti-Castro in recent years.

Mr. Wallach. Who in your estimation would nave been or

were the people at the Bureau most knowledgeable ii the Cuban

area in late 1963?

Mr. Cotter. Certuinly Nasca. Ray Wannall, the section
