determined that the only "travel records"

were those on file in the DDA/Office of Finance.” |: =
The Office of Finance at that time prepared--. -
subject to DDO concurrence--suggested saniti-
zations of eleven (11) travel vouchers for. -. -
possible release to requester. (The vouchers 7 o
represent 11 trips made by E. Howard Hunt - in a ay

City and return. The 11 vouchers’ concerned are’
118-63, 134-63, 151-63, 170-63, 186-63, 219-63,
15-64, "55- 64, §7- 64, 121-64 and 150-64. See we
Tab D' for full text copies.) The DDO, however, ts
considered these records nonreleasable and - ms
recommended denial in toto under exemptions * -
(b) (1), (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(6).of FOIA, We ©
also noted that our principal reasons for denial‘
were, first, that release of the records would
violate Hunt's privacy and, second,’ that once

all the operational and organizational data had
been removed from the records, the remainder -..
would be useless to the requester. Subject 9°.

 

..was so advised by IPS letter of i7 September 1976

(Reference B).

c. Subject appealed our response on 21
September 1976, countering our two principal
reasons for denial with the arguments that. since |
Hunt was travelling on official Government
business using public monies, release of this
information could hardly be considered an invasion
of Hunt's persona rivacy. Concerning the second
point, Subject nee pained that he is the only... «
judge of what would be useful to him (Reference. c).

d. During the appeals review, the DDO rechecked
with DDA/Office of Finance/FOIO (Mr. Hubert N. Lacey)
concerning the Office of Finance's current position
on the releasability of Hunt's travel records.

Upon reconsideration, the Office of Finance with-
drew its previous recommendation for release of
sanitized versions and suggested that the documents

‘THROUGH . : DDO/Information Review Officer

SUBJECT : FOIA Appeal--Robert Sibley (F 76-455)

REFERENCES : A. Initial Request Letter, 19 July 1976.
; B. Initial Response, 17 September 1976.
C. Appeal Letter, 21 September 1976.

1. Summary: The DDO concurs in the position of the
DDA/Of fice of Finance/FOIO that Subject's FOIA appéal be
denied in toto..(Tab C). In view of the fact that the
Office of Finance is the office of record and repository
for the documents concerned, we recommend that the
response action for this appeal be transferred from the
DDO to the DDA.

2. Background:

a. On 19 July 1976 Robert Sibley, a Washington,
DC journalist, requested "the complete travel
records of the Chief of the covert activities section
in the Domestic Operations Division of the CIA
from January. 1, 1963 - December 31, 1963." He
stated that according to his records E. Howard Hunt
occupied that position during the requested period.
If, however, his information was incorrect, he
requested the 1963 travel records of both the chief
of the section and E. Howard Hunt. (ReFerénce A).

b. IPS referred the request to the DDO for action.
-It was determined during the initial review that
E. Howard Hunt was indeed an employee of the DDO/
Domestic Operations Division in 1963. It was further

specifically exempt from disclosure by statute---
exemption (b)(3) of FOIA. (See Tab C). .
The Office of Finance conducted a classification

office of record. for the documents concerned, we™
recommend that responsibility for the appeal |
Fesponse be transferred to the DDA. ae

b. We concur with the Office of Finance! $

exemption (b)(3) for. denial in toto of the oo.

requested documents.’ We recommend, ‘however, _— -
“that exemptions. (b) (1), (b)(2),- and’ (b)} (6) also
“be. claimed...’ Justification for these exemptions
is still valid. notwithstanding Subject's
arguments. to the contrary. Subject's point.
concerning Hunt's privacy is well-taken and
Should not have been cited as .a principal. reason
‘for denial in our initial response letter of |
17. September 1976. Exemption (b) (6), however,
“was claimed at that time to also protect the
privacy of Hunt's operational contacts who were —
‘listed on the vouchers. Both exemptions (b)(3) .
and (b)(6) apply then and now to these individuals.

c. By noting in our initial response that
sanitized versions of the documents would be use-
less to the requester (our secorid principal reason
for denial),.the implication was made that segregable

-. versions could be released, however meaningless. |

. This position was not uphe id in our appeal review.

-We concur with the Office of Finance's stand that
the requested records are in the class of documents
which are specifically exempt from disclosure by
statute and therefore should be denied in toto.
