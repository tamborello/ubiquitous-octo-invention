Details: Enclosed for Little Rock are the £ollowing file(s):

-Box 1
LR 157-15-2508 Vol. 15A

The originals removed from these files and replaced

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) pursuant to
the JFK Records Collection Act of 1992. Provision of the JFK Act

The copies contained within the previously mentioned
file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date
