telephone spot in the HARRY GROSS operation. Using toll free phones,
he has been operating in the Lake Tahoe area of Northern California,
after being raided in San Diego County on 1/11/75 by FBI Agents.

The HARRY GROSS operation is probably the largest in Southern
California. GROSS became prominent in the early fifties when he
operated the largest bookmaking syndicate in New York City. His
organization at that time, was protected by payoffs to police and
other government officials and included the operation of 27 back

In other gambljfig investigations, info

moved back into the E

‘totaled about 60 and 70 million a year and he admitted before a Grand
Jury paying almost $20,000 a month in bribes to New York City police.
GROSS, however, refused to testify against eight New York City police
officers and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Upon his
release he came to California in 1958 and set up his bookmaking
operation centered at Long Beach. Since then he has received several
convictions in California, serving prison time. He is currently
awaiting federal prosecution. In Southern California his annual
handle is estimated at around 25 million dollars. His operations
extend into Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San
Bernardino Counties.

V. JOHN S. ALESSIO
The ALESSIO family filed suit this month against the U.S.
Government seeking over fourteen million dollars in losses and

.damages related to the collapse of C. ARNHOLT SMITH's U. Ss. National
Bank and Westgate - California Corporation.

: The ALESSIO law suit charges that the U.S. Comptroller
of Currency "operated a vast cover-up to shelter the massive
illegalities and irregularities of SMITH and U. S. National Bank".
The former Comptroller, JAMES SAXON, was not cited as a defendant,
however.

ALESSIO charges the U. S. Government with misfeasance,
nonfeasance and legligence in the supervision and examination of
U. S. National Bank and its losses.

The plaintiffs include the family head, JOHN S. ALESSIO,
as well as his brothers and: son, DOMINIC "BUD" ALESSIO, and several
of their corporations, including Kodiak Industries, Del Coronado
Spa, Inc., and the Alessio Investment Company of San Diego.

The law suit seeks $153,175 in losses on U. S. National
Bank's stock (now declared insolvent); $4,057,185, as a result of
Watergate-California bankruptcy and ten million dollars for damages
because the collapse of U. Ss. National Bank eliminated their primary
source of financing. :

Ironically, at the same time that the ALESSIOs were
claiming a federal bank supervising agency was not protecting them
from SMITH's banking irregularities the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) was accusing the ALESSIO family and C. ARNHOLT
SMITH of attempting to take over fraudulently a New Mexico
corporation, which owns and operates two racetracks in New Mexico.

The firm, Fortuna Corporation, operates Sunland Race
Track and Rudioso Downs.

The SEC suit, filed in U. S. District Court, San Diego,
this month, alleges that SMITH as head of the now defunct U. S.
National Bank, helped arrange a series of circumstances enabling the
ALESSIOs to gain control of Fortuna without the knowledge of other
shareholders.

Now the other shareholders in Fortuna are being asked to
formally merge Kodiak (the ALESSIOs corporation), with Fortuna.
The Fortuna shareholders will be cashed out at $3.60 a share.

Kodiak currently owns 67% of Fortuna, but under a Consent
Order signed by a U. S. District Court Judge in San Diego, only
those shareholders unconnected with Kokiak or the ALESSIO family
were permitted to vote on the merger offer.

Fortuna corporation is publicly owned subject to SEC
regulations, while Kodiak, a private corporation, is not.

Hacienda. These sources report that FRESCH's real name is FRISCHETTI
and that he is an old associate of Chicago LCN hoodium, LEONARD
ROBERT "NEEDLES" GIANOLA (deceased), a Chicago loan shark boss. The
negotiations for the sale of the Hacienda are being handled by FRESCH
along with JOE ALAMA, also known as "Joe the Bubble", whose real
identity is JOSEPH ANTHONY GIRALAMI, FBI Number 119478C, another old
Chicago ‘shylock now working as a "las Vegas businessman".

GLICK will also be called upon to testify before the
bankruptcy court in San Diego in the coming weeks. He will be
questioned regarding compensating financial balances of SDC. It
appears that when GLICK and WITTMAN obtained the $3.75 million dollar
loan from Home Federal, they deposited four million dollars in Home
Federal. These were in the form of Certificates of Deposit (CD).

Two million dollars in CDs came from the Central States Teamster
Pension Fund which had been purchased for the fund by the former fund
director, AL BARON. As soon as the $3.75 million dollar loan came
through from Home, however, the four million dollars in CDs deposited
were drawn out.

III. CHARLES E. LEGGETT

On 11/24/76, LEGGETT was sentenced in State Superior
Court, San Diego, to an interdeterminate 1 to 10 years in State
Prison, in connection with the theft of funds for the purchase of a
La Jolla mansion built by EARL GAGOSIAN.

In a complicated 1973 transaction, LEGGETT posted as
additional security for a loan from Baltimore Federal. Savings and
Loan, $1..75 million dollar phony Certificate of Deposit which he had
been given by the Federal Strike Force in Chicago for use as "flash
money" to investigate the illegal market in stolen securities.

For several years, LEGGETT had been used by the FBI
and Strike Force attorneys in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Las Vegas,
as a high level informant, in security theft cases.’

| ."EEGGETT's attorney, STEPHEN STEIN of Las Vegas,
(formerly a Philadelphia Strike Force attorney who had operated
LEGGETT), claimed in his closing argument that LEGGETT had been
attempting to "make a case" against GAGOSIAN for manipulation of his
RoydlInns. stock.. And that LEGGETT had also been investigating
GAGOSIAN's dealings with San Diego businessman C. ARNHOLT SMITH.

BRIOLA were tied in with -the Smaldone Organized Crime Family in
Denver, and attempted to sell large quartity counterfeit Bank of

II. ALLEN ROBERT. GLICK

This month DENNIS WITTMAN, former president of the
bankrupt Saratoga Development Corporation (SDC), testified before
the Federal Bankruptcy Court. (GLICK, a former partner with WITTMAN,
has taken over SDC and is attempting to reorganize the company under
the bankruptcy laws before it drags GLICK down into financial ruin).
GLICK is especially concerned about the affect of this bankruptcy on
his position in Las Vegas, where he is operating several major
hotels with multi-million dollar Central States Teamster Pension
Fund loans. ‘

WITTMAN was questioned about his $3.75 million dollar
loan from Home Federal Savings and Loan in San Diego as well as his
$1.97 million dollar loan from Allied Bank of Houston. .

The Home Federal loan was given by RICHARD TAYLOR, a
former yice-president and loan officer and a’ personal friend of
WITTMAN who later joined him in SDC.

ANTHONY CANARIS, Assistant Manager of Home Federal's
Main Office, Loan Department, admitted he did not investigate the
financial capability of Saratoga to repay the $3.75 million dollars;
did not get an updated financial statement, or take other usual
financial. cautions, but simply followed the instructions of his
superior, TAYLOR, in putting together the "loan package".

Other litigants in the bankruptcy hearings were Dr.
PHILLIP RAND, and attorney, HENRY GLASSER, executor of the Estate
of Dr. RAND's wife, TAMARA RAND. The RANDs are attempting to
recover $560,000 from Saratoga made for real estate loans. The >
RANDS were limited partners with WITTMAN and GLICK in Saratoga and
now claim they were defrauded out of their. money. (TAMARA RAND ~
after a falling out with GLICK - was found murdered in gangland —
fashion.. The murder was never solved. She had threatened to expose
GLICK's activities).

A highly confidential source reports continued negot-
iations are underway toward the sale of GLICK's Hacienda Hotel-
Casino in Las Vegas. They are being handled by GLICK's business

years, his partners, TOMMY CAMPISE and MIKE DE MASE. DE MASE is
being bankrolled by JOE PAPITTO, a bar owner, who has become wealthy
financing narcotics smuggling. For several years now these
hoodlums have been making their money in pornography, prostitution,
stolen property, and to some extent by narcotics. They now appear

f .to be moying into bookmaking, and are working with TONY BALSAMO.
BALSAMO, for years, has been a prominent downtown bookmaker with
JOHN WILLIAM SPATAFORE, the leading bookmaker in this area.

3. This month, San Diego’ County officials inspected
the Charter Oil Building, one of downtown San Diego's largest
buildings. It has been offered to the county for $4.7 million dollars
as‘an alternative to plans to build a new county office building in
the area. The Charter Oil Building is owned by a partnership made ;
up of MORRIS SHENKER, St. Louis criminal attorney; SIDNEY WYMAN, and
"KEWPIE" RICH, former St. Louis bookies, who are now prominent
operators of the Dunes Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. :

At this time, countyofficials seem to be
disinclined to purchase the building because of the Organized Crime
background of the owners, as well as dissatisfaction with some of
the.office space in the building.

in Las Vegas. (Se eral months ago the informant reported meeting in
SPILOTRO's home, w#th Chicago LCN capo AL PILOTTO and a Chicago labor
consultant, DANXMTLANO. Informant reported at that time that PILOTTO
and MILANO weré in Las Vegas to get a union health insurance contract
signed with e Culinary Union.) The information was given to
Chicago and since that time, the Chicago FBI has been successful in
learning about it.

  
 

a
* These Chicago hoodlums under LCN control have set up
Consultants and Administrators, Inc; Dental and Vision Care Centers,
Inc.; Pinckard Associates; Fortune Services, Inc.; Southeast Florida
Laborers Council District, Miami. They are attempting to control
health and welfare funds in particular unions as well as kickbacks
to union officials and “union consultants".

Using DAN MILANO as one of their fronts, they have set up
Consultants and Administrators, Inc., an Illinois corporation, to
provide dental and vision care. Through their Dental and: Vision
Care Centers, Inc., they are providing similar services in Miami and
are now moving in on Las Vegas.

This activity is under the direct supervision of AL
PILOTTO, a Chicago capo, who reports directly to acting Chicago
LCN boss, JOE AIUPPA, also known as Joey O'Brien.

Consultants and Administrators, Inc., obtains the contract.
Services are handled through Dental and Vision Care Centers, Inc.,
and kickbacks are paid through dummy companies like Pinckard

PODAR and PISANELLO admitted to the informant that two Chicago

mobsters had recently been in Las Vegas exerting pressure on BRAMLET. :
-BRAMLET has now shown up with three busted ribs claiming he got them

by falling off a bar stool. PODAR tried to explained to the informant
that he was not-in a position to force the membership toacept dental
and vision care and that the Chicago hoodlums wanted the union to

set up a dental and eye clinic in Las Vegas, which would be very
expensive. PODAR told the informant that the rank and file would
object to such an expenditure of union funds and that he could not
control it. (All of this information has been furnished to Chicago
and Las Vegas in San Diego airtel to Las Vegas, 11/22/76).
