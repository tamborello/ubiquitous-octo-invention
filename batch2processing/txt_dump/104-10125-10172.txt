DENONSTRATION, WASHINGTON, D. C,
FEBRUARY 5-6, 1968

Father Robert Drinen, Dean, Boston College Law
School, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, stated that the

' yiolence of the war has Silenced the conscience of those

who engage in it and those who are witnesses, He said :
hat if the war could not be won without violating the rules

of warfare, the American people. have the right to know

this and to repudiate the pattern of lawlessness in the

' Vietnam struggle...

Dr, Seymour Melman, Professor of Industrial
Engineerint, Columbia University, New York, New York, and
the Directos of. Research for the book "In The Name of
Anerica," stated that the root principle at stake is
whether American officials must obey the law or whether they
are above the lav. He said that in a free society some may
be guilty, but. all,are responsible. Melman claimed that the

‘recent Viet Cong infiltration ‘into Saigon,,proved that the

people of South Vietnam do not slipport jtheir Governnent.

The opening session ended at approximately 12:30 p.m.

‘and participants were urged to attend "state-by-state"

strategy sessions at various local churches from 1 p.m. until
2:15 p.m. During the afternoon of ¥ebruary 5, 1968,
participants were encouraged to visit their Congressmen for
the purpose of presenting their views on Vietnam.

During the opening session, a group of approxinately

' 100 counterdenonstrators representing the American Council

of Christian Churches, a conservative fundamentalist
organization, conducted a picket line in front of the New York
Avenue Presbyterian Church. These individuals carried —
placards reading, "No Substitute for Victory," "Let's Have
Victory in Vietnam," "Clergymen, Stop Helping the Reds,"

"God and the Devil Do Not Coexist," "Will the Sacrifice of

Gur Boys Be in Vain," and "We Detest War Too, But Tyranny
ore." .

 
 

Reverend Donald A. Waite, who acted aS a spokesme:.
for the American Council of Christian Churches, stated 222%
his group was in Washington, D. C., to demonstrate in favor
of United States policy in Vietnam and in opposition to the
activities of the Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam.
He said his group would peacefully picket all: the activity
of this latter group. :
