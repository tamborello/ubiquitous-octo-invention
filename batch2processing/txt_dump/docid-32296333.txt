; e received information concerning one JOSEPH GAGLIANO
and THOMAS GAGLIANO who had opened a custom jewelry storo:, in
New Orleans. The informant stated that it was his opinion
that the store was a front for some illegitimate enterprise.
He’ advised that the GAGLIANOS were allegedly connected with :
CARLOS MARCELLO and one HENRY ERNST, who was considered to ~
be an accomplished. safe burglar in the southern part of the
country, The records of the NOPD reflect that THOMAS GAGLIANO,
FBI #67129, NOPD #3196, and- JOSEPH GAGLIANO, FBI #786311,
NOPD #3195, were identical with the individuals operating
this store,

Investigation is currently being conducted by

whether VINCENT ALO or THOMAS GAGLIANO was the actual
predecessor of THOMAS LUCHESE,
