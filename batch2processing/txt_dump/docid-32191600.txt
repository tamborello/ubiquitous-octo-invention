ot THOMAS J. HOLT appeared at the office of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), 3801 Biscayne Boulevard,

any information concerning remarks made by one FRANK STURGIS in
his presence concerning the assassination of President JOHN F.

FRANK, STURGIS, but that he met him approximately one year\ago
“at a party given at Fort Lauderdale; Florida. He stated that
he was introduced to STURGIS by a friend of his, BILLY JOHNSON.
HOLT advis that at this party STURGIS had told him that k
had been a Wit man for FIDEL CASTRO, and that both CASTRO and
he (STURGIS) had both worked for the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA).

 

. At this point in the interview, HOLT stated that
ROCKEFELLER, meaning NELSON ROCKEFELLER, had been in charge of
the Warren Commission, and that it had been a cover up as far
as the assassination of KENNEDY was concerned. HOLT next stated
that the "hit" was done in Texas to make it look like JOHNSON
(President LYNDON JOHNSON) was at fault.

HOLT stated that he believed BILLY JOHNSON may have
told STURGIS to say the above things, just to impress HOLT.

HOLT next stated that while at this party, STURGIS
had named many people whom he stated were "big", and that he
knew these people. HOLT stated that he thinks STURGIS may
have killed KENNEDY because STURGIS had said that he could
"shoot a person's brains out at 1,000 yards with a simple
rifle and imagine what I could do with a Scope." HOLT next
stated that if STURGIS had made these comments to him concerning
the assassination of KENNEDY he was sure that he had probably
told them to other people. HOLT stated that STURGIS was a man
approximately 50 years old. HOLT next stated that he advised os
