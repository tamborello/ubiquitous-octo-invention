Since the principal statute involved is under

appear more appropriate that Customs should conduct such
interview at the proper time during the course of their

Miami will continue to maintain close liaison

individuals attempted to sell information to the Guyanese

HART after reportedly having been bilked by HART, and CIA
is of the opinion this information originated with them.

Previous interviews of HOLNESS, as set out in
Miami LHMs of August 27, 1969 and November 7, 1969 under the
HOLNESS caption developed information regarding HART's
attempts to purchase arms in Florida in 1969, These LHMs
