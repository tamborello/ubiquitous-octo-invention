_ BE COMMITTED. ‘HE CLAIMED HIS COMMANDOS ARE CONSTANTLY

- FIGHTING AGAINST CASTRO AND COMMUNISM THROUGH OUT THE

. CARIBBEAN AND WHERE EVER OPPORTUNITIES ARE PRESENTED. BOSCH
CLAIMED HE FIRST RECEIVED NOTICE OF THE MINING BETWEEN
9 AND 14 PM, OCTOBER 11 LAST BY MEANS OF A COMMUNICATION
WHICH HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY, AND THIS ACCOUNTED FOR
HIS BELATED PRESS BELEASE. HE DECLINED TO NAME ANY OF THE
INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE OR TO FURNISH OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION
HE DENIED THAT THIS WAS A FALSE PRESS RELEASE WHICH MIGHT
SERVE TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE MIRR AS A RESULT OF PUBLICITY.

MM 639-S CONTACTED BOSCH ON THE EVENING: OF OCTOBER 11 LAST
AND BOSCH MADE NO MENTION Of CAPTIONED MATTER. 80SCH TOLD
INFORMANT THAT THE TIME WAS NOW PERFECT TO MAKE SOME STRIKE
