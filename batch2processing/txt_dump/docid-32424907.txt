Internal Situation. Your attention ia invited to increased reports,
in CIA's caily anu weckly summaries, of pooular unrest, political strife,
anc economic disruptions inside Cuba. It is suggested that the Special
Croup (Augmented) consider the value of having an SNIE on Cuba :nace
in the immediate future, ae a preliminary to the more conclusive esti-
rate cue at the end of Phase I, Operation Mongoose. Since Phase I
is echeculed to end 31 July, it should prove helpful to have as firma
fix on the Cuban situation as possible, in determining any cesirable
increase or special cffort emphasis in our activities for the last montu
of Phase I. :
