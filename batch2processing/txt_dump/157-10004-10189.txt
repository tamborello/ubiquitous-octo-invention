le Re THE FACE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT ALVARADO IS FABRICATING HIS
STORY OF SEEING OSWALD TAKE MONEY IN THE CUPAN PNRAGSY. IRer Val Eorean

oD W ASSASSIN 1% FRONT OF A NIC INTERLOPER® WE THIN“ IT
POSSIBLE OR EVEN LIKELY THAT NE WAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE CURA
AS ANIC AGENT TRYING TO INFILTEATE CUPA AND WAS PICKED UP THE !
. FACES THERE IN SO DOING. ALL HE EAS SAID STOUT OSHALD: HE COULD HAy
GOTTEN FROM THE NEWSPAPERS, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN INCORRECT ITENS SUCH AS.
HIS STATEMENT THAT OSUALD WORE GLASSES.
| Qe THE FACT THAT ALVARADO IS A CAL, NICE, AND INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN
- DOES NOT MEAN HE IS NOT A FAPRICATOR. FYI WE AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE
BEING FLODDED BY FABRICATIONS ON THE GPFLOOR CASE FROM SEVERAL CONTINENTS
SOME ORIGINATING WITH PEOPLE ON THE FRINGES OF THE INTELLIGENCE BUSINESS.
SUCH FABRICATIONS ARE NOT USUALLY DONE FOR NONEY, BUT OUT OF SICKLY
FANCY AND A DESIRE TO C2T INTO THE INTELLIGENCE GaMEe

3. WE DO NOT THINK IT A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT BOTH DORTICOS AID
ALVARADO TALK ABOUT MONEY PAID TO OSWALD. FOR ONE THING, PAY FOR AN
#SSASSIN IS & FACTOR WHICH IMMEDIATELY RISES IN THE MIND-OF EXPERT a‘D
LAYMEN ALINE. SECONDLY, DORTICOS MAY HAVE HEARD THROUGH SOME RUSST??
os CUBAN SOURCE IN THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT THAT DURAN WAS ASKED VEETHER
THE CUBANS PAID OSWALD FOR THE ALLECED ASSIGNMENT.

4. WHILE WE DO NOT INSIST THAT ALVYARADO'’S STORY IS'REYOND ALL BELIEF
WE DO URCE THAT MEXI PLACE IT ADO UNDER THE MOST SEARCHING
HIS INTERROGATORS © DEEPLY INTO HIS MAKE-UP AN
BACK THROUGH THE THRO -PRECESSES WHICH MAY|HAVE LED Hilt To
MAKE TEIS POSSIELE MIS-STE2. 1% SECURING CONFESSIONS OF FAPRECATION,
