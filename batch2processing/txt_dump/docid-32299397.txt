NY T-3 learned. from individuals close to ;
RAY in Puerto Rico that RAY, has sbeen)travelling regularly :
and has spent extended periods of time throughout the |
Caribbean. NY T-3 said that it is rumored that RAY i
has made a couple of trips inf Cuba but he could not

vouch for the veracity of this rumor .(Z

NY T-3 advised that he had been requested by
the JURE to carry forth a program in universities in the
New York area which would familiarize the college students i
with the program of the JURE. NY T-3 said that it was
most difficult to establish organizations within :
universities within the New York metropolitan area
pecause the students have such a distance to travel. i
and are reluctant to stay after school hours, and !
secondly, so many of the JURE members in New York are
engaged in making a living and have little time to
devote to such a program (2)

NY T-3 stated that the JURE in New York City
ig not activehas no real program or project, is lacking
in leadership and its headquarters at. 104 West 43rd
Street, New York City, has become nothing more than a gathering {
place for members who want to get out of their homes at : (
night (ZL)

 

NY T-3 stated that RAUL CHIBAS, the leader i
of the JURE in New York, has returned to New York from i
Miami, is again teaching school in Long Island, but

has not the drive or leadership to dq anything constructive
for the JURE in the New York area. (t& ;

NY T-4, on October 2, 1964, stated that he
has not received any contact from any JURE members in the
last three months. NY T-4 advised that RAUL CHIBAS,
who was supposed to be in contact with him regarding
the:possibility of purchasing weapons, has not contacted

him although NY T-4 had heard that CHIBAS had recently
returned to New York from Miami. (2)

most inactive during the past few months and he doubted
that there would be any noticeable increase of activity
in the organization within the immediate future.)

departure from Miami, RAY told CHIBAS that he had every
intention of returning to Cuba before the end of 1964,

achieve this or what RAY's plans were but he felt sure that
RAY would make more attempts in the near future. (ZL)
