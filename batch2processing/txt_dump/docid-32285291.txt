that there were three letters from LEE OSWALD which he
had answered. He recalled one dated G/28/63°to ELIZABETH
GURLEY FLYNN and one to himself on 9/1/63. JOHNSON’
indicated tyat re apparently was one sent some time

belief that he sent them to GEORGE MEYERS, because

the OSWALD letters came from an address in New Orleans «)
