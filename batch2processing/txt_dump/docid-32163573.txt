"y am pointing it out in this connection because I

feel sure that further such actions are going to

follow. I remember that, for instance, Treskow told

me who, incidentally, spoke a good German, that Hitler

hed been a great teacher, namely to create unrest &sS

in Czecho-Slovakia, Austria and Poland, to bring about
dissatisfaction. nd that is what we want. A)

"y am taking precautions so that, if events similar
to those that came about in America were to happen
again, I shall be abie to say that I have already
uttered a warning. U) i

"J have also informed my attorney-at-lavw. i wrote

by the same mail to the Chancellery of the Federal
Chancellor, for I regard it as irresponsible to wait .
meekly and inattentively.” u) ;

The | Biv bsequently advised that it had caused a
search to be made of the records of the West German Ministry
of Justice and could locate only two letters written by BUSKE
to that Ministry these being dated September 10, 1963, and
December 12, 1964.. Both contained general statements to the {

effect that BUSKE had valuable

information and requested an

opportunity to present it.

Neither of these letters made any

reference to the assassination of President

MENNEDY in any content Cp |

The Bundeskriminalamt - (BKA - West German Federal
Criminal Police) informed that it had arranged to have BUSKE
interviewed with regard to his alleged information possibly
; bearing on the assassination of President KENNEDY. The BKA
i . furnished a statement dated at Stade, Germany, Suly 31, 1964,
and signed by BUSKE and witnessed by Kriminalkommissar KOLLECKER.

BUSKE has been known to tno [bev well as to other
West German agencies. for a long while. He has been arrested
eleven times in connection with various fraudulent operations
and is presently serving a further sentence of four and one-half
years in the prison at Stade, West Germany.. The data which

to. the fjandesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz - (LEV - State Office
for the Protection of the Constitution), for the State of
Niedersachsenf#na@ was also referred by that agency to the [atv JO
The (BE ound that this information contained no concrete dat .
which would in any way bear on the problem of resolving the
circumstances of the murder of Preside JOEN F, EENNEDY or
the background of that crime. The [BE dded that BUSKE has,
in the past, frequentiy furnished information to various German
agencies and officials which information was regarded as un-
believable and the (ptvIexpressed the opinion that there was a
strong probability that _BUSKE was attempting through these
current reports to the [Bfy, nd the letter to the Department, of_ -
Justice to gain some favorable treatment for himself, The [prvlG)
said that BUSKE's information pertained to alleged operations

. and plans of the East German Intelligence Service which

as unreliable information peddlers.
