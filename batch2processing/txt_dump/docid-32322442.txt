For information of FBIHQ, Indianapolis’ manual indices
searches revealed files/reference(s) which were previously
shipped to FBIHQ, inasmuch as the indices cards were not called
into FBIHQ at the time of the shipping of the files. The
files/reference(s) previously shipped to FBIHQ have been so noted
on the enclosed search slips. FBIHQ is to advise Indianapolis
when/if to ship index cards relating to this matter.

In addition, SAC Wayne R. Alford checked for any old ~
“archived” SAC material that may be stored in the office for

assassination related material as requested by the Board, and no
record was located.
