MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director

VIA: Director
Center for Study of Intelligence

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: Resource Requirements for
‘ Historical Review Group

1. The purpose of this memorandum is to outline the
resources required to enable the Historical Review Group
(HRG) to accelerate the declassification of the microfilmed
Kennedy assassination records. With the additional
resources, we would expect to complete the review of the
microfilm--equivalent to about-150;000 pages--by the end of
this year.

2. Personnel: An additional number of contractors
equivalent to 12 full-time reviewers.

- There are now nine staff reviewers and nine
contractors in HRG. . Six of the staffers are on
rotational assignment until May/June 1994, when they
will be replaced by contractors.

3. Computers: Twelve additional computer terminals
and associated equipment, including a printer, and
enhancements to the present LAN. Estimated cost: $49,000.

4. Other equipment: One high-speed copier. Estimated
cost: $15,000.

5. Space: Acquire an estimated 1,400 square feet to
accommodate additional contractors, equipment, and document
storage space. .Storage shelves for approximately 200
archival boxes are needed. ;

6. There will be a continuing need for the resources
described above even after declassification of the Kennedy
assassination records is completed. The Agency is committed
to releasing to the National Archives substantial
collections of records on topics such as the Bay of Pigs,
the Guatemalan coup, the coup in Iraq, and several other
major covert action programs. We also are committed to

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Administration
Deputy Director for Intelligence
Deputy Director for Operations
Deputy Director for Science and Technology
Chief, DCI/Personnel

FROM: Executive Director

SUBJECT: Request for Assistance/Declassification
of JFK Assassination Records

1. his memorandum requests that addressees identify
staff employees for overtime, after-hours work on Agency
records related to President John F. Kennedy's assassi-
nation. The overtime will be paid by the Center for the
Study of Intelligence. The request. stems from a requirement
in the JFK Assassination Records Act that all relevant
government documents be reviewed for declassification and
transferred to the National Archives by 22 August 1993.

2. Whe specific task for which assistance is needed is
indexing of data into an automated system and ultimately
producing computer-generated forms called “identification
aids." This involves keying in information onto a pre-set.
form that appears on a personal computer screen. (Experi-
ence in indexing or as a document analyst. is necessary.)

The Act cited above requires that each document transferred
to the National Archives have attached to it such an aid.
The same information that is developed in the aids wilI-be

produced on diskettes that will be forwarded to the National
Archives for use in compiling an electronic index.

3. We estimate that it will require up to 20 people
working 10 hours of overtime per week, probably beginning in
early June, to meet our deadline. The work will be done in
the office of the Historical Review Group, in Ames Building.
The preferred hours would be Monday~Friday, 1630-1830, or
1700-1900, and there may be work on Saturday as well.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
FROM: Executive Director

SUBJECT: Completing Work on JFK Assassination Records

1. Your office has asked whether additional resources are
needed to complete work on the JFK records by the deadline
established by Congress of 22 August 1993. Barring the
unforeseen, we should meet the deadline.

2. The Historical Review Group expects to complete review of
all hard copy files (some 250,000 pages) by early June. Since
coordination with the directorates has lagged, we have taken. steps
to increase the number of directorate reviewers. The DO has
approximately doubled the number of reviewers to eight. They are
committed to adding additional resources if required.

3. The second problem is the need to prepare identification
aids for every document transferred to the National Archives. I
have given approval for up to 20 indexers and document analysts to
work overtime on this effort.

4. A potential problem exists in processing a box of
microfilm, which contains the equivalent of some 172,000 pages of
additional material. The Historical Review Group believes a large
part consists of duplicates of material already reviewed. They
should know whether this assumption is correct within the next few
days. In any event, I will assign additional resources if needed.

5. The President has yet to name the Review Board called for
by the JFK Act; therefore, we cannot determine whether the board
will have additional requirements for us.
