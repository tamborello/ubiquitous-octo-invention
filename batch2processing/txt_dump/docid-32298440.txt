JOHN FONTANA!'s function is to organize. numbers, card, dice
and barbout games for. KELLY MANNARINO in New Kensington
and attends the. games. periodically.to make sure that. KELLY
and in turn, SAM. MANNARINO receive their fair share of
‘the percentages. .

T-3 on February. 4,. 1958, described EARL "EARLY" FIELDS
as:the owner and operator of the. Fields Hotel located at
12th and Fourth Avenues in. New Kensington, Pa. . T-3 stated
that FIELDS is reputed.to control the numbers writers

and: control the colored vote in_ the New- Kensington @ area
‘for: the MANNARINO brothers. . .

on January 14, 1958, MIKE ZERVIS, admitted New Kensington
“numbers operator, advised SA JOHN S. -PORTELLA that

within the past: month or two,.he had a.conversation with
KELLY. MANNARINO and KELLY told him that he considered MIKE
HAJADAKOS.as his right arm because HAJADAKOS keeps the
books for the dice games, keeps complete records and
always gives MANNARINO an honest count. ZERVIS further
‘stated that HAJADAKOS has told him that he and JOHNNY
FONTANA receive $125 per week from the MANNARINO operation
plus six per cent ‘commission of the take on. the dice
tables. According to ZERVIS, this percentage. can | sometimes
un, up to $1, 000 per week. - ;

_-ZERVIS: stated that HAJADAKOS has become. a “wealthy man -.
through his. association with the MANNARINOs and-.has made

several trips to his old home town in Peraia, Greece,
‘located:near the Port of Athens, Greece. According to
ZERVIS, HAJADAKOS has. been, using the money to build
apartment buildings and office buildings in this home
town. .He further stated that HAJADAKOS has. told him that
on one particular rental property in Perala, Greece, he
receives $1, 150 a month rent.-

ZERVIS further advised that it ‘is rumored that GABRIEL
MANNARINO is very friendly with AL ROSS of Pittsburgh.
because AL ROSS supposedly served time for a crime KELLY
MANNARINO committed. ZERVIS stated that he would
endeavor to find out more about this rumor but doubted
that he could and said that he, himself, believed that
the rumor had no foundation.

ZERVIS went on to advise about a raid made in New Kensington
by the Internal Revenue Service on January 6, 1958. He
stated that he had a conversation about these raids with
DAN ZELOYLE, Chief.of Police of New Kensington, and ZELOYLE
made the remark that he was sick and tired of being .
embarrassed because of GABRIEL MANNARINO. According to
ZERVIS, ZELOYLE told him that on the day ef the raids, a
member of the Internal Revenue Service came to the New
Kensington Police Station and notified him that a raiding
party was. in New Kensington at that time and that they .
were raiding various clubs in the city... ZELOYLE stated
that the inference he got from this action was that he
could not be trusted and according to ZERVIS, ZELOYLE
disliked this very much. ZERVIS stated however that he
does not believe, ZELOYLE will break ,with the MANNARINOs
over this issue but wished to point out that there appears
to:be some ill feeling beginning to. grow between them.

MIKE ZERVIS further stated that JOHNNY FONTANA can be

found almost any day at the dice tables in New Kensington
where he generally spends most of his day looking out

for the MANNARINOS' interest from about 1:00 in the :
afternoon until closing time. ZERVIS stated that in his
judgment, JOHNNY FONTANA is GABRIEL MANNARINO's most
trusted lieutenant who will someday take GABRIEL MANNARINO's

place.

JOHN FONTANA, 1237 Fifth Avenue, New Kensington, Pa.,

. telephone Edison 9-9563 on January 29,.1958, was interviewed

by SAS RICHARD GORDON DOUCE and NORMAN T. THOMPSON as a
possible witness in connection with a White Slave Traffic
Act investigation pending in the Pittsburgh Office.

FONTANA furnished little or no information of value and at
the outset emphasized that he would not cooperate or assist
the FBI or any;ther law enforcement agency in any matter
under investigation and under no circumstances would he
discuss SAMUEL or GABRIEL MANNARINO whom he indicated he
had known since childhood. .

FONTANA pointed out.that since.being convicted and receiving
a suspended sentence in U. 8. District court, Pittsburgh,
for his part in the vote fraud investigation conducted by
the FBI, he has attempted to go legitimate by working as a
salesman for the Marbet Heating Company of Pittsburgh, Pa.
