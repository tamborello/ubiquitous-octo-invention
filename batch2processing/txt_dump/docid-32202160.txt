were mentioned... All information obtained was delivered to a man
nicknamed Amby who was manager of Ninaros' company Oceanic S.S.
Co. in the East fifties between Park and liadison Avenues in New
York City.

When the Grand Jury was investigating the foreign registration
case they went into this wire-tapping situation closely and in 7
fact contacted some of Maheuts employees. Maheu, I understand,
went to someone in the government and pointed out the situation
vis a vis the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and it was decided not to
proceed further in this matter. It is understood that laheu
spoke to ‘ialter Yagely of the Justice Department in reference to
this and he rushed to the Grand Jury Room and told the Gr rand Jury

to forget this.

where the leader and his party were staying. Maheu used the name of

 
 

Jordan at the Belmont Plaza. “When he received a call from one of |

's secretaries, he would send one of the girls over to the
hotel where was living and she would be secretly passed
into one of the rooms.

The foreign leader's partytravelled across the U.3., stopping at
different cities such as Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco,
etc., and Maheu, alias Jordan followed, staying close by with
the girls. HMaheu used the name Jordan.

Maheu was hired by. the foreign leader's Embassy in Washingtan

through the lawyer. . Maheu did not register as a foreign

6... and secondly, in transferring females across the State
line, he violated the *hite Slave Traffic Act Statute which
forbids transferring women across State lines for immoral pur-
poses. He undoubtedly violated this statute numerous times,
from New York to California and back.

Recently, Drew Pearson has accused the State Department of
' furnishing women for visiting dignatories, and this is a touchy
issue. This whole thing was done with the tacit approval of the

State Department.

In September 1955, a wire tap was placed on the telephone
of one of Onassis! shipping companies, in New York City. Payment
for this was made by Onassis' brother-in-law and rival Ninaros.
at that time great concern existed among official circles in the
_ United States toward the policy of Saudi Arabia in its contemplating
giving to Onassis a monopoly right to carry a majority of the
Saudi Arabian Oil from the latter's ports. WNiharos, of course,
was interested in breaking this threatened monopoly by his greatest
competitor for reasons of business.
Robert M. Maheu,. former FBI agent and then and now a private
investigator, was hired by Niharos to help break this Onassis
® threat. One of the measures used was to get the United States
to put pressure on Saudi Arabia officially and another was to
cause Onassis all the difficulty possiole with the American law.
Maheu made numerous trips to Europe and into Saudi Arabia. In-
dications were that Onassis had bousht off several Saudi jrabia
- governnental officials. . .
CTA, according to Maheu, was interested as were icLeod of
State and the PBI. ‘Haheu allegedly turned over his investigative <
reports to these agencies.

The wire tap in New York therefore was an investigative

 

4

technique. Maheu always said it was quasi governmental in view
of the fact that the U.S. government knew of the tap and gave
an , . BOPERTY OF
tacit approval. . - OFA GE uoner neo
The infor: ation obtained was not startling but nanes of

certain high governmental officials in the Saudi Arabian government

_In June of 1956, a foreign leader ) paid a state
visit to the United States. At that time, the leader was hesitating
between the U.S. and the Sovict Union and was playing the part of
a so-called neutral which, in effect, indicated that he favoured
the Soviet position. The United States at this ‘tine, was goinz
all out to impress the leader.

The foreign leader's Embassy in Washington is represented by a
lawyer . » who, incidentally, had much to do with the
writing of the registration (Foreign Agents Registration act). |

-The lawyer approached someone in the State Jepartment regarding
having women available forthe leadex The leaderwanted a Latin type,

8° American type and a Nordic type woman available when he felt
so inclined. State told the lawyerthat they could not have anything
to do with the obtaining of these women officially, but sussested |
Robert A. Maheu, a former PBT. agent then enzaged in the private —

investigation business in Washington. Maheu was 2 close friend

.

of Scott McLeod, chief of State security and now American Ambassa-
dor to Ireland. It is believed that the lawyer contaced HeLeod
although I have no definite proof of this. -
Maheu agreed to obtain the women for the foreign leader. He contacted
Inspector iobb of the New York P. D. and wanted tobb to arranme
for him and the girls to stay to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, in
_ rooms not too distant from the leader and his party. Robb refused
. involve the police in this affair. OA4a63
Maheu and the prostitutes subsequently stayed at the 3eliaont

Plaza Hotel on Lexington Ave., across from the waldorf Asteria
