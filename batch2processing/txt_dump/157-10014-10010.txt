on either n a we
the Bureau or in possible other testimony, but I would Like
to put them togetner here for the record today.

At any tine while you were -- and again I'm talking from
the period 1958 through May 1965 -- at any time during this
period were you aware of the fact that the CIA was using the
Mafia or underworld figures in attempts to kill Fidel Castro?
, Mr. Wannall. You are going back & long time, but to the
best of my recollection I didn't become aware of that until
after that period, and I think my knowledge was acquired as
a result of reviewing information in our files for the purpose
of reporting material to the Attorney General. A memorandum
was prepared which I think you possibly have access to, and the
date of that memo would probably coincide pretty much with
my knowledge.

Mr, Wallach. <I think the memo you speak about is a March
1967 memorandum which we basically discussed at your office
the day I was there.

Mr. Wannall. That's right.

Mr. Wallach. There were two. One was an internal
memorandum, the other was from the Director to the Attorney
General,

I would like to get to that a little bit hater and get
your knowledge as to what precipitated that and what review

was actually conducted, but I will yet to that matter.

Mr. Wallach. Do you know Vince Nasca?’

Mr. Wannall. Yes. I have known him since about 1951 when
reported to the Division.

Mr. Wallach, what essentially was Mr, ‘Nasca's area of
expertise within the Nationalities Intelligence Section?

Mr. Wannall. Well, he had numerous countries prior to
the Fidel Castro takeover of Cuba, including matters relating
to Cuba. After that, I think he probably devoted quite a

bit of his time principally to the Cuban situation, more

especially the anti-Castro situation in the United States.

Mr. Wallach. One of the documents, as I mentioned to ou

before, that we still have not gotten from the FBI, although th
request has been long outstanding, is a memorandum dated
July 29, 1964, from the SAC in Miami to the Director, and
focusing on the period 1964, do you recall becoming aware that
the CIA was attempting to use a highly placed Cuban to assassi-~
nate Pidel Castro, or had been using, prior to 1964, a highly
placed Cuban to eliminate Fidel Castro whose code name “was
AMLASIL. ‘

Mr. wannall. AMLASH?

Mr. Wallach. AMLASH.-

Mr. Wannall. ‘That code nane does not strike a note wiin
me, and neither does the information that you are ealling te

my attention. Tf don't recall. any information of that nature

Mr. Wallach. Taking a country “that: was,
for example, would you investigate that type of thing for the
Criminal Division?

Mr. Wannall. If it were a Federal violation or a potential

 

Federal violation, that would have been handled under: the

Criminal Division.

Mr. Wallach. So even though the Agent.might have been or
was believed to be involved in a foreign intelligence service,
the Criminal Division --

Mr. Wannall.. The actual assassination would be handled
by the Criminal Division, yes. We would not disregard the
agent. We would continue to follow and report on his- activities
but any investigation of the assassination as such would have
been a criminal violation and under the Division 6, the Genera!
Criminal Division.

Mr. Wallach. ‘In March of 1962 you replaced Sterling
Donahoe as Section Chief of Hationalities Intelligence
Section, is that right?

Mr. Wannall, That is correct,

Mr. Wallach. And you continued in that position at leavi
up until the time of -- through May of 1965.

Mr. Wannall, Yes.

Mr. Wallach. A couple of questions I would Like to asi,

you about. At that time T realize that it may have been tou:

Mr. Wallach. Before we went on the record; you discussed
with us or traced very briefly your positions with the Bureau
since 1968.

Mr. Wannall, 1958.

Mr. Wallach. 1958, I'm sorry. In 1958 you were the
number one man in the Nationalities Intelligence Section, is
that right?

Mr.-Wannall. That's right.

Mr. Wallach. Could you just very succinctly describe
what the function of that section is?

Mr. Wannall. Well, the Nationalities Intelligence
Section was in the counterintelligence Branch of the Division
and handled matters relating to countries other than the
Soviet Union, the Soviet Bloc, Communist China, The matters
were under various statutes, including espionage statutes,
Foreign Agents Registration Act, and related statutes.

Mr. Wallach. If someone, say, if you suspected a

_ Chinese Communist agent or had attempted to or had in fact

killed someone in this country, would that be within your
jurisdiction to investigate? |

Mr. Wannall. A Chinese Communist agent?

Mr. Wallach. Someone you believed to be -- I am being
very theoretical, I agree. I have no specific case in mind.

Mr. Wannall. Of course, China was net always under the
