is very unlikely that BOSCH would disclose such
information to any other source or.informant who might
be developed for this Specific purpose. It is also to
be noted that BOSCH is very ity conscious, which
makes it more difficult ton om to ask specific
questions which might arouse H"S suspicions.

In view of the foregoing; it is requested that
the Bureau reconsider the FD-227's Submitted by this
office.
