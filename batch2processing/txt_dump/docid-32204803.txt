The minutes of the June 18, 1964, meeting (dated June 22, 1964)
contained the following: [OBTAIN COPY] (signed by Peter Jessup)
"A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve
the underworld to assassinate certain Cuban leaders.
Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical of‘ the reported plots and
stated that he would like to go into the matter further.
Others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was
being put on notice and should do everything in its power to
ascertain promptly the veracity of the reports and then under-~
take prevention. It was decided that Mr. Bundy would call the
matter to the Attorney General's attention as a matter of law

enforcement."

 

Mr. McCone's personal memorandum for the record on this .
meeting (dated) June 18, 1964, contains substantially the same
information. [OBTAIN COPY] It refers to a June 10, 1964, CIA
memorandum "reporting plans of Cuban exiles to assassinate
leading Cuban government leaders." This memo apparently had
been sent. to Special Group members and the Attorney General.
[OBTAIN COPY] McCone's memo contains the following:

 

 

 

 

 

"ACTION: Discuss. with General Carter and Mr. Helms steps we
should take to establish the credibility of the report; also
communicate with the FBI through Mr. Papich. Also I should
call the Attorney General personally."

The official minutes of the July 30, 1964, 303 Committee
meeting (dated July 31, 1964) (referred to in 1967 IG report)
. contain no mention of assassination or even of Cuba.
Mr. McCone's personal memorandum (dated July 31, 1964) had .
only the following reference to Cuba: :

"Proposed infiltration/exfiltration operations into Cuba for
August were approved and the July operations were noted."
