d. The "SUMMARY OF CONTENTS" section should
be brief, but also should clearly indicate what is
being provided to the Committee. I wonder, for
instance, whether your sample on the letterhead ;
‘memoranda was issued in widely separated time periods.
The summary as written gives no indication as to
the particular subject of any of the memoranda and the
Single sentence now used to describe all of them covers
the waterfront.

 

e. If the request for information comes officially

from the Committee, the Committee title should be entered

¢ under "REQUESTOR," but if the requestor is an individual
member of the Staff, his name should be indicated.

ft. The last entry in the format, "PROBLEM AREAS,"
has particular significance since it is important to
know if there are Third Agency, or sources and methods,
or other sensitivity problems involved, and this is
the place to identify them. We are beginning to use
the abstracts prepared in our office as an aid to
obtaining release clearance when we are dealing with
the document for which another agency must concur in
the release. The "PROBLEM AREAS" section gives such
other agency an idea as to whether we see any important
reason why they should be concerned about release of —
the document. The entry in this final section of the
format is expected to prove useful for this purpose.

5. One copy of the document or its abstract is all
that is needed by the registry.
