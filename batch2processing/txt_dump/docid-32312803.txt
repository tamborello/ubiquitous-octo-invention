Perhaps though, the hostage situation could be the
avenue which the FBI could utilize in apn effort to identify.
persons being utilized by CIS, such as ms) Presently known cs}
anti-CASTRO groups with their somewhat diminished membership
could be serutinized in an effort to identify persons in
Similar hostage situation. However, care would have to be
exercised in any such inquiry, possibly limiting inquiry to

ery reliable sources within the organization contacted to
avoid exposing the Bureau's interest. Le

Another group offering an avenue of approach to
the problem is the presently arriving Cuban exiles, some of
whom are likely to be suspected CIS agents. The NYO is not
aware of the actual operation vis-a-vis interviews of incoming
refugees, although aware that there is a heavy volume of
traffic probably necessitating cursory interviews upon arrival.
It is not known whether information is solicited regarding
immediate relatives being held as political prisoners in Cuba.
