ADMINIST \TIVE

 

. Regular contacts maintained by the Boston Division
during investigative period of this report with CIs, PCIs and
C-TEs of the Boston Office concerning subjects MANOCCHIO and
VENDITUOLI met with negative results.

 

' It is noted that the investigative period of this
report predates referenced report, and this was necessary

due to the-fact of information being received From an | auxibiany
office after ref Ferenced report. a

 

, By communication dated "/28/71, the New York Office . i
advised as follows:

 

Photographs of both subjects were shown to the |
following informants with negative results: .

.6786-PC : :
4658-PC ; . ;
6319-C :
5908-C

 

 

4/20/71, MY 3104-C-TE advised SA MARTO J. SIMEONE,

after viewing, photographs of both subjects, that thev were

unfamiliar to him: however, due to the fact that both subjects

have friends in the Providence, I. area, the source felt

that should they be anywhere, within the NYC area, they would

probably be in contact with NICK BIANCO (HY file 92-3407), ir

order to “earn their keep.” BIANCO, it is noted, is a close ;
associate of JOSEPH COLUMBO, and the informant stated he would ‘
attempt to determine :if either subject had ever been in contact

with BIANCO in the past. y
