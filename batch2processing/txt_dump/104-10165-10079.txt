Dear Leo: .

lappreciate very much your consideration in sending me a copy
of the Donovan Commission report on the Communict redefection ;
campaign. The subject is a most important one, worthy of the must
careful study, and lam sure that the‘efforts of the International
Rescue Committee will add up to vital contribution toward a solution:
of some of the problems surroundidg it.

As you are aware, a number of agencies, both private and
governmental, are actively working towa.d an improvement in the
elrcumstances in which many escapees iind themseives, As remedial
action is aggressively taken, the difficulties the Communists exploit
will be removed. _ :

Ihave read the reportpersonally, and, ‘at your convenience,
will welcome further discussion of any matters you feel are pertiner:
bat were not covered im thd report itself. | :

Sincerely,
