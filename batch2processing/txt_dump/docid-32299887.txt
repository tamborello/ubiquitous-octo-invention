Informant stated that "CHINK" PACHIANO is a
Capodocine of the GENOVESE Family; however, FACHIANO
is not considered to be active in the Miami area, FACHIANO
commands a high degree of respect, and is answerable only
to PATSY ERRA,

With regard to other persons responsible to

ERRA, informant advised that ROCCO PELLIGRINO is a member
of the GENOVESE Family as is FRANK PELLICCIO, known to
the informant as FRANK HIALEAH, PELLIGRINO is answerable

_ to FRANK HIALEAH, and every Thursday morning without fail,
these two meet between 8:00 and 10:00 AM for the purpose
of discussing the past week's activities. All of this
action, which consists of bookmaking, gambling, shylocking,
narcotics and fencing belongs to ERRA,

ERRA took over all of the late MIKE COPPOLA's
action, and with this inherited JOE MORRISON. MORRISON
has probably the largest bookmaking operation in the
country and operates this out of his residence phone,
utilizing telephone number 866-0161. Informant states
that he handles interstate action and accepts wagers
upwards of $1,000.

ALFRED GEORGE FELICE, known to the informant
as FREDDY FRANCO, is "made" in the LCN, although the

these people are the ones he normally is in contact with.
FELICE is in, poor health; however, he remains active in
the area and isinvolved in sliylocking and narcotics.

SALVATORE CICCONE, known to the informant
as "SAL THE SAILOR" is a highly respected member of the :
