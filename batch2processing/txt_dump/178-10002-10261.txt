This message would seem to indicate that an assassination plan
may have still been in existence in June of 1961, after the
failure at the Bay of Pigs and of the assassination attempt
discussed above. Apparently the agent NOTLOX was not arrested
in April, since he is still sending messages in June.

9. Cable, dated May 3, 1961, to BELL from JMRIMM.
This message transmits another one received from an agent
inside Cuba. The cryptonym of this agent was TEKLOK. The
English translation of the message reads as follows:

"We are contacting all groups (dos) to
organize one united front with a coordina~
tor. You name him or we elect him. Tell
us. Will try kill Fidel today. Andres OK
but still hiding. His men gone to hill.
Want know and what can be used. (as revd)
Luis Jorge."

Note that this is a second agent within Cuba to
transmit a message dealing explicitly with the subject of
‘ assassination.

It should be noted that I did not search the files
of the DDO to locate these documents. Rather they were
searched by DDO employees and these documents were compiled
by these employees and given to me through Joe Seltzer.
Nothing in this package of documents would allow me to deter-
mine the true identities represented by the cryptonyms of the
addressors and addressees of the above messages. Nor is it
possible to identify the agents within Cuba identified by the
above cryptonyms. When I returned these documents to Seltzer,
I requested that he determine the true identities of the
possessors of these cryptonyms and also seek to obtain copies
of any replies the CIA may have sent in response to these
messages coming out of Cuba relating to the assassination of

Fidel.

COMMISSION ON CIA ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES

178-10002-10306
MEMORANDUM
To: File
From: Mason Cargill

Subject: DOCUMENTS FROM DPD FILES RELATED TO
CUBAN OPERATIONS DURING THE PERIOD 1959 ~ 1961

Today, May 21, 1975, Joe Seltzer furnished me a
group of documents, totaling about one-quarter inch in thick-
ness, which were compiled by of the DDO. These
are the documents described in paragraph two of the May 15, —
1975, memorandum from the Agency entitled "AMB Research of DPD
Files. Related to Cuban Operations." Paragraph two of this memo
reads: "A number of documents were found that referred to the
intent on the part of some Cuban teams operating inside Cuba to
attempt to assassinate Castro. . .Also, there is mention of the
air drop of Springfield rifles with telescopic sights."

 

Items of interest in this group of documents
are as follows:

1. Memorandum for the record, unsigned, undated,
Subject: "First Meeting of Branch Four Task Force, 9 March
1960." This memo outlines the meeting of the Branch Four
Group which apparently was to concern itself with covert
operations against Cuba. The memo relates that Colonel King
gave a briefing at this meeting, one aspect.of which was as
follows: "He said that unless Fidel and Raul Castro and "Che"
Guevara could be eliminated in one package--which is highly
unlikely--this operation can be a long, drawn out affair and
the present government will only be overthrown by the use of
force." There are no other references in this memo to elimina-
tion or assassination of Castro. It appears to be a general
discussion of necessary support for covert operations against

Cuba.
