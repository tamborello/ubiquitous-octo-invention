Immediate interview of these persons is not
being requested because it is not considered desirable
at this time to conduct any interviews in this case in
Chicago, Boston or other places in the United States which
might jeopardize the security and/or safety of LA 4448-c-TE
or the security of this investigation by the premature
disclosure of the fact that the Bureau is aware of ROSSELLI's ‘
true name, PHILLIP SACCO. Pl pe are presently pending to
interview TANCREDI | ABIGEEORTORA. in Italy. Both of {
these men are reportedly aw: awed fms ROSSELLT s dual identity.
Subsequent to these interviews, whether or not the TORTORAs
are cooperative, more open investigation will no doubt. be
desirable and it may be possible through appropriate inferences j
to prevent the conclusion being drawn by the person interviewed, |
that the original source of information. concerning ROSSELLI's ‘
true name was LA 4448-C-TE or was from the California area. 1
Every precaution should be taken to protect LA 4448-C-TE
as the informant.

      
  

 

The TORTORA interviews are key interviews and i
should the TORTORAs be cooperative, they will be able to ‘
furnish information of great value to this investigation. i

Subsequent to the interviews of the TORTORAs,
it is suggested that consideration be given to the convening
of a Federal Grand Jury in Boston or Los Angeles or both :
places, to which ROSSELLI's immediate relatives, former
associates and friends who are known to be aware or who
can reasonably be assumed to be aware of his dual identity
could be called. Potential witnesses in this group would
include some high ranking and other members of La Cosa Nostra
throughout the United States. It does not appear that such
witnesses would have a legitimate reason to refuse to testify
on the basis of self-incrimination and such testimony on the
part of La Cosa Nostra members would no doubt be a source
of considerable embarassment to them as members as well as to
the organization.
