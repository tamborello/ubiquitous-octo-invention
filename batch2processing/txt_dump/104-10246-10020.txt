lock would not open for the agent on the afternoon of 6 December. PARMUTH
entered the apartment at 0130 hours on 7 December and unlocked the door. It
was found that the throw bolt located inside the lock was broken. For security

mene -The complete system was then dismantled by SWINEHART so that L-22
Zould re-install the system from the beginning. This was done by L-22 and met
with SWINEHART's satisfaction. Although the Consulate door was closed to the o
public for a period of six days for unknown reasons as of the night of 17 December

1963, tests were made using the SEQUENCE camera photographing people walking
by the Consulate door. The camera worked well and produced good printable
negatives, On the morning of 18 December 1963, L-22 contacted PARMUTH and:
explained that the Consulate door was now open to the public and receiving
.|visitors as of 1010 that day. PARMUTH and SWINEHART joined L-22 shortly
later at the LIERODE basehouse and found that the camera system was working
well and pfiotographing people entering and leaving this target area. SWINEHART
then processed this film at the Station lab and made sample prints of the day's
take to be presented to the COS and C/PBRUMEN for their approval. Both were
very pleased with the photographic results using this type of camera equipment,
at the LIERODE basehouse. As of this reporting, the SEQUENCE camera is
using approximately 100 feet of Plus X film between 0900 and 1400 hours (office
hours for the Consulate). L-23 uses the present dark room area to photograph
traffic entering and leaving the front gate of the Embassy and is on duty. from
0800 to 1800 hours daily, six days a week. In order for L-22 to process the film
from both of these cameras and make prints daily, it will be necessary to install
another darkroom at the basehouse, L-22 will need a Morse Tank for processing
‘film, a drying rack, and a small PAKO dryer for finishing prints in order to
satisfy PBRUMEN requirements at the Station. Forwarded as enclosure 2 is 7
