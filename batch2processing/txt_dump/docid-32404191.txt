Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Release of JFK Assassination Records-—
Differences

REFERENCE: Your Memorandum dated 1 June 1993, Subject:
Release of JFK Assassination Records--Perception
Problem

1. After consulting with key people on the DO team who
are reviewing the JFK records for release, I have learned that
there are some misunderstandings as well as some honest
differences of opinion which are reflected in your Referenced
memo.

2. First, to clear up some points: it was agreed early
on, in July 1992, that old organizational designators, phone and
room numbers would be released. It is entirely possible that
this agreement is not applied uniformally among all the
reviewers. Or that some of the later documents in the 1970's
have more recent data in them. However, I am in agreement that
old office designations above the branch chief level and old
phone and room numbers can be released.

3. I also agree that well-known methods such as
telephone taps and surveillance need not be protected per se. I
understand much is being released about such activities in Mexico
City in the 1963 time period. There are times, however, when
such activity involves liaison equities, and caution would have
to be used to protect liaison's involvement or awareness.

Liaison sensitivity in this regard is universal and never
ceasing.

4. Document and file numbers are problematical. I
understand an early agreement was reached to release Mexico City
and Headquarters numbers, 201 numbers of key players in the JFK
story, as well as old intelligence and DCD reports numbers.

Other cable and dispatch numbers betray station location by their
configuration and abbreviations; indiscriminate release of 201
numbers would be indicative of our operational or counter-
intelligence interests in the persons involved. All of these
details need to be protected.

5. As for inactive cryptonyms, I can only give partial
approval for their release. Where the crypt has been blown or
publically exposed in Congressional hearings, there is no
problem. But many inactive crypts still are using a valid
diagraph and while crypts were designed to protect the real
secrets, they themselves are secrets which must be held. Many of
them interrelate to other projects or activities in a given
location. Inactivity by itself is not enough reason to release
cryptonyms.

6. Source descriptons on disseminated reports, while
often general or sterile, frequently are descriptive enough for
the knowledgeable reader to determine the identity; so purely
benign descriptions such as "untested" or "usually reliable" may
be released, others may not. A disseminated report is still
classified and often the customer is given an accurate, if vague
description in order to establish the credibility of the
information. We cannot’ share such source-identifying
information with the general public.

7. Pseudonyms of former employees cannot be released.
Like cryptonyms, they were designed to protect a secret and have
become secrets themselves. Pseudonyms follow employees through
their careers. If overseas, the number of different names allows
the researcher to determine the size of a station. ‘

8. Lastly, we are all concerned with the credibility
problem--not only for the Agency but also for this project. One
will be able to point critics to the vast amount of information
being released that ordinarily would not be--Mexico City Station
activities including photo ops, phone taps and surveillance
capabilities; considerable file information on Cuban emigres;

contacts su as gnd counterintelligence concerns re

normal practice.

 

  

9. While there will always be those who say we have not
released enough, we must concern ourselves with those who will
think we have released too much--agents, prospects, liaison
services and employees. Accordingly, I must insist on continuing
to protect that which I consider to be Bete to the success
of ongoing and future operational actiy .
