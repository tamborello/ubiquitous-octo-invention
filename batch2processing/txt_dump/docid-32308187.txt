i Irving Davidson called me on the evening of May 25 to adviser
: that he had returned from about 2 weeks in Nicaragua where he had sp Nodh

 

10 or 12 days with President Somoza and General Somoma. They told him
they did not want any part of invasion plans for other countries; that .
they have enough internal problems themselves. They indicated further
that they do not think that neighboring counties will attack Nicaragua

and if there is any attempted invasion of Nicaragua it will be possible

to handle the matter through the Organization of American States (0.

Davidson said that he had been down to Miami again and ta |
jto Tabernilla and Faget and that they are more anxpus than ever to take
‘action against the Castro regime but they want U. S. sanction. Davidson, ; 7
said that Batista is very insecure in the Dominican Republic.

Davidson said that Howard Davis, who had been working with he
afael Del Pino, called him last week and told Davidson he needed 24
90-caliber machine guns, Davidson told him okay, to write him a letter,
and he would contact the Munitions Control for authority and get the
guns. However, Davis did not want any part of this. Davidson thinks
Woward Davis 1s headed for a crack-up. AU

Davidson said that Earl McDonald, in the Security Commission
of the American Legion, had worked with one Pedro Massones of New York
with the idea of setting up a goodwill mission to the Dominican Republic,
He said that McDonald was a close friend of "De
and McDonald had been attempting to arrange for DeLoach to go down to the
Dominican Republic. I told Davidson that he had his wires crossed because
Mr. DeLoach is presently an Assistant Director in the FBI and is certainly
not taking any trip to the Dominican Republic on a goodwill tour.
said that McDonald was worried,over the fact that he had talked up such

a goodwill trip and was concerned about-his discussion with Massones in
this respect. :

i

 

, 1 contacted Mr, DeLoach and he advised that he knew no une by
the name of McDonald in the Security Cotmission of the American Legion nor
does he know any McDonald connected with the American Legion. Mr. DeLoach
has not had any discussions about a trip to the Dominican Republic. This
appears to be something dreamed up by Davidson. me ces sere
