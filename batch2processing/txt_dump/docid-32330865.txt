Mr. ABADIE stated that in the case of PECORA, even
i though he built a much larger and more modern building than
was destroyed in Hurricane Betsy, it would be very difficult
to show an intent: to misuse the proceeds of his loan,
particularly in view of the fact that he is promptly repaying
his loan and that he has 100 percent occupancy on the building
he built with Government funds.

MISCELLANEOUS

Mrs. VERDE CRENSHAW, Passport Office, Department
of State, advised SA KENNETH J HASER on January 16, 1968,
that a search had been made of the files of that office but
no record of a passport application by subject could be
located. :
