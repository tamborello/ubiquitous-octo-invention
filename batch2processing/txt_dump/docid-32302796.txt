Re New York airtel 9/16/64. G)

 

On 10/4 and 10/8/64, CG [5908 S, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, furhished SAs HERBERT K.
STALLINGS and ROBERT R. GLENDON information on a contact with
HOMER BATES CHASE at CHASE's residence in Dorchester, Mass.,
on 10/2-3/68. 69)

During this contact CHASE spoke of his recent trip
to Albania and the fact that he did attend the Albanian
Conference. CHASE stated that he and his wife attended this
conference but did not indicate that any other person from the

U.S. had attended . ((w) A

G) as this was the first meeting between CHASE and
ca §908}s and as this informant was at a disadvantage during j.
his meeting with CHASE since CHASE had brought along five

other individuals for discussion at the meeting, it was
impossible for him to press for details concerning CHASE's
participation in the Albanian Conference. Neither was he so
able to specifically ask if other individuals from the U.S.

had attended this conference.

CG 100-39823

During the meeting with CHASE on 10/2~-3/64, one
PHIL .(LNU), early 50s, and one SUE (LNU), approximately 50
years of age, both white, participated in the discussion.
Informant described SUE as outspoken and as a person holding
CHASE's pro-Chinese views. (Ww

Informant viewed a photograph of subject and stated
that she was not identical to the SUE (LNU) who.attended this
meeting. Informant stated that both PHIL and SUE indicate
during the’ meeting that they were from the Boston area CAH)

As it is entirely possible that there will be
future meetings with CHASE and as it may be possible that
at such future meetings CHASE will voluntarily contribute
details concerning the recent Albanian Conference, this
informant has been cautioned to remain alert to determine .
any information concerning the captioned cub ject C&L)

For New York's ipformation, Boston has been requested
by separate T oneunice tiongeo submit photographs of PHIL and

SUE as it is believed these individuals are active people

in the Boston area Wey w)
