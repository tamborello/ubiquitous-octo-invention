Re Bureau airtel to Albany, 5/7/62, and Dallas
letter to Bureau, 7/10/62.

On 7/12/62, JOSEPH FRANCIS CIVELLO, subject of
Dallas file 92-36 captioned "JOSEPH FRANCIS CIVELLO, aka.
AR", was observed by Bureau Agents at the Egyptian Lounge,
5610 Mockingbird Lane, Dallas. CIVELLO is a known close
associate of the owners of this establishment, JOE and SAM
CAMPISI, CIVELLO was interviewed at this time by the Agents
and appeared to be most cordial and cooperative.

The recent robbery of SAM CAMPISI was discussed
with CIVELLO, and CIVELLO was of the opinion that CAMPISI
had been "set up" by someone close to CAMPISI as the bandits
appeared to have thorough knowledge of CAMPISI's movements
and habits. The Agents intimated to CIVELLO that they had. a
knowledge of the person who had set up CAMPISI, as well as :
the identity of the bandits. CIVELLO appeared to be aston-
ished and also appeared most desirous of asking the Agents
for these identities, but it was noted he could not bring
himself around to this.

The interview was terminated, but it is believed
that possible further contact with CIVELLO may be productive.

On 6/19/62, GEORGE FUQUA, subject of Dallas file
92-61, was arrested in Kansas and subsequently interviewed

  

by Bureau Agent in Kansas. He appeared to be cooperative
and stated he would assist the Bureau in an attempt to
locate Bureau Top Ten Fugitive JOHN GIBSON DILLON. He
also furnished. ,information concerning his knowledge of
