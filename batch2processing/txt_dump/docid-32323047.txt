On 7/8/60, DL-6-S, in person, furnished a hand-
written report to SA W, HARLAN BROWN, dated 7/5/60, which
report has been serialized as 134-1A4-526,

That report stated that BILL LOWERY phoned JOE LANDIN

and asked LANDIN to translate a letter he had received from
DR. GARCIA, written in Spanish. GARCIA in his letter told of
how one VINCENTE TREVING had been shot and killed in an alter~
cation with a policeman, which was unjustified and unnecessary.
GARCIA in this letter identified himself as the State Chairman
of "THE VINCENTE TREVINO MEMORIAL COMMITTEE." He urged the
Chairman of the Dallas Forum to help form a similar committee in
Dallas. GARCIA also stated that it is necessary for all Texas
towns to have these committees for "the price of liberty is
eternal vigilance." In this letter DR, GARCIA outlined some
steps the committee should take. ‘ oe

: That repert also reflected that BILL LOWERY thanked
JOE LANDIN for his help and said he would take the case to the
Forum that night, their regular meeting night. He was thinking
of suggesting a dance, the profit going to the TREVINO family.

Informant had no additional information. \
