MAZLOW helped ROXY's family while ROXY was in jail. He also
said that there were two other men at Apex who have prison rec-
ords.

The person referred to as EDDIE WALKER is believed to
be BRUNO's associate EDWARD WALKER, Business Agent, Philadelphia

dealing with TONY in effort to obtain laundry stops. At this
time WALKER is not known to be connected with any Philadelphia

5'11", 215 pounds, with gray hair and receding hairline, light

olive complexion, facial features - heavy looking, and with
glasses. Informant also advised that prior to this occasion
he never saw TONY but that he believes him to be from Trenton,
N. J., because CHARLES COSTELLO, associate of ANGELO BRUNO,
told informant that he was once in Trenton and TONY told him
the names of the streets that he was driving on. ‘

Ts Yeah.

Bz ROXY ain't going to sell out because Apex is going to
be in business for a long time. That's why I am saying
talk to both of them. Now you take the best deal.

Ts I am going to make him keep getting spots because as
far as that, I can stop those spots overnight.

Bs You can make him keep getting spots, but you want to
know what's the best deal he can give you.

T: Well, ANG, that's what he said he would do.
B: That's the best he can do?
T: Yeah.

B: Well, now, talk to ROXY, Now ROXY don't come to see you.
When you take a few spots off of him, he'll come and see
you.

Ts: He's going to come down to see you or me, either one.

Bs So somebody will come to see you. Now EDDIE WALKER, he
didn't come and see me. But that is the Story with EDDIE
WALKER. Now, what else? Right now over there you were.
