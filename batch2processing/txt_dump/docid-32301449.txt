Investigatyon in this case was conducted
to determine if G OBELLA is a member of "La

A possibility that SOBELLA was a member
of "La Cosa Nostra" was based on informatien furnished
by NY 1894-c, who in January, 1958, advised of the
existence of a criminal conspiracy. In déscribing one
of the "crews" in this conspiracy, which/#AS" located:
on the lower east side of New York City, he mentioned
the name of GUS SOBELLA, among others. GUS SOBELLA,
the informant stated, was part of the original "crew"
formed by the notorious LUCKY LUCIANO. ‘The informant
said that SOBELLA had no particular position although /
he retained a certain amount of respect since he was
close to LUCIANO in the old days.
