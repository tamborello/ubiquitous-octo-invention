NORMAN ROTHMAN

SAC Weeks advised that Rothman
is undoubtedly identical with the Norman
Rothman who has been in the past the
tpmanager of the Sans Souci nightclub and
\j gambling casino in Havana until the latter
part of 1955. Weeks stated that investi-
“gation is continuing to definitely establish
the indicated identity, but in view of the
Norman Rothman connected with the Sans Souci
he feels he is identical with the consicnee.

The Rothman previously connected
with the Sans Souci has furnished information
off and on of a general investigative
intelligence nature to the Legal Attache.
He has a New York City and Miami, Florida,
background although he has spent the

+majority of his time in Havana since 1949.
Earlier, while in New York in the 1930s,
he was @ bookmaker. He subsequently was in
the Army in 1946. He went to Miami where
jhe became interested in gambling in Cuba.

Weeks has advised that investi-
‘gation is continuing end he will keep the
Bureau fully informed,
