“TP 92.1

Cleveland Office ‘has advised that numerous attempts.
‘to contact CARMEN MILANO have.been unsuccessful and that At
appeared unlikely that any interview of MELANO relative to
the activities of TRAFFICANTE would be productive, and that
unless advised to the contrary, MILANO was not: being inter-
viewed. Tampa, however, requested that additional ettorts
to interview MILANO be afforded.

. On June:1, 1967, ‘Set. JACK DE LA LLANO,. Intelligence '
‘Unit, Tampa Police Department’, advised that he had received
information from the Dade County Intelligénce Unit to thé ef- .
fect that the following additional telephqne numbers have .
i.“ been identified as ‘being contained in the:personal papers of
TRAFFICANTE, but was unable to state the scumstances sure
rounding the obtaining of these numbers, jinciuding the date
obtained or the location where the teleph: .@ mumbers had
- been located: ; ‘
