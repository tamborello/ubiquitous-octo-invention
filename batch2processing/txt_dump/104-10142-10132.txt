5. fseeret- PG) LIAISON Received a telephone call from ;
Peter Stockton, on the staff of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power, ™
House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. Mr. Stockton
wished to inquire as to whether we had received and understood a recent
letter on NUMEC from Chairman John D. Dingell (D., Mich.). I told
him that I had and informed him of the arrangements we projected for
briefings. There ensued a long discussion as to Mr. Stockton's
preferences for the mode of briefing, which I informed him I could not
guarantee. It was left that I would check with the appropriate CIA
element, and inform Mr. Stockton of the results when I had them.
