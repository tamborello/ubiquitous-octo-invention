Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
Re: Samuel M. Giancana

of a gangland slaying. Nevertheless, we have a responsi-
bility to alert local authorities to an impending gangland
murder. ())

The informant,[___| has advised our Chicago OTHER 4

Office that he has no intention of going through with any
gangland slaying and he intends to become "ill" so as to
avoid any involvement in this slaying. An illness on the
part of the informant could delay the plans to kill Blasi,
but would not eliminate him entirely from any future
planned slaying of Blasi. Accordingly, it is believed that
if a parole board called him in and questioned him
concerning his activities and associates with the idea of
revocation of parole, if necessary, that his involvement
in this matter would be voluntarily terminated by Giancana
and Buccieri. (Y)

SAC Johnson believes that he can disseminate
this information concerning the planned murder to State's lh
Attorney D: n a confidential basis, thus accomplishing {|
notification to authorities and at the same time arranging
for parole board action against which should serve
to eliminate him from involvemen n s planned killing./¥)

ACTION:

SAC Marlin Johnson is being instructed to furnish
the foregoing to the State's Attorney Dan Ward, Cook Count
on a confidential basis and arrange, if possible, for[
to be called in by his parole_b ith the idea of
revocation of parole today. the informant, is
presently on parole on local bad check charges. He has
previously been involved in a killing while incarcerated
in Tennessee. /v
