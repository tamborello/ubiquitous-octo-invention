Recognizing that these Latin American bases of operation
were important to the MDC, Batista nonetheless preferred to
work out of the Miami area. Its proximity to Cuba, good
facilities for operating boats, and the availability of a large
number of Cubans to serve as mechanics and do other necessary
labor made Miami more desirable thaf the Latin American
facilities. (HSCA Security File 092, Senstudy Document 33, Item

Other than providing the manpower for the training
camp, Batista was not in this episode nor was the
MDC as an organization.

Concurrent with his involvement with leaders of other
exile organizations, Batista was dealing with foreign governments
in an effort to gain. support for his faction of the MDC. After
the World Congress of Christian Democrats in Strasburg, France,
two West German officials of the Christian Democratic Party
conferred with the MDC in Miami. (CIA/DDO, MDC Volume V,
Information cabre(urg-4531, 1/29/64) According to one of the
officials, the West Germans, after months of study, had decided
to help finance the MDC, not because they were particularly fond
of them but felt once Cuba was liberated, the Cubans would have

a moral superiority over the rest of Latin America. ©) a)
