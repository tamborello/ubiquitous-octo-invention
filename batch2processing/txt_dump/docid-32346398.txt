MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

 

VIA: Deputy Director for Operations
SUBJECT: Agency Involvement in the Watergate Case
. REFERENCE: Memorandum of 23 May 1973, Same Subject, from the |

Executive Secretary, CIA Management Committee

e

1. I have known E. Howard Hunt since 1950. We served
together in Mexico City from 1950 to 1953. Both of us were
assigned to Miami in 1960 and 1961. At other times since 1950
we have crossed paths while pursuing our respective CIA careers.

2. The. last time I talked with Howard was during his last
days of work here at Headquarters, as he was processing out.
He told me then that he was retiring and would be working at the
White House. I believe that he described his job there as
"speech writer." To my recollection, the year was 1971. We
have had no contact since that time.

3. Should there nevertheless arise a requirement for a
further discussion of this matter, I.can be reached through the |
office of Mr. Reid Denis, ISD/DIS, Extension 7833. My current
contract with his office runs out on 31 May 1973, but his :
secretary will be able to get in touch with me thereafter.
