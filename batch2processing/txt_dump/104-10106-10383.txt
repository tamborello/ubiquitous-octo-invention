SUBJECT : Official Cever for Mr. 7

 

1. We have been informed by the Clandestine Service
Agent Panel that they pose no objection te the conversion
of Mr°]__—~—s—=édif'rem Staff Agent status to Staff Eaployee
statua which will enable him to work regularly in the
Headquartere building. They do, however, feel that prior
to his conversion a suitable cover, consistent with his
legal background, must be arranged.

2, In informal discussions with your office, a
possibility of arranging non-official cover with a lecal
law firm was discussed. This law firm would ostensibly
have contracts with various government agencies.
urd will be hired by the law firm to serve as a
legal advigor to the government agencies thus enabling
him to be gone from the office a great part of the time.
fn view of his many contacts in government and private
eircles, this type of cover would kold up since some of
hig friends may try to physically reach him at the
office.
