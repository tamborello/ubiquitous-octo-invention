mot to be considered seriously at this time. Also, AMLASH. _
talked ahent his ability to take some men into the hills oe
Of-Lag Villas Province and. taking ‘the smal toms of |
| Trinidad sud Topea de Collaates. He said that he and his
‘wen could last no more than 15 days in the hills as the
_anti-guerrilla fighters naw empieyed by the Regine were

ex~guoriling themselves and knew. the way to fight and.

- Wintin the hills. ‘Algo the Soviet equipment made the govt

_forees much more formidable than in Batista's time. AMLASH

apparently was discussing these ideaa with the impression

that this waa the way to set up 4 provisional rebel govt
and thereby invite and sain US support, By the way A/1
_ talked, it.is iairly certain that AMLASH realized that
. this was not the kind of & plarn which could even renuotely

which - ‘basically boiled down to the fact that AMLASH was.
still not pleased with the support he was getting from the -

USG side... The. visit with DAINOLD, who acted in. the capacity
of a: representative ‘of high levels of the Govt concerned’. -
with the Cuban problem, satisfied AMLASH as far as policyy. mo,
was concerned , but he was not afall happy with the fact  —

‘that he still was not: given the technical assistance for
‘the operational plan as he saw it. A/1 said that AMLASH -
dwelt coustantiy on this point. He could not understand
why he was denied certain ‘small pieces of. equipment which . -

- prottised a final solution to the problem, while, on the _—
other hand, the USG gave much equipment and vioney to exile
groups for their ineffective excursions against Cuban - ~— -
coastal targets, According to A/1, AMLASH fecls strongly: —
