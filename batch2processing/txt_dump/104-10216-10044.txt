1. One of the last of the UNADAGIO tapes, which is transmitted herewith
contained a passace (marked on the attachment) heh remy trea
spotted as possibly referring to Rolando CUBELA (201- our!
transcriber UNOPAL has {insisted that the first name which he heard
was Fernando, feels confident that the conversation is be~

tween a slichtly intoxicated Antonio CARRILLO and CUBELA, with another
perscn pessibly also present. Unfortunately, maddening hammering
noises make any full transcription here impossible. If the tape can
be cleaned up at Headewarters, it may rive additional insights into
CUBELA's current attitudes.

 

  

CARRILLO is the rather thick-tongued individual who is initially heard
making comments which include the illuminating remark ". . . es um
soldado de carajo . . . ." Slirhtly later he appears to say, * estas
equivocado, ah, Rolando." CARRILLO continues after a sudden: abrupt
break fn the shouting at the start of the passape, CUBELA's voice,
which should be identifiable from other informatior available te Head-
quarters, is heard less often than CARRILLO's.

In further support of the thesis that CUBELA is CARRILLO's interlocu~
tor, we note that the conversation takes place about half way through
a reel which began at 1050 and ended at 1645 hours on 17 February.

 

 

 

 

Reference submits evidence that CUBELA vas at the as of
about mid day on 17 february for the purpose of having Lunch with
CAPRILLO.

 

If retranscription of the tape at Headquarters should produce informa-
tion of interest to this station, please send us a copy of the rele~
vant material in Spanish or English.
