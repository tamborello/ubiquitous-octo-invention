Enclosed is a document which we believe has CIA equities. They have been designated by the
ARRB as JFK records. However, we are referring these documents to your office for review,
before we send them to the National Archives and Records Administration for inclusion in the
JFK Collection. The Service has reviewed the documents and annotated comments where
appropriate.

We have told the ARRB that we will hold the entire file, until we receive a response from the
third agency, in this case, the CIA.

Please call me at 435-7006, if there are any questions.
