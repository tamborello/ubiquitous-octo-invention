ADMINISTRATIVE

The investigative period of this report overlaps
investigative period of previous report due to the fact that
WFO was not in receipt of the results of investigation of
auxiliary offices at the time the last report was prepared,

Through established liaison, local law enforcement
@gencies have been made aware of all pertinent facts con-
tained in this report.

It is noted that WFO is coordinating this investi-
gation with its investigation in WFO bombing cases captioned,
"UNSUB; EXPLOSION AT THE SOVIET AIRLINES OFFICE, AEROFLOT,
1101 16TH STREET, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C., 5/10/75" (WFO
174-580), (Bufile 185-517) and "UNSUB; BOMBING OF EMBASSY
OF COSTA RICA, WASHINGTON, D.C., 7/18/75" (185-292) in
view of the similarities of the. three bombings.

Appropriate leads regarding investigation at Miami
set forth in WO report dated 7/28/75,

. Sources who were contacted in the Newark metro-
politan area who are familiar with matters involving the
Cuban community were: X NK\5173-S, NK 5775-PSI, NK 6030-PSI,
NK 2622-S, and [NK (2670fs;

The FBI Laboratory has determined that two
"Engorsele" pocketwatches recovered at the bombing of

the Costa Rican Embassy are identical to the pocketwatches
used at the captioned bombing and at the bombing 6f the
Soviet Airlines Office, Appropriate leads have been sent
to New York to contact U.S, Customs, John F. Kennedy
International Airport and the Mohertus Trading Company,

45 West 38th Street, New York, to determine the importation
and distribution of "Engorsele" watches.
