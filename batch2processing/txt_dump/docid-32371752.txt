4. OPERATIONS

 

a. On 2 August Phineas F, SLINKARD requested PARMUTH to
photograph two BEDOX targets scheduled to meet during the late afternoon
(1830) at a busy corner in Mexico City. PARMUTH used the necktie camera
concealment device for this operation, :

b. On 29 August Lee R. -MYLECHRAINE requested PARMUTH to

- photograph a meeting that was to take place between Simon D. CLACKETT

i and a local travel agent engaged in semi~clandestine booking and travel

arrangements for Central and South American Communists. The meeting

was to take place during the late afternoon on a street corner with sufficient

lighting from store show~case windows to get favorable photographic results.

The meeting was to take place at 1845 hours. At 1830 hours, heavy rains

j aborted all chances of taking a photograph at that location. CLACKETT,

wd realizing the situation, met the target and guided him to the lobby of a movie

theater which was close to the original meeting site. .WhenCLACKETT
‘spotted PARMUTH, he guided the target to an area in the lobby best suited

~ for low light level photography (CLACKETT was trained in photography and
knew well the photographic problem). While talking, he positioned the
target in such.a way so that PARMUTH could get good shots of the meeting.
The box camera concealment device was used on this operation. The Robot
Star camera using a 40.mm lens at F/2 at a speed of 1/30 sec. utilizing
Tri-~X film produced good results,’ Forwarded herewith are the photographs
taken from this operation. This is the first operation in which PARMUTH
used the box camera concealment device.

 

 

5. STATION SUPPORT

a. Onl August PARMUTH, SLINKARD and LIMOPE/1/2 removed
the special 500 mm F/2 lens from the LITABBY basehouse. Little difficulty
was encoutered in taking this lens from the basehouse area. The lens was
taken to PARMUTH's residence and was then transferred to the MKCHARITY
basehouse where it will be held (if KURIOT agrees) for possible future
photographic requirements.

b. On13 August PARMUTH photographed 561 frames, using the
Recordak, to fulfill a monthly Staff D requirement for the COS, Mexico City.

c. On 19 August PARMUTH delivered the LIFIRE/photographic truck
to the MKCHARITY basehouse. The truck will be used to test out E audio
microphones installed at a local hotel.

 

d. On 21 August PARMUTH issued SLINKARD the necktie camera
concealment device and issued to his assistant the box camera concealment
device to cover the same area and targets as reported in 4.a. above.

 

e. On 22 August PARMUTH, using the LIFIRE truck as a mobile
listening post, participated in a test exercise to listen to the installed hidden -
microphones which MULFORD installed at a local hotel.
