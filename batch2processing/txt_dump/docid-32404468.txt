SEC - WORKING PAPER
5 March, 1997

Memorandum For: Chief/HRG

From: Barry HarrelsonZAy

Subject: Name Issue / Status of Review

Reference: Meetings with ARRB staff (Marwell & Gunn)
4 March 1997

Name Issue

I met with Gunn and Marwell (separate meetings) to
discuss the reopening of the names issue per my memo to you.
Both Gunn and Marwell reacted positively. They found the
proposal to be reasonable one and they are willing to work
with us in approaching the Board. However, both said they.
could not predict the Boards reaction. Per Marwell, one
member of the Board (Anna Nelson) seems to believe that if a
person worked for the CIA it should be known.

Apparently our timing is excellent. Marwell is
planning to propose to the Board that they change the
process from the focus on individual postponements to
documents. Under the new approach his staff would have the
authority to negotiate with the Agency on the release of
documents, and only issues/documents of disagreement would
be placed before the Board. Marwell is convinced that even
with an additional year they will not finish the project
with the current approach. He sees our proposal on the
names as an example of how the process would work.

Marwell recommends that we include examples of -
documents containing names of little or no connection to the
story. Bob Skwirot (he was in the meeting with Marwell)
said that there were a number of names that appeared in only
one document and that the number of names had reached 590.
Marwell wants to start immediately on preparing a joint list
of important/releasable individuals.

Action: Advise DO, OGC, upper management of our proposal to
reopen the name issue (how?). Need to decide what level
would sign the memo to the Board, and who would prepare the
memo. If you agree I can send a copy of my memo to you to
Linda and Fred for background use.

HRG and DO team will collect examples of documents and
prepare (with ARRB staff) a list of individuals. The DO
should focus on any person on the list that needs protection
and prepare the evidence ASAP (i.e. not wait for the issue
to be resolved) .

SECRET - WORKING PAPER

New ARRB Review Process

Marwell and I spent some time discussing how a new
process would work. He would like to test the process for
the April meeting. The following is a rough outline with my
comments:

1) HRG reviewers would review the documents the same
as they do now (postponements would be blue highlighted) .
[no change in our procedures]

2) ARRB staff would review the blue highlighted
document .

a) If they agree, they would stamp the document
“ARRB approved” and return it to HRG to process
for NARA.

b) If they disagree they would highlight in
yellow (creating green highlighting). If the two
staffs cannot resolve the issue, then the document
would go before the Board.

[Major change: ARRB staff would no longer record all the
proposed postponements, no DO damage review, no detailed
determination letter requiring HRG reviewers to use the

“grid” to determine what happen.]

3) Non-issue documents would be sent to the ARRB
staff when ready for NARA. At that time the ARRB staff
would prepare a simplified final determination notice and
letter to the Agencies.

[ No action would be required; HRG would file the final
determination notice with the document].

4) “Green” highlighted documents that go to the Board
would be handled the same as today.

[The expectation is that a lot less documents would require
Board action. ]

Comments: With some fine tuning, I think this process could
work, and we would be able to complete the re-review of
documents released in 1993 and 1994 by Oct. 1998.
“non-related” material and the “addition records” are
reviewed by the ARRB staff.

- Completing the entire project will loa on how quickly the

Pending Issues

As part of the change in process, Marwell wants the
Board to focus on outstanding substantive issues as opposed
to micro managing the review. We discussed the following:

1) Nosenko. ARRB staff needs to review the non-related
material and make a recommendation to the Board. Marwell
leans toward not treating all of Nosenko as assassination
related. Could be a hard sell with some Board members.
Should we request that Nosenko meet with the Board? Marwell
thinks they would react favorably.

2) Personnel Files. Again the first step is to have
his staff confirm that only a part of a file is related and
that those documents are in the released material.

3) Gibson. FBI file issue; we need to present case to
the Board

4) LI 9. Continuing to protect will be a hard sell
given that Newman has published identity; we need to present
case to the Board.

5) CRC Financial Files. ARRB staff needs to review

Annual Report and Extension

Marwell ask me to draw you attention to the Annual
Report and the request for an extension. He would still
like a letter from the Agency (could be addressed to him)
along these lines: “reviewed Annual Report”

: “note that the Board has ask for extension”
“support the request/feel it is in interest of
Agency and public /or something along these lines”

Other issues (not discussed with Marwell/Gunn)

Linda (OGC) says CI Staff has ask Gunn to rewrite his
notes, and opposes Gunn's suggestion to release pages from
the CI histories he reviewed. Gunn indicated in his notes
that some of the pages should be released and might be
considered assassination records. We are going to run into
similar problems with the other histories. Gunn will be in
HQ tomorrow to re-do his notes. She will discuss the “pages
issue” with the goal of having him drop the request to
release. As to the question of designating the pages as
assassination records, she will inform him that CI will
oppose. If he insist, she will refer back to HRG.
