organization, are: ,

the American Peace Crusade, and Confidential National Defense Informant
Le A. #3, whose identity is knowm to the Bureau, describes him as follows:

"He is one of the most menacing figures in the

local revolutionary rerks today by reason of his:

smooth manner, his unquestionable brilliance of .

mind, his. quick thinking, his pleasant personality,

anda quality which seems to make him equal to any

exigency. He possesses & pleasing speaking voice, i

and is billed at all of these sffedrs as a motion

picture director.” .
