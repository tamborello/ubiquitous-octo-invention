Barry,

Per our conversation of this morning, and per Tenet’s recent instruction to
search once again for information relevant to JFK’s assassination, I think we need
to call up the entire HYSAGE-1 (Panamanian leading leftist, Thelma KING) file.
According to Jake Esterline, in a phone conversation on the aftemoon of 5
August he (Jake) was debriefing her and the meeting was interrupted by Sammy
BOYD (Panamanian business leader) announcing JFK’s assassination. KING

immediately broke down, began crying and said something to the effect of-they

said they would not do it. Jake tried to obtain more information but KING

 

regained her composure and added nothing more. Jake is convinced that as they
had been talking about Fidel, Che, Raul and PINIERO (head of Cuban
intelligence), KING was referring to them. Further, according to Jake, KING at
one time or another talked of meeting OSWALD, possibly in Cuba or elsewhere.
Jake had reported the above information, but it was very closely held at the time .

so it may not have moved into the JFK material.
