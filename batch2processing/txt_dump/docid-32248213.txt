on a pleasure excursion to Paris from his residence in
New York, Espinosa contacted an old acquaintance, Jose
Trasancos who was at the time working for the Cuban
Consulate in Paris, having been in a position there since
approximately 1962 or 1963.

 

Trasancos spoke of having seen Cubela in Paris and
"something was going on...Rolando (Cubela) is involved with
the CIA and there is something happening." (p. 63) Tras=
ancos wanted Espinosa to get the complete story from
George Robreno, a former member of the Student Revolu-
tionary Movement in Havana, and long-time friend of
Cubela. Robreno at one time had been with the Castro
government as the head of the revolutionary tribunals which
carried out many death sentences. (p. 64) Originally,
Espinosa intended to meet with Robreno in Madrid, but after
encountering difficulties obtaining a visa, was forced at
his own expense to send Robreno an airline ticket for
Paris. (p. 65) ~

In Paris, Robreno told Espinosa that Cubela had been
talking with certain CIA people about an uprising in Cuba
against Castro that was to be led by Cubela and others of-
ficials in the government and the army. Cubela had been in
contact with an individual named Williamson who was the
head of the CIA in Spain. Cubela was most concerned about
Williamson's trustworthiness, expressing as a basis, Wil-
liamson's apparent alcoholism and the fact that he had had
as a mistress a Cuban female who had taken certain important
documents from Williamson's apartment to Castro. Cubela
had wanted his old associate Espinosa to contact his "CIA
colleagues", still believing Espinosa was with the CIA.
Espinosa was to explain Cubela's position to them viz-a-viz
Cubela's contact with Williamson. In addition.to this con-
versation with Robreno, Espinosa met with (Alberto) Blanco,

vm", "El Loco", also involved in the plot with Cubela.: Blanco, en

route to Cuba from Russia via Czechoslovakia, mentioned the

presence of Russian technicians in Cuba, stating that he

wanted the CIA to know that if they were thinking of double-

crossing Cubela, "They (Cubela and his associates in the

' plot) would take care of these Russian technicians". (pp.
67, 68)

It was Espinosa's understanding that Cubela had come
to Madrid sometime earlier to meet with Artime and William-
son. According to Robreno, Artime was soliciting Cubela's
aid in a different coup. Cubela could not trust Artime,
feeling he was working both sides with the CIA and Castro.

: Espinosa returned to New York the week following
his meeting with Robreno in Paris and went directly to

Cavasantos of Immigration and Naturalization to be put in
contact with someone in the CIA. Cavasantos sent Espinosa

to the FBI in New York, where they were joined by someone
from the CIA, whom Espinosa felt was aware of the individuals
mentioned in the AMLASH operation. (pp. 70-72, 76) Espinosa
related Cubela's message and was told he would be contacted
within a few days. (p. 73) After two weeks, Espinosa con-
tacted a friend who worked for Senator Javits-who arranged
for a meeting in Washington with a State Department

official involved with Cuban affairs.

Feeling that he had done all he could do, Espinosa
returned to New York, where he worked for the next two
years before moving to France and Spain. (pp. 77, 78)

Sometime later, Espinosa learned of Cubela's
arrest and imprisonment in Cuba and was most surprised that
Cubela was not executed. (p. 79)

Vv. Individuals of Interest Known to Espinosa

AS Norman Rothman: Espinosa met Rothman in Havana
sometime in the late 1950's, possibly in the casino at the
Hotel Nacional, and later in approximately 1960 or 1961 in
Miami.at the Biltmore Hotel.

Espinosa was a social acquaintance of "Cappy"
Rothman, Norman's son, in Miami from approximately 1960-
1963. (pp. 31, 32, 98-101)

B. Meyer Lansky: While Espinosa did not know
Meyer Lansky, he did see him at the Rivera Casino in .
Havana. (p. 97)

Cc. Raphael Garcia Bongo: Trafficante's attorney.
Espinosa knew Jorta Bongo, the brother of Raphael, and
through him met Raphael. While not first-hand, it was common
knowledge that Raphael was Trafficante's attorney in Cuba.
Approximately five years ago, Espinosa learned that Raphael
had been arrested in Spain for passing counterfeit money.
Espinosa heard that the counterfeit money was linked to
Trafficante. (pp. 103-105)

D. Sam Benton: Knew him through McLaney. Benton
was supplier for the aircraft used on the two aborted oil
refinery raids in 1963. (pp. 18, 19, 23, 93)

 

E. Raul Castro: Espinosa met Raul on two occasions
_in Havana soon after Castro's takeover. Espinosa'was present
in Cubela's hospital room when Raul Castro visited Cubela.
'(p. 55) :

then went into business in Spain and England. He stated he
has had no contact with McLaney since 1965, his last anti-

Castro involvement with McLaney being the aborted July 1963
raid on the oil refineries in Havana. (p. 29)

III. -Espinosa’s Contact With the CIA

During his anti-Batista activity in Cuba from 1954
through 1959, Espinosa was aware that certain persons in his
"group"! had some contact with the American Embassy in Havana,
and that a number of individuals working in Castro's or-
ganization had similar contacts with the CIA. Espinosa had
no contact with the CIA until he reached Miami in 1959 and
joined the Bay of Pigs training force.

 

Espinosa was made aware of training being conducted
to invade Cuba upon his arrival. He left word with friends
to keep him informed and went to New York to work. A short
while later he was contacted, and immediately returned to
enlist. Espinosa was sent to Guatemala in June or July of
1960 to begin the training. (pp. 10, 11)

In Guatemala and later Panama and. New Orleans,
Espinosa was trained in conventional military warfare,
guerrilla warfare, explosives and clandestine operations.

As a result of this training, Espinosa did partici-
pate in various raids into Cuba, some of which were aimed
at the destruction of military targets, others withthe
purpose of gathering information and bringing individuals
out. These activities began before the Bay of Pigs invasion
and. continued through the following summer of 1961. (pp.
14-16) *(It should be noted that Espinosa stated that he
was able to obtain from a friend in the government his file
which details each of these operations and the participants;
however, in our review of files on Espinosa, we find records
showing that Espinosa was terminated from involvement in
March of 1961 and taken off the payroll.)

IV. Espinosa's Involvement With the AMLASH Operation

Espinosa's activities with the CIA ceased as of late
summer 1961. (p. 62) In approximately June of 1965, while

B. 1959-1963

Under the sponsorship of McLaney, Espinosa left Cuba
in 1959 for Miami. While he may have initially stayed at
McLaney's home, he soon began living with his family in
Miami.

It is not known why Espinosa moved to New York in
1960, but his return to Miami later in 1960 was occasioned
by his desire to join his former colleagues in training for
the Bay of Pigs invasion. (pp. 9-12)

Espinosa left the "employ" of the CIA in August of

1961* (See Section III, p. 4); he returned to Miami. In
_ June of 1963 Espinosa was detained by FBI and Customs agents

in Miami for an attempted bombing raid on Cuba. According
to Espinosa, McLaney sponsored Espinosa and a few of his
associates in a plan to bomb the Shell Oil refineries in
Havana. In this group were Sam Benton, Carlos Hernandez
Sanchez, John Koch Gene, Acleo Pedrosa Amores, Miguel Al-
varez and Richard Albert Lauchli. Benton procured an air-
plane, Espinosa the explosives from Lauchli, and McLaney
supplied the financing. (pp. 16-22) An informant within
the group alerted the FBI which was waiting with Customs
officials as the group rendezvoused for the mission. When
this mission failed, another one was immediately put into
operation. The oil refineries were again the targets, but
the plan was to leave from a deserted airstrip in the
vicinity of Lake Ponchartrain, Louisiana, using either a
B-25 or a B-26 bomber, fully operational. Again Espinosa
planned the operation and secured the explosives through
Lauchli. This time, McLaney was to provide the airplane,
and only inform the group of its location once the bombs
were ready for loading. (pp. 23-29, 91,. 92)

 

As was the case for the June 15th mission, this one
was also a failure. One member of the group was recalled
to Miami due to a death in the family, the remaining members,
feeling this would breach their security, disbanded, re-
turning to Miami with Espinosa going to New York to report
to Mike McLaney. On July 31, 1963, the FBI discovered the
cache of explosives to be used on the mission at a farm house
at Lake Ponchartrain owned by Mike McLaney's brother Bill,
and confiscated the entire supply. (pp. 28, 29) :

Espinosa remained in New York until approximately
1967, when he moved to France. He remained there until 1969,

DATE: July 18, 1978

RE: Summary of Victor Espinosa Deposition Taken June 7,
1978 in Washington, D. C.

I. Background: Association with the Revolutionar
Council of the University of Havana, 1954-1959.”
victor Dominador Espinosa Hernandez was born to a
wealthy, landholding family in Cuba. In 1954, he entered
the University of Havana, joining two of his childhood
friends Jose Antonio Echeverria and Rolando Cubela in the |
student political movement. Cubela and Echeverria, some-
what older than Espinosa, were at the time already firmly
established as the leaders of the Revolutionary Council of
the University of Havana, primarily directing their efforts
against the Batista regime. Numerous clashes with the
police and general inattentiveness to studies prompted.
‘Espinosa's father to send Espinosa to Louisiana State
University in Baton Rouge in 1955: (pp. 3-6, 43-47)

When Espinosa became eighteen years of age in ap-
proximately 1956, he left L.S.U. and returned to Cuba to
Manage the ranch-estate left to him by the death of his
grandfather. Upon his return, his political fervor some-
what tempered, Espinosa was content to go about his business,
and spend long weekends in Havana-once a month pursuing less
idealistic endeavors such as gambling and women. (p. 47)
During one of these sojourns in Havana, Espinosa received a
telephone call from Cubela advising him that Echeverria had
just returned from a meeting in Mexico with Castro, and
wanted to assemble the "old" group, as Castro wanted them
to step up their activities against Batista.

As a result of the meeting, action groups were
formed under the direction of Cubela and Echeverria. Each
group consisting of approximately four men was given, the
task of assassinating a designated high ranking official of
the Batista Government. Among the targets were Blanco Irco,

head of military intelligence; Taberinalla, head of the
army; Usalace, chief of police. (pp. 47, 48, 49, 50)

Espinosa's group, with Cubela and Pedro Carbo, was
immediately successful, killing Blanco Irco within the
week of their assignment. Although not suspected at
first, Cubela nevertheless fled to Miami, while Espinosa,
the youngest and least suspect, remained in Cuba. Cubela
eventually returned in 1957, and fought Batista from the
Sierra Maestra Mountains, independently of Castro. (pp. 51, 52)

Thus by late 1957, there were three groups fighting
Batista: Castro's group in Oriente Province, William
Morgan's group and Cubela's group. Castro wanted control
over all the groups, and having Morgan under control, sent
Che Guevara to consolidate the other "fronts". Guevara's
mission was first to assassinate Rolando Menoyo, then Cubéla.
By October of 1958, Guevara had taken Menoyo and Cubela into
custody, but released them after four days. (pp. 54, 55)

: When Batista abdicated in January of 1959, Castro's
group was the only one left intact as the others had been |
decimated by fighting, especially Cubela's after an assault
on the Presidential Palace. As Espinosa described the scene,
"no:one knew what to do; we were fighting a war and the war
was over; we didn;t have any ambition of power. Our aim was
to get the guy (Batista), when these people's (Castro's) aims
were very well planned for far ahead." (p. 56)

Thus by late 1959, with Castro in power, Espinosa,
seeing the student movement ending, left for the United States
and exile, (p. 58) (especially after Espinosa had been ar-
rested by Castro for attempting to smuggle the entire contents
of an army arsenal to Panama and was released only after
Cubela's intervention). (pp. 57-59)

II. Espinosa's Relationship with Mike McLaney
OO a
A. 1954-1959

Espinosa often frequented the gambling casinos in
Havana while a student at the University of Havana. Through
a social friend, FNU Callejas, who was the manager of the
Hotel Nacional, Espinosa was introduced to Bill McLaney,
brother of Mike, and then through Bill;. to *Mike. Their
relationship, according to Espinosa, was purely social during
the remainder of their years in Cuba, not involving any
clandestine activities directed at either Batista or Castro.
Espinosa is not aware of any activities of that nature by
either of the McLaneys during this time, (pp. 9, 10)
