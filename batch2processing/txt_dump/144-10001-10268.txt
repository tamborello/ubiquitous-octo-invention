A M/R: -On 8 November, Mr. Robert G. Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff Director
for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, posed a number of questions to
NSA vegarding a former Air Force enlisted man's allegation that he had intercepted
information linking an assassination plot against President Kennedy with a figure
in organized crime. Mr. Blakey subsequently submitted a written request (dated
15 November) to support his verbal one. : i

In essense, the questions probed NSA's ability to quickly and thoroughly
probe for records from the Air Force site in Kirknewton, Scotland (USA-55,
now closed), for information relating to the allegation.

G809 and N33 personnel reviewed both a listing of data and boxed records :
from USA-55, but their efforts failed to reveal evidence of the alleged incident.

The actual traffic from this period was minimal and no other records are extant.

The Director has approved. (5)(g)(2)(D)
