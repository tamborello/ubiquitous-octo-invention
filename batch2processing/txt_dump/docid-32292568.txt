For further information of the Bureau, Chicago
sources have generally become aware of ALEX's continuing
efforts to lift the Swiss exclusion order against him.
During the course of. a contact with CG 6283-C on other
matters by SA VINCENT L, INSERRA, informant volunteered
the information that it had become common knowledge in
political and hoodlum circles that ALEX is trying desperately
to lift the Swiss exclusion order against him. It is noted
that CG 6283~C is closely associated with First Ward
Democratic politicians who are under the complete domination
of Chicago hoodlums, including GUS ALEX. Informant, in a
completely unsolicited manner, volunteered the information
that he had discreetly determined that no copy of the letter
to the Swiss Government in which Senator DIRKSEN reportedly
intervened on behalf of ALEX, is contained either in the
Chicago office or the Washington, D.C. office of Senator
DIRKSEN. Source advised that this indicates that the
letter in question was apparently sent without the knowledge
of Senator DIRKSEN. The Chicago Office recognizes that one
HAROLD RAINVILLE is the Administrative Assistant of DIRKSEN
and although no information is available that RAINVILLE ‘

. is corrupt, it is generally known that he has a reputation
of peing a political opportunist with political ambi tions of
his own.

 

The Chicago Division is fearful that DIRKSEN's
name may well be included in a list of letter writers and could
unjustifiably embarrass Senator DIRKSEN who has a reputation
for integrity. The Chicago Division feels that it would be
most advisable to save Senator DIRKSEN from embarrassment in
that consideration be given to contacting DIRKSEN so that he
may be made aware of the fact that his name was used in such a
manner. This is merely being submitted as our observations

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach ~
Re: Gus Alex

Chicago has received information concerning this
matter from a confidential informant, CG 6283-C, who claims
to have determined that no copy of the letter to the Swiss
Government is contained either in the Chicago office or the
Washington, D. C., office of the Senator. The informant

| believes this indicates the letter in question was sent
without the knowledge of Senator Dirksen. Although the
responsibility for the letter is not clear, Chicago advises
that the administrative assistant of Dirksen is one Harold

| Rainvitie, who reportedlyhas the reputation of being a
political opportunist with political ambitions.

RECOMMENDATION:

Although the information received from Chicago
informant raises some question as to whether the Alex ;
letter was prepared with the Senator's knowledge, this ; : {
fact is not clear. There is no proof this was more than
a routine communication of the type which might be customarily
handled by administrative assistants or others in a Senator's
office. In view of this, it does not appear:.advisable for
the Bureau to inject itself into this situation involving a
matter of administration within Senator Dirksen's office and,
therefore, it is recommended that no contact be made with
the Senator in connection with this matter. —

Aid,

.As the Bureau is aware, GUS ALEX, a prominent
leader of organized crime Chicago, has been banned from
Switzerland in 1965 for a period of 10 years based primarily
on information disseminated by the FBI. Chicago sources have
reported that GUS ALEX is making every. effort to remove
this exclusion order against him and is calling upon many &
of his political and hoodlum associates to intervene on his
behalf.

As the Bureau is also aware, the Legat in Bern
has advised that letters were sent to the Swiss Government
during July, 1966, from Congressman WILLIAM, L,. DAWSON from
Chicago and U.S. Senator EVERETT MC NE
requesting the Swiss Governmen o reconsider its decision
in this matter. The Swiss Government has indicated that
unless additional derogatory information is received as a
basis to retain the entry ban against ALEX, they will have
alternative but to allow ALEX re-entry.

AR,

Re your airtel 5/5/67,

Consideration has been given to contacting U. S.
Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen for the purpose of furnishing
him background information on the subject and it has been
concluded that it would not appear advisable for the Bureau to
inject itself into this situation which relates to an internal
. matter of the Senator's office, Therefore, no contact is to
‘ be made in this connection, {

Inasmuch as full information has previously been:
furnished to Legat, Bern, relative to Alex, it is not felt
desirable to supply him with the identity of law enforcement
personnel in the Chicago area who may be familiar with Alex's
background for referral to Swiss authorities.

NOTE: Alex was banned as undesirable by the Swiss Government
in 1965 and in connection with his efforts to have the ban
lifted, a letter was received by Swiss authorities from the
office of Senator Dirksen of Illinois. Chicago learned from

- an informant that the letter might have been prepared without
the Senator’s knowledge and recommended in view of this
that contact be made with Senator Dirksen and he be advised
of Alex's background. No contact being made with the Senator's
office inasmuch as there is no substantial evidence the letter con-
cerning Alex was more than a routine communication such as
customarily prepared in a Senator's office by his administrative
staff. Chicago also furnished the names of several law

Re: Gus Alex

NOTE CONTINUED:

enforcement officials in. the Chicago area to be furnished to
Swiss authorities who have indicated that the ban against
Alex may be lifted because of alleged insufficient derogatory
information. Full information on Alex's background has
already been previously’ ‘furnished to Legat and, therefore,

it is not deemed appropréate to provide him with identities
of persons in Chicago™.familiar with Alex's background in
order that this can be turned over to Swiss authorities.

Alex is a notorious member of the Chicago. w ryt |
underworld who has been closely associated with Sam
Giancana and other top ranking members of the Chicago a
criminal organization. In the past, he has made
annual winter vacation trips with his paramour,
Suzanne Fueger, to Europe with visits on each occasion
to Switzerland. .

In 1965 the Swiss Government issued an order
banning him from the country for a period of ten years
based on his background and reputation as a notorious
racketeering figure. Alex engaged legal counsel and
made a strenuous effort to have the ban lifted anda ‘
Swiss official indicated in March, 1967, that there yt
was insufficient evidentiary material on which to cons
tinue the ban against Alex.
