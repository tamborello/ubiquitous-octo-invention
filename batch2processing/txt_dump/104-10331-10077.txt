about her retirement. The bank called Bill back and stated that Ms. Bustos had never heard of the old friend and was not interested. Bill
is now stumped on where to go.

Bill did contact A.W. Herbert. Mr. Herbert said revelation might cause some embarrassment to friends and associates, He will think over
the weekend about operational concerns. Mr. Herbert has relatives in Argentina, and a son who is an investment banker in London.
Further, he is president of two companies, one in Argentina and one in Addis Ababa.

J also spoke with Jeremy Gunn, Acting GC for the Review Board, | advised him that we were considering appealing on two names, but

had asked the D0 to review the evidence of potential harm so we could make an intelligent decision. | asked him to find out whether the
Board would be receptive to a request for reconsideration short of appealing to the President. He thought such an approach wouldbea
good idea, but, obviously, had te talk to the Staff Director and Board Members. He is in New Orleans this week attending Board hearings.
but will be back in town next week.
