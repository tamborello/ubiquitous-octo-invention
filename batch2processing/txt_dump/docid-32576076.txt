Re Phila. airtel to Bureau 8/4/64 and form FD
142 dated 8/4/64. ;
PH 705-C* activated 11:02 a.m., 8/7/64.

on 8/6/64 SAs J. ROBERT PEARCE and JOSEPH A.
VERICA made installation at 1531 S. Broad Street, Phila.,

first floor, under pretext of telephone men. Installation

checked successfully butvtechnical difficulties encounter

in routing to CP over leased line. This situation remedied

8/7/64 and source appears to have excellent quality.

For record purposes, outside coverage during
installation was afforded by SAs DAVID W. BREEN, ROBERT W
HOLMES and EDWARD D. HEGARTY.

There was no breach of security during trespass
and altered telephone "jack" was used in this installatio
which affords excellent security.

Bureau will be kept advised of the developments
of this source.
