' The above report does not provide data not already
known to the Bureau, However, it has been reported to
present the observations of the Italian police regarding
the Italian Mafia and the American criminal element,

HENRY MANFREDI, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, Washington, D,C,, advised on 3~19-69 that he has con-
cluded his talks with Italian police officials regarding its
investigation of the 90 individuals who have been charged
with aggravated criminal conspiracy to import and export
narcotics to and from Italy and with regard to the CARILLO
case,

MANFREDI advised he has suggested to Italian
authorities that they examine records of the SALVATORE CANEBA
trial, which was concluded in 1967, and the records of the
trial held in Reggio Calabria on 10-23-67 against 115 defendants,
all of whom were charged with being members of the Italian
Mafia and with aggravated criminal conspiracy, The Bureau
will recall in that trial on 12-23-68 the court sentenced
73 of the defendants to prison terms ranging from 3 months
to 27 years, Forty of the defendants were acquitted on grounds
of insufficient evidence, According to MANFREDI, the records
of these two trials might assist the Italian police in their
current investigation of the 90 individuals.

MANFREDI said there is no question that the case
against TONY CARILLO is a weak one, He did suggest to the
Italian police that they might wish to issue letters rogatory
so that ET USERPERGARAGO™ an Italian national currently in
jail in Canada, could be questioned regarding any possible ties

“between him and CARILLO,. According to MANFREDI, SARAGO was
one of six Italians arrested in Canada in the latter part of
1967 for ‘bringing narcotics into Canada,

Any pertinent developments in this matter received
by Legat will be reported to the Bureau promptly.

For the Bureau's information, there follows a
translation of a report furnished Legat on 3-19-69 by the \

 

Central Bureau, Criminal Division, Italian National Police, a
Rome, which expresses its observations relating to the ary
Mafia in Italy and its counterpart in the United States:

The ties between the Sicilian Mafia
and its counterpart in the United States were par-
ticularly close during the years following World
War II, The close ties were maintained principally
for the traffic of heroin from Sicily to the United
States.

   
 

The concentrated effort of the Italian
police in cooperation with the FBI and the U, S.
Bureau of Narcotics assisted in disclosing these
ties and stopping the illegal traffic of heroin
to the United States,

Another operation cited is the one con-
ducted by the Squadra Mobile (Flying Squad) of
Palermo, Sicily, in June, 1965, which referred to
the Italian Judiciary a report denouncing members
of the Sicilian Mafia and members of the American
criminal element for aggravated crminal conspiracy,
Penal proceedings in this matter were concluded in
1968, when the court acquitted the defendants for in-
sufficiency of evidence, However, the intervention
in this matter by the Italian police and the numerous
warrants of arrest issued during the police investi-
gation served to impede the efforts of the Mafia in
Sicily.

 

The Italian police have reason to believe
that the Sicilian Mafia has abandoned its drug traffic
with America, This belief is based on the fact that
at the Appalachian Convention of noted criminals in
the United States in 1957, it was suggested that dealing
in drugs be halted. The police have also noted that in
the past several years there has been very little
activity in the trafficking of drugs between the U.S,
and Italy. .

The Italian police are of the opinion, how-
ever, that there still exist some ties between the
Sicilian Mafia and the American criminal element,

Two reasons for this belief are set forth below:

1. It appears that the American criminal element
undertake to protect and conceal the location
of Sicilian Mafiosi in the United States who are
wanted for grave crimes committed in Italy, One
Tats _ cas®yrecalled is that of the dangerous Mafioso
LT! ~~" SANTOY&IBRICI, accused of many grave crimes in
” Ay Italy, oe of which was the killing of a police
a functionary, LIBRICI illegally entered the U.S.
in 1960 under the protection of the Mafia and was
not arrested until August, 1967, in New York, where _ f
he had assumed the identity of FRANCESCDSAGOSTO, LIGA
Cer ae Based on information provided by the Italian police;-*
he was subsequently arrested in the United States
and deported. to Italy, However, many other Sicilian |
Mafiosi sought by Italian justice have found refuge
in the United States under the protection of the
Mafia. ~ ;

There also exist close ties between the American
‘criminal element and dangerous Mafiosi who have been
expelled from the United States and reside in Italy,
The noted American gangster LUCKY LUCIANO died in
Italy in 1961; howev of the-—bosses of the
American Mafia, GIUSEP. DO, also known as Joe
Adonis, has been residi in Italy since 1956, In
regard to ADONIS, it w¥11 be recalled that in
December, 1968, the.-federal Bureau of Investigation

advised the Italian police that a cemmittege of
embers of La Cosa Nostra in the ee

 
  
   
 

which included ANTONIO*CARILLO, THOMA Li, DAVID
PETRILLO, and others, had left’ the United=States

a short time before to go to Italy with the intention

meeting JOE ADONIS. One of” the’ possible reasons
for the/meeting was to discuss a possible successor
to V. NOVESE, who at that time was in very bad
health, Investigation by the Italian National °
Police verified that these individuals had arrived

in Italy but it was not possible to establish whether
they met with ADONIS.

CARILLO, however, was arrested by the Italian
National Police on November 23, 1968, charged with
conspiring to import and export narcotics. He was
subsequently granted provisional liberty; however,
he must report to the Italian police every 15 days.
The charge against CARILLO is still being investi-
gated by an Investigating Magistrate and no decision
has yet been handed down,

The activities of JOE ADONIS are closely followed,
and pertinent information developed relating to
his activities is furnished to American police

_ authorities,

Other members of the American criminal element

of Italian origin suspected of belonging to La Cosa
Nostra in the United States will frequently travel
to Italy with the apparent purpose of touring and
visiting relatives, Because of the prompt notifica-

‘tion by the’American police authorities, their

DoclId:32308966 Page 4

activities are checked and any pertinent information
developed is disseminated to American authorities,
