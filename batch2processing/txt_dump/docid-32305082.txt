; In connection with the influence of-the Calabrese group
headed by. ANTHONY MILANO of Cleveland, CV 3'Ml-c gave the following
as an illustration; He stated that in abou 1955 he backed a
sheriff's cahdidaté in Mansfield, hoping that .if he was elected
he would be able to open a house of prostitution in Mansfield
and within the jurisdiction of the sheriff, The candidate was
elected without any !|support whatsoever of TONY MOLLICA, He
started his house of prostitution, which was a money making
proposition and shortly thereafter MOLLICA approached him and

; told him that people in’ town were talking'and saying that he, !
-, MOLLICA, was responsible for the house being able to operate 7 !

and it was giving him a bad name because "members" are not - an
supposed to engage in prostitution. Informant told MOLLICA that
he had nothing to worry about as he was not involved, and it~ -
then became apparent that MOLLICA was trying to get part of the
operation and profit. MOLLICA then turned to MTKE ROMEO of
Poland, Ohio, brother of PAUL ROMEO of Campbell, who was a friend
of informantis father, and ROMEO called on the informant on
behalf of MOLLICA, ROMEO told informant that he was “out of Line"!
and was giving MOLLICA a bad reputation in that he had moved .
into MOLLICA's territory. ROMEO told cV 344-C to close the house
for a couple of months so that everything would "cooil" down.
Informant refused and told ROMEO he was not out of line and
secured his own "fix" by backing the sheriff in the election

and the sheriff wanted nothing to do with MOLLICA and would Not |
allow him to operate anything. Informant stated he was mad

about this interference and then wrote.a letter to his father

in Buenos Aires and later received an answer to the letter,

With thé answer he was instructed to take the letter to :
PINDELLI's good friend, ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland, and

‘ according to CV 344-c, he did this, A couple of days later
informant was called by "WHITEY" BESASE, who instructed him .
to come to Akron to the home of JAMES LA FATCH for a meeting. a
He was told to come there with MOLLICA, but informant refused ; ;
stating he was not going to be “dumped" en route’ or at the meeting. - |
He then called MILANO in the presence of MOLLICA and told MILANO a
what they wanted. of him. MILANO instructed MOLLICA that he was i
instructing "the kid" (the informant) to accompany him to . ‘
Akeon, and told MOLLICA that if a “hair on the head of PANDELLI"

was harmed he would see that the whole bunch was taken care of. -
Informant then got on thé phone and was instructed by MILANO

to go to Akron with MOLLICA and everything was going to be all

several years ago was a part of the PG group, headed by

The Akron area is part of the Sicilian group nr)
operating in Toledo, Canton, Warren and Youngstown, and
