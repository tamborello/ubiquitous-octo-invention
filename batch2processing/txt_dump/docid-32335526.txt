Bureau of Narcotics and the Dade County
Department of Public Safety. All agencies .
considered PATCH as an unstable, unreliable
and uncontrollable individual, who .
embroiders and distorts the truth. PATCH
has an arrést record.for narcotics
violations, breaking ‘and entering, and”
obstruction of. justice. A.source of. the
North Miami PD advised PATCH at one time
operated a group of teen-aged thievés

and that PATCH would. finger the hit,”

drive the car and fence the stolen goods.

At the time he was interviewed, PATCH -
appeared to be giving greater credence

than justified to the few facts he seemed

to have. He impressed the interviewing
Agents as having § a monetary or self-interest
motive, :

(FNU) VERDEL of. Powde vr springs, Georgia, in all —
probability is identical Ld ith ex Sota eorE gn 82) III,
who resides at Route 1 that. town... WERBELL has been inter=
viewed a number of times by the. Atlanta office, He is described
as an opportunist and @ name dropper. He purports to have
served CIA and other government agencies. He is generally
considered totally unreliable, When last interviewed in April,
1968, he inferred he was doing research in the development of

a weapon for military use that had security clearance from the
Department of Defense. “4 .

MARSHALL BREVETZ (protect), operator of “hee Image” ;
and other “hippie” establishnents in Miami, stated (FNU) HOAX .;
in all probability is a man named OAKS, of whom. he has heard.

He stated he knew one SETH, whom he described as a northerner
‘who visited Miami frequently. He knew of no conspiracy between -
these individuals.

LAWRENCE PATCH, the original complainant, on 6/13/68
advised the information he had furnished concerning the conspiracy:
was hazy to him but if he had mentioned a SETH, he probably
meant SETH SKLAREY, and HOAX could have been PHIL OAKS, whose
whereabouts are unknown to him, PATCH stated he knows nothing
further about these Andividuale and can recall no clear’ detajis
of any conspiracy.
