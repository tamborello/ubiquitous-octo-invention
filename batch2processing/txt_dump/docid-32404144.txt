Central Intelligence Agency

 

Waashingjon. D.C. 20505

30 September, 1992

The Honorable Thomas S. Foley
Speaker of the House of Representatives
Washington, D.c. 20515

Dear Mr. Speaker:

As part of the Historical Review Program and in
anticipation of the passage of the Assassination Materials

. Disclosure Act of 1992, the Central Intelligence Agency
. (CIA) has declassified and is sending records related to the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy to the National
Archives. We have already cleared approximately 35,000
pages of documents for transfer to the Archives. To help us
in this process, we seek the agreement of the House of

Representatives to release CIA records that are part of a

segregated document collection established by agreement
between CIA and the House Select Committee on Assassinations
(HSCA) .

In August 1977, Director of Central Intelligence
Stansfield Turner and the HSCA agreed in a Memorandum of
Understanding to create, upon termination of the HSCA,

a segregated’ and secure collection of all Agency documents
reviewed by the Committee. The documents were to remain
segregated within CIA for 30 years unless the DCI and@ the
House of Representatives agreed to a shorter period of time.
In early 1978, the HSCA and the DCI revised the MOU to
provide that only those documents designated by the
HSCA--not all documents reviewed by the Committee+-would

be placed | in this collection. We established the secure
collection in accordance with the MOU, as modified.

I know that you share with me the commitment to
declassify and publicly disclose as many government docu-
ments as possible related to the assassination of President
Kennedy. The House, by passing the Assassination Materials
Disclosure Act, has also gone on record in supporting the

boon DocId: 32404144 Page 3

The Honorable Thomas S. Foley

release of such documents. Your consent, on behalf .of the
House, to the immediate release of CIA records within the
segregated collection will enable the Agency to make its
records available to the National Archives as expeditiously

as possible.

Sincerely,

 Filcton te

Robert M. Gates
Director of Central Intelligence
