MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. John K. Greaney
Associate General Counsel

 

FROM
A/DO/0
SUBJECT : DriverCase (Mail Intercept) -
. Church Committee Report
REFERENCE : <A. OGC Memo 76-6704, 29 November 1976

B. DOJ Letter, 22 November 1976,
Same Subject

1. The reply from our CI Staff in response to,
your request for a review of the Church Committee ”
report on HTLINGUAL (pp 561-636) is attached. Included ©
in their attachment are copies of several reviews of :
the Senate Select Committee drafts as presented.

: 2. The DOJ asked in Reference B if the facts in.
the proposed stipulation are true. We call your atten-.
tion to the CIA Staff comments that the material is
essentially correct as far as we are concerned, but the
Office of Security as well should comment.

3. With regard to the DOJ's request in their
letter to provide any documents prepared by the CIA or
other Government agencies which show the Church
Committee report is inaccurate on the mail opening
aspects, we call your attention to Pages 3, 4 and 5 of
the CI Staff comments (Review Staff Document 76-0264).
Speaking for the Directorate only, we do not believe
that this is what Justice is seeking. Briefly, it
does not appear that the material in the report is
that seriously flawed. The comment's are addressed to
the Select Committee report with different pagination
than the final version available to us. If you wish
to make this material available to the DOJ in response -
to Reference B, we have no objection, although you may
wish to get the concurrence of the OLC who now is
responsible for this material.
