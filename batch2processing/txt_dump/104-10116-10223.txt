. 1. YNCA is an anti-Communist propaganda organization |
With headquarters in New Orleans, that disseminates Euglish
and Lorceipen Tanguage propaganda tapes and ‘Yilms on a world
wide basis, conducts public forums of an extremist

political nuture, etc. The organizational impetus and funds
uppareutly come .from wealthy New Orleans figures including
Dr. Alton OCHSNER, of the OCHSNER CLINIC, and Willard &.
ROBERTSON, In recent years funds have been supplied by the
SCHICK SAFETY RAZOR COMPANY. An INCA letterhead listing all
the officers and officials has been requested trom JMWAVE,
which has had some casual correspondence with the organizu- ,
tion concerning Miss Juanita CASTRO,

2. There is no indication of any Agency relationship
With INCA prior to January 1965 when INCA sponsored Miss ia
ASTRO's appearance in New Orleans. At that time
vuu functioned as Miss CASTRO's business mauager was
inveived with INCA officials in planning the New Orleans
visit where Miss CASTRO was given an award at a dinner
spunsored vy INCA. The dinner, which was attended by civic
}@ deaders and representatives of all news wedia, took place
suortly uiter Miss CASTRO's defection and there was
cunusiderable interest in her appearance, INCA was particulurly
interested since it had distributed hundreds of English
aud Spanish language tapes containing her stutements when
She was surfaced in Mexico. In October 1966 INCA again
requested that Miss CASTRO appear as a guest speaker in
najox Auerican cities in connection with the release of
vie INCA motion picture production "HITLER IN HAVANA",
PuLlowing various reviews of the film, JMWAVE decided the
jilm would probably becdme controversial and it would be
inudvisable to permit Miss CASTRO to accept tie invitation,
Because of INCA's extremist political orientation, JMWAVE
lias wanted to_avoid any more involvement between Miss CASTRO
2u aud INCA and nin his capucity as business
manager, nas managed to prevent this t4¥There hus been only
one cusuad conrvace® between and Edward BUPLER,
ixccutive Vieu-Président of INCA, Since Miss CasTRO's 1905
New Uiieans trip. This took place recently when BUTLER was
in wc areu promoting the "HITLER' IN HAVANA" film.

 

 

 

S. According to JMWAVE, INCA officials have never
indicuted in any way that they are aware of Agency
of Miss CASTRO or her business agent, and there
