the first part of December, 1957, at which time he was
accompanied by a large plonde named LINDA. T-2 stated T-2

4s well acquainted with most of the prostitutes in the Dallas-
Fort Worth area but had never observed LINDA prior to the
above-described meeting.

On January 9, 1958, a 1952 Pontiac bearing Texas
license MW 8923 was observed at the residence of SANDRA NOBLE,
1618 Exeter Street, Dallas, It was determined this vehicle
was registered to RUBY CORSER, mother of SANDRA NOBLE. On
January 13; 1958, Deputy COX advised that based on his past
dealings with RUBY CORSER, he believed she would assist POPE
in any manner and is most uncooperative with law enforcement
officers. He stated she should definitely be considered as
an associate of POPE.

D, CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES
1. Prostitution

On December 24, 1957, Dallas T.1 advised that T-l
had last heard POPE was in Fort Worth, living with his
prostitute wife PEGGY GAFFORD. $21 was of the opinion that
GAFFORD hustled at the Westbrook Hotel in Fort Worth and was
probably helping support POPE.

On December 20, 1957, Dallas Confidential Informant
7-3, who has furnished reliable information in the past,
advised that T-3 is very closely acquainted with RAMONA PARKER,
the ex-wife of JACK PARKER, cousin of POPE, and a prostitute.
On January 31, 1958, T-3 advised that on January 25, 1958,
Dallas pimp and police character LAWRENCE WILLIAM THRASH, FBI
#2128280, had advised T-3 that RAMONA PARKER and JACK ANDREW
PARKER, along with POPE, were hiding out together from the
police. THRASH indicated to T-3 that he knew POPE’s present
whereabouts. THRASH advised T-3 that RAMONA PARKER, who had
formerly hustled for THRASH, would probably get tired of POPE
and leave him in the very near future.

On February 4, 1958, T=2 advised that sometime in
October of 1957, POPE had taken Dallas prostitute LUCILLE JEAN
FAULK, FBI #3312825, away from her pimp-husband NORMAN W.
"BABE" JONES, FBI #3042754. POPE worked FAULK for a while and
then after giving her a peating, she ran away from him and
