Re Rome letters 11/25/68, and 1/8/68.

Romlet 1/8/68, reported the commencement of the trial
in Reggio Calabria on October 23, 1967, against 115 defendants,
all of whom were charged with being members of the Mafia and
with aggravated criminal conspiracy. On 12/23/68, the court
sentenced 73 of the defendants to prison terms ranging from
three months to 27 years. Forty of the defendants were acquitted :
on the grounds of insufficient evidence. ; Bee
