his promotions, GONZALEZ wanted to know what LANDIN thought of

the fact that JOE MOLINA, ex-GI Forum membor chairman, had been
questioned in regards to LEE OSWALD on the President's death.

attended forum meetings). GONZALEZ thought that BILL LOWERY had”
given MOLINA's name to the FBI together with all of the forun —
members’ names. He said he was going to Washington to see if he:

was on the subversive list. He was pretty sure that he could not

get that information there, LANDIN recalled that GONZALEZ knew.

RUBY and that sometime ago (4 years age) he. (ALBERT GONZALEZ)

“no good." GONZALEZ said he did know RUBY and had recently%spoken

to Mrs. GRANT, his sister at the Vegas Club. He is interested :
in buying the club. ; :

give too much of his time to hin for he is known to twist things :
around and could be a dangerous character, He could be working
for someone at that very moment, that is, as an informer, After
