exiles. BABUN and associates held another meeting with CAMERON on
5'Maych and made the counter-offer of $100,000.00 for AMTUUG-1

and »2,500.00 expenses payable in advance, CAHERON promised to

check with his contacts after returning from a pending trip to

the Caribbean, :

3. On 15 March, CAMERON re-contacted BABUN and associates

Bad the following terns were sere“ CIR HISTORICAL REVIEW PROGRAM
A. AMTHUG-1 - $100,000.00 PFI FACE Ag CANIITI7ED

B, AMLOUT-1 - $20,000.00 : 1998
C. AMQUACK-1 - $20,000.00
D. Expenses $2,500.00 payable in advance,

E, the time Init for the operation would be 9U days
from the date when BABUN cauld verify to the satisfaction of
CAMERON that he had the $100,000.00 at his disposal for the
payment, and

F. the contract would only be honored upon presentation
of evidence that AMTIUG-1, AMLOUT=-1 or AMQUACK-1 died at
the hands of the assassins connected with CAMERON's contacts.
As verification, the contacts of CAMERON would seal a list
of names of persons connected with the operation in PBRUMLN
and upon checking should their names be made known or if
they could verify their connection with the assassination
within reason the money would be paid.

4. GOMEZ contacted Juan "Pepin" BOSCH in early April 1964
and BOSCH agreed to advance the $100,000.00 with the BABUN group
advancing the $2,500.00 expense money, Although GOMEZ had BOSCI's
word that he would provide the money, BABUN became sonmwhat
apprehensive and had AMCANOE-1 contact Julio ECBO Olavarria
(201-215813) in New York on 4 April. LOBO immediately agreed to
the terms providing his name was never involved, Accordingly,
on 25 April, BABUN gave CAMERON the $2,500.00 and CAMERON
advised his group. On 28 April, CAMERON reported that his group
had already called their man in PBRUM?N telling him to proceed
as planned adding that "their other man" would be heading for
PBRUMEN shortly. Their final comment was “we hope to have sone
good news for you between 20 and 25 May." LOBO and AMCANCE-1
plan to fly to Miami on 19 May to arrange the transfer of the
$100,000.00 to a safety deposit box, the keys of which will be

held jointly by CAMERON and a confidant of LOBO.

5. The identities of those persons in the CAMERON group

and how they plan to effect this operation is still unknown,
The BABUN associates are reluctant to make any unnecessary
queries since they have invested but $2,500.00 and it was made
fairly clear b "4 at the beginning that the A

nvolyv RON also revealed during the negotiations that
his contact was a police officer in the St. Louis, Missouri, Vice
Squad who was about to retire from the force and who had numerous
connections in the MAFIA, CAMERON also implied that “the other ma):
in question was in Spain, Because of his position between the St,
Louis contacts and the BABUN group, CAMERON has become somewhat
nervous about the operation but not to the extent that he would
be willing to compromise it to the police. As CAMERON knows, he
could also be indicted for conspiracy and he alse knows that if
there was any treachery on'his part, the BAGUN group would not
hesitate to sink his ship, the M/V CAYMAN HOPE,
