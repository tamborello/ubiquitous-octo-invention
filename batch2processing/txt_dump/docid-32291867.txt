netnorke Netzahualcoyotl 133 in downtown Cuernavaca, This
telephone is still in the house, which is presently un-
occupied, The telephone is in the name of DAWSON BRAY,
However, he reportedly sold the house to some ople named
ALLEN and returned to the United states. Wu)

It was considered that possibly’ an error had been
made in transcribing the telephone number, However, there

are certain circumstances whic ndicate that BRAY may be
of significance in this matter

The records of Mexican Immig: ation indicate that
BRAY has been in business in Mexico for almost ten years
and yet is not listed in the directory of American residents

of Mexico for Mexico City or Cuernavaca, which is considered
unusual, Secondly, it was determined that he also utilizes

CASTILLO as his attorney.( Q Ww

The only reference to BRAY in Mexico City files
was in Los Angeles LHM dated November 25, 1959, entitled
JOHNNY MASCHIO (BuFile 105-74778; Los Angeles File 105-6249),
This related to a film festival in Mexico City in 1958,
Reportedly, DAWSON BRAY of Cuernavaca was connected with this
film festival as a representative of the Mexican film industry
and contacte, CHIO to obtain some representatives from
Hollywood, (gfe :

F Records of Mexican Immigration indicate BRAY was

manager of Relaciones Publicas Intercontinentales, 5.A.,

of Mexico City. The only reference of possible pertinence

in Mexico City files to this organization is a report pre~- :
pared in 1953 that WILLIAM O'DWYER, former Mayor of New @
York City and Ambassador to Mexico, was connected with (Q)

It is noted that CHARLES W, BRAY and HOMER BRAY __
are names associated w}th JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA (BuFile 63-7893;
, Chicago File 62-~6006), Je :

' According to thé records of Mexican Immigration,
BRAY was born on August 14, 1923 in Clovis, New Mexico. His
. birthplace is also listed as Amarillo, Texas, He furnished
- a former address as 2200 Colorado Boulevard, Santa Monica,
5 California. He indicated his mother, Mrs. J. M, HYDEN, resides
at 3004 Hayden, Amarillo, Texgs, His father, HOMER BRAY,
a ; was listed as deceased. (4 A)
