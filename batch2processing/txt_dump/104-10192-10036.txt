I 5 Rafferty hag alleged that Hayes piloted the plane which made

| the air strike over the Niagara sugar mill in northem Pinar

' del Rin Province: ‘on 17 January 1965, Hayes rented an aircraft
in Orlando and flew to Immokaleo, Florida, near Naples, where
| he knows a man who owns a motol close to a landing strip. The
strip is equipped with night-landing lights -but no tower,
‘Thore the plane was refueled and loaded with bombs supplied by

"Mimo," It then took off for Cuba.

‘The. MIRR‘s 12 - 13 Fobruary raid of the Bahia Honda Sugar mill,
-@lgo in’ Pinar del Rio Province, was handled directly betwoen
Hayes and Bosch, .Johnson was eliminated when Hayes reported

' Johnson's fail to turn over all of Hayes‘ fee. for the Niagara
raid. - Hayes wi supposed to receive $600 in advance, $1,000
after tho flight, to be ‘followed by anothor $1,000, Bosch gave
Johnson $700 to cover Hayes and an additional $100 for expenses,

. Of this, Johnson gave Hayes only $360 and kept the rest. When

. | Hayes informod Bosch tht he had only recoived $300, Bosch paid

‘ him $1,000 and arranged for the second flight which took place

‘without Johnson’ s _knowledge.

 

    

 
 
 

To Hayes is divorced ‘from ‘bis firat wife but is in tho process of
re-marrying her. He and his ex-wife are from Brinkley, Arkansas,

Hayes, who has been working as a crop duster for Roddel (fau)
in Arkansas, was recently jailed for using his employer's credit
card, He was later released when he agreed to pay or work off

the debt,

8. A Texan naned Dennis Overstreet, who claims to know Hayes since
childhood, said that Hayes is a: tough customer who would traffic
in.anything. He is a very good pilot and can fly a B-26,

Field Comments:

"Mimo" may be identical with Daniel Orlando Ramirez Denis,
an explosives specialist,

2, This is probably Curl Riddel of Riddel's Flying Service,
