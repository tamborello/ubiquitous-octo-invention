CHARLES WILLIAM BRAY, ET AL.
ITSP; MF; ITAR - EXTORTION
(ACCOUNTING AND FRAUD SECTION)

 

DN 249-C reported today that some four years ago,
he was in frequent contact with FELIX ALDERISIO in Chicago
and at that time ALDERISIO's close associates were OBBIE
FRABOTTA and CHUCKIE ENGLISH who were generally rumored to
be muscle men for ALDERISIO who would ordinarily be called
upon to handle any ‘muscling"” operations for him. Informant
expressed the opinion that if ALDERISIO has any intention of
attempting to do away with EGAN in Denver or elsewhere, it is 4
his belief that FRABOTTA or ENGLISH might be assigned to handle,
the job. :

 

 

  
  
  
   
 
 
  
 

 

If recent investigation of ALDERISIO appears to
substantiate this information, it is suggested that complete
descriptions and photos of FRABOTTA and ENGLISH be forwarded
to Denver immediately together with most recent photo of .
ALDERISIO.
