A SUBIECTE/ Political Situation tn Madrid end Sevilie as it

may affect the visit of Mrs. John F. Kennedy and
Children ;

¢

Gur field representatives in coordination with Ambassador Duke
have forwarded the following comments apropos of your query of

28 March.

"There is no foresesable feature in the current
political situation in either Madrid or Seville whieh
could prove to be a physical threat to Mrs. Kennedy,

She is probably the most popular living American in the
eyes of the Spanish public. The Spanish government will
be most anxious to surround her visit with. favorable
publicity. She will in all probability encounter very
favorable but perhaps overenthusiast4¢ public recéptions
and police protections,

“Despite its unofficial nature, this visit my be
interpreted by those in opposition to the Spanish regine
28 & Meagure of tacit support to the regime ana their
coments to this effect to foreign newsmen aBy result in
unfavorable wire service dispatches. There is a remote
possibility that student or crackpot eleitents may attenpt

to use the presence of Mrs, Kennedy to generate anti-American

attitudes on Vietnam or on the subject of the lost H-Bonb.
Efforts of this type would not be expected 4
support.“ stk
