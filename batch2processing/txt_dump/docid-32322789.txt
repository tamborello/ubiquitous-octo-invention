Re: POSSIBLE ANTI-CASTRO RAID

ZARRAGA said although he had no boats or equipment, he
contacted LOMBERTO DIAZ RODRIGUEZ to obtain a boat for
this group, but DIAZ refused to make a boat available.
ZARRAGA said that it is his understanding that the
leader of the group, MANUEL QUIZA DOCAL, is presently
somewhere in New York City, but ZARRAGA does not know
his address, ; : a

advised he owns a twenty-eight foot cabin cruiser type
_9£ boat. named "Jackson," which is located at a fishing
camp at Key Largo, Florida. He also owns a sixty-two foot
fishing-type boat, which is very strong, seagoing, and has
a Diesel engine; -it is completely outfitted with modern
radio equipment, and can serve as a broadcasting station.
This boat's name is "Cacique,"iIt is located in the Miami
River, and has participated in the past in clandestine

also participated in the April 17, 1961, invasion of Cuba,
and is equipped with tanks capable of carrying 3,000
gallons of gasoline.

 

; DIAZ explained that many Cuban refugees have
visited him in an attempt to obtain use of these two boats
for clandestine missions to Cuba, but he has always denied
use of these boats by independent anti-FIDEL CASTRO organ-
izations in Miami. DIAZ said he has been visited by the  —""’
group of six representatives who were trying to raise money ">
and borrow boats and other equipment for another raid on
aa but he also denied them use of the boats, or any other
aid. ;

. DIAZ said he felt certain the group of six would
hot try to launch another military expedition in the near

transportation facilities. DIAZ stated although there are
JInany groups who would like to launch a military attack against
Cuba, the limiting factor is that there is a limited supply
