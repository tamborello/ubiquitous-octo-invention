had indicated in writing to Chief, CIOPS, that he has no
objection for Mr. Belin to do whatever is desired with
these photographs at this time. It should be noted that
Mr. Fernsterwald in 1971 - 1972 was actually shown, by
. Mr. Houston during a visit to the Agency, two of the

twelve photographs, other than the one already published
in the Warren Commission report. (it is these two.that
he has published in The New York Review of Books article

which Mr. Belin attaches- to his memorandum. }

 

7. %It seems to me that “whoever makes a decision on
whether the entire matter can be fully disclosed at this
time should bear iny mind that a subsidiary decision must
also be made, i.e.,’ whether to crop or otherwise fuzz up
the background of the photographs or, alternatively, to
publish the entire run of. the photographs for the first
time without taking out the background. Obviously, none
of these questions apply to the passage of this material
to Mr. Belin and the Rockefeller Commission itself. TI.

_think they should see the entire documentation as it
stands. Perhaps after that, the question of what could
be discussed and the question of “how?" and "how much?”
could be taken up with Mr. Belin himself. My personal
recommendation is that the more we can say about this ©
matter in a fully open and final manner, the better off
we will be as an Agency. But it is my understanding
that there are still sensitivé aspects deriving from the

fact that the operation which produced the photographs
land as a conséquence

: pitCation create additional problems
at that level in Mexico. Also, it should be noted that
the Ambassador, according to Win Scott's memorandum to
J.C. King on 22 November 1963 (see Item 8 in the backup
documentation), allegedly played a direct role in the’
decision to put the photographs into the hands of the FBI
in Dallas laterally from the Field. As far as I know, ..
there has not been anything published about this aspect —
at any time in the past nor have we had any discussions
with the State Department about that aspect of the matter.
