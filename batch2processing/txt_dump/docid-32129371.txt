The Letterhead Memorandum is classified "Confidential"
because data reported from LA 4107-S, LA 3512S, and LA 2517-S
could reasonably result in identification of confidential
informants of continuing value and compromise the effectiveness
thereof. .

The Los Angeles Office indices reveal no information
identifiable with "Citizens! Committee of Inquiry" or DICK WEST.

For the information of the Bureau and New York and
Dallas Divisions, Los Angeles is continuing to arrange for
tape recordings of the activities scheduled to take place at
the Embassy Auditorium on 3440/64, in accordance with Bureau
instructions set forth in Bureau teletype 2/26/64.
