The FD-302 reflecting interview ANTONIO PEREZ A
CASADA is maintained in File 2-312-202.

Inasmuch as future activities of HEMMING appear
likely to be in connection with the Interpen organization,
the Miami subject file on HEMMING is being placed in a
closed status.

One copy of this report has been designated for
Los Angeles for information, as HEMMING originated in the
Los Angeles area, his family still is there, and he may
logically be expected to return there some time in the future.
