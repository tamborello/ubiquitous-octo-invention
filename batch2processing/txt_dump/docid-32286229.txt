she feft Germany for the United States of North America in
order to live with BRAGA at 1710 West, 77th Street. BRAGA
had told his parents that TIJEKINA was his wife. For this.

_ reason she is known under the name of BRAGA only with the

relatives and friends in Chicago. Nick BRAGA intends to marry
tidgbkiNA after her marriage will perhaps have been dissolved.
Questioned with regard’ to the above-mentioned affair, TIJzkiNa
gave the following information: .

"I have been informed of the contents of the here-present

letter, sent anonymously from Chicago to the Bundeskriminal-
amt. In this letter, the name of Jeannette BRAGA is being =

mentioned. Jeannette BRAGA is my future sister-in-law. She

is now approx. .18 years of age and lives with her parents
in the immediate neighbourhood of the place where Nick BRAGA
wand I are residing. The other names mentioned in the. let-

_ter - Charles #NGLISH and Sam GlaNCANA ~ of Chicago are-un-

known to me. the letter says that Jeanette BRAGA is on
friendly terms with Vaarles #NGLISH. Lhis i would tike to
put into doubt.so far, Jeanette BHAGA has not had any boy
friend. Her parents are very severe towrds her, and she

is, for instance, not allowed to go away by herself in the
evening. I also positively deny having received countér-.
feit money from Chicago. Jeanette BRAGA has written only
ence so far, but she never sent me any dollars, and. Nick
BRAGA dropped me a line shortly befor Christmas 1963 to

the effect that he and June KORSAK known to us had. been... ~

_ visited by the criminal police. The police officers asked .

them what I had taken to Germany. They said that I might
have taken drugs to Germany. Today, I quite understand

_ the reason why the criminal police made enquiries, since

it has been established here that the anonymous letter _

has been written by June KORSAK, whom I knew through Nick
BRAGA'S mother. She’ (Korsak) also lives in our immediate nifegh~
bourhood and alsohear BRAGA's parents. She deals in toi-
lette articles, in other words she is a representative

for EVON-articles. She also is on friendly terms with Nick
BRAGA's parents and also came to see us. When I had decided
to go to Germany, Nick BRAGA's mother spoiled my repu-
tation with KORSAK. Shetold her that I only went to Ger-
many in order to see the child's father. She did not know
thatTIJERINA was the child's father. Nick BRAGA never
mentioned the thing to her and I was not ina position, to —
enlighten her because of Nick BRAGA's lies. BRAGA's parents
do.not know that I am married to TIJERINA. When I left Ameri-
ca, I went to ty toilette articles with KORSAK. I think

that KORSAK has been questioned by the police aga result

of this purchase. I havé learned in a talk witH KORSAK

that she cooperates with the Chicago criminal police. She
advises to have to go. to restaurants by order of the police
in order to find out if prostitutes are staying there and ;
if drugs are being on sale. She then passes her observations
on to. the police. She furthermore stated that she receieved
girls on probation who had been caught violating the law

and were to be placed into homes. I believed everything

she said because she made a good impression upon me

and. I was ina foreign country and did not know KORSAK
really well." .

Since August 1963, the accused ‘TIJERINA has been stay-
ing as a visitor with her mother at Kassel and has so far ’
not taken any definite decision as to whether she will re-
turn to the USA or not. She is still a German national.

In 1958 she came to the notice of our authorities
here because she had violated the traffic law. There are
no further criminal-police informations on this person.

 

The Kassel Public Prosecution do not think necessary
.to ask for more documents. The handwritten and typed do-
cuments seem to prove that dune KORSAK mentioned by you
. May be taken into consideration as the author of the ano-
‘nymous letter. She is however not identical to Jeanette
BRAGA, as has been presumed in the FBI letter from Chi-
cago dated 9 December 1963.

You would ‘oblige me by letting me know in due time
the exact personal data, too.
