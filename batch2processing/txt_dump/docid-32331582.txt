site of the dice game shifted from Ripley, Maryland, to
Washington, D.C., in May, 1963. By letter dated 8/8/63 it
was recommended that office of origin be changed to .
Baltimore inasmuch as investigation at WFO was completed

and Baltimore was in a more bgical position to follow and
report. prosecutive developments in this matter. Investigation
by WFO was not reported at an earlier time inasmuch as the °
bulk of pertinent matter was developed by the Baltimore
Division and in order to avoid duplication of information
which was. subsequently set forth in referenced report.
Baltimore reported developments in connection with

activity in the Ripley, Maryland, phase and developments in
St. Mary's County, Maryland, where subject and the others
were arrested on 6/13/63. Instant report contains
developments in connection with the operation at 1915
Biltmore Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.

Observations made regarding activity at 1915
Biltmore Street were obtained from a lookout located at
1912 Biltmore Street, N.W., during the period 5/10/63 -
5/18/63. In many instances individuals entering the premises
at 1915 Biltmore Street, N.W., were not identified since

trees and hedges in addition to extremely poor lighting
in that area. It had been determined that this facility
was the only one available to WFO at that time which
could have been utilized with a maximum degree of security.

WHITE), JOHN RALPH "BILLY" MITCHELL and GEORGE ROHANNA

On 6/1/63 WF 1418 advised SA BUCKLEY that
NESLINE and associates plan to move the dice game from
Washington, D.C., to St. Mary's County, Maryland, and that
ALLEN FISHER, well known Lexington Park, Maryland, gambler,
was negotiating the proposed site.

On 6/7/63, WF 1108-C advised SA JOHN R. BUCKLEY
that on 6/6/63, dice equipment had been moved from
Washington, D.C., to a shack located directly in the rear
of Sportsman's Restaurant, located Route U.S. 5, just over
the county line in St. Mary's County, Md. Informant
described dice table as a permanent mahogany, Las Vegas
type, approximately 12' by 5', very heavy and costing about —
$2,500.00. He said this table had been used for about
one week in the Amber Club's operation, Washington, D.C.,
1962, and the table was not constructed in a manner that
it can be speedily disassembled.

Informant advised this dice game most likely
would be run by JOHN RALPH MITCHELL, CHARLIE WHITE
(CHARLES. TOURINE) and GEORGE ROHANNA, who during April and
May, 1963, operated the dice game at 1915 Biltmore Street
where NESLINE purposely refrained from participating in that
game. Informant said the group planned to start operations
as soon as the shack was fixed up, probably Saturday,
6/8/63, or Monday, 6/10/63.

Interviews of individuals arrested 6/13/62 who
reside in WFO's area have been completed with exception of
JOHN ERNEST SWEENEY. , -

On 6/18/63 SAs RALPH MARSHALL and RICHARD JOHN
DOWDELL attempted to contact SWEENH’ at the address which he
gave to Maryland authorities, 3337 C Street, S.E.,
Washington, D.C. Agents determined that there is no such
address. Subsequent efforts were made by SAs BUCKLEY
and JOHN B. CUSKELLY to interview SWEENEY in the vicinity of
the Round Table Club, 923 llth Street, N.W., on 7/3/63 and
8/7/63. Information has been developed that SWEENEY spent
considerable time at’ the Round Table Club, however, he was
not observed in that area on these days.

On 7/30/63 PCI[L_____——s—~—~C‘ J ndViSe@d SAA J. PATRICK
PARKER that on 6/8/63, a Saturday night, he was at DON
OWEN's 301 Club. He was approached by an individual,
whose photograph he identified as ROBERT JOHN RUGGIERI,
who told him that there was a crap game at the
Sportsman's Club. RUGGIERI did not say whose game this was
but he did mention that GEORGE RAFT was to be there on
this night, June 8, 1963. He stated that RUGGIERI commented
that RAFT would stop at the 301 Club and then he would be
driven to the crap game by “one of their cars."

He went to the Sportsman's Club with RUGGIERI
and spent about an hour there. When he arrived there were
only a few veople there, including SPORTY MARTIN, JOE
NESLINE, JOE GORDON, and JOHN MORISI. He stated while he
was there a moving van arrived and a crap table was
unloaded and set up.

He advised that he was not told whose game this
was but it was obvious to him after only a few minutes in
the Sportsman that it was NESLINE's game. Before he
departed GEORGE RAFT arrived with two young girls both
of whom were wearing white dresses.
