4d, AVDEFTH: The ability to monitor ALBOOR through this
technical operation wus a key factor in deciding to bring him
under closer focus, it should be,able to provide the necessary
depth to any human assessment of the target and it gives us the
Singular opportunity to “observe AEBOUR when he is relaxed at
home and not exhibiting the official mannurisns and personality
which he must display in public and around his other Soviet
colleugues, If we are abla to expand the burgooning Staffer
Contact with Subject as well as place access agents in touch
with him, then his reactions to these contacts can be monitored
and our moves against him tailored accordingly,

 

. 5S. As part of the total offort to build up a large amount of
information on the selected Largete we are including as an attachnont,
&@ copy of the new Personality Characteristic questionnaire (PCQ) with
instructions for its use. lily employing it in conjunction with your
direct assessment of ALBOOR, we should be able to slowly build up
onough information on him so that the indirect psychological assesse
mont techniqucan also be applied. The PCQ is oa now form and less
time-consuming than others but we believe it should be an intepral part
of the entire assessment process focused on a target Soviet and that
it can be an invaluable aid in attempting te evaluate the varied
impressions of the target which have been obtained from aultiple
. B¢cess te him. An initial review of the PCQ may give the impression
that aeny of the questions are irrelevant and have no bearing on the
determination of a persons susceptibility to manipulation, The
questionnaire should not be perused piecemeal, however, but taken in
its entirety since each portion will be interpreted and weighted by
fhe indirect. psychological agseusment techniques until a very complete
dupreasion of. the total personality omerges. We oncourazo the Station
to wcikise the PCQ and when sufficiently complete, forward it te
Headquarters for evaluation. :

. & Once agein, we wish to emphasize that Meadquarters ig ia e .|..
position to offer guidance and support to your efforts, but the.
froetion.of the case rests with the Station, The case officer
fuvelved fis in the best spot to fudge the progress of the case and
make decisions aceerdingly, lor this reason, we encourage a continue
ous end candid dlalogue, concerning the various aspects of your
‘operations against the selected Soviet targets in order to insure
pretsasienal develepaent of each case, If our choles of AKBOOR is
a¢ ‘wardance with your onetheespot assessment of the priority Soviets,
then ‘we would appreciate your appraiaal of hia ae well as any

Reforonce: CSW 7866, 11 February 1909

1, With the departure of ALBOUR and his wife
wo would like to offer a fow comments about him for possible future
action by the Stetion when he returns, The impetus for these
thoughts was a recent examination of the files of atl those Soviets
on the priority target #4st to determine if, perhaps, one of them
offers more of a potential for intensive developwent tnan another,
Tho purpose of this review waa not to discard tho agreodeupon targot
Jist, since this list is the rationale behind the entire concept
of selective targotting; but rather, to attempt a nacrewiny of the
Statlon's focus en tae one particular Sovies who appears tu be the
best selection for operational developmene among the prtority groupe
We have looked of such factors o8 susceptibilities (known or
potential) contacts, accessibility, etc. and, tor reasons discussed
balow, fool that ALBOOR may be the best selection for a dutermined
Station effort mined ot his eventual rocruitmont, Thus, the Station's
focus on the other priority Soviets would continue at its present
level but at tho same time, ALBOUR would be placed “under the
microscone” as the object of a more intensive Station offort aimed
at gaining multiple accoss to him,

B, With tho deminont departure of BIBANDIT/ZZ

and tha resulting elimination of our one yond contact with
t THER, tho choice of ALHOOR bacame easior to make, ils selection,
hewsvor, wes based om several considerstions which, from our
vantage point, seem to offer the beat potential fur Station action

 

when he returns to the country.

@. Accoastbiiitys AHBOOR is ene of the very few Sovfets
with whom direct Staffer contact hes bean mado. Tho social
evening sponte with him and his wife jn January showod ezcellunt

renise because 4¢ appeared that foundations for rapport and
ether contact had been laid. We note, ivwaver, that there

Again and instigate a second mecting soon after Subject
returns from home isave. Since there are no other access

- @yeats mow an vouch with Subject, the potential for assegge
ment of our target personality by dircct Staffer contact
becomes crucial in the selective targotting procedure,
Through the advantages of direct asscssment, wo should be

-able to mika a good judgment concerning the suscep ibilities
(or lack thereof) of ALKOUR and accordingly, determine the —
valuc in pursuing him as a priority target.

 

      
    
   

b, The impressions of AHBOOR and his wife from the one
meeting thusfar seen to offer some possible avenues of approach
which the Station may wish to consider in their plunning, The
wife, in particular, was described as being more relaxed than
AuBOOR and through her professed interest in theatre, music,

and ballet, it might be possible for Nina T, MARGANDE to
exploit this interest and invite her to selected cultural
events, If ALBOUR does not share his wite’s proclivities
for the “arts", then she might appreciate the presence of a
female comranion who shares her Titerents. AbBOUR'S wife
&@lso claimed ic like both Americen songs and dancing. This
too, might. open the door to some form of imaginative approach
buile around a future invitation whereby the incipient social
Felationship of 9 January would be further developed in the
depth needed for a thorough assessment of the target. Cultie
vation of the wife appears to be particularly appropriate
because of the apparent conflicts and tensions between her
and her husband. The sccounts of this relationship from thar
Rrevious tour in Mexico and olso the current transcripts from
NYARD pairta picture of an irascille and foul-mouthed’
husband coustantly doing battle with a domineering wife, %¢
eeems Likely that the iupression of “sweetness and Light” wales,
they generated during their evening with the Station case
officers was atypical and wanufactured for the benefit of |
_ their hosts. This, of course, is natural with most couples
whe echoese net to air their personal differences in public,
bue from our peint of view, this lack of harmony betweea
ABBOOR and his wife offers distinct pussibilities for the
Station te contact the wife independentiy and offer her welcone
diversions from the regivented and turbulent Lite with ber
husband. (Ne call your attention to the reference since it
wey Bravise some useful puints in devising an approach to
ABboOR's wife), Their present home leave in the USSR would
seem vo offer a readyemade situation for renewod contact when
they return since netural curiosity about their activities
and Gime spent at home could be sufficient grounds for aa
duvdtation. cither to both of singly to spend an evening togethers
We: offer those thoughta only because they spyear ta ue cs geod
opportunities not only to maintain Staffer contact with a
target of priority interent, but to dise develop this contact
further te the dugrea of intimacy needed for a recognition
and ultiaatic. exploitation of his susceptibilities.

 
       
      
     
    
    
   
   
     
   
    
    
    
    
   
    
      
      
     
     
   
 

  

    
     
 
     

      
    
   
   
     
     
   
   

    

 
 

| *@_ Since therg are no séeess agente now in touch with
ABBOOK, we suggest, ae a supplement te the direct Staffer
contact end in order to obtain additvonal assossments of Subject
from other angles, the Station consider “running” controlled

other werds, we would crente a Felatiouship. where none pres
