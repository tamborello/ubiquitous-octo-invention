alleged that SILVERS absconded with approximately $80,000.00
of the gud 8; money and after taking the money turned up with
SCUAEEPERESH and went to Florida. LOMBARDOZZI allegedly
ordered them executed and they reportedly were murdered and_
their bodies buried near Miami, Florida.

On February 10, 1961, GEORGE SCHAEFFER, who
allegedly was murdered with SILVERS, was located by Bureau
Agents and interviewed in Brooklyn, New York, but denied
knowing LOMBARDOZZI, SILVERS and other Brooklyn -hoodlums.

‘Investigation by New York Office has not established
association between LOMBARDOZZI and SCHAEFFER. Information
was received by the New York Office that SILVERS and MAX
GOLOB, also known as "MAXIE THE JERK", probably identical
with MAX GOLOB, FBI Number 175052, stuck up AL STRAUS, also
known as "CAPTAIN BLY" in Miami Beach, Florida, ;@ate .
unknown, and took $30,000.00 from him. STRAUS was allegedly
working for MIKE COPPOLA in Miami at the time of the hold up.
SILVERS and GOLOB were called in by COPPOLA for a meeting,
also attended by NAT RAYMOND, COPPOLA told SILVERS and

' GOLOB the money they had taken from STRAUS was his and he

wanted it back. SILVERS apparently made no effort to comply
and was taken to North Miami Shores, where he was killed and
his body dumped into "the gulfstream". GOLOB was’ given time

° by COPPOLA-to return the money. “Subsequently, GOLOB: returned

to Brooklyn;:New York, where he’ts presently: living.” COPPOLA
allegedly. brought in an’ individual from Hollywood, Florida,

whowith AL STRAUS murdered SILVERS. AL STRAUS* is presently, }! va

residing. in the vicinity of RL Werhead, Long . island.
