Title: John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The JFK Task Force (JFKTF) requests all offices and
legats to search for records and forward records to the JFKTF.

Enclosures: Copy of the letter received from the Assassination
Records Review Board (the Board).

Details: In 1992, Congress signed the Act mandating federal
agencies to release all documents concerning the presidential
assassination or information related by conspiracy theory to the
assassination. The Act narrowly defined the types of information
that agencies could still protect by postponement until the year
2017. The Act also established the Board as a separate entity to
oversee the release of material from the federal agencies to the
National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Beyond the
Board’s oversight responsibilities, the Act charged the Board
with the duties of reviewing agencies’ proposed postponements
with the agencies’ evidence for approval or denial and
researching additional areas of information for new material
related to the assassination. , The FBI has been working with the
Board since its inception to meet the. requirements of the Act.

On November 29, 1996, the Board wrote a letter to the
FBI setting forth a formal compliance program. The letter
requested the FBI’s cooperation with the Board “in discharging its
responsibility of assuring Congress and the American’ people that
the goals of the JFK Act will be accomplished to the greatest
reasonable extent.” The compliance program is the Board’s answer
to demonstrating “to the American public that a thorough, good-
faith, and diligent effort have been made to locate and release
all remaining assassination-related records within the control of
the United States Government (and that the Government is not
hiding any such materials from public disclosure) .” With this
philosophy in mind, the Board has forwarded letters to the FBI
requesting additional information for their review and possible

inclusion in the JFK collection.

On June 18, 1997, the JFKTF received a letter from the
Board requesting all files and documents for Judith“Campbel
Exner, a.k.a. Judith Immoor, Judith’Campbell, Judith Eileeri’Von
Immoor, Judy Campbell, and Judy Exner. Ms. Campbell was born in -
the state of New York with a possible birth year of 1934. Each
office and legat should search all their systems (general
indices, confidential indices, ELSURS, etc.) for all information
(main files, see references, ELSUR logs, etc.) related to
Ms. Campbell. The original documents should be transferred to the
JFKTF at FBIHQ by July 10, 1997.

The original documents are necessary to meet the
requirements of the Act. Should the Board determine the
documents to be assassination records the originals will
eventually be transferred to NARA. Therefore, any responsive
documents should be copied before forwarding to the JFKTF. If
the Board decides that the documents do not fall within the realm
of the Act, the documents will be returned to your office, but
not until the Board completes this project.

All offices and legats should respond even if the
search is negative. The response is important for the FBI’s
compliance with the Act. If you have any questions, please
contact Yvonne Brewer at extension 9238 or Carol Keeley on
extension 9494.
