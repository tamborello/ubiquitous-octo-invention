Re Bureau teletype to Boston, et al., 3/28/69,

Attached for the Bureau are the original and three
copies of an LHM treating of the "Philadelphia Family of La
Cosa Nostra;" and the original and three copies of an LHM
treating of the "Bufalino" Family of La Cosa Nostra (LCN.)

With respect to the existence of the "Bufalino"
Family of LCN, it is pointed out that the existence of this
Family was not established through the use of electronic
surveillance. PH 672-C-TE has advised that to his knowledge
RUSSELL BUFALINO is a Capodecina in the Family formerly
headed by THOMAS LUCHESE; however, NY 6436-C-TE has advised
that JOE BARBARA, when living, was the head of his own
"Family" and was the Boss. The "Family" which BARBARA headed
is now known as the "Bufalino Family," according to NY 6436-C-
TE. ri

 

 

New York has advised that NY 6436-C-TE is considered
by them to be a highly valuable and knowledgeable informant.
Despite this, the Bureau may not wish to go on record saying
there is such a thing as the "Bufalino Family" until such time
as additional corroborating jntelligence information is

available. EC G- 15 G2 Ce OS COSY = Ht
