period about her and any ties to her association © ~
with the Agency would be reflected in her 201

file. The Committee's interest in the unrelated
sensitive operation seems unreasonable to us.

3.. Recommendation: It is recommended that a meeting
be arranged between either you or Mr. Carlucci and Chairman
Stokes to review our understanding of the status of the first
four items, which have already been satisfied or can be, and.
to persuade the Chairman to not precipitate a confrontation
on the sensitive operational file. . vos vie

’ SUBJECT : Letter of 11 September 1978 fron

Chairman Stokes, House Select Committee
on Assassinations : rr

1. Action Requested: A recommendation for your approval .

is at paragraph 3.

2. Background: The House Select Committee on Assassina-
tions (HSCA) has Tet a subpoena lapse without execution, and
the 11 September letter from Chairman Stokes, a copy of which
is attached, lists five items of interest to the Committee,
some of which were the subject of the earlier request. The
five items are noted and commented on briefly below: .

a. The letter specifies interest in "mug
books" shown to a Cuban defector, Having raised
the questions, the letter then goes on to say that’ -
this "is no longer a matter in dispute." The
material has been available for review by HSCA ~~
personnel for some two weeks now. -

b. The Committee is interested in "all
debriefing memoranda" relating to a Cuban defector.
This was one of the subjects in the subpoena and
relates to a debriefing memorandum (numbered 40)
in a series of sequentially numbered documents.
In fact, we believe that a debriefing memorandum
that is unnumbered, but that appears to have been
in the sequence of debriefings, has been reviewed
by the HSCA investigator. That investigator has
been briefed on this and a written summary has
been available for his review. Chairman Stokes
may not have been informed accurately on this
point.and we think that the explanation available
is a valid one, . :

: c. The HSCA requests."ali’ files and file
references" to a person not named in the letter,
but who was William K. Harvey.°.The HSCA has seen
“ the official personnel folder on Mr. Harvey for
the period requested (1959-1966). The Office of : ;
Security files were also reviewed, -but-these had“ -.°.
been sanitized to. remove references to personal.
difficulties experienced by him in a later part
of his career... No complaint had been.made-to the
Office of Security about the sanitization, and.‘ =.
, |. they are ready to-show these sections to a. senior
_. member, only,.on the. HSCA staff. -

 

d. ‘The HSCA request for:"the three-volume ©
history and analysis" of the Mexico-City’ Station
was a subject of the subpoena. -It..is-inaccurate
to describe. it as an analysis, and it’is more a
. compilation of terse summaries than a true history.
It covers a twenty-two year period inthe history =
- of the Station from 1947 to 1969, with a wide range
of subject matter that by any normal reasoning is
irrelevant to the question of the assassination of
~ President Kennedy. The rationale offered up. by «..
Mr. Blakey is that he must understand the history
+ of the Station to evaluate its performance. during -:.
the investigation of the assassination. While the.
Agency's position has been that this is irrelevant.
to the charter of the Committee, LA Division is ---
prepared to let either Mr. Blakey or his deputy,’
Mr. Cornwell, review this. We realize that both
gentlemen are very busy, but the total compilation
is too sensitive to let the young men on the staff
have access to it. o to Es i

 

 

e. The request for access to."all’ files: and
file references to a Cuban citizen" for the period |
1 September 1963 through 31 January 1964 raises the ..°
question of the Proenza case and a deception opera- -
tion in which Miss Proenza was one of the targets..:
Contrary to. the statement in the letter, a House _
‘investigator was shown the 201 file for the period ..
from January 1963 through May 1964;° Access to -
the operational file on the deception matter was --
denied the Committee on the recommendation of the
DDO, approved by the DDCI.. LA Division believes
this contains no reference to the subject of the
investigation, and is reviewing the files again
to verify this. The origin of the interest in this
