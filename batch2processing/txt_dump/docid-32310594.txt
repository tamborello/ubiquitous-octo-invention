On February- 21, 1975, FABIAN went to Newark and
while under FBI physical surveillance, participated ina
meeting held by Cuban exiles. On February 23, 1975, he
returned to Miami. FABIAN said the bombing of the Red

' Chinese Building was called off because of FBI security
measures. He said that for further military operations MIM
would issue press releases under the name of The Commandos
of the 13th of March. ; i

On March 14, 1975, FABIAN said he planned to operate
a training camp in Central Florida and recruited 10 men to i
be trained in the use of explosives.

On March 25, 1975, a fire was started at the
Colombian Consulate, Washington, D.C., and on March 28, 1975,
MIM claimed responsibility, although there was no corroborat=
ing evidence and other exile organizations doubted the MIM claim.

On April 2, 1975, FABIAN was interviewed by special
Agents of the FBI, wherein he claimed his organization had
13 members in Miami, five in New Jersey and disclaimed any
knowledge of bombing or terrorist plans by his group.
