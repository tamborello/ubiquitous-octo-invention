FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

4 [ L-  Sune 16, 1975

— Date of trans¢ription,
v

Special Agent Joseph E. Battle, currently assigned to the
Washington Field Cffice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished the
following information:

te
t

Approximately.two weeks subsequent to the death of former
Director J, Edgar Hoover on 5/2/72, SA Battle accompanied Robert G.
Kunkel, former Special Agent in Charge of the Washington Field Cftice,
to Mr. Hoover" s former residence. When they arrived at the residence
they went into the . "asement area and obtained approximately eight card-
board boxes which were sealed and which they loaded in a Bureau station-
wagon, This material was then transported to the loading dock at the
rear of the Washington Field Cffice and he does not know what happened
to the material except that it was picked up by either Kenneth Shaffer,
Assistant Chief Clerk, or Thomas Barden Dudney, Chief Clerk,

- Washington Field Office. .

He estimated that at least two trivs ami pussibiy uircc Wore |||
made to Mr. Hoover's residence with Mr. Kunkel and on each occasion
approximately cignt cardboard boxes were returned to the Washington _
Field Office in the manner described above. He believed the above
described events took place over a period of approximately two weeks
and stated that the third trip could possibly have been by himself, He
thought possibly that he may have gotten a radio call while in the Bureau

‘car to pick up the material to return to Washington Field Cffice. He does
not know whe’ the cardboard boxes contained and can’t recall that he was
ever told what they contained by Mr. Kunkel.

During the removal of the cardboard boxes from the base-
ment of Mr. Hoover's residence he does not recall ever seeing any file
cabinets located in the basement area.

He has no recollection of picking up any material from the
office of Mr. Hoover subsequent to his death for delivery anywhere.
