DL 100-8561

PHIL BARKER told the group that he had received a tele-
Phone call from GILBERT GARCIA of the G, I. Forum in which GARCIA
told PHIL BARKER that there would be an organizational meeting of
the workers in the GONZALEZ campaign scheduled for Monday, 1/30/61
at the St. Joseph Youth Center on North side Fort Worth.

HAROLD MANN suggested that all of the male members of the
CP group should go to the above meeting but that each member should
go to the meeting alone and not in a group.

HAROLD MANN said that GARCIA was informed sometime ago
by MARGARET CARTER of the Democrat Organizing Committee (DOC) that
he was a communist and since that time GARCIA bas shunned MANN,
HAROLD also said he would not like for the whole group to be banned
as communists on account of his being with them. HAROLD told
EARLENE MARTIN to remain at home and write all of the poll taxes
she could and encourage all the people possible to vote for GONZALEZ.
He said the male members would go to the meeting and see if the CP
could be instrumental in the GONZALEZ campaign.

BETTY MANN was at first undecided as to whether she should
go to the meeting with HAROLD MANN, however, later she said she
had decided to go to the meeting but that she and HAROLD would-
arrive about ten minutes after the meeting started.

The latter portion of this meeting was devoted to a
discussion of the possibilities of CAROLYN STANSBURY becoming a
member of the group. PHIL BARKER told. them that CAROLYN had asked
him if she could return to one of the group meetings but PHIL said
he had to discuss the Marx theory with her some more and make sure
that she is ready. BARKER said that he is very doubtful that
CAROLYN would make a good Communist but that he never turns down an
opportunity to try to recruit someone into the group.

PHIL BARKER also said that CAROLYN kas a friend by the-
name of NAOMI (LNU) who wants to come to the meeting with CAROLYN
but that she will definitely be refused until he can learn more
about her.

BARKER said that CAROLYN STANSBURY is currently attending

Arlington State College. ’

(DL=-20-S has also reported concerning the above CP meeting
of 1/29/61.)
