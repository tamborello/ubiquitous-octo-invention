the public and was receiving visitors as of 1010. The camera
worked well and was photographing people entering and leaving

CUBAN EMBASSY AND CONSULATE

In 1963, the Cuban Embassy and Consulate were located
in their own compound at Calle Francisco Marquez 160. These
installations had their own separate entrances. Visitors
were able to enter the Cuban Consulate from 1000 to 1400,
Monday through Friday. Embassy office hours were 0900 to
1700 on the same days. Visttors to the Embassy, however,
usually appeared before 1400. Consulate hours are confirmed
by a plaque beside the Consulate's street entrance. [See
photograph of Consulate entrance.] and by Silvia DURAN [see
her interrogation in Commission Exhibit 2121, p. 38, and
Commission Exhibit 2123, p. 671, volume XXIV]; she added

entrance to the Cuban Embassy compound. The operation pro-
duged photographs of persons associated withnthe Cuban Embassy,
both staff and visitors. Within hoursbE the arrival of a new
embassy staff member, his photograph was in the hands of the
Station. In addition to the identification of staff personnel
and visitors, the photographs (accompanied by a log maintained
by the LIONION agents) revealed patterns of action (arrivals and
departures) and details of personal associations which were of
great value to the Station in mounting operations against the
tarpet.

LIONION covered the Cuban Embassy entrance from 0912 to

last one at 1330); from 0915 to 1350 on 30 September (18

rage of the Cuban Embassy did not include the Cuban Consulate
until October [MEXI-7098 (IN 69127), 27 November 1963 -

FOIA No. 164-69], the Station had made the decision on 23

September 1963 to cover the Cuban Consulate street entrance

“(which had been closed from November 1962 to August 1963 as

a result of an incident directed against the Embassy in 1962.)

“During the morning of 27 September, a Station officer
installed a VLS22 Trigger Device at the LIERODE [sic - LIONION]
basehouse and used the 500mm lens issued with this system, one
400mm Telyt, one reflex housing to be used with the Telyt adap-

solenoid release for mounting and triggering the Robot Star
camera, one Kodak K-100 adapted for single or burst type ex-

posure, one solenoid release to be used with the K- 100 (when

this item was tested, the arm of the solenoid which attaches
to the K-100 exposure lever did not fit properly and would
stick when triggered by the solenoid... This was corrected by
remachining the screw position of the lever of the solenoid),
one 152mm £/4 Cine Ektar lens, and two additional tripods.
The base agent was requested to test the Robot Star camera
for four days and the K-100 for another four days.

In November 1963, the Station reported that during the
first two weeks of operation, the VLS-2 would trigger traffic
entering and @eaving the target entrance. Concerned with the
consumption of film and the necessity of reloading the camera
twice daily, the base agent devised a system whereby the VLS-2
would only photograph people leaving but not entering the tar-
get building. His system worked about 80 percent of the time,
cutting film consumption considerably. ,

According to HMMA-15979 dated 18 November 1960 the
LLEMPRY objectives of that “Sbération were to collect opera-
tional information pertaining to LIMERICK personnel and phy--
sical facilities through the use of photographic base
houses [surveillance]. Together with their extensive photo-
graphic coverage of the LIMERICK target, the photographic
bases also contributed other types of operational information:

we a, LIMITED - This base compiled daily logs

indicating all arrivals, departures, and, where possible,
identities of every person visiting or working at the

LIMERICK target. This information-.was particularly

useful in keeping track of LIMERICK personnel and assis-

ting with the identification of visitors to the installa-
tion. Also, LIMITED maintained a summary attendance

list of LIMERICK employees on a daily basis; this enabled

the Station to ascertain quickly the presence or absence

of an employee on any given day. Finally, one other sig-
nificant service is performed by this base, the radio
- dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance.team on LIM-

ERICK personnel and targets of opportunity. LIMITED's

photographic coverage was concentrated on visitors, as

opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK installation. %.. J

PHOTOGRAPHIC SURVEILLANCE OF THE CUBAN AND SOVIET DIPLOMATIC
INSTALLATIONS

During the period when OSWALD was in Mexico City -

27 September to 2 October 1963 - there were three bases
set up to photograph visitors entering and leaving the
Cuban and Sovéet diplomatic installations. Two bases -
LIMITED and LILYRIC - were targetted against the main
entrance into the Soviet compound; one base - LIONION -
was targetted against the entrance to the Cuban Embassy.

A second base to cover the street entrance to the Cuban
Consulate was being established on 27 September. Until
the 27th the entrance to the Cuban Consulate had

never been covéred; in fact, the door had been closed from
November 1962 until 7 August 1963 as a result of an incident
in 1962 directed against the Cuban Embassy.

Although records exist on the three above operations,
the records are incomplete and are ext? consistent only in
their inconsistency. It is, for example, impossible to re-
concile operational reporting with operational activity as
shown inf the logs covering photographic surveillance of

the Cuban and Soviet installations.

SOVIET EMBASSY AND CONSULATE
In 1963, the Soviet Embassy and Consulate were located
(and still are) located at Calle Calzada Tabcucaya 204,
Mexico City. <A twenty-four guard protected the entrance to
the compound. According to Agency records, the Embassy and
Consulate were not open to the public; offices in the Soviet
compound sould be visited by appointment only. Visitors rang
the bell at the main entrance at all hours. Russian-speaking
visitors were permitted to enter at any time; others were
‘usually turned away by the guard after normal working houss.
Normal working hours during September 1963, when Lee Harvey
OSWALD visited the Soviet Consulate, were from 0900 to 1800.
Later, the hours for Mondays and Fridays were changed to

0900 to 1400 hours.

prepared weekly reports on LIMERICK employees and

their wives. LILYRIC also performed the assignment

of noting and reporting the license plate numbers of al

all cars bringing visitors to the LIMERICK installa-

tion. LILYRIC photographs also were concentrated on
visitors to the target, as opposed to employees. It
should be noted that LILYRIC overated during the hours
from daylight to 1400 hours each day of the week except

Sunday. The LIMITED base maintained photographic

coverage from 1400 hours to darkness each dav except

Sunday. [Comment: An earlier statement in February

1957 indicated that the two bases operated at staggered

hours without the knowledge of the other. ~- HMMA-6074,

6 February 1957.)

c. LICALLA - The LICALLA base contfibuted to the
collection of operational information through photo-
graphic coverage of LIMERICK employees and their
families. Also, the base operator supplied extremely
worthwhile information pertaining to the apparent
positions and jobs of the target employees. He accom-
plished this objective by careful observation and
analysis. LICALLA also maintained a daily attendance
roster of all LIMERICK employees. LICALLA coverage of
the target, both photographic and physical observations,
enabled the Station to keep abreast of LIMERICK per-
sonnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's
counterespionage effort. '

_[HMMA-15979, 18 November 1960 - 50-06-74/1]

The objectives of the three bases described above re-
mained valid until at least 1964. Later project renewals
usually referred to the 1960 dispatch in which the functions
of the three bases were described in detail.

(See HMMA-20052, 18 October 1962; HMMA-22387, 25 October 1963;
HMMA-24650, 29 October 1964. - 50-06-74/1)] .

According to operational reporting, LIMITED operated
from 1200 to 1800 or dary (as the daily situation dictated)
on weekdays and 0900 to 1400 Saturdays. (These hours were
subject to change to fit Station requirements.) Special
coverage was arranged on a need basis; however, past ex-
perience had shown regular coverage of Saturday afternoons
and Sundays was not rewarding.

(HMMA-23343, 30 April 1964 - 50-06-74/3)

The LILYRIC basehouse generally operated from 0900
to 1400 or 1500 on weekdays. This statement, however, does
not coincide the record. LILYRIC records for the period
in question do not exist. The logs for the LIMITED opera-
tion indicate that LIMITED operated during the morning
hours. On 27 September 1963, the log shows that the camera
was operative from 1018 to 1146. On 30 September 1963 the
camera was not operative, no reason given. And on 1 October 1.
1963, the camera took only one photograph at 1251.

On 24 September 1964, the Station received information
from Headquarters that an LIEMPTY project photograph, one of
several supplied to the Warren Commission in November 1963,
was to be published in the Warren Commission's final report.
Since LIMERICK officials would undoubtedly be able to re-
cognize the individual in the photographs. as a visitor to
their installation and with a view towards the attendant
possible security problems, the LICALLA, LILYRIC, and- LIMITED
operations were suspended on 26 and 27 September and all
photographic and other compromising equipment was removed
from these basehouses. All. basehouse personnel were briefed
in general on the situation and specifically on how to cope
with any possible inquiries from government officials or
LIMERICK inspired or prompted newsmen. Upon receipt by the
Station of a copy of the photograph, it was determined that
the LIMITED Bésehouse had provided the photograph in question.
This consideration, linked with further analysis of the limi-
tations upon any counteractions available to LIMERICK offi-
cials, allowed the gation to re-activate the LICALLA and

LILYRIC bases on a phased basis in early October 1964.
