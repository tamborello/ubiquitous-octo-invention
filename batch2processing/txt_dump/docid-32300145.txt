A confidential source abroad advised on August 12,
1963, as follows:

The records of the Mexican Immigration Service
veflect that shortly after the incorporation. of the Cia.
Azteca de Administracion, S..A., on April 20, 1960, a
series of letters was directed to the Mexican Immigration -
Service by this company in an effort to obtain authorization
for STEWART B. HOPPS to assume charge of the company. After
several refusals, said authorization was finally granted
on June 13, 1961, but apparently HOPPS did not enter Mexico
as the Mexican Government files fail to reflect any further
action in this connection. ;

These same Mexican Government files reflect that
JOHN M. KEARNEY (CLEARY) was born March 20, 1895, at La
Plata, Maryland, and entered Mexico at Nuevo Laredo on .
October 20, 1920, and was engaged for many years at Veracruz
and vicinity as an employee of oil companies (not specified).
He 1s married to MARIA TERESA NOLAN and he became a Mexican
citizen on April 20, 1945.

The records of the Visa Section of the American
Embassy reflect that JOHN KEARNEY (CLEARY), Mexican citizen,
born March 20, 1895, at La Plata, Maryland, with residence
at Rio Tamesis #3, Mexico City, was issued visas on
January 3, 1961, and December 26, 1962. He has an unlimited
visa to travel to the United States until December 26, 1963.
Efforts were made to locate KEARNEY at the above address;
however, at this address there is now located a singing
school.

T-2, who has furnished reliable information in
the past, advised on August 28, 1963, as follows:

The records of the Banco del Pais, S. A., contain
the following information on cards in the Spanish language,
translated as follows:

Account #21246 - sub account #4-21246 in dollars

in name of Intercontinental Insurance and Surety

Co., S. A., by Cia. Azteca de Administracion,
