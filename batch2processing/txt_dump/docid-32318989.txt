Dear Mr. O'Brien: John F Kennedy

RE: RCMP/FBI RELATIONS REGARDING ATIP/FOIA

Thank you for your letter of March 3, 1993. I regret absence
delayed this response until my return to duty this date.

I will address your query in two aspects. Firstly, while I am
unable to confirm whether the original agreements and RCMP/FBI
relationships were in fact once deemed top secret and non-
disclosable, if they were, it would have been because Security...
Service then was part of the RCMP. In 1984, our Security Services LS
were separated from the RCMP and became the Canadian Security e
Intelligence Service (CSIS) and therefore any premise for deeming

our relationship top secret has largely disappeared.

Our continuing operational relationship (as opposed to security and
intelligence relationship) is today largely a matter of public
record and knowledge as I mentioned to Grant Harmon. We do not seek
to keep the general relationship secret and it would not be
acceptable under Canadian law to refuse to name the source of "in
confidence" information, except on a case-by-case basis, where that
identification in itself could prejudice law enforcement. This
does not in anyway affect our ability to totally protect exchanges
E4 of information from the FBI and we continue to totally exempt all
FBI communications. When consulted this morning, Assistant
Commissioner McCONNELL, the RCMP Director of Enforcement Services,
agreed that the relationship is such a logical and expected one
given our geographic co-location and membership in the IACP and
INTERPOL etc, that we would be embarrassed to acknowledge the
absence of an operational ay if one did not exist

Notwithstanding the: above, I am not proposing any changes to our
. agreement, I merely felt it would be useful for you to understand
Wye above distinction in our approach to it.
