"You know his name. A big shot. A big

CAMMILLERI subsequently departed remarking that he
would return in a few days and commenting that he does not
want to use the telephone.

Later on the same date, JOSEPH BONGIORNO was observed
with PETER A. M&GADDINO and the subject. BONGIORNO indicated
that he was having trouble with his Social Security. The
informant ascertained during this conversation that BONGIORNO
was born 9/6/16, that his parents were GUSEPPI BONGIORNO and
CONSTANCE CAROTTO (ph), and that he has Social Security Number
101-03-8193.

It should be noted that in this discussion the subject
stated the correct spelling of BONGIORNO's mother's maiden
name was CAROTTO (ph) with two Ts.

Copies ef this letter are being furnished to the
Bureau, Albany, and New York for information purposes and in
view of the conjectural relationship of the Assemblyman, JOSEPH
CARLINO.
