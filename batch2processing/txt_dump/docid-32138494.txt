Letter to Legat, Mexico City
RE: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

NOTE

San Diego advised on 11-27-64 the Slate Judicial
Police, Mexicali, Baja, California, had heard: that during
President Kennedy's visit to Mexico City in 1962, the Serret
Police of Mexico City arrested an American, who was allegedly
planning to assassinate him, This was not confirmed, Legat,
Mexico City advised that during President Kennedy's visit to
Mexico City 6/29-7/1/62, only one American was arrested, David
Joseph St, Jacques, who was a psychopathic case. He approached
the President's car as he thought all cancer cases in the United :
States were caused by Noxious fumes released by chemical factories, |:
and he wanted to discuss this matter with the President. The :
original information received from Baja, California, was furnished
to Secret Service. Legat, Mexico City has been instructed to
submit inserts and LHM for report and dissemination to Secret
Service, even though alleged assassination information was erroneous.
