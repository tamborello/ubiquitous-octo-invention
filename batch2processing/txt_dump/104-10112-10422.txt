Exposure of CIA Personnel
#601 818

1. Per instruction of the Deputy Chief, Security Research
Staff, the following is a summary of information concerning several

Subject: TOON, Malcolm, #412 916, (A-226).

concentrated its attack on Mr. Malcolm TOON as the supervisor of sev- -

widuals are listed as follows:
