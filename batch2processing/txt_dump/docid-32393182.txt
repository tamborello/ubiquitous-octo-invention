MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 29.7.68

SUBJECT: OSWALD-- Nosenko

 

1. On 26 July called to my attention
an aspect of NOSENKO's information which must be thoroughly
examined when we attempt to assess analyze Gid NOSENKO's
story about the OSWALD case. QBs been reading all the

latest from N COSENKQ) re OSWALD and it is his impression there

are not only gaps in the info from the stanpoint that N (COSENKQ)

should know more but also some‘aspects which don't ring true.
