MORALES also indicated during these interviews that he

had placed sports-type hub caps on this car just prior

to his arrest on 2/14/68, when the car was loaned to KABA
(note reference to sports wheels in enclosure). The car

is a brown Pontiac sedan, purchased by MORALES in Septémber,
1967, in the name of IRMINA BOUZA, his mistress. Although
the car is in her name, she has no driver*s license and has
never driven.it (note reference to her having transported
explosives and Cuban Power papers in this car). Since she
was unable to drive the car, it was loaned to KABA upon
MORALES* arrest.

 

; . During a subsequent interview with MORALES, he

i ie advised he had obtained a confession from KABA to the effect
2 “i he had been llecting and reporting information to a Cuban

fe exste, manta ASIP, and it is now felt MASIP is probably

 

source,

stated he was positive of the date of the
above conversation as 3/16/68, a Saturday, Regarding the
identification of the "tall and thin" female-as IRMINIA
BOUZA, it is noted inquiry by Bureau Agents at the apartment
of BOUZA on the night of 3/14/68, in an attempt to locate
MORALES for interview, determined MORALES had taken BOUZA- *
to Mt. Sinai Hospital, Miami Beach, to have her baby. It.
was subsequently determined that she had a baby on the night
of 3/14/68 and remained in the hospital over the weekend,
Thus, she could not have been in the Camaguey Restaurant
on 3/16/68, as claimed_b This fact, along with
the illogicalness of story that he was able to
overhear and retain all names and facts set forth in this ~
report and his subsequent evasiveness during interview,
leads to the conclusion his story was fabricated It would
appear this conclusion should have been reached (by CIA Biso.

_A great deal of information sent to Miami (by CIA
is attributed to “a group of Cuban emigres trained in the
techniques of information collection,” with no attempt at
identifying the origin of the ‘information. Apparently, CIA,:
iami, operates several such groups, some of which are more

It is recognized this is a delicate issue and as
stated in retel of 3/26/68, this matter was discussed in- - ;
formally/ with CIA liaison, AUSTIN HORN, on 3/25/68, at which “
time he agreed with these observations, stating he would
discuss the matter with appropriate personn 1 and attempt to
correct this situation in the future." u)

This matter was again brought up on4/2/68/when
the SAC met with PAUL HENZE, Chief of Station, CiA, ami.
HENZE stated his organization is not now operating any
agents or informants, as such, in exile groups, and is not :
engaging in any counterintelligence activities in the United:
States. He stated his station is, in fact, cutting back its

additions such as correction of the name IRMINA BOUZA

basic information in these paragraphs obviously was taken
from CAS/M-2403. 9)

 

‘As set forth in referenced teletypes,
upon contact by Bureau Agents on 3/23/68, advised he had
not furnished certain information attributed to himlin
this document, specifically that Cuban Power is com$oSed
of two numbered cells the listing of members of each
cell, In fact, (ie Bivisea he had no information to
the effect this organization is composed of two numbered
cells, leading Miami to believe CIA has inadvertently
furnished mieerer= information in their attempt to round

advised Bureau Agents that on Saturday,
3/16/68, he had been seated in the Camaguey Restaurant,
Miami, where he overheard a conversation among three Cuban
males’ and one Cuban female seated nearby. With the
exception of the female, he was unable to furnish any
description of these individuals, stating he had not looked *
in their direction, The female departed and he briefly
glanced at her as she passed, but he did not see her face

and would not recognize her again. He could describe

her only as a white female, of Latin appearance, who was

“tall and thin.” (This is believed to be an attempt on

his part to strengthen the later identification of her

as BOUZA, who is actually nearly 6 feet tall and very ~
slender.) Following her departure, one of those remaining
inquired as to her identity and was told she was IRMINIA
BOUZA, former secretary of WENDELL. ROLLASON and currently

a night employee of "The Miami Herald" newspaper, According

: to a all of the additional details concerning her =

; connéction with and activities on behalf of the Cuban Power,
as well as names of Cuban Power members and sympathizers

and other details(set out in CAS/M~2401,]were obtained by OU
him during this conversation.

Although| _||claimed he was able to recall

asked if he had also been able to recall this number without y
benefit of notes, at which time he admitted this number had cane
been furnished by a "confidential connection" whom he refused
to identify.- He was obviously upset at being pinned down

as to the source of his information and attempted to explain
his refusal to identify his source by vaguely stating he was
a friend in the bank where MORALES had maintained his account,
