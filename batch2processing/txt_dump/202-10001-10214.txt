To provide documentary and photo
graphic evidence of the tyranny of
the Communist regime.

To provide current intelligence on
key security resources of the
regime,

To provide current intelligence on the
actions and intentions of the regime.

 

CONSIDERATIONS

 

 

 

 

 

Number ef agents in each team and selection of areas
will be determined by developments of the previous
actions and by conditions.

Numbers, areas, and supplies are completely dependent
upon conditions at the time, and upon policy approval of
methods to be used (that ia, if air delivery can be used,
or if this activity must depend upon maritime delivery}.

This evidence will be used by CLA and USIA to neutralize

the influence of Castro and the Communists in the Weat- |
ern Hemisphere. _t

This is conceived of as ground surveys, and the possible
recruitment of military and other official personnel as

intelligence agents.

CONSIDERATIONS

Possible future use in communications and support.

Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose
of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions
controlling these factors. lf the recruitment and train-
ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit-
ment and training will be much lese difficult than if
they are limited to intelligence -collection purposes
only.

There are ‘colonies in Washington, D.C., and other
U.S. cities which are "little Cubas." Family, Church,
and business interests provoke unusual personal ties
inside Cuba for some of these residents; a real potential
exists for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail-
able. {FBI support and coordination ia basic in this
effort. }

CONSIDERATIONS

 

There is a risk that this action will dieclose this U.S,
intelligence activity within Cuba, Selected personnel
are being intensively trained. Thia first team has 2
agents. An area in which resistance has been reported
has been selected. Agent operations muat etay alive,
make useful contacts, and report securely to CLA,
Physical risk to personnel is substantial, due to lack

of intelligence. Firat reports from first team are
expected by the end of March, while reporta from the |
second and third teams, dispatched in March, are ex- }
pected to start in April.

Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained
for paramilitary skills ag well as intelligence collection, |
with the thought that they will be in place inside Cuba

and ready to act whenever paramilitary operations are
decided upon. However, CIA has noted that, once the
agents are inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled
effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort i
will be made to attempt such control, i

lege ataif intelligence officers may algo be used in the |

future for.cor handling, if future

PURPOSE

To collect intelligence required for the
operations, to identify and earmark in-
telligence assets as refugees arrive,
and to provide security against Com-
munist agent operations.

To up-date NIE 85-62, so that current
estimates can be considered at national
policy levels.

CONSIDERATIONS

This operation, in response to early recommendation
as easential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at
utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with
anew building completed and occupied, and with a

staff of 43 at work, Operations commenced 15 February
and, as of 9 March, 33 people were active at the Center.
(CIA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,
State, USIA.)

Ae the operations develop, there will be both increased
intelligence collection and a need for as current an In-
telligence Estimate ag the U.S. can praduce meaningfully.
it is likely that a more informal method of producing an
Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level {than
now governing the issuance of NUE's) may have te be
followed. CLA ie now publishing daily intelligence gam ~-
maxies on Cuba and is planning a bi-monthly or weekly
report summing up intelligence for this purpose. {CIA
vesponsibility, with support of others as required. }
