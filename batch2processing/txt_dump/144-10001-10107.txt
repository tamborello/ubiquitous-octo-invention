MCCLOY INTERVIEWED BY [ow ASSASSINATION

INVESTIGATION :, 7

4 Dec 63 1000
Routine

 

In conversation. with me, MCCLOY, 4:member of the presidential
commission stated that’ he has sefious doubts ‘ef the credibility
of the investigation to date . He does not: eliminate the possibility
that the attempt on KENNEDY Was made ‘by two’ ‘persons. However, in
view of JOHNSON's order that thé- commission investigate also the
circumstances of OSWALD's slaying, some ofthe’ ‘commission's
operations and its report could come after Rupy' 's trial and perhaps
-even after the verdict and appeals. In the mantime., the trial
was postponed until 3 January [sic], and the’ FBI “released to the
press information that their investigation confinmss OSWALD" s guilt,
and that he had no accomplices. .
