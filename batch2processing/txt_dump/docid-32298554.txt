in the US. This may be having an effect on this movement

in the US as it has been pointed out that it may be the

reason for the cooling of the relationship between JAMES

and ANN LEE and the subject. \

It has been reported in the past that non-Chinese
and particularly Americans, even though they are Communists,
are being avoided by Chinese Communists in order to
conform with the program to remove foreign influence from.
their movement. .

This may alter completely the subject's position
in the US vis-a-vis the CP of China.

It is believed that the subject's trip in
December, 1966, may have been to determine what her posi-
tion and course of action should be in the US concerning
the cultural revolution.
