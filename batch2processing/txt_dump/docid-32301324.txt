contacted by FRANK and to ‘to completely disassociate himself

Chicago recalls that “when contacted by co [Ss Ss :
and LEIBEL BERGMAN, in April, 1968, LOMAN was semi-hostile, -
indicated no sympathy for a revolutionary solution to the.
Afro-American problems, and expressed himself as in agreement —
with the solution offered by the late Senator ROBERT.-F, . KENNEDY
and the non-violent program of the late Dr. MARTIN “LUTHER KING,

On the other hand, however, it is quite possible that
SUE FRANK did contact. LOMAN after informant: used LOMAN's name °
in making contact with her in July. This would be “in keeping.
with her reputation for shrewdness and caution in all political
activities Res ud) :
