28 July 1994

Results of 25 July meeting with Mike Getsey and Steve Tilley
re JFK database extract.

 

The following item numbers are keyed tc
memo of 27 June, same subject.

 

 

#1. “restricted data" -- NARA will accept disk with aa

. restricted data withheld. Issues will be re-visited after a
decision on disposition of CIA's classified (retention) JEK
collection.

#2. ‘Exemption Codes --.The Agency is not required to. use
the additional exemption codes or add them to its system,
however, they must be accounted for in the extract disk. }
Getsey suggested that this could be done by the extract
program. Question: is it possible to add a couple of codes
without a major programming problem?

#3. White paper for Iden Aids - yes.

#4, Keywords -- NARA has no problem with the length of
CIA's 15 character field for keywords, however, with the
current format NARA can only search on the first keyword.
Each keyword needs to be a _Separate entity on the extract
disk.

#5. Title Field -- NARA is. expanding the title field to cut
down on the number of truncated titles. Does not effect HRG
system which is already 250 characters.

#6. “Identification Number" -- Move date/time ID number to
Comment Section along with box numbers and folder
information (#8).

#7. "Open Criteria" -- Field can be blank. Use only for
special restrictions on documents; unlikely that CIA will
have documents that require using this field. Need to
delete canned statement.
