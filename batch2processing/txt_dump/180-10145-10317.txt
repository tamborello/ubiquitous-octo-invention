Indicates concern for response re: Shaw's connection with
CIA. Can reconstruct contact by Leake, but “since we
cannot determine the nature of DCD's relationship with

. Shaw from our files, we ouwld wppreciate your summarizing
it for us." oe

Synopsis: : ,
File contains reports made by Clay Shaw pursuant to contacts - by
CIA between 1949-1956; memoranda which followed the course of the
Shaw trial and investigation because of alleged CIA. involvement.
CIA tried to determine relationship between Shaw and Permindex or
World Trade Center. There appears to be none.
