cluded that this letter had been accidently removed by the cutting
process applied to page 152 and that its removal resulted from the
‘application of excessive pressure on the cutting tool when the letter
on page 152 was taken out.

. The sample is considered too small for any valid conclusions to
be reached as to the purposes for which the above noted letters were
removed. it {s considered most unlikely that this process of letter
removal has any cryptographic implication.

dad. The Russian “Tourist” portable radio was examined for
‘eryptologic evidence. The radio appears to be a normal receiver and
there was no evidence of its use for any other purpose.

@. The names appearing in Lee's and Marina's address
books were checked, No evidence of cryptologic implication was
found. , ‘ :

Although the results of the examination of the materials provided
by the Commission are essentially negative, further study of these
materials will be made. If any results are obtained, the Commission
wlll be advised, However, it is considered most unlikely that any~
thing beyond what is reported above will be discovered.

Dear Mr. Rankin:

Skilled eryptologists at NSA carefully examined the materials
relating to the Lee Harvey Oswald case provided by the Warren Com-
mission. The results are as follows:

a, A detailed examination of the two dictionaries revealed
no indication of their use for cryptographic purposes.

b. In the correspondence, the Oswald Diary, and the other
docume:t 5 examined there wers no evidences of the use of any type
of cryptography, to include the use of an open code.

c. Certain letters had been removed from pages 150 and 182
of the Russian novel, GLAZA KOTORYE SPRASHIVAYUT, "Questioning

Eyes." Eight letters had apparently been cut from page 152 as follows:

Line 10
Line 11
Line 13
Line 16
Line 24

Line 27

One letter had been removed from page 150; however no significance
