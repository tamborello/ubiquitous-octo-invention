REPORTS WHICH APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ACCURATE. |

:

1. PROBABLY THE MAJOR CHANGE THAT HAS OCCURRED IN CUBA DURING
THE PAST YEAR, TOGETHER WITH THE DECLINING ECONOMIC SITUATION, HAS :
BEEN THE CENTRALIZATION OF DECISION-MAKING POWERS IN ONE MAN, PREWIER
FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, CASTRO REFUSES TO LISTEN TO ADVICE AND IS FOREVER
BYPASSING HIS MINISTERS, CASTRO GETS AN IDEA AND WITHOLT CONSTLTING
ANYONE WILL CALL A TRUSTED OFFICER, ASSIGN HIM THE TASK, AND ORDER

HIM TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO CASTRO, THIS CAUSES TOTAL CONFUSION IN
. | GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES, AND HAS ALSO GIVEN RISE TO PUBLIC CRITICISM

OF CASTRO, SUCH CRITICISM, ALTHOUGH MOSTLY IN A JOKING VEIN, IS 4.
NEW DEVELOPMENT, CASTRO IS AWARE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE BECOMING

CRITICAL, AND HE IS STARTING TO MANEUVER TO REGAIN
GROUND.

2. CASTRO'S INVESTIGATION OF JOAQUIN ORDOQUI MESA WAS THE
AFTERMATH OF AND DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MARCH 1964 TRIAL OF MARCOS
ARMANDO RODRIGUEZ ALFONSO, ORDOQUI WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRO-
CEEDINGS AND HE REFUSED TO LET MATTERS REST. ORDOQUI CONTINUED TO
EXPRESS IRRITATION ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TRIAL HAD BEEN
HAXDLED, AND HIS CRITICAL ATTITUDE CONTRIBUTED TO CASTRO'S BRINGING ‘~
MATTERS TO A HEAD, ,

3, CASTRO'S PRIMARY CONCERN REGARDING THE “OLD GUARD" COMMUN
ISTS IS THAT THEY ARE SO DISLIKED BY THE MASSES, BY KEEPING THEM,
HOWEVER, CASTRO GIVES HIMSELF MANEUVERING GROUND. CASTRO REALIZES
HE MUST act AGAINST THE "OLD GUARD" COMMUNISTS WitH RUSTRAINT IN

ORDER NOT TO CREATE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE SOVIETS, THE LAST
THING CASTRO WANTS IS AN UNCONTROLLED CRISIS EITHER WITH THE SOVIETS

OR WITHIN THE REGIME,
4, CASTRO'S MAJOR PROBLEMS ARE ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL, AND LABOR,
LAzARO PERA GONZALEZ, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CENTRAL DE TRABAJA-
DORES DE CUBS REVOLUCIONARIA (REVOLUTIONARY CUBAN WORKERS' ORCANIZA-
TION, CTC-R) IS SLATED TO BE REMOVED, BUT ONLY CASTRO WILL SAY WHEN,
CARLOS RAFAEL RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTO NACIONAL
DE LA REFORMA AGRARIA (NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AGRARIAN REFORM, INRA)
HAS ALSO HAD HIS PROBLEMS WITH CASTRO, THE INRA IS A "MESS" BUT IT
IS DOUBTFUL THAT ANYONE CAN SUCCEED IN THE JOB, AND IT IS UNLIKELY

THAT CASTRO WILL ESCALATE THE CRISIS BY A MOVE AGAINST RODRIGUEZ AT
THIS TIME, (SOURCE COMMENT: CASTRO ONCE SAID THAT HE WILL NOT
PERMIT HIMSELF TO BE PRESSURED BY ANYONE AND WILY, REPLACE OFFICIALS
ONLY WHEN HE DESIRES TO DO SO, AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 1963 CASTRO
WAS PLANNING TO REMOVE AUGUSTO MARTINEZ SANCHEZ AS MINISTER OF LABOR
AT A CONVENIENT TIME, THUS HIS RECENT ACTION AGAINST MARTINEZ MAY
REPRESENT THE REALIZATION OF A YEAR-OLD INTENTION.) CASTRO‘S
PROBLEMS WITH THE MILITARY HAVE BEEN LESS SERIOUS. ACTION TAKEN
AGAINST MILITARY OFFICERS HAS BEEN ON DISCIPLINARY, NOT POLITICAL
GROUNDS, AS IN THE CASE OF THE DISMISSAL OF CAPTAIN JOSE AGUSTIN
“TINTIN"’ DIAZ-ARGUELLES,
