SA Hugueley advised that in the recent past both
of the Werbells were arrested by BATF Agents as a result
of their selling seven automatic weapons to a BATF under-
cover Agent, in violation of Federal law. The Werbells
won an acquittal in United States District Court (USDC)
of these charges in the recent past.

SA Hugueley continued that in addition to the
above matter, his bureau is currently investigating the
Werbells under the provisions of the Gun Control Act of .
1968, Section 922M. He advised that his bureau recently
reviewed the records of DSC and found discrepancies in.
these records. He explained that the Federal law requires
that anyone having a Class 3 license to export automatic
weapons from the United States is required to be able to

account for every weapon which it has in its inventory or ‘
which it exports, and that it was in this regard that the

Werbells came under scrutiny by the BATF. He continued

that as a result of his investigation, the BATF secured.

a search warrant from the USDC, Northern District of Georgia

(NDGA), Atlanta, Georgia, and subsequent ly seized approxis

mately 3,500 automatic weapons and approximately 1,400

sound suppressors (silencers) from DSC. At this time DSC

has in its inventory only one automatic weapon.

SA Hugueley continued that on December 13, 1974,
the Class 3 license of DSC was due for reissuance. He
explained’ that the BATF must authorize re-issuance of this :
export license but that in view of their continuing inves- ;
tigation, that the BATF has not as of May 22, 1975, renewed
their Class 3 export license. He explained that this pro-
hibits DSC from exporting any weapons from the United States.

SA Hugueley continued that DSC does not manufac-
ture any weapons, that they are merely a wholesaler or a :
broker and due to the recent seizure of all their inventory, ;
and due to the fact that their Class 3 license has not been
renewed to date, the DSC has no inventory whatever for
exportation.

SA Hugueley explained that in 1969 the Werbells
and George Salesky formed the MAC, which was engaged in
the manufacture and export of automatic weapons. In 1972
the Werbells split from MAC and formed the Defense Systems
International (DSI), which only dealt in automatic’ weapons
and was not engaged in their manufacture. At this time
Salesky continued to own MAC. Sometime between 1972 and
the present, the Defense Systems International became known
as the Defense Services Company and is owned by the Werbells
III and IV, and also by Geoffrey B. Werbell.

SA Hugueley said that MAC has cooperated with
BATF completely, that its books have always been found to
be in proper order, and that the BATF has never had reason
to suspect Salesky of any questionable activity.

SA Hugueley continued that the MAC is owned by
the Quantum Corporation and its officers are as follows:

. He stated that Salesky is the President of ac MY wa"
and that R. R. Roby is the Secretary-Treasurer of MAC. He v
said that at present the MAC has in excess of 8,000 auto- g
matic weapons in its inventory, approximately 6,000°9 milli-
meter MAC 10's, approximately 2,500 45 caliber MAC 10's,

and approximately 400 380 caliber MAC ll's.

SA Hugueley further advised that he has'a reli-

able informant who is very closely associated with the
Werbells and that he is aware of their activities. He
said that he is certain that the Werbells have not in the
recent past traveled to Gre Middle East |for the purpose of Gs
displaying or selling weapons or for any other purpose

nd further, that the namesf[Aladdin M. Ai~Payyer]and Cs)

illiam Apikiah] are not known to him. He also pointed
out that to his knowledge no individuals representing
the Graq Government|have been in contact with the Werbells Cs

_ for the purchase o firearms. [| oo

SA Hugueley further advised that in the past year
there has been a steady flow of .MAC 10's to [Saudi Arabia; Csi
a total of approximately 1,000 non-suppressed weapons. :
The MAC is in the process of delivering these weapons at
present. He said that upon request, it would be easy for
him_to determine exactly how many weapons have been sent
to (fhe Saudis\ and on what dates they were shipped ¢ ]

SA Hugueley pointed out that before any Class 3
exporter can sell or export weapons to a foreign government,
permission of the United States Department of State (USDS)
must be secured. -He added that BATF is. not interested in
which foreign government purchases the weapons as long as

“export records are in order, the exporter's Class 3 license
is .valid, and the USDS's permission has been obtained for i
the sale. When all-of these requirements are met, it is :
perfectly legal for the exporter to sell to any’ foreign

government. :
