Special Group

 

 

* The Special Group discussed (1) the possibility of providine sixty

 

thousand dollars from the Cuba budget

(2) a proposal to survéy fW® possibility of establishing a Strike.
base in Nicaragua; (3) ‘the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military
men to CIA. "Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700 .
Cubans is any longer practicable. He said that it had been his understanding that

 

 

 
 

the—current—thinking contemplated..figures_more_on_the_order_of_3.,000." Mr. Barnes

 

 

replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as
a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as
3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed
it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved ina defense, in
addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.
