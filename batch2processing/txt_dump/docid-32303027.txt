On July 21, 1958, PCI (conceal), Credit omnen 4
Manager of the gambling casino at the Hotel Nacienal, advised that
inquiry by him has failed to develop any information that the
MANNARINOS presently have any gambling interests in Cuba. Source
said that sometime ago SAM MANNARINO told him that he had lost a
large sum of money in Cuba in the, old Sans Souci Night Club operation
and that he had no intention of investing more mouey in gambling
eperations in Cuba in the near future. Source noted that in the
past the MANNARINOS have shipped slot machines to Cuba. Source
believed that most of these shipments have been through ALBERTO
ARDURA MOYA. Source noted that ARDURA is the “bag man" for
ROBERTO FERNANDEZ MIRANDA, the brother-in-law of Cuban President,
FULGENCIO BATISTA. Source said that since FERNANDEZ MIRANDA receives \
50% of the “take" from al1 slot machines operating in Cuba, ARDURA 4
usually is the individual to whom slot machines are experted from
the United States. Source said this is done by ARDURA to insure
control of the slot machines.
