Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
Re: Gambling Activities ~ Bahamas SECRET,

Date

Because of the efforts of the British authorities
to involve the FBI in the open Commission of Inquiry
hearings being conducted in the Bahamas on all casino
gambling operations, we are not furnishing any type of
information to British authorities pertaining to such
gambling activities. It would appear, however, that we
should advise the representative of MI-5 in this instance
that we are unable to determine from identifying information
available to us whether J. Finke and Samuel Benton may be
identical (4) oa

ACTION:

If you approve, attached isra blind memorandum
advising (MI-5 that it cannot be determined from the
information presently at hand if J. Finke is identical with

- Samuel Benton |, A brief description of Benton is included.
