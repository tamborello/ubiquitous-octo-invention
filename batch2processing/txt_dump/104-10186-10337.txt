Washington, D,-C.
(February 1965) — FIELD REPORT NO.
THIS 15 UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT 1S TENTATIVE.

A former Cuban IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelligence
Service until April 1964. -

Although there are many members of the Direccion General de-
Intelligencia (General Directorate of Intelligence + DGI) who

_ appear interested tn and favorable toward:.the Communist ‘Party,
Source knows cf cnly three persons who are actually members:”
Saul GONZALEZ, aisas"Denis"; Manuel VEGA Perez, alias "Marcos
Viera"; and Felix SUAREZ, alias “Federico Santiesteban",
SUAREZ wis a sert cf pelitical adviser in the DGI cperations
departments, but insisted he was not a commissar, but, rather,
a@ person in charge. Although Source and the other officers
would tease SUAREZ by calling him "Comisario", SUAREZ greatly
resented the term and actually physically attacked Source for
doing so, Every Saturday morning at 8:50, SUAREZ held a
political indoctrination meeting which’ all personnel were
supposed te attend Scurce was habitually late to these 4
sessions, and althcugh he was given penalties for his obvious
disaffection, he never paid any attention to them. The DGT
personnel Source knew were perfectly willing to talk politics

- among themselves but in a rather desultory way; the discussions
never went on very long.

Apparently during 1962, there had been considerable sentiment
for Anibal ESCALANTE and his faction, the Partido Socialista
Popular (PSP), but in 1964, the PSP group was disrupted and

the real Yoyalty was to Fidel CASTRO rather than to the Party.
