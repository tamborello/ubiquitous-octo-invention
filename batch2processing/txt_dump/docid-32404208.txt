HW 53217

 

Following is for PAI's background should questions be raised
about inconsistencies in the redactions of the JFK
documents:

- There are many duplicate documents, which may not have
been sanitized exactly the same way by different reviewers
in every instance. .

- Our procedures for declassification evolved over the
past year, so that more information was released in
documents reviewed later compared to documents reviewed
earlier.

- The physical quality of many documents is poor.

- Some documents were sanitized elsewhere in the Agency
earlier. So we were dealing often with redacting materials
already sanitized for other reasons e.g., for release to the
House Assassinations Committee.

- Not all the documents released are CIA documents. Many
are press items, third agency.

- We will be doing followup review of the documents
after the 22 August deadline to reconcile inconsistencies.
