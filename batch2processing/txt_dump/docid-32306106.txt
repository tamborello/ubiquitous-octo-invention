LCN figures behind the scenes ‘are afraid ov retaliation on
through murder of some of the Black Muslims may set off

a race riot, This, in turn, would further interfere with

the numbers business; cause local, state and possibly Federal
investigations into the causes of the riot; and, as importantly,
embarrass the politicians,

 

; informant saic the LCN is aware of this situation,
but is leaving the individual numbers operator to get
along as best he can, The individual operator, not having
an "Army" to retaliate, is therefore complying with the
shakedown requests,

 

The situation, however, is growing worse because
the Biack Muslims, feeling the LCN is bowing to their
demands, are making greater demands for “protection money",
When the interference and demands become non-manageable,
the individual operators will. either pe forced out or the
LCN will step in with the necessary force to correct the
situation,

 

 

 

Informant feels the Black Muslims are using
Mafia tactics °~ an "Army" and secrecy, He said the LCN
does not relish the idea of doing combat with the Black
Muslims,

NE 2327-PC denied his: numbers oneration was
experiencing trouble, When asked what specific reaction a
mob boss would have should informant relate the above
problem, informant said the boss would listen attentively,
then state, “You know what has to be done", ‘This evasion
of the problem leaves the individual numbers cperator only
the ehoice of paying the shakedown price because he is in
no position to do battle,
