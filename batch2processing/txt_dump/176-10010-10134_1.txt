RELATIONS WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL

3 cat

1, THE UNITED STATES REGARDS THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL AS
THE CENTRAL, POINT OF CONTACT IN ITS DEALING WITH THE CUBAN
EXILE AND UNDERGROUND ACTIVITY. DR. MIRO CARDONA -~ AS
CHAIRMAN OF THAT COUNCIL. -- HAS THE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE OF
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPLETE OUTLINE
GF THE STRUCTURE OF OUR-FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COUNCIL:

A. BUDGETARY - A BASIC ADMINISTRATIVE BUDGET WILL BE ALLOCATED.
‘THIS WILL BE. SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD’ OF ONE: MILLION |
DOLLARS PER YEAR. THERE, WILL BE CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY IN
THE USE OF THIS MONEY ALLOWED TO THE COUNCIL. DETAILED
ADVANCE JUSTIFICATION WILL NOT BE REQUIRED, BUT COMPLETE.
ACCOUNTING FOR MONIES SPENT WILL BE ESSENTIAL.

ALL OTHER ALLOCATIONS OF MONEY WILL BE ON THE BASIS OF. SPECIFIC
"PROJECTS SUBMITTED BY THE COUNCIL AND APPROVED BY THE UNITED
"STATES... IN THIS CATEGORY VILL FALL MOST OF. THE PROPAGANDA -
ACTIVITIES AND ALL CLANDESTINE ACTIVITIES WITHIN CUBA.

 comesrate OF COUNCIL = THE COUNCIL WILL CONTINUE
TO BROADEN ITS. BASE, ALLOWING ENTRY TO ALL SUBSTANTIAL
EXILE GROUPS WHICH ARE NOT. IDENTIFIED WITH BATISTS OR WITH
confiuNrs. -

 

i)

C., UNDERGROUND ACTIVITIES -

“ts ALL GROUPS WILLING TO WORK WITH THE COUNCIL IN CONNECTION
“WITH THEIR UNDERGROUND ACTIVITIES WILL BE DEALT WITH THROUGH
“DR. MIRO. THIS MEANS THAT THE OPERATING U.S. AGENCY WILL

IMPORTANCE OF THE MAGISTRATES* GROUP. ONE SECTION OF THIS

GROUP. SPLIT OFF AND BACKED PRIO’S CANDIDATE FOR EXILE: -

GOVERNMENT. THIS FACTION HAS STIMULATED A COSTLY PRESS

_ CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE CRC. IN THE TRADE UNION GROUP, A

‘DIVISION OCCURRED TWO DAYS. AGO WITH LEADERS ASSOCI ATED

WITH THE PAST (PRESUMABLY WITH MUJAL) REPLACING DECENT
LEADERS. AS FOR THE STUDENT. GROUP, 7 WAITED UNTIL
OCTOBER 19 TO AGREE TO JOIN THE ORs AND THEN DID SO

‘WITH STIPULATIONS.

A. _ REASONABLE OBS ERV ATI ON ‘COULD BE THAT ITIS"A

: SUSPICIOUS COINCIDENCE THAT, THESE GROUPS WHICH ARE
SUPPOSED TO ENTER THE CRC HAVE RESISTED DOING so AND IN

SOME CASES HAVE ORGANIZED CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE CRC.

NEVERTHELESS ALL THE MAIN ‘GROUPS, EXCEPT MRP AND UD,

HAVE: ‘NOW JOINED UP. THESE TwO GROUPS: CONTINUE TO RECEIVE
DIRECT CIA SUBSIDY. . 7
"AS FOR THE NEW CIA LIAISON OFFICER, I HAVE HAD TWO.

LONG TALKS WITH HIM AND HAVE SUBMITTED OPERATIONAL PLANS |

‘TO HIM. IN A THIRD TALK, HELD TWELVE DAYS. LATER, THIS
“MAN SHOWED HIMSELF EVASIVE AND DID NOT EXPLAIN SATISFACTORILY ~

WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE PLANS» CACC ORDING TO CIA, THE

PLANS REVERTED ‘TO INVASION THINKING ‘AND COLONEL JOHNSON

ACCEPTED: THEM ONLY IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH RAPPORT WITH

MIRO. 1 AM KEPT. IN COMPLETE IGNORANCE ABOUT WHAT Is To
HAPPEN INSIDE CUBA. BUT I KNOW THAT RECRUITING 1S. GOING

ON AMONG STUDENT AND LABOR GROUPS FOR TRAINING. AND
—INFILITRATION-=WE KNOW THIS FROM OUR OWN CONTACTS AND NOT

FROM CTA. IN ADDITION, CIA.SENT A GROUP TO BRAZIL WITHOUT —

CHECKING WITH THE CRC OR, SEEKING THE COUNCIL'S
ADVICE OR INSTRUCTIONS. ALso A CIA AGENT “ACCOMPANTED:

munineitian tanto een MOMCPICM PEAR
NOR ANYTHING WITH WHICH TO CONDUCT THE FIGHT FOR THE ~
LIBERATION OF OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE REALLY NO MORE THAN A
FRONT FOR THE CIAy AND WE WILL ONCE AGAIN BE THE SACRIFICIAL |
VICTIN FOR, THEIR ERRORS. RADIO SWAN CONTINUES AS A CIA
CPERATIONs SANJENIS IS RECRUITING PEOPLE, FREELY OFFERING ARMS
AND MONEY. NATURALLY PEOPLE GO WHERE THEY ARE OFFERED ARMS.
. | IN SUM, THE PAST OF SEPTEMBER 8, WHICH I was RELUCTANT

TO AGREE TO AT THE TIME, HAS NOT BEEN FULFILLED.
STILL, I CAME TO WASHINGTON ON SUNDAY FOR A DINNER AT WHICH.
1 WAS ASSURED THE CIA REPRESENTATIVE IN MIAMI WOULD BE PRESENT.
“ME WAS NOT THERE. CIA CONTINUES ‘TO DO WHAT IT WANTS WITHOUT:
REGARD FOR THE CRC. 1 DON'T THINK THAT CIA-HAS ANYTHING
PERSONAL AGAINST ME. IT IS JUST THAT THEY WISH TO RUN THINGS
AS THEY HAVE DONE BEFOREs THEY ARE DESTROYING THE CRC BY THIS”
ATTITUDE, HENCE MY. DECISI ON-- Now IRREVOCABLE =~ TO RESIGN.
' J] CAN FIGHT AGAINST CASTRO -- AGAINST .THE CORRUPTIONS OF

" THE PAST == AGAINST PRIO -~ AGAINST BATISTA - BUT, IF I

“HAVE TO FIGHT THE CIA ON’ TOP OF ALL THIS, I DECLARE MYSELF
- VANQUISHED. EVEN IF THE PRESENEYSI TUATION IS STRAIGHTENED OUT,
“YT WILL ALL BEGIN AGAIN TOMORROW. THE CIA WILL SIMPLY TRY TO
CREATE A SETUATION TO JUSTIFY 17S PAST ATTITUDES.

GOODWIN: I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL NOT ANNOUNCE YOUR
RESIGNATION UNTIL THE OAS MEETING CDISCUSSING PERUS* RESOLUTION
ON CUBA) ON THURSDAY.

MIRO: YES; -
| GOODWIN: YOUR RESIGNATION WOULD BE A TRAGEDYs BUT, AFTER:
SO MANY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE, I WILL NOT. OFFER You
“ANY MORE PROMISES. BUT GIVE NE 24 HOURS TO SEE.

WHETHER DEFINITE AND POSITIVE ARRANGEMENTS CANNOT BE MADE
TO-IMPROVE THIS SITUATION. IF NECESSARY, I MEAN TO GO TO THE

SECRETARY * OR” TO “THE PRESIDENT.
GY THURSDAY DICK GOODWIN ASKED ME TO COME TO HIS OFFICE
TO HEAR MIRG’S ACCOUNT OF THE BERLE-SCHLESINGER MISSION °
TO NEW YORK BEFORE THE INVASION OF CUBA. US NEWS AND
WORLD REPORT HAD REPRINTED A STORY CLAIMING THAT THE CUBAN
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL HAD NEVER BEEN TOLD THERE WOULD BE
NO US MILITARY SUPPORT. IN A LETTER TO US NEWS, °
STEWART’ ALSOP HAD DENIED THIS, SAYING THAT SCHLESINGER
AND BERLE HAD® INFORMED MIRO OF THIS AND HAD ASSUMED. THAT.
HE IN TURN HAD INFORMED: THE COUNCIL, MIRO NOW CLAIMED -
“TO GOODWIN: AND ME THAT BERLE IN A DINNER AT HIS GEORGETOWN
HOUSE HAD PROMISED THAT 15,000 US TROOPS WOULD BE: AVAILABLE
TO HELP THE CUBANS, AND THAT HE HAD MADE CLEAR AT, THE
CENTURY CLUB LUNCHEON THAT NOTHING WE WERE SAYING
SUPERSEDED THAT PROMISE. MIRO ACCORDINGLY WENT AWAY FROM
THAT LUNCHEON, HE NOW SAYS,’ CONVINCED THAT,, DESPITE WHAT
THE PRESIDENT HAD SAID AT HIS PRESS. CONFERENCE AND
DESPITE WHAT WE HAD SAID. TO HIN THEN, THE INVASION WOULD
STILL GET DIRECT US MILITARY SUPPORT.
THIS. ALL SEEMS FANTASY TO ME, SINCE I CANNOT IMAGINE
BERLE MAKING ANY SUCH ASSURANCES CUNLESS HE SUPPOSED
“THAT, ONCE THE INVASION STARTED, THE MARINES WOULD BE -
“DRAGGED IN, REGARDLESS OF ALL INTENTIONS. TO THE CONTRARY).
HOWEVER, ONE MEMORY SUGGESTS THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
A GENUINE MISUNDERSTANDING. I CAN RECALL THAT TRACY BERNES oS nee ee
CALLED HE THE NEXT. DAY AND ASKED WHETHER BERLE HAD SAID os eo ee
THING ABOUT 15,000 TROOPS=- THAT MIRO HAD COME AWAY. et
FROMTHE LUNCH WITH SOE IMPRESSION THAT US ‘TROOPS MIGHT

EXPLICIT US COMI THENT TO A NEW INVASION. “1 CANNOT ASK -
MY PEOPLE,” HE SAID, "TO ENGAGE IN UNDERGROUND WORK AND
IN SABOTAGE UNLESS I. KNOW DEFINITELY THAT THESE ACTIONS
ARE LEADING TO/CLEARLY DEFINED AND AGREED-ON CLIMAX.

I CANNOT GO AS CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL UNLESS THERE, IS

A CLEAR COMMI THENT THAT THE US WILL PARTICIPATE IN aN
EVENTUAL INVASION OF CUBA. I HAVE BEEN DELUGED WITH PLEAS
FROM WIDOWS AND FAMILIES OF THOSE vio TOOK PART IN THE
APRIL TRAGEDY. MY OWN SON IS IN: CASTRO'S PRISONS. THE’
PROGRAM “YOU. “ARE ‘PRESENTING “TO ME ‘IS A PROLOGUE AND
NOTHING MORE. THERE 1S NO POINT IN A PROLOGUE UNLESS ONE ©
1s SURE WHAT THE CONCLUSION WILL BE.” ' .

“GOODWIN: “WE UNDERSTAND AND SYMPATHIZE WITH DR MIRO'S —
POSITION. WE SHARE HIS DESIRE FOR AN OVERTHROW OF THE
CASTRO REGIME. WE HAVE PREPARED A PROGRAM OF ACTION TO
THAT END. BUT WE CANNOT CONMIT THE US GOVERNMENT TO SOMETHING —

“80 FAR-REACHING AS AN INVASION OF CUBA IN THE INDEFINITE
FUTURE. WILITARY ACTION IN THE FUTURE MAY OR WAY NOT
“BE POSSIBLE OR NECESSARY. BUT, “IF WE CONTINUE TO WORK
TOGETHER-=-AND: I HOPE WE CAN=+-IT MUST BE ON THE BASIS OF

_ THE SAME aoALs AND THE SAME HOPES. WE MUST DO ALL WE. CAN.

IN THE INTERESTS OF THE CAUSE FOR WHICH WE FIGHT. A COMMITMENT
FOR THE INDEFINITE FUTURE UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH NO ONE:
CAN BE ‘VISE ENOUGH TO FORESEE CANNOT BE MADE AT THIS TIME)” -

 

ihre: “I UNDERSTAND YOUR VIEW---YOU MUST UNDERSTAND
‘MINE, IF THERE CAN BE NO COMMITMENT. I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE —
BUT TO PREPARE A LETTER TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAYING THAT
1 CANNOT ‘CONTINUE AS HEAD OF THE COUNCIL. THE PROGRAM IS
INADEQUATE BOTH BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ULTIMATE

IF THERE 1S ANYTHING UNSATISFACTORY IN THE MEMORANDUM, |
WE CAN DISCUSS IT. THIS MEMORANDUM REPRESENTS AN ATTEMPT
IN GOOD FAITH TO MEET THE POINTS YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY
‘NADE TO US." te

MIRO: “ I STILL FEEL THAT THE ARRANGEMENT FOR
PROPAGANDA IS UNSATISF ACTORY---THAT EVEN IF I COULD INFLUENCE.
11S BROAD ORIENTATION, IT WOULD STILL NOT BE WELL
“PREPARED. ALSO 1 WOULD HAVE No CONTROL OVER A PORTION OF
THE CLANDESTINE ACTIVITIES. ONCE OTHER GROUPS LEARN THEY
CAN BYPASS’ THE COUNCIL AND GET DIRECT ASSISTANCE FROM THE

“US GOVERNMENT, THE RESULT WILL BE A PROLIFERATION
‘OF GROUPS WHICH WILL BE DAMAGING. BOTH TO PRESENT OPERATIONS
AND TO THE, POLITICAL FUTURE OF CUBA. THESE THINGS, ON.
TOP OF A LACK OF FAITH IN THE ULTIMATE END, LEAD ME TO
FEEL NEGATIVE ABOUT PROCEEDING ON ‘THIS BASIS, I HAVE
EXPRESSED MY VIEWS. NOW I WILL GO TO BALTIMORE TO MEDITATE
MY FINAL DECISION. MY LETTER WILL BE COURTEOUS AND

RESPECTFUL, BUT MY PRESENT CONVICTION Is THAT MY RESPONSE
MUST BE A RESIGNATION.”
GOODWIN: " THERE IS NO ‘QUESTION THAT THE FIGHT WILL

GO ON, THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER WE CAN ‘conpuct IT
WITH DR WIRO'S INDISPENSABLE COOPERATION.”
