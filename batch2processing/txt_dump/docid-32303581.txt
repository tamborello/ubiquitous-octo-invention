CITIZENSHIP; The San Francisco Police Department reports
subject was born in Georgia. Therefore,
he is probably a U. S. citizen.

BIOGRAPHICAL DATA: Confidential Informant SF-296 reports
that a member of the Communist Party from September 1936 to February
1937 had occasion to view the records of the Newspaper Guild Fraction
of theCommunist Party, and among the names listed was the name of
the subject, who is identified as holding a position at the PEOPLES
WORLD newspaper, a Communist organ. According to this informant,
subject attended Communist Party meetings of the Newspaper Guild
Fraction during the time from September 1936 to February 1937 while
this informant was a member of the Party.

Confidential Informant SF-296 further advises that subject's
wife MERLE PITTMAN, is believed white, and quit her position at the
C.1.0. to sccept a position at the state headquarters of the Communist
Party, 121 Haight Street, San Francisco.

Confidential Informant SF-2 ‘advised that subject, a negro,
is employed as Foreign Editor of the PEOPLES WORLD newspaper, West
Coast Communist organ, and stated that he and his wife reside at 1667
Hyde Street. This informant reports thet subject's wife, MERLE
PITTMAN, is believed to be employed as a stenographer at the offices
of Gladstein, Grossman, Margolis & Sawyer, local Communist attorneys

" who are defending HARRY BRIDGES.

This informant, SF-2, further states that subject asso=
ciates with WILLIAM SCHNEIDERMANN, Secretary of the 13th District
of the Communist Party for the State of California; that subject met
with JAMES W. FORD, Vice-Presidential candidate of the Communist Farty
in Los Angeles, California in October 1940. The 1940 register of
Voters in the general election reflects that subject's wife, Mrs.
MERLE PITTMAN, residing at 1028 Montgomery Street, is a registered
voter of the Communist Party. This lists her cecupation as a steno-
grapher.

A San Francisco newspaper recently carried an article —
which stated that "Vanessi's" a prominent restaurant, refused to
seat a mixed party of white and black, which party included the
singer PAUL ROBSON, and others who consisted of JOHN PITTMAN, a negro,
a white woman also named PITTMAN, as being part of the party. It is
pelieved that this was JOHN PITTMAN 's wife, MERLE PITTMAN, and the
Communist attorneys are now suing “Vanessi's" restaurahte
