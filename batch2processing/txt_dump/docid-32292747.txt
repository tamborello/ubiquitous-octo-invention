17. Remarks (By SAC):

i

{Tt is recommended that this surveillance be maintained
for an additional period of 90 days and such will be done UACB.
Attention is drawn to the fact that although the general quality
and quantity of information received from this source has greatly
decreased, the source continues to be active to some extent due to
infrequent visits by Chicago top hoodlums to Celano's and due to
conversations held by Celano with others concerning Chicago top
hoodlums and their associates and activities. In addition, there is
no expense involved in monitoring this source in that the same
| employees who monitor the other surveillances on the same subject
easily monitor this source. Further, it does not appear that there is
any particular risk involving the security of this source at Celano's,
' except that risk which would be inherent in making an entry to
i retrieve the source.
