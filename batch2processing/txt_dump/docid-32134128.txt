NOTE: A man named John Bowen sat next to the subject during the
| bus trip from Texas to Mexico City on 9-26, 27-63, Bowen has been
i identified. as Albert Osborne, born 11-12-88 in Grimsby, England.
: He is a self-ordained Baptist minister who runs a mission in Mexico

and appears to be a con man. He was interviewed in Nashville 3-3-64
: at which time he admitted furnishing false info as to his identity
; . and denied any knowledge of Oswald or being a passenger on the above
bus. We have conducted considerable investigation and have established
that Osborne was sitting next to the subject on the bus on the above-
mentioned trip and to pursue this point further will not furnish us
any additional productive data, It does not appear that Osborne has
any personal knowledge relating to Oswald or any connection with
Oswald, His hesitancy and vagueness during interview is atributable
to the fact that he is a con man operating a missionary in Texmelucan
and is soliciting funds for this missionary under the name of Osborne
and Bowen. He recently advised one of the contributors that Bowen
had been his associate in the operation of the mission and had died
and so ws Mot to lose money Osborne arranged with banking authorities.
for payments in, both the name of Osborne and Bowen. By letter 3-30-64
we furnished the Commission the copy of the Ballas report and YUE Y od
suggested it. may desire to subpoena Osborne and place him under oath
in view of the fact that he has continually lied to us. We also
advised INS and the Chief Postal Inspector by letters 3-30-64 as

(eo indicated in the outgoing. Legat, Ottawa, bad been requested to obtai

 

all data available concerning Osborne from}|RCMP., RCMP{had little data
of value and requested additional data of an identifying nature from
us. There is no further need to continue the Osborne aspect of this
investigation in that we have resolved he has no connection with
Oswald, ; :
