It is not clear from the comment whether the term "too dangerous" |
was intended to indicate that there might be some type of physical
violence, or whether it was felt that from a propaganda and publicity
point of view it would be dangerous to have persons present who could
be identified as representatives of the present Cuban government Y& |} U

. On the basis of other information, it-appears: that the latter
is probably the case. The Washington Field Office,-.however, was .
instructed to pass on to a reliable contact at the Capitol Police 2,) i
Force the substance of the above information, in general terms to
protect the source. State has also been telephonically advised.
