Re New York teletype to New Haven 7/7/64,

    
   

Confidential sources in the New Haven Division were contacted in
connection with individuals who might attend the funeral of
ROCCO FISCHETTI and no information was obtained indicating that
any umbrworld associate would attend the funeral,

NH 415-C-TE, characterized as a close associate of leading
hoodlums in Conn. and New York areas, including members of La
Cosa Nostra, advised that in his estimation ROCCO FISCHETTI

was a "nothing" and that his brother JOSEPH was the big man in
the rackets.
