Contact maintained with Israel National Police (INP) has i
revealed that agency's reluctance to place stops for individuals
entering or leaving the country, since INP personnel. utilized at the
border control sections of international entry points: are not in a
position to maintain and appropriately utilize a system of stops when ; I
these numbers become in any way extensive. INP, however, is willing :
to place a "stop'' in their border control records at INP Headquarters i
in Jerusalem, so that when the frontier notification of a departure
or entry reaches border control records at INP Headquarters in Jerusalem,
a notation in the file will alert the person filing the departure or
entry notification to call this action to the attention of his superior.
This process would result in the stop being effective anywhere from a

week to ten days following the éparture or entry of an individual of C0 )

interest. For this reason, no stop was placed on subject OGUL, but,
because of his departure from Israel and the possibility of MEDLEVINE
following suit, INP is being requested to place a stop on MEDLEVINE. :
