File No. ., February 1, 1960

ROBERT BERNARD BAKER, also known as;
EDWARD F, WEINHEIMER
LABOR MANAGEMENT RELATIONS ACT 1947,
‘INVESTIGATIVE MATTER; PERJURY-:
7 |
On January 25, 1960, Plato Cacheris and Abraham
Poretz, Department of Justice attorneys, held a conference
concerning the accounting examination of the records of
Exhibitors Service Company with Special Agent Edward Ww,
Pennypacker. During the conference reference was made to
-the fact that the moneys sent by the company to Weinheimer
were transmitted via the minimum air mail and regular mail
postal rates. In this connection, Cacheris and Poretz
requested that consideration be given to a test being made
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether
twenty used bilis of any denomination and a business size
envelope, as well as a letter size piece of paper or a
~ small envelope either of which might have been utilized
as enclosures with the money, could have been sent through
the mails for the minimum postal rates.

 

Inasmuch as such a determination would be a
-matter primarily a function of the postal authorities and
not the Federal Bureau of Investigation, no action in this
regard is being taken in absence of any further request.
