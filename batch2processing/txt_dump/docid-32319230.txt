Dear Ms. Keeley:

This is in response to your letter dated May 30, 1997, requesting Commission review of
portions of one unclassified FBI document (FBI File No. 105-100081-155, MM Report, dated
12/18/64, two pages consisting of pages one and four of the document) and of one FBI
document classified SECRET (FBI File No. 105-100081-81, HQ Airtel, dated 04/23/63, two
pages consisting of pages one and two of the document). You indicated that the review was
being sought to determine whether any information contained in the designated portions
should be deleted prior to permanent transfer of the documents to the National Archives. You
ask that we cite the relevant provisions of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act (JFKARCA) with regard to any deletions deemed appropriate and advise you
whether classification is still warranted. For internal procedural Commission accounting
purposes, your request was handled as a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the
above number assigned.

We have reviewed the portions of the documents referred to above and have determined that
no deletions are necessary or appropriate. With regard to classification, we do not see any
need for the portions of the SECRET document to be classified. We note, however, that the
Commission does not have original classification authority, but only derivative authority
based on prior classification actions by other agencies. Thus, we defer to the FBI regarding
any continuing need to maintain SECRET or other classification on the one classified
document referred to above. All of the documents sent to us are being returned and are

enclosed. 64 Ce HGe 10a F205 ~ - E36

Sincerely,
