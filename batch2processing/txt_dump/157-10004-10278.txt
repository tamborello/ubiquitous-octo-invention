January 7, 1971

Mr. Robert A. Maheu
120 Rosemary Lane
Las Vegas, Nevada

Dear Bob:

In accordance with our recent phone conversation, I offer this letter of
resignation to Robert A. Maheu Associates, effective December 31, 1970.

I appreciated your understanding for my resigning in order to accept more
' challenging opportunities over the years. Tenure with you was more than
rewarding, however.

 

Because of devaluation last year, the cashable value will be less than
the $10, 000 originally deposited. Also, enclosed is the blank check
which you signed and returned to Jaime Duran.

ig Enclosed is a Sucre check drawn from First National City Bank

In reviewing salary deposits, I find additional amounts due to me and
shall notify you when I determine exactly what is payable. I shall de-
duct the $500 I withdrew which you deposited to Bank of America

I want to express my appreciation for your kind considerations during my
years with Robert A. Maheu Associates and I hope we shall meet again
in the future.

My sincere regards to you, your family, Peter, Richard Ellis, and Ceil
Nolan. I wish you much success for the future.

Sincerely,

: Nc
