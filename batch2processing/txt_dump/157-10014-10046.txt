to some extent on the Soviet Union. This was in a period of tim
where the Eastern European satellites were expanding théir

Presence in Latin America. In my duties in the Eastern European

i Division, T was responsible for gettina this nragram ctoing in

Latin America, so I did have an extensive exposure to Latin

America: in the period '60 to "62, as I recall those dates.

. :

The accuracy of those dates can he checked from my official
travel records, and so on.

Mr. Baron. During that period of time you were actually
in Latin America helping to set up this program?

Mr. Halley. No, I was stationed in Washington, but I
travelled to Latin Amarica during this particular period of
time. |

Mr. Baron. Did you travel to Cuba at any point during the
course of that operation?

Mr. Halley. “Not specifically. I think 1 transitted Cuba
on air stops being routed to various countries. I think I was
at one or two Cuban airfields, but simply in transit.

Mr. Baron. Not long enough even to talk to the peopls at

‘the Station in Cuba?

Mr. Halley. No, I had no contact at any time with the
Havana Station.

Mr. Baron. Did you pick up, during this period of time,
a general Sense of the attitude of Latin American governments

toward the Castro government? Could you characterize that

attitude, if you dia?

Mr. Halley. I certainly was aware, I think, of the broad
political trend in the Hemisphere at that time, my interest was
much more narrowly focused at that time on the Eastern European
targets, and on the Soviet target, and I was not certainly
Specializing in Cuban affairs at that juncture.

Mr. Baron. Cuba was not viewed at that juncture as part of
the Soviet target, as a Soviet satellite?

Mr. Halley. No, it was not.

Mr. Baron. Coming then to February of '62, is that the
point at which you joined the JMWAVE Station in Miami?

Mr. Halley. No. When I first entered into this survey,
it was to do this on a TDY basis, temporary duty assignment,
to complete a report on my findings, to report those at that
particular juncture to Mr. Harvey who was the head of the Task
Force that was attempting to expand intelligence coverage of
Cuba and I was not assigned to the station at that particular
point in time.

Mr. Baron. At what point did you join the JMWAVE Station?

Mr. Halley. Shortly after having completed this survey.
These dates are blurred now because the survey soon turned into
@ permanent assignment. I would have to check the exact dates
from my service records, but after having completed the survey
report, shortly thereafter I was asked to go to Miami to become

permanently assigned to the station in Miami. I do not recall

is that correct?

Mr. Halley. That is correct.

I want to qualify that. Undoubtedly, there wera some
actions that were being conducted in the Eastern European area
that reflected on Cuba, but I was not involved in the Bay of Pigs
Operation. I was not fully focused on Cuban operations until
approximately February of 1962.

Mr. Baron. At what point. did you join the Agency?

Mr. Halley. I joined the Agency originally in 1951.

Mr. Baron. In a very general way, can you describe the
nature of your activities at the Agency prior to February of '62P

Mr. Halley. When I was first assiqned to the Agency, I was
an Army officer on active duty. I went through the usual Agency
training program. I was assigned to Eastern European activities
where I originally was focused on Polish and German operations.

I subsequently served from 1952 to 1959 in Germany.‘.In the
course of that service, I spent most of my time working on the
Eastern European satellites, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

Romania, Bulgaria. In addition, I was involved on occasion in

‘Mr. Baron. Did you have any involvement in Latin American

affairs prior to February of '62?

Mr. Hallay. Yes. In the period 1960-62, I.was‘responsible

for setting up operational activity in Latin America that

was targetted more explicitly on the Fastern European satellites{

to this conversation going on the record,

Let us: begin then with ‘soma vary‘ broad questions: © -:-
about your background in the Agency. Can you tell me what you
Were doing in the Agency prior to your involvement with the
IMWAVE station?

Mr. Halley. I became involved with the Cuban affair in
approximately February of 1962. At that time, I was in Head-
quarters. T was Chiet of Foreiqn Intelligence Activities for the
Eastern European Division. I was asked to be raleased from thos
duties to conduct a survey of the opportunities for running

intelligence operations against Cuba. I was released from those

against Cuba.
Mr. Baron. Your position as Chief of Foreign Intelligence
for Eastern Europe did not involve Cuba in any way? -That was

your last position before you became involved in Cuban affairs,
