7. General Carter reported on CIA's contacts with Pan American
regarding its Havana flights, He said that the company had asked

. the Agency to buy its blocked pesos at a one-for-one rate at a scale
an : of $140,000 a month retroactive to last May lst. He said that in the
: face of this proposal, CIA had agreed to buy $200,000 worth, provided
po _ Pan American makes no move at this time to discontinue its service.
i He, said there were assurances that no 2 suct> move would be made before:
October Ist at the earliest. :

i

| . After some discussion, the Group agreed that it is ‘highly

; ' desirable to maintain this service. On theother hand, it appears
“that Pan American's estimates of the amount of money it is losing and

| : the amount of subsidy required to break even.are apparently excessive,

i . General Carter undertook to lcok into the possibility, suggested by

i the Attorney General, that Par American could lower its quoted fare,

inasmuch as the company is not getting the benefit of the $20 now in

any case. .

; : It was generally agreed that government operation of this
i , service would be just as expersive as having Pan American continue it.

8. The Attorney General raised the question of actions by

Cuban exile students against the Castro regime. He recognized, as did

: . the rest of the Group, the fact that these activities can serve as a

: . “cover for future 'U.S,-sponsored operations. “On the ‘other “hand, it was
-recognized equally that bad publicity could result. It was suggested

Q . ' that CLA might talk to selected students and spread the idea that any

i active operations planned by them must in fact be reasonable and worth-

, while ones, and to leave the idea that irresponsible actions might

lead to trouble for them in the future. -
