Stanleyville, and he was imprisoned. The central government of
the Congo transferred Lumumba on January 17, 1961 to the custody
of authorities in the province of Katanga, which was asserting its
own independence at that time. Several weeks later, the Katangese
authorities announced Lumumba's death.

There are various accounts of the circumstances and timing
of Lumumba's death. The United Nations investigation of the inci-
dent concluded that Lumumba was killed on January 17.*

Shortly after the Congolese declaration of independence
from Belgium on June 30, 1960, the-CIA assigned a new bhies of|
Station to the Congo, The \chief of| Station said that the briefings
he received at CIA headquarters in preparation for his departure
contained no discussion of the possibility of assassinating Patrice
Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 8). On his brief return to head-
quarters in connection with Lumumba's visit to Washington in late
July, the thief of|station again heard no discussion of assassi-
nating Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 9).

During August, great concern about Lumumba's political
strength in the Congo was growing among the foreign policy-makers
of the Eisenhower Administration.** This concern was nurtured

Bronson Tweedy, then Chief of the Africa Division of CIA's clan-

Department approval for the proposed operation based upon "OUR
BELIEF LUMUMBA MUST BE REMOVED IF POSSIBLE" (CIA cable (out 59741),

Director of CIA's covert operations branch, signed a follow-up
cable to Leopoldville: “YOU ARE AUTHORIZED PROCEED WITH OPERATION"
(CIA Cable OUT 59959, Director to Leopoldville, 8/19/60).

1. Introduction

The Committee has received solid evidence of a CIA
plot to assassinate Patrice Lumumba. The plot proceeded to
the point where lethal substances and instruments specifically
intended for use in an assassination were placed in the hands
of the CIA knies of [station in Leopoldville by an Agency
sclentist.

' Although these instruments of assassination were never
used, a number of questions are presented by the Lumumba case
which reflect general issues that run throughout the Committee's
assassination inquiry. First, did CIA officers and operatives |

(.. in the Congo take steps to attempt the assassination of Lumumba?

Second, how high in the United States government was the
source of authorization for the CIA assassination plot? Finally,
was the CIA connected in any way to the events that actually led
to the death of Lumumba while in Congolese custody?

A thread of historical background is necessary to weave these
broad questions together with the documents and testimony re-

ceived by the Committee.

that B-1 had given AMLASH-1 a silencer and that AMLASH-1 had
“small, highly concentrated explosives." On February 11, 1965
the Station cabled that AMLASH-1 would soon receive "one
‘pistol with silencer and one FAL rifle with a silencer from B-l's
secretary" (I.G., p. 103). A subsequent cable reported that
"B-1 had three packages of special items made up by his technical
people and delivered to amaszf ——iz., Pp. 103

In June 1965, CI# terminated all contact with
AMLASH-1 and his associates because of reports that his activities

were widely known (I.G., pp. 104-105).

 

"4k, Bel is to be in Cuba one week vefore the elimination
of Fidel, but no one, including AM/LASH-1 will know
B-1l's location.

"5S. B-1 is to arrange for recongition by at least five Latin
American countries as soon as Fidel is neutralized and
a junta is formed. This junta will be established even
though Raul Castro and Che Guevara may still be alive
and may still be in control of the part of the country.
This is the reason AM/LASH~1 requested that B-1 be able
to establish some control over one of the provinces so
that the junta can be formed in that location.

"6. One month to the day before the neutralization of Fidel,
B-1 will increase the number of commando attacks to a
maximum in order to raise the spirit and morale of the
people inside Cuba. In all communiques, in all radio
messages, in all propaganda put out by B-1 he must relate
that the raid was possible thanks to the information
received from clandestine sources inside Cuba and from
the clandestine underground apparatus directed by "PT,
This will be AM/LASH-1's war name."

taken during the Bay of Pigs operation) present Castro with a
contaminated diving suit* (Colby, 5/21, pp. 38-39).

The Inspector General's Report dates this
operation in January 1963, when Fitzgerald replaced Harvey as
Chief of Task Force W, although it is unclear whether Harvey or
Fitzgerald conceived of the plan (I.G., p. 75). It is likely
that the activity took place earlier, since Donovan had completed
his negotiations by the middle of January 1963. Helms characterized
the plan as "cockeyed" (Helms, 6/13, p. 135).

TSD bought a diving suit, dusted the inside
with a fungus that would produce a chronic skin disease (Madura
foot), and contaminated the breathing apparatus with a tubercule
bacillus (I.G., p. 75). The Inspector General's Report states
that the plan was abandoned because Donovan gave Castro a different

diving suit on his own initiative (I.G., p. 75). Helms testified

that the diving suit never left the laboratory (Helms, 6/13, p. ae

In March 1961, an officer of the Mexico
City CIA station met with a highly-placed Cuban official to determine
if he would cooperate in efforts against the Castro regime (I.G.,
