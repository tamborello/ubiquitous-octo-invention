JFK~Law 11(a

 

by MM 2462-PCI.

MM 2462-PCI is a commercial pilot and presently
flies GREENFIELD to Vero Beach, Florida where GREENFIELD
is engaged in an oyster and clam meat business. MM 2462-PCI
advised that he saw DAVE YARAS in GREENFIELD's office
twice and both times YARAS was accompanied by MAX
ROTHFIELD. ROTHFIELD invested in Meter Maid Industries
in return for 70,000 shares of stock which GREENFIELD
gave him. -ROTHFIELD was also investing $25,000 innthe
now defunct First American Investment Fund. The fund
was located in the Cayman Islands and was managed by .
BERNARD HOROWTTZ.

ROTHFIELD's former address is 5801 Sheridan
Road, Chicago, Illinois. He was Vice-President of AMCO
Industries of Chicago for ten years. He was born in
1914 and married to CLARETA. He has two children and
his last known address is 1857 Gulf-To-Bay Boulevard,
Clearwater, Florida. MM 2462-PCI feels that ROTHFIELD
is a go-between for YARAS and GREENFIELD.

On January 11, 1972, ELLEN GREENFIELD, wife of
STEWART GREENFIELD, as Vice-President of Whirl-O-Wash,
Incorporated, filed an affidavit in Bankruptcy Court
listing the ten largest creditors of the company.
