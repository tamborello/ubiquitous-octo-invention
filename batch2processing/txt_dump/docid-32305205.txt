and’ a companion - ‘loan of $240,000,/00 was’ made to The Alvin

principals, subordination agreements ; ete. On April 7,:1960,-
additional loans of $75000,00. each were. granted to the “two

_-¥elease of the claims of PB.and other secured creditors

against the bankrupt. ‘estate and “$50; 000.00 in cash’ from

Port: Colborne Quarries, Ltd.), PB then obtained the two:

- notes for $700,000.00 and $100 000,00. from Port ‘Colborne.
Quarries, Ltd... ‘because of ‘the ‘bank's claim against the
bankrupt estate. It is believed that the bank's supple-
mental claim filed with the trustee in bankruptcy included
the advances of . the funds of the JANEWAY group and interest
thereon cand that bank thus. has: accountability - to this
group for. the ‘proceeds | ‘received ‘in the settlement of. claims.

  

Although the appraised value of. the. only! security

‘internal operating organization. Many -of. PB's staff were not

DETAILS:

'. he following investigation was’ conducted concerning
alleged irregularities, disclosed by a Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) examination, of Public Bank, Detroit, in —
regard to certain loans to the Alvin Naiman Corporation ($50,000.00
on October 16, 1959, $240,000.00 on October 24, 1959, and $75,000.00
on April 7, 1960); to Niagara Crushed Stone (Humberstone), Ltd.

($240, 000,00 on October 24, ‘1959, and $75,000.00 on April 7, 1960yand
to Vendorama of: Ohio, Inc., ($50, 000,00 on October 3, 1960) ; .

At the request of Department Attorney WILLIAM FRENCH,
this investigation has been concentrated upon the alleged
irregularities in regard to the above-mentioned. loans; and
other alleged irregularities disclosed in the FDIC examination are
to be referred. to the United States Attormey for prosecutive con-
sideration after instant investigation has developed the facts as
toa possible \conspiracy in regard to these loans and the involve-
ment of the various subjects. Mr. FRENCH indicated that the other
-alleged irregularities reported by FDIC would be made the subject
of separate cases but he does not desire that these cases be
opened at this time and will advise at a later date when he
considers it appropriate that these matters be discussed with
the United States Attorney.

,

During the period of this report there were frequent
contacts with Mr. FRENCH, who advised as to additional information
received by the Department of Justice and who was informed of the
current results of this investigation.

On September 12, 1962, a detailed discussion was had
with Mr. FRENCH regarding the information developed to date.
“Emphasis was placed by Mr. FRENCH om the need for, determining
what information was availabié at Public Bank regarding the
financial condition of the Alvin Naimam Corporation, Niagara
Crushed Stone (Humberstone) , Ltd, and Vendorama of Ohio at the
time loans were made to those companies by Public Bank in 1959
and 1960. Such information is considered essential by Mr. FRENCH
-in determining whether the granting of these loans constituted

‘misapplications of bank funds in violation of. Section 656, Title

18, United States Code. Mr. FRENCH desired that this phase of
the investigation be given early attention, together with inter-
viewing PAUL P. YODER, Jr., as to his knowledge concerning
financial data made available to Public Bank preliminary to.
granting these loans, Mr. FRENCH indicated that upon completion

of the above inquiries and review of material accumulated from _
various sources, he expected to have a further detailed discussion
as to the other phases of. investigation which he desires to be
gone into, (Beginning in October, 1962, and continuing to the
present time, Mr. FRENCH has béen engaged in the preparation

and trial of another involved matter in United States District
Court, Detroit.) :

_ On August 29, 1962, Mr. FRENCH advised that the Department
of Justice had received information indicating that. HERBERT L. —
GROSBERG of Detroit probably was in Chicago, Illinois, on June
14,.15 and 16, 1959, and stayed at the Shoreland Hotel, Chicago.

On September 17, 1962, Mr. FRENCH Was advised. that / “
investigation at Chicago had disclosed that om June 14 and'16, 1959,
telephone calls were reportedly made from the Shoreland Hotel. by
GROSBERG to the following numbers i2 the Detroit area:

WO 5-4900
WO 5-8329
LI 77-7237

Mr. FRENCH advised that he had received information
that. LI 7-7237 was GROSBERG’s home telephone number in 1959,
that WO 5-4900 was his. office telephone number im Detroit,.and
that. WO 5~8329 was the telephone number of his broker, Manley
Bennett and Company, Detroit. - ;

On September 20, 1962, Me. FRENCH requested that
contact. be made with Department Attorney JAMES.CANAVAN or
FRANK KIERNAN in care of the United States Attorney's Office in
Chicago in regard to obtaining access to a voluminous: tabulation
of toll calls of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
‘Washington, D;C. According to Mr. FRENCH, this tabulation was |

din the possession of the Department of Justice staff members in

 

Chicago:%hé, requested that it. be reviewed regarding toll calls
to or from individuals and telephone numbers known to be of
possible interest in this investigation, >for, the period April

1, 1959, to July 31, 1961. fil Mich-

On October 3, 1962, Mr. FRENCH advised that the Depart-
ment of Justice had received information that’ in July, 1959,
a trip was made to Chicago by HERBERT. L OSBERG of Detroit
which may relate to a telephods*eali-rs iy made to Public
pank by GROSBERG from Chicago in behalf of ALVIN NAIMAN. or ma
@ about the time NAIMAN’s request for a loan was considered by
the Teamsters Pension Fund in Chicago.

GROSBERG reportedly stayed at the Palmer House, Chicago, on
the night of July 20, 1959, and was’ charged ninety-nine cents
for a long-distance telephone call,

On October 3, 1962, Mir. FRENCH requested that contact
be made with CHARLES Z. SMITH, Special Attorney, Department
of Justice, Chicago, to arrange for a review of minutes of the
Teamsters Céntral States. Southeast-Southwest Areas Pension
Fund for any references to am application for a lean in 1959 in

name of ALVIN A, NAIMAN, Alvin Naiman. Corporation, Niagara
Crushed Stone — (Humberstone) , Ltd.» Akros Dynamics Corporation
or DOMINICK E, BARTONE. He advised that possibly this loan
application was considered on the same date as the loan for
the Ogelthorpe Hotel, Savannah,. Georgia.

    
   
  
   
 

a He also requested that
Z. SMITH has records in his. poss
calls made by attormey STANFOR fON concerning votes on
loans being considered by the Pension Fund and also whether
he has records of the Real Estate Research Corporation of Chicago
in his possession. Mr. FRENCH ‘requested if such records were
in the possession of Mr. SMITH that they be reviewed for any

applic ation.
