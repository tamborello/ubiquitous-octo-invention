also told her story to an American official, at the Em-
bassy, who claimed to represent the Warren Commission.

Elena was questioned regarding the identity of
ether persons attending the party at the Ruben Duran home
who might have been in a position to observe the three
Americans. Elena stated that in the course of the party

not take the calls and as a result “Alejandro” wrote

several letters to the daughter. ns Garro exhibited
two of the letters, as well as a business card which i-
dentified the young man as Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius.
(Ibid. p. 3)

The letter which Ms. Garro said was the first writ-
ten by the young man to her daughter bore the date Septem-
ber 1, 1963 and the Mexico City Post Office postmark Septem-

ber 2, 1963. When Ms. Garro was told this she commented

that the Communists probably had facilities for falsifying

postcards. (Ibid.) 4 rie Trersbyin0 thew

To investigate Ms. Garro's story further, the
Federal Bureau interviewed Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius
on November 27, 1964. (Ibid. p.4) Lavagnini recalled that
there were approximately thirty people at the Ruban Duran

party, few of whom he knew. He recalled having met a Mexi-

Americans.

Attached to the memo was a note from Flannery to
the Chief of Station, Winston Scott, which read, "Do you
want me to send the gist of this to Headquarters?" Scott
then noted that the memo should be filed. The file indi-
cations show that the memo went into the Oswald "P" file

and the Elena Garro "P" file. (Ibid.)

Mexico's finest poets and leading intellectuals. When
Octavio was named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple
separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also named
Elena, has always resided with her mother. « €

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early life
in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity about
her native land and had a reputation for being one of its

ole

more articulate detractors’ ™” At the same time, Elena was
considered emotionally committed to ayy aspects of Mexican —
life and made an important contribution to its artistic

development. At “?

Beers , .
7M the 1960's Elena became aSigniticand writer.

Hogar Solido, E1 Rey Mago, La Sefora en su Balcon, Ventura
Allende, Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje
are plays that have had appreciatve audiences in Europe,
where they were translated into German, as well'as in Mexi-
co. Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume
called La Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of
the London Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de
Porvenir,~-"a spendid success." Critics have said of her:
"For Elena Garro, there is no¥ frontier between reality

and fantasy; in any case, the latter is a second reality--

perhaps more intense--to which one may penetrate without

HW 50955 Bocld:322363506 Bage 5
passport or forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of
a literature fired with passion, flavor and life." Many
people who knew Elena have asserted that the frontier’
between reality and fantasy is also difficult for her to
distinguish in real life. (Biography Data Form on Elena
Garra de Paz prepared by Charles Thomas.)

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in
the Confederacion Nacional Campesina (CNC), the agrarian

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI). Because Ms. Garro

 

was a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of the
poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal terms

with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders from all

over the country. (Ibid.)

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated
woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright
opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers
in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political
connections rendered her Gait} immune from Serious cqunter-
attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the
country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba
Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations has been unable

to determine the exact reason Ms. Garro had for fleeing

Mexico.
