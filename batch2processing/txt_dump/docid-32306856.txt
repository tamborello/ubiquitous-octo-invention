PH 92-1027

On 1/23/69 PH 672-C-TE advised as follows:

JOSEPH SCAFIDI was driven from Bridgeton, N.J., to .
Philadelphia, Pa., by LCN Member VINCENZO TURCO, Informant -
informed ANGELO BRUNO of SCAFIDI's presence, resulting in
meeting between BRUNO, IGNAZIO DENARO, Underboss, Philadelphia
Family LCN, JOSEPH SCAFIDI, TURCO and PH 672-C-TE. BRUNO
told SCAFIDI that the delay of induction of new members has
been caused by refusal of JOSEPH RUGNETTA Consulieri, Philadelphia,
JOSEPH SCIGLITANO, Capodecina, Chester, Pa., and NICHOLAS PICCOLO,
Capodecina, Philadelphia, to attend an induction ceremony "In
New Jersey" and expressed their desire to hold induction:
ceremony in Philadelphia.

SCAFIDI complained that this was not good as the FBI
' followed ANGELO BRUNO around. BRUNO said there was some "S;0;
talking to the FBI and they knew "Every move I make." BRUNO
‘sbelieved Vineland, N.J., site, La Rosa Restaurant would have
Been “good", and mentioned that there was to be inducted, ome ©
from Trenton, N.J., being brought by Capodecina JOHN SIMONE;
one from Vineland, undoubtedly JOSEPH PERELLA, Owner, La Rosa .
Restaurant, and one from Philadelphia. Source believes candidate |
from Philadelphia will be either Philadelphia subjects, FRANK
SINDONE or FRANK IANNARELLA, also known as "Snuffy", both of whom
work With PHILIP TESTA in TESTA's loansharking and oe
- illegal numbers activities,

 

f

     

BRUNO said’ he will "See who he has to see" and will
keep SCAFIDI advised. Informant believes BRUNO will contact
member of Commission, LCN,

eh le

oe

DENARO said that the reason RUGNETTA, SCIGLITANO and.
PICCOLO do not want to go to New Jersey was because they, all :
of whom are members of the Calabrian Group, Philadelphia
Family LCN, have no candidate for induction.

 

Informant believes possibilities of induction night
of 1/26/69 are remote but states it is possible depending on
now quickly ANGELO BRUNO contacts the unknown person he made
reference to above.
