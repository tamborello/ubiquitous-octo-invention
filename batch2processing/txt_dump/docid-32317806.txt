WILLIE WEISBERG, posit. voice ident., entered the office
and went into the back room with ANGELO BRUNO. Hurriedlg
said something about the Commissioner (of Police?).

WW: They asked what I know about ANGELO BRUNO. How do you
know?. . Look, the Internal Revenue knows, EDGAR HOOVER
knows, TREASURY. knows. I said, look, whatever he's
doing is his own business.. Don't say, you know. Look,
you lecked me up. You followed me with the walkie~- :
talkies. I did. I said, my lawyer knows all about it. |
I run one guy around. I said, sergeant, you are a good |
sergeant. .He got in my room after me. You fellows fell,
into a trap. My attorney, I won't mention his name,
told me to use this telephone and make a date with
somebody out of town, and told me where to make it, and ©
sure enqugh you listened and you caught me and trapped
me. You followed me. I wasn't undressed. This girl
wasn't undressed. Whatever this guy said I don't know

; It's alie. I'll get the night man. I gave ten dollars

a to him in tips and I charged it to STANDARD-TOC. So

whatever is on their mind, I don't know. You have a job

to do, but don't bring me up like this... You talk
about this’MR. LEVY. I did know that he was in business
down South, but about this I don't know. Do you ever
see him? Yeah, I see him... But as far as him being

in with me... You're trying to link all of this business
with me to ANGELO BRUNO, You're talking up the wrong
tree. I'm not going to tell you about your city. You
got no organized crime here. If I have to answer, there’!
is no organized crime here. HARRY ‘STROMBERG is _in
jail. So they are picking on me. I'm the only Jew.
Who else are they going to pick on. That's how I said
it. He said, well, I wouldn't be that abrupt. But I
said, I am that abrupt. To me it don't make no
difference. I'ma Jew, pal, that's the only thing. .
I'm the only Jew, so you are picking on me, What you
want from ANGELO BRUNO, I don't know. But I read in
the papers, you could vomit. It's obnoxious. He took
eee I never heard of those things. He can answer for
himself. And I'11 tell you, we're good friends. He
deals in cigarettes. And he knows they do. It's i
legitimate, isn't it? What do you think he says? Not
for you and him. Me and you. I said, me and Him? I
