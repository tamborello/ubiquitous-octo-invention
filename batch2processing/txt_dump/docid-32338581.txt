he referred to "loans" of $32,000, it is noted that
donations in the amount of $63,678.95 are reported
as income. for the period ending 6/30/62.

CSNY 692-S stated on 3/10/62 that receipts
for donations from unidentified individuals - only
initials shown-are entered on the books as income. He
advised that loans as such are liabilities but that such
loans could be entered as income if there was no
expectation of repayment. & w}

In view of the above, the possibility exists
that Solo funds are also entered on the books of the
corporation as loans and/or donations, although on the
basis of the fund drive receipts as quoted above it would
seem the current procedure is to attribute the receipt
of Solo funds to the fund drive. ( Ye]

extent to which the following information is known, the follow-
ing is set forth administratively. ‘

Concerning ART SHIELDS' assignment to the Soviet
Union as Moscow Gorrespondent for TW, CG 58e4-S* advised

Prior to his leaving for Moscow,
sent instructions by GUS HALL concerning his conduct in Moscow.
SHIELDS was told that. he must not volunteer any information

NY 694-S* advised on 5/21/62 that GUS HALL
stated that day that according to JACK STACHEL TW
is in such bad shape financially that $6,000, per week

$140,000. will be needed to carry the paper through 1962. (KY)

NY 694-S* advised on 3/27/62, that according
to GUS HALL, the.financial condition of TW is so eritical
that it will have to have funds immediately. HALL
commented that ordinarily TW did not require extra financial
assistance until July or August, but that during the
present year the situation is so bad that the midweek
edition of the paper might very possibly have to be

abandoned. u)
