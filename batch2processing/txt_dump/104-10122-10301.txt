MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBIECT : Robert A. Maheu and Associates

1, This memorandum is for your information and contains
a recommendation for your approval in paragraph 5.

2. Various components of ‘the Agency have utilised Robert
A. .Maheu and his private enterprises since 1954. You were briefed
in 1966 on the various Agency projects with which Maheu was
associated in connection with his proposed appearance before
Senator Long's committee which was investigating wiretapping at
that time. You will recall that the Agency intervened with Senator
Long and arranged that Maheu would not be called to testify. In
Jaly 1966, you directed that one cover arrangement, then in effect
in Maheu's Washington office, was to be phased out and that Maheu
was not to be used by the Agency in any capacity at any time in the
future. As a result, "flags" were placed in Security files to the
effect that any inquiries concerning Maheu or his firm were to be
referred to the Deputy Director of Security.

3. The Central Cover Staff of the Clandestine Services -
requested and obtained, security clearances to use Maheu and
Associates to from 1 August
1968 through December 1970. The agent has now returned to
Washington and bas resigned from Maheu and Associates as it was
considered unwise to continue further cover arrangements because
of the adverge publicity Maheu had received in Las Vegas asa
result of his court battles with executives of the Hughes Tool Company.
Despite repeated reminders, Maheu and Associates have not billed
