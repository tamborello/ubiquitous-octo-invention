1, I had introduced AMPUNNY.1 and AMWHIP-1 to each other
24 May but the office was crowded, so there was very little
opportunity to discuss operational matters. We met again
on the above date, after business hours, and we were able
to meet in private. Although AMWHIP told me that he was
delighted with AMBUNNY-1 herself, as he said the ‘Cubans
like that kind of girl ~~ not too fancy", he thought that
ly her previously working for the
would aske the operation very
Fisky. He said that (Hit were discovered that AMPUNNY~1 was
@ penetration of the NAFU19 office {by the Cubars} his
connection with ODYOKE would the @ revealed, with the result
that all his “connectiona" withCUNBNAFU-19, and “Habana" would
be lost. AMWHIP-1 opined that he thought 1t likely that ‘the
Cubans would check ber out in divia> ;

 

2. AMWHIP suggested the? ssibllity of using a cutout
to introduce AMBUNNY-1 to the (UNBNAFU-19 tastallation. He
said he would explain in detail at a later time, what he
meant, obviously not wanting to reveal any more than necessary

to AMBUKNY-1.

3. Also, AMWHIP.2 stated that he was unable to travel
to Paris before ald.June, as he had soe relatives coming

I subsequentiy informed AMWHIP.1 and AMBUNNY-1 that the

AMDUNNY~1 that she could most likely uttll be utilized in
ba, and that we would discuss the possibilities at a -
