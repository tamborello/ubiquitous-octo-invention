1962, is ¥epetitious, Furthermore, it is believed that
the individual exiled groups in Miami definitely
exaggerate the strength and scope of the activities of
their counterparts in Cuba. Objective comments from
people not directly affiliated with any particular group
but active in underground operations substantiates this
view.

In addition, recent information indicates that
CIA has infiltrated a number of people into Cuba and that
these individuals are possibly more active than the
unsupported counter-revolutionary groups. C3=t)C u\
