9. The staffers remain particularly interested in determining
the name of the individual who Mr. Christensen believes relates to
the assassination. They will explore means of determining this
information to include the possibility of having Sgt. Stevenson
call Christensen and ask him for the identity (Stevenson indicated
his extreme unwillingness to do this. LTC Graham stated that this
request would have to be examined at policy level within DoD).

10. If the Committee is able to determine a specific name, |
the staffers indicated that they would probably initiate a specific
inquiry to NSA to again search our materials.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD : 21 November 1978

SUBJECT: House Assassination Committee Inquiry !

1. On 17 November 1978, Mike Smith, GC, and I attended an
interview conducted by staff members of the House Select Committee
on Assassinations in regard to the allegations of Mr, David F.
Christensen concerning the involvement of certain individuals in
the assassination of President Kennedy.

2. The interview was conducted by Messrs Kenneth Klein and
Gary Cornwell and was held in secure spaces provided by Mr. George
Murphy, Director of the Senate National Security Office. Both
individuals are authorized SI access.

3. The interview was conducted under terms of a Memorandum
of Understanding executed between the Committee and OSD on 15 November,
1978 (copy attached).

4, For purposes of the interview, DoD made available Sgt.
Nicholas B. Stevenson, USAF, who had been stationed with Mr.
Christensen at USA-55, Kirknewton, Scotland, in 1963. Sgt. Stevenson
was accompanied by ‘LTC Jéffrey Graham, USAF, Air Force Legislative
Liaison. 4USC2107(5)(g)(2(D)

(iii)

5. The Committee staffers were interested primarily in- Sgt.
Stevenson's recollections in regard to events described - by ME ¢
Christensen in a letter to Stevenson written in May- 1978.

6. Sgt. ‘Stevenson briefl described. ttie USA-55 site LC
mission and confirmed that ofly described. tié USA” mentioned in
Mr. Christensen's letter could have been intercepted by the site
but, to his knowledge, had not been an assigned target. Regarding
the specific allegations made by Mr. Christénsen that he had per-
sonally intercepted communications relating to the President's
assassination, Sgt. Stevenson emphatically stated that he had no
knowledge of such an event, though.in.all likelihood, if it had
occurred, it would have been widely known within the station and
the probable subject of:a CRITIC. .

7. Mike's and my role in the interview was concentrated largely .
on interpreting SIGINT jargon and emphasing the fact that the sites'
mission was and remains properly classified CONFIDENTIAL-HANDLE VIA
COMINT CHANNELS.

8. The staffers made no notes and agreed to let us review their
report, for. purposes of classification, on or after 20 November 1978.
