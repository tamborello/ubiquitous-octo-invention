IN TRE VOLUME OF WEAPONS ENTERING ABACO AND in ADDITION MORE AND.
MORE guns ARE FINDING THEIR WAY TO oPPosIT 10H ELEMENTS ow THE

SENTIMENT HAS BEEN PROMOTED BY THE BELIEF ON ABACO THAT ‘MUCH.

PRIVATE U.S. CAPITAL WILL SUPPORT A NEW, SMALL INDEPENDENT COUNTRY

AND IN ADDITION SOME ERSTWHILE NASSAU CAPITAL. WILL ALSO MOVE TO

ABACO, SOME ABACO RESIDENTS CLAIM THEY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

THAT BAY STREET MONIES WHICH ARE CONCEALED OR HAVE LEFT THE

MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED FROM THE PREMISES OF SEABREEZES, LIMITED, |
A CONSTRUCTION FIRM. ‘SENTIMENT EXPLAINING THIS DISAPPEARANCE

TAKES THREE FORMS, REGARDED AS LEAST LIKELY IS THAT OF A SIMPLE

THEFT UNRELATED TO POLITICAL ELEMENTS, A SECOND SCHOOL
BELIEVES THAT THIS MATERIAL, THE EQUIVALENT OF FOUR PICK- uP
TRUCK LOADS, HAS BEEN CACHED BY DISSIDENTS FOR FUTURE USE. A
POPULAR INTERPRETATION, HOWEVER, HAS IT THAT THE POLICE REMOVED
“THE DYNAMITE POSSIBLY TO MINIMIZE THE LIXELIHOOD OF VIOLENCE BY —
REMOVING EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL. ABACO DISSIDENTS, HOWEVER, CLAIM!
TO BELIEVE THAT THE POLICE REMOVED THE: DYNAMITE AS PART OF A
PROVOCATION WITH THE IDEA OF HOLDING THIS MATTER OVER THE HEADS

OF THE WHITE ABACO RESIDENTS FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE USE. THESE
PEOPLE CLAIM THAT THE DYNAMITE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN REMOVED WITH-
OUT POLICE COMPLICITY, SINCE THE AREA WAS WELL PATROLLED. ° IN
ADDITION THE POLICE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE LEASED A PICK-UP TRUCK
AROUND THAT TIME. Dee oS

5. A FURTHER UNSETTLING NOTE IS THE FACT THAT CHUCK HALL
WHO HAS BEEN FOMENTING VIOLENCE FOR SOME TINE AND WHO CLAIMS
RELATIONSHIPS WITH U.S. INTELLIGENCE HAS QUIETLY INQUIRED ABOUT
RENTING A RESIDENCE ON ABACO. END OF REPORT. °
