WASHINGTON — A federal judge
yesterday told the FBI to file with the
National Archives all of its tapes and
documents growing out of buggings and
wiretaps of slain civil rights leader Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.

The materiais cannot be made pub-
lic for at least 50 years, except by court
order. according to the ruling.

U.S, District Judge John Lewis
Smith J>. issued the order on dismissing
two civil suits filed against the FBI by
Bernard ,Lee. a former assistant to Dr.
King, and the Southern Christian Lead-
ership Conference, which Dr. King head-

ed until his assassination in April 1968.

ordered to seal
King tiles in archives ,

oo
The suits asked money damages
from the FBI for the buggings. They
alleged the FBI secretly recorded King’s
conversations in a motel room here in
1963 and sent a copy of the tape to his
wife, Corretta Scott King. as well as
bugging other conversations. .

In addition, the suits claimed copies
of those recordings and others were
played for members of the news media
as part of an attempt to discredit King.

Judge Smith dismissed the suits,
however, because they were not filed
before the three-year statui2 of limita-
tions for such action had run cut.

The FBI must provide the judge an
inventory of the materials within 99 days
and provide the material to the National
Archives in that same time period.
