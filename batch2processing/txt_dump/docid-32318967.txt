Dear Congressman McEwen: : 4s

This is in further response to your July 9th inquiry on
behalf of Ms.,,CarolynjSollar., Ms. Sollar yequests that the files
on the assassination of President John F.V¥Kennedy be released. ~

As you are aware, legislation was recently introduced
in both the Senate and the House regarding the release of all
Government files pertaining to the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy. In an effort to be of possible assistance in
responding to your constituent's concern, I am enclosing a copy
of the Director's remarks before the Committee on Governmental
Affairs on May 12th regarding the Assassination Materials
Disclosure Act, Senate Joint Resolution 282. You will note in
reading that Director Sessions supports the maximum disclosure
under the law of information pertaining to President Kennedy's
assagsination. You will also note his assurance that the FBI
will work cooperatively through the Department of Justice with
both the Senate and the House to develop a comprehensive approach
to these important issues.

I hope this information will assist you in responding
to Ms. Sollar.

Sincerely yours,

wee S 7
