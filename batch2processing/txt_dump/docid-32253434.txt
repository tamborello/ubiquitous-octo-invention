RE: JUNE 2, 1977, REQUEST OF HSCA FOR FBI

This will respond to the June 2, 1977, letter to the
Director of the FBI from Congressman Louis Stokes, Chairman,
HSCA, requesting FBI Identification Records of the four above-
referenced names.

Subsequent to delivery of the June 2nd letter, an
HSCA representative furnished the dates and places of birth
(DPOB) and name variations as follows:

(1) Loran Eugene Hall.- DPOB: January 4, 1930,
Newton, Kansas.

(2) Lawrence Howard - DPOB: January 17, 1935,

(3) William Seymour - DPOB: January 12, 1937,
Fort’ Benton, Montana.

(4) Jerry Patrick Hemmings - first name may be
Jerald, Gerald or Gerould.

Searches to locate pertinent Identification Records
were based on the limited information furnished by HSCA and
since fingerprints did not accompany the request, the FBI can-
not guarantee that the following material concerns the
individuals that HSCA is interested in. Identification Records
were located and copies are attached as enclosures one through
four as follows:
