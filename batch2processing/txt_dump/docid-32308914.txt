MI 92-262

and local authorities have been exerting tremendous pressure
onmany of the operations connected with the Rockford family
to the point where they are not able to make any move without
being under the scrutiny of the authorities, In view of
‘this added pressure, BUSCEMI said he wants no incidents

to take place and was extremely upset at the possibility
that there was some possible "muscle action" being exerted
by JOE ROBERTS.in connection with NICK GENTILE. BUSCEMI

said he wanted this matter to be straightened out completely,
and that later on that same day he was arranging with informant
to meet personally with ROBERTS so that this problem could
be solved,

. Before leaving, BUSCEMI told him that if JOE
MARINELLI should come to Milwaukee, the informant was to give
him nothing, show him no respect, and make no effort. to

have any contact with him, BUSCEMI gave no reason for his
instructions regarding MARINELLI, but the informant was of
the opinion that any individual who is treated in this manner
is in bad straits with the LCN family, and in many instances,
many individuals who received this type of treatment are
possibly set up for a "hit." The informant commented the !
possibility existed that MARINELLI may have been suspected :
of talking to the Grand Jury about LCN matters, :

 

Later that same day, the informant was contacted
in Rockford ty KNOBBY GULOTTA, Rockford LCN family, and
JOE ROBERTS. It was. evident to the informant that ROBERTS
and GULOTTA were working to gether in a house siding oe
operation, The informant made it Glear' to GULOTTA and
ROBERTS that there was to be no muscle action upon instructions
of FRANK BUSCEMI. ROBERTS’ and GULOTTA both agreed that they .
would have nothing further to do with ‘NICK GENTILE, and that
they would not’ create any incidents, |.

The informant said he recéived the impression
through the above meeting thait everyone in the Rockford
LCN family is upset at the recent action of the Federal Grand
Jury in that the pressure exerted by the Federal and
local authorities has brought their gambling and other illegal
activities to a standstill in Rockford.

AS THIS MOST VALUABLE INFORMANT WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED
