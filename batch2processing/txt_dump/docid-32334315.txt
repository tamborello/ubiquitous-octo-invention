purpose of this unit appears to be the conducting of
harassment tactics and the aggravating of lecai Bogalusa
citizens such as BASCOM TALLEY, the former President of
the Louisiana Bar Association and owner cf the local
newspaper, LOU MAJORS, the editor of the Bogalusa news-.
paper, and RALPH BLUMBERG, the owner of a local Bogalusa
radio station. NO 1271-8 reported the reason for these
acts of harassment is that all three iodividuals in the
past have been very open in their condemnation of the Klan
and similar type erganizations and that this harassment
eonsists of placing dead animals at the residences of these
individuals, Placing of roofing tacks in their driveways,
ete.

| The New Crleans Gffice is of the opinion that

this “Minutemen” unit in Bogalusa may not in any way be

: eonnected vith the national organization headed by ROBERT
DEPUGH of Norborne, Missouri, and that WARNER is merely
using the name “Minutemen.” In an effort to determine
whether this unit at Bogalusa is connected with the national
organization, NO 1271-R has advised that ae has asked WARNER
for "Minutemen" Litereture so that the members could read
about the organization, and WARNER has stated that he dees .
not have any literature es this is one way that the FBI ean
identify the members. Further attenpts are being made by

NO 1271-8 to determine if the unit at Bogalusa is in any
manner connected with the national organization, end the
Bureau will be kept advised.
