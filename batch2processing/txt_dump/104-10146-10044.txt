Chief Counsel § Director

Select Committee-on Assassinations

House of Representatives .
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Blakey:

Following our conversation on 17 December, about
CIA's reporting to the Warren Commission on Oswald's
movements at a certain location outside the United States,
it occurred to me that it might assist your researchers
if I were to specify the reporting in question. (U)

I have already. i role in obtaining the & .
information from a ——~
and assume this needs no further specification. Additionally,
it should be pointed out that on 31 January 1964 the Agency
submitted a fourteen page report to J. Lee Rankin of the
Warren Commission recording the basic information available
from Agency sources. Your investigators should be able to
identify this as being processed for FOIA as document
number 509-803, although it was not released under FOIA
because sensitive sources and methods were involved; it
continues to be classified Secret to this date. That
document has been reviewed at the Agency by your investi-
gators. (S)

 

 

That the information was provided the-Warren Commission
early in its inquiry, in the two forms noted above, is
clear, Why one of the investigators for the Commission
did not take it into consideration until some 3-4 months
later cannot be reconstructed at this late date. (U)

Very truly yours, oe
