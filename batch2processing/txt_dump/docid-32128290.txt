Mr. We Collek, Publisher .
“Verzag und Velt :
Berlin W 8 ~
“Glinkestrasse 13-15
Germany,

Dear Mr. Caollek,
Thank you for your acknowledgement of October 31, which arrived yesterday.

Should you become interested in WHITEWASH: THE REPORT ON THE WARREN, REPORT;

 

; it will/seve time for us both if you contact my British agent, Mr. Gordo ord,
3 53 St, Martin's Lane,,.WC_2,.ENGLAND, Phones, Temple Ber 8985/1320. My fidence

-in and my relationship with Harbord are such that I have empowered him to make any
- grrengement he wants for my book, without consultation with me. I tell you this
because this subject is opentng much more rapidly thet the press indtietes or
people generally understand. For example, the recent givernment actions supposedly
making more data. availble and the resturnpot the pictures and Xrays of the autopsy.
These are fradduzant actions intended to end actually accomplishing further suppress- i
ion. Mr. Harbord jpow had two additional ‘s tip#es on this; subjects and I project a% °
‘lesst a third as soon as my neweat book, ‘TEWASH II; WHO DID IT! Is published. I
antiel pete this. will be soon. ‘Dropoae, Look bi HN eee bel ue Shere

see rae

 
 
 

The sequel does not in any way duplicate YHITEWASH. The two, together, “are two
parts of my own report on the Warren Report. The second, coming largely from previous-
ly suppressed documents that have been kept out ofthe record and until now unpublish-
ed, is in some ways more shocking than the first book. Mr. Harbord has an almost
‘complete copy of this thet he can probably show you if you have a representative in
“Ehglend. This, book is perheps the strongest indictment, af self-indictment, of the
federal police, and intelligence egencies{ 1 have all of the documents end may, evens
‘tually, print @ supplement of ‘just these documents end pictures, in fescimile,. It

ig an overwhelming thing..

 

‘Phenk you for your interest.

Sincerely,

  
 

:

Herold Weisberg

~ Should you write Mr, Harbord, I would appreciate the courtesy of 8 cerbon copy, in
the interest of time. Should he then consult me, I would know in edvance sbout what.
