“For foregoing reasons, Reid indicated he is
adamantly opposed to having weapons sent to Cubs
directly from D.R. He also repeated an earlier,
statement that he was not permitting exiles to
move directly from D.R. against Cuba. Yet because
of sympathy for anti-Castro cause, and on humani-
tarian grounds as well, he would like to be helpful
in facilitating arms trangshipment via Venezuela.”

from Santo Dominge:

a
po fron Bane message hag been received|[

"I conveyed pointe enumerated in Section B of
Reftel to Reid and Caceres Jan 14. feild indicated
gome of wha’, I told his confirmed information already
communicated to him by Ray. Reid fully understood
thet if he went ahead with transaction, it would be
at hig own risk and U.8. position, if origin became
public, would havo be that thig normal export to

GODR.

“Reid did not repeat not ask us to deny export
license, evidently preferring to investigate mattor
further before making hig decision. His primary
concern ig whether onward shipment to Venezuela hes
approval Venezuelan Govt. He said in absence diplo~

“matic relations this difficult ascertain. He lacked

sufficient confidence in Yenezuelan Consul General
bere or in hig own in Yenezucla to use them as
channels. After i discouraged him from expecting

us to agcertain attitude Venezuelan Government for
him, be indicated he would probably ask hig Ambassador
io Washington to sound out his Vesezuelan colleague

there.

“Beid's concern about assuring onward shipment
atens largely from his great respect for lethal
qualities of weapong involved and fear they sight
find way into wrong hands here. He said he would
not slliow them to be uncrated here or broken down
into packs of sixty oach which he Indicated was fora
in which they would be shipped eveatually to Cubs.
