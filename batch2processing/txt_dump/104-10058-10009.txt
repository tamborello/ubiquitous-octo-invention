‘Department. a

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent
variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HEMMING.

7. From the name, physical description, activity, and
alleged employment, it is apparent that Gerald Patrick HEMMIN
is identical with the subject of Office of Security file
429 229, who has been described as. six-foot five, 250 pounds,
who is a notorious mercenary and soldier of fortune and who as
of. May 1975 was ostensibly employed by a private investigation
‘company, TEPCOL Security (Office of Security--no record) in

_ Miami, Florida.

8. Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,
the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JNNAVE. Gn
Bike 2 wD veces LOS ert ar Beast the eaily i368' Ds» HLopu- wenee)
iad claimed Agency affiliation when in fact there has heen :
none. .The most.recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such
affiliation was.in May 1975 when he volunteered his services
‘to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Gerald Patrick HANMING
isa long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#3535 459),
aka: “Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In
the late 1950's HENMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter —
claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thsreafter,
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and
Central American activities which he named the International 4
Anti-Conmunist- Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
(the backers.of whom have never been fully established) was
named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING. -

9. For an ‘appreciation of the possible ramifications of
a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot
involving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
‘memorandum, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;
and an extract from a. book published in early 1976 written by
‘Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN. The book Coup d'etat
in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy
is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency
‘with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the major ;
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,
.Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-
“‘nental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
-GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Force) was involved in the.assassination of President KENNEDY
sand that members of this unit were connected with CIA. GARRISON
‘shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and .
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.
