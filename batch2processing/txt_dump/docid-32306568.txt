Commercial Survey Company

Sergeant FRANK NASH, Intelligence Unit (IU), Chicago
Police Department (CG PD), advised on 2/8/61 that the IU had
recently set up a dummy juke box corporation in CG for the
purpose of investigating the Commercial Survey Company at 110
N. Franklin St., CG, and the Recorded Music Service Association,|/
188:-W. Randolph St., CG. Although these are separate firms, ,
they are, in actuality, one in the Same, and the purpose of Li
these companies is a shake-down of juke box operators in the.
CG area, which nets these companies in excess of $100,000 per,
year. Juke box operators are charged $1.15 a month per
machine by these companies on a "subscription" basis. If
any questions are given, the purpose of the company is to
“investigate stolen and broken juke boxes. |} |

stopped by the Oak Park PD. Mrs. SWEAZY admitted she was the
passenger in this automobile but denied that they were pro-
ceeding at a high rate of speed, She said that she had been
to the Armory Lounge and the Amber Light Lounge on that night

and said that to her knowledge there were no other hoodlums
in either place, (4) .

Mrs. SWEAZY stated that in her opinion SAM GIANCANA
is a "perfect gentleman" and is being unduly harrassed by the
various law enforcement agencies. She said that GIANCANA
has told her that he is a "retired gambler" and that she is
inclined to believe his statement. She said that she does
not believe GIANCANA is a mobster as disclosed by newspaper
articles and that if she did believe this she would no longer
associate with him. Mrs. SWEAZY added that GIANCANA at the

time was "out of town" but declined to state exactly where
he may be. (W

PCI advised SA HILL on 2/8/61 that

GIANCANA was on that date at the Armory Lounge in Forest Park,
Ill. .

and GUS. ALEX held a conference on that date during whic

to hold meetings at the Armory Lounge in view of the fact
the police have been known to conduct surveillances on a
regular basis re the syndicate. (4a
