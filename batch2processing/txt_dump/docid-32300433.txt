Memo from A. H. Belmont Mr ; Tolson ‘11- -64' pointed out...
that neutralization of persons who constitute ‘a danger to the |
President is a Secret Service function. However, thére may be some
few sensitive cases where action by the Secret Service would destroy

 

an FBI operation of value to this country. The question was raised
as to whether in these few instances the FBI would prefer-t6"handle
the subjects itself, rather than to have Secret Service neutralize
them during a Presidential visit. The Director noted, "I am opposed
to accepting this responsibility." . a

Memo Branigan to Sullivan ° a oe .
re: PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEE eS
ON THE WARREN REPORT

We cannot adequately protect our sources when these 16
names are out of our possession, and may even be furnished by
Secret Service to the local police for "neutralization."

Dangers in Handling by Secret Service and Local Police:
Consideration should be given to getting these 16 names

back from Secret Seryice. These cases are all pending active

investigations of intelligence (espionage) agents, Should a leak

occur in the Secret Service, the lives of.our defectors—in-place
would be in jeopardy.

For example, take the case of (Josef. Ulver, a Czech illegai Ch
agent,\ operating as a [traveling salesman of religious articles, | Hel
as identified to us our defector~in-place, [é1iii, who is now in
{Czech intelligence headquarters in Prague,) and who has [just recentl

CS furnished additional information, [through CIA regarding (Czech (a enty S$)
in the U.S, If(Ulve 'Sjname leak out, (GIMME would be under oF
immediate suspicion, * : . |

) Another example is[Alexis von Volborth, a Soviet KGB iv 2)
illegal| whose very existence is known to only a_limited number of
persons in the New York KGB Residency, includinggour defector-in-
Fee FEDORA, who reported him to us. If his name leaked, FEDORA -

 

would be in a precarious position. *€The head of the KGB in New York °
is already of the belief, from review of testimony in the tienen Cx)
Ivanov trial, that the FBI. has an informant within the KGB 'EDORA
furnished us with information on five other persons in this list of :
16, If their names were leaked, FEDORA could be easily identified |
by the KGB as our source, .

The same situation would prevail if the Secret Service
gave the names the local police and the names were leaked by the
police, The effect would be the same if the local police attempted
to restrain these persons and the latter reported this to their
intelligence principals. In the case of local police action-looking
toward "neutralization," we would not only have placed our
informants’ lives in jeopardy, but we would have surrendered control
of the investigation of these sensitive -espionage cases to the
local police, -

Re-evaluation of the 16 "Cases: On 10-29-64, the Director met with
‘the President's Committee on Presidential Protection, The Director
pointed out that we disseminate to the Secret Service on subversive
individuals, even where there is no indication the individual has
threatened the President; that these are the type of people we would

. pick up in the event of a war emergency.
