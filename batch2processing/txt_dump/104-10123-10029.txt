MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, LEOB/SRS
SUBJECT: NAGELL, Richard Case - #261170

REF: IN Cable 25955 dtd 6 June 1968 fr

 

OUT Cable 06625 dtd 7 June 1968 +

Reference cables concern the claim of an individual appearing at
the Consul General's office in Zurich, Switzerland on 4 June 1968 that
he is one Richard Case NAGELL. NAGELL was sentenced to a 10 year term for
bank robbery on. 9 dune 1964 and is supposedly in a federal prison in Missouri.

GARRISON interviewed Subject as a witness in his investigation
according to a news clipping from the CHICAGO AMERICAN dated 2 January
1968. The clipping is marked in Subject's file which is attached. This
file also contains a copy of the summary dated 18 January 1968 pre¢pared
in research on the GARRISON CASE.

It would be of interest for documentation of Subject's file to
ascertain from the FBI if Subject is still in préson.

I did not receive reference IN Cable 25955 initially. Attached is
a copy I obtained from 0S Cable Desk. However, the original copy was
routed to SRS and it is possible some one else on the Staff is already
handling the matter.

The attached report by Mrs. Halli

FRI. Is NAGELL in GARRISON investigation
