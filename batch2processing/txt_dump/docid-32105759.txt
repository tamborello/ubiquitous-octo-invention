Operation MONGOOSE, 14 September 1962

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy; the Attorney General; Mr. Johnson; Mr. Nitze,
7 . General Lemnitzer, General Lansdale; General Carter;
| . Mr. Donald Wilson

. 1. The Group approved in principle General Lansdale's paper
4 of 31 August, with the amendments that had been agreed upon at last
. week's meeting and which‘were attached to General Lansdale's memo-
i ’ randum of 12 September. However, Mr. Bundy made it clear that this
did not constitute blanket approval of every item in the paper and
that sensitive ones such as sabotage, for example, will have to be

i ; presented in more detail on a case by case basis. —

 

 

 

 

 

' o ; 2. | General Lansdale noted that he has asked appropriate people
in the Pentagon to draw up estimates covering requirements for person-
: nel, space, communications, etc., against the contingency that Cuban

i : operations will move into a more active phase and will require such
facilities.

} 3. General Carter said that CIA would examine the possibilities
H N of sabotaging airplane. parts which are scheduled to be shipped from
: Canada to Cuba, .

4. CIA will attempt to develop hard intelligence on the re-
' ported funding of subversive elements in Ecuador and perhaps elsewhere,
from Canada. Mr. Johnson emphasized that any such evidence which could
' : be adduced: before the OAS Foreign Ministers’ meeting would be highly
valuable.

5. General Lansdale reported that the NSA collection program
is being stepped up considerably and should be in full swing by
- 1 November,

6. Mr. Bundy expressed his concern about the necessity for
linking planning in the political and military fields with the MONGOOSE
operations. He said that his tentative conclusion is that what is
required is a tightly knit interagency group closely tied to the
MONGOOSE group but not a part of it. He said he would discuss this
concept with higher authority.

7. General Carter reported on CIA's contacts with Pan American
regarding its Havana flights, He said that the company had asked
the Agency to buy its blocked pesos at a one-for-one rate at a scale
. of $140,000 a month retroactive to last May lst. He said that in the
‘ face of this proposal, CIA had agreed to buy $200,000 worth, provided
: _ Pan American makes no move at this time to discontinue its service.
He, said there were assurances that no such» move would be made before
October Ist at the earliest.

After some discussion, the Group agreed that it is highly
desirable to maintain this service. On theother hand, it appears
that Pan American's estimates of the amount of money it is losing and
the amount of subsidy required to break even.are apparently excessive.
General Carter undertook to look into the possibility, suggested by
the Attorney General, that Pan American could lower its quoted fare,
inasmuch as the company is not getting the benefit of the $20 now in

any case,

It was generally agreed that government operation of this
service would be just as expensive as having Pan American continue it,

8. The Attorney General raised the question of actions by
Cuban exile students against the Castro regime. He recognized, as did
the rest of the Group, the fact that these activities can serve as a
“cover ‘far ‘fulure U.sS.+sponsored operations. “On ‘the ‘other hand, it was
-recognized equally that bad publicity could result. It was suggested
to that CIA might talk to selected students and spread the idea that any
i : active operations planned by them must in fact be reasonable and worth-
. while ones, and to leave the idea that irresponsible actions might

lead to trouble for them in the future.
