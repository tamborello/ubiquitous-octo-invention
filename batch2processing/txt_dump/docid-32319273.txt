DETAILS: By way of back§rdund, in October, 1993, the Information
Resources Division (IRD), which is tasked with meeting the FBI’s
obligations under the Act, identified the need to have one of the
LCD CDRU teams assist the JFK Task Force since FOIPA Analysts,
beyond those already on the Task Force, were unavailable due to
responding to a voluminous number of court-ordered deadlines over
the next two years. At the time, the Task Force was attempting
to begin and sustain the timely transfer to NARA of the one
million plus pages of FBI documents subject to transfer under the
Act. The CDRU team was needed not only to help fill the need for
additional skilled document processing reviewers but, more
importantly, to provide the benefit of its very extensive

DETAILS: By memorandum dated 10/25/93, copy attached, you
requested that a Supervisory PLS Specialist from the Civil
Discovery Review Unit, and that supervisor’s team be detailed to
the JFK Task Force for six months to assist in the review and
production of documents relating to the Kennedy assassination.
By addendum dated 11/1/93, LCD agreed to detail one team of PLSs
until 2/11/94.

On 1/28/94, we met to discuss the volume of work
remaining to be addressed by the JFK Task Force. You requested
that the temporary detail of CDRU personnel be extended through
June, 1994. Although I was unable to accommodate your request,
we have continued to discuss potential compromise positions with
your Deputy, Gary L. Stoops.

Recently, we agreed to the following compromise.
First, the entire team will be left in place through March, 1994,
to permit completion of the processing and production of the Lee
Harvey Oswald files. The team will be returned to CDRU on or
before 4/4/94. Second, we have agreed to extend the detail of
PLSs Kevin VanHutton until 7/5/94, to permit him to train a
supervisor from among the IRD personnel assigned to the project.
Third, we have agreed to extend the detail of PLS Gary E. Emrick
and to detail PLS Joyce Hollman Taylor, an experienced senior
document reviewer, to the JFK Task Force, to assist PLS
VanHutton. We have not yet agreed on a reporting date for PLS
Taylor, but we did agree that she will be returned to LCD on
7/5/94, with PLSs VanHutton and Gary Emrick.

I trust this accurately reflects our agreement and is
satisfactory to you.
