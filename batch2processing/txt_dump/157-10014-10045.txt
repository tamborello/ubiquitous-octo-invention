Mr. Gray. That was my understanding.

Mr. Schwarz. Did the 5412 Committee ever approve an

TESTIMONY OF GORDON GRAY

Mr, Gray. I have always considered it a privilege to appear

Prone [Ares 207) $44-6000

before a Senate Committee. As perhaps you know, I had a session

i
on July 5 with four members of the Committee staff, I should

Like to say, Mr. Chairman, that I found them courteous, intelligent,

 

able and well informed. I hope that our meeting was a construc~

Hes one.

i trust that I need not assure you that I wish to be as

 

helpful as I can, but I must remind you that we shall probably

se talking about situations which existed something like 15 to

‘1? years ago and I fear that my recollections are not as sharp
if
“as I would like them to be. The staff members did give me

some refreshment by showing me memoranda which I beliave will

"form the basis for your questions. 1 might say that these were
il

memoranda which I had not seen before, and I believe that the

leeason that they were not distributed to principals of what is

‘now called the Forty Committee was that President Eisenhower
-e wanted only one copy of notes of these meetings in existence
i
and that was to be kept in the files of the Director of the
“central Intelligence Agency. An exception was made in the case
