Re: 62-HQ-1029205-418, 06/10/1998

 

190-0-serials 1543 was identified. It had been
previously permanently charged out to “Record
Disposition and Archival Unit” (No copy maintained by
NK) in 1990.

80-648 is a control file for Liaison with

United States Secret Service (USSS.) There are three
volumes of same and a review determined that nothing
had been indexed regarding LEE HARVEY OSWALD. Two
index cards located in General Indices reflected a
stamp which referred to 80-648, a Secret Service
liaison file. These are printed cards of unknown
origin, and reflected the use of aka LEE HARVEY OSWALD
by EDWARD JOSEPH PATTERSON, DOB - 2/8/48, POB, Camden,
New Jersey, Social Security Number - 148-40-6255. No
file can be located in Newark re this. Records
Supervisor Phyllis Ricks advised she had no knowledge
of origin of and further advised there was no
additional indexing to 80-648. She surmised that they
had been sent to FBI, NK by USSS.

Regarding LEE HARVEY OSWALD and MARINA OSWALD -—
05. File 105-15291, Volumes I and II, constituting entire
yw & a file, were also sent to “RECORD DISPOSITION AND
ya® \yairk 4 ARCHIVAL UNIT,” no date reflected, no copy maintained

captioned matter.
