actual production. At this tine the walk-in jWuse of the operation
appears promising; hovever, his access to any hard intelligence is
new nil, and his production of operational suprort information has
dwindled to infrequent rarginal reports. Thus he is ef no further
operational use to JIJAVE unless ha is recentacted ‘and utilized by
ANQUAKE, and cur experience in this type operation has shown us that
utilization by ANQUAKE can be a long, drawn out affair before any
tangible results are achieved.

$. Therefore, JIMAVE is initiating actions to terminate as of
30 April 1967 (expiration date of current FAJAVE deposit to the caver
conpany) ANHARSH/1's salary and cover exployment. We have advised
ANHARSH/L of the probability that he will be terninated, and he is
now in the process of seeking other employment in the JMWAVE area
where he wishes -to remain. After 30 April 1967 our contact and
financial arra ents vith ANUARSH/2] will depend upon the status of
his contacts wi MSTAPP. A change of erployers by AMIARSH/2
should have no preat cffeet on ANSTAFE's interest in hin, ince
AUSTAFP is avare from ANTUIU/L's valkedn report that AMHAPRSH/1 was
dissatisfied with his cover conpany position.

2. In view of the above AMMUG/1 was queried about the procedures
followed by AMSTAFF with reference to walk-ins. AMMUG/1 advised that
instructions had been issued to all overseas representatives to treat
walk-ins courteously and to show interest in whatever they had to

- offer. All possible background and rersonal information was to be
acquired by the overseas representative and this information was to be
forwarded to AMQUAKE Headquarters for confirmation and analysis. All
walk-ins were considered potential sources of information and all were
considered to have possible future utilization. AMMUG/1 claimed that
information forwarded to ANSTAFF Neadquarters was screened and sent
to the desk officer for the specific area where the walk-in would
probably work if recontacted. It was the responsibility of the desk
