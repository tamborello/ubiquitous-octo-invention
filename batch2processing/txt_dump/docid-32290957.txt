15. Remarks:

Bureau authority for the installation at TRAFFICANTE's
residence was obtained telephonically on August 9, 1962,
from the Bureau. The installation was made on the same
date and placed in operation at 4:50 p.m., August 9, 1962.
The installation consists of a MATE which is installed

in the master bedroom of the TRAFFICANTE residence. It
is noted that TRAFFICANTE formerly had a telephone in
this bedroomwhichhas since been disconnected. TRAFFICANTE
and his wife apparently spend a great deal of time in the
bedroom, as they have a television set in this room. It
should be noted that installation of a MATE in another
portion of the subject's residence was precluded at the
time of installation for reasons of security.

16. Recommendation of Assistant Director:
