State Department advises that Commission request to deciassify
Legal Attache Mexico City's 5-18 "Secret" summary memorandum is not
likely to cause harmful repercussions between Mexico and U. S. and
it has no objection to declassification, This recommends that we
prepare a sanitized unclassified version of the summary for delivery
to the Commission, a procedure which the Commission now states will
meet its needs. ,

The Commission on 9-22 asked us to declassify the "Secret"
18l-page 5-18-64 summary prepared by Legal Attache Mexico City.
The principal reason for classification of the summary was: to avoid
Gisclosure of active investigation in Mexico by Bureau personnel, a
factor the Mexicans strongly opposed and te protect highly sensitive
security informants (Mex 18 and 19) who provided some of the data
in the document. Because of possible international repercussions
between Mexico and U. 8. if the summary was made public, we on 9-23
sought the views of the State Department. State's 9-29 written reply
expresses view that declassification is not likely to cause harmful
repercussions between Mexico and U. §. and, accordingly, it interposes
no objection to declassification.

Legal Attache, Mexico City, is opposed to declassification
of the document in its present form and suggests that, if possible,
a sanitized version be prepared by deleting three nonsubstantive items
which are not referred to in the Commission's report and by deleting
references to sources of information through which reader may distinguish
between Mexican sources and Bureau Agents.

ra On 10-1 Miss Hennigan, secretary to W. David Slawson,
staff member of the Commission, advised that 58 ublic disclosure
of the summary in its present form is in any/ ectionable to the
Bureau, a redraft.of same deleting or changing the material which may
be harmful to Bureau's operations would fully 2it the Commission's
needs providing the rewrite covers all of the Mexican aspects of this
investigation touched upon by the Commission report.
