SF 2550-C-TE advised on October 25, 1963, that i
at about 10:45 A.M., October 22, 1963, he was in the office
of ANGELO MARINO at the California Cheese Company in San ro
Jose, California. Present at this time were ANGELO, :
SALVATORE and JOE MARINO. ANGELO said he was very happy
to see Informant because he was just going to send his oe
brother JOE MARINO to Martinez to give them a very impor- :
tant message. He stated he had received a tip, the source
of which he did not identify, that the "Feds" were going to
search the houses of members of the organization. He
recommended that Informant remove any guns he might have
from his house and any other contraband articles that he
might have stored. He suggested Informant immediately
return to Martinez and give this information to ALEX
CAMARATA. ANGELO MARINO also stated that they all had -
to be very careful as they were all being followed. ‘

From Informant's conversation with the MARINOs,
he gathered that they were "all shook: up" because of the
publicity and inquiries being made by the F.B.I. and other
Federal agencies regarding La Cosa Nostra.

Informant thereafter traveled to Martinez, i)
California, where he attempted to contact ALEX CAMARATA,

CAMARATA was not at home at the time so Informant contacted

MRS. ALEX CAMARATA at her cleaning and tailor shop. When

he related that the "Feds" were going to search their homes

she went into a panic and stated in Sicilian that they had aan

to hurry and "get it out of my house." She had Informant

drive her to her house, whereupon they found that ALEX had
just arrived, in company with one of his workers, an uniden-
tified colored man. ALEX and this. colored man were in the a
house at the time and it appeared that ALEX had just paid i.
the colored man.' MRS. CAMARATA immediately shouted to

ALEX inSicilian that they were going to have their houses .
searched and that he should get the "stuff" out of the t.
house, ALEX ran to a back room of the house and brought

out some items which he stuffed into a lunch pail. Infor-

mant identified certain of these items as being at least

two .38 caliber revolvers and an ammunition-type belt.

These ALEX put into a lunch pail and ran out of the house.

Informant offered to take these items and throw them off

the bridge, thinking that he could bring them to the San

Francisco Office for examination, However, ALEX declined,

stating that he was going to take them to his. uncle's place,

JOSEPH VENTIMIGLIA, who is‘an old Italian residing in

Martinez, California.

‘Informant has been unable to learn the entire
contents of this lunch pail or the ammunition-type belt
but indicated that it might contain ammunition or money.

ALEX CAMARATA, who is the son-in-law of JOHN

MISURACA of New Jersey, previously advised Informant on or
about October 18, 1963, that he, CAMARATA, had been in
contact with the MARINOs of San Jose, California, who told
him that at some future date they might be called upon to

'. hide out members of the organization who were being sought
by the law. The MARINOs indicated that ALEX and Informant
would be kept advised if their services were needed at any
time in this regard.
