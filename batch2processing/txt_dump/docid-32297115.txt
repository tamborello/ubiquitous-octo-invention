Previous investigation has reflected that the
MIRR is an anti-CASTRO revolutionary organization of Cuban
exiles under the leadership of Dr. ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA.

Prior to November, 1964, this organization was
involved in several raids and attempted raids against
targets in Cuba, however, on November 19, 1964, the MIRR
announced an alleged raid on the night of November 18,
1964, which was never confirmed by the CASTRO government,
and no confirmation was ever obtained this raid took place.

Again, on January 17, 1965, another alleged raid,
against the Niagara Sugar Mill in Pinar del Rio Province,
was announced by the MIRR on January 18, 1965. Again, no
confirmation was ever received of this raid, however, the
CASTRO government, after a delay of several days, made an
announcement which purported to confirm the raid, although
the Cuban announcement contained facts which were inconsis-
tent with the MIRR announcement.
