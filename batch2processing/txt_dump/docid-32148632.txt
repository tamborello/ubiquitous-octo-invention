The summary can ¢éadily be ended to su the Commission's
geeds and at the same me to protec ex an and to avoid y 4)
disclosure of the extent of our investigation in Mexico, This can

be accomplished by deleting reference to three.items which are not
touched upon in the Commission's report and by rewriting an introduction
paragraph on page one deleting a specific reference to a confidential
source abroad (Legat). The Commission's report on page 304 records
that". . . the Government of Mexico initiated a thorough investigation
to uncover as much information as possible on Oswald's trip.
Representatives of U. 8S. agencies worked in close liaison with

Mexican law enforcement authorities." A slight revision of
introductory paragraph on p one. will accurately fit the above
statement of the Commissionts ‘) ; .

RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that to properly protect our operations
in Mexico, the 5-18 summary be written in unclassified form as
aforesaid. To do this will not require complete retyping. We
propose to amend principally by deleting five to six pages and to
reproduce the document by Xerox and to renumber the pages Ayu)
