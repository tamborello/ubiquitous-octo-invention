the Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (OKKKK) as well as
the Minutemen in Bogalusa.

. WARNER stated that "JELLY" POUNDS is self-employed
asa painter and his real name is RANDLE C. POUNDS, telephone
RE 2~4975. . .

WARNER also remarked that after the Minutemen meeting
on January 26, 1965, the members would go to the area of the
residence of LOU MAJORS and ostensibly have a flat tire and
then proceed to make a loud noise changing this tire in order
to aggravate MAJORS. WARNER stated that an individual by
the’ name of ROBERT RICHMOND, an attorney, resides next door
to MAJORS and RICHMOND had been forewarned of this so that he
and his family would not be concerned. :

WARNER also related that he had been advised by
an unknown waitress at Graham's Cafe that the owner of the
cafe had been informed by Mayor JESSE CUTRER and ANDY OVERTON,
the Commissioner of Finance, that during this week Negroes
would be testing his establishment to see whether they would
be served. WARNER stated that CUTRER and also ARNOLD SPIERS,

WARNER was overheard to tell COONE that he
wanted COONE to obtain a can of spray paint and a can of
spray glue which could be placed in the lock and door
to the office of LOU MAJORS, BASCOM TALLEY and RALPH
BLUMBERG, in order to make these doors and locks inoperable.

COONE was overheard to ask WARNER if his Minutemen
unit in Bogalusa was in any way associated with the national
organization of the same naine and also asked WARNER for any
literature on the Minutemen so that he, COONE, could give

“it to the members of his unit. WARNER stated that the

Minutemen in Bogalusa are associated with the national
organization of the same name but did not have any literature
to give to COONE as this was another way in which the FBI
could check on the members. .

WARNER added that a second Minutemen unit has
been started in Bogalusa by ALBERT APPLEWHITE and this
unit has 10 members, not further identified, and their \
first project was placing a dead animal on the back porch
of RALPH BLUMBERG's residence who is also the owner of
radio station WBOX, Bogalusa.

WARNER stated that in the past Klan leaders. have

had to use a great deal of persuasion on "JELLY" POUNDS ,
