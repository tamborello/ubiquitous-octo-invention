of the election and,although there was a great deal of
pressure to do something about it, I don't recall our finding
any way that we could have done it.

Q- Do you recall that there was..a: specific direction

from the President that you not advise the Secretary of

 
 
 

State of this request from the White House?. Do you ever
recall that being done?

A No, I don't recall his saying it in this connection
but, Mr. Belin, let me just say that this was a favorite
device of President Nixon. Don't tell so and so. Be sure
you keep this secret. So I am not questioning the fact that
he might very well have said it. On the other hand, I don't
‘recall it in this connection.

Q In what connection do you recall his telling you
not to tell the Secretary of State about it?

A Oh, I think these were things having to do with

dait dadod "a GTwase5 FHL WOUd AdODOLOHA

Vietnam and Southeast Asia,as best I recall.

Q Do you recall his ever telling you not to tell any~
thing about this particular subject involving Chile to
_the Forty Committee?

A No. I don't remember that.

Q I assume that if the President would have told you

not to tell the Secretary of State, you would have followed: '

the direction of the President.

 

A Oh, of course.

Q And if he told you not to tell the Forty Committee

you would have followed his direction on that?

A Yes. After all, these devices are part of his
office.
Q And if he told you not to tell the President's

 
 
 

direction there?

A Yes. I think there would be no question about it.

He was my boss.

Q And if he told you not to tell Congressional over-

A I never recall having discussed that with him, not
informing. the Congress. I don't recall any conversations of

that kind.

Q Well, if he would have told you that -<

A. Nor: do I recall any conversations about the
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. If you
have evidence that he asked me not to tell them something
I won't challenge it but the President's Foreign Advisory
Board quite frankly, never loomed in his mind large enough

to be, I don't think, as a considered factor.

Q The Committee was not performing a true oversight

function. Would that be a fair statement? ran

Q Yes.

with the Agency of the development or discussions of any plans
concerning the possible assassination of Patrice Lumumba? -

A. I don't recall anything about any plans to assassinate
Patkice Lumumba « I know that Lumumba was a controversial figure
at the time, I know whatever year this was -= was in the
Eisenhower or the Kennedy era that Lumumba was riding high.

Q I believe that the era would have been in the era of
1959, '60, I believe he was killed in early ‘61.

A I remember later hearing all kinds of allegations
about Lumumba and how he had been killed and why he had been
killed. I remember also the fagt that the -- it was abundantly
clear that the Agency had had nothing to do with his demise
but whether there was a plot on the Agency at sometime or
another to try to bring about his demise I was not familiar wit
it. I want to say here I will obviously do the very best t
can with my recollection but when you consider how much has bee
in the newspapers about a number of things in the last period o
years it is pretty hard to stick in time when you first heard
about something. .

All I am trying to convey here is I was not as far as I
know privy to any ongoing plan to get rid of Patrice Lumumba

by assassination.

Qa Now, the dictator of the Dominican Republic, Mr. an

Trujillo, was killed on or about May 30, '61. Prior to that

time were you aware of the fact that there had been a request |
