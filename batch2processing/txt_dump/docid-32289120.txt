“NO $33 advised on May 14 and 21, 1964, that he hia”
received information that CARLOS MARCELLO had ‘an interest ina
gambling casino that had recently opened in the British Grand
Bahamas. This source stated he did not know if it were true,. |
|

 

but. that MARCELLO had once had a casino in Guatemala and therefore
should have sufficient contact to set himself up in a casino in the
Bahamas. Source advised that he had no details regarding either
‘casino. The source advised that some local gambling contacts were
trying to obtain work in the Grand Bahamas and it was through these
sources that he had obtained this information.

   
 

  
 

 
  

 
  

ATTEM OF MARCELLO
PARISH SHERIFF'S OFFICE

On June 8, 1964, NO T-32 advised that approximately. one
month previously he arrived in New Orleans and approached VICTOR
MARCELLO, whom he had met in the past years through his former

_ wife. -He told VICTOR MARCELLO that he was presently unemployed,
-having spent the last six months on a farm at Pine Hill, Alabama,
(which is true) and was desirous of getting with someone where he
could make some quick money. VICTOR MARCELLO referred him to.
CARLOS MARCELLO and NO T-32 went to the Town and Country Motel,
1225 Airline Highway, Metairie, Louisiana. ;NO T-32 stated that he
told CARLOS that he had been referred to him by VICTOR MARCELLO
and he was, as he had told VICTOR, desirous of making some. quick
money.- . ;

NO T-32 said that CARLOS told him to check into the Town.
and Country Motel and he would consider giving him something to do.
Approximately two weeks ago, after several conversations with
CARLOS MARCELLO, CARLOS told him to go to ALWYN CRONVICH, newly
elected Jefferson Parish Sheriff, and apply for a position as
deputy sheriff, CARLOS stated that he wanted to infiltrate the
Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office so that he would be aware of
what was going on there. , NO T-32 stated he has informed CARLOS
as well as CRONVICH that he had formerly worked furnishing infor-
mation to the FBI, as well as having been a police officer and .
having worked for several county solicitors"offices in the State
of Alabama. He stated he also told CRONVICH that the latter
could check him out through the FBI.

On Thursday, June 4, 1964, upon the suggestion of CARLOS
MARCELLO, © NO T-32 returned to” CRONVICH to determine what happened
to his application for employment and was told by CRONVICH that he
was still checking and, in addition, was having some ‘trouble with
thé parish officials in that they wanted him to limit his
employees to individuals from within Jefferson Parish. CRONVICH
told NO T-32 that he would be able to give him a definite answer

> as to his~ employment with him within three weeks.

“NO “‘T-32 stated that he reported this back to CARLOS
MARCELLO and CARLOS told him that he was satisfied. CARLOS” also
told NO T-32 that the three parish commissioners from the area
known as the West Bank were. all his men and that he "owned" the
Highway Patrol from the top down. NO T-32 stated that he has ©
received no bill for his living quarters.and further he has made
telephone calls to individuals, and from conversations he has”
had with CARLOS MARCELLO and another individual who works where
NO T-32 lives, whom NO T-32 does not know and who advised him he
was not the son of CARLOS MARCELLO but that CARLOS MARCELLO had
raised him, that CARLOS MARCELLO receives a report on each
telephone call that NO T-32 makes.

NO T-32 advised he felt that CARLOS MARCELLO already
controls Sheriff CRONVICH to an extent. He stated that he bases . oo
this belief on two things: :

’ CARLOS MARCELLO made the statement to him that when

CRONVICH was seeking election, CRONVICH sent word to
MARCELLO asking MARCELLO what he wanted in the event CRONVICH
weré elected and, according to NO T-32, CARLOS MARCELLO stated,
"Not a G...-D... thing."

2. When NO T-32 was last at the Sheriff's Office
to discuss his prospéctive employment with CRONVICH,
he saw another individual whom he has seén in contact with
CARLOS MARCELLO, at the Sheriff's Office. NO T-32 stated he
was not sure whether this individual was working at the Sheriff's
Office or just another individual in the same position as he,
that is, applying for employment.

NO T-32 stated that on the morning of June 8, 1964,
CARLOS MARCELLO asked him if he could get any information from
the FBI at Mobile, Alabama, and NO 7-32 replied in the affirma-
tive, stating he felt that he could. MARCELLO then requested.
NO T-32 to determine anything derogatory about a hit-and-run
