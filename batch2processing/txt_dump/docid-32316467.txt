was blinded when acid was thrownin his face, presumably
by the deceased, ABRAHAM TELVI. The subject, CARLINO,
along with others, was held as a material witness in this
matter, Also involved in this case was JOHN DIOGUARDI.
This matter was never brought to trial due to a change in
the testimony of the major witnesses in this case.

It 1s to be noted that several individuals,
whose reliability is not known, have stated in the past,
that the subject, CARLINO, is a "button man", however, none
have advised to what "family" subject belongs, Because
of subject's clese association with some of the members of
the THOMAS LUCEESE "family", the subject :isfor the present,
being carried with that group,
