Page 2

Page 25 - On 12/28/59, a few days before the fall of the
Batista government in Cuba, Artime joined
Castro's 26th of July Movement. He did not
previously participate in the revolution
against Batista and in no way participated
in Batista's overthrow.

According to one source, Artime, while in
prison in 1961-62, was in no way considered a
leader by members of Brigade 2506 and had no
great amount of prestige among them.

Page 26 - Artime and Miro Cardona on speaker's stand with
President Kennedy at Orange Bowl Stadium,
12/29/62. This added greatly to his prestige.

Page 32 - In late January 1963, Miro Cardona, head of CRC,
tried to overthrow MRR leadership of Artime.

Page 38 - In May 1963, Artime and other leading Cuban
exiles were planning to publish a document

Batista Falla were in Nicaragua as guest of
dictator Luis Somoza to discuss training bases
to be set up in that country.

between U.S., Nicaragua and Costa Rica, recruits

He has more than $5 million worth of equipment

Page 83 - As of February 1965, MRR of Manuel Artime had
‘a small base in the Dominican Republic, MRR
attack a Spanish merchant vessell off Cuba and
set it afire. Raid made with full knowledge of
CIA who completely backed MRR.

Page 92 - Source advised on 9/23/65 that general opinion
of Cuban exiles indicated Manuel Ray of JURE
and Manuel Artime of MRR were no longer considered
leaders in the anti-Castro movement.

Page 96 - On.3/7/66, Artime advised that MRR office was in
his home and the group was relatively inactive
