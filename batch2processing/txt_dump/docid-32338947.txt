her WADC uniform, appeared in the hos Angeles Evening Herald and Express
March 5, 1942..: Two of these full length pictures are being retained in
the file for identification purposes. CA, )-

'* Also during the’ period of this report it has come to the.
attention of the Los Angeles Office that GALE SONDERGAARD was one of
many: people from the movie industry who sent telegrams to the president
of Mexico objecting to his proposed deportation of several Spanish chil-
dren between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one. ‘The People's World.
described these Spaniards as being anti<Fascist and conducted a cam=
paign urging American citizens to wire the president of Mexico in their
behalf «

Further, Confidential National Defense. Informant L.A #357
advised the writer that ED ROBBIN, known Communist member and sponsor
of the World Forum, on March 29, 1942, publicly urged the audiencé ‘at
the World Forum to direct "such terms. of intercession to the president
of Mexico on behalf of° these anti-Fascist. people". The fact that GALE
SONDERGAARD also sent one reflects that in this one instance, at least,
she has followed the so-called Communist Party line. MW -

It is further interesting ‘to note in this connection that the
People's World of April 5,. 1942 reflecta that the president of Mexico
granted these Spanish deportees one year of grace for their final depor-
tation.

: on March 10, 1942 DIMITRI TIOMKIN and BIBERMAN held a “conference
and TIOMKIN advised BIBERMAN that JANE and he had just called New York: to
determine through the Russian War Relief offices there if it would be pos-
sible to get Madame LITVINOV or DOROTHY THOMPSON for the rally. DIMITRI’.
stated that she had talked to MORRIS (general administrator of Russian War

Relief in New York) and MORRIS advised sending a telegram to Madamé LITVINOV
‘with many prominent names on it and maybe she would come, TIOMKIN stated
that he had also talked with EDWARD CARTER, whom, he stated, had pneumonia
and was dangerously ill. CARTER had told JANE, TIOMKIN stated, that. TIOMKIN
was the person who could induce Madame LITVINOV to. cotie if anyone could, ;
DIMITRI then told BIBERMAN that he and JANE had tried to call .someone, ‘ap=
parently ey LITVINOV, "But that she would not be in until tomorrow.

morning". :) (4)
‘“PIMITRI also stated that DAVID FARIES, president of the Russian

_ War Relief Association of Southern. California, had ‘promised to ‘take the
responsibility to get the big names . and to send Madame LITVINOV. a aye

'- BIBERMAN then asked DIMITRI what he was doing about the letters,
, apparently referring to letters written to prominent people encouraging
them to donate to this campaign. DIMITRI told him that everything was go-
: ‘ing fine and that HARRY BENNETT, Russian War Relief publicity director, was
attempting to get in the studio and also planning a radio program. BIBER-
\ MAN told TIOMKIN thatthe fact that CARTER and MORRIS were so enthusiastic
: , should. give DIMITRI a great deal of encouragement. DIMITRI further. advised
HERBERT that JANE was attempting to plan a reception for a certain Tady, |
a who apparently is rather well respected, and after some lengthy conversa~
: tion with Mrs. RATHBORNE to have her.as hostess or to act in some capacity
for this event; however, this informant was unable. to. obtain sufficient .

BIBERUAN, in further consultations with BRIS; stated that ‘nthe think

“that PARLE'S book is ‘the best. ‘ "They" undoubtedly refers to. the Russian -
Gonsulate at Los Angeles, with whom it is evident BIBERMAN discussed - the

matter prior to referring HARRIS to the proper book. Hence! it would ap-

pear that at least in this particular instance BIBERMAN was the go-between

in procuring Russian propaganda for a scéript, ‘which will probably be. pro="

duced as a movie, ‘Should BIBERMAN be further affiliated-in either procir+

ing other background for’ this proposed script or should he in any way be- |

come concerned with it further, at will be developed in subsequent reports colt

During the period of this report GALE SONDERGAARD had been con=
tacted by members of two'Communist front organizations « ‘and invited to lec=
ture to them. On March 1, 1942 FREDA FONTIVITZ. (phonetic), telephone
CHarleston 6-6594, contacted HERBERT BIBERMAN and advised him that she re-
presented the Hollywood Womens Council and wanted GALE to give a lecture
entitled "Women in’ Defense" in-one of the series. of chain luncheons which
was to be held the following Saturday. at 2:00 P. M, At this meeting, FONTI-
\VITZ stated, one hundred arid fifty ladies would be present, including four
of the Russian medical aides. GALE later. recontacted FONTIVIT2Z and advised
she could not make a personal appearance at thig, meeting, stating she’ had
a first aid class et the same hour on Saturday, 6-3 2) (U)

Again on March 2,7 1942 ‘nam SCHWARTZ contacted GALE and asked
her if she would speak at a women's mass meeting on Brooklyn Avenue“'on ¢
March 8. HANNA advised GALE that there would be a number of IWO clubs
present. and several other organizations. , She asked GALE to speak on the
subject of ‘Women's place in the World". GALE advised HANNA that she would
check her schedule to see if she could make this appearance and requested
HANNA to contact her later on the same day; however, when. HANNA recontacted
“GALE, GALE stated she had talked to her husband and "Jt seems we are. occu~
pied that evening so I can't accept the invitation. ju ms

The file entitled "COMMUNIST PARTY, Los ANGELES AREA", number
100-1763, reflects that one HANNA SCHWARTZ. ts the wife of ‘LOUIS SCHWARTZ, ..

“president of. the Newsboys Union ~ ‘CIO, who is prominently connected with the

Comaunist Party in Los Angeles. Confidential Naticnal Defense Informant
L.A. #150, whose identity has been made known to the Bureau, has advised
this office that HANNA SCHWARTZ is also an active member of: the Los Angeles
Communist Party and a close friend of PETTIS PERRY, chairman of the Los.
Angeles County Communist Party. She is also a member of the Executive
Committee of the Los Angeles Auxiliary: Council. of: the CIO and is"a.member
of the committee of th Consumers “Union and als6- ivery active in’ the American
Peace Mobilization, ur. 7 .

Attention is invited to the fact that this. HANNA SCHWARTZ may be
. the oné who consulted with GALE SONDERGAARD : and it is further noted that .
BIBERMAN consulted with GALE before she gave a final decision in the mat-
‘ter, lending credence to the belief that BIBERMAN wishes not. only himself
but. his wife to remain in the background of known Communist contacts and (u)
organizations, GALE SONDERGAARD is still active in the Womens ‘Ambulance oa
