contemplated gambling casino would be the big problem
as they feel the customers would be stopped from
leaving the shores of the United States.

MM 744-c advised that the Surfside Six Floating
Homes became a Florida Corporation in 1960, and the
officers are LAWRENCE VITA, President, RALPH WEIDLER,
Vice President and LOUIS RONES, Treasurer. RONES is an
accountant and has no financial interest in the business.
WEIDLER for the past eleven years has been doing’ sub-
contracting work under his own name at Levittown,
Pennsylvania, and prior to that did sub-contracting work
for Levitt & Sons in New York City for eleven years and
before that he was construction superintendent for Levitt
& Sons. This source pelated the Surfside Six Floating
Homes, Inc., maintains an average medium four to low
five figure balance at the bank, has a secured loan of five
figures and pays its obligations from prompt to sixty
days slow. He also related VITA is allegedly single and
about 4% years old. >

It should be noted the proposed "Atlantis
Isle" gambling casino is allegedly a multi-million dollar
venture, and the operation of the Surfside Six Floating
Homes indicates a large amount of the money would have
to come from other sources.

MM 509-C-TE also reported that he received
information that JOHN TRONOLONE (MM 92-455) is no longer
bookmaking, that he turned his customers over to EDDIE
GOLD, but secures a certain per cent of the amount his
old customers lose. According to his information, TRONOLONE
is now shylocking and playing:.gards at the Patio Bridge
Club, Miami Beach. SbECIVE IMA i
