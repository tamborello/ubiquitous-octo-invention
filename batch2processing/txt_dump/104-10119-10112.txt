Attached is a copy of ‘a cable which was brought to my attention by
Mr. O'Neal, CI/SIG.,..Mr. Horton had requested that Mr. O'Neal check
“concerning: any information ‘developed by the Office: of Security. . .

 

- The attached cable. indicates that Subject is furnishin Anformation
‘of a. -type, which he should not bé furnishing, | to certain

omeiale whom he presumably: knew during previous assignment ‘in .

 

   

The cable also appears.to raise the question concerning how :
Subject could recently purchase. a.$70, 000 home in “Washington, D. CG. :-
A check of Subject file indicates that Subject has some outside income -
since he has written a mumnber of “pocket | books" and has certain
corporation stocks.

The following Security action is | Fecommended:

 
  
  
  

 

D. C. area and information obtained in regard tohis —
indicated purchase. “o£ a home. Ancluding financial arxani ements.

  

‘Appropriate officials. of. J. RC be briefed concerning the a
information pias ob dadiscreetinguiry ae os
made concerning whether Subject.is making.othey indiscreet _ .
‘remarks and statements concerning his current aseignment.

 

 

Subject has been a problem j in the past and apparently continues to be
a problem. If information can be obtained other than the cable information
which apparently could not be used, it is felt that Subject should be given
at least.a strong warning concerning indiscreet remarks and unauthorized

disclosure of information.
