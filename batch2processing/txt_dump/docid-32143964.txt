advised by SA CURTIS that any FBI interest in LANE was unknown
to him. ALEXANDER then commented that he had known for several

' LANE is not considered advisable, inasmuch as ALEXANDER was a
somewhat controversial figure in connection with the investigation
concerning the leak of information to the press concerning OSWALD's 7
i diary during the course of the assassination investigation, a
