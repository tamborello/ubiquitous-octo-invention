informant agreed to tell interviewing agents his
present financial plans after expressing deep concern about
not letting anyone "foul him up" as he is very anxious to make
a financial comeback, Stated that he is now working on a
"deal" with ABE BENJAMIN of Las Vegas. BENJAMIN has located
some young Italian who was working in Las Vegas as a shill,
but who is apparently some kind of a homemade engineering
genius’. He is an inventor and has put together a gambling
machine which they hope to manufacture and place in Nevada
casinos. Apparently the machine utilizes old horse racing
movies. The horse racing movies are projected on a screen,
The players insert their coin, pick the horse they think
will win, and then the machine is started and the one who
has picked the winning horse will be paid off like a winner
at a jackpot machine. They have one machine manufactured
now and it cost approximately $20,000. ABE BENJAMIN has
invested $14,000 to date and someone referred to by the
informant. as DAN WILSON of Los Angeles has invested $18,000.
WILSON, (believed to be an Italian with another true. name),
apparently is the west coast representative for some well.
known garbage disposal manufacturer in St. Louis. Informant
indicated he was well known in the garbage disposal manufacturing
line. Informant stated that he as well as FRATIANNO are also
among the investors although neither have put up any cash,
but have apparently promised to arrange for necessary financing
if the machine is suecessful., The machine will be manufactured
in Chicago and informant indicated the Chicago LCN Family
would provide the financing.

 

 

(If the Las Vegas Division can discreetly verify
the above without compromising the identity of the informant
in any way or incurring his displeasure for hurting him financially
by inquiry, it is requested that any pertinent information along
these lines be furnished to the San Diego Office.)

long been out of politics.

  

VIII, SAN_FRANCISCO

Stated he is in frequent contact with JIMMY FRATIANNO
of Sacramento. FRATIANNO has rented his home in Las Vegas for
$130 with the agreement that he can use a bedroom there whenever
he is in Las Vegas. States FRATIANNO still has ten or eleven
trucks working on whatever jobs he can pick up. That LA PORTE's
trucks have been repossessed and they are attempting to sell
them for $7,500 each, States FRATIANNO incurred a $10,000 lawyer's
fee with attorney JAMES CANTILLION of Los Angeles who represented

attorney fees and was not subsidized by the LCN.

putting out a contract on FRATIANNO, and it was only after
the informant's strong objections the contract was not issued.

Informant stated he has had three meetings with his
Capo, JOE ADAMO, in San Diego, attempting to arrange a meeting
with Los Angeles LCN Boss, FRANK DESIMONE, but that to date
DESIMONE has avoided the meeting. He still intends to "cut
into" NICK SIMPONIS' gambling operations on the outskirts of
Palm Springs, but that he cannot do it without first clearing
with his boss. Does not expect to get clearance from DESIMONE
and will use this as another example to show DESIMONE's lack
of leadership.

Stated that he has recently been advised that the
Los Angeles LCN leadership is considering issuing a contract
calling for the death of someone. The victim apparently lives
in the Los Angeles agea. Two men have already been designated
as the ones who will do the killing and hw successful
completion of the job, they apparently will be considered for
LCN membership. The meeting has been under consideration for
three or four months. Informant's "Capo", JOE ADAMO, at
San Diego, has indicated to the informant that he has been
picked to supervise the two men conducting the hit in order

to insure it is done successfully.

sit down meeting with DESIMONE and Underboss NICK LICATA and

the hit men caught in the act before the killing and then use |
them against DESIMONE and LICATA in ordem to depose them from
their LCN positions of leadership. He stated that all develo)
in wong regard will be immediately furnished to the interviewing

Los Angeles by himself on June 5, 1967, to consult with the

informant about the extradition charge he faces in Florida.

to him as a "bug man" who can turn off ADT alarm systems.

States he is now living in North Hollywood, California, and

that he claims to own a ten unit apartment house in North Hollywood

to sell his apartment house now and that if he can raise the

money, he would still like informant to go to Florida and attempt

to arrange through LCN Boss SANTO TRAFFICANTE to have the Florida
charge dropped. 2

Informant stated he is agreeable to this trip only
4f VELOTTA can come up with his plane fare and a little expense
money so that he will not arouse anyone's suspicions as they
all know he is broke.

IL. DETROIT LCN FAMILY

 

In regard to background on formation of the Detroit
Family, talked in general terms about the bootlegging, gang
fighting between themselves, until finally the Detroit Family
as it is today emerged as a result of an alliance and that to
his knowledge the Detroit Family is run by JOE ZERILLI, JOHN
PRIZIOLA, and BLACK BILL TOCCO, with ZERILLI making ali the
final decisions. Stated PETE LICAVOLI of Tucson is still
active’ in Detroit Family affairs and is consulted.

Stated Detroit attorney BILL BUFFALINO, to his
knowledge, is not an LCN member. Believed he was married
to FRANK MELI's daughter - a niece of LCN member, ANGELO
MELI. Informant stated BUFFALINO was hand picked by the
Detroit Family to work with JIMMY HOFFA and that BUFFALINO is
a legal and business consultant with the Detroit Family
leadership, especially in regard to Teamster loans.

In regard to PAPA JOHN PRIZIOLA, informant stated
he is back in Detroit and is in fairly good shape after his
recent heart trouble while in San Diego. Believes from talking
to PRIZIOLA's sons-in-law, JOE AND FRANK MATRANGA in San Diego,
there have been some subpoenas issued in Detroit which have
been brought to PRIZIOLA's attention. Informant did not know
the nature of the subpoenas, but believes they have been served
on some of the LCN members in that area.

Believes the Detroit Family to date has kept all of
the points in the New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas, which has
cost the Detroit Family around five million dollars and that
at the present time they are attempting to raise an additional
$400,000,

VIL. NEW YORK

Stated he has not heard of any change in the physical
condition of Boss TOM LUCHESE,.

 
 

In regard to JOE BONNANO, informant claimed his son
had arranged for the kidnapping and the kidnapping was a "phony”
which only a few people knew about. Informant denied having
any intimate knowledge of BONNANO's "kidnapping". Informant
stated he has received no official word through LCN circles
that BONNANO has been received back into the LCN in good
standing. ;

Informant talked in a way to indicate a distinct
relationship between the Los Angeles LCN Family and the Family
headed by TOM LUCHESE in New York. Described how several
years ago he and JACK I. DRAGNA, deceased Los Angeles LCN
Boss, had decided with some of the other "Capos" that they
did not want anything to do with narcotics, Stated DRAGNA
was opposed to narcotics and his main argument was that the
LCN hoodlums had children of their own who might become
involved as addicts. DRAGNA and informant apparently were
upset over the use of the Baja California, Mexico, Border by

‘LCN narcotic activity. He described how he and DRAGNA

personally went back to New York to present their ideas to
LUCHESE for LUCHESE to present to the Commission. The way the
informant phrased his words indicated a special relationship
With the LUCHESE family.

The informant reminisced about past LON activities
in the New York area. Described how DUTCH SCHULTZ was going
to kill THOMAS DEWEY years ago when DEWEY was an Assistant
District Attorney and that LUCKY LUCIANO stopped SCHULTZ and
DEWEY knew about it. Informant indicated SCHULTZ was killed
over this and that DEWEY knew he owed his life to LUCIANO and
that this was the main reason LUCIANO was freed and deported
when DEWEY became Governor.

In regard to the informant's statement of a past
U, S. Senator from New York being an LCN member, he stated
that on thinking it over, he might have been wrong and it
might have been a U. 8S, Congressman from New York rather than
a Senator. He claimed he has forgotten his name, but that
when he next meets with FRATIANNO, he will bring up the
subject to get the name identified. In any event he indicated
