entered the U.S. under PL 110. :

 

2.  Subject's last known address was 2931 SW 19th Terrace,
Miami, Florida, telephone (305) 443-3027. Henry S. PACHANKIS (P}j,
a career associate assigned to LA/Miami Station was Subject's

“contact in the Miami area. PACHANKIS attempted to locate
Subject; however, the telephone had been disconnected and a
‘visit to Subject's residence revealed that he had moved and
left no forwarding address. The post office box established
for Subject's use was serviced and there was na communication
from Subject notifying us of his change of address. and/or phone
number. 9

 

. 3. The HSCA considers their interview with Subject to be
extremely important and your assistance in locating the where-
abouts of Subject through your Miami office on a priority basis
would be most appreciated. It. is requested that no contact be
made with Subject when his whereabouts is ascertained since we
prefer to have someone whose bona fides is established contact
him and arrange for the HSCA interview. —
