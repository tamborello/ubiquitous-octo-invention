600 E Street NW, 2nd Floor

Dear Mr. Marwell:

This is in reference to your August il ; 1997, letter in which. you forwarded documents
concerning Declan Ford,*William Gaudet, and Gerald Patrick Hemming for our determination on
the release of information to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board.

Postponement under Section 6(3) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act of 1992 applies to the records of Declan Ford, William Gaudet, and Gerald
Patrick Hemming. We have redacted personal information which if released would be an
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Postponement under Section 6(4) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act of 1992 also applies to the records of Gerald Patrick Hemming. This information
compromises the existence of an understanding of confidentiality currently requiring protection
between a Government agent and a cooperating individual, and public disclosure would be so
harmful that it outweighs the public interest.

Document #7 regarding Gerald Patrick Hemming contains information that originated with the —
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); therefore; we have referred the document to the CIA for
review. You will be notified of the results of that determination. In addition, documents #8 and
#30-32 originated with or contained information that originated with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI). The FBI will notify you of the results of its review.

Document #48 regarding William Gaudet contains information that appears to have originated
from the the Official Personnel Folder. Therefore, we have returned this document to the FBI

for referral to the appropriate office.

Sincerely,

WA hal

Re: Office of Personnel Management Equities in the Records of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation Subject To The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act

1992, 44US.C.§ 2107
Dear Office of Personnel Management: .

The staff of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board has identified a
number of FBI documents that we intend to present to the Review Board for review of
postponements at the Review Board meeting on October 14 and 15, 1997. Among the
documents we identified are documents in which your agency has equities. These
documents are identified in the enclosed form. .

Weare identifying these documents to you now so that you can decide whether you .
wish to postpone release of the information in question. Please keep in mind the
provisions of the JFK Act which anticipate that information will be withheld from
public release only in “the rarest cases” and only pursuant to one of the provisions of
Section 6 of the Act.

So that we may adequately prepare our presentation to the Review Board with the
benefit of any submission you may wish to make, you must submit evidence or
arguments in support of any postponements you choose to assert in writing no later
than October 1, 1997. If you do not respond to this letter by the above deadline, we
will assume that your agency intends to release in full its equities in the FBI record at
issue, and we will recommend that the Review Board vote to release in full your
agency’s equities in the record.
