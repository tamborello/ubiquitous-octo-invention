Ray withdrew from the CRC shortly after the Bay of Pigs
invasion. In a Miami new conference on May 28, 1961, he said
the major reason for the MRP break with the CRC was that the
council had failed to live up to the written promises given
it in March, outlining conditions Ray had insisted upon before
joining the organization. twydines 5/28/61, One Cuban. Group
Quits Exile Body by Sam Pope Brewer) The first condition had
been that the council was to give first priority to the under-
ground fighters in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs invasion.
Secondly, Ray had insited that anyone too closely associated with
the Batista regime would not be used in the invasion and
lastly, he was to have been allowed prior approval before
any military leader of the invasion was named. {ibsa) Ray told
the assembled newsmen that his program to overthrow Castro
was based on maximum mobilization of the discontented people
inside Cuba and that the leadership of this underground should
come from Cubans who could prove they had such a potential

to be allowed to plan its own operations and broaden its base

of financial support to include sympathetic Latin American

made against him and the MRP bacause of their leftist ideologies.
