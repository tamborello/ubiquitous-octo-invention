ISRAEL EPSTEIN is reported to be closely associated
with TANG Ming-chao the founder of the "China Daily News" and
also a contact of the subject. TANG has been reported to be ha
head of political intelligenee in English spesking countries
for the Chinese Communists.

The subject, in discussing the arrest of EPSTEIN
and the purging of RITTENBERG, has dated that she tends to
discredit the stories but she has also tended to take the
Chinese Communists position by stating that some people have
trouble keeping the right line. This is another indication
of the subject's dedication and loyalty to the Chinese
Communists.

It would appear that the subject's impending trip \
to London is not a vacation trip because she is traveling a-
long. It is to be noted that in all the subject's trips
abroad she has always: stopped in London.

It would appear from the above that if the subject
has any communication with the Chinese Communists this com-
munication is through London, _England.

Proposed Future Investigation

ne Because of the connection between the subject and
person or persons unknown in London, England, it is felt that
coverage should be given to her activities while in London.

The NYO by relet of 6/12/68, has requested the Buréau
to seek the cooperation of the British Security Service in
giving coverage to the subject's activities in London.($) .

The NYO is remaining alert for information furnished
by NY 4.04.7-S* which would reveal the identity of contacts
of the subject who could be developed as informants in this
matter.

As the subject becomes more active in the SDS it
is felt that informants, active in this organization,can be
targeted against her. i
