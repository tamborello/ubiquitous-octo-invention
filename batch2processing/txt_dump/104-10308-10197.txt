SSOSTEEL 1 reported the following on the probabl¢g
reaction of Fidel CASTRO and his principal associates to the

Soviet withdrawal of offensive missiles from Cuba and to U.S.
demands re the withdrawal of Soviet IL-28 aircraft and on-spot
inspection: Source said that CASTRO's vanity was immense and no
matter how it had been explained to him by MIKOYAN or other Soviet
officials, he.must have been furious at the fact that the Soviet
Union had "backed down" before the U.S. and was negotiating with

the U.S. on an independent basis. ~CASTRO must have considered
himself as being in a desperate situation. Source said that

CASTRO was dominated by vanity, had megalomaniacal tendencies, and
possessed a compulsion for revenge which was notorious; on occasion
his compulsion caused him to reach back as far as twenty years to
revenge actions taken against him at that time. Source added that
in the current situation CASTRO was fully capable of undertaking

an act of desperation, for example the aerial bombardment of the
U.S. or some gross act against the Soviet Ambassador in Cuba.

persuasiveness and took action which resulted in shooting down a
U-2 plane. The Soviet command was furious and the Soviet officer
was teturned to the USSR under arrest.

’ {COMMENT: Ref. IG Memo dated 25 April 1967 SECRET
EYES ONLY, Page 112 - Discussion of Assassination at High-Level
Government Meetings. HURWITCH of State, and McGeorge BUNDY, White
House, among others, attended 10 Aug 62 Special Group (Augmented)
meeting at Dept. of State. Bill Harvey attended with McCone for
CIA. Remember Harvey's Mafia contacts. Also, keep in mind that
Tad SZULC allegedly had access to Hurwitch, both President and
Attorney General Kennedy, and McGeorge Bundy. Could he have
learned or heard of the plot and let the word out? McCone recalled
that liquidation of CASTRO, and other regime officials, was
mentioned at JCS op room meeting 8 or 9 August 1962. It was
later determined that McCone's recollection was probably faulty,
that assassination came up for discussion at the 10 August State
meeting. 7
