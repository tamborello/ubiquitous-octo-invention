/ It is noted that on 6/29/61 agents of IRS, Pittsburgh, took

part in what the press alleged was a nationwide series of
raids on gamblers. Local IRS agents concentrated their raids
at about 2:00 PM in the Turtle Creek Valley section of
Allegheny County, about 10 miles East of Pittsburgh, appre-
hending some 25 small numbers operators.

The MANNARINOS knew of the impending raids by IRS agents at

9:30 AM on 6/29/61, several hours before the raids occured.

This information was relayed quickly to all numbers writing
and/or horse bookies who turn in to the MANNARINOS throughout
the New Kensington-Arnold-Vandergrift, Pa., area. Apparently
the MANNARINOS did not know where the IRS agents would raid,
merely that raids would come off. . Sre-naw 11 (a) wv
