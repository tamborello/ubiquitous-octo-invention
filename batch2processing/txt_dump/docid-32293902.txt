SUBJECT: CARLOS MARCELLO, aka;
. SA PATRICK J. COLLINS, JR. - VICTIM
AFO oO

New Orleans, confidentially advised 11/20/67 that he had a
private discussion with Federal District Judge FREDERICK J. R.¢&
HEEBE, EDLA. ~ . SI

USA LOUIS C. LACOUR, Eastern District of Louisiana, |

m

‘Judge HEEBE advised that he is transferring cy
captioned case to Laredo, Texas, for trial. Judge HEEBE is \
refraining from making his decision public until such time x
as he has determined the best method of conducting the <
transfer without raising the question of "reversible error" SS
on his part. Judge HEEBE pointed out to USA LACOUR that  »
MARCELLO had raised an issue hitherto unraised in law when (}
he filed a motion for change of venue and then attempted to
vescind the motion. ,

 

 

Judge HEEBE feels that MARCELLO, no matter what
happens, will appeal on the grounds that he has a right to
be tried in the jurisdiction where the offense occurred, as
per the 6th Amendment to the Constitution. Judge HEEBE
stated that under the 6th Amendment, MARCELLO also has the
‘pight to a fair and impartial trial and MARCELLO claimed, at
the hearing, that he could not get a fair and impartial trial
due to Life magazine articles relative to him and subsequent
statements by the Louisiana Governor.
