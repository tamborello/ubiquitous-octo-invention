Trash Collection Contract

By airtel dated February 6, 1958, the Miami Division
advised that DANIEL P. SULLIVAN, Operating Manager, Miami
Crime Commission, had advised on February 5, 1953, that he
personally, in a very discreet manner, ascertained that the
gerbage and trash contracts for Miami, Miami Beach and Dade
County, Fla., are being handled by municipal employees and
that thesc three municipalitics domt contemplate making
any contracts regarding garbage and trash handling to any
private interprises or contractors.

The Miami Division also advised that no inguiry
would be made at the Golden Nuzgct Motel, Miami Beach, Fla.,
unless advised to the contrary, in view of the fact the Golden
Nugget Motel is a known hoodlum hangout and the possibility
exists the incouiry would reach BRUNO and have an cffect on
negotiations of BRUNO, Philadclphia Confidential Informant
T-19 and others involved in the garbage and trash contract.

On February 18, 1958, Philadelphis Confidential
Informnt T-10 idontificd tho Senator from Floride, previously
rofcrred to by him as "Senator MORRIS," eas being Florida's
Statc Senator JOSEPH BATON. The informant insists that the

Fla., which includes Miami and Miami Beach, for both commer-
eial and residential. T-10 stated he did not know who the
Attorney HAFT or Senator EATON would contact to obtain such
a contract. He stated that necessary negotiations are being
handled by the Italian eloment, apparently through BEN
GALLUP (phonetic).

By airtel dated March 19, 1958, the Miami Division
advised that DAVID GIASS, FBI #3733099, formerly from Phila-
delphia, and the present owner afid operator of the Golden

in connection with another mattor. GIASS advised thet he
knows BRUNO and that BRUNO was not registcred at the Golden
Nugeet Motel at that time. GLASS was not receptive to ques-
tions regarding BRUNO; therefore, his association with BRUNO
was not pnrsued any further.
