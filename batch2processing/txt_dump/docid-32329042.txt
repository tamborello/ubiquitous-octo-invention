In connection with the visa application

for the Bahamas, we recently asked for a name check “|

- on the above-named. In reply you kindly ‘supplied me ;
with a report, reference 105-16702 from your Miami ‘

. Florida of figs. dated August 5,2)1968, caption@d “fF o
“4 "adela Maria BATISTA (nee de la Campa y de la TORRE). fe
ae Internal ‘Security - Cuba". . 70S 183015 ; 2 i

2. In the sixth paragraph on the second page an :

\ of this report, reference is made to Laureano BATISTA
“having been"spotted off Racoon Cay, Bahamas on
20 January, 1964:as a result of which the British
frigate H.M.S. Londonderry. was sent to intercept him.

36 The Bahamas Special Branch is unable to trace
any record of this incident having led to BATISTA's \O

arrest, which was how we had interpreted the implication N\,
of this paragraph. We-should be very grateful to know | L
whether this is a correct implication and if any further — \ 0
particulars of this incident are available. ‘ \S

 

3e The importance of this enquiry to the Bahamas NI
Special Branch is that they wish to be in a postion to NI
warn BATISTA and his wife that their involvement with ™
anti-CASTRO activities is known to the authorities and that i
they must not engage in such activities while they are in-

the Bahamas. If there is evidence of BATISTAS arrest in!

4964 in any Bahamian records they would. of course like to

track it down so that this can be used as the basis of ro 3
such a warning. .

the only information about BATISTA's anti-CASTRO activities a
