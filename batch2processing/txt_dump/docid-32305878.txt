money as well as skim going to Chicago LCN from MOE
DALITZ'! skimming operations after selling casinos to
HOWARD HUGHES, Informant believes that ROSELLI was
involved to the extent that he knew who was getting
the money and the amounts. He believes that ROSELLI
- would have detailed. knowledge regarding skimming in the counting
rooms at the Desert Inn, Stardust, and Sands Hotels. Informant
also believed that ROSELLI, over the years, has "shaken
down" the rich Jews in the Los Angeles and Las Vegas areas
' for a great deal of money.

Informant stated that the. major Jewish hoodlum
element has their own "Jewish mafia" and that in his oe _
opinion, the Chicago, LON Family is probably receiving oe
complaints from the "Jewish mafia" regarding ROSELLI
at this time. Informant explained that if ROSELLI goes
too far in attempting to shake down wealthy Jewish
hoodlums, such as MOE DALITZ, the "Jewish mafia" will have .
to kill ROSELLI themselves, which would be a great insult ‘
to the Chicago LCN as it would indicate they could not Ls
control their ow members .

. concerning ROSELI's attempt to shake down MOE DALITZ
was set forth in referenced Los Angeles letter.
