| oo -’ that MORA stated OSWALD's activities before he went to Russia
and not his activities before he went to Mexico.lK,

SWALD was well known in Russia among the
Americans who were there at the same time as he was and that
he was "not that much of a nut," meaning that he could not
ave undertaken sarghd to assassinate President Kennedy,
X-18 and MEX-194co ‘der that it was MORA's thought that
subject could not have undertaken the asSassination of
President Kennedy alone.

cerning the statement which MORA made toWMEX-18
and MEX-19Ft

 

 

‘ eo As was noted in paragraph 3, page 2, of Mexico City
~. -.” letterhead memorandum dated 3/16/64, MORA did not divulge her
-.. source of her information regarding the impression of OSWALD
gained .b ericans in the Soviet Union. Since X-18 and
MEX-19 9h eard MORA make the statement previously that
she haS corresponded with MARY LOUISE PATTERSON, who has been
-. residing in the Soviet Union, it is these informants’ belief
'. that PATTERSON is the source in Russia who advised that OSWALD
. was well known among Americans there.

   

wv)
! biex-18 and MEX-19¥have advised that they hope to
. determine from MORA further details regarding her previous
“.. statements about OSWALD. ew,
wv)

From information whi chAMEX-18 and MEX-19Fhave oH
learned about MORA becoming a Mexican citizen, it is considered | ot
that if MORA were interviewed, she would be antagonistic Se
because she is strongly aware. AN) rights as a Mexican . cod
,citizen an X-18 and MEX-19h e’ddvised previously that

 

 

 

if any Mexican police attempt to at any time interview her, a
they are going to run into "a tiger." If she were to be - 4
interviewed by the Mexican police or by any representative é
of the United States Government, there are no grounds to ‘

believe that she would be cooperative in any manner and the .~ :
-probability exists that.she would be a eee cor to determine

that she has told only X-18 and MEX-1
this. would expose. these informants. —

, It is noted thavfiex-18 and sox Fete navisea ;
that they are unable to ascertain informati6n from MORA
through direct questions. Whenever a question is made to
MORA, she ceases talking, and the only manner.in which these
informants are able to ascertain data from MORA is to needle
“her, then sit back, and with a sympathetic ear listen to what .
she has to say. : Ss
ef . oe!
X-18 and MEX-19fintend to learn from MORA addi-
tional details in order to answer the pertinent questions
which have arisen, and they intend to pursue vigorously the
objective set forth for them concerning information MORA
.. , has in her possession concerning OSWALD JE fo date these
-<«* " dnformants have not been able to meet with MORA for a two
: . or three day period because of her illness and her other
.. ? preoccupations. Present plans are for them to take MORA .
vo \on a two or three day "vacation" in the first half of April.
_ \As soon as these informants have met with MORA, this will
. be reported immediately, and recommendations will be made
’ as to any additional investigative steps to be taken. U)

oe The reason for Mexico City letterhead memorandum
-- qated 3/16/64, being classified "SECRET" is being detailed
fully as follows: ; ~

Tv letterhead me um was classified "SECRET" -
_.to protectfnx18 and mex 19468 are informants in Mexico
furnishing highly sensitive information involving espionage
and information vital to the internal security of the United 4
States. It is essential that the identities of these informants
be fully protected, especially since they are the only source
which received the information and MORA is not known to have © .
_ discussed the information in the letterhead memorandum with .
anyone else. Under the circumstances, the protection of these |
informants is of paramount interest to the continued operations
of the Bureau in-Mexico, and for thig,reason the letterhead an
memoranduy was classified "SECRET." uw) ae

 

uw)
. This office will continue to direct{WEX-18 and
MEX-19X%to vigorously pursue their proposed contact with MORA
and the results ,will. be: promptly reported to the Bureau.
