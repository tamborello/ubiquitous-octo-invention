UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS — _—-
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

_ Reference is made to the April 28, 1976, letter of the SSC
containing requests for material from the FBI. -

Delivered herewith is material responsive to item number.
seven of that letter which pertains to communications between |
November 22, 1963, and December 31, 1964, from FBI Headquarters
to field offices and Legal Attaches concerning the investigation of the
assassination of President John F, Kennedy, In accordance with the
request, this response does not include isolated communications to -
single offices that relate to particular investigative leads, It contains

‘general investigative instructions which were sent from FBI Head-

quarters,

No response is being made to item four of the April 28, 1976,
letter which requests "All materials reflecting that FBI sources
familiar with activities of the Cuban government, Cuban officials, .
Cuban intelligence, anti-Castro groups, or pro-Castro groups (either
within or without the United States) were questioned during the FBI
investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy." A
search for such materials would involve the review of voluminous
records, which would be impractical. As can be noted in the response
to item seven, instructions were issued for contacts of all informants
and sources, Results of contacts with sources familiar with Cuban and
Castro matters would be scattered throughout not only assassination
files, but numerous other Cuban and Castro files. Additionally, if
questioning of sources produced no pertinent information, if would not
necessarily have been reported to FBI leadquarters by the field offices.

Dear Mr. Miller:

The Select Committee staff has expressed. particular
interest in a review of U. S. policy towards Cuba.beginning
after November 1963 and culminating in a meeting with the
President on 7 April 1964.

In response to the Committee's request, appropriate
files were searched. Understandably, internal drafts on
which final Agency positions were based could not be ~
located. There would be no reason to retain them. It is
our understanding that the Committee staff has already had
access to final Agency papers on this subject as submitted
to the White House.

Furthermore, an Agency officer reviewed with a
Committee staff member the pertinent parts of the files
of DCI John A..McCone who was the most senior, knowledge-
able Agency official involved.in the policy decision..

This letter is to notify you that we believe we have
responded fully to the request.

Sincerely,
