SUBJECT/ SPECIAL INDICES, OF ELECTRONIC
SURVEILLANCES
1 tart
a
PURPOSE: !

The Special Investigative Division and the Domestic
Intelligence Division are maintaining separate special indices of
individuals monitored or mentioned through microphone or telephone
surveillances. Those of the Special Investigative Division contain
names obtained through coverage of criminal matters. Those of the
Domestic Intelligence Division contain names obtained through
coverage of internal security matters. The purpose of this memo-
randum is to recommend that these two special indices be consolidate
and operated py tne Files and Communivativis Division. 1

BACKGROUND:

In accordance with the Director's instructions, special
indices were established in October, 1966, because of the
Department's insistence that the Bureau provide a rapid determin-
ation as to whether any given person subject to prosecution was
‘overheard, present, or referred to in the course of a conversation
‘covered by electronic devices. Based on available information at

“ that time from the Department that there would be selective cases
-to be reviewed, it was determined to be most logical that two
separate indices be established, one to cover criminal matters and
the other security matters. Subsequently, the Solicitor Generai
publicly disclosed that an extensive review would be made on past
and pending cases to determine if evidence had been used from
electronic devices and the Department requests that a11 names be
searched . rough both the criminal and security files. This ~
completely changed all aspects of the operation of these indices
and the amount of work involved, particularly when the Department
began submitting not--only names of persons subject to prosecution
but names of attorneys involyew and associates, af—the-sabjects.

CURRENT STATUS:

     

There are approximately 60,000 cards ‘of the special
indices in the Special Investigative Divisién and approximately

RE: SPECIAL INDICES OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES

200,000 cards of the special indices in the Domestic Intelligence
Division. Furthermore, because of the telephone surveillances
eurrently in operation in the security field, approximately 300
new cards are being received weekly in the Domestic Intelligence
Division, : i q

Since the special indices were established in
October, 1966, the Department has submitted approximately 1,000
names for searching. Each name is searched through both of these
special indices. There is attached a sample of the form being
used requesting searches and a copy of three cards from the

“The Department has indicated that in the immediate
future it contemplates asking the Bureau to check as many as
25,000 names through the special indices. Without a doubt, ail
future cases involving prosecution will require search of these

nas ees.

mace

The position adopted by the Department in these matters
makes it- impossible for us to maintain these indices separately

names of persons to be checked in connection with a particular
efiminal or security prosecution. But as matters now stand,

of effort in checking the same names through each aS we now must
do to comply with the Department's requests. Both Divisions are
in agreement on this point.

. Consolidation of the indices into one raises the
question of where if should be maintained. We believe the
consolidated indices should be maintained by the Files and
Communications Division. There is ne reason for it to. be main-
tained either by the Domestic Intelligence Division or the Special
Investigative Division. .

The maintenance of this indices and the search functions
involved fall logically within the normal operations and
responsibilities of the Files and Communications Division and
ean be carried out in the most efficient manner by that. Division.

uBJECT: DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REQUESTS
FOR ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE
CHECKS (62-318)

As you are aware, Department is submitting by letter to

Bureau names of individuals presently being prosecuted or being
considered for prosecution in all types of cases with request they

* be advised if any of these individuals have been involved in any
electronic surveillances, Indications are that there will be
thousands of such requests received. These names are checked
through special indices maintained in Special Investigative Division
(SID) and Domestic Intelligence Division (DID), and Department is
‘advised by letter of results. SID is co-ordinating program, but ~e
some correspondence will be prepared by DID and General Investigative?” .
Division if substantive cases supervised by them involved, If any =~
record is located, Field Office where surveillance occurred is |
requested to furnish pertinent logs which are subsequently trans-
mitted to Department.

 

 

. With representatives of SID, where majority of correspond- :
ence will be handled, we have worked out mechanics of processing
and filing record material. Purpose of this memorandum is to set
forth these details. .

A control file has been opened entitled, "Department of

will also be placed in control file. Supervisors preparing corre-
spondence should prepare extra copy specifically designed for
control file when correspondence relates to substantive case.

  
 
  
  
   
  
   

As set forth above, if subject of communication is subject
‘of a Bureau investigation communication will be filed in case file
with copy in control file, and no indexing will be necessary, -~TF
subject of communication is not subject of Bureau case, but voice was
recorded incidental to electronic-surveillance in one of our cases

:
i
and we are furnishing Department positive information, communication ¢ |

‘will be filed in control file and name of subiect will be indexed.

We will not index names of individuals on which no record is located
similar to procedure followed in handling Bureau's name check program.
Communications relating to these negative checks will be filed in

control file. i

In order to appropriately cover necessary files, uniformity
of caption of communications is most desirable. On outgoing commu-

should be in caption to facilitate classifying material, If Bureau
case is involved, subject of case should also be part of caption
with sufficient copies to cover both'’case file and control file.

When Bureau has record on name check, Field is requested
to send in logs and copies are hand-delivered to Department.
Departmental official receiving logs is required to sign receipt
which should be attached to'related outgoing yellow for filing
purposes by Supervisor preparing outgoing communication. Supervisor
should prepare sufficient copies of receipt appropriately designated
for substantive files in which electronic surveillances were conducted.
