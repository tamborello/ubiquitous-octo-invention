_ SUBJECT: June Cobb

I spoke witl al the Privacy Act request of June Cobb. He agreed that in general HRG-need not provide documents to

Tequestors that are released pursuant to JFK and publicly available in the National Archives. Your response to Ms. Cobb could be to
merely state that the documents she seeks are publicly available at the Archives and give her the address and phone number.

One exception: If you can do a search on your JFK index far documents indexed under her name and retrieve eocuments that have NOT
yet been released at the Archives, then you will have to pull those documents only, review them, and release them td!

ee a
I think this approach makes a lot of sense and HRG should be able to respond in this manner for Privacy/EOIA requests (otherwise, why
have an Archives???). Bob and { agree that on initial requests this is what we should do, and there is case law that would support us in
this response; if the courts ulitimately tell us we are wrong in subsequent litigation, then we will have to reevaluate this position, but
until that time comes, there is no legal reason not to respond this way.
