MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Jee Harvey OSWALD

At 1010 hours on 3 December, Mr. Papich of the FBI advised that the
Bureau had received a cable last night from the Legal Attache in
Mexico City who is in touch with our representative there. He stated

that our representative had been informed by Captain Wheelock of the
Nicaraguan Intelligence Service that ALVARADO told him, Wheelock, that

he recanted his original story because of fear of physical harm; that
Alvarado was being deported from Mexico to Nicaragua on 4 December 1963
and would be accompanied by Wheelock; that Wheelock assured our repre-
sentative that Alvarado would be available for further interview in
Nicaragua if the United States desired.

Mr. Papich statéd that the Bureau would like to have him subjected
to a polygraph examination by this Agency and would appreciate receiving
word as soon as possible as to whether we will handle the matter since
4f we will not handle it the FBI will have to determine what other steps
might be taken to see that this is done. I advised Mr. Papich that I
would check into the matter, that I did not know whether we had available
at this time a polygraph operator who could properly handle this matter
but in any event I would let him kmow whether this-can be done.
