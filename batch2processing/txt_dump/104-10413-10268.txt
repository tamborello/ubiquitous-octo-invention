Headquarters will note from the above that three lines were disconnected in
order to cover three Yugoslav lines. Two of the lines which were disconnected
were Cuban Embassy lines, both were not in use by the Cubans, One was in
the apartment which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobas and not occupied by
other Cubans, The other was a telephone in the Cuban Embassy which was
never answered, The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas' line moved to the
Embassy. They have also asked for the telephone company to repair 14-92-14,
As soon as these lines are working again, coverage of two of the Yugoslav
Embassy lines will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which

are presumed to have a much higher priority.
