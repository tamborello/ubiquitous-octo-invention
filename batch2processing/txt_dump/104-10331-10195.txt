Oswald's "Original A” Fite and Request for Search for Attachments

HRP has completed its review of Oswald's original A (DCD) file; except for a couple of 1978 HSCA memos, it is duplicated in
the sequestered collection (microfilm). The file is ° releasable in full” and will be ready for transfer to NARA by the end of week.

in herreview of the file, ARRB staffer Michelle Combs noticed that two attachments to a key document were not in the file:
1) 00-B 3,232,789 and
2) 28 June 1962 memo re contact with the source of the OOB,

She requested that copies ‘of the documents be ailded to the file if not already in the sequestered collection. Our search of the original
file, the microfilmed copy-in the sequestered collection and the JFK database failed to locate the two documents. If unable te find the
documents, please provide explanation for incorporation into the file. 1 have provided Eileen a copy of the document which cites

the attachments.
