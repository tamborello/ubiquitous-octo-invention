requests that they be specified with an accompanying
explanation of when and under what circumstances they were
destroyed. If no information regarding their destruction
is available, piease specify the earliest time, and under
what circumstances, CIA first became aware the items were
missing.

We expect that staff representatives of the Committee
and of CIA will expedite compliance with these requests,
and indicate priorities for production through preliminary
review of this notification and discussion of the files
involved. It would also be helpful if CIA identifies those
persons within each Directorate and Division or Office who
are actually in charge of reviewing and assembling material,
so that Committee staff can also discuss these requests with’
them and resolve rapidly any questions or difficulties
which might arise.

We also expect that a good deal of this material will
be readily available in view of the reviews already done
by CIA in this area over the past two years. As soon as
some portions of any requests are available for review, the

Committee staff should be notified in order that they may

‘begin their inspection while the remainder.is being assembled.

Finally, it. should be noted that this document re-

quest does not supersede any earlier requests for material

 

in this area which are still outstanding. If CIA staff
encounters overlap in responding to this and earlier re-

quests, the Committee staff should be promptly notified.

and all other files or unfiled documentary materials in
the office, or storage repositories, of the organizational
unit which managed the program or project in question.

The requests also include all such files in the

offices or storage repositories of the responsible Division
Director, Office Director, and Directorate Deputy Director,
in the DCI office, and in any other part of the Agency which

had significant involvement or connection with the program.

Where the Committee requests "documents" or "docu-
mentary materials", those terms are defined as all corres-
pondence, memoranda, notes, working papers, buck slips and
routing slips, studies, reports, charts, films, tapes, and
all other writings, printings, typings, or drafts, and
copies or reproductions.

When files for a specific project or program are re~-
quested under the best known designation of that project
or program, the request includes files of any earlier or
later versions of that project. Thus, the request for
Project MHCHAOS would also comprehend files for the ante-
cedent MHALPHA and MHPASHA projects and for the subsequent
MEVAPOR. .

When any files, portions thereof, or particular docu-

mentary materials are no longer available, the Committee

Mr. William E. Colby

Director of Central Intelligence
Central Intelligence Agency
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Colby:

On May 27 and June 2, the Senate Select Committee informed
the Central Intelligence Agency of the Committee's plans
for examining the field of foreign intelligence and the
subject of covert action. In the area of the domestic
activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Select
Committee intends to address a wide range of issues,
including the domestic aspects of CIA's foreign operations.
The Committee intends to approach the issues of the CIA's
domestic activities with a broad perspective, realizing,
as I am sure you agree, that the threats to United States
security and the need to protect sources and methods of
intelligence, as well as CIA installations and personnel,
eross our national borders.

Basically, the subdjectsof investigation fall into the
following five headings:

1. Counterintelligence activities at home and those
counterintelligence activities abroad which involve
American @itizens, including activities undertaken
pursuant to the Director s authority to protect intel-
ligence sources and methods.

2. Foreign intelligence activities at home and those foreign
intelligence activities abroad which involved American
citizens.

3. The domestic operations of the CIA undertaken in sup-
port of activities abroad.

4, Relationships between other organizations, public and
private, and the CIA.

5. The use of CIA personnel, funds, or facilities for pur-
poses unrelated to its intelligence missions.

Within these broad subjects of investigation, the Committee
will examine "questionable activities" by the CIA. These
activities are those where there exist, in the words of the
agreed upon Outline for Inquiry Procedures, "specific alle-
gations of Agency or Executive Branch abuses or other con-
troversial specific matters where there is reason to believe
improprieties may have occurred". The following categories
are believed by the Committee to be among those in which
questionable activities have taken place: mail openings;
electronic surveillance; equipment testing within the United
States; surreptitious entries; penetration of dissident
groups; use of cover and false documentation; security inves-
tigations, including those initiated as a result of or in
connection with news leaks; use of polygraphs; political
misuse of the CIA; assistance provided CIA by other agencies
or private companies and CIA's assistance to them; CIA
management of its investments; CIA use of proprietaries,
notional organizations and devised facilities; CIA experi-
ments with drugs on unwitting U. S. citizens; CIA detention
of individuals within the United States.

In regard to each questionable activity chosen for study,

the Select Committee will examine the nature of the activity
and will attempt to evaluate the results. The Committee
will also look at the CIA's authority to undertake the
activity, the relationship between the activity and the CIA's
missions, the internal mechanisms for initiation and review,
and the external-mechanisms for control of such activities.

Though the initial focus will be on the specific question-
able activity, the Select Committee's inquiry is designed
to reach fundamental issues which bear directly on the ade-
quacy of the administrative organization and procedures of
the CIA, and the legislation presently controlling the
Agency. Among the major issues which the Committee will
address are: . :

1. What is the legal authority for CIA intelligence and
counterintelligence activities within the United
States? What is the legal authority for CIA actions
directed at U. S. citizens abroad? Should the authority
be clarified or revised?

2. What limitations are placed on CIA intelligence and
counterintelligence activities within the United States
by the Constitution and laws of the United States?

What limitations are placed on CIA intelligence and
counterintelligence activities directed at U. 8. citi-
zens abroad by the Constitutions and laws of the United
States? Should the limitations be clarified or revised?

3. What have been the purposes and aims of CIA intelligence
and counterintelligence activities within the United
States or directed at U. S. citizens abroad? How were
these objectives set? Were they appropriate? Should
they be modified? :

4. What is the origin and purpose of the charge to the
Director, Central Intelligence, to protect intelligence
sources and methods? What actions have been taken pur-
suant to it? Were those actions appropriate? Should
the charge be clarified or revised? Should the DCI be
provided with additional authority in order to carry
out the charge?

5. What is the origin and purpose of the prohibition on
CIA in respect to police and law enforcement powers,
and internal security functions? Has this prohibition
interferred with the DCI's charge to protect intelli-
gence sources and methods? To what extent has this
prohibition interferred with other duties and missions
of the CIA? Should the prohibition be clarified or
revised?
