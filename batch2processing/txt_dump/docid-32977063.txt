Mr. Wilson noted that a press staternent had not been issued
since none of the families in the Miami area had been reported as
planning te return to Cuba. Mr. Johnson said that State had not
made the decision, as reported. Mr. Kennedy commented that the
decision was made ina strange way, since he had agreed to 1&NS
permitting re-entry upon State's representation to him that the
action was ready to go, except for that permission.

General Lansdale alerted the Group, for the particular atten-
tion of the FBI and CIA, that the situation among refugees in south-
ern Florida waa explosive, that undetected Communist agents
among the refugees there could turn emotional dernonstrations
into riots very darnaging to the U.S.

On "food for prisoners," the Group decided that State would
_ explore promptly the possibility of a 3rd country ambassador
approaching Castro privately on behalf of private relief agencies,
the legality of using PL 480 surplus foods for this purpose, and
the private relief organizations which would undertake auch a
- delivery.
