ing {GARRETT jare negative. WFO will cond a discreet prelimi-
nary” investigation to ascertain his background and thereafter
make further recommendation concerning investigation of this

a suburb-of Washington, D. C.), and anti WFo ind is listed

The subscriber to unlisted phone Number (WH 6-5972Q(u)

is currently being ascertained.

Concerning STERLING, CARLOS MARQUEZ, 4600 Connecticut

Avenué, Apartment 705, this individual is the subject: of

the case captioned "CARLOS MARQUEZ STERLING, IS — Cuba;

RA - Cuba," Bureau file 109-321, New York file 105-61131,

and Miami file 105-2476. New York is office of origin con-
cerning him and his background and activities are well known
to WFO, New York and Miami so that further investigation con-
cerning him is not recommended. It should also be noted that
at one time WFO utilized STERLING as a source of information
under WFO file 134-3192, Bureau file 109-321; but when he
moved to New York City during the Summer of 1963, his services
as a source of information could no longer be used by WFO.

Concerning DICK PIERROT, 2701 31st Street, N. W.,
this individual appears to be identical: to the case captioned
"ALBERT OGDEN PIERROT, aka ALBERT O, PIERRO, A. OGDEN PIERROT,
'DICK,' PSI — Cuba," Bureau file 100-133192, WFO file 134-3398,

-In 3960 PIERROT's, services were utilized briefly by WFO as

a Ly 4@ance - one time he sold airplanes to the Cuban
Government shortly after CASTRO assumed the position of .
Premier. His background is well known to WFO and it does not
appear that a additional investigation concerning him is
warranted. ( U) - :
