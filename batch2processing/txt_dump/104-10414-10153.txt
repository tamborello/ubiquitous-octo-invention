Subject: W.L.OLTMANS: (10 June 1925)

On 29 Deéember 1971. OLTMANG invited the Cultural Attache of the
Russian Embassy KUZNETSOV for an evening in his house. The invit- ;
ation was also for some other members of the Russian Representation.
At the same time OLTMANS was’ to invite some six important journalist
KUZNETSOV, should ask OPALEV and IZWEKOV to come along with him.

The, date agreed’on originally was 11 January 1972. It then was
changed twice. When 14 January also wasn't suitable, it was agreed
on 7 January to make the date for 18 January 1972 at 20,00 hrs.

From the invitation it could only be infered that OLTMANS wanted

to offer his guests an opportunity for an _ informal discussion.

" About the packground. of the ‘present “good relations of ‘OLTMANS with

the Soviet Representation : in The Netherlands, section B is) able to
report the following:
(This information comes from vulnerable source ~ OPPERBAAS. )

—T, In September 1970 OLTMANS says with some surprise that he sudden-

ly received an invitation to a party at the Russian Embassy.
He thinks it crazy; he doesn't belong to that club at all. But
his thinking is along the lines of those people.

‘2. In October 1970 OLTNANS appears to be interested in an interview

with KOSYGIN's son-in-law GVISHIANI who allegedly was connected

with American-Russian™ discussions about forming a mutual "think~

ing factory".

Presumably this had some connection with the so called Club of

Rome in which GVISHIANI plays a role.

Remark: GVISHIANI is chairman of. the state committee for science
and technology and is suspected to be a highly placed
Intelligence Officer.

3. Begining March 1970 OLTMANS contacted the Press Attache OPALEV
from the Russian Embassy; OLTMANS would still like to have an
interview with GVISHIANI,

It would be a filmed interview in which OLTNANS would cooperate
with the NOS. (TV).

In this period OPALEV's cooperation does not yet seem very
extensive.

4, Thanks to the cooperation of Aurelio PECCEI, chairman of the
Club of Rome, OLTMANS at the end of April 1971 succeeded in get-
ting in contact with GVISHIANI in Paris.

Also present at this discussion was the former .menber of the Russ
Embassy FEDIEROVSKY, now chief of protocol of the state committee
for science and technology.

At this opportunity GVISHIANI immediately invited OLTMANS for a
visit to Moscow.

.FEDEROVSKY was instructed to inform the Russian Embassy | in The

gue about it.

“GVISHIANI who at the same time is chairman of the commission for

environment administration in the Soviet Union, asked OLTMANS to
make a film at the same time about the environment administration
in. the Soviet Union to. support the international environment

: conference ‘to be held this year.

Begining. May it becomes clear that since OLTMANS' discussion with
GVISHTANIT, OPALEV's attitude towards OLTMANS has greatly changed,
OPALEV is now all willingness.

-. In May OLTMANS makes his film with GVISHIANI- and receives an inv-

10.2.

‘itatiom.to come to the Soviet Union for the second half of August

and the whole of September, where he could film ten scientific
institutes, - .

Vienna, where there was a meeting of the Club of Rome.

* Begining October 1971 OLTMANS again saw GVISHIANI in Paris, where,

among other things he spoke to him about his visit to The Netherla

- in the second week of October,

OLTMANS did his begt to oblige GVISHIANI while visiting The Neth-
erlands by trying to establish business relations for him (for
instance with Philips).
(

wwee
In ‘November 1971 ovguans* from the Russian state television an
offer for a five year contract to make exclusive films in the
Soviet Union.*

This offer was made to OLTMANS during his visit to the Soviet

Union. It is coneretization of the earlier offer by GVISHIANI to
film a number of scientific institutes in the Soviet Union.

On’ 17 November OLTMANS allegedly discussed this business further
with GVISHIANI in Geneva.

On 23 January 1972 OLTMANS will make another visit to Moscow to
discuss making the above mentioned films without the participation
of the NOS, At this opportunity OLTMANS will leave behind a memo
about LUNS in connection with OLTMANS' present agitation against
the Secretary-General of NATO.

OLTMANS wants to prevent LUNS getting any future opportunity to
visit Moscow.

Referring to the “meeting in OLTHMANS' house on 18 January 1972 it
can be reported that on 17 January 1972 OLTMANS stated that he

is again seeking reaction from the Russians who will visit him on
18 January; their reaction in connection with OLTMANS' request

to the general prosecutor of the High Council to bring action
against LUNS.

3.

In the. morning on 18 January OLTMANS also stated that KUZNETSOV
said that. OLTMANS' action against LUNS will not. “succeed because
the "bosses" stand behind LUNS. .

It is not clear when KUZNETSOV said this’ ‘to ‘OLTMANS, but it is

- known’ that OLTMANS recently attended - a meeting awhere a number

11.

of Russians were present...
(Possibly the meeting of the Association "Nederland-USSR" “with
the delegation. from ‘“USSR-Nederiand" - on 4 January. 1972.)

On 19 January 1972 it was . reported that HOFLAND (one of the guest
invited to the evening in OLTMANS!' house) called before his
arrival and asked whether he could bring a friend. :
Afterwards this friend appeared to be Peter ZONNEVELD from De

- Telegraaf.
_OLTMANS said that ‘at the press conference which he (OLTMANS)
‘will give.on 20 January 1972 several guests, Milo ANSTADT, Rob ..

KOPULT ‘and Jaap JANSEN will defend OLTMANS against the attack on
