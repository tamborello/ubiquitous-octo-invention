SUBJECT: Release of Information on Mexico City Teltaps

1. Protection of sources and methods and liaison equities
require that references to the Mexico City Station teltap
activity be excised from any documents released under the
auspices of the JFK Assassination Record Collection Act of 1992.
While the teltap activity mentioned in the documents under review
occurred some thirty plus years ago, the joint teltap operation
with Mexican liaison has never been terminated; it continues to
this day in a slightly different form.

2. Release of any information that would constitute
official USG acknowledgment of the existence of the joint teltap
operation would have a serious adverse impact on current
operations. Relations between the Station and the liaison
service would be affected, with the likely outcome of
discouraging liaison from cooperating in similar ventures in the
future with Mexico City Station. Official acknowledgment of the
existence of the joint teltap in the 1960's would embarrass the
liaison service given Mexico's strong brand of nationalism and
sensitivity towards the issue of sovereignty vis a vis the United
States. The service probably would terminate its cooperation
with the Station on the current joint teltap operation in order
to be. able to defend itself against domestic critics.
