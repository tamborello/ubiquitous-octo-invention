Re: ATON CONSTANZO PALAU
GERALD PATRICK HEMMING, etal.

NOTE: {Sune 9, 1965, CIA furnished data indicating subjects were forming |

a commando force in Miami to be used by Dominican General Antonio
Imbert, They were reportedly recrypit Cuban refugees and American
adventurers to make up this forced re conducting investigation in
this regard, It appears that possibly the approach made by Belt
amirez may have been_in connection with t he same allegation and
Since his son is a PSI e may be in a position to furnish rthwhile
nformation thereby saving investigative time and effort. x
