e, j One is whether the provision of the consolidated bond form giving a first

. named insured power to act for all the organizatioris covered by the bond

- 4s acceptable under our interpretation of the bonding provisions. The
_ second is whether a master bonding program in which certain of the lecal ~~

organizations are covered only on schedule A of the consolidated bond
form is not in effect allanket bond as regards those locals. The third
is whether the placement of collateral with surety by the insured would
not in effect amount to a deduction of a percentage of any loss so as to
violate the requirement that there is no mininuz limitation on the amount
- for which a person must be covered by bonding. = = , :

: SUBJECT: Teamsters Bonding,

"Qa dune 21, 1961, Frank Byhivight, President and James B /oarch, Seoretary-
2 Treasurer, of the United Bonding Insurance Company of 836 East 38th Street,
.' Indianapolis, Indiana, were referred to this office by Sidney Cox of the
' Treasury Department, and conferred with Mr. Blum of this office with
regard to bonding problems in coanection with their ‘prospective contracting
ag primary surety for the International Brotherhocd of Teausters.

During the course of ths conference, the informants revealed that United
Bonding Insurance hed been coatasted by one BE. B. Cefroy with referonce

- to taking over as primary suroty for tha Temsters’ master pending pregrame
The previcus primary surety was the United Benefit Insurance Company of
Chicago, Tlinois of which Mr. Cefrey was formerly vice-president. so
According to informants, Hr. Cefrey indicated that he was now seating for

‘. Charles Bray of the Homer Bray Service Company of Chicago, Illineis.

.'. °.?.". Under the arrangement proposed to the United Bonding Insurance Company,

co" 40 per cent of the premiums received by the United Bonding Insurance

_ is.” Gempany would be paid the Homer Bray Service Company as a brokerage fee

- and 25 per cent would bo paid to the Hamer Bray Service Company as agent
for the United Benefit Insurance Coupany. :

 

 

. Additionally, it was revealed that Lloyds of London had been asting as
:. @ reinsurer under the previous bonding arrangement and it was contemplated .
that Lloyds of London would act as a roinsurer for losses between $100, 000 - -
_ and $400,000 in the proposed arrangezent. It was also alleged that Central .
Casualty Company which was apparently a co-insurer under the provicus
arrangement was wholly owned by Hozer Bray.

 

 

Fron the information revealed there was no reason to believe that United
Bonding Insurance Company would not be an acceptable sursty under section oy
502 of the Act. Messrs. Wright and Burch seemed particularly anxious to oof
make sure that they would not be violating any laws in undertaking this : ;
arrangement. They indicated a desire to deal directly with the Tesnsters {
Union rather than tet through Hener Bray as intermediary. Aspects of the i
law of the bending provisions as they relate to surety ccupanics wero ve
explained and literature was provided to Mosers. Wright and Burch. Three “
of the questions they asked are being given consideration and two of then
_ are already under study in connection with other organizations.

to handle the business and asked Wright if he ‘would participate for
; 25 percent, At that time, Cefrey quoted a rate of $6.25 per thousand
-. per annum to be charged for the bonds. Wright agreed to participate. .

-.. Wright said that by letter dated Decernber 29, 1959, signed by ;
 'B. KJ Pyle of the United Benefit Company, their check #22686 in |
~ the amount of $9,750 was forwarded to Wright as his portion of
“a premium deposit of $100, 000 which had been made by the Teamsters “
-. Union less 2-1/2 percent premium tax. Wright said that he was -
- , surprized when he got the check representing 10 percent interest, '
-' inasmuch as he had agreed to participate for 25 percent. He cons,

which would be to insure losses over owels n dollars with somes... |
one like Lloyds of London. He said that this would leave approxi- a

from Tri-State Insurance Company to United Benefit, signed by ;
D. B. Ehmes of Tri-State, setting forth conditions under which : i

“WA 601588. Do

Wright said that he was originally approached ia approximately ae 7
' October 1959 by a man named Menerovski who was with the Lake- : oe
State Auto Association in Chicago, Illinois. Menerovski claimed —=
that he had the Teamster bonding business sewed up and asked

. Wright if he would write the business for him. Wright said that

* he told Menerovski that he was not going to do anything until the :
"i wates and forms were more clearly established by the American
-» Surety Association. : . . a

Wright said that he next received a cali from his own agent in an ° : |

.| Newark, a man named Matty Silverman,’ who had been approached “|

". by an unknown party who also stated that he had the Teamster

reply. : .

Wright said that some time in December 1959 he was contacted ©
- by a man named Don Pletts, who represented an agency in j
Miami, Florida, who also told him that he had the Teamster . ; i
. - bonding business and offered to post a cash collateral of $306, ooo.

'” Pletts had previously contacted Jim Halpern of the United Public '
' Insurance Company of Indianapolis for the same purpose. Wright ;
said that a man named John Quinlan with the Peerless Insurance 4
. Company even quit his job to go with Pletts because Fletts scemed
so certain of getting the Teamster. business. non
