T-1, a confidential source abroad, advised that
Lane arrived in Bublin, Ireland, on March 6, 1967, then
visited London and on March 10, 1967, proceeded to Cepen-
hagen from London Airport. Lane has since returned to the
United States and is reliably reported to have spent a
number of days at the end of March with Jim Garrison,
District Attorney in New Orleans, Louisiane. (s)

The game reliable source réported that Garrison
considers that the American authorities will do everything
possible to prevent his bringing the killers of the late
President Kennedy to justice, that powerful forces were
responsible for the assassination, and that anti-Castro
Cubans played a part in it. (9)
