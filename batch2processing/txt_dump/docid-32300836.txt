Beverly Hills, California, for the statement period from
7/ib/on, to 8/10/64, reflects he obtained $1500 in cash
from his account on 8/5/64, but the other disbursements were

'for purposes which are of no special pertinence to this
investigation. He deposited two checks to his account,
totaling slightly over $2500. Efforts are being made to
obtain photos of the two checks from the Fidelity Bank.

. “On 8/14/64, HENRY KOLB, Operations Officer, Bank

of America, La Cienega-Sunset Branch, Los Angeles, advised
that in July, 1964, the Internal Revenue Service attached .

the account Selena Enterprises, Inc., but a short time later
released the account from the attachment. IRS will be
contacted to learn the reason for the attachment. It is
recalled that ROSSELLI has been interested in, this company,
which is a talent agency, and has loaned money to the company.

‘time MASON indicated that he and EDWIN ULEY wealthy “@ 4 21F

oilman, owned Riverside Raceway an OSSELLI,” ITEDMAN and” ee"
LEFF indicated an interest in buying it and, therefore,
‘MASON met with them in Las Vegas. “MASON said that these

ROY_G@ILEWIS, wid owns about one-third of the
Raceway, advised SA SFORGE E, BLAND that about four years
ago he bought Riverside Raceway from JOHN EDGAR, a wealthy
Chicago industrialist and MASON was apparently representing
EDGAR and also received a "finders fee" from LEWIS for -
persuading EDGAR to sell at what was a relatively low price.
LEWIS advised that after he made the purchase, he was
persuaded by NORMAN CHANDLER, owner of the Los Angeles Times,
to sell two-thirds of his interest to EDWIN PAULEY and ED...
LEVY, the latter being a wealthy importer of automobiles.
