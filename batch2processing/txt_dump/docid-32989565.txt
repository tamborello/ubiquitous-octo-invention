Dear Mr. Adams::

As a retired F.B.1T.. agen’ (1944-1970) ands @ U.S. ct tizen, I
deplore the senseless overly critieal,-repétitiously debasing and
dangerous allegations and recrininations currently being waged by
certain self-seeking U.S. Congressmen, media people and others agains
oun U.S.. intelligence Agencies, particularly the F.B.I. and CTA..

Nevertheless the net harvest of this frenzied distortion adverse
affects even our state and local intelligence activities.

It has finally hit close to home. I am enclosing for your
information a copy of a clipping from the Asheville Citizen, Ashevilll
N.S., issue of January 16, 1976, captioned: "Sen. Morgan Calls F.B.T
‘Most _ Dangerous Threat.'" Also enclosed is a copy. of che editorial

 

 

io have reason to believe that the venomous remarks ee Eipubed.
to Senator Morgan, in the enclosed clipping are correctly, Re ivaaey:
being that Nsheville TV Station WLOS-fV carried, the same: ren
