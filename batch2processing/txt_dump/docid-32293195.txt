pcr [-__________]} on. December 16, 1962, advised
that it was believed that. FRANK SINATRA would.come to New
Orleans with DEAN MARTIN early. in- December, 1962, when MARTIN -
was filming a portion of a motion picture, and MARCELLO
wanted to contact. FRANK. SINATRA. advised that
SINATRA did not.come to New Orleans, and as far as he knew
there was no contact between MARCELLO and SINATRA.

. The Los Angeles Office, by airtels dated November 20,
21, and 26, 1962,. in the BILSOL, NBA investigation, reported _
information involving HOMER and MAXINE SNOWDEN,..5206 Brookview
Drive, Dallas, Texas, who are possible connections with BILLIE
SOL ESTES. Among SNOWDEN's activities was his association with
WILLIAM RUSSELL PRUNER, Apartment 103, 2509 Turtle Creek,
Dallas, Texas, President of Texas-Mustang Industries, Inc.,
2528 Farrington, Dallas, Texas. .

An individual named EDWARD NICHOLAS BECKER, 8613
West Olympic, Los. Angeles, a licensed private investigator
in the State of California, was introduced by. SNOWDEN to

‘PRUNER.on September 21, 1962. Also present was CARLO ROPPOLO,
age 27, a graduate geologist of Louisiana State University,
residence 515 Egan Street, Shreveport, Louisiana, The meeting
was to promote an oi] additive known as Mistang, and-ROPPOLO
expressed an interest in being the Louisiana distributor.

- ROPPOLO claims he. wanted to contact.a wealthy and influential
uncle in New Orleans, and BECKER and ROPPOLO were supposed to.
have gone to New Orleans to get this individual, who was
subsequently identified as CARLOS MARCELLO. ROPPOLO alleged
several days later that his mother is CARLOS MARCELLO's sister.
The significance of the activities of SNOWDEN, PRUNER, and
BECKER, insofar as.the relationship with MARCELLO, is unknown.
SNOWDEN is apparently an oil promoter who has numerous
promotional interests and has apparently served in both the
California State Penitentiary and the Federal. Correctional
Institution at Terminal Island. In view of the possibility.
that this information is part of the intrigue involving
private investigators connected with the BILSOL.case, the
information is not being included in the body of the report;
however, efforts will be made to determine any possible
connections between MARCELLO and CARLO ROPPOLO.
