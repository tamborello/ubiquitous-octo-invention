‘Nick,

Well after 13 1/2 years I finally found out your whereabouts, Dam, its
been a long time since Kirknewton, Scotland, and the beer we drank on the
beach and the club. Had to get your address from the outfit in Texas.

- Nick, whatever happened to Sgt Prater? If you know his whereabouts please
send me his address. How in the hell have you been doing?

Nick, I had a nervous breakdown. Plus in 74 my leg shattered in over a
hundred places. Things have really gone to hell for me. I'm working with
the vets benefits counseler, who is a ex 203. Speaking of 203's where the hell
is Frenchy? You know the little guy. What I'm going to say is no longer
classified, so don't get all shit shook. I've done checked it out.

Christ, you remember the position I worked at, in Sgt Praters section, don't
you? You remember about a month or 6 weeks before I left Scotland, when I picked
up a link mentioning the assassination of President Kennedy. How hard I tried
to get it sent out, and because of that fuckin Forney'and Delaughter they wouldn't
send it to NSA. Since I have learned that the man’s name, most mentioned was
number 4 in a certain branch of organized crime at phe time. Was number 2 last
year. I will send you a form for proof of claim. This guy here "the 203" says
I should be getting a service connected disability for my nerves. The “link was"
Lisbon to Tangiers you remember. How I got my ass chewed for not dropping the
link. Have learned that this branch of crime often will put out a feeler of
forthcoming things. By sending it as a practice message.

Nick it really broke me up after Nov. 22, 63. Especially when I had it all

‘ before hand. It was first like the 202's said, Ha. JI was nuts when the Russians

first came out with the ITI & B's. Later proved them wrong didn't 1. That was
another first for us as I recall. Duane Bruntz from Baker trick put up a good
support of my claim. I'm sending you this certified so to make sure you get it.

* As I recall you should be able to B.S. them good enough to help me... I know it

cost me a divorce and every thing from my wife. Christ, you remember Marlene,
don't you? That good looking little 1/2 Indian girl from N. Dak. Nick when
you get this form send it back to me and I'll let the vets benefits guy to send -
it in. Being a M.Sgt I think you know how to bull shit pretty good. Also do
you know Sgt Harley and Sgt Willy Hendrickson's address. I guess old Garnett, K.
Tatum retired. Wonder what gehto, he is living in, Ha! .
