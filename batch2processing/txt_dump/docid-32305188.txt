The only support in PB files for the $50,000

loan to VOI was a VOI finamcial statement dated
January 31, 1961, which showed a deficit of $37,300,
a net.worth of $15,700, : an operating loss for the
month of January, 1961, of: $4 900, YOI tax returns for
1958 to 1961 showed repeate losses and insolvency.)

AS shown by the foregoing, PB through ite
President, JOSEPH fF, VERHELLE, advanced $59,000
of PB funds in the neme of VOI, am insolvent firm
devoid of earnings. These funds were diverted by
PB and used for the. benetit of two other firms,
ANC and NCS, also insolvest and devoid of earnings
at the time. This advance would therefore appear ;
to be @ misapplication of PB funds im violation of
Title 18, United States Code, Section 656.. Furthermore,
the deceptions employed by PB management in the
negotiation of the above YOI loan and the diversion
and use of the proceeds thereof would appear to be a
violation of Titles 18, United States Code, Section 1005.

‘and loss statement also, was the ome which had been presented ;
to the Central States Pension. Fund for the purpose of obtaining : ;
‘a loam. NAIMAN and TRISCARO told GROSBERG that NAIMAN had not ~ :
been successful in getting a loan from the Central States Pension. oo
| - Fund. because the fund! was not permitted to ‘end.to a foreign . |
I corporation, . GROSEBERG concluded from the financial. statement. :
that the firm was a “going” concern, but was not “too. profitable".
After looking at the statement’ and while NAIMAN and TRISCARO co |
were in his room, GROSBERG made a long distance, person-to-person
call to ROBERT E, MC CARTHY at the Public Bank, Detroit. — |
.  GROSBERG told MC CARTHY that NATMAN was going to contact MC CARTHY
. regarding a loan, and that GROSBERG was callimg MC CARTHY —
through HOFFA’s request. NAIMAN subsequently went to Public
- Bank,. but GROSBERG did not know if TRISCARO went to the bank.
- GROSBERG was later told by MC CARTHY (and possibly by JOSEPH
:. VERHELLE, President of Public Bank) that the loan was.granted
' by Public Bank. ~

: . On more than one occasion while GROSBERG. was in the
International Office of the International Brotherhood of
Teansters ih: Washington, D.C,, VERBELLE and MC CARTHY called
HOFFA and discussed this loan amd others. It was GROSBERG’s
‘recollection that HOFPFA’s remarks im recommending that the above
mentioned loan be made by Public Bank for NAIMAN were to..the
effect that "If you could possibly grant the loan, I would.

like you to grant the loan.”

On August 14, 1962, FRENCH advised that .on March 16,
1962, WALTER J. SHERIDAN of the Department of Justice received
information that at the time of the abovesmentioned meeting in
-GROSBERG's hotel room, -GROSRERG already knew TRISCARO and was.
introduced to NAIMAN by TRISCARO. Following GROSRERG's
call to MC CARTHY at Public Bank, VERHELLE subsequently called
-GROSBERG, Wanting more information concerning the loan,
VERHELLE indicated to GROSBERG at the time that he did not
want to make the loan. After that, VERHELLE called GEORGE
FITZGERALD, an attorney for the Teamsters, and wanted ,
FITZGERALD to help him out of the situation but FITZGERALD
indicated. that he was unable todo so. According to FRENCH,
the above information concerning GROSBERG should be treated .
