, ‘ (b) FIORINT and Cowan @ conzatEz are long standing members of ©
' : the Secret Army Organisation of the International Anti- |
i Communist Brigade. The man ROLBERT seems to have acted as

. a recruiting agent fer FIORINI. °

(ce) Recruitment to the Organisation was carried out by

; . : newspaper advertisements in the Florida area and by
personal contacts. FIORINI seems to have'been the main
figure in this insofar as these particular men were
concerned. ; ; .

(4) Apart from FIORINT » GONZALEZ and possibly HOLBEQT, the
members of this particular group appear to be of fairly
low calibre, They xere probably attracted by the prospects
of money and adventure and some of them would probably have
been equally attracted te a purely srinins? venture,

 

(e) They had all been promised by FIORINI substantial payment
in return for their services but those interviewed claimed
that they had in fact been paid nothing up to date,

 

> ; (f) The aras they were carrying were in some cases the personal
property of members of the group who had carried them with !
them from Florida,

nS (g) Certain members of the party crossed the U.S./Mexican border a
ic carrying these firearms,

(h) All members of the party probably crossed the U.5./Mexican
border by road at Brownsville, Texas. .

PIORINI's claim to have fifteen million U.3. dollars in
Switzerland for aid to political prisoners is more likely
to be false than true. |

| (4) Phe Organisation clearly has some funds available to it, but

(3) It is reasonably clear that FIORINI and GORHAN @ GONZALEZ
intend to continue their anti-Castro activities,

' Five of these men including FIORINI were arrestéd on boatdiia yacht
. called the "amigo" in Belise Harbour.on 24th October, The “Amigo” is a .
privately owned boat from Progresso’ on, the northern Yucatan coast of Mexico «~° |
There was also on board a crew ofa captain and one other both of whom are
Mexican citizens who had been forced against their will to. take the boat
down the Yucatan and British Honduras coastline. The five men including
FIORINI all claimed to be U.S. citizens. . Following information provided
by the two crew members, another eight men. who also claimed to be U.S.
citizens were picked up on a small cay off the British Honduras coast .
together with a small quantity of arms and ammunition, All thirteen men : |
have been charged a8 being “prohibited immigrants" which the Police consider
ir to be the relevant charge under British Honduras law. ERAN Ie,
2. FIORINI was identified by a Special Branch officer from a\ photograph '
in a newspaper clipping found in his possession. He originally aye the . |
name FranKfBONELLI. He subsequently admitted that he was in fa TORINI. vias 4

3. Four of the thirteen were interviewed in’ Special Branch on
. 29th O¢tober and the following conclusions were reached as a result of
y, these interviews:-

years ago to Frank Anthony STURGIS following the. remarriage

of his mother. FIORINI gave the impression of being a
professional “con” wan who is prepared to tell whatever

story suits him. He was in charge of the party and may

have been the only one who knew precisely where they were

going. He claims ‘that after meeting two  other-boats east

of the isles of Turneffe it was their intention to join

the two boats dispensing with the "Amigo" and then proceeding

to Cuba. However, among the possessions of the five men on

beard the yacht was fourid a map of the Caribbean with three

\ , pencilled arrows pointing towards the northern coast of

Honduras. ‘the arrows had been drawn carelessly and did :
not indicate any particular places on the coasts :
