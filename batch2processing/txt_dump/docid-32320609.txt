4. To date, the FBI has processed documents with

on whether investigations of any establishment or
official of these countries can be released. See item

5. If the policy of not acknowledging our FCI

targets is changed for any country's establishment or
officials, all coverages on the establishment or
officials, as well as cases opened on persons who
contacted the establishment or officials will also be
declassified for foreign relations reasons. How
DOJ/DRC will handle these matters under Executive Order
12958 is uncertain since no case history has been
established yet. It appears, at present, that the DRC
will protect the technical coverages, lookouts and mail
covers by allowing classification under the "method"
exemption. The DRC has classified several
investigations using the foreign relations and method
exemptions. To date, no foreign relations exemption
has been declassified, but two on the former Soviet
Union are being referred to USDS. If the investigation
is declassified, any telephone calls received at the
establishment or by the officials would be
declassified; however, much of the information would
still be protected under FOIA guidelines. That would
not protect the fact of the technical coverage nor the

target. (&) (u)

6. If the investigation and technical, mail, banking,
or other coverage of one establishment is declassified,
it sets the precedent of an open acknowledgment that

there are countries we currently have disagreements or poor
relations with since the policy of our government is to improve
such relationships in the short term or long term and such
revelations would show a disrespect for the people of that
country; and the declassification for release of some documents,
even of significant historical interest, will be carefully
weighed by the FBI against the revelation of our investigative
techniques used against the establishments or officials of a
particular country. GQ u)

The FBI notes that since the Intelligence Community's
current policy is not to admit any technical or other coverages
or investigations of foreign officials or establishments, any
release of documents that confirms such coverages would therefore
be harmful both to United States foreign relations with that and
other countries and the FBI's FCI investigative capabilities,
including the revelation of sensitive sources and methods. AY)

The FBI is not aware of any country which acknowledges
the use of any technical or other coverages or investigations of
foreign officials or establishments in their own country or

elsewhere. Me)

OF SPECIAL NOTE:

In making a decision on whether declassification would
harm foreign relations with any country, the FBI requests careful
consideration of the effects on the FBI's FCI capabilities,
including our investigative sources and methods, or technical
coverages. The FBI contends that if USDS decides it would not
harm foreign relations with a particular country to officially
acknowledge that the FBI investigates its establishments or
officials, this will nevertheless result in the revelation of the
FBI's investigative sources and methods used, as well as have a
detremental effect on our capabilities to enter foreign
counterintelligence or law enforcement cooperative exchanges.

® U)

The FBI also requests USDS to consider the interests of
the (National Security Agency] and consult with them prior to
reaching a decision. KM) (¢
