implementation to member governments within the next
several weeks.

bd. Consulted our Ambassador in Mexico concerning the
possibility of institution by that country of adminis-
trative procedures to delay, or otherwise make. difficult,
the carrying of passengers to Cuba. The ‘Ambassador has
reported that essentially all feasible control measures,
short of discontinuing Cubana flights, are being taken

-by the Mexican government.

ce. Determined that Mexico is now requiring that visas
for Cuba be placed securely in passports of all travelers
departing for that country, and is stamping passports to
indicate that a person has departed or arrived from Cuba.

d. Determined that Mexico is prepared to furnish
manifests of all carriers departing for or arriving
from Cuba to Latin American countries which request them. -

e. Forwarded a memorandum to the President recom-
mending that ‘we seek action in the Council of the
Organization of American States to prohibit Latin American
ships from serving Cuba and to prohibit member countries
from granting overflight or landing rights to Soviet
aircraft.

f. Persuaded Mexico, through the good offices of
Senator Mansfield, to refuse~to permit Cubana Airlines
to employ Soviet-made Ilyushin 18 aircraft on the
Havana-Mexico route.

g. Pursued arrangements for 4 conference at Managua
on 3 April, to be attended by representatives of the
Isthmian states and the United States, for the purpose

Isthmian countries at the San Jose Conference in regard
to increasing the Caribbean surveillance effort with U.S.
training and material support, and stated U.S. willing-
ness to provide similar assistance to the countries
addressed. Replies from Trinidad and Venezuela have been

negative. Other countries have not yet responded.

2. The Department of Defense has:

a. Continued U.S. air and sea surveillance of the area
surrounding Cuba. ,

b. Continued the improvement of communications in »

Latin America by: (1) installation of a multi-channel

radio station in Costa Rica, (2) continuing work on a
similar facility in Nicaragua, (3) continuing negotia-
tions for installation of military radio facilities in

Honduras, Colombia and Ecuador, (4) commencing installa-

tion of a submarine cable between Fort Sherman, Canal
Zone, and Jamaica, to be completed about 1 April, -(5)
leasing six channels in this cable for communication
between the U.S, and the Canal Zone, and (6) making minor

‘improvements.in radio facilities previously installed

in Bolivia and Guatemala.

ce. Initiated. a study, to be completed during the first
week in April, -on the feasibility and desirability of
establishing intelligence centers at Caribbean Command
and Caribbean Sea Frontier Headquarters for rapid pro-
cessing and dissemination to countries concerned, via
the American Ambassadors, of the intelligence on the
movement of subversives.

d. Directed establishment of a U.S. military alerting
system for the Caribbean area, by which intelligence on
subversive movement can be rapidly transmitted to United
States Ambassadors in countries concerned. CINCARIB
has sufficient communication facilities to initiate the
system, and improvement of these facilities is continu-
ing. . \
