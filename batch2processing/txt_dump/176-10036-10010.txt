INR . Sources. in tshombe’ s offce are close mouthed regarding report
originating that Tshombe plans leave this week.to mee U Thant
in: Europe or New York. CAS has report that as of. late July 9
Tshombe planned leave on or immediately after July 11

_Independence cermonies., Tshombe is quoted as saying: Brigadier

Rikhye extended. invitation on behalf U Thant.

Rikhye gave me opposite. impression, i.e. Thant unlikely receive
{Tshombe at this stage. One observer believes that Tshombe

may be using this gimmick as cover. for trip to Europe to look
discreetly ‘into. Du Farron'’s reported betrayal which if known
could. compromise: Tshombe seriously (Brussels telegram 34. to

’ Department).
