1. QUESTION: If Fidel should suidenly Jie or be killed, whet kind of struggle
for power would ensue ani whet element would win out/

2. ANSWERS “Even the gusanos say it would be useless to kill Fidel; the thicg
would go on. No one thinks Fidel's death would be useful to the counter-revolution.

Maybe it would in the long run, but certainly not in the dort run. It ig hard to sar
what would happen. Power is in the hands of a few peopie. Some amall group (gruvito:
would fora ani take power strongly into its hands and hold the thing together. ‘YWnzt
would happen then is again hard to say; even harder is it to pyedict which elenent
would win out. But generally speazing, the oarfudos (and « small group of thea, wt
that) would win out, snd not the cosmunists. In the latter connection, people in

Le Havana seem to think tnat Blas Roca and Lazaro Peng are now longer powerful figures.

| Of the old cowmunists, Carlos Rafael Rodvicuez is the most prestigious. R Funez

soe Jimenez could make a comebuck, although he is not too important at this time. The +

Minister of Labor, Martinez Sanchez, is very important.
