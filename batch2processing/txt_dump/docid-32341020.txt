: Informant advised that OSCAR ANGULO, reporter
fov Miami Radio Station WMIE, (under development as a Pst)
is in frequent contact with BOSCH and apparently has
knowledge of BOSCH's plans..

MM 635-S said that FELIPE RIVERO DIAZ and his
cxganization in Miami is completely inactive but that
RIVERO has great personai, hatred for BOSCH and possibiy
would do anything to cause BOSCH difficulty.

     

| OSCAR ANGULO on 6/17/68, was interviewed by the
Miemi Office and was, completely cooperative. He said he
po is im contact with BOSCH, who continues in. his plans to bomb
i" . ships trading with Cuba. BOSCH said his men had planned
. . “to .bomb another Japanese ship in Miami but spotted police
security. measures and called off this attempt.

 

On 6/19/68, ANGULO reported BOSCH claimed he has

man io Wassau, Bahemas, checking charter flights from

au.to Havana. These flights are used by UN personnel
travel to Havana, and ANGULO ‘believes BOSCH is
ing the possibility of bombing one of these flights,
claims he has a Cuban national in Mexico working with
an airline company and available to put a bomb
on a Mexican airliner when BOSCH so orders it.

. , with ANGULO and is considering..interview of RIVERO,
