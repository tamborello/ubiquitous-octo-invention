in the hall — the TV men with their big sowid-on-filn
camoras sot up. At the end of the three-hour session,
however, the Chief Justice did have a few minor comients
to make and let me bring in the reporters to hear them,
but without cameras and mikes. He cooperates with the
press, but doesn't get pushed around. John NoCloy, one
of the Commision members, just sat thore and glowored,
The second dey waa a re-run of the first. Hopefully,

the Commission will get a staff this coming week and

the mechanics of the sessions will operate more smoothly.

The Chief Justice docsn't care for security measures at
all — in fact, I gathor that he distains them. Thore is
no formal protection for him in his position. Knovring the
fury that his name evokes in some quarters, I find the
ieck of security a worriesome thing. His car didn't come
for him for some reason at the ond of the second meeting and
mm stood at the curb with Senator John Sherman Cooper for
about 10 minutes. The Archivist and I drove out of the basoment
at that time, found them otanding there and gave them a lift
up to the Hill. Mr. Warren has been very gracious to us,
most aporecintive for the few things that we have been able
to do for him andthe Commission.

This slight involvenent with the start of the Comminsion's
meetings, coupled to the mission to Port Worth, has me fecling
that I have been looking in on history. They are experioncos
which I would have gladly foregone.

421 of us are well hore. Give our love to Larchmont and
New Rochelle.

Best regards,

Dear Dave;

Please accept my warmest thanks for your thoughtfulness in
providing me with those unexpteted photographs taken in front of
the Hotel Texas in Fort Worth.

It was a pleasure working with you, Marjorie, Raymond Buck and
others on the arrangements for the Fort Worth breakfast, It was a
day that onded tragically but at least we have the satisfaction of know-
ing that President Kennedy obviously appeared very pleased by the
Fort Worth program.

I regret that it was not possible to see Marjorie when she visited
Washington. However, we did have a chance to talk on the telephone
when she visited Jim Wright's office.

The next time Iam in Fort Worth I intend to drop in and see you
because my memory of your hospitality and cooperation is as pleasant
as can be.

Thank you again for the pictures and give my best regards to Marjorie
and your children,

Sincerely, ~

Dear Harry:

By a series of odd coincidences, I have been moving
about on the fringes of events connected to the tragedy of
Dallas. Last woek the Commission anpointed by President
Kenuedy Johnson to invostigate the death of President
Kennedy held its first two meetings in the National
Archives and I served as the Commission's Press Officer
on these two occasions. w/e had been asked to provide
a meoting place for the organizational meetings of the
Commission and offered Chief Justice Warren a quiet conference
room in the National Archives. Apparently the Chief Justice
wants to keep unrelated the functions of the Supreme Court
and the Commission; this desire, again apparently, oxtends
to physical facilities and pergonnel. No press aide camo
over to the Archivos frm the Suprome Court. By agreement
of the Chief Justice and the Archivist of tho United States,
therefore, I was designated to attempt to bring a little
order from the press chaos that occurs in Washingtn at the
scene of any sigmificant news event.

My function has been to act as a sort of “press policeman"
rather than spokesman, The Chief Justice himself ha s sorved
as the Commission spokesman.

Last Thursda y the first meeting was held and there was a
horde of reporters and photographers on hand to provide a
crowd scene in tho "quiet" Archives. Working with the
Archivist and other officials, we arranged reasonable security
with uniformed and plain clothes seourity mon. Talkin a
lead from Dallas, we required all pross people to present
credentials. The section of the Archives where tho conferonce
room is situated was placed off limits to other persons,

The Chief Justice suggested that I bring in the photographers
at the start of the session so they could get their picturos
ond then get the holl out; he said to tell the roportersa that
there would ba no statement because the Commission work wag
just barely setting under way. He allowed me to divide tha
photographers into two groups — stills and TV — becaus e
there was so many of thom. An amusing thing happoned: I
took in the "stills" to shoot tro minutes, then asin d them

to gt out and let the TV men come in with thoir handheld
movie cameras. Ondé of the "stills" snenked tack in with the
TV mon but he was immediately informed upon by his colleagues
who banged on the door and pushed their wy part ray in,
calling to me “lie's cheating! He's a hog!" So he got tha
bums rush, Although the Chief Justice said there would be
no statement, some 40 reporters and seven TV crews ramaine

Dear John:

This clipping from this morning's Star-Telegram
will indicate the strong interest in Americanism
which the Fort Worth Elk's Lodge has; and it will
further substantiate our sincere desire to receive
an American flag from the President during his
visit to Fort Worth, If it is impossible for him
to present it at the Elks* Lodge, would it be
possible for him to make a private presentation
at the Hotel Texas?

Two half-page ads have been purchased in both
daily newspapers, urging all individuals to take an
active part in "Know your America" Week,
