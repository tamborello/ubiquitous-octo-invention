The total take from these machines was $11,000-$5,500 to the

To stimulate interest in bingo, [Jana BUCKNER
offered as a door prize a mink stole. After considerable
advertising regarding the door prize of the mink stole,
1600 people were in attendance the night it was given
away at the casino of the Sans Souci.

[ __Jacaea that the "wise guys" felt that
this attendance was a "fluke." To show that they could
keep the attendance high,[[ _] stated the holders of ticket
stubs for the mink stole door prize were told that the stub
was warth $1.00 to play bingo on the following Monday evening.
explained that Monday was the worst night for attendance
at the Sans Souci. On this Monday night, 1100 people wer@ai.
attendance at the Sans Souci. As a result of this
increased attendance and the promise that he and BUCKNER:
would supervise the entire gambling operation of the Z
Sans Souci, they were to be given the concession of binge&s,Z

stated that because bingo consistently
lost, he and BUCKNER did not feel that they could make any
money. He stated that the bingo concession lost an average
of $22,000 a month. He and BUCKNER, therefore, proposed

that they be given a percentage of the entire gambling operation

“of the Sans Souci. They pointed out that if $22,000 was the
average loss per month and they operated the concession in
the future for say $10,000 loss, they would in fact have
made $12,000 for the casino. If bingo, for a given month,
would. break even they would have made $22,000 for the casino.
They also pointed out that they could keep attendance high
at bingo by offering door prizes, etc., and that the side
games of "21, roulette and crap" would naturally profit from
the added attendance. .

s a result of the above and with the understanding
that and BUCKNER manage the entire operation of the
Sans Souci, the breakdown was then to be:

TRAFFICANTE hog

20% of the Sans Souci he was offered the opportunity

to see the books and observe the overall operation of

the casino. He stated that for a period of about. two weeks,
he watched the operation of "21, roulette and crap,"

giving particular interest and attention to the security

of the money to make sure "No one was taking off the top."

He added that during the course of his
obversation of the casino he talked to the cashier, a Cuban
national who said the "bank" for the Sans Souci was about
$400,000. On closer scrutiny of the books, howevegg he
determined that the actual cash on hand was $16,000 and the
remainder of the $400,000 was in I.0.U.'s and checks
"dated from the year 1", which he considered worthless.

put any money into the operation of the Sans Souci.

Cuba but that all casinos, hotels, etc. have a large number
