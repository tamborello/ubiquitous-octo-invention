"is concaivable that this went out before I talked to Bissell,

do not exclude that, but the two were totally in tandem.

Mr. Baron. Having taken a look at all of the documents
, that Ws are about to introduca into the record today, befora
i we begin taking your tastimony on the record, are you ‘able to
Pinpoint with any more precision your initfal discussion with
Mr. Biseell of the prospect of assassinating Lumumba?
Mr. Tweedy. Pinpoint it in terme of time?
Baron. Yas.
Tweedy. No, not in terms of time. I can only asauma --
Baron. Tt would have taken place shortly hefore this
Allen Dulles cable?

Mr. Tweedy. Either shortly befors, or shortly after,
because the next series of cables obviously qet the show, as
tt ware, on the road.

May I comment just Ganerally on those cables as a group?
There are no surprises in them as far as I am concernad, in
terms of dutail. Much of it, even to this dav, I still do not
remember.

One aspect emerges very clearly for ms, that wa wers very
Careful about examining this on ths possibilities of doing
anything against Lumumba. Rasically, thia whole nariod was a

or achieve the goal, including, indded assassination, but not ,
by any means limited to- that, that wa were in trouble finding
4 means which appeared secure, particularly means which kept the

U.S. hand hidden. It is the to and from, and the atmosphere

i of it which is very familiar to me; the details of it, much of

; it eVen on reading them, ia rather unfamiliar to me. I found

‘| no surprises in it.

‘ Mr. Baron. Having refreshed your recollection by reviewiaa

il

| these cables, can you add any graater specificity to the record
about the substance of your conversations with Richard Bissell
on the possibility of assassinating Lumumba?

Mr. Twasdy. I think what we usad to do, as T remember it,
when it came to the technical axchanga with the Station on one
asset Versus anothar, the possible security weakness of this
man versus the possible strangths of another, Sissel) left this
largely to me. I do not mean to sav that we did not from tims
to time review it. Ne did not. debate with me on whether(inite }

{[Clamalg} vas somebody who was worth dealing with or not, because
she had Belqian connections, for sxample.
Mr. Baron. You are saving he would heve left the operation
details to you?
Mr. Twesdy. The oparaticnal details of trvina to come us
with some solution that. lookud as if it made senss, and had a@

promise of success. I do not racall that we would discuss this

type of a cable in detail. As you can ses, he relaased quite

the same tima pariod.
This merely confirmed what I think 1 probably heard from
u Mr. Bissell first.
Mr. Baron. In this discussion with Mr. Bissell, you ara
i referring to the subject of getting access to Lumumba for the
‘| purpose of assassination.

Mr. Tweedy. I think it probably came up in the sense that

the thrust 6f the American position was that thera was no

. SOlution in the Congo without the fall from powar of Mr. Lumumba,
and no measure should be overlooked to achiave thie -- constitu-
tional. cavolutionary and indeed, executive action, if you want
to call it that.

Mr. Baron. Meaning assassination?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

But none of these possible measures were uxcluded, and the
main point was that averybody aqreed that lumumba had to qo or
We Were in for very serious trouble in the Congo.

Mr. Baron. You were referring a moment ago in discussing
this cable from Alle: Dulles to the fact. that when you first
discussed the possibility ef assassinatingd Lumumha as one Means
of removing him from power with Richard Bissell, Bissell rafarre}
to this cabls.

Mr. Tweedy. No, I woul-l hava saan this cable whan it went

TESTIMONY OF BRONSON TWEEDY
Mr. Baron. We discussed this cable in your previous
appearance, did we not?
Mr. Tweedy. August 26th.
May I correct the date? It is August 26th.
Baron. Certainly.
Tweedy. It is rather important.

Baron. It is August 26th,

Tweedy. Yes, wa did indeed discuss {¢ the last time.

Baron. After you took another look at this cable

“ this morning before wa went On the record, you made a remark to

the effect that this cable was @ source of authority as far as
you Were concerned at the time.

Is that your impression now?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

Let me just add to that a bit. The cable per se I did not

; Femamber, but £t is perfectly obvious the cable is the authorit..

: When I first talkad to Mr. Bissell about this, he certainly

implied the only reason the subjact was being raised is because
it had been of national policy laval concern. I do not thins
it could be more clear-cut than that. This was basically, this
was the formal axpression of that bv the Diractor himself,

T Cannot remember which came first, did 1 Sea this cable

first, or did I talk to Mr. 3isgaal} first. 1 suspect that

talked to Mr. Hissell first. Tt must have been absolutely iv
