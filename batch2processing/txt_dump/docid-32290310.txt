Obviously “théFéfore’, i thére are conflicting [theories
emanating from highly placed sources. No effort is mdde herein
to evaluate either. iC :

However, it has come to the attention of the Chicago
Office that there is available in Mexico a Goverment official
who-is in position to know of the motives involved in allowing
GIANCANA to stay in Mexico from 1966 to 1974 and why he was’
suddenly expelled in 1974. This official logically would have
implemented the expulsion. He may well know specifically who
it was who wanted GIANCANA expelled in 1974, whether representatives
of organized crime or of forces outside organized crime. This
information would be most helpful in evaluating the motives
behind the killing of GIANCANA, and possibly be pertinent to
the ROSKIL matter .(¥) (w)

 

_. This official is FERNANDO GUTIERREZ BARRIOS, Undersecretary ‘
of the Ministry of Government and an ECHEVERRIA aide. As liaison ry
contact of many years standing, there is reason to believe a 7
discreet direct contact with him by Legat, Mexico City, or by
contacts of the Legat who have also had close, continuing liaison
with him might elicit the desired information. As President
ECHEVERRIA leaves office December 1, 1976, and GUTIERREZ BARRIOS
may also be leaving government, this may be.a particularly

propitious moment for an approach / eW
The Bureau is, therefore, requested to have Legat,

Mexico City approach GUTIE xEZ BARRIOS unless there are strong
reasons not to. 4) \ fw ee

“CG, 92-349

 

~ June, 1966 and lived With him there for almost the entire
period of GIANCANA's hiatus in Mexico, travelling with him
throughout the world and performing many trouble-shooting
jobs for GIANCANA. This PC had many contacts in Mexico
and it was he who encouraged GIANCANA to go there on the
basis that certain privileges co be obtained for him
there. PC introduced GIANCANA tofJORGE CASTILLO, a very .
influential Mexican attorney witPrcontacts in the higher ue
levels of Mexican Government. PC advised that CASTILLO :
made contact with LUIS ECHEVERRIA ALVAREZ, then the Minister  /
of Government in 1966, and now President of Mexico. According
to this information, CASTILLO was able to provide certain |
considerations to °ECHEVERRIA which enabled GIANCANA to remain
in Mexico from 1966*to 1974 even though he had been declared
undesirable, a category which ordinarily precluded a person
from remaining in Mexico. ,As the Legat, Mexico City,
will recall,:many efforts wére made to effect the expulsion
of GIANCANA during this period, but it was not until 1974,. ;
‘some four years after ECHEVERRIA was elected president, » ie
ehat he was expelled. P\4) \ ,

 

VN

Not only from CG 7177-PC, who was somewhat involved,
but from other sources, it is known that GIANCANA was
involved in a CIA plot in the period 1959 into the early
1960s to effect the removal of FIDEL CASTRO in Cuba. Involved
in this plot was JOHN ROSELLI, well documented from many
sources including Chicago highly confidential sources as
a GIANCANA lieutenant. ROSELLI, of course, was murdered
earlier this year in Florida, some several months afteryhis
boss, involved with him in this scheme, was murdered —\ On

CG 6481-CTE; who was very close-to GIANCANA for
decades and during the period upon his return from Mexico
elaims that GIANCANA's murder was not a Chicago mob
eontract, and that he believes the murder was accomplished
by forces outside organized erime.(U)

The other two sources mentioned above, however,
advised that GIANCANA was having a conflict with the
current Chicago organized crime leaders, namely TONY
ACCARDO, GUS ALEX and JOE AIUPPA, over a highly lucrative
source of income which GIANCANA set up while Chicago

- "bess" in the 1950s and 1960s, and which he claimed
. thereafter was his personal project and one not belonging
te Chicago organized crime. CG 7177-PC furnished this
information prior to his own gangland slaying in December,
\ 1973, while CG 7016-CTE advised of it subsequent to the
. killing of GIANCANA and prior to his own natural sent (4
