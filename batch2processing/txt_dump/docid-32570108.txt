to get a copy of an upsto-date list. I am tempted to refer then
"Air Guide", but not having been here at the time, and not having
copy-of the original list in our records, I am somewhat. at a loi
as to the length of the list or the status of either "Air Guide
or the Pilot's Association.

“3. I quite appreciate that you may not be able to supply

list but I should be glad to. know more about the Pilot's Associ ct a
before I return to the charge with the Bahamas. :
