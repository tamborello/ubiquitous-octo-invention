. In my memorandum of August 22, 1963, information was set
forth that Benjamin Bertram Sigelbaum, who is involved#in the *
transfer and concealment of skimmed funds from the Las,,Vegas gambling
casinos, attempted to explain how lucrative the Swiss banking
business is, Sigelbaum stated that the banks lend monéy to African
countries at 12 per cent and 15 per cent interest and that they
receive government bonds of these countries, which, if: defaulted,
are apparently underwritten by the U. S. Government. The Director
asked ‘Just ‘how does this work?" wh ast

“=- This information was furnished by highly? confidential -
sources 3 thovt further comment or elaboration.. Sigelbaum and his
associétes have previously expressed a desire to invest funds in fi
the owi’rship.of a Swiss bank, but this is the first information wé
have received to indicate any knowledge on their‘part of Swiss banking
investiient practices. ‘ .
co = wise woe o
John Grosvenor, Chief Counsel, Bureau of Public Deb&? U.S.
| Treasury, Department, advised that there is no blanket underwriting of
| foreign »govérnment bonds as such by the U..S. Government. The U.S.
Governmént <dées agree to underwrite particular projects in foreign.

|countfries for: their economic development. This may be done ‘through ;
the State Department, Defense Department or some other agency. A’
particular-foreign country, with such<a project, issues béfids through
its own agencies to finance the cost of the ‘project. , Such bond issues
fréquéntly-‘offer better interest rates than our own banks’ There is
a widegvariation among these interest rates. It is necessary to
onsider specific countries and projects to determine exactly what
heparticular rate of return on a bond issue would be.
