Title; John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act
of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The Act established the Assassination Records Review-
Board (ARRB) to oversee the government’s production and
compliance with the Act. The ARRB reviews the ‘proposed
postponements in documents sent by each agency to the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and decides what
postponements the Act will allow or opens the document in full.
The ARRB’s responsibilities include having agencies search other

C subjects and areas to find additional material not already
identified as assassination records. The establishment of the
ARRB by the Act also limited the time for their duties to be
accomplished. The ARRB must complete their tasks by September
1998. With this deadline in mind, the ARRB sent a letter
requesting additional information.

Details: ..On February 10, 1997, the ARRB sent a letter to the FBI
setting £o¢th a formal request to receive and review additional
records. The ARRB’s goal is to research every possible subject
that may have a bearing on assassination theories and/to assure
Congress and the American public that all was done to! accomplish
‘the intentions of the Act. v

Pursuant to the Act, any material categorized as an
assassination record must be sent to the NARA in its original
form. ‘The Act established the process of handling the documents
and the FBI must follow the Act. If Houston believes there
office needs a copy, they should copy the documents or material
before sending to the JFK Task Force.
