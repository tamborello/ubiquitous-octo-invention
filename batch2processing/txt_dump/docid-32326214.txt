MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING
{ACCOUNTING AND FRAUD SECTION)

(CO;LA)

Rerep SA Grant C. Earl dated 6/12/62 at Los Angeles.

fhe Bureau does not agree with the observations of the
Los Angeles Office set forth on the cover pages of rerep concern-
ing the interviews with Dave Pick, Joseph Sternbach, John B.
Stevenson and Charles K, Hackler.

It is noted that the original source. of information
in this case is LA 4350-C.. This source indicated that Joseph
Sternbach, a CPA, has been Matula’s accountant and that the source
knew for a fact Sternbach dislikes Matula very much and would
possibly be of assistance in anh investigation of Matule. Source
described Stexrnbach as a "big crook."

With reference to Stevenson, LA 4350-C described him
as a former West Coast attorney for the Teamsters Union who
is presently semi-retired. The source further indicated that
Stevenson's office in Los Angeles is run by attorney Charles EK.
Hackier, whom Hoffa does not respect. Among other things, the
source reported that Stevenson holds approximately 80 per cent
of Matula's cash and that Stevenson has a boat in Honolulu, where
it ig suspected that currency may be hidden.

Rerep reflects that Stevenson may presently reside
in Playa del Rey.

 

‘tolsomanset ss Concerning Dave Pick, this same source stated that “
Belnont ———aeula has been "shaking down" the rubbish dealers in Los Angeles

RE: JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA
- FRANK J. MATULA, JR

63-7145

for years and that a number of years ago Pick, a Beverly Hills
attorney, was involved with Matula in these shakedowns. The
source added. that a great deal of money Matula received went
through the hands of Pick. The source indicated that Pick

and Matula are no longer associated with each other and Pick is

an individual who would have a great deal of information concerning
Matula's activities.‘

 

In order that this investigation will completely
resolve all of the information received. from LA 4350-C, the
Bureau feels that Pick, Sternbach, Stevenson and Hackler must
be interviewed. It may well be that these individuals will claim
attorney-client privilege; however, until actual contact is
made with these individuals, this appears to be merely an
assumption... In view of this the Bureau desires that these
individuals be immediately interviewed in detail for all informa-
tion they may be able to furnish concerning Matula's activities
and the information furnished by LA 4350-C. Extreme caution
should be used in these interviews in order that the original
source will not be disclosed. These interviews should be handled
by two mature, experienced Special Agents.

In connection with the information developed in this
investigation concerning possible income tax violation, the Los
Angeles Office is instructed to immediately incorporate this
information into a letterhead memorandum suitable for dissemination
to the Criminal Division and Internal Revenue Service. (IRS)

The identity of all confidential sources should be protected;’°
however, T symbols should not be utilized in the letterhead
memorandum. Five copies of this letterhead memorandum should be
forwarded to the Bureau in order that dissemination can be made

to the Criminal Division and IRS headquarters in Washington, D. C.
& copy of the letterhead memorandum should also be furnished

IRS in Los Angeles. : : i

During your next contact with Department attorney
Charles 2. Smith, you should inform him that the Bureau is also
disseminating information concerning possible violation of if€ome tax
laws to IRS in Los Angeles and Washington, D. C.

The investigation outlined herein is to be handled
immediately and report submitted reflecting completion of this
investigation within 10 days of receipt of this communication.
