Title: JOHN F. KENNEDY RECORDS COLLECTION
ACT OF 1992 (THE ACT).

Synopsis: The JFK Task Force requested each Field Office to
“conduct a new indices search for any additional information
related to President John F. Kennedy’s assassination that may
have been placed on record since the previous search.

Enclosures: Enclosed for FBIHQ are 24 books and one volume of
the main Report titled “The President’s Commission on the
Assassination of President Kennedy’.

 

Details: The enclosed 24 books and main volume of the Report of
"The President’s Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy’, were inadvertently located in the steno pool ina file
cabinet in the Kansas City Division. Apparently, the books were
placed in the cabinets years ago for storage and were not labeled
as the volumes were public source information. The contents of
the cabinets were being boxed up in anticipation of the move of
the Kansas City Division and therefore, these items are being
forwarded to FBIHQ for review.

Kansas City does not request the return of these books.
