FBI Identification Division, CAVALLARO was arrested on

6/28/34, by ATU, NYC, as CHARLES DI FRANCESCO; on 8/12/36,

by NYC PD as JOSEPH TROPICANO on a charge of 1897 petit larceny
(blackjack); and at ATU, Buffalo, 8/29/36, on inquiry.

ABRAM D, ARMSTEAD, graduate, Howard University
Medical School, Washington, D.C., wnose license to practice
medicine was suspended as a result of abortion, advised that
previously the Naples brothers brought him on the average
two abortion patients per weel and, at the present time, he
-is averaging about two abortions a month.

ARMSTEAD stated that of late he has been almost
wholly oecupied with the job of handicapping and betting
horses, and prior to the bombing-murder of VINCENT J, DE NIRO
(7/17/61), he placed his bets through DE NIRO and always was
paid when he won. After the death of DE NIRO, CAVALLARO moved
into DE NIRO's operation, and he won about $2,000 or $3,000
on horse bets and could not collect. Some time after this
he was held up by one JOE (LNU), a pickup man for CAVALLARO,
who, with another individual, took about $200 or $300 from him.

ARMSTEAD stated he definitely knew that CAVALLARO
moved into DE NIRO's operation and, for this reason, believed
that CAVALLARO was at least partially responsible for the death
of DE NIRO. .

PCI Lromrgl aavisea that about two or three weeks
before DOMINIC was found murdered at Canton, Ohio (9/3/63),

she saw and talked with MOIO at the Center Sandwich Shop,
Youngstown, Ohio, operated by the NAPLES brothers, where he
was talking with JOSEPH and JIMMIE NAPLES, She recognized
MOIO from his pictures being in the newspapers. While she

did not know his name before, she recalled that in 1961 and
1962 she saw MOIO in the company of BILLY NAPLES (bombing-murder
victim, 7/1/62). PCI thought it odd that MOIO was with the
NAPLES brothers, inasmuch as there has been much talk that
MOIO was responsible for the death of BILLY NAPLES. PCI heard
at the time of MOIO's death that JOSEPH NAPLES had gone out of
town to meet MOIO and now believes that the NAPLES brothers
were pretending to be friendly with MOIO by not blaming him
for the death of BILLY NAPLES, so they could maneuver him into
a position to kill him.
