The (RRS foregoing conversation is of interest from two
respective sides, one being the mention of the name "SOBNNY the.
~-BUGae who ss aonivaRLL, a well-known syndicate strong=
. ho is repor ye involved in, among other, things, ‘the * Qe.
ty gangland shooting of a former FBI informant, JOH] HENNIGAN ~T
\“ « in whigh shooting VARELLI-wasreporteayy tava vit
Fi BUCCLERI and his brother, FRAN (BUCCIERI Secoadty, Sine
ve--to-MC GUIRE is believed to Be probably a reference to
Gi ‘RE, presently an investigator for the State's
A enéral's Office and a Republican candidate for one of .'
the posts of Trustee of the Chicago Sanitary District. MC GUIRE ;
has been reported in the past by CG 6343-C* to be. close to . :
several of Chicago's top hoodlums and to have been contacted ~ i
by them in the past for favors,

        
 
 

MARCI then continues in a conversation with VIC (LNU)-
concerning the police raid on the Showboat Lounge, a Loop. -
strip joint referred to earlier by this informant in which MARCI
evidently is one of the controlling influences in the operation
of this club. Investigation, to date has failed to indicate who
ROMEY might be but it is felt probable that this is someone
-eonnected with the Chicago Police Department who has the responsibility
of advising MARCI of impending raids on “the outfit's" locations.
Their conversation was as follows: . -

MARCI: VIC come on in, Listen tell ROMEY,, get ahold of
him right now. Tell him they knocked off the
Showboat last night. They went in and nailed
it last night and we didn't have no tip off or
. . - nothing that they were coming in there and it's
; a (obs) pinch. They just made the pinch.

| so, vic: mo They nailed the joint? It was knocked off, last .

oo night? I'11 have him call you, if I can get hin.

MARCI: ~ Tell him the guy with that other joint is JOHNNY.

vIC: "+ The Chez. He said that. .
: ; MARCI: : There was no reason for it. And they didn't let me :
_ know. Have him call me VIC.
VIC: Z'11 be in touch. (leaves). |
