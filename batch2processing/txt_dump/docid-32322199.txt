Dear Director Anton Widmer:

I am writing to you about a matter that I believe to be important to the FBI and to the
United States people.

The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, 44
U.S.C.§2107(Supp. V 1994) (the Act) {copy enclosed) was enacted by the United States Congress
and signed into law by President George Bush on October 26, 1992. The purpose of the Act is to
preserve and maintain all United States governmental documents in one area, the National Archives
and Records Administration (Archives), for access to those individuals interested in the history
surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The Act states that, “[a]ll government
records concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of
immediate disclosure,” and requires all United States government agencies to find all documents
related to the assassination and to review and release the identified documents to the maximum
extent possible to the public. The FBI has been working diligently since 1993 to fulfill our
responsibilities under the Act.

The purpose of this letter is: (1) to inform you that the FBI’s assassination records contain
information originating with your agency or your original documents, (2) to respectfully request
that your agency review your information for maximum disclosure to the fullest extent possible, and
(3) to explain the provisions for your request to protect your information from disclosure.

To achieve maximum disclosure of assassination records, the Act established the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board (the Board). The Board is an independent Federal agency
’ charged with overseeing the identification and release of records related to the assassination from
the other Federal agencies. The FBI has assured the Board of our continued dedication of
cooperating with them to meet the objectives of the Act. In that spirit, the FBI would appreciate

Director Anton Widmer

your agency’s review of the enclosed assassination records and consideration of whether the
information can be released.

If your agency has no objection to the release of its information in the enclosed records, please
notify the FBI so that we may take steps to release the records to the Archives. If your agency
determines that the information cannot be released, please provide an explanation that the FBI may
present the evidence to the Board for their approval. The Act requires the FBI to present “clear and
convincing evidence” of a harm that would outweigh the need for public disclosure to the Board for any
information that we request to protect from disclosure. Such evidence to protect information is explained
in the Act as, “the public disclosure of the assassination record would compromise the existence of an
understanding of confidentiality currently requiring protection between a Government agent and a
cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public disclosure would be so harmful that it
outweighs the public interest.” Upon receipt of your instructions and explanation for the protection from
disclosure; the FBI wiil provide the information to the Board and request that they sustain the request for
withholding the information from disclosure.

Please be aware that the Act requires that a// information in the assassination collection at
Archives (even in the closed section) be released to the public in the year 2017, including information
that the Board agrees to protect. The Act has provisions to extend postponements (protection of
information from disclosure) past 2017 with the certification of the President of the United States that the
information continues to meet the requirements for postponement. The FBI will periodically review the
postponed material for the need of this certification. .

As you know, the FBI normally protects information from your agency pursuant to applicable
Executive Orders and the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts exemptions. However, the Act is a
unique Federal law that applies only to JFK assassination records. Please note, it is our opinion that
release of information in the JFK assassination records should not in the future affect the FBI’s standard
policy of protecting your agency’s information in other investigations or in other contexts.

The FBI is committed to the opening of all information related to the assassination to the United
States public, but appreciates that certain information is sensitive and not proper for release. Therefore,
the FBI requests your consideration and understanding of this matter and the continuance of your
outstanding association with our agency.

Thank you, in advance, for your cooperation. Please direct any questions to our Legat Office
representative or to Carol L. Keeley, Acting Unit Chief of the Historical and Executive Review Unit of
the FBI, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20535, (202) 324-0671.

Sincerely yours,

Louis J. Freeh

Re: United States Federal Bureau of Investigation Records Relating to the
Assassination of President John F. Kennedy

 

 

Dear Director Widmer:

The Assassination Records Review Board, which is an independent agency of the
United States government, is honored to present to your government a request on
behalf of the people of the United States of America.

The assassination of President John F. Kennedy was one of the great tragedies for the
American people in this century. Since the time of his assassination, a majority of the
American people have believed that ail relevant information has not become publicly
known. In order to respond to this concern, the United States Congress passed
legislation, signed into law by President Bush, that created the Assassination Records
Review Board. This law is known as the President foun F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994). The five members of the
Assassination Records Review Board are citizens of high standing who were appointed
by President Clinton and confirmed by the United States Senate.

The principal mission of the Review Board is to transfer records in government files to

the United States National Archives so that they can be examined by historians,

scholars, and researchers. Asa part of its mission, the Review Board has been working

with U.S. government agencies during the past three years -- including the FBI -- to

declassify records to the greatest extent possible. The FBI has notified us that some
information in its files on the assassination originated with your government. FBI

officials have copies of these records that they will make available for your en
examination.

The Review Board respectfully requests that your government take all reasonable steps
to help make the information in these records available to the United States National
Archives. Accordingly, we request that your government consent to the release of its
information in these records to the greatest extent possible.
