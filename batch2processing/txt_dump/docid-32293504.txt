a gangster and it was the informant's first impression of

i meeting a gangster. He knew nothing about ROSELLI'S

{ activities at that time and knew him only very casually until
after the war, when he met ROSELLI again at Eagle Lion Studios

“where informant, who was a writer, worked on some films in
which ROSELLI had an interest.

Informant said that ROSELLI has frequently mentioned
what a terrible thing it was to have to be incarcerated in 4
prison and has stated that he never wants to go to prison
again.

; Informant stated that in his opinion, ROSELLI is
"sex crazy", that women play a very important part in his
life, and he is "always looking for women",

. Informant said that he honestly believes that
ROSELLI has reformed in recent years; that he, informant,
knows nothing wrong concerning ROSELLI'S activities at the
oa present time. He has never heard any information which
a would indicate to him that ROSELLI is engaged in gambling
or bookmaking activities in the Los Angeles area. He said
