On February 6, 1958, the same source advised

that he was specifically referred to Pat Marcy, John

D'Arco's Secretary, in order to receive permission to put |
a 26 game into an establishment in which the source had an
interest, 26 game being a small gambling-type card game
which is illegal according to the ‘City ordinances of Chicago,
‘The culmination of Marcy's efforts was the arrangement whereby
Maxwell Police District Plainclothesman known as “Smokey”
was paid $50 per month in order to overlook the 26 game..
‘The same source advised that Alderman D'Arco on other
occasions had referred him:to Pat Marcy in order to eliminate
competition from Maxwell Street sidewalk consessions, . which
were in effect individuals without licenses who sold their
wares in the street. Marcy settled the dispute, for which ;
he demanded several hundred dollars per year so long as the
settlement was binding. The unique method of payment to
Marcy came about when the source was assessed several hundred
dollars for tickets to the Democratic organization's picnic,
usually held in the ‘summertime, Tickets were 50 cents per
and Marcy simply collected enough tickets to cover the
several hundred dollars, which was in fact payment to Marcy
for settling the above-mentioned dispute. ~

On August 24, 1962,. source advised that an individual
closely associated with Pat Marcy had informed him that
Marcy had given orders for all of the "strip joints" in the
Igeop to be temporarily closed down with the exception of
three, Marcy mentioned that Eddie Foys.was one of the three
which was to remain open. -Marcy in his ‘conversation indicated
but did not specifically say that Gus Alex had given the
order for the strip joints to temporarily go down. . Marcy
explained that "they" have about 10 to 12 million dollars
invested in the Sahara Motel and that "they" are trying to
get as much convention trade to the Sahara as possible. "They"
figure that if they temporarily cut down some of the strip.
joints which attract conventioneers to the Loop area of :
Chicago and to Loop hotels, many of the conventioneers flying
to Chicago and landing at O'Hare Field will go to the Sahara |
Motel nearby to conduct their convention business. Marcy ,
inicated that plans are to keep the Loop areasof Chicago
as. far as "outfit" controlled strip joints as quiet as
possible temporarily in order to build up business at the
Sahara Motel.
