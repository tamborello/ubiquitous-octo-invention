r4, Supply Drops - Cuba

Gen, Cabell explained that the Pinar de Rio supply mission had
not taken place because of the absence of specified communication
from the DZ, and the Escambray operation had been canceled because
of weather. He said that these missions are still planned, and assumed
_that the Group had no objections. The members 50 signified.
“5,. U-2, Cuba
Gen. Cabell said that the photographic coverage on the first
flight had been only about 50%, because of cloud cover. He continued
that we are analyzing the exact results on a priority basis and that
some time after the middle of next week we should be in a position to

make recommendations for the missions required to extend the coverage.

Mr. Gray commented somewhat wryly that this was all right with
him since he ''would certainly not.be available to discuss anything of
this kind before the middle of next week," The other members appeared
to have the same reaction. ,

V6, Policy Consideration Re Cuban Exiles

 

Mr, Gray said that Assistant Attorney General Yeagley had spoken

to him after his meeting with Col. King and Messrs. Esterline and
(Holman.) He had said that the information given to him by the CLA

representatives, and the arrangements for future coordination if

necessary, were entirely satisfactory to him. He had stated, however,

that a problem remains with respect to action the FBI should take;

that is, the FBI needs guidance in its handling of Cuban exile groups

other than those under the direction-of CIA.

 

The Group agreed that the best way to attack this problem would
be to have Mr. Yeagley attend next week's Special Group meeting and
discuss the matter at first hand. Mr. Parrott was asked to make
arrangements forthis. ; ne
