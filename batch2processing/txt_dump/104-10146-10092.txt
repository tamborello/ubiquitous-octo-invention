Page 2, Footnote 14. Scratch our negative comment. The initial
concern was over the date of formation of the CRC (late 1960 or early
1961). Stating that it was formed shortly before the 17 April 19617
Bay of Pigs operation is acceptable. (c)

Dear Bob:

This letter is to correct some observations made in my earlier
letter of 23 February about the Cuban exile organizations. I seem to
have misunderstood some of the views given me by my colleagues at the
meeting at which we put together our comments. Call it an “errata
sheet" on my efforts, if you will; perhaps jt was in the euphoria
over the readability of the draft: (U)

MIRR (C)
In addition to commenting on the incorrect description of CIA

relations with Johnson and Sturgis, it is noted that the source used .
may be FBI reporting, which is not necessarily likely to be authoritative. (Cc)

 

Gobierno en Exilio (C)

Footnote 63. We do not have both references, So withdraw our comments
as to what both documents say; one may say what our copy of one of them
does not. (U)

Footnote 64. The cited document does not mention the described visit
to Somoza in Nicaragua. It does reveal that Sierra visited Bogota, Colombia,
but he is not identified as one of the Cuban exiles who visited the Isle

de Andres. (S)

voc (Cc)
as
Footnotes 18-19. Both ate in one sentence in the text, and relate
to Batista Falla's Yet, the first footnote 1s
based on an FBI document. As noted betore, there is no “Operational
Approval Form." (S)
