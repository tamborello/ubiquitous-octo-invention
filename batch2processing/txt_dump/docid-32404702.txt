How does this conform with the Regulations?
I do not remember,

We again are confronted with a question -- whether, ((as)) you say,

they did not request your card, or you do not remember.

I do not say that they did not request it; I am saying that they

did not ask me,

It means that you were not in the Komsomol.

((In a low voice.)) I can not say anything more; think what you want.
We will not say this is "think what you want",

I cannot tellyyou anything more.
I tell you I am trying, explaining the way I know it; What I know,

I know; what I do not know, I do not know.

To hear a Secretary of a Komsomol organization say that they did

not request the card but issued a new one -~ this is absurd.

Why did I make that conclusion?
Because no one asked me -= neither the girl in the registry group,
nor the member of the bureau of the Komsomol asked me anything

((such as)) "Listen ((B's surname)), let us weite down where and what,"
Well, it would be logical to ask this; let us assume ....

Logical, logical,
In case they had to request my card from the old place where I was
on the rolls, it would be logical for them to ask me; this is why I

made the conclusion that they did not request it.

Then how could it happen, for example, if you came to them ... they
accepted you for work in the KGB -=- we will assume you came to the
Secretary of the MVD Komsomol with the Komsomol card.

The Komsomol card does not indicate the punishment,

If there are, in the Komsomol card, ten punishments, then what about

the questions of accepting you for work in the organs of the MVD?

The punishments will be indicated in the Personnel file.
The Personnel file will indicate that you had a punishment in the
Party or Komsomol.

Indeed it will be there.

It will be there, that is true, but the basic document for Komsomol

punishments is the Komsomol card.

The card on the Komsomol member which is maintained on him at the

place where he is on the rolls.

My question =- all of the time, we have been going over it the whole
day -= how could they put you on the rolls of the Komsomol without

seeing your Komsomol card?

I did not just come in off the street.

Look how you are making your judgement -- as if it were the Komsomol
Committee accepting me for work.

I already was accepted for work -- this is the work of Personnel,
Now would the Komsomol Committee regulate the work of Personnel?

No.

Again -- you know little about what goes on.

No one says that the Komsomol Committee controls the work.

For a man who was just about to leave the Komsomol, the Secretary of .
the Komsomol Committee probably will speak to the Personnel Department
about what they think.

They have plenty of their own over-age personnel ((Komsomol members)).
I do not know whether they talked or not =~ they would not inform me.

Had you not been a Secretary, perhaps it would not be worthwiiile
asking these questions =~ because, as a Secretary of a Komsomol
organization, you must know this, because it is daily and routine work.

You do not have to learn the work,it works itself in.

I do not know, I do not know, I can not say.

If you were the Secretary of the Komsomol organization of the Second
Chief Directorate, even without knowing where the card had been in

the Baltic area, you would be able to answer this question.

Very well, I can tell you, of course, according to how it is supposed
to be.

I am telling you, not because I remember == I do not remember; the
ecard, of course, should be in: the Political Department.

In the Political Department there is a section, a Komsomol Committee,
which guides all of the Komsomol organizations, all of the primary
organizations in the Fourth Fleet.

But, I do not remember that, and I tell you I do not remember.

Well, when the Secretary asked you where you were enrolled, he had

in mind whereyyour card was; what didyyou answer him? .

1 told him that I was a Komsomol member of the Komsomol organization
of the Navy Intelligence Point of the Fourth Navy Fleet.

That is all.

Do you think that they ask that the card be sent?

Nothing of the kind.

They issue a new one,

Well, are you telling the way it was in fact or are you making this

up just to pass the time away?
IT am not making anything up.
When you say ....

Well, then they should have asked me, there in the MVD, "Tell us
the number of the military unit to which to send for inquiries".

But no one asked me these things.

If they did not ask you these things, how could they request your...

card?

I am telling you that they certainly did not ask for the card.

A. Well, what did he ask you?

B. It was about where I was on the rolls, when I entered the Komsomol,
what kind of Komsomol tasks I have had, whether I held a responsible

Komsomol position.

A, One minute, he asked you where you were on the rolls.

What did you tell him?

B. ((Pause)) He did not ask me like that; he asked when I entered;
I told him I entered the Komsomol in 1943. ,
So, I had had no punishments.
Had I been elected to a responsible position?
I was once elected in the Far East, where I started to work in 1950;
I had been elected in 1951.
I was elected Secretary of the Party organization; this was my only
elective office, but I fulfilled other tasks as a rank-and-file

Komsomol member,
A, Again ... Party or Komsomol?

B, Komsomol.
Where was I last on the rolls?
I told him I was at the Navy Intelligence Point on the Baltic, in the
Fourth Navy Fleet.
I was on the rolls there for only a few months.
What else did he ask me?
I do not remember.

He might have asked about my family status, about education....
((XG; A and B speak at the same time.))

A, Well, I will ask a leading question -~ where was your personal

Komsomol file located when you were working in the Baltic?

_B, What Komsomol file?

Here, there is only a personal Komsomol record card.

A, Where was it?

I remember only that, on the Tsentral'nyy Street (proyezd) side,
there was a very well-known, famous bar, in a basement -= I remember
this.

But what kind of building there was before this, I do not remember;

but in 1953, there was no "Detskiy Mir".

((In English.)) Well,

if you worked there, you would know exactly what was there,
I do not remember.

And, probably, if you had worked there, you would have dropped in
there several times. ,

And that will be my next question.

But, please; I am telling you; please == I do not remember what

was there before the "Detskiy Mir".

There was some kind of building, but I do not remember what was there.
But, on that side, where Dzershinskiy Street goes down to Marx Street

(Prospekt Marksa), there was a bar.

That there was a bar there, every dog, all the KGB employees and

all of Moscow knew.
((XG; A and B speak at the same time.))

Yes, everyone knew «= right.

But I do not remember what there was in this building.
Why did they like to go to that bar?

Because there was always crayfish and beer there,
Well, it was an interesting bar.

There were several bars in Moscow.

But this bar was’ called precisely "Bar".

It was in a basement and it had a low ceiling.

When did they change the name, “Bar'?

B. I do not remember; the name, "Bar", was changed to "Pivnoy Zal
(Beer Hall)"; "Pivnoy Zal" Number Such-and-such, "Pivnoy Zal"

Number Two,

A. Imagine -~ if you worked in the KGB in 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956,
1957, 1958, etc., then probably every day you walked on

Dzherzhinskiy Square from some side.
B, Certainly.
A, You went on Dzherzhinskiy Street from one side or another somewhere.
B. Yes.
A. You probably passed along Kuznetskiy Most' every day.
B. Yes,

°

A, I can in no way believe that you have forgotten what there was

in the place "Detskiy Mir" ((now stands)).
B. I do not remember, I do not remember,
A, Impossible.

B. I do not remember, I tell you I do not remember.
I myself can give you an example,

Anyone can become confused,

A, For what reason do you give this example?
This is another question.
We can return to this later.

Well, anyway, what about the Komsomol?

B. I told you about it absolutely accurately, the way I remember it.

So, so, so,

A. Well, what did you speak about with the Komsomol Committee Secretary

of the MVD the first time you saw him?

B, It was not only the Secretary of the Komsomol Committee who spoke

with me the first time -- it was either SOKOLOV.or KOZ'MIN, one of

these bureau members,
