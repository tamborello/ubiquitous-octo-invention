would be. honored only wpon the presertation of evidence
that the three Cuban officials died <t the hands of the
assasSins connected with Cameron's ccntacts.

6. In early April 1964 Eliseo (omez Fernandez met

with Jose "Pepin" Bosch., Bosch agreed to advance $100,000
and Babun and his associates would acvance $2,500 for .
expenses, Julio Lobo Olavarria, a wealthy Cuban exile
in New York, subsequently agreed to the terms, provided
that his name was not involved. Accurdingly, Babun gave
Cameron $2,500 on 25 April. Cameron then advised his i
group, and on 25 April he reported that his group had
already called its man in Cuba and told him to procesd
as planned and that "their other man’ would be heading
for Cuba shortly. The final comment was i'we hope to
have some good news for you between ‘}0 and 25 May."
Lobo planned to fly to Miami on 19 Muy to arrange for
the transfer of $100,000 to a safety deposit box, the
: keys to which are to be held jointly by Cameron and a
Go fieant of Lobo. /

7. The identities of the perso.is in the Cameron
group and how they plan to proceed with this mission
are not known. Babun's associates are reluctant to

- make any unnecessary querieS because they have invested
$2,500 and because Cameron made it fiirly clear at the
.beginning that the Mafia was involvei. Cameron re-
vealed during the negotiations that 11S contact was a
police officer in the St.Louis, Missouri, Vice Squad
who was about to retire and who has’ merous connections
in the Mafia. Cameron implied that ‘the other man" in
question is in Spain. Cameron knows that he could be
-indicted for conspiracy and that if there is any :
treachery on his part, Babun and his associates would
not hesitate to sink his ship, the M/V CAYMAN HOPE.

8. In late May 1964 a prominent Cuban exile who
spoke with Jose "Pepin" Bosch reported that Teofilo
Babun and Eliseo Gomez had a plan under way to assas-
Sinate Fidel Castro for the payment of $150,000. Bosch

- claimed that he had committed himSelf to furnish
$50,000 and that he waS hoping he could get the balance
