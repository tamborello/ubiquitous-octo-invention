MEMORANDUM FOR? ~ DO/TRO

FROM: , Edgar Tf. McHenry
“ Chief, Classification Review Branchy-1P&CRD

SUBJECT: | Middleton Mandatory Review Request (=92-0185)

1. This Lyndon Johnson Library request consists of
twenty-two documents from a Johnson Library file identified as
"NSF, Intelligence File, ‘Oswald, Lee Harvey, ' Box 9." The
requester, Mr. Harry J. Middleton, is Director of the Johnson
Library. The same material is also being piggybacked to
another requester, Mr. August Russo, in our case E92-0199.

2. We have made a preliminary assessment of these
documents with regard to the fact that similar documents
relating to the JFK assassination are being reviewed by the
newly restructured Historical Review Group which is under a
mandate by the DCI to assume a bias toward declassification.

3. We note the following intelligence concerns which are
evident in the Oswald material now presented for review:

Intelligence derived from foreign liaison: Found in
Document Nos. 6, 8, 9, 20, 25, 28, and 32a.

Intelligence derived from covert sources: Found in
Document Nos. 11, 13, 30, and 33a.

Intelligence derived from signals intercept (or wire tap)
programs: Found in Document Nos. 2la, 23, 24, 29, and 31.
