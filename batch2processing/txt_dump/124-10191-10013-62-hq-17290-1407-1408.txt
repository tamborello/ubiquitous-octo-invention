INTERVIEW BY HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS

On December 14, 1978, Special Agent Thomas J.
Deakin, Public Affairs Office, FBIHQ, was interviewed by
Messrs. McHargh and Webb of the House Select Committee
on Assassinations regarding the Racial Counterintelligence
Program which Special Agent Deakin supervised for a period
of time in 1967 and 1968.

The questions asked by the Committee staff
related to the justification of selecting Martin Luther
King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference as
targets of the Counterintelligence Program and at what
level of the FBI this selection was made.

General information on the method of originat-
ing and handling Counterintelligence Program suggestions
was explored, as was the particulars of the Counter-
intelligence Program aimed at the Poor Peoples Campaign.

The Committee investigators were particularly
interested in the amount of counterintelligence sugges-
tions generated by former Assistant Director W. C, Sullivan
and whether these were on his own initiative or by oral
instructions from J. Edgar Hoover. This last area was, of
course, beyond the knowledge of Special Agent Deakin.

A final area of inquiry was what was described
by the Committee investigators as factionalism within
Bureau Headquarters between C. D. LeLoch and W. C. Sullivan.

This interview was not under oath as Mr. Webb
explained the Committee only planned to take a deposi-
tion if new information was obtained from Special
Agent Deakin.

in the FBI ever did consider such a step.

The Chairman. Were you shocked and amazed that it was
testified to here that when Mr. Rose heard Dr. King had been
killed he expressed joy, and used the term ''They got the
SOB''? Did that shock and amaze you?

Mr. Brennan. That shocked me, yes. t don't see how any
man, particularly the men of the caliber, of the type that
we try to get into the FBI, would be joyful over that type
of assassination.

The Chairman. Regrettably, Mr. Rese is still with the
FBI.

Mx. Brennan. Well, sir, that is not of my doing.

The Chairman. I do not fault you for that. I fault the
system for Keeping him.

The gentleman from the District of Columbia, Mr. Fauntroy.
Mr. Fauntroy. Nr. Chairman, I have no questions. I am
exhausted.

The Chairman. The gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Dévine.
