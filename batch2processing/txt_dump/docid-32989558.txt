My initial view is that the Senate Select Committee shouid

‘that the House Select Committee was given in response to its»ce-

cuest. I would oppose giving the Senate Select Conmittee access!
to the unexc’sed version of these documents for security reasons.

With seyard to the November 21 letter referenced in John

cnexcised versions of the documents but would prefer that the
Senate Select Committee be given delivery of excised versions
only. Elliff's letcer appears to accept this arrangement.

 

With regard to the request for materials concerning aay
surreptitious entries, the Senate Select Committee is referring
to what was described as a surreptitious entry not related to a
saicrophone surveillance in 1972 against an "Arab Terroris. Acti
vist". This surreptitious entry was listed on an FBI memorandun
dated November 5, 1975 which was in response to a request rrom
