6. Possible Interest in the Shrimp’ Industry

Captain NESTOR advised in January, 1953, that
-he had heard a comment from some source he cannot ;
remember, that the old Capone mob was attempting to get
a. corner in the shrimp industry of the United States.
NESTOR advised that an informant, whose identity he did
not wish to disclose, advised him that his information
was that TONY ACCARDO and. SAM GIANCANA weré active in
the mob's attempts to muscle in on the shnimp industry.

Ze Possible Ownership of Real Estate

T8. advised on January.18, 1955, that NATALE
PASSARO, Jr. had recently indicated that he was attempt-
ing to secure mortgages on the following properties:

_ 1331 Indiana Avenue, a 7 apartment building,

mortgage ‘desired $35,000,003 :
2111 South Homan Avenue, a two flat building,
mortgage desired $12,000.00;

1620-22 South Harding , a 13 apartment building,
mortgage desired $5,000.00; and |

mortgage desired $13,500.00.'

T8 advised that PASSARO was being assisted by
