‘the effectiveness of the operation and te plan follow

up ection. Im the field of Politicel Action the LIFZAT
coverage of a Cuban target has been invaluable ta the
giamning and execution of « denigration operation (AMROD).

ho Station aleo uses LIFEAT to cover agents whe have been
terminated wader circumstances which we feel might lead
the particular agent to blackwail oy cooperation with the
opposition. Personality data ie algo gathered on Seviate,
Cubans and Commmiste for assesaing purposes fer possible
future recruitment. The FBI also takes advantage of our
unilateral capability, aad we cover selected American
Communists gor then,

4, LEPEAT alse produces goue positive intelligence. .
Buring the period 1 duly 1964 te 21 dume 1005, 26 positive

intelligence reports have been received which are partly:

or wholly attributable to ¢his project. Very many of these

. weporte are only in pert based on LIVEAT coverage, many

others consist of short messages which are mot of great
intelligence value when taken by themgolyes. Hovever, the
operation fulfills a very essential function in the intelli-
gence field by coafirming other intelligence reports made
by agente, 5M 9689 which reproduced a telephone. conversa

‘$ionm of Vieter RICO Galan had a great impact in Hoadquartere
_ @inee it pointed up an important feature of Communist policy
in the Doninieaa Republic. From the positive intelligence

point of view, one report of this calibre géé8 a ‘long vey i ~
justisy even on expousive project. -

3S. There are m) security gontrol problems. During

‘the past year when a Headquarters trainer was in Mexice on

another case, the Station toevk advantage of hia presence

to give dustruction to WILSTED in clandestine communicatisne, -
_ operations! security, and reporting. Taree agente under this

project were given LOPLUTTER examinatione Inet year, When
WILSEED comes to Headquarters during hie bons “onve thic

eeming year, he alga will be given an LOPLUTE.

G. The operational reporting on this project has been
geod. Quarterly progress reports have been received on both
Project LIPEAT and Project LINGG. The latest reports covered

the period through March 1986. _

7. WH Division supports the Mexice City Station's

‘vequest for renewal of the LIPEAT Project. In view of the

importance and variety of the CE fargete in Mexico, the -
common border betweem Mexico and the United States, and the
resulting security considerations, it is believed imperative
that EUBARK have access to a unilateral technical surveillance

capability such as that provided under LITEAT.
