{. IN RESPONSE REF A QUESTION, AVAILABILITY IS MAIN
FEATURE, BUT EASE IN ADMINISTRATION AND SECURITY ARE ALSO
FACTORS INFLUENCING OUR PROPOSAL TO COMBINE PHOTO OPERATION
WITH KDVAULT TECHNICAL OPERATION. APARTMENT UNDER EARLIER
CONSIDERATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL PROBABLY SOMETIME
IN MAY, AND WE DO NoT NOW HAVE ANY SUITABLE CANDIDATES TO
TAKE POSSESSION WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. COMBINING BOTH
OPERATIONS WILL REDUCE NUMBER ASSETS INVOLVED, COSTS, AGENT
MEETINGS AND PROJECT ADMIN. SECURITY WILL BE ENHANCED BECAUSE
TWO ACTIVE SITES IN SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY CKPOLAR INSTALLATION
“youLD DOUBLE COVER PROBLEMS AND DOUSLE NUMBER OF CLANDESTINE

MEETINGS TO RETRIVE PRODUCT.
