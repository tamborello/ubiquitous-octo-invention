"Hall (Haler) advised that it was his opinion from
his contacts ana knowledge of Ruby that Ruby had.

Harvey Oswald and that the only motivation that

 

he, Hall, could contribute to Ruby was money ‘or
the fear that Oswald possibly might involve Ruby

a - MEMORANDUM

 

Regarding

Testimony of Harry Haler |

 

 

Harry Haler appeared as a witness before the Sub-—

committee on the Assassination of John F. Kennedy on

 

Thursday, March 16, 1978, at which time the veracity, of his

testimony was seriously questioned by several Menbers of the -

 

Subcommittee due to certain internal inconsistencies in his
_ presentation and specific variances with ‘a “previous “statément |
given to Federal agents on November 30, 1963 at the Terminal
“Island Federal ‘Institution, Los Angeles, california. °

This memorandum contains several gross examples” ~

illustrating the problems inherent in accepting Haler's

 

 

testimony which the Committee Members might wish to pursue

during Haler's next appearance under oath.
