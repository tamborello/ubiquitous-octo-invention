of $199.50 had been made at another branch office in NYC but
had not been credited to the subject's account. As a result,
the check made out in May, 1961, for rent for the apartment at
110 Christopher Street, NYC, was not honored inasmuch as there
were insufficient funds to cover this rent. Mr. STRINING said
that he called a telephone number in NYC, the exact number he

. is. unable to recall at the present time, in connection with this
matter. Mr. STRINING said he spoke to an unknown female who ,
answered his phone call, and this unknown female advised him !
that "RICHARD FRANK and his wife are in Red China, don't you — . i
know that?". Mr. STRINING was unable to recall this number
but will endeavor to locate the original deposit of $199.50 to
getermine if there is any clue there as to the phone number he
called.
