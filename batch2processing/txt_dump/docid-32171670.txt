The rally was opened with a prayer by O'PRY. There.
were three speakers and three crosses were burmdi..

The first to speak was O'PRY and he said the klan
needed everyone to hdip with the fight to keep Negroes
from mixing with the white children and mixing of all kinds.
He told of chasing a Negro from a store near his home until
he (O'PRY) was through buying his groceries. He challenged
any preacher to face him and tell him it is God's will to
integrate. O'PRY introduced FNU NOUCE as the next: speaker.

: NOUCE ‘has spoken at several klan rallies,and he said
he understands the way the Southern people feel about mixing.

There was not much said about the death of JACK :
™ KENNEDY, but it was said the klan was not to run him down,
but his stands on integration would be talked about.

JASON KERSEY. told the group the United Florida Ku
Klux Klan is a part of the real klans and is not an outlaw
