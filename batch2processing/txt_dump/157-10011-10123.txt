possible that WILEY then might seck to also garner the $4,000, 00
terminal bonus first offered him.

14, Itis the writer's belief that WILEY's reluctance to accept
the previously offered termination bonus is primarily motivated by
his desixe to obtain as favorable a settlement as he can possible
maneuver out of the Agency, and, while he fully understands that
revelation of his past relationship with the Agency could be a source
of some embarrassment and concern, he does not have any intention
or desire to make any public disclosure of same, The writer cannot
assess what WILEY's mood and reaction will be, if at some time in
the future, it becomes patently evident to him that the Agency has
surfaced him to Congressional Committees. It is suggested that an
offer of some figure between $7,000.00 to $10,000. 00 could be nego-
tiated for a total final release of all claims by WILEY at the present
time, He could also be advised that no claim will be made by this
Office for any of the office equipment, fixtures, library materials,
and photo equipment which he may have and to which there may bea

have altered his plans, to comply with Office considerations, On

an Official Routing Slip in July 1971, C/SRS noted "WILEY has
established a certain image as part of his cover which makes his
participation in these things almost mandatory, In other words

he can't be a ‘little bit pregnant'.'"" The foregoing was in refer-
ence to some of WILEY's stateside activities but is believed repre-
sentative of the Office attitude. As to the fund balances and deficits,
jt seems highly unlikely that had WILEY shown a large plus final
balance, that this Office would have given any consideration as to
whether we had either a legal or moral claim to such a balance but
would have deemed the balance to be rightfully WILEY's.
Budget and Fiscal Branch, Office of Security has indicated
that such is his opinion,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12, The same reasoning as stated above applies to any Office
moral obligation to reimburse WILEY for his alleged deficit "SAROYAN"
fund balance. Itis believed, but this is conjectural, that WILEY does
not really believe that he is entitled to such a payment but merely
hopes that this claim has enough reason and stature to give him more
levers to toward » permer termination setiiemeat lie hae rally
2) acknowledged that he probably has no legal claim, It is believed

that, despite the fairly substantial size of the alleged deficit in recent
years, at no time did WILEY prior to the termination discussicrs,
request that the Office provide funds to eliminate the deficit nor did
he even inquire as to the feasibility of such an action, An added
factor, however, which may have some significance is that, although
these "S" fund accountings have been received annually, there does
not seem to have been any direct comment to WILEY regarding either
their character or the plus and minus balances he has shown therein.

 

13. Consideration must be given to the actual or apparent
‘significance of tendering WILEY any amount which is or would seem
to be, in response to his alleged claim, Should an amount closely
approximating his claimed deficit be offered WILEY, unless it were
carefully delineated in writing to be other than restitution for the
alleged 'S" fund deficit and so acknowledged by WILEY that it repre-
sented a termination bonus and that he had no other claims against
the Agency, the Agency might be placed in the position of secming
to have honored his claim. This would be unwise in that it might at

aa Waepenten) that the Agency had willfully supported some of those
RECE pidépendent}y/ dertaken domestic activities and overseas trips that

income was shown. Nor was there any way of ascertaining whether
or not he made any genuine effort to produce “outside't income, An
Office memorandum in June 1967 states that WILEY said his wife
told him that he could make a million dollars in public relations work
if he promoted something in which he was really interested. Also,
that WILEY said that that was true because he had not had his heart
in his recent work for us and, now, he plans to start selling America.
It is believed that much of his time since 1967 was expended in
domestic activities of the nature of those being generated by or
actively supported by the National Committee For Responsible
Patriotism (NCRP), of which WILEY has been the prime mover. It
ig understood that for at least some of his work with NCRP, he drew
remuacration. This does not appear in the "S$" fund income (WILEY
has stated that he didn't feel that we would consider it appropriate
for him to include it therein) and it is impossible for this office to
ascertain whether he included it on his federal income tax returns
as he just shows a gross income figure on his Schedule C. WILEY
was specifically advised on at least one occasion, by letter on 27
January 1964, that his taxable incorne should jnclude ali checks

te ged

 

yoectved from ERS /Os, a2 well os his
@ return must include all outside income. We have no knowledge
whatscever relative to any income tax return accounting at other
than the federal level. On those occasions where overseas travel
was involved after 1965, while WILEY was not denied permission
i to travel, he was told that financing would be his own problem. It
: should be noted that overseas trips have resulted in expenses being
charged to the "S" fund, In most cases, the trips were followed by
articles in the media and he has continued to give lectures through
the years, obviously drawing on these trips for background. Income
was generated, therefore, from his travels put it would be well-nigh
impossible to render a valid cost- accounting on any specific trip to
determine whether it ultimately resulted in an expense.

 
 

- and in addition the

vl ll. Itis believed that WILEY has no "paper" which would

: reflect that this Office has any legal obligation to reimburse him for
aa the deficit he now shows jn his Final SAROYAN Fund accounting, nor
does there appear to be any such paper in office records, As an in-
dependent contractor, he has been almost completely free of control
by this Office. He has on 2 aumber of occasions indicated in advances,
§ fn ndertakings that he contemplated such as overseas trips. It
must be conceded that had this Office made strong objection, he would

independent researcher, writer, lecturer, etc. This obviously
svould and did generate income, In order to build his natural
cover and increase his capability and potential value to the Office,
jin the carly years overseas travel was not only permitted but was
encouraged. Separate travel allowances were authorized and in
several instances advances were given to enable WILEY to under-
take the trips. No advance for overseas travel nor any separate
travel vouchers were approved and paid by the Finance Division
after 1964. He either secured separate funding from other out-
side sources, including foreign governments, for at least part of
his expenses or covered them himself and charged all or part of
the expense off against his outside income as reported in his "S"
fund accountings.

5, The first rendition of an '"'S' fund was for the period,
12/59-6/60 and it indicates he had had no prior outside income.
It should be noted that this pre-dates establishment of his firm,
World News Analysis (WNA). WWNA, when established in January
1961, supplied WILEY only a portion of his cover, In addition to
this lasgely nominal nows service, he onerated as a lecturer, photo-
grapher, writer, and in the years aiver 1g66, es am organiser ane
oO public relations promoter, also.

 

 

6. From October 1959 to February 1964, travel vouchers
were submitted to this Office, authorized, and payment made in
cash to an SRS representative for transmittal to WILEY. These
vouchers covered primarily stateside travel, phones, operational
lunches, etc. In June 1964, the system was changed to enable
direct payment into WILEY's New York bank account and the first
such payment made covered his travel voucher for the period, 2/1-
5/30, 1964.

7. No "S" fund accounting was rendered for the fiscal

years 7/62-6/63 and 7/63-6/64; however, commencing with the
calendar year 1964, annual calendar year accountings were re-
ceived, In April 1965, a travel voucher for the period 7/1-11/15,
1964 was received. After some discussion about its merits be-
tween E. MENDOZA and C/SRS, WILEY was told to take reimburse-
ment from the 'S" fund. Apparently WILEY had no advance warning
that this change was to occur. After some further discussion and
“hold-up Pf his travel vouchers for the first six months in 1965, they

SEP 29 1975

 

 

HW 50955 DBocld:32203891 Page 5
 

 

 

were all approved by nd paid by Finance Division

to WILEY's bank account, Subsequent to June 1965, all expenses
incurred, and/or claimed by WILEY, domestic and overseas, have
been charged against the '"'S'' fund income and no separate reimburse-~
ments have been made from Agency funds. The records reflect,
however, an intention that WILEY would submit these expense claims
frequently and regularly for approval. By 1967 this had disintegrated
into merely an annual return and WILEY's figures were-not seriously
questioned. The rationale would seem to have been that he was going
through an exercise which involved pretty much an accounting for
his own income and expenditures,

8, The figures utilized herein were necessarily essentially
supplied by WILEY, either in receipts, vouchers or reports. There
is and was apparently little opportunity for either pre-expenditure or
post- expenditure confirmation or approval of most expenses listed.
WILEY had a natural cover and worked under uncontrolled conditions
in an area remote from Agency Headquarters. This was particularly
true after 1966 when he submitted only annual accountings, While the

= then, and thers

 

 

avnendinres may have actualiv Ugeu made, there £ i
o is even less now, little reel possibility to determine the reason tor

the expenditures.and for whose benefit they were undertaken, It would
seem that his figures were accepted and deemed to be part of his
general activities and therefore part and parcel of his natural cover,
Some could have been purely personal and non-business related in any
sense, but to assume this is to question WILEY's honesty.

9. WILEY's income tax returns were as sumed to be, hopefully,
honest and reasonably accurate. His federal return (Form 1040)
Schedule C-Profit or Loss From Business ot Profession (Sole Pro-
prietorship) generally reflects his business activity to be "Writer,
Photographer, Broadcaster, Lecturer, '' No business name is listed.
His business address is his home. In 1967 and earlier he also in-
cluded "Research" as an activity and showed the business name to be
his own name,

10. As his charges as expenses were left largely to his own
discretion, so was his rendering of his “income' necessarily accepted
at face value. There is and was little possibility to audit or check

i these figures. Various receipts and papers were submitted to support
Chi ¥ imanyy Pi fp se listed but there is and was no way to confirm whether all

MEMORANDUM TO: Chief, RB/CD

 

 

SUBJECT : WILEY, Charles W.
#343 589

REFERENCE : Director of Security Memorandum for the
Record, dated 12 April 1974 on the same
Subject,

l. Referenced memorandum concerns the termination pro-
ceedings relating to Subject and to his apparent claim for reimburse-
ment for an alleged deficit of $7,475. 01 in the so-called 'SAROYAN"
(or "S') Fund, The Director's memorandum indicated that a review
of the "S" fund will be undertaken in an effort to determine the
validity of WILEY's claim so that prover consideration may be given

 

tO Lbs Gan position.

i 2. Instant memorandum attempts to relate some of the sig-
nificant factors which should be considered in arriving at an appro-
priate decision in this matter, Attached hereto are certain research
papers for reference in conjunction with this commentary, A recom-
mendation is contained in the final paragraph herein.

3. WILEY is a Contract Agent of the Office of Security and
functions under the terms of a contract, which has several amend-
ments relating to salary only, effective ] July 1959. Review of the
contract discloses it to be essentially the standard form for a Contract
Agent, Nowhere does it specifically refer to or even contemplate *
the utilization of such a financial accounting device as a 'SAROYAN"
fund. "Chester E, SAROYAN' is the pseudonym furnished by the
Agency Pseudonym Register for use in the covert handling of WILEY's
records, The contract preamble states that the U.S. Government
contracts with WILEY as an independent contractor for the submission
of certain information and related services of a confidential nature.
In the paragraph on Status, WILEY is advised that he is not an
emplo: oe the U.S. Government under this agreement and is not
entitled.te any benefits normally incident to an employee status. In

é addition to his basic compensation he was to receive 5% additional

salary in licu of insurance, retirement, medical and health pro-
grams, etc. Regarding Travel, the contract states that WILEY
will be advanced or reimbursed funds for necessary expenses incur-
red in connection with such operational travel as may be directed

or authorized by the Government, This may include per diem in
lieu of subsistente in the course of such travel and while on tempor-
ary duty away from New York, N.Y. Payment and accounting for
such expenses will be in substantial conformance with applicable
Government regulations, As to Operational Expenses, it states

that WILEY will be advanced or reimbursed funds for neces sary
operational expenses as specifically approved and financially
limited by the Government. Such funds will be subject to payment
and accounting in substantial conformance with applicable Govern-
ment regulations. A standard paragraph on Offset reflects that if
WILEY should receive any financial emoluments required under the
terms of this agreement from or through a cover facility, such
emoluments will be used to offset those due WILEY under this agree-
ment by the Government, Such emoluments thus received from or

through « aciiity onal ledged and agreed to be

by the Government within the provisions of this contract. It is the

@ . opinion of this writer that this proviso does not refer to the type of

“ activity engaged in by WILEY whercin he operated independently and

not for a cover firm. It could not be reasonably maintained that it
was the intention of the Office that his income for the last thirteen
years was to be limited to the maximum of his salary. Another
standard paragraph covers Unauthorized Commitments and states
that no promises or commitments pertaining to rights, privileges
or benefits other than those expressly stipulated in writing in this
agreement or any amendment thereto shall be binding on the Govern-
ment,

 

4, The aforementioned contract is broad enough and flexible
‘enough to permit the payment of such expense claims as WILEY sub-
mitted and were approved and authorized by this Office. It is some-
what difficult to trace the evolution of the "S' fund through its various
stages. There does not appear to have ever been any firm set of
instructions established and/or conveyed to WILEY--certainly not in
written form, The fund's handling changed through the years as did
WILEY's activities and his headquarters handlers. it was intended,
pndiseys sulted, that WILEY would establish his own cover as an
