The source stated that ROMERO requested that he

order that he could cbhtain these documents and initiate
this plan, Although the source agreed to do so, he sube
sequently left for Cuba within a few days without ROMERO
and returned to Miami in mid-December, 1967. During a
later contact with ROMERO, the source explained to him
that he had not taken him because ROMERO was on parole
and the ies (8 feared he might get into trouble with the

authorities. (4/) Rina)

The source further advised that in general
conversation with one MANUEL CHAMISO, 435 Southwest 4th

The source met EPIFANIO ROMERO DEIGADO, also known
as “Pichi” Romero, and another Cuban refugee im Miami, in
about 1962 or 1963 and has maintained infrequent contact
with him since that time, ROMERO is from Candelaria,

Pinar del Rio Province, Cuba, and is married to HILDA,
last dame unknown, whe still resides in Cuba, The source
described EPIFANIO as a person of little education who has
a strong aversion to any type of work and constantly smokes
cigars and “plays the big shot.’ ROMERO is a white male
Cuban, age about 33, 5'8", 160 pounds, thick black hair,
dark eyes, and round face, He drives a 1964 Ford Mustang
automobile. He resides at the apartment of ADOLFO BORGES
GALINDO, 1050 Northwest First Street, Miami, another Cuban
refugee and close friend of ROMERO. Also residing in this
apartment are the mother and sister of BORGES,

EPIFANIO ROMERO is not employed at the present
time but was recently employed at a doll factory in Miami.
He is on parole, having been recently released after having
served three months of a fifteen-month sentence for Assault
Upon a Federal Officer. This incident occurred in about
February, 1967, when ROMERO was involved with others in a
shooting incident with United States Customs off the
Florida coast, The incident occurred during the last of
a number of unauthorized boat trips to Cuba by ROMERO over : |
the past few years.’ It is the source's understanding that -
one of the conditions of ROVERO'’s parole is that he not
again attempt to travel to Cuba by boat. i

The source had planned a clandestine boat tris
to Cuba in November, 1967, in order to attempt to rescue .
a fryend of bis in hiding in Ravana. This friend is JOSE
LDL SCORN EL, JACINTO, also known as “Piquili,” @ Cuban
refugee who had been fercepted by the Cubans during a
clandestine trip to Cuba and who has been in hiding since
early 1967, The source was unsuccessful in his attempt
to rescue FORNELL. ;

Due to the allegations concerning the importing
of narcotics by subject, close liaison has also been main=
tained with U. S. Customs, Miami. It is noted that U. S.
Customs has a parallel case on subject concerning his
narcotics activities.

In evaluating information developed to date
in this matter, it is apparent subject has not furnished
complete informatio onceyging his contacts with the
Cuban Intelligence SE vicgplyring interview with subject.
It would appear Miami has ee courses of action open at
this junction, as follows:

1. Advise the Federal Parole Board of subject's
travel out of state under a false name, which travel can
be attested to by FBI Agents, for purpose of having sub-
ject's parole revoked. .

 

. 2. Reinterview subject and confront: him with
the fact that we are aware of his pla nd his pastcon-
tacts with Cuban Intelligence Servic well as his
deception during previous interview; [attempt to double

3. ‘Continue contacts with the,subject under |

be followed in this matter and solicits Bureau's opinion aa
