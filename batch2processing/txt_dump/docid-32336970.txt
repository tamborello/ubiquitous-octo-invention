Sierra Escambray fighting with the rebels. He
confessed that there are more than 250 well-armed
rebels fighting in the Sierra Escambray. The
IA rebels operate in groups of ten men each, using
guerrilla warfare tactics. They fight by day and
rest by night, when they await reports from their
if confidential agents in the nearby towns...

  
 
 
 

 

Field Comments:

    

aw

“ 1. A fairly reliable source reported on 25 June 1958
that a rebel force in the Sierra Escambray was successfully
employing guerrilla tactics against a much larger con- ;

G “tingent of the Cuban Armed Forces, and, at the same time;
_ winning the sympathy of the natives in that area.

 

2. The source of Field Comment No. 1 above also
reported the presence of an American war veteran

among the rebels. One William Alexander)\Morgan was
identified in the 8 April and 17 May 1958 issues of
Diario de las Americas, Miami Spanish-language,
newspaper, as a rebel leader in the area. Morgan

or Wetzler may possibly be identical with the American
rebel leader of this and/or the above-mentioned report...
