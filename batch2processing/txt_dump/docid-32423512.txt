action as adequate, we han end, the report right there on

2 The Chairman. The Committee will come to order.
3 Our purpose this morning is to commence the consideration

4 of the findings and recommendations on -the foreign and military
5 intelligence aspects of the investigation.

6 ‘Knowing that members have read the Subcommittee’ s report,

7 I suggest that we commence by simply asking if any Senator has

8 any suggestions or amendment to propose to the general

9 findings and conclusions which begin on page l and extend throu tr

12 remark?

13° “The Chairman. Yes, of course.

14 Senator Baker. I think that the Subcommittee has done a
15 good job. .There are a number of points that I would like to
16 discuss. I think none of my concerns are irreconcilable. I
WW think some of them are even as small as matters of language,
18 but there is one that I -have already mentioned to Mr. Miller
1 . and I do feel strong about, and that is if we are going to

20 . submit the. set of recommendations to the agencies, particularly):
21 the CIA in this situation, that we do it before we take

22 Committee action. .
23 I am perfectly willing for that to be done as quickly and
24 even as informally as possible, and Bill Miller suggests that
25 he might be able to meet: with Rogovin.yet today and have some

5 Mr. Chairman, is that if there is going to be an Agency -input,.
5 that they have it, because Iam called on to make any approval .|
4 80 with that understanding, I am prepared to go ahead.
5. The Chairman, All actions of the Committee will be taken
6 tentatively. I have discussed your proposal with Bill Miller
, and he will take up these recommendations informally. He will
8 make a report back of the Committee's views -- of the agency's
9 views or objections to any particular recommendations, so the
10 Committee can then consider that at the end of the road before
aa final vote and approval is taken. .

13 or just simply try to establish a verbal. consensus, because
be I_- would be -- I would not like to vote on the particular sectio s
