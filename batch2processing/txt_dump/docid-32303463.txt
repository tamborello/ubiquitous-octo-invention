- and. ALFRED IEZZI.met on January 8, 1963, at which time they
discussed "LULU." IEZZI described’ "LULU" as having a character
that is not above reproach. He explained this by advising
BRUNO that when "LULU's" brother was arrested and sent to
jail the brother had a girl friend in New Jersey. While the
brother was in jail, "LULU" visited the girl and eventually

married her. IEBZZI felt this course of conduct was not morally 4°

right and that "LULU" betrayed his brother by marrying his

girl friend. IEZZI pointed out that "LULU" is a "good hustler"
and he gets his share of numbers and race bets. IEZZI assured
BRUNO he did not tell anyone else this information about
"LULU": however, BRUNO advised IEZZI that others had already
toid him.

This is a. joint report of SAs DAVID W, BREEN, J.
’ ROBERT (PEARCE 5 JOSEPH A, VERICA and ROBERT W. HOLMES,

 
 

 

This report covers the activities of BRUNO from
1/1/63 to 6/15/63. The period is extended to give a compre-
hensive picture of BRUNO's enterprises. This is a continuing
investigation.

‘Sicilian passages in information received from PH
591-C* on 5/20/63 were translated by SA DONALD J. O'CONNOR,
Philadelphia Division, and SA PETER C, CLEMENTE and translator
SALVATORE J, FERRANTE, both of the New York Division.

te is to be noted that in connection with BRUNO's
recent trip to Italy and the investigation of his visit by
the Italian National Police, the Legat Rome advised that- .
BRUNO is carried in the records of the Italian National Police
as ANTONINO ANGELO ANNALORO.” The investigation of Immigration
and Naturalization Service, Philadelphia, of ANGELO BRUNO in
the past, as well as investigation in Philadelphia, has not
recorded a name ANTONINO ANGELO ANNALORO. In the absence of
the same being supported by any records, a title change is
not being made at this time.

The following information is included in the adminis-
trative section because of its sensitive nature:

T-1 on 1/2/63 advised that FRANK TANNARELLA at
Penn Jersey Vending, Inc., on this date gave RALPH SCHWARTZ
$2,500 which he was to give to ANGELO BRUNO for IANNARELLA.
This: represented the amount of money IANNARELLA had collected
for BRUNO in BRUNO's illegal. operation, either numbers or
loan sharking. BRUNO at a later hour that date gave FRANK
MONTE and RAYMOND MARTORANO part of the $2,500 to take to the
bank to exchange the smaller denominations to $100 denominations.

This same source on 2/8/63 reported that BRUNO gave
RALPH SCHWARTZ $2,000 in $20.00 bills, directing him to take

the afternoon on the same date BRUNO gave him an additional
‘$2,000 in $20.00 bills which SCHWARTZ had taken to the bank
at Seventh and Porter Streets, Philadelphia, and exchanged
them for $100 bills. Again on 2/11/63 BRUNO gave SCHWARTZ

' $3,000 in small bills, $5.00s, $10.00s, and $20.00s, which

on the same date and was told by IANNARELLA to return the
following day to pick up ‘an additional $1,000.in small bills
to do likewise. It was interesting to note on this date

that IANNARELLA told SCHWARTZ that his wife was sick and. that
she could not sleép on the evening of 2/25/63, so IANNARELLA
counted his money which amounted to $3,000 in $1.00. bills
which he placed in packages of $100. The source stated this
money was accrued from either BRUNO's numbers or loan sharking
activities. The source also indicated that this was the

money at his residence, third floor. This residence is owned
by IANNARELLA's mother and IANNARELLA has an apartment on the
