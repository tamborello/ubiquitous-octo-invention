: According to SHERIDAN, WEINHEIMER was a ringleader
of a group of “gypsy chasers," whose activities were
temporarily stopped when they were indicted on federal anti-
trust and antl-racketeering charges and were found guilty in
District Court. He said the conviction was reversed by the
Court of Appeals and the ‘Peversal. was upheld by the ‘Supreme
Court.

SHERIDAN advised that WEINHEIMER was considered a
trouble maker: by - ‘truck owners and an individual who was always
looking to’ make a "soft buck” in any way he could. SHERIDAN
described WEINHEIMER as one who- worked as an individual, . as
opposed to one. who was part of a group. He said that in‘his
opinion WEINHEIMER could be described as an individual - labor
racketeer ‘who would readily make payoffs to union officials
in order to gain. benefits: for a company which engaged his
services. SHERIDAN said he could not cite any instances —
which would involve WEINHEIMER in labor racketeering | matters"
but his connection with Exhibitors Service Company and. ~ ;
‘GEORGE. CALLAHAN, JR., appeared to him to fall within that.
category because of WEINHEIMER 's background.

SHERIDAN advised that on May 10, 1957, WEINHEIMER
introduced CALLAHAN to him in the offices of the’ Authority.
According to SHERIDAN, both WEINHEIMER and CALLAHAN ‘iridicated
to him, by their statemerits and ‘actions, that. ‘WEINHEIMER was
‘representing, Exhibitors Service Company as a labor ‘manager or
consultant.

SHERIDAN said that WEINHEIMER told him that CALLAHAN
was having certain difficulties with IBT locals covering his
area in McKées Rocks, Penhsylvania, and asked SHERIDAN if he
would help to straighten out the matter. According to SHERIDAN,
WEINHEIMER and CALLAHAN told him that Exhibitors Service .
Company was primarily engaged in transporting film and had a
labor contract with one IBT local covering this operation.
However, CALLAHAN said he eould not load general freight. on |
his trucks, using the union personnel who loaded film, but >
was being required to engage loaders fromanother T local :
to handle the general freight. WEINHEIMER and. CALLAHAN i

to handle film and general freight and asked SHERIDAN if he

| could. help them with the unions.

i SHERIDAN said he told WEINHEIMER and CALLAHAN he

: would see, what he could do for them, but he said he had no

; use for WEINHEIMER and he therefore had no intention of doing

' anything for. CALLAHAN and he did nothing whatsoever in their

pehalf,

fd SHERIDAN ‘said he believed that WEINHEIMER. brought

ca CALLAHAN to see him to impress CALLAHAN and he believed that

WEINHEIMER had sold himself to CALLAHAN on the basis of his

\ connections in the labor uniémfield. According to SHERIDAN,

| WEINHEIMER had never contacted him before this meeting with
' CALLAHAN and he has not done so since. °

; ‘SHERIDAN said he has no information concerning the :
activities. of WEINHEIMER over the past several years and he 7,
was surprised to see WEINHEIMER cast in the roll of a labor
manager or consultant. SHERIDAN stated that in his opinion, i
WEINHEIMER did not have a sufficient background in the .
labor-management relations field to qualify himself for his
alleged position with CALLAHAN ter to deal with labor matters on .
a legitimate basis. He added that it was also his opinion +
that any benefits or favorable settlements WEINHEIMER  . .

\ effected for CALLAHAN, would in most instances be. gained

through the medium of payoffs to union officials but he could

not substantiate this opinion by citing actual andidents ;

Dare 12/22/58

' HUGH SHERIDAN, Chairman of the New York City Trucking
Authority (Authority), 141 Broadway, New York City, residence ~
72-48 June. Street, Forest Hills, New York, stated that the
New York City Trucking Authority is an organization which was
voluntarily formed by truck operators and unions in the truck-
ing fiéld lecated in’ the New York Metropolitan area. The
funetion of the Authority is to straighten out difficulties
between the: truckers. and the various unions and to assist
them in negotiating labor contracts. SHERIDAN said the cost
of operating the Authority is borne, two-thirds by the truckers, |
and one-third by the unions: He added that the principal union
in the Authority is Local 807, International Brotherhood of
Teamsters .(IBT).. a oo

 

SHERIDAN advised he has known EDWARD WEINHEIMER for” °°. °
approximately 30 years, He sid WEINHEIMER was a member , but ~
never an officer; of Local 8075. IBT, SHERIDAN stated that.
prior to. his. becoming: chairman of. the Authority, and when: he
was operating his own trucking business, WEINHEIMER first came
to his attention as a "gypsy chaser," ‘SHERIDAN said a "eypsy:
chaser" is a term used in trucking circles to deseribe a union
I loadér: (unleader) or driver who jumps up on a rig entering ;
f the city.and tells the driver that he will be his helper for the
day for a day's pay. ‘The driver is told at the ‘time - that he
will not be able to unload unless he has a, union man- aboard.

 

SHERIDAN stated that it was the practice of the "gypsy
' chasers" to demand their pay before allowing the drivers’ to

unload and then to disappear after the driver's first unloading .
stop... They then returned to the outskirts of the city and

repeated the operation with other drivers. In thé. case of - ~
WEINHEIMER, he would do this three and sometimes four times in |
a day.
