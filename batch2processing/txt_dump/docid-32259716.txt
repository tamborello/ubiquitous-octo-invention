3. #105-106995-19
April 15, 1963
Report to Director from SAC, Miami
Subject: Agrupacion Montecristi (AM)

AM is part of Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) a union
of anti-Castro organizations. The CRC receives money
from the CIA and then it is distributed to member
organizations to maintain various groups and engage in
anti-Castro activities inside Cuba. The CIA had an
operational interest in Leslie and George Nobregas, but
it was ended in 1962 after they engaged in an "outlaw"
shelling raid on a suburb of Havana.

Nobregas said it was his personal opinion that if the —

U.S. plans to co-exist with Cuba, the AM will leave the
CRC and operate independently to overthrow Castro.
