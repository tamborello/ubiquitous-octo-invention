@ HARVEY:

. HARVEY confirmed the accuracy of the I.G. REPORT version of his —

 

initial discussion of Executive Action with BISSELL. (36-37; 6/25)
HARVEY testified that his "net impression" from the discussion with

BISSELL was that both Executive Action and the ongoing poison pill

 

assassination plot were "fully authorized and approved" (54; 6/25),
although no specific individual in the "WHITE HOUSE" was mentioned.
(81; 6/25) HARVEY said that after his initial meeting with BISSELL,
he discussed the propriety and feasibility of assassination with se-

lected CIA officers, who generally expressed a "negative reaction."

 

(40; 6/25) After a subsequent. meeting with BISSELL, HARVEY continued —

to develop the assassination capability without mounting an operation
@ or communicating the objective to any potential asset who was being

assessed. (45; 6/25)

 

Chronology. HARVEY has notes (see attachment) of two meetings to
discuss Executive Action which he is "almost certain" took place in
1961. (51; 6/25) On January 25, he met with SIDNEY GOTTLIEB, the new ¢
Chief of CIA's Technical Services Division. On the following day, he

ARWOILD SuoaNER who recruited agent QUWIN -- the only agent

is

s

HARVEY ever employed in Project ZRRIFLE (for the purpose of "spotting" |

potential assets). (50-55; 6/25) HARVEY said that these meetings took 5
place after his initial discussion of Executive Action with BISSELL, -

thus placing that meeting in "early January." (52; 6/25)
