Re Bureau airtel to Cleveland, 4/16/64,

 

Informant was contacted on 4/25/64, at which time
he was questioned as to what group he considers himself to be a
member of, and he advised he believes he became a member of the
"Calabrese Organization", which in the Youngstown area has as
its active head, DOMINICK MALLAMO and PAUL ROMEO of Campbell,
Ohio, being the retired "head." He advised that at no time durin
the initiation ceremony did ROMEO use the words "La Cosa Nostra", |
however, he did tell informant he’ was going to make him "one of.
| us." He also stated that to date, no other superiors have been
identified to him, nor has he obtained any info as to the connect
ion of this group with groups in other cities.

 

Glo-({F BBS—

It is to be recalled that ROMEO, during the initiation
ceremony, asked the informant, however, if he would be able to
travel to Steubenville and Cleveland, O., for him.

Continued contacts will be had with the informant in
an effort to resolve those questions raised in re airtel.
