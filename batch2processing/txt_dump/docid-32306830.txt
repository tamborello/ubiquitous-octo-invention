ReBuairtel to Chicago dated 12/20/68 and
Chicago letter to Bureau dated 12/31/68.

CG 6538-C-TE advised this date that DOMINIC
NUCCIO is in Miami, Florida, and has been there since
12/30/68.

NUCCIO is a long-time LCN member in Chicago
and although not believed to be of sufficient stature
to attend an LCN meeting is nonetheless in the Miami
area and may possibly be considered as a potential
attendant.
