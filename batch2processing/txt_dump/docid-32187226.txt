ReNYairtel 4-1-64 setting forth allegation of
Theodore Lee received from NY 3948-C, Allegation set forth in
reairtel is similar to allegation made by Mark Lane who is. known
to your office in testimony before the President's Commission
alleging that a week prior to the assassination of President
Kennedy a meeting took place at the Carousel Club in Dallas, Texas,
which was attended by Mr. Bernard Weissman, Dallas Police Officer
J. D. Tippat;, and Jack Ruby. Investigation has developed no
information indicating that such a meeting ever took place or that
such a meeting was ever likely.

In view of the nature and Commission's interest in above
allegation, additional efforts should be made to reinterview Lee
specifically concerning statements set forth in reairtel, While
protection of your informant should be bornein mind, if cooperative,

 

Lee should be pinned down to specifics. If uncooperative, we should

at least give him opportunity to put up or shut up in view of his
past position and influence as head of Fair Play for Cuba Committee
(FPCC).

Incorporate pertinent information set forth in reairtel
as well as results of attempt to interview Lee concerning this
matter in letterhead memorandum form suitable for dissemination to
the President's Commission,
