said inquiries are being made through British sources in |
view of his claimed prior residence in England and investi- \
gation is being conducted to establish circumstances |
surrounding his admission to Canada and in Alberta in view
of information in letter written by OSBORNE to the YMCA :
in Montreal, Quebec. (c-) -
