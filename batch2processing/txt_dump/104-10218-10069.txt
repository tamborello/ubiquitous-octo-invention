ONLY FIVE PERSONS FLEW TO CUBA IN THE DC-4 AND NO MEXICANS WERE
AMONG THEM, (SOURCR COMMENT; IT IS VERY UNUSUAL. FOR CUBANA TO
CARRY ONLY FIVE PASSENGERS ON ITS MEXICO-TO-HAVANA KUN.) WHEN
ASKED WEY HE DID NOT DO MORE IN CULTURAL PRESS WORK FOR CUBA, LOPEZ
REPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT, BUT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS
ASSISTING THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES IN MEXICO, (SOURCE COMMENT:
LOPEZ IS PROBABLY A SECURITY OR INTELLIGENCE ROPRRSENTATIVE AT

TRE CUBAN EMBASSY, SINCE HE 1S VERY CLOSE TO R1CO GALAN AND AP~
PEARED TO FEBL THAT THE MEXICANS CONNECTED WITU,THE CASE WHO HAD
NOT YET BEEN ARRESTED SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN PASSAGE TO CUBA.) :

4, ON 12 AUGUST FERNANDO RICO GALAN, VICTOR'S BROTHER, WAS
OBSERVED IN THE CUBANA OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY ATTEMPTING TO ARRANGE
FOR A FLIGHT TO HAVANA. THE FLIGHT DID NOT COKE TO MEXICO CITY
THAT DAY AND FERNANDO WAS LATER ARRESTED IN THE ROUNDUP, ALSO
ON 12 AUGUST ONE NOEL BARRA ZENIL WAS OBSERVED ATTEMPTING TO AR-
RANGE PASSAGE TO CUBA, (SOURCE COMMENT: BARRA IS A RABID coM-
MUNIST REVOLUTIONARY WHO IS CLOSE TO RICO GALAN AND UNTIL RECENTLY
WAS A LONG-TIME RESIDENT OF HAVANA.) (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: A
USUALLY RELIABLE SOURCE REPORTED THAT IN MAY 1956 ALVAR NOEL BARRA
ZENIL WAS LISTED AMONG PERSONS COHSIDERED TO BE THE MOST ACTIVE
MEMBERS OF THE PARTIDO OBRERO-CAMPESINO MEXICANO (POCM, MEXICAN
