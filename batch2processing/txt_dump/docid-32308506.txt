MM T-1, on June 20, 1963, advised that i
Roy Hargraves borrowed a station wagon, and Hemming
arranged for a Cuban national in Miami, name unknown,
to stand by and be available to drive this car to
Morino's house to take away the weapons to be stolen -/
by Hemming. Hemming also arranged for AnselmegAli EEro, Fla
Jr. to drive Hemming around in Aliegro's@af7 DML)
For this armed robbery, Hemming planned to use ;
a Russian-made "Papacha" (phonetic) machine gun. Yar)

On June 19, 1963, Hargraves, Steve Wilson,
Richard Watley and Joe Garman met Morino at the Trio
Diner at about 8:15 p.m Watley and Morino departed
from there in Morino's /automobile and went to_2954
Southwest 16th Terrace, the residence of Carlogs<Zarraga.
“Hargraves, Wilson and Garman followed a short distance
away in a station wagon. They all arrived at Zarraga' s
residence at about the same time. Hemming and Aliegro
arrived later, in Aliegro's car, and waited outside ‘
\ until Garman, from inside the house, gave the signal
that all was clear. ~- :

Then, Hemming entered the house and found 2
that Watley, Wilson, Hargraves and Garman had drawn 1
their guns on Mor ino, Zarraga, two other unidentified
Cubans, and Zarraga's wife and children. Zarraga's
first impression was that Hemming and his associates were

policemen. O(n) . |

Thereafter, Hemming and Watley brought Zarraga .
and Morino into the garage and severely threatened them,
while the other members of Hemming's group raided the
house and took out uniforms, ammunition magazines, guns
of miscellaneous types, and one complete -50 caliber

machine gun. (¥ Yar)

Hemming got in a discussion with ‘Zarraga and &
the two other Cubans, and Zarraga claimed he was selling#
the guns for Morino and had nothing to do with Morino a
personally. Hemming then had a change of heart, decided™:
to give all the guns and equipment back to Zarraga, and
then ordered his men to unload the station wagon and 4
bring all the materiel back into the house. Hemming's =: _
men then left with Morino, to go to Morino's house and iv gs
steal the weapons there. During this entire time, Morino ,
was under the guns of Hemming's men, who threatened to
shoot him if he tried to escape or obtain help. Hemming i
stayed at Zarraga's house for about another half hour,
talking about the general Cuban political situation.

made several calls to Morino's house, and was trying
to arrange an appointment to meet Morino at the Trio

MM T=1, on June 19th, 1963, advised that at ~~
9:00 a.m. on that date, Hemming and Watley met Morino
at the Trice Diner, and discussed the possibility of
Hemming's buying arms from Morino. Morino took Watley
out to his car and showed him some samples which Morino
had in the trunk of his automobile. Morino then took
Watley to a private residence at 2954 Southwest 16th,
Terrace, and showed him a 50 caliber machine gun which
was for sale. Later, Hemming and several of his associates
met Morino at Morino's residence in Hialeah, Florida,
where they planned to rob him of his arms. Immediately
thereafter, Morino's wife and children returned home
unexpectedly, so Hemming-postponed the robbery of Morino
until a later ime f (X mM)

would go to Morino's house and steal the remainder of the
arms at that location (YY )
