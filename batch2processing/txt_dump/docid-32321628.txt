Title: JFK RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992 (The Act)

 

Synopsis: Miami is requested to conduct necessary research
pursuant to the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) letter
requiring the FBI's response by 10/21/96. Miami is also
requested to send pertinent files to Headquarters/JFK Task Force
as soon as possible.

Details: The ARRB by letter dated 9/10/96 (copy available ;
upon request) has requested that the FBI identify all information
in FBI assassination records that the FBI believes is under court
seal.

The ARRB's interest in this matter, is to have the Department of
Justice assist in petitioning the courts to unseal the records so
the documents may be opened to the public as established by the
JFK Assassination Records Collection Act (JFKARCA).

In accordance with the ARRB letter, the FBI must
identify which jurisdictions/judges placed these records under
court seal. In the case of electronic surveillance, the ARRB
also seeks the location and the. duration of the surveillance.
Because the background information concerning these electronic
surveillances are maintained in the Field Office, we are
“requesting that the field do the research necessary to respond to
the ARRB's request. The ARRB seeks the following information:

 

- 1) the name and jurisdiction of the judge approving
the electronic surveillance. :
