Attached airtel advises that DeWitt Coffman

: requested Miami Office to furnish 'FBI clearance" on |
Michael McLaney who was being considered for the. posi- |
, tion of manager of a new hotel and gambling casino in
. Haiti being built by Coffman's associates. When j
, informed the FBI does not:furnish "clearances" on any-
gone and was unable to comment concerning McLaney,
Mr. Coffman stated he was a friend of Mr. Tolsonts |
and perhaps he would contact Mr. ‘Tolson for information |
4about McLaney. i

 

; Bureau files show Mr. Coffman knew the !
Director and Mr, Tolson when he was formerly employed |
, at the Mayflower, Hotel, Washington, D. C. He was also
Vice President and General Manager of Schine Hotels in

Miami, Florida, in 1958. Mr. G. David Schine, who
is on the Special Correspondents' List, at that time was °

| President and General Manager of the Schine Hotels,

McLaney, born 2-1-15 in New Orleans, Louisiana,
‘has a long reputation of being an inveterate gambler and

. associate of high-stakes bettors. He was part-owner and
| operator. of the casino in the Hotel Nacional; Havana,
Cuba, in 1959, when members of the Meyer Lansky group|
‘had an interest in it. From 6/4/65 to 3/7/67, he was an'|
' ; approved Top Echelon criminal informant and provided
: valuable information about hoodlums and gamblers. He |

: was discontinued when he became involved in political —
‘activities in the Bahamas. The Commission of Inquiry,
: Bahamas, in 1967, severely.criticized McLaney for his
} efforts to buy Premier Lynden Pindling and become head
_ of gambling ‘énterprises in the Bahamas.
