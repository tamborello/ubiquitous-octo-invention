le The ‘statement by the Texas state authorities that 't ‘the slaying of
OSWALD closes the ‘investigation of the KENNEDY assassination brought on public
reactions of doubt by some segments of the information media (commentators and
journalists) of the intentions of the Dallas police. who conducted” the “investi-
gation. This in turn facilitated the decision of. the federal authorities to
step into. the investigation immediately. Re KENNEDY' s hand can also be seen
in this. Therefore, a ‘struggle between: the Fight and groups close to KENNEDY
will continue over the political implications of the attempt. It must be .
expected that in the near future it.will’pass to more basic matters of foreign
and internal policies of the new president. Although the right was not success-
ful, so far, in obtaining a high degree of anti-communist tension in the
community, and force, in this way, JOHNSON to immediately withdraw from
KENNEDY's line, undoubtedly the reaction expanded its influences. Its repre-
sentatives in Congress, HICKENLOOPER . for example, began an open.attack against
KENNEDY's policy of seekirig agreements with the Soviet Union, emphasizing with
this the hope that VODSEN will not be such an “inexperienced” politician.

2e In the WN great importance is attached to JOHNSON's ‘talks with”
MIKOYAN, DE GAULLE and ERHARD (the level and. number of the FRG delegation
attached special attention). The Western delegations of. . Europeans and Scandi-
navians, with whom we talked, avoided any speculation whatsoever as to the
result of the talks. “ '
