LA 92-1112
- ADMINISTRATIVE

. On 8/4/67, LA 4LYS- C-TE advised that with the oo ,
death of ‘os Angeles LCN "Boss" FRANK DESIMONE on that date,
that "Under-Boss* NICK LICATA would be in charge of the Los
Angeles LON "Brugada". Informant stated that LICATA will
remain in charge until a new "Boss" is selected.

; “Informant=stated that, almost invarible, a "Capo"
is selected to be the new "Boss". While this is not always
true, it is, generally, the practice. Informant stated that
an "Under-Boss" is seldom selected to replace a "Boss",
Informant stated that this is true because a "Capo" is more
powerful than the "Under-Boss" as a "Capo" is at the operational

- level of the organization and the "members" are assigned

. Girectly to him. An "Under+Boss" has no "members" assigned
directly to him. . a .

This is one of “the reasons why informant does not,
presently, feel that "Under~Boss" NICK LICATA will be selected
_as the new "Boss". In addition, informant noted the resentment

: of various LCN "members" towards LICATA’ because of his lack of
_ positive and productive leadership.

Informant stated that he was certain that LICATA .
would atkempt to line up support in a bid to name him (LICATA) —
as "Boss". Another candidate would be "Capo" JOSEPH DIPPOLITO..
Informant “noted that it was yet too early to know what direction
the various bids for: power within the Los Angeles "Brugada" oe
would take.

Informant stated on 8/4/67 that a ngw "Bdss" would
be selected by a vote of each LCN member" of the "Brugada".

~ Informant noted, however, that this was far from being as.

- democratic as -it sounded. Generally, he noted, the ranking
‘and more powerful "members" of the "Brugada" agree among
themselves who will be "Boss". ‘The "Capos" ; in turn,

contact their "Members" for their approval. "Members"
generally vote as a- block for the man their "Capo" is backing.

Informant noted, at this point, that the key man
in the selection of the new "Boss" would, in informant's:
opinion, ‘be JOHN ROSELLI. Informant stated that ROSELLI, . ot
undoubtddly, would be connacted and consulted relative to his

views and his choice as "Boss". Informant felt that the opinion
* of ROSELLI would be persuasive | on the Los Angeles "members".
