trial in Rockwall, Texas, on felony charges of operating
a gambling house, was found guilty by a jury. and received
a two year suspended sentence. BIRCH was the first of
six persons charged on these felony counts and it is
believed the other five will now plead guilty.

RE; CHARLES CLARENCE HILL;
. JOSEPH "SOFIE" GEBRON, aka
ITWI
(DL_165-104)

On 10/7/63, DL 185-C-TE advised that GEBRON
was operating as a bookmaker for HILL and it was CI's
opinion they were accepting bets at a cleaning shop
they have recently opened on Ross Avenue (Phone TA 3-3180)..
On 10/7/63, PCI LESCHETSKO verified this stating that he
personally had placed bets with GEBRON. Dallas is
following this matter to ascertain if GEBRON and HILL
are in violation of a Federal statute.

None of the above information has been di.ss@-
minated during the past week by the Dallas Division ‘éx-
cept that concerning RUSSELL DOUGLAS MATTHEWS, as Bureau
interests are not secured at this time and dissemination
might possibly result in compromises of both above
informants at this time. LT. JACK REVILL was furnished:
information concerning MATTHEWS as obtained from DL 185-C-
TE and he stated he would attempt to ascertain the
circumstances concerning the death of MARONEY or MALONEY
at Waco, LT. REVILL has asiei that information concerning
the exact whereabouts of known bookmakers not be fur-
nished to him until such time as the Bureau does not have
any interest in the activities of these men or does not
care whether they are raided and arrested. He explained
that if he makes a-record of such information, the Vice
Squad will then receive instructions from their commander
‘to arrest these men at their place of operation. It is
the desire of the Dallas Office to ascertain if such
bookmakers are in violation of the Federal statutes prior
to having them arrested. It is also believed that any
arrest or activities by local authorities at this time
could possibly place the informants in jeopardy.
