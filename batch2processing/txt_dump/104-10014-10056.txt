Svisloch River where he was placed under full surveillance by the
Minsk UKGB. The Second Department--(foreign counterintelligence)
of the UKGB considered OSWALD an agent because he provided them
with information on his past. [Source Comment: It was common
practice in a UKGB to claim a foreigner living in its region as
an agent. A regional UKGB would forward the subject's physical
description, age, and any other information it gathered to KGB
Headquarters, claiming the subject as a foreign agent. Such
regionally claimed agents were not agents in the classic sense,
rather they were an attempt by the regional UKGB to gain
prestige. ]

3. Circa 1981 Colonel YURSHAK, then an instructor at the
Minsk CI School, stated that he had been involved in the OSWALD
Case when he was with the Minsk UKGB. The Minsk UKGB kept
numerous files on OSWALD which contained agent, surveillance, and
monitoring reports as well as other information. [Headquarters
Comment: When Source questioned the KGB's rationale for running
OSWALD, an ex-marine with very little access to information, he
was only assured that OSWALD was run in Minsk as an agent. ]
YURSHAK, who held a low opinion of OSWALD, stated that OSWALD was
a bit crazy and unpredictable. OSWALD was never required to sign
an agreement to cooperate, even though he was cooperating.
YURSHAK believed that OSWALD knew he was in contact with the KGB.

4. OSWALD was interrogated several times in Moscow by
officers from KGB Headquarters (NFI). OSWALD's KGB handlers
considered passing him to the First Chief Directorate [foreign
intelligence-~FCD] to be handled by a KGB Residency in the United
States, but-the proposal was ultimately rejected because OSWALD
was considered too unstable. Upon OSWALD's returned to the U.S.,
his files would have been sent to KGB Headquarters, probably to
Department 1 [American targets] of the SCD.

5. OSWALD fell into a deep depression in the USSR; he was
homesick and wanted to return to the United States. He
eventually received Soviet permission to return to the United
States with his wife, Marina. Once in the U.S., Marina angered
the KGB by refusing to continue cooperating with then.

6. {Headquarters Comment: At least six KGB officers and
former UKGB staff officers told Source about the OSWALD Case.
Their stories were consistent. Each of these officers told
Source that the KGB did not handle OSWALD after his redefection
to the U.S. and had no further contact with him. They also said
that the KGB never tasked OSWALD, and certainly never tasked him
to kill President Kennedy.] [Source Comment: The rumors in the

REKKEKEKEEAEEE
(ACTION: Background Information]

1. According to senior staff officers from theyMinsk KGB
Counterintelligence School [Minsk CI School] and Department 1
{American targets] of the Second Chief Directorate [internal
security and counterintelligence--SCD] Headquarters, ex-marine
Lee Harvey OSWALD was an agent of the KGB, and was one before he
met his future wife, Marina. The Minsk UKGB had recruited Marina
as a "swallow" [Soviet female prostitute] for use in sexual
entrapment operations. Marina was directed against OSWALD, who
fell in love with her, when he was living in Minsk.
[Headquarters Comment: It was unclear whether the local or
regional UKGB was involved.] Although she was interested in
OSWALD, Marina was more interested in getting away from the USSR
and poverty. The UKGB considered her an agent, albeit a
reluctant one.

2. Circa the late 1950s, following his defection to the
USSR, OSWALD was resettled in an apartment house close to both
the Minsk CI School and Victory Square in a beautiful area on the
