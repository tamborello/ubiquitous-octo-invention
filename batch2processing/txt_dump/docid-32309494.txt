Concerning Paragraph 2, page 2, Informant and
HEMMING advised. INTERPEN never had any airplanes of any
type and that a B-47 is a high altitude jet bomber used
by the United States Air Force, costs millions of dollars
and is not. available to the public.

Only Ltwo parachute~practices were held, one
on June 24, 1961, in which /Informant-flew the plane, and
HEMMING, JOE GARMAN, DICK WORLEY and FRANK LITTLE jumped.

, On June 27, 1961, Informant again rented an.
airplane, and HEMMING, GARMAN, DICK WATLEY, ORLANDO GARCIA
and FRANK LITTLE jumped. 7 So

oncerning Paragraph 3, page 2, both Informant

CG
g advised that AUGUSTIN CAPO had a boat. £CIA

and Hemmin
furnished. money for him fo uy radio equipment, but fe
never left Miami with it.j| glnvestigation reflected that

. and CAPO never left Miami. The boat was not a PT boat,
‘ and it was later repossessed by a creditor. CAPO never
_ had any arms. , : . :

o. There is no reason to believe HEMMING is a
double agent. PLATZ's opinion appears to be as’ incorrect

‘as the information he furnished. Informant said he had
never heard of PLATZ, who was never in charge of anything

for INTERPEN, and never made any parachute jumps with
INTERPEN. . :

- HEMMING advised that PLATZ came to Miami in
about March, 1961, worked with JAMES GENTRY, an American
soldier of fortune, in a junk yard for about a month and
a half. PLATZ went to the INTERPEN training camp, spent
one day, returned to Miami, and was never associated with
INTERPEN; was never a member, and made no ‘parachute jumps.
He never participated in INTERPEN's activities.

. HEMMING described PLATZ. as an. alcoholic, who
drinks up to two bottles of vodka a day, who has a repu-
tation for fighting in bars, and is completely unreliable.
_PLATZ spent the one day at INTERPEN training camp some
time in the middle of May, 1961. He was seen by HEMMING

the last time about five or six weeks ago in a cheap bar
and in a drunken condition.

(vYime Bureau will note that MM 639-S is in close ~
contact with INTERPEN and HEMMING and has been_reporting
- daily on INTERPEN's activities since May, 1961 4@)Al1
information concerning INTERPEN activities has-been fully
\ reported to the Bureau, and information furnished by PLATZ
is considered to be completely unreliable.
