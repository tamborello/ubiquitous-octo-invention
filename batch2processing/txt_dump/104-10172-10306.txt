1. On 4 May Grigoriy Ye. Golub phoned Costille for lunch for that day.

Most of the time was spent on polite conversation and no political teples
were discussed, Golub asked Costille about his home and family in the
States and his vacation plane. Golub mentioned that he was not going to
be able to take a vacation this sumner as he had hoped. When Costille asked
hia why, he gave the reason that the Ambassador, whom Golub described as
still being new and not quite sure of himself yet, had told him he wanted
him to remain in. Heleinkt as he was the only person of officer rank in the
Consular Section, (Station coment: ght be because of Khrushchev's

. Reported visit to Finland shortly - @ Te)

2e Not once during the lunch did the subject mentioned in references
concerning Costille's treatment in the Soviet Union come up.

3. Golub mentioned that he had been in Finland now for about four
years and that he had been enjoying himself very much and liked Finlend and
the Finns, He eaid that he was glad that he did not epeak English as he

‘ would then probably be sent to England or the United States, which in his
opinion were too far from his home in the Soviet Union. According to Golub,
this made travel home, as well as phone calls, too expensive, When Costille
asxed him where he would like to be sent next, he answered Moscow, He stated

that over three yesra was too long to be away from one's country.
