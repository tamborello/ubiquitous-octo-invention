NOTES

This is the Scott Breckinridge task force study which was prepared
/ last fall in response to the Church Committee book on the Kennedy

assassination. A copy of it was shownto Blakey. This i to me
' now with a suggestion from the IG that we send a copy to the SSCI and
HPSCI. .

I don't believe we should send it because it is extremely critical

of the Church Committee report (see page 9 of the introduction for a
sample). The Committee has not asked for this paper. Indeed I am not
sure they even know of it, although agbriet mention was made to Mike
Epstein recently. My concern is thafl'report will fan the flames and
cause them to resurrect these old questions for a new look. I certainly
don't mind letting them know when they do a poor job, but not when the
cost is another examination of the same questions. “I have explained my
point of view to Scott Breckinridge who said his concern was that we werg

, providing a report to the Assassinations Committee which was not being

/ provided to oversight committees, but the: this was a question for OLC.

He says he doesn't care if it is sent. .o the oversight committees or not
oi dagrees with my view’. this.
