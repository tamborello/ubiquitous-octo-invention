1, Imet with Mr. ‘Bundy this afternoon at the White House
and accomplished the following: .

a. LIinformed him that we would fly our next U~2 mission
over Cuba as soon as the weather was right, probably around
(40280 | Monday. I told him that this was our last approved one and
“x Iwould be hitting him early next week for further approvals,
2\ We discussed the air defense dangers and I mentioned casually
% Y _ the possibility of running two planes concurrently to assist in
. , .confusing the air defenses. He felt this would require Special
Group consideration and I agreed,

'b. TYeft him the original of Attachment #1 to BYE 3722-62.
He found it entirely adequate and said he would show it to the
( ; President on Monday. (This has to do with instructions to pilots
. overilying Cuba, and other related subjects.)

_@. Ishowed him Joe Charyk's memorandum on responses
developed in connection with the recent U-2 episode over
‘Sakhalin, He was interested and said he would get the original
from General Taylor's office. ;

d, Ireported Senator Holland's activities in Florida and
‘told him we were playing it in extremely lowkey. He agreed
and said that there was nothing to be concerned about, that we
would always have this type of activity by Senator Holland, and
that he was not operating under any Presidential instructions
but there was no point in making anything of it.

e, Itold Mr. Bundy that I had tried to put in writing the
President's concern about internal uprisings in Cuba and had
found it most difficult; accordingly I had passed the word orally
and was sure that our people understood what was wanted. He
agreed that we should not attempt to put anything in writing. ss:

{, lleft with him the original of the memorandum on British
Guiana: (I.also left the first page of the carbon.) He said he

would inform the President.

2. In addition to all the foregoing, I informed him of the recent
TACKLE flight, of the drop zones, and of our plans for Taiwan Straits
tonight. Ialso told him that we had cranked Cuba into the next "C"
‘shot and that we were now holding for weather. Ialso told him of the
newly acquired Medium Range Ballistic Missile near Anadyr.

3, In connection with the recent clamp on NPIC output, I'told
him that as far as the general Intelligence Community was aware, this
clamp had been directed by me as Acting DCI and not by any higher
authority, that there were only a very limited number of people at the
top echelon who knew that higher authority had in fact directed this.
He seemed reassured and was happy that it had been handled in this way.
We will continue this very closely held "need-to-know"! activity until
further notice insofar as it deals with an aggressive capability from

Cuba.

4, I consider the meeting most successful and plan to do this
several times a week, Mr. Knoche, please bear this in mind so that
you can keep feeding me similar items of information and action for

these meetings.
