By reversing the Mouse power supply polarity it should be
possibleto obtain selective coverage with the subject's cottage.

Costs of the leased line were discussed in Pittsburgh letter
dated 1/25/60.

If it is possible to obtain the desired disguised wire and this
proposal is approved, it is requested that the Laboratory
forward two additional Mouse pre-amp units and one additional
power supply.

Re your letter 1-25-60, and your airtel 3-1-60, concerning proposed
misur coverage of subject's cottage. : a

The Bureau is in agreement with the conclusion previously stated in
your letter dated 1-25-60, that use of twisted-pair telephone drop wire’ by
local telephone company precludes use of Bureau's disguised four-conductor
parallel type drog wire on proposed misur installation. Appearance of;parailel
type drop wire in an area where twisted-pair drop wire is used exclusively
would arouse curiosity of telephone company employees and. possibly would also —
be noticed by subject. Its use would present a definite security hazard to the
misur installation, Loe

The Laboratory has on previous occasions attempted to have disguised
four~conductor twisted-pair type drop wire manufactured for use under i
conditions such as encountered in this case. I has not been possible to obtain
this type wire because of production difficulties encountered in attempting to —
conceal an extra wire within the thin insulation of the twisted-pair type tele-
phone drop wire. ; : poas

The misur installation proposed in your airtel dated 3-1-60,is not. -
approved since no suitably disguised drop wire is available for microphone |

ReBuairtel, 2/10/60, Pittsburgh airtel, 2/4/60, Buairtel, 2/1/60,
and Pittsburgh letter, 1/25/60.

In regard to obtaining the desired misur coverage of the subject's
cottage, the following proposal is submitted for the Bureau's
consideration.

z
This proposal is based on two assumptions:

1. That the subject will request telephone service
within the next few months. This assumption could be verified by
pretext inquiry but it is not deemed discreet to do so at this
time. Therefore, if this proposal is approved, it will be
understood that it is possible that the necessary preparations
might be wasted if the subject does not request telephone service.
On the other hand, if preparations are delayed until telephone
service is requested, it may well be that no opportunity will
present itself to make the interior portion of the installation.

2. That it will be possible to discreetly install an
appropriate dissuised four-conductor drop line from the road to
the subject's cottage. There are two alternatives.

The first alternative would be to attempt to use available parallel
type disguised line. The Kittanning Telephone Co., which would
fr serve the cottage, does not use this type of line. Instead, they
ip ye use a twisted-pair type of line in all instances where the Bell

LW) Telephone Co., would use parallel type. If an exception was-made
: in this case, it would undoubtedly make Kittanning linemen curious.
Suit It is believed that a suitable pretext could be given them by our
dt contact with the Engineering Department of the company, however.
It is doubtful that the subject would notice the exception but this
ossibility of course exists. Another, and perhaps % more serious

consideration, is the fact that it might prove impossible to
disguise the pole-end termination of the extra pair so that
it would not be obvious to a-“telephone lineman. i

The second and preferable alternative would be for the Laboratory

to obtain or have made approximately 275 yards of disguised four
conductor twisted-pair drop line. A sample of the type normally
used by the Kittanning Telephone Co., is being forwarded to the
Laboratory under separate cover. They buy this wire from the
Whitney-Blake Co., but also occasionally get a similar type from
Graybar. If such disguised wire can be furnished then a more
discreet installation could be made. There would be no possibility
of the subject becoming curious and it would be possible to
appropriately disguise the pole termination of the extra pair. It
is felt that, if necessary, the disguised twisted pair could be

made slightly larger without being noticed. Because of the
relatively long distance over which such a disguised drop line will
have to be carried, care would be necessary to assure that the

wires were large enought of offer low electrical resistance and
strong enought to support themselves. It has been learned that a total
of three support poles will be used between the road &nd the cottage
(a distance of about 225 yards).

In this proposal, it is assumed that the Laboratory will be able
to obtain the desired disguised twisted-pair line.

It is proposed that, as soon as. adquate security can be obtained,
this office install 3 Mouse units in the manner and locations
illustrated on Figure 5 of Pittsburgh letter dated 1/25/60. With
the exception of the Sigma relay, limiting resistors and subject's
telephone line, the leads to these Mouse units would be connected
as illustrated on the sketch attached to Pittsburgh airtel dated
2/4/60. The leads for the Mouse units would, of course, eventially
be connected to the extra pair in the proposed drop line.

Once the above portion of the installation is completed, it will be
necessary to wait until the subject requests telephone service.

When he does so, arrangements will be made to install the disguised
drop line from pole 29 (see figure 6 of Pittsburgh letter dated

1/25/60), to the cottage. It will be hoped that the Mouse units can 4
be connected to the extra, pair at the same time the subject's i
instrument is installed. . : |

Once these portions are completed, steps would be taken to obtain a
. leased line extending from pole 29 to the central plant in the
Pittsburgh Office.
