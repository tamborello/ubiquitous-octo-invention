- On 3/17/69 informant said he brought up in
conversation: with SCAFIDI the fact that there had been
some news in. the paper that CARL CIVELLA, along with some
others, had been arrested or in trouble in Miami, Fla.
Turning the conversation to CIVELLA, he asked. JOSEPH SCAFIDI
whether or not CIVELLA was going to replace VITO GENOVESE
(deceased) as the head of VITO GENOVESE's family, LCN, as
well as being made a member of the Commission LCN. Infor-
mant said that SCAFIDI told him that Philadelphia underboss
IGNATIUS DENARO said when SCAFIDI last talked to him that
CARL CIVELLA was. going to be a member of the commission.
SCAFIDI, however, indicated to the source that he did not
know whether or not CIVELLA would head VITO GENOVESE's family
of LCN. Informant said that this verified in his mind that
it was "definite" that CIVELLA was going to be a member of
the Commission LCN. Informant could develop no additional
information as to whether or not CIVELLA had his own LCN
family or whether or not he was connected with the-VITO
GENOVESE family in any way, and pointed out SCAFIDI had
previously told the source he did not know CIVELLA personally
but had only heard of him.

 

It is pointed out to interested offices that
PH 672-C-TE has been reliable LCN member source for over
five, years; and accordingly, the above information is
considered reliable by the Philadelphia Office. Consideration
can be given, however, to the fact that Philadelphia undérboss
IGNATIUS DENARO could be mistaken as to identities.

Kansas City and New York should consider contacting
logical sources to ascertain if CIVELLA is in fact being
piaced on the Commission LCN.

; Philadelphia will remain alert to develop any
additional information in this regard.
