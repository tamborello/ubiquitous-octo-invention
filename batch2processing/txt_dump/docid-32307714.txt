FROM Malcolm R. Wilkey, Assistant Attorney General,
. Criminal Division

4 SUBJECT: United States v. Joseph onanno et al.; - 1123-51-17
St Appearance of Bureau Agents as Witnesses

(Cy The trial in the subject case has been set for October 26,
1959. Attached is a list of names of FBI agents who conducted
interviews of defendants and co-conspirators, most of whom will
be called to give testimony at the trial. Usually two agents
participated in an interview and under normal circumstances only
one of these would be needed for trial testimony. In this case 3
however, the attorney in charge of the case. has indicated that , &
he would prefer to see both agents in advance of the time of ‘
testifying for purposes of preparation and, if possible, would
prefer to have both present while the principal witnesses testify f
® in the event the other is needed. . %

  
  

In order to cause as little interference as possible with
the other duties of the agents involved, it is requested that you
authorize the individual agents to contact Mr. Milton R. Wessel, —
Special Assistant to the Attorney General, United States Court
House, Foley Square, New York City, Courtland 7-7100, in order
to arrange a time and date of interview which is mutually con-
venient.

With the commencement of the trial itself Mr. Wessel will . ;
prepare a schedule of the estimated dates when the various agents. °

will be required for the purpose of giving testimony.

In the event that for some reason any of the listed agents
will not be available for interview prior to October 19, ‘or for

*. the purpose of giving testimony at the trial, it is requested
4 > 3 that we be so advised as soon as possible. aa 4 .
