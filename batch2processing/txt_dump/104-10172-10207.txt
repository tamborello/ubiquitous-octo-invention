English, but ber vocatulary is quite linited. che seens to be fairly well
educated, and she referred once or twice to “tne institute in descow" which

she. had attended, che ssid abe was born in the north Caucasua. Politics were
| BOt discussed at all. She rade no deroyatary coments «bout their lest post

- dad Oslo ., nor about Denmark or tre Caited States. she anid she liked
‘living ia Calo § and thought it a beautiful country. ,

3. ¥e do not know LOBANCV!s @ motive tn tringing up A LADLE’ s name.
COSTILLE and LOBANCY . were standing alove at. tne time but the rocm was
crowded and several groups of people were talking nearby. | LORANOV's
question about -2LA0Le wae very mtter-cfefaot, and te did not lower his voice
or aak the question ina furtive mixer. iovever, the rooa was fairly
nolay, snd LORANOV’ would have produbly realized that the converestion could

not be overheard. It is somewhat strange se referred to ALLAULS by "GOLUBTSIN®

6 name rather than the actus] mame A:LADiN used in Helsinki. {ff LOBAKOV
had sentioned the neme AcLADLS used in ‘Helsinki }, COSPILLE would have proba-
bly admitted knowing AZLADL.. To reve done othereise would have been an
obvious lie. e can only guess at tuis atagea af the contact that | LOBANOV
was simply interested in finding out what heppened to AELADLE, [t would

seem logical that LOBANOV . ned known previously that COLTILLS hes had some
contact with AELADLE in Helsinki, ferhaps LOZAMOV's's motive will beoaxe
evident in subsequent contacts. As of this writing he has not attempted to re-
contest COSTILLE. fe will keep Headguarters inforsed.
