of Latin Americans to the Soviet Bloc and Cuba. Six reports of
particular interest consleted of information on Transcontinental S.A.,
@ company allegedly engaged in tho illegal transshipment of US goods
to Cuba. Other reports of significance dealt with the contacts and
activities of former Guatemalan President Juan Jose AREVALO Barneja,

now. living in Mexico. There was reporting on Kicaraguan and Spanish — .

exile activity in Mexico and on tho revolutionary sentiment and
expectations of other Latin American nationals.

2. LIFEAT has providet positive intelligence of value and of
relevance to customer requirements and to objectives of the PNIO.

1, Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of
concentrating LIFEAT or LLENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known
Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mexico City. The Station
in the past has undertaken this type coverage and will continue such
coverage in the future as LIFEAT and LIENVOY facilities become avail-
able for assignment to these targets. As Headquarters is aware, thie Station
can and will cover any possible target Headquarters considers of high

enough priority to cover.

2. For éxample, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 1956, 1957,
1960 and 1901; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue

the coverage.
