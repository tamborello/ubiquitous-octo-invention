 

8. Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Asency,
the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JNIWAVE. On
dias rer mere wey uccaslonis Since ai Bast the ear Ly 3350° a Dibba: Ww
had claimed Agency affiliation when in fact there has been
none. The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such
affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteercd his services
to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Gerald Patrick HEMMING
is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),
aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In
the late 1950's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter
Claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thereafter,
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and
Central American activities which he named the International
Anti-Conmunist Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
{the backers of whom have never been fully established) was
named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

9. For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of
a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot
involving HENMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
memorandum, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 Jun>
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, .Jr.;
and an extract from a book published in early 1976 written by
Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN. The bock Coup d'etat
in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F. Ke
is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the A
with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the major
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT
Jr, to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-
nental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
and that members of this unit were connected with CIA. GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.

2. |. ...4 provided the writer with a copy ef the cable
(IN 944357, 7 ne dated 8 June 1975), :
which is attached. In substance, the cable reflects that

circa § June 1976 a Guatemalan source, with snowledge of
Guatemalan President LAUGERUD, provided the | Station -
a written report, and a detailed briefing, concerning a plot

to assassinate President LAUGERUD. According to the informa.
tion the plot was to have been carried out on 15 September
1975; however,’ one of the major conspirators, Jorge Antonio
"Cokie" ZIMERI Safie left Guatemala in August 1975 as a result
of an attack upon his, ZIMERI's, life. ZIMERI has been living
in Miami since August 1975. . .

 

 

3. According to the réport, the National Liberation
Movement was involved with ZINERI in the assassination plot
and ZIMERI in turn was involved with two Americans, brothers,
Robert and Gerald Patrick HEMMING, The HENNING brothers -

NOTE: The [__] Station atso included
information the Chief—of Station had received
from ~ . on 8 Junc.’ “ gaid that he
had peen providing information on ZIMERI to the
Guatemalan government for the past six months or
so. He claimed that two Americans were involved
with ZIMERI, one of them who runs a guard service
in Miami. _ .. did not mention names but
described one of the-Americans as about six feet
four inches and weighing about 230 pounds.

4. The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends
with five requests for information by President LAUGERUD:

a. Is ZIMERI still in the United States?

b. In the event ZIMERI is not in the United
States legally, deport him to Guatemala.

c. Is ZIMERI recruiting merceraries in the
United States for possible use in
Guatemala?

ad, Does ZIMERI receive any kind of preferen-.
- tial treatment by U. S. authorities which
permit him to carry firearms, as well as
to purchase arms and ammunition for
shipment to Guatemala?

-e. Any information on Robert and Gerald
HEMMING? ~.
5.. On 19 June 1976 . oo advised
that DDO is referring the entire matter to the FBI and State
Department. :

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent
yariations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HENMING.

7. From the name, physical description, activity, and
alleged employment, it is apparent that Gerald Patrick HEMNIN
is identical with the subject of Office of Security file
429 229, who has been described as. six-foot five, 250 pounds,
who is a notorious mercenary and soldier of fortune and who as
of May 1975 was ostensibly employed by a private investigation
company, TEPCOL Security (Office of Security--no record) in
Niami, Florida.
