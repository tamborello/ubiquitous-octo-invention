’ Dear Mr. Fauntroy,

I read in yesterday's . Washington Post that you believe + it
_ possible that some U.S. journalists are in fact CIA agents and ~
engaged in a conspiracy to frustrate the work of your House
Assassinations Committee. .

Let me assure you that there are no working U. Ss. journal ists” 7
employed by the Central Intelligence Agency.

: Let me further assure you in the most unequivocal terms :
that I will not. tolerate any actions by any members of the Central ;
Intelligence Agency to impede your investigation. On the contrary, ~
you will have our most complete cooperation. Please advise me
personally + if there is any way in which you feel this is not being
lone.

Yours si ncerelys
