On 2/2/62 Departmental Attorney WILLIAM KEHOE, currently
conducting a FGJ in Pittsburgh to. inquire into the activities

of the MANNARINOs and their associates, advised SA THOMAS G.
FORSYTH, III as follows:

} v -
\ He has heard thatC___————idS-P aka[L_____} who was convicted
for his participation in the case captioned "STUART SUTOR,
et al; TGP; ITSP; FFA; NM; CONSPIRACY," and is. currently
inearcerated in the Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pa.,
is very unhappy. While his convicted co-defendants are taking
their imprisonments in the best possible s irits;

\ becomes increasingly unsettled. Although was an
unfaithful spouse, he was always a doting father, and the
forced separation from his only son, a ten year old, griwes
him greatly. :

when[___]was arrested during the IRS raid on the MANNARINO
horse room-gambling casino on 8/24/61, KEHOE noted that
ot would not talk with anyone connected with the Federal
OW Government until he was brought into the Federal Building,

oY Al Pitts to await his turn at a USC hearing. At that

ao time, was observed by KEHOE to leave his associates and_

v approach SA FORSYTH_who was present merely as an observer, andl »
c it was noted that [___] spoke earnestly, courteously and v4

at length with SA FORSYTH.

It is KEHOE's feeling that L__], ‘if he were so inclined,
could make an excellent witness against the MANNARINOs and
KEHOE feels he should be interviewed with this purpose

in mind at the earliest possible date. KEHOE requested_.t. at

SA FORSYTH go to Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg,

to conduct the interview, rather than have it conducted

by a SA from the Philadelphia Division, because SA FORSYTH

is thoroughly conversant with all aspects of the MANNARINO

investigations and has established a speaking relationship with
which now might prove effectual in persuading |

to cooperate.

It is noted that KEHOR_indicated that he might have a "deal"
to offer[____] should L decide to cooperate with the
Government against the MANNARINOs. At this juncture, KEHOE
was advised that SA FORSYTH could not take any part in .
discussions concerning any deals and didimt even want to hear
the nature of the inducement KEHOE would offer L___].

KEHOE was advised that if Bureau permission was recei

SA FORSYTH would welcome an opportunity to talk with

and would. bend every effort to persuade [___ ]to cooperate,
but SA FORSYTH could not relay any message concerning a
"geal." KEHOE was told that_any such message

would have to be gotten tof] by some other means and
KEHOE replied that he understood and would, at the
appropriate time, make his own arrangements.

Bureau permission is therefore requested for SA FORSYTH
to travel to Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pa., and
to interviewL___}
