45 minutes previously. Babour said he had information from an

unnamed informant who was a Haitian citizen. The informant told .
Babour there was going to be another shipment of arms to Port Au Prince,
Haiti. The informant wanted Babour to give hin $10,000 for his
operdtions gqurorman said ere were 27 Americans involved including
one Leonar ird and Josep erola (Teague said there was no record

on Bird,and Merola is a top jewel‘thiéf who lives in Miami Beach.).

} .

Informant told Babour that five FBI men are involved in this
matter. Teague told Babour this was ridiculous. Babour said informant
would not tell. him who was involved until he got money. Informant

: told Babour that there was a place for storage of arms and ammunition
within one hour of Miamis also, there was a $70,000 cache of arms on
an island between Florida and Hatti. Informant said further that
some unknown pilot was allegedly given $10,000 to fly arms to Haiti.
The pilot's wife is a cousin of a Mr. Dillard, who owns a lumber
company in Miami. Dillard allegedly is trying to get a lumber
contract in Haiti. :

Teague pressed the Vice Consul for the name of the
informant but the Vice Consul did not give it to him because he said
he was still dealing with the informant and that he would get further
details. Teague told: Babour that unless he gave hin full informatio
there wag not much we could do regarding this. Teague furnished Po
Babour the name of Wyatt, the Agent in Charge of Customs in Miami hee
because of the allegation on ‘shipment of arms. Teague is also
advising Customs. Ct
ACTION: J

I told. Teague that he should run this out as far as he
could based on the limited information; that he should try to tdentify
the unknown pilot, and-possibly interview Dilliard, the lumber man.
I told him that as the allegation involves an alleged plot to send an

expeditionary force to Haiti, we should conduct investigation until
we could establish whether there was truth to the allegation. :
