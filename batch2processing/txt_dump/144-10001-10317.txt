On the subject of the conversation which’ MIKOYAN had with
President JOHNSON, the Department told us that it does not yet
have a record of fine conversation, As far’ ‘as our interlocutor
knew the conversation was of a general nature. MIKOYAN, after
expressing the sincere sorrow of the head of the Soviet: Govern-
ment and the entire Soviet population. ‘for the tragic death of
President KENNEDY, expressed hope that relations between the
two countriés could continue to develop peacefully in conformity
with the KENNEDY policy. President JOHNSON gave assurances that
it is his firm intention to keep the preceding line of: ‘policy
unaltered. . :

MIKOYAN then met with-RUSK.

The conversation lasted about an hour. The Department told
us that MIKOYAN began by repeating the ideas expressed to JOHNSON,
and RUSK assured him-that the change of Presidents did not mean
a change in the foréign policy of the United States. ‘In spite of
the fact that the-two countries have different positions on many
international questions--RUSK continued--it is necessary to
explore the arga of common interests even if it is not possible
to conclude formal agreements.

The conversation was then devoted to problems of disarmament,

limitation of the arms race, and reduction of military expenditures.
Particular importance was given to the mestion of nondissemination

of nuclear arms. On this last aspect MIKOYAN repeated the well-
known Soviet thesis concerning the incompatibility between an
agreement on nondissemination and the establishment of a NATO
multilateral force.

 

Bilateral problems were then briefly mentioned and RUSK
expressed hope that discussions on a consular agreement and
negotiations on cultural exchange can be fruitful.

RUSK then concluded the talk by affirming that, on the

broader international problems, the United States will discuss
the Western position with its allies in December.
