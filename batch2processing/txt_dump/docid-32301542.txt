sons mentioned in re Philadelphia airtel, the following

observations were made by the Baltimore Division upon the
initial review of re airtel.

No prior information could be identified with the
names JOE RANDOM and his brother TONY COVELLI., Although
it was known that the Baltimore Pizza Crust, Ine. had been
attempting to merge with a firm in Washington, D.C., @
check of the State of Maryland Corporation files did not
reflect that any such merger had ever materialized.

With specific reference to information in paragraph 4

of page 2 of re airtel, which is set out as topic number 1,

with PETER MAGGIO and bearing the name "JOE TAMBERELLO" (ph) is
possibly identical with JOSEPH’ TAMBURELLO, who operates an
Italian neighborhood grocery store. Baltimore files reflect -
that on 2/3/59, Special Agents of the Baltimore Division
observed fUIGI MORICI and FRANK CORBI, brother of JOSEPH
CORBI, at the Dizzy Klub Tavern, Holabird Avenue, Dundalk,’
Maryland. MORICI has long had the reputation of being the
senior statesman in the Italian Criminal Organization. The
Dizzy Klub was and still is operated by JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI,

who came to Baltimore over 20 years aeo from Pittsburgh where
he had the reputation of being in the "Black Hand" Society.

On the foregoing occasion, an unidentified white male, driving
the automobile registered. to FRANK MALVASO, parked at the
Dizzy.Klub and entered, Later MORICI and FRANK CORBI left

the club in MORICI's car and drove to Highland Avenue and

E. Lombard Street where they parked and entered the grocery
store of JOSEPH TAMBURELLO. .

Nothing of TAMBURELLO until
5/20/64 when PCI pena eeeaavised that he,.as an
accountant, had begun keeping the accounts for JOSEPH ,
TAMBURELLO, who operates a grocery store at Highland Avenue
and Lombard Streets. He had acquired this account through
LOUIS COMI and JOHN COMI, whose Dodge Cigarette Service is-
nearby. The store reported weekly sales. of $2,000 and
annual net profit of $3,000.00. Informant said that
TAMBURELLO is assisted in the operation of the store by
his wife, HELEN, and they have 3 minor children. Informant
had never observed or heard anything which would indicate
they were involved in gambling operations. He commented
that TAMBURELLO speaks with a heavy Italian accent.

No indication has ever been received that TAMBURELLO
has ever had any connection with the Baltimore Pizza- Crust
Ine., which is located on the opposite side of Baltimore
from TAMBURELLO's store. No mention of him appears in any
of the corporation's records or in connection with financial
transactions which are reflected in bank records. It ap-.
pears certain that he has not been engaged in the active
management of the pizza business and would have no way ~
of acquiring the knowledge set out in the conversation at-
tributed to him on the succeeding pages of re airtel.

With regard‘ to topic number 2, in paragraph 5 of

-2.
