for this information and the men stated they had seen her in
MARTINEZ' company the week end before. in New York, which in-
formant stated was true. When she refused to tell them
anything they slapped her around before letting her.go. When

report it to the police, to which she replied if she had done
so she wokld have had to tell them all She knew about him,

Informant said. MARTINEZ has access to a private
plane because he. flew from Miami to New York on the occasion

from insurance companies in~South America or the United States.
MARTINEZ made frequent trips to Caracas, Venezuela, and in
July or August, 1958, he called from Miami and said he was
going to go “across the water” which she took to mean Cuba.

She said MARTINEZ has stated that he met with CASTRO, the head
-of the Cuban Rebens, in the past.

information she would presume that any arms which were trans-
ported to Miami from New York would end up at the Trade Winds
Hotel, Miami, which is where FRANCISCO BARONA ALONSO stays
while he is in Miami. It is informant's opinion that ALONSO
spends most of his time in Florida.

Westchester, New York, by the name of TOATER (Phonetic).

said he was going to up-state New York and then to Miami
and would be in Canton on Monday or Tussday,. October 13 or
14, 1958, and he did not want her to tell anyone where he was
going to be, Informant stated that MARTINEZ was explicit in
telling her that he was going to be in up-State New York and
then Miami, then Canton, and she. did-not know why he made such
a point of making this clear to her. At this time MARTINEZ
also asked her to obtain twenty dollars which a friend owed-
him and send it by Money Order to him at the Main Office of
Western Union, New York, which she did. He promised to send
informant the $340 he owed her on Cctober 11, 1958, but to
date it has not been received.

Informant said that she had no definite information
that MARTINEZ was responsible for the theft of instant
weapons at the Canton Armory but when she read it in the news-
paper she immediately thought that he would be the logical
person to dispose of such a quantity of arms and that he
possibly had done so to make up for-the weapons he failed to
get when he lost the $30, 000 given him by the Cuban Rebels for
this purpose.

from 1952 to 1955, and was in Military Intelligence in

Germany for 22 months.
—e

She is a former girlfriend of LOUIS MARTINEZ, having
broken up with him in September, 1958, after going with him
for three years. She has known for some time that MARTINEZ
has been working on behalf of the Cuban Rebel forces to obtain
arms and equipment for them. MARTINEZ, who is an attorney, has
told informant that he is legally engaged in this activity
and assists the Rebels in obtaining export licenses for
equipment.

One associate of MARTINEZ is MARTEN RUTHSORD,
535 West lllth, New York City, who is an industrial engineer
for some enterprise company. RUTHFORD's ttelephone number is
ACademy 2-0872, and informant has determined MARTINEZ! where-

‘abouts on previous occasions by calling RUTHFORD, RUTHFORD

is a demolition expert, having served in this capacity in

the Armed Forces and was. to do a demolition job for Cuban
Rebels on ammunition supply of Battista Government. RUTHFORD
was to receive $375,000 for this job, half of which was to

go to MARTINEZ. ~-

wears black patch cover right eye, has even white teeth,
medium build.

Informant advised that MARTINEZ' activities on
behalf of the Cuban Rebels has only come to her attention
Since March or April of this year. .

Another associate of MARTINEZ is PETER LEBLOVICH,
Montclair, New Jersey. Several months»ago LEBLOVICH was suppose?
to have given MARTINEZ $30,000 to obtain weapons, which was
lost. Informant stated that MARTINEZ has blamed her for the
loss because he was coming to Ohio to see her after receiving
this money so he gave it to another fellow who was to complete
the transaction for the weapons. Either the money was stolen

by this individual or.lost in some manner because MARTINEZ

has been held responsible by the Cuban Rebels for its loss,
and they have apparently been pressing him for the money or
the arms. Informant said that in June, July, or August, 1958,

MARTINEZ was in British Honduras checking on the $30,000 for

the man who had it had disappeared either from New York or
Washington, D. C. Informant said on one occasion MARTINEZ
showed her a check for $27,000 which LEBLOVICH was supposed
to have given him. She said MARTINEZ was prone to boast when
he was doing well but if things were going badly for htm he‘
was-not talkative.

Informant continved that in either July or August,
1958, MARTINEZ was in Toronto, Canada, negotiating the — :
purchase of ten surplus fighter planes. MARTINEZ had invited
her to meet him in Toronto, which she did. She said she saw
these planes, which were silver in color, at. ithe Municipal
Airport in Toronto. MARTINEZ had engaged four Panamanian
pilots to fly the planes from Canada; but although they were
permitted to travel to the United States, the Canadian
Authorities would not allow thei to enter Canada to pilot the
planes from Toronto. Informant stated that it is her under-
standing that the planes are now in New Jersey, possibly. around
LEBLOVICH's home, but she was unable to furnish information as
to how they were piloted there.

While in Toronto, two men from Milwaukee were there |
with MARTINEZ. One whom she knew as "VIC" had his wife with
him. "VIC" was five feet three inches tall, sixty years of age,
thin build. The other she knew as MERLIN. She gathered from
their conversation that both were American industrialista, and
that possibly the surplus planes had been purchased from "VIC."
She said that "VIC" claimed to have lived in Canada at one
time, formerly served in the Canadian Air Force, and had an
expensive home now in Milwaukee. : .

Informant stated that in the three years that she
dated MARTINEZ she frequently went to New York for a weekend
and usually stayed at the Edison Hotel. In May, 1958, she
went to New York and presumed she would stay at the Edison
Hotel; however, MARTINEZ obtained a room for her at the
Manhatten Hotel. She stated that the reason for this was
that MARTINEZ was meeting with a group of men whom she
assumed to be Cuban Rebels at the Edison Hotel, and for this
