MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, HRG
FROM: Bryant Rogers
SUBJECT: JFK Microfilm Collection

1. In discussions with Tom Burkhardt in P&PG he has
indicated that they could support our requirements to
‘convert 72 reels of microfilm to hard copy for redaction.
While last year the estimate for the entire job was $16,000,
he thought to be safe we should allow $25,000 today. If we
wanted two copies of each image, which would save each
reviewer the time to make a working copy, we should be |
prepared to double the above price. These eStimates assume
we need to copy all reels of film. However, we may not. need
to copy the Oswald 201 material (14 reels) if we can assure
ourselves it is a duplicate of material we already
processed. Also, since reels 57, 58 and 59 contain
personnel files, we may determine, after reviewing the film,
that these can be denied in full. By reviewing the film
more carefully, we may be able to find other reels that need
not be copied. Another cost that we should factor in should
be the cost of a microfilm reader, if we are unable to
obtain a loaner.

2. I am told that each roll of microfilm averages 2400
images, so we are dealing with a large volume of 172,000
images. Converted to paper, this would fill an entire skid,
or two skids, if we had two copies of each image made.
Another way of looking at the volume is to consider that the
DO previously printed 45 reels of microfilm which filled 35
boxes. Using this ratio, 72 reels would fill 56 boxes.
Unless we could ship out some of our current holdings, we
would be hard pressed to store this many additional ~
documents. One option we could explore would be to have
P&PG phase the job over a period of time where they would
process only a few reels at a time. Unless we can find
vaulted storage space in Rosslyn, we may be forced to send
some completed boxes to the records center for temporary
storage. .

3. As explained to John Carver last year, this job
would be sent to an off-site contractor by P&PG. The
process involves transferring the microfilm images directly
onto a paper roll, uncut, thus, the person doing the job
would not see the hard copies. P&PG would then bring the
roll back to Hgs and cut it in to individual wa -
