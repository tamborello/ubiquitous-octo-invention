from the Munich Criminal Police, SUSANNE FEUGER left Munich,
Germany, on 2/7/63, by Pan American Airways, en route to Frankfurt/

#59, departing Frankfurt/Main, 12:35 PM, February 7, 1963, to
arrive at Chicago, Illinois 11:20 BM, February 7, 1963.

 

The BKA also stated that it had been unable to develop
any further information regarding the activities or present
whereabouts of the subject himself.

The BKA has been informed that the subject reportedly
returned to Chicago on the afternoon of February 4, 1963. The BKA-
was also advised that it might discontinue further active investi-

tion which its alerts to date may produce. If any such additional
data is received it will, of course, be reported but this case
is being RUC'd at this time.

On February 8, 1963, the U.S. Operations and Research
Detachment informed that it had been unable to intercept any
communications to FEUGER's mother noting that the location of her
current address made only chance coverage through the Munich
Post office al
