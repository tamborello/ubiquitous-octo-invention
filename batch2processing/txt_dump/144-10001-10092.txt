On 24 November [reported ‘from Havana:

1. All information connected with the assassination is’being studied
in detail by the local leadership. They believe the present-situation to be
very serious. Their presumption was confirmed by the direction taken by the
search for KENNEDY's murderers, that is among Castroites, Communists and USSR
influence. They are concerned with the anti-Cuban and anti-Soviet past which
will exert a substantial influence on the foreign’ and domestic policy of the
USA. This will be possible because there is a-iack of a head of government
with the authority and modernistic leanings which KENNEDY represented.

2. Ultrareactionary circles in “the USA, the Pentagon and the (B val Cc)
TA considered KENNEDY's policy too .weak and conciliatory and its continuation
as dangerous to them. It is believed here that the assassination may be
connected with the partially gontroversial position of KENNEDY and that it
actually could have been plafned or committed by these circles. The fact of
the assassination was immediately used by them to increase positive influences
on the Department of State and to turn world opinion away from the real
culprits and intention.

30 Thé” aseaseinnbion is being used to strengthen conservative circles
throughout, -Latin America. They fear that an adventurous decision will be
made with regards to Venezuela.
