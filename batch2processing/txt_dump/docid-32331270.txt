. ARMANd CERAML, a close associate of subject
| ; and owner of Tony Sweet's Restaurant in Miami, supposedly
opened another restaurant.in Miami recently. The name
of this restaurant is not yet known.

On. 3/12/62, NY 99-C advised SA ARTHUR P.
DUFFY that ANTHONY" PUSSY" RUSSO and. CHARLES TOURINE have
had the gambling concessionduring the current winter
S@ason at the Harbor Spa, 79th St. Causeway, Miami Beach, f
Fla., and at the Harbor Spa or Mayflower Hotel, Palm -
Beach, Fla. In this last connection, the informant was
unable to advise whether the Mayflower Hotel is now known
as the Harbor Spa or the Harbor Spa referred to the health !
facilities within the Mayflower Hotel.in Palm Beach, Fla. , {
The gambling concession is operated out of the cigar stands
in each of the above named places. Within the three week
period prior to 3/12/62, JIMMY (LNU), opwating the cigar ‘
stand at the Harbor Spa, Miami Beach, Fla, had roped in ut
a "sucker" who was an out of town businéssman. The "sucker"
-had been staying at the Harbor Spa and waszroped into a
"tip game" and lost somewhere between thirty and thirty }
five thousand dollars. After being clipped for this
amount, the victim had to go out of town, allegedly to his
home to pick up sufficient cash to cover the loss.

The informant was not aware of the identities {
of the individuals who actually clipped the victim, but
‘expressed the opinion that it could have been RUSSO and
TOURINE or others working for‘them.

 

 

: . LARRY . PASKOW is the apparent owner of. the Harbor

Spa, Miami Beach, Fla., Harbor Spa, Palm Beach, Fla.,
y and the Harbor Spa in. West End, NJ. It has been rumored
f that RUSSO and TOURINE purchased the Harbor Spa in West :
End, NJ, from PASKOW and then leased it back to him. This
} would have been done by TOURINE and RUSSO using someone
; or.some corporation as a front and their names. would not
appear.on any of the records. The basis for the operation
of the gambling concession in the Harbor Spa,.Miami Beach,
and Harbor Spa, Palm Beach,. by RUSSO and TOURINE is
unknown, but the possibility exists that they operate
in return for financial consideration extended to PASKOW. av
