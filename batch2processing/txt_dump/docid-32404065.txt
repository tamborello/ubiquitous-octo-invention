SUBJECT: Release of Bay of Pigs Records

As we discussed, CIA plans to begin releasing to the
National Archives declassified records related to the Bay of
Pigs covert action. This is part of the Agency’s Historical
Review Program, which focuses on declassifying records of
historical value.

Attached for the ARRB’s information is a brief
description of the records that we expect to release first,
probably within the next few weeks. We expect to make a
public announcement once the date for transfer of the
records to NARA is firm.

Release of CIA Records
Pertaining to the Bay of Pigs Covert Action

The Center for the Study of Intelligence is releasing
to the National Archives approximately 5,000 pages of
declassified CIA records regarding the covert action
culminating in the paramilitary invasion of Cuba in April
1961 at the Bay of Pigs. The Center anticipates releasing
further records after completion of additional
declassification reviews.

The documents contained in the initial release include
the Agency's “official history” of the Bay of Pigs by Jack
B. Pfeiffer, accompanied by the author's research notes. A
second paper consists of an after-action assessment prepared
shortly after the Bay of Pigs landing by the official
primarily responsible for preparing the plans for the
paramilitary action. Finally, the Center is releasing the
report of CIA’s Inspector General,.issued in November 1961
and the response of the Directorate of Plans in January
1962.

NX

Together, these records provide a general overview of
developments leading up to the policy decision to initiate a
covert action directed at the Castro regime in Cuba, the
evolution of CIA plans to carry out the decision, and
internal post-mortems into the failed invasion at the Bay of
Pigs.
