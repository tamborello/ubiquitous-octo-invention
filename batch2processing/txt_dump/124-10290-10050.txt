: Several plans of action were discussed at the
meeting and it was algo brought out that a master plan
was. needed for the organization, One plan discussed was

that acts-of violence would be committed in the 0, Bu5 0.
and this group would make it appear that Castro Agente:
from Cuba are involved, thus creating ill feelings between
the U. S. and Cuba. Another plan discussed was the ~~ :
renting of several apartments in various parts of the U, $,_
including Los Angeles and New York. Anti-CASTRO Cubans
playing the role of Castro Agents could draw attention
&o these apartments by being very loud and carrying Lo
packeges in and out of the apartments to make them appear ;
suspicious, When they felt they had attracted attention, :
they would mention names of several dignitaries so thah
these names would find their way back tothe FRI and
sxeate investigative confusion in the FBI.

; Another plan discussed was the blowing wp-

of every lighthouse in the Bahamas between the U. S.

and Cuba. Another plan mentioned was for the organization
to “rip of f" drug pushers. ‘The above plans were mere Ly
discussed in generalities, .

. HTRAM GONZALEZ wes very concerned about security
of Liga Anti-Commista Cubana. Members of LAC® are nok to.
mencion thet they belong to this organization. The way “
this organization is to be rum is to get small groups | .
together to discuss plans and never to have large meetings.
They feel LACC should infiltrate Alpha 66, an anti-Castro
militant organization with headquarters in Miami, and
other organizations so that -ia effect various orgenizatias
would be carrying out LACC plans, This imfiltration would
take approximatel? § » ¥ months to be put into’ operation.
