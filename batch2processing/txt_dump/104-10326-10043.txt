WILL ENUMERATE THE THE UNFAVORABLE REACTION *
HAD TO RECENT. DISCLOSURES ‘AND AGENCY, REQUESTS FOR PERMISSION TO

WERE ADAMANT ABOUT NOT GIVING PERMISSION TO

= SO MAKE REFERENCE TO A RECENT :
"APPROACH VASKING FOR OUR OKAY IN THEIR ae
DECLASSIFYING SOME OF OUR DOCUMENTS, AND OUR STRONGLY-WORDED — z
RESPONSE DENYING PERMISSION AND ARGUING THAT SUCH DISCLOSURE WOULD
BE A BREACH OF TRUST.
* 4. IN ORDER TO BOLSTER OUR POSITION WITH THE<JFK>BOARD,
REQUEST STATION}OBTAIN A HARD COPY OF THE (_ DEMARCHE] ON
THE DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO JHE MEMO.
WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH HARD COPY EVIDENCE WILL .
BOLSTER OUR ARGUMENT SIGNIFICANTLY. WE ARE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE
ACTUAL TEXT OF THIS (DEMARCHE] IN HOS.
5. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT WE DO NOT WANT EVEN TO
APPROACH ] ABOUT DECLASSIFYING. THE AFOREMENTIONED
DOCUMENTS. WE HOPE OUR MEMO CONVINCES THE BOARD THAT, IN LIEU OF
RELEASING THE DOCUMENTS, SUMMARIES THAT OMIT ALi, REFERENCE
WILL SUFFICE.
$y FYI: OUR FALLBACK POSITION IF THE BOARD TURNS DOWN THE
CONCEPT..OF, SUMMARIES, IS TO MAKE CLEAR ‘THAT WE CANNOT RELEASE THE
DOCUMENT, EVEN IN REDACTED FORM, WITHOUT|
PERMISSION; FURTHER, THAT IF WE SEEK AND ARE DENIED PERMISSION AND
THE BOARD NONETHELESS PROCEEDS WITH THE DECLASSIFICATION, *T WILL
HAVE A TREMENDOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH .THE
IN SUM, OUR GOING-IN POSITION IS WE WANT TO
AVOID RAISING THE SPECTER THAT THE AGENCY MAY
HAVE TROUBLE PROTECTING THEIR SECRETS. iF THE BOARD TURNS DOWN
OUR INITIAL PROPOSAL AND INSISTS WE SEEK(|___—___ PERMISSION TO -
DECLASSIFY, WE WILL DO SO. IN SUCH AN EVE “PEOPLE
‘BELIEVE A STRONGLY-WORDED DOCUMENT FROM THE EFUSING
WOULD PROBABLY PERSUADE THE BOARD NOT TO RELEASE THE
DOCUMENT. WE WILL KEEP YOU ADVISED ON HOW THIS. is
PROGRESSING AND WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER GRIST FOR THE MILL AS

MEMO TO THE BOARD AS WELL AS THE TEXT OF THE

[oT DENARCHE) ON DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION.
