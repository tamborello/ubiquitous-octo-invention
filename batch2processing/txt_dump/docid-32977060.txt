SUBJECT: Report of Progress to Higher Authority

I reported to higher authority the substance

of Mr. Harvey's briefing of the Special Group (Augmented)

on 3 May 1962, pointing out the very limited progress
which has been made and the uncertainty of the ultimate
effectivness of our program. I mentioned the Duque

Project Mongoose, 3 May 1962

PRESENT: General Taylor; Mr. Kennedy; Mr. Johnson; Mr. Gilpatric,
General Decker, General Lansdale and General Craig;
Mr. McCone, and Mr. Harvey

1. General Lansdale gave an interim report on the progress
of stepping up recruitment of Cubans dato the U. S. Army. . He said
the consensus is that there are not more than a thousand suitable
individuals from whom additional recruits could be selected. The
Attorney General commented that the President wishes to have 4 large
number. General Lansdale said that various alternatives for training
of such Cubans are being looked into.

It was agreed that such 4 cadre of Cubans would be an asset
to the U.S., which might be used in a number of ways. General
Lansdale, supported by General Taylor, pointed out that in this
connection the matter of holding the individuals and giving them
useful employment after they are trained is an important and @
difficult one.
