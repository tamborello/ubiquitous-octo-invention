unethical tactics in developing information; Agents cannot -
misuse their credentials; Agents cannot visit trials or other
court hearings merely for the purpose of satisfying personal
curiosity; when testifying as'a witness, Agents are instructed

V : Article in the New York "Daily News," attached, reported
that a top Justice Department official had admitted that FBI Agents follow no
“specific, published, or regular guidelines when they spy on civilians they .
suspect of being trouble makers."" This refers to inquiries being conducted
by the Senate Constitutional Rights Subcommittee. The article further reports
that "the gathering of intelligence on civilians'' was turned over to the
Justice Department, particularly the FBI, following revelations that the
Army had "overstepped its bounds" in gathering intelligence on/cjvilians.

It is further reported that Senator Ted Kennedy was told that thé ¥ ¥BI did

not have any specific regular guidelines to follow, only ''some intéinal
working papers."" Kennedy then told a Justice representative that Justice
efforts fall short in protecting the rights and liberties of the Aniprican people.

The Director inquired "What about this? H,*

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan mo, Le
“T RE: DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GUIDELINES -
ae | , ON INTELLIGENCE GATHERING ACTIVITIES

hy : . . . ~
Concerning the allegation that the FBI assumed
Army's "function" of "spying on civilians," this is not true. You
will recall that the military received wide criticism for their activities
in investigating and compiling files on civilians. As a result, the
Defense Department sharply curtailed military intelligence gathering
activities, This did not increase the Bureau's responsibilities or
activities. We assumed no Army function. As set out above, our
responsibilities are based on Executive Orders and statutes.

While it isi true | that, the Department. of Justice does not
furnish specific published general guidelines.to. the Bureau, it is also
true that the Department does-reyiew. this Bureau's-work. In all cases
information developed by our investigations is furnished to the Department
for its consideration as t2 violation of Federal statutes and possible
prosecution.

Senator Kennedy" s statement shows his animosity to

the Bureau. It implies that the Bureau is "violating the civil rights of
the American people."" This, of course, is utterly without foundation.
