A. BACKGROUND

1. Origin and Development

The Pennsylvania State Police furnished the Pittsburgh FBI
Office a copy of a report dated October 14, 1942, which was
written by Detective JOHN CHRIN, Pennsylvania State Police (PSP),
entitled "Mafia Society's Activities in Labor," in which
Detective CHRIN referred to several prominent Western
Pennsylvania racketeers as members of the Black Hand or of

the Mafia. No evidence is contained in CHRIN's report to

the effect that these racketeers are actually Mafia members,

but merely refers to them as_such.

CHRIN, in his report, also-mentioned the society knew as the
Villa Rosa, beneficial association organized by JACK}@ANCELLIERE ,
a North Side, Pittsburgh; racketeer, and composed of 'a group.of
fellow Sicilians, as~an organization of Pennsylvania Black
Handers. Unverified.allegations have come to the attention

of this office from other sources to the effect that theyi1ie

Rosa Society might be a Black Hand group.

In Detective CHRIN's report, he indicates that in.1942, there ©

_ Pittsburgh and vicinity. .

Ma was never used wyen he was a partner of JOHNALA ROCCA, -_. be

SAMNMANNARINO and FR ATO in a business relationship. He ‘
“gaia that his partners were referred to by everyone, including \
himself, as "Black Handers" and that they employed a group of
Italian toughs who carried out collection duties. “He said
that most of these toughs carried no guns or knives, but were
armed constantly with a twelve inch to fifteen inch cue stick
which they sawed off and weighted with lead. He said that a
hole bored in the end of the sawed off cue stick was filled with
the lead and was then corked. He advised that he carried one
himself for many years and would still have it if he had not
left it in the glove compartment of an automobile he sold. {He
said that this cue stick was given to him by MIKESQENOVESE ,

its original owner, who told him to use it "
He said that during this period the local hoodlums and toughs
had great respect for the power and temper of LA ROCCA who was
