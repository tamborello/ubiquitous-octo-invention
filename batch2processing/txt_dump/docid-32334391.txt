‘ A review of New Orleans indices reveals the following:

New Orleans file 157-981 entitled, “CITIZENS COUNCIL
OF GREATER NEW ORLEANS" reflects that New Orleans telephone
number 242-5500 is listed to PAUL GRAFFIA, Post Office Box
8414, New Orleans. This telephone number carries recorded
messages regarding the integration movement and has been
described as a “hate” number.

New Orleans file 157-555 entitled, “INTEGRATION
OF PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS IN THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW ORLEANS,
LOUISIANA, FALL OF 1962" reveals that on 9/7/62, a meeting
was held at St. Roch Park, New Orleans, which meeting was
comprised largely of persons opposed to integration of
parochial schools in New Orleans.

A 1955 red and white Chevrolet sedan bearing 1962
Louisiana license 181-060 was seen in the vicinity of this
meeting. This car was registered to PAUL A. GRAFFIA, 2463
Dauphine Street, New Orleans.

New Orleans file 100~-0-11021 reveals that one
CHARLES KRAUSE, seaman number E-346466, telephonically
advised the New Orleans Office on 3/21/49, that the "Ziro
Club" was asking too many questions about shipping to and
from New Orleans.

An extra copy of this report is being submitted to
the Bureau for dissemination to Secret Service.

. A copy of this report is being disseminated to OSI,
ONI and ICG; becwhae-of their secondary responsibility with
regard to Klan and hate-type groups.
