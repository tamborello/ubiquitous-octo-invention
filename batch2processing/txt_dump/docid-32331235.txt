CL Jsaia that he has known the subject on a
fairly close basis except for the last three years. He said
he would not classify TOURINE a top echelon hoodlum and
explained this statement by saying that some years ago,
he [~Imade a real killing with a bookmaker in NYC
and was owed a huge sum of money. The bookmaker refused
to pay the PCI and so the difficulty was resolved at the
conference table.. PCI was represented by the subject.

In spite of this, TOURINE did not have sufficient ;
influence to obtain the money for the PCI. PCI added

that he is of the opinion that if TOURINE was regarded

as a top echelon hoodlum, ~ could have forced the bookmaker
to come up with the moneys. \
