Title: SECURITY FOR ROOM 11144

Synopsis: It is requested that OPCA locks be placed on room
11134 and the 3 internal offices within room 11144.

Details: In July 1997, the Historical and Executive Review Unit
(HERU) moved into room 11144 (previously CJIS space). The
adjacent space, room 11134 (CJIS space until 10/1/97) has been
assigned to HERU and the walls will be taken down within the next
several months to create one large work area. Until the
construction changes can made it is requested that the lock to
room 11134 be changed to OPCA keys rather than CJIS keys.

Additionally, 3 internal offices in room 11144 need
their locks changed to OPCA keys.

Three OPCA keys should be made available to Carol
Keeley (Acting Unit Chief), Carl Conner (Acting Supervisor) and
LuAnn Wilkins (Acting Supervisor).
