MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director

VIA: Director
Center for the Study of Intelligence

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: Declassification of JFK Assassination
Records--Status Report

1. This memorandum is for your information. It
provides a status report on the declassification of records
related to the assassination of President Kennedy. We also
note requests from Congress and other agencies to review
their files.

2. Review of documents withheld earlier: We have
completed review of nearly one third of the 10,000 pages
that were initially denied in full. Of those processed thus
far, approximately 95 percent will probably be released.
Declassification of the entire collection should be
completed within several weeks.

3. Declassification of microfilm (150,000 pages): All
of the microfilm has been printed out and organized into
files, and nearly 15 percent has been reviewed. Our target
date for completing review of this material is 1 January
1994.

- One problem is that many of the pages printed
out are virtually illegible, apparently because of the
uneven quality of either the microfilming process or .
the documents that were originally filmed. We are
exploring possible methods of enhancing the printouts
with the Office of Logistics.

4. External requests: We have been requested to
divert personnel to review JFK documents containing CIA-
originated information in several substantial sets of
records outside the Agency. This could have an impact on
the goal of completing review by 1 January 1994.

- SSCI: 65 large loose-leaf binders of Church
Committee and other materials. (At the SSCI's request,
one of our review officers has been detailed to the
Hill for this task.)

- House Committee on Administration: 20,000 pages
of House Assassinations Committee records. (We are.
processing these documents. )

- National Archives: More than 600 tapes of
interviews from the Warren Commission.. (The Archives
is still developing procedures for processing the
tapes.)

- Presidential libraries: We have been asked to
send teams to the Kennedy, Ford, and Johnson Libraries.
(We have deferred this task until the documents
described above have been declassified.)

5. The Presidential Review Board, called for by the
JFK Act, has yet to be appointed. All sanitized documents
are subject to review by the Board, which will have
authority to overrule agencies' determinations as to what
information is to be protected. We expect to have extensive
deliberations with the Board once it is in place.

6. With your approval, we have hired ten additional
contractors to review the JFK documents, and are planning to

bring in several more.
