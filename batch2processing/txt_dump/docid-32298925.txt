The Miami Office by letter dated May 8, 1952,
reported: that Jo Pilcher, Assistant Chief, U.S. Border
Patrol, Miami, advised on May ¢, 1952, that Edward William Murphy,
a pilot; departed from International Airport, Miami, at
4:00 P.M., May 1, 1952, in a plane and that his passengers were
Aureliano Sanchez Arango and Raul Rodriguez Santos. Pilchér stated
that he had learned that Murphy and the two companions were then
en route from Nassau to Caicos Island, which is located about 250
miles east of the Island of Cuba and about 00 miles north of the
Dominican Republic. Pilcher stated that Arango and Santos came
into the United States on March 17, 1952, along with Prio, from a
Mexico, and that he had heard rumors of a nonspecific type to
the effect that Prio and some of his associates are planning a |
revolution to overthrow Batista. . : : i

Pilcher, on May 5, 1952, advised the Miami Office that
the flight plan filed on behalf of Murphy indicated his plane . '
arrived in Nassau at 5:00 P.M. on May 1, 1952 from Miami. Pilcher
reported that the Nassau Civil Aeronautics Authorities observed
the activities of the plane and reported it did not leave until
12:59 P.M., May. 2, 1952, at which time Murphy and his two i
passengers departed for Caicos Island, British West Indies. They
announced to Civil Aeronautics Authorities that they would return
May 3, 1952. According to Pilcher, this plane, piloted by Murphy,

. landed at l:15 P.M., May 2, 1952, at Santiago de Cuba, without.
passengers. It then went to Camaguey, Cuba; on the following
morning and took off from Camaguey at about 11:33 A.M., May 3, 1952,
and arrived at Miami International Airport at 2:00 P.M. on the

same day, without passengers. This plane was met at International
Airport, upon arrival, by Pilcher, who interviewed.Murphy concerning
his passengers, but Murphy refuse Oo answer any questions. ‘

The Miami Office by teletype of May 12, 1952, has
advised that the Immigration and Naturalization Service manifest
on Pan American Airways flight 06 March 19, 1952 reflects that
Jose Luis Francisco Fernandez Espinosa, age 28, a Cuban national,
Livio Hermogenes Peralta Recojo, age 2, a Cuban national, and
Ricardo Florencio Suarez Rodriguez, age 25, a Cuban national,
travelled as a party from Havana, Cuba, to Miami, Florida, and
were all destined ‘to the Leamington Hotel, Miami. These apparently
are the individuals whom M-1 reported went to Miami on March 19,
1952, to confer with former President Prio and from the airline
manifest it appears that M-1, referred to above, is Suarez Rodriguez.
