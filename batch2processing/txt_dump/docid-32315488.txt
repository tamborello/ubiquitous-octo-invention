92- TONY GIACALONE ~ AR °

PCI said he had a meeting with VINCENT MELI ( Frank Meli's
son ) on Friday,6/21/63. In discussing the arrest of TONY GIACALONE,
VINCE had said that it was TONY's egotistical attitude that got
him into his difficulty. According to VINCE, TONY should have been
content to let his lieutenants handle all direct contacts with
police officers, In discussing TONY GIACALONE, VINCE had said that
TONY is very immaculate in his dress and personal appearance and that
it is not unusual in warm weather for him to wear three different
suits in a single day.

PCI is of the opinion that Commissioner EDWARDS has overplayed
the publicity angle in the GIACALONE arrest and he suspects that it
may backfire when the time comes to try GIACALONE, He said his |
epinion is based on the newspaper accounts which apparently carried
details of all of the evidence against GIACALONE,

92- ANGELO MELI ~ AR

PCI said ANGELO MELI recently sold his house on Devonshire.
He is now living near Marine City. He has been having some trouble
With his son in law, fnu, LUCIDO, who married ANGELO's youngest
daughter a year or two ago. Luc ipo reportedly has been drinking
heavily, has been keeping late hours and coming home drunk, and it
had been necessary for ANGELO to have a serious talk with hin.

‘ According to PCI, LUCIDO and his wife had been living at the ANGELO

MELI residence. ANGELO, according to PCI, had bought a bar for
young LUCIDC and he has been operating it. PCI does not know the
name or location of the bar.-

PCI added that. in conversations with FRANK and VINCE MELI it

is apparent they have little respect for BILL BUFFALINO even though
he is married to a daughter of FRANK MELI, PCI stated that one Sunday
about four or five months ago he was at FRANK MELI's home. BILL .
BUFFALINO was there also. PCI said he became extremely bored with
listening to BUFFALINO talking constantly about JIM HOFFA and brag-

ing about how he, BUFFALINO, was such an asset to HOFFA, VINCE °
had remarked to PCI, "You begin to see what we have to put up with."
