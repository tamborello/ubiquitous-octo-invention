This informatfon will not be repeated in view

of the fact it is secondhand information and would be

of no value in any Federa roceedings as testimony, It
is noted that on 12/1/59 JBURTENATIE..te lephoniealiy con-
tacted SA RICHARD B, KELLOGG and advised that he had

 

‘learned from LEOPOLDO ARAGON that the proposed “tavans (7

had taken place on 12/11/59 in the office of I. IRVING
DAVIDSON as scheduled. MIRO had been turned down by
DAVIDSON but would possibly-attempt to go to Nicaragua,
HEURTEMATTE stated that MIRO apparently convinced DAVIDSON
that he was not a communist and was anti-CASTRO. HEURTEMATTE
ommented that this was not tr and stated that he con-
idered MIRO to be worthless, Vfizacon had told HEURTEMATTE
that MIRO usingthe name CARLOS’ VASQUEZ placed rom

DAVIDSON's office to Panama telephone nunber (3-700i%¢ha .
attempt talk with who MIRO Claimed was _
with oracKe) Ss :
ee .
The name of and his identity as a
CIA representative has beén sé orth in the details of

this report to give a complete picture of the activities
of MIRO and also to show hi, odus operandi. It is noted
that the identity of ad-his connection with CIA
is apparently well known as evidenced by the fact that the
information was made available to HEURTEMATTE, DAVIDSON,
and JOSEPH |WEROLA of Miami Beach,.Elorida, through the-
endeavors a conversation of MIRO. It is felt by WFO
that other individuals have elso been apprised of this
information by MIRO in attempts at find backing for an

invasion of Panama, Due tements made by MIRO
concerning the backing by his vasion efforts,
this report will be classi Secret."

The Special Agents who observed ARAGON and MIRO

that SA CONRAD observed DAVIDSON, ARAGON, and MIRO depart
1612 K Street, N.W., at 6:07 p. me, 12/11/59.

Bureau airtel, 12/15/59, instructed WFO to
submit recommendations concerning further investigative
efforts regardinig MIRO. Due to the fact that ARAGON
does not desire to testify for fear of reprisals by MIRO,
it is felt that successful prosecution of the subject
with the information available is doubtful. It is noted
that ARAGON has furnished the only documentary evidence
