SUBJECT: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
PPSAKA
00: DALLAS

Reference New Orleans teletype to Bureau, dated
March 15, 1989; Legat London teletype to Bureau, dated
April 17, 1989; and Dallas teletype to Bureau, dated
April 19, 1989.

A review of numerous volumes of NO 89-69 (Kennedy
Assassination), during the period pertaining to the trial of
CLAY SHAW, failed to disclose MARK MANCINI as a practicing
attorney in New Orleans during the trial. The following
attorneys were noted to represent CLAY SHAW:

 

EDWARD WEGMANN
CHARLES CABIBI
SALVATORE PANZECA

These attorneys maintained offices in New Orleans; however, none
were known to have their offices located in the "French Quarter,"
as alleged by unknown female caller to New Orleans City
Councilman JOSEPH GIARRUSSO, believed to be DEBORAH MILLINGTON.

A review of these files also failed to disclose any
female with the first name of DEBORAH involved in the CLAY SHAW
investigation and trial pursued by the Orleans Parish District
Attorney's Office under then District Attorney JIM GARRISON.

It is noted; however, that in New Orleans teletype to Bureau and
Dallas dated April 6, 1967, DEAN ANDREWS an attorney, who had
been indicted by Orleans Parish Grand Jury for perjury in
connection with District Attorney GARRISON's assassination
investigation, came to FBI, New Orleans Office on April 6, 1967,
and among other information furnished, advised that

Mrs. JEFF HUGG, a former secretary of CLAY SHAW, would reportedly
testify that he (ANDREWS) visited SHAW's office on several
occasions at INTERNATIONAL TRADE MART (presently called WORLD
TRADE CENTER), and picked up envelopes containing money.

Dallas may want to consider interview of MILLINGTON,
identified by Legat London as the probable caller to New Orleans
City Councilman JOSEPH GIARRUSSO, for further details in
referenced information she alleges to GIARRUSSO that an attorney
sent money to LEE HARVEY OSWALD's mother.

New Orleans indices failed to locate any references to
DEBORAH MILLINGTON. .

Inasmuch as no additional investigation remains in the
New Orleans Division, this matter is being placed in an RUC
status. ‘
