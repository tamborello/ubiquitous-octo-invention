CASTRO SUMMONED CUBELA. HE SPOKE TO HIM FOR SEVERAL HOURS, AND
URGED HIM NOT TO BE CONVERTED INTO AN INSTRUMENT OF THE ENEMIES oF
THE REVOLUTION AND THE COUNTRY. FIDEL ALSO TOLD CUBELA THAT BECAUSE
OF CUBELA'S UNSTABLE CHARACTER, HIS FONDNESS FOR AN EASY LIFE, AND
HIS LACK OF CONCERN FOR THE PROBLEMS AND THE STRUGGLES OF THE
PEOPLE, CUBELA ALONE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR RIS INCREASING ISOLATION

OUTSIDE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS. BUT, FIDEL TOLD HIM, IF HE “os
REALLY WOULD CORRECT THIS AND WAS READY TO DEVOTE HIMSELF . 7
