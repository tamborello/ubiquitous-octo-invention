The Revolutionary Government has skillfully maneuvered
Rolando CUBELA, the President of the FEU, and his pro-Communist
cohorts into a position of power. First, on May 7, it was CUBELA
who was given the task of inciting the mob and bruiting the fact
' ) that the powers-that-be disapproved of Aurelaino SANCHEZ Arango.
Commmist 'goon-squad" tactics had become so vicious that even many
students who had heretofore been circumspectly apolitical are afraid
to attend classes. The Vice Secretary of the School of Agronomy asked
how it was that if the CUBELA leadership so deplored violence that it
had remained impassive in the face of the physical violence perpetrated
against his person by members of the Communist Youth from the Instituto
de la Habana, who had entered the University grounds completely armed.
CUBELA and Angel QUEVEDO, went about the campus carrying arms, in
direct violation of the University regulations.
