salary under provis iS Of his MOC until he was terminated:
on 15 October 1963 when the ratline developed by the team

“became | inoperable due to occupation of the target area by.
“.. Soviet technicians, | Another compelling | reason for SANTANA 's
termination stemmed: from his untruthful reporting concerning

certain aspects, of ‘the team operations,

2, In an ‘attempt: to establish positive identification,

JNWAVE obtained a report from the Dade County (Miami)

Sheriff's office that an Emilio SANTANA (no ma tronymic)

‘born 6 July 1936 in. Cuba, was declared a..fugitive from
‘Louisiana on a federal warrant 22 December 1965, FBI Sheet

He. was arrested. and booked by the Dade’ County Sheriff's
office on 2 February” 1966 and was presumably sent back to.

Louisiana, At the time of his arrest SANTANA gave his.

address as 851 SW 4th Street, Miami, which is the same’
address shown ‘on an.old: immigration. frm ‘when he was ~

living in Miami. Headquarters: files indicate SANTANA is
separated from his wife who apparently still resides at - .
the old Miami address. Since SANTANA's date of birth. varies.

. on various documents in his 201 file, the variation in birth!’
date on his arrest. sheet is not conclusive. The fact he —

did give his former address to the arresting officers
indicates he is Emilio SANTANA” Galindo. A. 1962 immigration,
form includes a Photograph which could be obtained: from
JMWAVE: for: identification purposes if this becomes necessary.

3, Although JMWAVE has had no contact with SANTANA
since his. termination, there ig a‘note in Station files
dated 23 June 1964 that SANTANA used the Agency as his-
employer on an auto credit application,

incorporation, these donations would also be used to support
the FRD and the. funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,
less a percentage to be retained by. the FDC, An investi-
gation conducted by a reliable Miami Station asset concluded
that the FDC.was organized strictly for the personal gain

of the promoters with. the approval and collaboration of
ARCACHA. The’ investigation produced no evidence that any
individual donations. were ever solicited or received and
recommended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the
books of the New.Orleans Exporters Company be investigated
for evidence of personal gain and possible evidence of
federal tax evasion, since both the president of the New
Orleans Exporters Company, Gerard F. Tunague, and the Chief.
of New Orleans Stevedores Union, Alfred Chittenden, were
officials of the FDC, Approximately one month after the a
