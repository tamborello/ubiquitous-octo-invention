On Mey’ 5, 1961, “MM T- 1 advised that ‘inasmuch:
as the invasion of: Cuba- by ‘anti=communist rebels on
April- 17,1961 was.a failure; the morale of Cuban revolu=
tionists’ in’Miami°is very low.’ MM°T=1 explained that’ the.
different established Cubam revolutionary “organizations *~
have never recruited Americans; have never taken’ Americans
and, “although these” organizations would accept many ~

donations: of equipment, generally never took Americans
along on proposed, military expeditions.

ween ~ Now there Is no hope of overthrowing the

_ present Cuban Government by military action, consisting —

of only anti-communist Cuban rebels,and Cubans in Miami ~

_are asking for United States and Organization of American

States. intervention. The Cubans feel that they cannot .

- overthrow the Castro Government alone and. are depending

upon outside help. Therefore, recruiting activity has.
ceased and although the Cubans are grateful that indivi-
duals and members of the Anti-Communist Legionnaires
want to help, the Cubans are not interested. MM T-1 said
that’ persons active, in revolutionary activities do not

‘expect Anti-Communist. Legionnaires to leave Miami, parti-

cipate in any action against Cuba and think it will be
only a matter of time umtil the organization dissolves.

MM T-1. explained that'Miami has been a place
attracting all sorts of adventurers and opportunists
and that the Anti-Communist Legionnaires is: just one of -
the many such organizations that have come and gone.

 
  
    
 

Tel. on May 5, 1962 advised that Colonel.
aganova, Miami Beach, Florida, is one of the
leading’ Venezuelan evolutionists in Miami, Florida,
working to overthrow the present government of Venezuela.
Casanova has been contacted by one of the representatives
of the Anti-Communist Legionnaires, has been told of the
training camp the organization has in the Florida Ever-
glades, and Casanova is expected to send a representative .
to inspect the training camp on either May 7 or 8, 1961.
