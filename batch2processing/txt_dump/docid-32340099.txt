Party (PLP) which recently gained control of the
Bahamian Government campaigned on the promise that
if elected they would rid American gangsters from the
Bahamas. :

Commissioner MORRIS will report to the
Commission that the Bahamas Police Force has attempted
to identify the hoodlums allegedly in control of Bahamas
gambling. He will testify that he has caused the
exclusion. of certain gamblers from the casinos and
has failed to accept others who have made application
for employment in the casinos due to their reported
hoodlum influence or criminal records.

appearing in the "Miami News," 3/16/67, and the
“Miami Herald," 3/17/67.
