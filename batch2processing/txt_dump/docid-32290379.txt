had no reports that the ‘Subject had been if’tHat area, He

advised that he would be 2lert to Subject's possible presence
in the area. He said that FRANK SINATRA has not been in
Acapulco to his knowledge and that considered that he would
know because this is generally widely Pea and, in
addition, SINATRA usually contacts him.@w ”

He noted that the Acapulco Towers Hotel supposedly
has been bought by the Gulf and Western conglomerate, .but that
he is suspicious as to the validity of this purchase. He
ye indicated that MOE MORTON remains as Manager of this hotel,

the Subject since before December, 1969, which he considers
to be most unusual, although in part due to his own extended -
absence on leave in the States. In addition, the LERNERs,

Source had a large party on 3-7-70, and was in a
dilemma as to whether or not to ask the Subject. He knew *~ ‘
Subject would hear of the party because he was asking the
LERNERs and Subject's attorney, CASTILLO, and other mutual
friends. He was not adverse to asking the Subject and felt that
the Subject would be hurt not to be invited; however, at the same |"
time, he was inviting the Ambassador and high Embassy officials, -
