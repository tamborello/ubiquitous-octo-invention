Dallas CP took place at the home of AUGUSTIN ESTRADA in West Dallas.
Present were AUGUSTIN ESTRADA, BILL LOWERY and JOE LANDIN.

ESTRADA stated that coming down to business he did not see
any logic in meeting any more. - It was a waste of time for all
involved including the state committee. The Dallas group had not
functioned in more than five years, functioned properly that is.

BILL LOWERY agreed that the party had been at a standstill
for a long time and attributed its shortcomings to the lack of the
group getting together. Through the discussion he insisted that this
was what hd killed the organization. He cited some work he and ©. :
LANDIN had done in different organizations explaming the local CP was
not at a complete standstill. ESTRADA said he was referring to the
CP as a group. The work they had done was on an- individual basis.

Even at that, LOWERY replied the work could be credited to the CP.

ESTRADA stated that he wanted to quit mainly because of
this reason: he had given much thought te what LOWERY said about
protecting his boy. LOWERY’s boy is in the service. In a previous
meeting, LOWERY advieed him Ke definitely did not want to be a
delegate to the State Committee and would no longer attend State
Committee meetings, His boy was in the service and if he (LOWERY)
was ever identified as a big wheel in the CP, he was sure to ruin.
his son’s career, He wowla rather remain just a member, For this
reason, AUGUSTIN stated, hew cowld they stand by and have JOHN STAN=

FORD persecuted = when they as the lecal. CP had not accomplished any
thing, there was no case for it. LOWERY said he still stoced by his
decision if he remains a delegate when the time came for their
exposure as CP members he was sure to be identified as the CP head
of the State of Texas - it had happened to him before, Oncs in the
past he was accused of heading the CP in Texas ~ he and ELWOOD ROSS,
‘they claimed, were the state leaders - not ESTES, LOWERY did not
specify who his accusers were. He asked LANDIN to give his opinion
on the status of the Party. LANDIN said he would continue to work
as usual, He was working on a project now, Before thén he was
working on another one,. He had always managed to keep busy. While
he worked on an individual basis. As LOWERY had said his work could
be credited to the Party. The local CP, LANDIN continued, had not
recruited anyone in years. -He for one had a good number of Marxist
books, pamphlets, etc, He didn't have any use fer them = it was
shameful too for he imagined active CP members could make use of
them. As it was he was going to burn them. LOWERY said he had
sold $8.35 worth of Marxist literature.

 

: He wanted to look through JOE‘'s Marxist litevatre and pick
up some of it he covld sej,l, LANDIN said he could. ;

LANDIN asked what the status of the local CP was. Both
ESTRADA and LOWERY said there was no use deceiving themselves there
wasn't a Party. LOWERY felt the next thing to do was to take the
subject to the State Committee, LANDIN asked fer what, to notify ¢:.
them of AUGUSTIN’s plans or to discuss it. His point was, would —
anything they or the committee say change his mind? ESTRADA said
they were obligated to the State Committee. They had responsibility
and he would in the near future Meet with JOHN STANFORD and would,
after that, contact JOE LANDIN and BILL LOWERY.

DL 134-1A-614A ,

BILL LOWERY reported he had attenliea a couple of meetings
with the Forum, one” a social, where he had neard J, O, GARCIA
speak concerning the dinner-dance honoring Sen... GONZALEZ. |

STANFORD, LANDIN said, had moved and wondered how LOWERY co
him, LOWERY said he called the operator from Dallas, got bis .
number, and called to make sare he would be thers. STANFORD wos
there, ESTRADA said he did not know STANFORD's address or phone |
number and did not know where to call him. If that was so, LANDIN
asked, how could he comtact him to meet with him. ESTRADA said he
would write to another addcess and the letter would be forwarded
to hin.

   
 

 

 

LOWERY said the letter LANDIN weote on Cuba (8/14/61,
"DALLAS TIMES HERALD") was a good one. LANDIN said he regretted
writing it, for while trying to point ovwt the folly of war end the
prejudiced views of seme people, he had done more harm than good.
His wife was terribly upset remembering the hysteria the last
U.S. hijacked plane caused. She pointed out the harm the letter
could do to their children. They would be ostracized or porsecuted
by the children at school,and what of their teachers? She added
that after a letter by LANDIN approved in the pirdéss, some children
(quite sometime ago) that played with their children, never returned
to play again. LANDIN said he had not give it much thought, or
else he would not have written it. LANDIN said his wife also brought

up the question of crack-pots they could harm, and after all they Ae

lived in a corner, next door to them the house was Wacant and an
alley was beht: them, in short they were exposed. LANDIN said
that while others were free to write what they pleased he would not
write letters of that nature any more, AUGUSTIN ESTRADA and BILL
LOWERY said that if they could help in some way they would do it.

 

Informant had no additipnal information.
