available to the National Archives and Records Administration.

Enclosures: Original SA file 105-2886.

Details: By EC dated 03/07/1997 FBIHQ requested San Antonio to
O forward files pertaining to a John Thomas Massen. A search of SA

On 03/10/1997 Debbie Beatty, JFK Task Force, FBIHQ,
advised she had records indicating the SA file number for Massen
