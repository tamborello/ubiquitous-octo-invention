MODESTO LOQUASTO: The informant did not know
with certainty that LOQUASTO was a member; however, he is
a bodyguard of RUSSELL BUFALINO, and he would assume he
was a member.

NICK ALAIMO: Is a close associate of RUSSELL
BUFALINO in the dréss factory business. The informant
believed that he was a member butwas not positive.

Confidential Informant T-3 on January 4, 1954,
furnished substantially the same information as to the
leadership of the Mafia in the Pittston area,

On April 23, 1958, Confidential Informant T-3
advised SA NOAH R. BASS that DOMINIC ALAIMO and JAMES OSTICCO
are controlled by RUSSELL BUFALINO and are the "strongarm
men" of the Mafia, although ALAIMO is not too active as a
strongarm man,

On June 19, 1958, Confidential Informant T-9 ad-
vised that he would consider ALAIMO as the number one man
under RUSSELL BUFALINO in the organization, even though
-ALAIMO does not associate socially with BUFALINO, He further

. advised that he knew of no present illegal activities of the
subject.

On March 28, 1958, Confidential Informant T=11
advised SA FRANK W. MULDERIG he is convinced the purpose
of the meeting at Apalachin, N. Y., on November 14, 1957,
at the home of JOSEPH BARBARA was to take control of the
women's garment industry. He said that LEONARD BLANDINA,
who is a partner of ANGELO SCIANDRA in S & B Sewing Machine
Company which is located in the plant owned by SCIANDRA on
South Main Street, Pittston, Pa., told him that was the
purpose of the meeting, and further, that on other occasions,
he heard NICK ALAIMO and SAMMY DI BELLA, associates of
RUSSELL BUFALINO, discussing the purpose of the meeting
and they, too, in their conversation said that was the pur-
pose of the meeting.

T-11 said the only one who told him directly
the purpose of the meeting was LEONARD BLANDINA, but on
three other occasions he overheard conversations indicat-
ing the above was the purpose of the meeting, and BLANDINA
did not institute or commence such conversations but they
were conversations by ALAIMO and DI BELLA.
