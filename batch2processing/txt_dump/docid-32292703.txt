and Mrs. PAULINO.M. -GUTIERREZ at 1029 S,w, First Ave.; ~
Apt. #4, telephone # 373-2495. PAULINO is also a subject

JORGE GUTIERREZ is'a member. of the Xiglop Corporation,
290 S.w. 8th St., Suites #313-314 and information has been
received reflecting that BOSCH has used this office for.
Cuban Power purposes prior to his recent establishment of ©
_an office in the same building. The telephone numbers of
the Xiglop Corporation are 379-9555 and 379-9556.

JORGE GUTIERREZ has a girlfriend who is the daughter
of ROLANDO PEREZ, 6350 S.W. 19th Terr., telephone #667-7683
and he frequently drives an automobile registered to PEREZ;

_ It is therefore believed that long distance tele-
phone calls charged to the above-mentioned numbers may
reveal significant evidence concerning the whereabouts of
GUTIERREZ and other defendants in this case at the time the
bomb was placed on the "Lancastrian Prince’ and at the time
the explosion occurred on the "Coromoto".

It has recently been established through information
provided by OSCAR ANGULO REYES, PSI-UD, that the hooded’
"Ernesto" conference held in Miami-on -9/19/68, was at the
hibme of EDUARDO MAURI, 3949 S.W. 75th Ave., telephone #226-
9928. It-has also been ascertained that MAURI is in close
association with BOSCH and shares his confidence. It is
believed that MAURI‘s telephone could very likely be used
in communications by the BOSCH group on bombing Projects .gh(\}

UACB, Miami, will obtain a subpoena for the toll
records on the above named telephone numbers to be served on
the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company to cover
