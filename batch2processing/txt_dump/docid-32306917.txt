FRATIANNO claimed to informant that he received
assurances from JACK DRAGNA that this would be done.

Instead, according to FRATIANNO, this was not done.
His wife did not receive any appreciable proceeds from "those
things I had going for me." His wife, JEWEL, was told by the
DRAGNAs that she would "be taken care of" through "HAPPY"
MELTZER. According to FRATIANNO, JEWEL was given a pittance,
$50 or $75 a week through MELTZER--and this for only a few
months.

When JEWEL FRATIANNO continued to object, after a
few months, MELTZER, according to FRATIANNO, told her that
nothing remained of FRATIANNO's operation and that she was
making a "pest" of herself in continuing to come to him.

FRATIANNO then noted that when he finally got out of
prison, that it was LOUIS TOM DRAGNA that had a legitimate
business in the garment industry in Los Angeles. He also
noted that it was now "HAPPY" MELTZER that had the “most going
for him'"--taking cuts from bookies and being involved in money
loaning deals. He pointed out that MELTZER had always "fronted"
for the DRAGNAs and that they were sharing in MELTZER's
operations.

FRATIANNO took the position, according to informant,
that the operation he (FRATIANNO) had once developed had been,
in effect, taken over by the DRAGNAs and their associate,
MELTZER.

Both FRATIANNO and BOMPENSIERO then told informant
that BOMPENSIERO, too; had a profitable operation going in
San Diego prior to his imprisonment and this operation had
been allowed to dissipate and disintegrate and he, too, had
been "let down" by the 'family."

FRATIANNO and BOMPENSIERO then indicated to informant
that the reasons they had been making their inquiries with
SAM LAZES, WILLIE ZEVON, ELI LUBIN, GEORGE GORDON, etc., was
to ascertain the nature and extent of theqerations of the
DRAGNAs and MELTZER.

. FRATIANNO and BOMPENSIERO then told informant that
they had discussed this matter at some length with JCHN
ROSSELLI. They had not, as yet, made any move and did not
intend to make any move until such time as they ascertained
more specifics relative to the operations of MELTZER.

After they develop the information they want,
FRATIANNO and BCM°ENSTZRO told informant that they intend to
contact "Boss" FRANK DESIMONE and request a "meet" with LOUIS
TOM and THOMAS F. DRAGNA. They intend to confront them with
what they referred to as the "shabby treatment" they received,
the facts relating to what FRATIANNO considers as an "insult"
to his wife by MELTZER, and demand some sort of redress.

Before BOMPENSIERO and FRATIANNO left, they again
requested informant to treat their conversation in the strictest
of confidence. They asked informant to be alert to any
information relating to the operations of MELTZER and the
DRAGNAs and to relay such information to them on the occasion
of their next contact.

Informant noted that both FRATIANNO and BOMPENSIERO
have gone to some lengths to re-establish close and regular
contact with him. Both continue to be insistent that informant
visit them at their respective residences whenever he might .
find it convenient to do so. Part of the reason, according
to informant, is the fact that neither BOMPENSIERO nor
FRATIANNO have the contacts. that informant has in the Los
Angeles area. Informant is in a position to know certain
information desired by both of them. Informant has the phone
numbers and means of contact with various individuals in this
area that neither BOMPENSIERO nor FRATIANNO have. In addition,
informant, BOMPENSIERO, and FRATIANNO all have close, long-
standing identity with JOHN ROSSELLI.

Informant stated. that it is his opinion that
BOMPENSIERO and FRATIANNO are slowly and cautiously making a
pid for a shift of leadership in which one or both would be
identified in the Los Angeles "Brugad." Informant emphasized
that this was only his opinion--it was not based on direct
statements made by BOMPENSIERO or FRATIANNO, but rather on
indirect statements. They are openly critical of men like
"Capos" JOSEPH ADAMO and ANGELO POLIZZI and even "Under-boss"

; Before informant left for Los Angeles on the night
of 12/5/65, BOMPENSIERO again told him that he was definitely
going to Mexico City n Monday, 12/6/65. He again stated
that he would be gone most of this week, but that sometime after
his return he would come to Los Angeles to meet with JOHN
ROSSELLI. BOMPENSIERO told informant that he would plan on
meeting with informant also when he was in the Los Angeles
area. .

While informant was with FRATIANNO and BOMPENSIERO
on the morning of 1/18/66, they discussed the following matter
with informant, requesting him to treat it in the strictest
of confidence.

Both BOMPENSIERO and FRATIANNO spoke in extremely
critical and profane terms of HAROLD "HAPPY" MELTZER and
LOUIS TOM DRAGNA and his father, THOMAS F. DRAGNA. FRATIANNO,
in particular, was quite bitter in his comments.

FRATIANNO reminded informant that prior to his
(FRATIANNO's) imprisonment in the mid-1950s, he had always
been close to the DRAGNAs, particularly JACK DRAGNA (deceased
"Boss") and had always been fair in his dealings with them.
Prior to his imprisonment, FRATIANNO noted that he had been a
"Capo." FRATIANNO reminded informant that the "regimes" led
by him (FRATIANNO ) and BOMPENSIERO had been the two most
“active” regimes in the entire Los Angeles "Family." JACK
DRAGNA had always been “cut in" to all their operations and
this had always been a highly prosperous association.

FRATIANNO then noted that, during that period, he
"had a lot going." He again reminded informant that, at that
time, he had "cut into” numerous bookies and gambling figures
in the Los Angeles area, that he had set up a "piece" of a
legitimate business for himself in the garment industry in
Los Angeles, and that his operation had been highly prosperous.

When he went to prison in the mid 1950s , according to
FRATIANNO, it was the responsibility and duty of “Boss" JACK
DRAGNA to see that his (FRATIANNO!s) operation was handled for
him and that the proceeds from this operation be given to his
wife, JEWEL FRATIANNO. Even without a successful operation,
it was still the duty of DRAGNA to see that his wife, JEWEL,
was "taken care of."

BOMPENSIERO again told informant he would be in
Mexico City for most of the week. He also stated that he
(BOMPENSIERO) intended to come to Los Angeles to see JOHN
-ROSSELLI some time soon after his return to Mexico City and
at that time he would contact informant s0 they could also
get together while BOMPENSIERO was in Los Angeles.

BOMPENSIERO then stated that DESIMONE was afraid
to make a real decision on his own and always discussed such
matters with JOHN ROSSELLI. He would then respond as ROSSELLI
suggested. BOMPENSIER@ then said that the "real Boss"
actually is JOHN ROSSELLI.

Informant noted that normally such comments from i
BOMPENSIERO would be highly dangerous. However, according 1
to informant, ROSSELLI is the real power in this area, and :
BOMPENSIERO is closely associated with ROSSELLI. In addition,
informant pointed out, before his imprisonment, BOMPENSIERO
had been a ranking LCN "member" in Southern California and
has highly placed, ranking LCN friends throughout the country.

It is noted that informant has previously identified
the Brown Derby Restaurant in Beverly Hills, California, as '
a "meeting place” used by FRANK BOMPENSIERO as well as JOHN
ROSSELLI. Informant has also previously furnished specifics
relative to several "meets" held or planned to be held at
this restaurant between ROSSELLI and BOMPENSIERO.

In this same connection, informant advised that
during the course of his discussions with FRANK BOMPENSIERO
in San Diego on 12/4-5/65, BOMPENSIERO made several references
to the fact that he continued to meet with JOHN ROSSELLI on
about a weekly basis.

BOMPENSIERO then told informant that he and ROSSELLI
‘had changed their "meeting place" as "We can't use the Brown
Derby anymore. It's no good anymore. We have to set up a new
place.

BOMPENSIERO did not tell informant why this "meeting i
place" was no longer being used by him. From the remarks he |
made, however, informant was of the impression that he had not |
finalized details and specifics of a new "meeting place."

To this LUIGI MERLI commented to informant, "maladrino,
maladrino," which, according to informant in Italian means
"at top, has proven self, belongs." He was referring to
BOMPENSIERO.

BOMPENSIERO said that he has to meet "GIOVANNI"
early this morning (12/6/65) to talk to him about this matter
and, since he had to catch a plane for Mexico City at 10:00 AM
from San Diego, he will meet GIOVANNI “half way" (between
San Diego and Los Angeles). ~ :

BOMPENSIERO also stated that he still meets "GIOVANNI"
every week "but it's no good where we were before" (Brown.
Derby in Beverly Hills because he and FRATIANNO were shaken
down in there by Los Angeles Police Department Intelligence
recently). He stated that they are looking for a new place
to meet.

On 11/17/65 informant advised that on the night of
11/16/65 FRANK BOMPENSIER#’ had contacted informant to
arrange a meeting with him. On the night of 11/16/65, informant
met with FRANK BOMPENSIERO and JAMES "THE WEASEL" FRATIANNO
at the Villa Capri Restaurant in Hollywood, California.

On this occasion, both BOMPENSIERO and FRATIANNO
spoke freely to informant of the fact that they were partners
along with FRANK LA PORTE of Chicago in the Fratianno trucking
companies. They both also mentioned that they are in regular
contact with JOHN ROSSELLI and that ROSSELLI also has some
sort of interest in this trucking operation. Informant noted
that this was the first time that BOMPENSIERO and FRATIANNO
had, personally, stated this fact to informant. Informant
had been advised by JOSEPH LIMANDRI and "Capo" JOSEPH ADAMO
in San Diego that BOMPENSIERO, FRATIANNO, and LA PORTE were
associated together in the Fratianno trucking companies;
however, neither BOMPENSIERO nor FRATIANNO, themselves, had
previously made this statement to informant.

On 12/4/66 BOMPENSIERO also told informant that he
had recently been contacted by the "Boss" of the Detroit
"Brugad," JOSEPH ZERILLI. ZERILLI, according to BOMPENSIERO,
is an LCN "commissione" member. According to BOMPENSIERO,
ZERILLI did not have BOMPENSIERO's telephone number as he had
moved a couple of times within recent months. ZERILLI called

a contact of his in El Centro, California (not further identi-
fied). This individual called "Capo" JOSEPH ADAMO in San
Diego and requested ADAMO to contact BOMPENSIERO and ask
BOMPENSIERO to call ZERILLI. ADAMO was given a telephone
number at which ZERILLI could be. reached.

BOMPENSIERO stated that he did call ZERILLI whom he
has known for years. BOMPENSIERO told informant that ZERILLI
said to him, "FRANK, will you do me a favor--I would like
you to take care of something for me." BOMPENSIERO stated that
he ‘then told ZERILLI that he was no longer a "Capo" but only a
"soldier" and that this matter would probably have to be
cleared with his "Boss" FRANK DESIMONE and his "Capo" JOSEPH
ADAMO. ZERILLI then told BOMPENSIERO, "Don't worry about
them, I'll handle anything that comes up." BOMPENSIERO said
he then told ZERILLI that he would give the matter some thought
and would recontact him.

BOMPENSIERO told informant that he desired to discuss
this matter with JOHN ROSSELLI and was going to try to see
ROSSELLI, if possible, before he (BOMPENSIERO) left for Mexico
City on 12/6/65.

BOMPENSIERO did not discuss further specifics of
this matter with informant nor was it possible for informant
to ask any further questions in connection with it.
BOMPENSIERO did, however, indicate that ZERILLI's request
related in some way to an LCN matter.

On 12/6/65 informant advised that he had dinner at
the BOMPENSIERO residence on the night of 12/5/65. BOMPENSIERO
told informant that he had not been able to get in touch with
JOHN ROSSELLI for the past several days. He had learned, he
claimed, that ROSSELLI had returned to the Chicago, Illinois,
area sometime after the death of MURRAY HUMPHRIES and did not
know if he had returned to the Los Angeles area.

On 12/5/65 BOMPENSIERO told informant that he wanted
to see ROSSELLI about the "ZERILLI matter" if possible before

he left for Mexico City and would leave for Mexico City either
the morning or the night of 12/6/65.

advised that ROSSELLI is one of the ranking members of LCN
but belongs to the Chicago "Brugad." According to this
source, R@SSELLI is one of the most powerful men in the
"organization" on the West Coast and handles interests of the
Chicago "Brugad"” in Las Vegas, Nevada.

On 3/4/64 this source advised that ROSSELLI is one
of the most powerful and influential men in LCN. He is
considered one of the sharpest and most intelligent men in this
organization. He is highly respected and frequently consulted
relative to and handles matters of highest importance and
greatest delicacy. He was a member of the Los Angeles "Brugada"
but later transferred to the Chicago "Brugad."

On 2/16/65 LA 4448-C-TE advised that FRANK
BOMPENSIERO was the "Capo Regime” in charge of the San Diego
group of LCN some years ago. When he was sentenced to state
prison in about 1955, he was succeeded in this post by
ANTHONY MIRABILE, who held this post until his death in
December, 1958. This post is now held by JOSEPH ADAMO. Source
advised that BOMPENSIERO is presently a "soldier" in the San
Diego "Capo Regima."

LA 4412-C-TE furnished the following information
yy ee a@ conversation he had with FRANK BOMPENSIERO on
12 5:

BOMPENSIERO stated that although they (LCN) must
ask the "boss" before moving into anything, he does not have
respect for. FRANK DESIMONE and therefore he will ask only one
man, "GIOVANNI" (JOHN ROSSELLI).

Using the Italian language, BOMPENSIERO stated that

_the "Boss" called him from Detroit not too long ago and asked
him to do him a favor commenting, "I know that you can do it.”
BOMPENSIERO said he told him that, "I ain't nothin'...only a
soldier" but the "Boss" said, "I didn't go the other route
(through ADAMO, LICATA, or DESIMONE), I want you to handle this."
BOMPENSIERO said he told him he would be glad to do it if he
can. BOMPENSIERO said, "You don't know how happy I've been
since that call. I don't have to ask ADAMO, the 'blind guy'
(DESIMONE), or the 'cigar' (LICATA)...only one guy I have to
clear with...GIOVANNI (ROSSELLI)."
