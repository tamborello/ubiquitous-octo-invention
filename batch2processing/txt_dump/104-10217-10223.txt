Medical Staff feele that] made a surprisingly fast recovery and seems
well on the way to complete health, However, the hospital report (2 quick transla-
tlen of which inte English is attached for your ready reference), dated as it is, still
reflects some inconclusive levels in the results of the various chemical tests shown.
Undoubtedly these have by now been lowered to completely safe levels, since

2. Interme of our operational utilization of LS at this time,
while they reserve finite comment until all the returne (per above) are in, the
Medical Staff did stress the paramount importance roper rest and of net over-
taxing the strength of the agent, coupled with his strict adherence to regular,
warm, balanced meals in accordance with the dietary restrictions usually imposed,
and complete absence of alcobol, in order to prevent a relapse. So long 2s these
caveats are adhered to, however, there is no reason why he could not make some
more short trips during the next few months, if necessary. However, since he
alse has an office to set up and we would like him to concentrate on the
offer, perhaps it would be a good idea to keep those trips to a minimam for the
time being.

     
      
 

3. The Medical Staff will be glad to review any further chemical tests per
para, 1 above suggestions, or any others which his doctor may have already run.

1. After considering several alternatives and given [firs
lack of financial forward planning, LCPIPIT believes that it would
be beneficial and advantageous for WOFIRM to offer to subsidize a
portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both
life insurance and a cash value toward retirement. We have dis-
eussed this with yu and he has agreed to the desirability of
such a program. He is willing to participate in such an arrangement
and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him.

We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals
which he has received from the local representative of a reputable
WOLADY insurance firm.

       
        
      
     
      
          
 
 
      
       
    
    

 

 

p

2. LCPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the
cost of a life insurance program for{_____¥l. (This WOPIRM portion
not to exceed $50 per month.) Prom an administration standpoint
this would merely take the form of an increased monthly payment and
we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were
indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.

Or. 24 October 1968, I saw Dr. Dely of the Blo-shenissry
Laboratory _of Bospital for

tests. ; Dr. Hodes, sent me to Daly as
a private patient, as practice is not to taxe these
tests unless the patient's condition seems to be worsening.
5 thousnt I showed no signs of a recurrence of

md the normal practice would have been, at most,
for me to have bean examined ty the specialist at the
hospital, who tight then decice to asx for the tests.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Daly said that all required tests, exceot the

would be done. He said he thoucht the __ | unecessary
wiless the others indicated negative factors. In whicn
ease, he said he would ask me to come in again for that-
test.

 

  
 

Daly will. send me the_results of the tests and his bill
c/o American Express,[ _—s|within a week.
