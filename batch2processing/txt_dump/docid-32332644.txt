FESSLER advised that the home purchased and fur-
nished by SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA for the couple in the
North Hills section of Pittsburgh, which is located on
Guenevere Drive, has been sold by LA ROCCA, and that this
sale ostensibly included some of the furniture and fixtures
in the home in addition to the carpeting and drapes. He
understands that the adopted son of LA ROCCA is -endeavoring
to transfer his Junior college credits to a bona fide four
year educational institution, and has applied at such places
as the University of Miami, Duquesne University, the Univer -
sity of Pittsburgh, and California State Teachers College
in California, Pa. He has no idea what he wants to do in
the future, but is being constantly badgered by his father
who wants him to obtain a college degree. FESSLER person-
ally helieves that the boy is not intelligent enough to.
satisfactorily pass his grades in this regard. .

 

FESSLER further “advised that his daughter is
presently unemployed, but is seeking some king of employ-
ment in the reception field so that she may be able to .
further support her young son and the elder FESSLERS with
whom she plans to live.

 

; He has gained the impression that she has been
completely brainwashed by the LA ROCCA family and that she
no longer has any respect for law enforcement authorities
and the FBI in particular. He does not believe she would
furnish any information whatsoever concerning her relation-
ship with the adopted son of LA ROCCA or with any of the.
members of the LA ROCCA family. He pointed out that she
has been extremely evasive in answering questions that he
has asked her and he believes an’ interview by the FBI would
have a similar effect. He added that the elder LA ROCCA
‘has given his blessing to the divorce and feels that it is
probably better for all concerned. |

He understands that LA ROCCA has advised his
adopted son to remarry as soon as he locates another girl -
who is to his liking and that he will finance any obliga-
‘tions brought about by his son's involvement with other
women .

nad definitely concluded that he Was through operating

gambling casinos*‘arter his Jockey Club at Chester, W. Va.,
was closed by Special Agents of. the FBI during February, ;
1963. TEEMER believed that he had enough money to carry

unexplained pressure, however, which this informant
attributes to "The Italian Syndicate," TEEMER was forced

to reopen a gambling casino known as the "Red Dog." The
informant advised that in this new operation, everything

is being done by TEEMER to comply with instructions issued
by the United States District Court, which arose out of the
trial of TEEMER and others in connection with the Jockey
Club. »He noted that each employee working at the "Red

Dog" has been forced to move physically to Chester, W. Va.,
and that the establishment has its bank account at Chester,
He said TEEMER has insisted that all employees of the

Clubd go home for family visits only on their days off.
