ANTI-RACKETEERING

In view of the highly confidential nature of the source
from whom we have obtained information relating to the captioned
matter, it is recommended that a new 92~classification file be
opened and maintained in the Confidential File Room,

Briefly, it is alleged that Frank Chavez, Secretary-
Treasurer of Teamsters Local 901, San Juan, Puerto Rico, attempted
to shake down the owners of four hotels in San Juan, As a result
of this the owner of one of the hotels reportedly gave unknown

 

\ members of the criminal element in New York a "contract" to kill ,
3 Chavez; however, this matter reportedly was’ resolved peacefully”
at a later date. It is noted that attempts by Chavez to shake
X down hotel owners may constitute violations of the Anti-Racketeering
4 Statute.
