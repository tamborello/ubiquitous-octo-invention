1. LIFEAT of 9 February 1967 reports that Soviet Press
Attache Nikoiay Sergeyevich LEONOY (201-152159) asked the.
printer of the Soviet Information Bulletin in Mexico, Jose
HERNANDEZ Azorin, to make up “the same list we did for Chile,
but for the Colombian addresses." Azorin said that he would have
the list ready in ten days and send it (to Moscow).

 

2. The above probably means that the names and addresses
of Chilean subscribers to the Bulletin printed in Mexico were
sent to Chile when the Soviets started their new magazine there.
It thus appears that the Sovicts may now be about to put out
a magavine in Colonbia and that the Colombian addresses on file
in Mexico will similarly be sent to Colombia.
