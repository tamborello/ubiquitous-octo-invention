Dear Bob:

Forwarded herewith are our comments on the draft report
on DeMonrenschildt.

Page 1. Phrase "not tied to any intelligence agency.’
Covers both domestic and foreign. Did not Warren Commission
say no evidence of Soviet, etc? Imprecise as written.

Page 15A. Moore was assigned in 1948 to predecessor organi-
gation of DCD. :

The job de scription is froma classified document. I believe we
took exception before with citing Moore's job description. It is not
essential to the story. Why not say that his duties in Dallas were
contacting individuals in his area who had information on foreign

subjects.

Page 15B. Delete titles or descriptions of reports. ‘That reveals
specific interests. Delete all after Yugoslavia, at end of second

line, paragraph 36.

Page 18. Délete reference to Jerry Brown. Use descriptive
phrase. Request delete reference to Office of Security. Also delete
Gale Allen. He was a CIA employee with an organization acronym for
which was DODS (not Deb, for De martment of Defense). Also in

following quotation.
Paye 19. Delete Czaikowski's name. Incidentally, he was on
the Georgetown faculty (night teaching).

Paye 25\. Delete "by Robert Gottschling-" |
