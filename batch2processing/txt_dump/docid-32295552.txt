up some "stuff" and then going to NYC, adding, "It's
ali set. I'm kideaping D'ALESSANDRO." [When PIATKOWSK
mentioned fhe had been unable to locate UEL FONDE
during past few days, GARCIA[said "To hell with FONDEUR
I've made different arrangements". It is noted({FONDEUR

GARCIA indicated to PIATKOWSKI he would make necessary
contacts in New York and asked PIATKOWSKI to see if he
could get the "contact number" im NYC as he had lost it.
PIATKOWSKI said GARCIA apparently wc[by ¥ assum vee) had

by UR

 

been given a "contact number" in NYC FONDE

Later that evening PIATKCOWSKI said GARCIA had
not yet left Miami but voiced intention to do so that
night. On 12/6/60 PYATKOWSKI said GARCIA still in Miami,
but still fndicating intent to leave for NYC. PIATKOWSKI
said he inquired of FRANCISCO MALDONADO IGLES sRPErson
who originally(put him in contact with FONDE about a

"contact number" im NYC and MALDONADO said hé did not know
name or number of contact, but contact supposed to be at

in Miami to set up sale of arms for DOMINICK BARTONE,
Cleveland, Ohio, who was previously convicted im Customs
case in matter imyolving illegal shipment of arms to DR.
GARCIA voluntarily told FICKIE he had been <to_ at
expense of DR(with FONDE nd while there waséffered
$100,000.00 to’deliver D'ALESSANDRO to DR. He said idea -
was discussed that D'ALESSANDRO might be lured to DR

by getting him to lead an expedition against DR which
would be trapped by DR in which event reward might go as
high as $150,000.00. GARCIA said he did mot like idea
and had backed owt of it but volunteered to do anything
he could to help U. S. When asked by PICKIE if he could
get back "in" with persons behind plan, GARCIA indicated
he probably could. FICKIE believed GARCIA intended to
get back "in" through FONDEUR. .

It would appear that since GARCIA has discussed
this matter with FICKIE he is not likely to engage in any
kidnaping plot cf D'ALESSANDRO, but is possibly now talk~

mg as he inkeefort to regain the confidence of
Goetoicand a effort to assist. PICKIE. FICKIE indicated

e felt it would interfere with his operation if GARCIA

is interviewed by FDI. He indicated he hoped that through
GARCIA he could uncever the operations of BARTONE and
BARTONE's associate iu Miami, EDWARD BROWDER, who has been
previously involved in matters of interest to Customs.
FICKIE said he would keep Miami advised of any information
concerning matter of D'ALESSANDRO. ;

Ia wiew of above, Miami does not contemplate
interview of GARCIA at this time, and will maintain
contact with PIATKOWSKI in this matter.
