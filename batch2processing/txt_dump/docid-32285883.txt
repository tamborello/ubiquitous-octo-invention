WEEKLY SUMMARY

 

 

WILLIAM KENNEY, Departmental Attorney, advised he had
been informed by IRWIN POTTS that the Miami Herald newspaper is
presently planning to conduct its own investigation to attempt
to prove there is corruption among local law enforcement officials.

Sgt. JAMES I. MINIX, "Special Squad", Miami Police
Department, advised on July 18, 1962, there was wide spread corrup-
tion among the old "hard core" officials in the Miami Police De-
partment. He stated that prior to two years ago the city of Miami
had been divided into districts with a lieutenant in charge of the
district. Each lieutenant had his own "bag man" and controlled
vice in his particular area. Now, according to MINIX, the city no
longer is divided into police districts and each lieutenant or (

 

captain, as the case may be, is in business for himself so that
there is no organized payoff as such anymore.

On July 19, 1962, MM 609-C advised he had heard that
MOE ROCKFELD, FBI #296641, who was recently released from Raiford
Prison, and MONTE GARDNER, formerly associated with the Gaiety
Night Club in Miami had left the city within the past week and
were to go to Charleston, South Carolina, where they planned to
open a gambling club.
