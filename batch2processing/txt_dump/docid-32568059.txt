ALL FOL INFORMATION CONTAINED

ad SHOT: HAVEL’ TO CUBA - 8 USC 1185 (pb) HEREIN (8 UNCLASSIFIED .
: UaIt P= Gah GMOS

cules Pursuant to the conversation between Mr. W. R. Wannal of
your Bureau and Mr. John H. Davitt of this Division, there follows —
a listing of individuals who have allegedly traveled to Cuba
without bearing a valid passport. Information concerning their
travel has been made available to us through Federal Bureau of
Investigation investigative reports and memoranda.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

- Representative Francis E,. Walter, Chairman of the House
Committee on Un-American Activities, recently requested this
Department to make available to his Committee information con-
cerning persons who have traveled to Cuba in apparent defiance
of the State Department's travel ban. You may recall this subject
was commented upon by the President at a recent press conference.
: In considering what information can be revealed to the Committee
without coupromising confidential sources or interfering with
pending or contemplated investigations, we have tentatively con-
- Gluded that we should not make available to the Committee at this
“time the names of any persons whose travel is curgintly being
investigated by the Bureau or whom we anticipate requesting you
“to investigate. Likewise, we do not now plan to furnish the
Committee the name of any person where the only source of infor~
mation as to his travel was confidential.

 

 

However, we are considering the feasibility of furnishing
t Committee names, and certain identifying data, in all cases
oyWhere no investigation is pending or contemplated and where the
source of information as to the travel is not specifically
identified as being confidential. Information in this category.
: has come to the Bureau, in the main, from friends and relatives
© of the subjects, from domestic and foreign steamship lines, and
- from statements of the subjects to the Immigration and Naturali-
zation Service, to the Swiss Legation in Havana, Cuba, and before.
Where the name of a traveler is to be furnished _
