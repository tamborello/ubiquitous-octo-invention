It is to be noted that the Franco-Chinese Association
of Friendship mentioned in referenced LHM is probably
identical with the Association of Franco-Chinese Friends
described on page two, paragraph three, of the SDECE report
of 11/10/67. It is further to be noted that JOSEPH MARCHISIO
is described as the treasurer of this Association. HELENE
MARCHISTIO, mentioned in referenced, LHM, is probably the wife
or a relative of this individual. @) :

As additional pertinent information is received —
from the DST or the SDECE,} the Bureau and interested offices
will be advised. . )
