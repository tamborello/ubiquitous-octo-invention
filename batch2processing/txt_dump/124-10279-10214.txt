ure LANGELLE stated that he knew PRISCILLAYPOS HNSON
and ROBERT WkGEBSON by face,but never associated with them”
in Russia. -He recalls that he may have talked to GIBSON in
a general security orientation session before GIBSON reported
the Soviet approaches? e explained that he had this security
ession with GIBSON bécause GIBSON's wife was quite attractive
; and had departed Russia leaving GIBSON a_bachelor in Moscow.
Ae LANGELLE thought that GIBSON might be a target for the
Russians in view of the fact his-wife-had left him a bachelor
because of marital troubles. LANGELLE does not recall that
GIBSON mentioned anything concerning SOCHUREK or any. other
correspondents during the security orientation session X%¢7

LANGELLE explained that he exercised no, authority
over any Americans who were not employed at the United States
Embassy. He said that he could not order these people to do
or to refrain from doing anything. He could only talk to
them informally at their own volition. Therefore, he was
unable to call in SOCHUREK for an interview even if he had
desired to do so. u)

LANGELLE advised that he did not receive a reply
to his 8/14/59 letter to the Department of State and he
thought that if he had received a reply he would remember
it. He had no knowledge what, if any, action was taken by
the State Department upon receipt of his letter. He was

- sure a copy of his letter reached CIA through the Security
Office of the State Department () (a)

or RICHARD DAVIS was the Counselor at the United States
Embassy in Moscow and since he, THOMPSON, usually talked to
his Counselor, he may have told DAVIS about the Soviet ;
approach to SOCHUREK. Ambassador THOMPSON believed that --::
