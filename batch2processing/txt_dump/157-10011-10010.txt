OCCURRENCE? ny, Special Group heard Mr. Merchant state his opinion that the only

solution is to move the Guatemalan train activities to the United States even though
the U. S. could probably not get away with this either. A number of alternative

base sites for the training of the Cu was considered both in the United States,
in Puerto Rico, or in the Panama Canal zone. Mr. Douglas
felt the "U. S.-Gapability for Intervention in Cuba will probably not be effective

enough unless there is more overt participation than has been contemplated to date...
"Mr. Grey supported this general position, stating that when the current Cuban

plan was approved, the situation in that country was different than it is now.

Since then, the Cubans have received sizeable amounts of bloc arms and have or-
ganized a malitia. Mr. Gray wondered how a few hundred exiles could be."

"Mr. Mann expressed the opinion that the way to proceed is to seal Cuba off from

the rest of Latin America and settle down for a one- or two-year wait..."

OCCURRENCE:

Lansdale states, "On October 30-31 for an 'Eyes Only' back~
ground memorandum requested by Rosgwell Gilpatric, information was requested
from CIA on the current status of all operations. CIA reported all militant
operations have been ordered held at a stop, although the volatile Cubang
were frustrated and not under complete control. The Matahambre operation

mene was not mentioned by the CIA in reporting in operational teams inside Cuba, oo

 

although I asked for specifics on militant teams inside, Two action teams oe
CIA reported as being inside Cuba were described as in place only collecting
intelligence, not actions, (sabotage,etc.)*
