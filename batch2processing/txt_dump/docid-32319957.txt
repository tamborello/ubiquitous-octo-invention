: ‘ INFORMAL NOTE - NOT FOR RETENTION

May 6, 1996

Director Freeh:

Tomorrow, 5/7/96, the JFK Task Force (JFKTF) will
transfer an additional 16,679 pages of JFK documents to the
National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The
transfer will bring the total number of pages sent to NARA to
641,128.

Tomorrow's transfer will consist of files reviewed by
~-~~the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) as it
explored various assassination conspiracy theories. The files
include those on organized crime figures Angelo Bruno, Gabriel
and Sam Mannarino, as well as other persons of interest to the
HSCA, most notably Maurice Lerner, John Orion Pittman, and Thomas
Eli Davis.

Of the 16,679 pages transferred today, 4,404 contained
postponed information ranging from one word or item on a page to
more extensive postponements. Ninety-one were withheld because
the FBI postponed them in their entirety. There were another
five pages withheld in their entirety because they contained IRS
information, the release of which is prohibited by the Act.
Another 256 pages were withheld because the FBI is awaiting word
from another government agency or a foreign government as to
whether their contents can be released. ;

Many of the postponements in the files to be released
tomorrow were taken to protect sensitive sources, particularly
those who provided information regarding organized crime
activities. Other postponements involved grand jury. material
that has not been unsealed. The FBI will work with the
Department of Justice to have grand jury records made public .
where appropriate, and take other steps to reduce the amount of
postponed materials in these files, as part of its continuing
effort to maximize disclosure of information in its JFK records.
