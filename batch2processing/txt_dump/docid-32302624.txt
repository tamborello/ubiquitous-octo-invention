INFORMANT PROGRAM

Informant was personally contacted on 3/25/64 by
SAs NEWTON FE. YOST and J. G. WHITTINGTON,

Informant immediately and positively identified
from a group of photographs one rea eae of TANGREDI TORTORA,
aka., Albert Bruno, etc., FB 369, as being identical
; with the individual he had Br in as ALBERTO DANGREDO..

Informant advised that his acquaintance with
TANGREDI TORTORA was limited and that he had not seen him
in approximately 35 or more years. As a Neapolitan, he would
pronounce a "fT" as a "D" (DANGREDI rather than TANGREDTI).
Informant noted that TANGREDI TORTORA, during the period he
knew him, used varlous names (apparently while in fugitive
status), The name most commonly used, howéver, in informant's
experience, and the one he presumed to be his true name, was
ALBERTO DANGREBO. Informant did recall, however, among the
names he had known TANGREDI TORTORA to use at least on
occasion, were the following:

ALBERTO BRUNO. JOE CALCAGNIO
LUIGI MARINO ; EGLEMENTO ETTABELLO

ALBERTO TORTORA

sn Snterview on 3/25/64, informant could add little |
to the facts of this matter hot already furnished by him. He did
recall the following: ;

JOHNCROSSELLI has never mentioned his first name to
informant. Informant state firs earned t m I
mother. ROSSELLI always thought a great deal of his mother's
welfare and always sent money; periodically, to her. As weil. j
as informant can recall, in about 1928, informant first went
pack to Boston with money for the mother. At that time, informant
eontatted the mother directiy and shé would ask him, “How is
i my FELIPE?" er). it was thus, through ROSSELLI's family, not
through ROSSELLI, that he learned his first name.

Informant continued to bring money from ROSSELLI
to his mother until about the late 1930s. It was somewhere
around this time that the procedure was changed and THOMAS
LUCHESE handled the matter as previously described. However,
the informant apparently, remained the emergency communication
link between ROSSELLI and his family. :

About three or so years ago, ALBERTO SACCO contacted
informant te advise him of the death of ANTONIO SANTANIELLO .
and the need to set up another procedure for the trensfer of —
this money, Informant, in turn, contacted ROSSELLI. ROSSELLI
pagein asked informant to handle the matter and the present
procedure was sét up.

Informant recalled, on 3/25/64, that ROSSELLI's

mother was about. 82 years old and that her first name was
MARTA. He described her as short and stocky, born in Italy.

‘Informant stated the name BUSCEMA was unknown to
him, but could be explained by a second marriage. DAPASQUALE

mother resides in the Boston area with ROSSELLI's sister,
CONNIE. CONNIE is married to a barber. Informant does not
recall CONNI£’s husband's last name, but recalled his first
