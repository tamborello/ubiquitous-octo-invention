Re: Inmate Harold J. Vincent, PMB #73128
Louisiana State Penitentiary

Dear Sir:

Pursuant to our conversation on December 14, 1978,
in Washington, D. C., I am forwarding with this letter two
(2) tapes reflecting an interview with the captioned subject,
by two (2) of my Investigators, Glen Bullard and Al Millican.

I am also enclosing a memorandum from Investigator
Bullard, to Chief Investigator Ruggiero, explaining how this
interview developed, and all pertinent rap sheets in our
possession.

If we can be of any further assistance to the
Bureau or the House Assassinations Committee please contact

As VINCENT led Investigators to believe he would .speak . freely
regarding the assassination and contract murder, Investigators
returned to Baton Rowge and advised Chief Investigator RUGGIERO
of the situation. It was subsequently decided Investigators
BULLARD and MILLICAN would return the following day, December
12, 1978 and completely debreif VINCENT regarding any information
he might possess. . The interview was.to be tape recorded.

‘ December 12, 1978, VINCENT was debriefed, and VINCENT was.
cooperative. VINCENT did request he be transferred to a
"protection status" and was advised if. the information he

provided was found to be truthful, the necessary arrangements

would be made. | : wo, . ; :
