like a G-D.elevator. The other man told him he must
realize-all the federal agents there are who know who the
top fellow is and they will keep pressuring him until he
goes broke, BALISTRIERI said they are on his back and
each time somebody. comes in to bée him, the Federal Agents
question the person, regarding BALISTRIERI's financial
interests and don't give him a chance to make any money.
He said the reason he is doing all right now is that

the new chief is giving him a chance to make a buck and
is giving him some nice breaks! "I know what he wants,

I don't want no trouble, right?"

MZ 623=6-TE was out of town at the time of this meeting

and had no information concerning it. It is noted, however,
that the contents of the meeting corroborate quite an
-amount of the information given by this informant.

It is requested that the translation be expedited so that
the entire tape may again be reviewed.
