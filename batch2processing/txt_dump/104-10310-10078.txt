MEMORANDUM FOR: Special Assistant to the
, Deputy Director for Operations

ATTENTION t. Mr. Richard Fuller

- SUBJECT _°:. Department of Justice. Request, dated
; : ‘ 13 Jan 1976, Pertaining to "Domestic
Collection--270 Calls" (OGC 76-0178)

REFERENCE : Request of OGC, dated 26 Jan 1976,
: Requesting Division D Assistance to
Respond to Subject Request -

1. This memorandum responds to reference request
and its contents aré for the information and use of
Mr. George W. Clarke, Assistant General Counsel.

2. Attached, in accordance with reference request,
is an unsanitized copy of Division D memorandum FID 113/72
for transmittal to the Department of Justice.

_3. Subject Department of Justice request asked, in
sub-paragraph 2}, that this Agency provide a copy of a —
memorandum dated 25 February 1972:to the General Counsel
requesting a legal opinion "re telephone tickets". A
thorough search of our files fails to indicate that such
a memorandum was ever written. We speculate that the
request to the OGC was verbal. We note, to support this
thesis, that the memorandum (sub-paragraph 3) of subject)
of James Boylan, OGC, is dated 25 February 1972 and suggest

. .. that this memorandum is actually the subject of both
' sub-paragraphs 2) and 3) of the subject request.
