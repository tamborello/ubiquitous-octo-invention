i. { _|coverage. From the time the Mexico St ation was opened in

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to Rae

these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

if they telked about’ shop,” they would talk to each other.)

‘of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD |
people checking the best type of camere » film, and concealment
devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC, ©

the street from the front gate of the Soviet Embassy which had
both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the
