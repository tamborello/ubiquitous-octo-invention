3. Processing of LIENVOY Information. The only change in the LIENVOY

processing during this period was the aadition of another line (25-07-77), Eleaa
VAZQUEZ Gomez, to those lines from which LIENVOY transcribers provide

full Spanigh transcripts. This was to support a Headquarters PBRUMEN/AMROD
request and places a heavy burden on the three transcribera who are also doing
full transcripts of the eleven other lines xoted in reference. During June/July
1944, there were 1222 tapes recorded from whicn 3435 pages of text were
transcribed, In addition, 230 pages of text were transcribed in the daily
“resumen® which consisted of mly the significant conversations from lines

means of access to Soviet personnel,

MEXI-915, 9340 and O412 reported U.S, citizea Ray SPEDDING waa
trying lo arrange through the Soviet Embassy in Mexico for permission to Jo to
the USSR,. (Subsequently, in late August 19od, the Mexican press reported that
SPEDDING had committed suicide in Hotel Edison, )

LIENVOY was of considerable value in monitoring the reaction to
AMSTRUT +2 defection and also was of value in monitoring the activities of

AMSTET-L.

In addition to these reported individually, several other U.S, citizens
contacted both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies, When identified, these namoe
were reported to Headquarters and in some cases to the Office of the Legal Attache.

MEXI-0204 revealed a contact by Ana Luisa DURAND, Puerto Rican,
and the Cuban Embasuy regarding a teaching position in Cuba.

MEX1-0327 and 0424 reported that the Czechs intended to open an
Embassy in Costa Rica,

+ 5. Liaison, CURTIS had several meetings during this period with LIENVOY -<
and LIELEGANT, Subjects discussed were reported by cables,

& Security. There were no security problems or incidents during thig
period,

7. Technical, There were no technical problems during this period,
é, Personnel, In July, representatives’of the Inspector General's Office
viaited the Mexico City Station, reviewed LIENVOY project files, and met
outside the Station with Arnold F, AREHART, They appeared to be pleased
with the project and recommended that Sialf Agent AREHART be given a promotion,

Thomae W, LUND, Mexco Branch Chief, visited the Mexico Cit;
Station 16-19 July and was given a general briefing on LIENVOY.

MEXI-02ué reported the desire of the wife of Orville IORSFALL to
obtain employment at‘fhe Belgian Embassy, As a result of this and for better
security in transporting the LIENVOY reels each day, HORSFALL was ‘eliminated
from LIENVOY as a courier. He still has tourist cover and it was felt unnecessary
to take the risk of an automobile accident or exposure of his early morning
meetings by accident or design should the Belgians conduct an investigation or
neighborhood check, Such exposure could be most embarraasing uuring the pre~
election period d LITEMPO-2, RIGGS and AREHART again resumed the daily
deliveries of reels to the transcribers or their case officer, The risk of an
accident is always present but both RIGGS and AREHART have some cover which

should prevent examination of their briefcases,

The wife of Douglas J, FEINGLASS was employed to assist with
LIENVOY translation and traascription duties, freeing FEINGLASS to concentrate
on assessment and characterization reports on Soviet Embasey personnel as well
ag building up a library of voice recordings,
