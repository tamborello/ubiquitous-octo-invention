On 11/1/71, BS 769-PC advised SA DENNIS M. CONDON
that ALBERT HORRIGAN, Attorney and close associate of
GENNARO J. ANGIULO, has been contacting SANTO DIAFERIO at
Walpole State Prison, Walpole, Mass. Atty. HORRIGAN
believes that he can use DIAFERIO as a defense witness to
help RAYMOND PATRIARCA beat his murder case in Providence,
R. I. HORRIGAN wants DIAFERIO to testify that he was with
JOHN KELLEY at some other location at the time KELLEY says
he was speaking with RAYMOND PATRIARCA. DIAFERIO, in order
not to have to testify, told HORRIGAN that he, DIAFERIO,
was out of state at a motel at the time they wanted him
to allege he was with KELLEY. He told HORRIGAN that the
law would find the notel records and show that he was
committing perjury. HORRIGAN told DIAFERIO not to be
concerned as hotel records would not be in existence, going
pack three or four years. Informant said that DIAFERIO
will not testify for PATRIARCA and nas already told them
that he does not want to go up against JACK KELLEY as KELLEY
has “too mucn on him."
