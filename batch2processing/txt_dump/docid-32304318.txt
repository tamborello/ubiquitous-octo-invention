According to Inspector THURSTON, OSTACH and WILSON:
departed from the Toronto Airport at 2:36 PM on August 18, 1964
both destined for New York City with OSTACH scheduled to
stay in New York while WILSON had further reservations to
Washington, D. ©.

Inspector THURSTON stated that he had been told by
the stock promoter who was behind this scheme in Toronto '
that he had been informed presumably by MORTON FARBER that i
WILSON was one of the most accomplished sound technicians
in-the United States having handled the installation of
sound equipment in the past for the Central Intelligence |
Agency. H

Inspector THURSTON advised that the work done by
WILSON in this particular job in Toronto was of the highest
caliber with all wiring, microphones, etc., extremely well
concealed, and that the setup found by the Toronto Police
Department was sufficient to handle approximately eight such
installations,

REED SUTTON WILSON
FRED OSTACH
MORTON FARBER

On August 20, 1964, Inspector HERBERT THURSTON, Head
of the Morality Bureau, Metropolitan Toronto Police Department
(MEPD), confidentially advised the Buffalo FBI Office that
his department on the previous day had recovered approximately
$7,00000 worth of technical equipment inéluding microphones,
transmitters, monitoring set, recording equipment and tapes ‘
from an otherwise vacant suite of offices in a downtown :
Toronto office building.

Inspector THURSTON stated that investigation.by !
him disclosed that a Toronto securities promoter, whof:. ‘He :
did not identify, but whom he described as a disreputable
individual, had acknowledged during interview that the . !
technical equipment recovered in Toronto had been brought
there and installed at his behest.

Inspector THURSTON stated that according to this
man's story, he was promoting a particular stock issue. in
Toronto, the underwriting of which was handled by a reputable
stock brokerage firm in Toronto whose name Inspector THURSTON
did not disclose. The stock promoter claimed that his purpose
in obtaining this equipment and arranging for its installation
was so that he could monitor the activities of the stock
brokerage firm, particularly conversations carried on in
their quarters not otherwise available to the public so that
he would know what action to take with regard to the buying a
and selling of this particular securities issue.

 

Inspector THURSTON added that while he was inclined '
to believe that thisstory was partially true, he believed that
the stock promoter and his associates probably would have
used any information obtained through this source for :
blackmail, extortion or whatever other purposes it might have
served.

Inspector THURSTON stated that their investigation
indicated that when the stock promoter decided to embark upon

1964, < He was accompanied. by an individual who used the name
R. WILSON and who was called REED while in Toronto. In |
checking into the Ki Edward Hotel, the latter individual,
gave his address as 1428 North Fuller Avenue, Los Angeles’,

“After looking over the situation, these individuals
agreed to make the necessary installation for a fee of . :
$25,000 plus the cost of the technical equipment. The office
obtained by these individuals for the setting up of their
recording equipment was located in the same building but six

REED SUTTON WILSON
CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

Re Bureau airtel to all SACs dated ee |

Forwarded herewith for the Bureau are five copies i
of a Letterhead Memorandum captioned "REED SUTTON WILSON,
FRED OSTACH, MORTON FARBER" reflecting information furnished
to SA JAMES P. MC MAHON of this office on a confidential
pasis by Inspector HERBERT THURSTON, Morality Bureau, |
Metropolitan Toronto Police Department (MTPD). :

 

It is noted that in furnishing this information, |
Inspector THURSTON did not identify the stock brokerage i
firm involved nor did he furnish the name of the stock i
promoter who employed WILSON in Toronto. Inspector THURSTON
explained that the nature of this operation was so delicate
that if the identities of the stock brokerage firm and the
stock promoter became a matter of public knowledge, the effect
upon the Toronto Stock Exchange could be disastrous and for
that reason the Toronto Police Department was not even recording
those names in their own files.

s '

 

 

Inspector THURSTON also stated that no criminal
or other charges were anticipated in this case since the victim |
of the technical installations did not sign a complaint for ‘
this same reaso a ®that cited abeve. Inspector THURSTON
