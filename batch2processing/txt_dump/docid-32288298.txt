the LKA had been unable to verify the subject's arrival
in Munich and had determined that specifically he had not
checked into the Bayerischer Hof Hotel. It was learned that
this hotel had made a revised reservation for the subject for
January 20-22, 1961, but that these hotel reservations had been
canceled by telephone by Swiss Air when the subject had not
arrived in Munich frem Zurich, Switzerland, as expected
on Swiss Air on January 20, 1961. On January 25, 1961, the

sports. The car had been hired by ALEX from the Selbstfahrer-
Union at Munich No. 27 Birkerstrasse,

1961, unexpectedly and without giving prior notice. to the hotel
and removed all of his luggage. After leaving the hotel and
while driving to the highway he picked up on Sendlingerstrasse
the blond woman, who was described as about 23 to 25 years old
and well dressed. At the car rental firm Selbstfahrer Union
it was learned that ALEX had been recommended to this firm
by one STEVE LOHR of General Tours, 595 Madison Avenue,
New York 23, New York, who is a business friend of the
Manager of the Munich firm, one Mr. HILZBERGER. When ALEX
had approached the Munich firm he had done so by referring to
LOHR. He came to the firm first on January 20, 1961, about
noon and asked for a car to be available at a later date.
When he picked up the car on January 25, he also asked for
maps of Austria and stated that he would travel to Innsbruck
and Kitzbuehel, Austria, and would return the car on Sunday,
January 29, 1961, at the latest.

was determined that on the night of January 26-27, 1961, he
stayed at the Hotel Bayerischer Hof, where he used Room .
Number 30. He checked out of this hotel at about 10:40 a.m.
on January 27, 1961, leaving by taxi and carrying all his
luggage, which consisted of two suitcases and a pair of. skis.
It could not be established where ALEX went with this taxi.

did not have any visitors at that hotel, nor was he observed
in any conversation other than with hotel personnel.

leaving Munich on January 25, 1961, until he checked in at the
Bayerischer Hof Hotel on January 26. He arrived back with
his rented car, which he arranged to have picked up by the
rental firm at the hotel on January 27, 1961, at 9:00 0 "clock.

Chicago, Illinois

CG T-1 advised in the early part of 1961 that
information had come to his attention indicating that GUS
ALEX was interested in obtaining accounts for the Standard
Refuse Removal Service at 1220 South Leavitt. He stated that
it is not clear to him that ALEX actually has a financial
interest in this company but stated that it is possible that
ALEX has been attempting to line up customers for the company
due to the fact that its owners are associates of his and that
he is interested not in financial profit but in doing favors
for these individuals. ’

information was subsequently received that while ALEX was
at the Hotel Richmond in Geneva on January 18 and 20, 1961,
he was in contact with one EDMOND COHEN, a French national,
who is aresident of Istanbul, Turkey. The Geneva Police
Department advised that thesignificance of the contact with
COHEN was unknown, since COHEN had not come to their
attention previously. They advised that the meeting between

of the Hotel Richmond and that it appears that there is

no significance to the contact, COHEN not having come to
their attention previously. The Geneva Police Department
also indicated that ALEX had been in touch with one PAUL

Innsbruck and Kitzbuehl, Austria.

He was seen at the hotel with a woman who was apparently.
German and that she left the hotel on January 21, 1961, with
