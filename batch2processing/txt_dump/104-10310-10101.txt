SECRET 29 [1G
TO: Walt Elder: fi .

: SSC Letter of 12 January 1976 (x ~0083)

1. In an attempt to clarify the apparent confusion

‘cited in para 2 of reference, we reviewed the file and

based on an analysis of the Record amd Routing Sheets, we

have been able to ascertain that prior to the assassination

the only FBI documents in the 201 file were the reports of

SA Jahn Fain dated August 30, 1962 and July 3, 1961. The

two documents. referred to by Mr. Wall, namely~the October 31,
1963 Report of SA Milton Kaack and the May 12, 1960 Report

of SA John Fain while in possession of the CIA were not in

the official 201 prior to Novenber 22, 1963. The former was
being routed to various components of CI Staff and not filed
until either the day of the assassination or a few days later;
while the latter was filed in enather file unrelated to Oswald's
201. We hope the above serves to resolve any questions related
to what was in the official 201 file om the day of the assas-
sination.

2. Attached are 4 copies of the documents listed in
para 4 of reference, with the following comments:

a. Para 4 B, items 62 and 70 are identical, hence
only one copy is being forwarded;

b. Para 4 B, item 64 gives a DIR 67737 which is not
part of the Oswald 201. We note in the 201, however, a message
to DIR with an IN number of 67737 which appears to be the docu-
ment in question and is herewith included;

c. Para 4 B, item 74,'is a State Department docu-
ment and requires prior clearazce from State for release.

d. Para 4 C, item 2, requests Mexi 6543, believe
Mexi 6534, is the correct document and is being provided
vice Mexi 6543.

---e,. Para -4 E, item 28,-asked for Mexi 7025 dated
November 29, 19635 which is not im the file, we believe the
document regyested,jis,Mexi 7122 dated November 1963-and is
herewith at d RG give FF .

f. Para 4 BE, item 29, requests Mexi 7026 which is
not in the 201, apparently the correct document is Mexi 7126
which is attached.

g. Para 4 L, item 2. We could not locate the docu-
ment in the. Warren Commission Files. Mr. Dwyer said he would
come to the building to check, admitting he may have provided
wrong date and file number.

3. “Attached. ‘are 4 copies of two additional documents,
previously requested, which Mr. Dwyer asked on 22 -January
1976, to be included with this package. ;

4s Attached is an iden list. Pseudonyms are indicated.
Unfortunately. on two occasions, we assigned: two idens to the
same name, therefore, note that Iden 35 and 54 are interchange-
able as are Iden 26 and 29. Although we have attempted to
correct the mistake on the documents, there may be a few

which were overlooked. — Sorry.
