Re: Samuel M, Giancana

to be a mail drop and meeting place for Giancana indicated this may
} be a house of prostitution. Inquiry and observations reveals

the presence of numerous females of questionable background on these

premises. \\\\

D. E, Stephens, the Village President of Rosemont, Illinois,
advised he was contacted several months ago by Rocco Potenzo and
| offered $1,000 per month to permit gambling operations at the
Airliner Lounge in Rosemont;. Stephens refused the offer and ordered
the gambling operations closed. Potenzo is the chief lieutenant of
Giancana for northwest suburbs and is reported to operate the
Airliner Lounge for Giancana,.\\\

Giancana's brother, Charles Kane, also operates the Thunder-
bolt Motel for Giancana at Rosemont, Village President Stephens
advises he has seen .Giancana in the motel on numerous occasions,

He expressed an intense dislike for him and said he would furnish
to the FBI identities of persons visiting the Thunderholt Motel ; \
together with license numbers of their automobiles. |\\ !

 

Fy

The Chicago Office and all other offices ae leads
in this matter have been instructed to follow this investigation
vigorously in efforts to develop a violation on Giancana as soon
