NOTE, CONTINUED:

' Department. - Investigation developed no indication Von Schwanitz
was disloyal. He has had considerable marital troubles and,
because of a former wife's apparent involvement in some petty
thefts in recent years, Bureau has not directed any commendatory

letters to Von Schwanitz, although we have thanked one of
1 his editors in the past. All pertinent information concerning
Von Schwanitz has been provided Tampa.

Ninfa Santos has been described as undependable
alcoholic who has indicated pro-Castro sympathies.

made application last May through Czech Embassy for permission
