report, advised SA JOHN L. PUDDISTER as follows:

He has been treating members of the MANNARINO organization

for about seven years and would gladly furnish information
concerning them and their activities. Dr. MC CLOWRY, who

is of the Roman Catholic faith, has also been called upon

many times to treat Priests and Nuns, with particular
reference to Mt. St. Peter's. Roman Catholic Church, Freeport
Road, New Kensington, Pa., thé parish to which the MANNARINOs
belong. Father FUSCO is Pastor of the parish, and his
chauffeur is JOHN STANISH, who is also a registered nurse.
Both have been Dr. MC CLOWRY's patients at one time or another.
During the period in late 1958 that a subpoena was outstanding
for SAM MANNARINO's appearance before a Federal Grand Jury,
Pittsburgh, he was being hidden, part of the time, by Father
FUSCO on the third floor of the Apostulate House for Mt. St.
Peter's Roman Catholic Church, located at 204 Charles Street,
New Kensington. Dr. MC CLOWRY has asked Father FUSCO on many
occasions not to assist the MANNARINOs, but Father FUSCO, a
“pure blooded Sicilian," has stated: that the MANNARINOs are
his "boys" and that the Federal Government is persecuting

them for things which are quite legal in Italy. Father FUSCO
attended the coronation of Pope John XXIII, along with his
chauffeur, JOHN STANISH. STANISH has told Dr. MC CLOWRY that
upon returning from Italy, Father FUSCO was met in New York
City by ALBERT ANASTASIA's limousine and that they were

rushed through customs without an examination of luggage.
STANISH said they stayed a few days in ANASTASIA's home and
then returned to New Kensington. Approximately two weeks
later, ANASTASIA was shot to death in New York City. MC CLOWRY
has said he will furnish medical records on a confidential
basis’ and will attempt to obtain a photograph of SAM MANNARINO.

In view of the fact that certain information developed gives
some indication that SAMUEL MANNARINO could be involved in
the cases captioned "STUART SUTOR, et al; TGP; ITSP; NM; FFA
(partite a7 hake} and "BERNARD J. EZHAYA, et al; ITSP - MT
Bufile 87-41245)" and may become a subject of one or both,
considerable investigative time has been devoted to them.

In addition, the first named case may be presented for trial
in September, 1959, in U. S. District Court, Pittsburgh.
This means that Top Hoodlum SAMUEL MANNARINO may be found

to be implicated in two substantive matters within the

jurisdiction of the FBI. .. Because there is still considerable
investigation to conduct in both above-named cases and
pecause investigation in those ‘cases in effect constitutes
investigation of the MANNARINO organization, it is felt that
the interest of the Bureau will best be served by concentra-
tion on those cases. UACB and nitial
