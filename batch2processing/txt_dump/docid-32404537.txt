Peggy,

as I mentioned, the judge and jeremy came to visit our
office director yesterday .... very pleasant ... and everybody
said the right thing about “working together.”

things continue to move forward quickly.

attached is the ARRB’s “review guidelines” received last
night and our what will be our hand-written slight suggested
modifications ... and ... most important ... our interpretive
memo. our lawyers have reviewed &nd find them legally identical.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS AGREEMENT PRESERVES THE SECRECT RE
OFFICIAL COVER AND THERE WILL BE NO OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF
ANY SPECIFIC COVER AS A RESULT OF A RELEASE OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH
DOCUMENTS BY THE ARRB.

let me know soonest your thoughts (out Friday COB is
target)... especially if you want anything included in our memo
(the review guidelines belong to them so the thought was suggest
as few changes as possible AND put any clarifying language we ,
want in our interpretive memo) .

lastly, as for the second “legal” memo for Calder/Kennedy
signature, we can also incorporate any changes but my sense is
the staff and Board are fairly comfortable with it so it does not
appear to be of overarching necessity to make changes. -
thanks,

~ Lee Strickland

Assassination Records Review Board
Review Guidelines .
for Information Relating to Official Cover _

This document sets forth the review guidelines for use by the Assassination Records Review Board
(“Board” or “ARRB”) and the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA” or “Agency”) for public release of
certain information conceming the identity, scope, details, and specific mechanisms of official cover
(hereafter “official cover details”). These guidelines have been officially adopted by the Board to serve the
public interest in making the complete story of the JFK assassination available while protecting from
official disclosure information which would be harmful to the national security and is properly classified
under Executive Order 12958.

1, Information in documents originated by the Congress (most often in the context of personal
statements to committees or committee staffs) which sets forth official cover details shall be presumptively
released unless it sets forth specific information not generally known to the public or the Agency shall be
able to demonstrate that it has taken affirmative action to prevent thé disclosure of such information in the
past and that release here would cause identifiable damage to the national security.

2. Information in documents originated by the Executive Branch (including those designated by the
parties as quasi-executive branch documents which reflect extracts from the records of the Executive
Branch) which sets forth official cover details shall be presumptively postponed to the extent that it
concems:

. identification of the official cover. provider,
° specific locations used for official cover, and
. identity, scope, details and mechanisms of any particular official cover.

3. Information in such documents which the Executive Branch has ‘taken an affirmative act to-
officially disclose or allow to be disclosed shall be presumed to be releasable.

4. Moreover, information in such documents which relates to individuals who are considered
important to the story of the assassination shall, consistent with past practice, be considered for release on
an individual basis with the Agency having a higher standard of proof of damage to the national security.

5. For any information postponed pursuant to these Guidelines, the Agency agrees to provide a
summary or substitution which preserves the content and relevance of the postponed information.

. Neither these guidelines nor the release of documents pursuant to these guidelines shall be deemed
to constitute an official Executive Branch acknowledgment of the identity, scope, details, and specific

’. mechanisms of official cover in other information disclosure law matters.

IN THIS DOCUMER

Dear Director Tenet:

In accordance with the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act _

of 1992, I am writing to inform you that the Assassination Records Review Board has
made additional formal determinations concerning the public disclosure of CIA
records at its meeting on December 15, 1997.

Enclosed is a list of the determinations that the Review Board has made. These
decisions were premised on several factors, including the historical interest in the

documents and the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause
harm to the United States or to any individual.

You have seven days to appeal these decisions to the President. You are invited to send

your representative to the Review Board to examine our copies of the documents for
ations have been made and to discuss the determinations with my staff.

Dear John:
A few months ago we made.a request to the Department of Defense for, inter alia,

“Any available MOUs or MOAs defining command responsibilities and
lines of authority, responsibility and accountability when individuals of
the Central Intelligence Agency serve under ‘military cover,’ ie., are
employed and operate for the CIA while wearing the uniform of the
armed services. (Applicable period of interest here is 1956-64.)”

This letter is our official notification to you that we have made the above-stated request.
We understand that the Agency was advised of this request by the Department of
Defense at the time the request was made. We do, however, apologize for our
inadvertent error in not having provided you with a contemporaneous notification.

Sincerely,
Satta a °

MEMORANDUM FOR: David P. Holmes
Deputy General Counsel .

FROM: Robert J. Eatinger. Jr.
“Assistant General Counsel
Litigation Division, OGC-

SUBJECT: DCI Sources and Methods Authority With Respect
: to JFK Assassination Records

1. Per your request, I have attached a copy of the
President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992 (ARCA), Pub. L. 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443-2458, reprinted at
a4 U.S.C. § 2107 note. For your convenience, I have highiighrced
the pertinent provisions that will aid in resconding to an
inquiry regarding the statute's effect on the DCI's statutory
authority to protect intelligence sources and metheds.

2. The clear language and intent of the law is to supersede
statutes that prohibit disclesure of information, except for some
irrelevant subject areas, such as tax records. The statute
provides that "3t shall take precedence over any other law
(except section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code), judicial
decision construing such law, or common law doctrine that would
otherwise prohibit" the disclosure of information subject to the
Act. ARCA § 11(a). This language, taken with the provisions
discussed below which limit the intelligence sources and methods
that may be protected and set a strict procedural scheme. by which
information is to be reviewed under the ARCA, effectively
supersedes the DCI's National Security Act authority with respect
to intelligence sources and methods information subject to the
ARCA.

3. Section 6 of the ARCA provides the grounds for which the
release of information may be "postponed." The statute
contemplates that all information will eventually be released.
Indeed, it specifies that all information will be made available
to the public no later than 25 years after the passage of the
ARCA (which occurred in October 1992) unless the president
certifies that continued postponement is necessary. ARCA
§ 4(g) (2) (D). With respect to intelligence-related information,
ARCA allows postponement if: .

"(1) the threat to ... intelligence operations ... is
of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and

such public disclosure would reveal--
