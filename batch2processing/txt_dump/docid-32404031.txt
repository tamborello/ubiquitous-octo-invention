AN
N

1. The Agency strongly objects to the release of names of
individuals presently under cover, whether active’ employees or
separated employees. As described below, this action would
breach Agency commitments to these individuals who agreéd to work
under cover in addition to breaching our obligations to the cover
providers. &

2. Employees sign a secrecy agreement (Attachment A) upon
entering on duty with the Agency. This’ agreement pledges the
employee's secrecy to information which is classified and has not
been publicly acknowledged by the Agency and requires the
employee to protect such information from unauthorized
disclosure. This secrecy agreement, as long as it ,remains in
force by. mutual agreement, obliges CIA to protect the identities
of Agency employees, our cover providers and covert activities.

3. Because this secrecy agreement creates a moral as well
as legal bond between the Agency and the employee, it is Agency
policy to protect the names of former employees ‘who have
Separated under cover unless the Agency and the employee mutually
agree to remove the cover. Identifying as CIA’/those employees

who are mandated by the Agency to use a cover story, l.e.,
Po or ror thee entire

gency career as well as into their years after separation from
the Agency, jeopardizes:

¢ the personal safety of former employees;

° the protection of sources and methods (what. :
individual would agree to a clandestine relationship
with American intelligence knowing: the secret

4. Examples of: how identifying covert employees as CIA will
affect individuals follows: “ A ig

sr. [ retired under

cover and is currently working

  
     
       

Revealing his name would damage his relationship
with his current employer, his position with the
firm and would be awkward at best regarding the host
countries. Attachment B is

acknowledgement that he was aware he would be denied
as a CIA employee and Attachment C is his signed
secrecy agreement. : : .

« Attachment D is a signed ackowledgement from Mr.
John Whitten who retired under cover in 1970 which
shows that he was/aware that he would be denied as
an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency from
the date he entered on duty through the date of his
departure. Attachment E is a personal letter
received from Mr. Whitten after he was notified that
his name might be released in connection with
declassification of CIA documents: Attachment F is

Mr. Whitten’'s signed secrecy agreement. It should
be noted that Mr. Whitten resides inf

jeopardized if it became publicly known that they were providing
cover to CIA employees.’ The } could very well
raise objections to our future use of cover. Of increasing

importance to the Agency at this time is the critical use of
private sector (nonofficial) cover providers. The private sector
would no doubt drop contact and avoid future dealings with us if
we reveal a covert relationship. Identifying covert
relationships with cover providers would paralyze Agency
operations which in turn could severely damage national security.
In addition, in the past it. has exposed CIA to legal liabilities
and substantial monetary damages. }

6. Headquarters Regulation (HR) 240+1 is the Agency's
regulation on cover. It states that “cover is required for all.
Agency operations, activities and installations abroad, including
personnel in PCS or TDY status.” HR 240-2, the Agency's
regulation on cover after separation, states that “the
determination that an employee will retain all or a Part of his
or her cover after separation from the Agency will be based upon -
the judgment that Separation in an overt status could result in
damage to the national security by compromising intelligence
Sources, methods, activities, and/or information, or cause harm
to foreign relations. This determination will be made on a case-

7. Release of names of former employees who separated under
cover will make the entire Agency cover program vulnerable and
detract from our continuing efforts to enhance cover and conduct
sometimes dangerous activities necessary to carry out the
Agency’s mission. We can accept the purpose of the JFK
Assassination Records Review Act to declassify documents for
public consumption; however, we submit that the release of true
names of former Agency employees adds no value to the documents
in addition to risking physical harm to these individuals from
our public detractors. We propose and emphatically encourage
that pseudonyms, aliases or generic job descriptions such as desk
officer be used in place of true names which would not diminish
the impact of the documents.
