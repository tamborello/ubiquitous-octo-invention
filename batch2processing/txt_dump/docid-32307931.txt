ITs RULES OF CONDUCT —

' Qn July 8, 1966, NK 7-23 advised that a man becomes
a leader in “the organization" because he is successful ‘and
has a number of people whom he directs and who look to him
as their authority and protection, Informant said when the
above is true and the individual has a territory or sphere
of influence, he is known as a "don", The persons under the
"don" must come to him to settle their problems or get his ~
permission before going to another "don" :to settle a matter...

Informant explained’ that RAY DE CARLO is his "don";
and even though he, informant, has known RICHIE BOIARDO for
40 years, he could not go to *Don" BOIARDO in a dispute, nor
could he go to any other "don", Informant said that. if one’
of RAY's men were to persist in an effort to break the rule,
then it would be necessary for RAY to have him killed, not-
withstanding that he be his closest friend or even his brother.

: Informant said he has seen instances in the past
where a man would be in the "barn" complaining to RAY about
something and RAY would not even listen to him, but would
curse him out in a loud voice and tell him'to get out, RAY
would probably say something to the effect, "Why haven't you
gone to TONY BANANNAS or. the 'Bsot*?", as the case may be.

Informant said there are not many killings today
when compared with those of years ago, He said, "There are
many unmarked graves in Bergen County." Informant said
that in the days (1-4 years ago) when he spent a lot of
tdmeeat the "barn" (DE CAREO’s headquarters) there were a
number of young "puke who came there when they could
seek to curry favor with DE CARLO. It was apparent to
informant that the younger element was seeking to please
DE CARLO.. Sometimes RAY would give such a person a summer
job or something in particular RAY wanted done, in order to see
how. well this individual would do it. In almost all cases, the
individual would make aneffort to do even more than RAY might
request, particularly ‘4f-it were a question of putting on a
little pressure or making a collection,

Qn other occasions, RAY might forget a man and

wait as much as a year or more _and then, seemingly out of
the blue sky, would say to informant or another associate,

NK 92-1203

“What happened to that guy from (name of town) who came with
(name of person)"; and RAY would say, "Go out and get that

guy and bring him here tonight." Informant would then have © .
to find this man and have him in RAY's headquarters. that night.
At this point, RAY would. probably give him a ‘job or some’ —
responsibility over a period of. time and observe. how well his
duties were carried out. If RAY was satisfied, he would likely
tell one of his associates, "Put him on the payroll for $300

a week", and it would be done, ,

 

. On February 23, 1967, NK T-3 advised that DUTCH MELE, ;
a tavern owner in the Middlesex County area, had borrowed :
$2,000 Shyy: money from. ANTONIO ‘CAPONIGRO and had ‘become ~ (
delinquent’ in his payments.  CAPONIGRO had demanded a $5,500 lump :
sum payment or $350 a week from MELE. MELE. was unable to
meet either payment and the word was out that CAPONIGRO had
ordered a-hit for MELE; It was then that SAMUEL DE CAVALCANTE
had a sit-down at ‘his office in Kenilworth, New Jersey, as a ~
result of which the hit order was removed and MELE was instructed
to pay CAPONIGRO $100 a week for some indefinite period.

present at the sit-down were DE CAVALCANTE,
CAPONIGRO, MELE and PETE MANTELLA, @ CAPONIGRO man.

: On April 5, 1967, NK T-4 advised that recently one

of ANTONIO CAPONIGRO's men, one TONY, a nephew of CAPONIGRO

from Passaic, New Jersey, had gotten out of line. This —

nephew of CAPONIGRO went to the site of the monte. game operated

by CLAUDE HAMMOND and FRANK MALLAMACI in West New York,

New Jersey, and roughed up a couple of young guys who owed !
the nephew of CAPONIGRO some shylock money. Informant '
said that MALLAMACI protested this action to ANGELO BRUNO, fj
Caporegime of ANTONIO CAPONIGRO. — CAPONIGRO reprimanded his Y.,
nephew, who claimed to be drunk. when he ordered this action /
and CAPONIGRO later went to MALLAMACI to apologize for /
the trouble. /

. /

 

On May 9, 1967, NK T-35 stated that WHITEY DANZO j—
had attempted to move in on FAT LOUIE LARASSO’s territory, /
4n or near Elizabeth, New Jersey, in the. same manner. /

As a result,. LARASSO: personally gave DANZO a physical beating ,
for his attempt and deterred DANZO from encroaching on his /
action, The informant stated that DANZO did not complain. to

‘ anyone and as a matter of fact, attempted to conceal it from

. even his closest associates, . /

On November 1, 1966, NK -T=-8 advised that he had
been told by one "GUS", a Greek from Bridgeport, Connecticut,
who. claimed to be very close to PAUL AGRESTA, also known as
“Paul The Greaser," of Bridgeport, that AGRESTA and ZICARELLI
are in the same "family" and that although AGRESTA was higher
in rank than ZICARELLI, ZICARELLI was well respected,

On November 30, 1966, NK T-8 advised that JOE
ZICARELLI stated that JOE ADONIS' son (JOSEPH MICHAEL DOTO)
is being groomed for an important position in the LCN,

On January 4, 1967, NK T-3 advised that even though
DE CAVALCANTE has his own New Jersey LCN family, he still answers
to the "big boys" in Brooklyn,

On January 11, 1967, NK T-4 advised that he was
recently in the company of several members of the LCN family
of JOSEPH BONANNO and from their conversation, it was apparent
that they are unhappy with JOE BONANNO as a boss, Source got
the impression that BONANNO was due for a "hit" although this
was not openly discussed,

SALVATORE PROFACI, JR., Son of the late New York City
LCN family boss JOSEPH PROFACI, is married to the daughter of
JOSEPH "WHITEY" DANZO, who is closely associated with SAMUEL’ -
DE CAVALCANTE. .

NK T-3 on January 19, 1967, advised that DANZO claims
that SALVATORE PROFACI, JR. is being groomed for the purpose of
some day having a big responsibility in the affairs of LCN.

On March 9, 1967, NK T-9 advised that he recently
visited FRANK MAJURI in MAJURI's home. He said that MAJURI
told him that he is "worried to death" because there is trouble
brewing in SAMUEL DE CAVALCANTE's family. Source said that SAM
is hogging everything and is not cutting up the action just like
"BIG PHIL" AMARI did years ago, Informant said that there is
discontentment among the people working for SAM and that trouble
has to come,

DE CAVALCANTE does not trust MAJURI because MAJURI: has
a tendency to take money that does not belong to him and run,
He said that MAJURI has done this in the past but because of his
closeness to DE CAVALCANTE, has gotten away with it, Informant
said that DE CAVALCANTE goes regularly to MAJURI's home for
dinner and that everytime he, informant, is there, DE CAVALCANTE
shows up.

while he, informant, waited hearby at Charlie's Tavern, which
is located on Prince Street near La Fayette Street, New York
City. This tavern is owned. by DANZO's brother and is used as
a meeting place for the hoodlums,

On the same date, informant advised that DANZO,
after conferring with FRANK SALERNO, discussed the following:

He said that the "real leaders" in "the Organization"
are the "old Mustangs" who are almost never seen and most of
whom do not even speak English, He said that the ones who are
arrested and make the papers are powerful themselves, but that
the "Mustangs" give them their orders,

DANZO said that the PROFACI family of LCN (now known
as the JOSEPH COLOMBO family) is by far the most powerful of LCN.
This family controls the underworld activities in Chicago,
Illinois, Las Vegas, Nevada, New Orleans, Louisiana, all of
California and Puerto Rico, and the alleged LCN family bosses
of those areas, such as CARLOS MARCELLO and SANTO TRAFICANTE, .
actually answer to COLOMBO and pay "dues" to that family.
According to DANZO, New Jersey family boss SAMUEL DE CAVALCANTE
is also "under" COLOMBO,

DANZO's daughter recently married SALVATORE PROFACI °
JR. According to DANZO, this is the first time that any
"connected" guy was ever allowed to marry outside the "family."
He said that PROFACI,; JR. is being groomed to become a.big boss
in “the Organization." :

On October 20, 1966, NK T-4 advised that THOMAS EBOLI
is not running the VITO GENOVESE family of LCN while GENOVESE
is in jail. The real power in the family is 74 year old MIKE
MIRANDA, . . “

_ On October 27, 1966, NK T-4 advised that the position
of boss of the present DE CAVALCANTE family was first offered
to ANTONIO ROCCO CAPONIGRO upon the death of DELMORE,

CAPONIGRO, whom source described as a Caporegime in
ANGELO BRUNO's Philadelphia LCN family, turned the position down.

- According ‘t6 this source, everything in South Jersey,
including DE CAVALCANTE's family, is under ANGELO BRUNO. |

This source also advised on January 11,°1967, that

"all the guys working under Caponigro" fight one another for the
top jobs because CAPONIGRO "treats" these men so good.

in that position, A vote on this point is supposed to be

taken soon, ZICARELLI hopes that the vote will go against

him as’ he.-wants out of this position. According to this source,
ZICARELLI is not cut out for a position of big leadership and he
cannot stand the. pressure, . : .

. Again on December 7, 1966, source advised that vote
for ZICARELLI's promotion is scheduled for the near future and
the New York fedple are putting a lot of pressure to bring the
matter to a head, .

This source also advised on February 1, 1967, that
he had recently talked with RALPH DE MEGLIO, strong-arm man
for LCN figure JOSEPH ZICARELLI. From this conversation, he
learned that ZICARELLI and DE:MEGLIO drove to a Spot in New York
City where they were met by eight individuals, four in each of
two automobiles, ZICARELLI was put in the back seat of: one car
between. two’ men and DE MEGLIO in the. back seat of the other car,
Each of the cars took off in. separate directions, but some time
later arrived at the same. place, DE MEGLIO confided that he
thought that both he and ZICARELLI were going to be "hit,"

ZICARELLI and DE MEGLIO had been taken to the residence
of LCN boss JOSEPH BONANNO. BONANNO had called in ZICARELLI and.
DE MEGLIO just. went along for the ride, From. what DE MEGLIO
said, BONANNO is trying desperately to regain his former position
as boss of the LCN family of JOSEPH BONANNO, This position is
currently held by. GASPARE DE GREGORIO. Informant said that from
what ZICARELLI apparently told DE MEGLIO.after the meeting,
BONANNO wants ZICARELLI in. the same position (underboss) that he
holds for DE GREGORIO if BONANNO is able to regain his control,

ZICARELLI, according to DE MEGLIO, is “scared to
death" because he feels that he is in the middle of this power
struggle between BONANNO and DE GREGORIO and that he, ZICARELLI,
could very easily wind up dead. BONANNO is seeking ZICARELLI's
support in his bid to regain control of his old LCN family.

- On February 28, 1967, NK T-4 advised that during the
week of February 20, 1967, JOSEPH ZICARELLI met with "BILLY"
BONANNO, son of JOSEPH BONANNO, LCN boss, at the Walk Inn .
Restaurant, Cliffside Park, New Jersey, which is owned by ERNEST
“TUBBY” DAVINO. BONANNO was accompanied by two of his strong-arm
men, VITO and TONY. ZICARELLI was accompanied by his strong-arm
man, RALPH DE MEGLIO, At the-conclusion of this meeting,
ZICARELLI was "shaky,"
