in Munich where they probably visited with one ANNA BERGEN,
born 4/20/98 at Sackenhagen, (no country given), who is un-
married and who is registered as being an owner of a business.
At 12:45PM FUEGER and her mother checked out of their hotel

and using the mother's Volkswagen automobile left Munich

toward the south along the Landsbergstrasse. The Bavarian
State Police determined that they travelled to House #4 in

It was learned that on 11/23/64, FUEGER called the
. following telephone numbers;

 

Zurich, Switzerland #241700

Diessen, Germany #7116

The BKA is attempting to check the Diessen number.
The two women made future reservations at the

Koenigshof Hotel for a double room for the nights of 12/17 and 18,
1964.
