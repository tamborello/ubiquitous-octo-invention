SUBJECT «5 Politieal Organtear for Cuba

1. Following cur conversation of a few days ago I asked -
Horses N. Davia to look into the matter of sending s political
orgenizer tg Cuba to do a first-hand study on the sosne. Hr. Davie
talent sieat ef your staff and they agreod thet such
an orgenisér could probably aske a valuable contribution to the
Station's efforts vir-eevie building up an effestive opposition
to the Castro govermemt. .

2, Sines we do not desire to blow our intentions to the
consultant price ta receiving ¢ go~ehead from your Mvision, ve
eaanct estimate the exact cost of the consultant’s TOY, however,
thirty days on the scene should not cost sare than $2,000, plus
expenses end he might coms cheaper, This ulll be a subject for
diecussion betveen Mr. Davis and the consultant at the tine the
proposal is made to him. We believe he wll make himself avalleble
to go, however, we cannot guarentee it et this tise, Should tho
individual we have in mind bo umable to go wa will, af course, make
every affort to find a substitute.

3. 2 am, gt @ Graft Joczatch preparod hy Mr. Davie and
