to his secretary and receptionist, and she recalls that two
men in suits, one with gray hair, walked into the hall lead-

been there before. She also told Mr. HARGREAVES that earlier
in the week a man delivered a case of olives and had asked
the location of the LANZA office. She also stated that
the elderly man, who has been around for sometime, also
went to the LANZA office one day this week.
