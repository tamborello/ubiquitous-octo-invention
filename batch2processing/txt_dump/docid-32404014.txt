CENTER for the STUDY of INTELLIGENCE

10 October 1995

Mr. David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Assassination Records
Review Board

600 E Street, NW

Washington, DC 20530.

Dear David:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 3 October 1995
to Director of Central Intelligence Deutch advising of the
Assassination Records Review Board's most recent formal
determinations with respect to CIA records.

We have reviewed again the 61 documents which the Board
has decided to release now, either fully or with some
portions postponed. Please advise the Board that the Agency
does not plan to appeal to the President for additional
postponements with respect to these documents.

We note that for five of the documents, further review
will be necessary by the year 2005 to determine if
additional information can be released then. In the
meantime, we are prepared to discuss with the Board and your
staff any issues that may arise regarding the assassination
records. ,

Sincerely,

Jr Leese

John F. Pereira
