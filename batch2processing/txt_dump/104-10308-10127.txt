'October, .It now appears that AMFAUNA-26 never redei either of these
‘sets of groups.” As of 22 November when AMFAUNA~-26's sister -Olga arrived
in Mextco (see paragraph 5), AMFAUNA-26 already had in her possessfon ¢ -
the letter containing the groups written in SW, but either had tridd and
failed to develop it, or had hesitated to try to do so, not knowing in
‘what strength to use the reagent and erroneously thinking that this was
a critical factor. As mentioned previously, AMFAUNA-26 did not receive
SW message no, 10 until 22 December; on the. following day she sent an
open telegram to the son of AMFAUNA-32 in Miami, confirming her willing-
ness to travel to Pinar del Rio and recover the material, It is not
known whether she actually did so,

4, It had been planned, | once AMFAUNA~26 wa; ving OWVL and
her ability to recover caches confirmed, to have¢AMWEE-l\cache AMFAUNA~1 Ic
radio. and to inform AMFAUNA-26 of its location by OWL. Events did not
permit: this.

5, AMFLORA-1 sent. a -telegran to his ‘JMWAVE area accommodation
address on 16 November 1963, reporting that his wife,: the sister of .
i AMFAUNA-26, was due to arrive in Mexico City on 20 November, Mexico
‘City Station was so informed on 18 November (see WAVE-7762), but by the
time confirmation arrived (MEXI-7031 ‘of 23 November) the lady had
already departed for Caracas. The oral messages which she brought from
AMFAUNA~26 therefore did not reach JMWAVE until 20 December when HVCA-
10780 was recéived. - This dispatch transmitted a typewritten note from
AMFLORA-1's wife containing the following information:

a. AMFAUNA-26 had run out of developer pills, (In retrospect
this does not seem to be true, because AMFAUNA~26 was evidently able to
..develop SW message no, 10 which she received on 22 December (see paragrapt

3).- What AMFAUNA-26 had probably been trying to convey was that she
was running very short of pills, AMFAUNA-1-does not remember how many
he gave her, but the most probable number appears to be twelve.)

b. AMFAUNA-26 had been unable to develop the SW message
containing her cipher groups, because she had not been told how to mix
her reagent.

c.’ AMCUTLER-2 was very worried by the fact that AMFAUNA-14
had been telephoning her frequently, and was afraid that + AMFAUNA-14 was
betraying her to the DSE.

ad. AMFAUNA-26 was uneasy about being left in Cuba without a
responsible leader to report to.

e. AMFAUNA-26's cover was wearing very thin, due to indis-
- eretions »by- AMFAUNA-31,

6. In her SW message no, 29, which was received at JMWAVE on 21
October, AMFAUNA-26 reported that AMFAUNA-38 had been arrested on 7
September and taken to Santa Clara. At 0200 hours on the following
morning, fourteen policemen came to AMFAUNA-26's house and searched it
: on the pretext of looking for a burglar. However, the only part of the
j house which they searched was the part. inhabited Bcf AMFAUNA-26.
ye
fe 7. %In her SW message no. 30, AMFAUNA-26 ppoxted “the full names.
éf ‘two individuals who had approached her sub: gents AMFAUNA-29 and
: FAUNA-31, claiming t @ doing underground erk against CASTRO. These
; persons are one Amable #FSANCHEZ Borroto and #ne Raul €SIMON Delgado.
: While neither JMWAVE nor Headquarters (DIR-78835 of 30 October 1963)
had any traces on these persons, JMWAVE has a carded reference to a
sensitive source document which carries the full name of Amable SANCHEZ
Borroto and the implication that he enjoys the confidence of the Cuban
Government. Unfortunately, an error was mad typing the card, and
the document is unrecoverable, In SW messag 0: AMF AUNA~26 was
; _told to. be careful: with the person. ‘

Action Required: For Your Information

Reference: UFGA-11700, dated 14 October 1963

Operational Developments:

. 1. Seven SW messages were received from AMFAUNA-26 during the
period, and two were sent to her, Two SW messages written by AMFAUNA-2!
‘no, 34 and no. 36, have -not been received and it is. not known what has
happened to them. It. has been observed that mail to and from Cienfuego:
is very slow and uricertain; SW message no. 10 sent to AMFAUNA-26 on 6
November did not reach her until 22 December.

2. A continuing effort. was made during the period to activate

~ AMPAUNA~26's OWVL and medium speed radio systems. OWVL transmissions

, were begun on 16 October with message no. 1 warning AMFAUNA~26 of the
arrest of AMFAUNA-14 the week before {see AMFAUNA-1 Progress Report for
October, November and December 1963) and the fact that AMCUTLER-2 was
under surveillance, AMFAUNA-26. was unable to receive this message. In,
her SW-message no, 35 of 25 October, she reported that her radio set is
calibrated in meters instead of kilocycles and she had been unable to
find the correct:.frequency. JMWAVE then sent AMFAUNA-26 instructions
for" converting kilocycles to meters, and began transmitting dummy
messages, giving AMFAUNA-26 a simple code for reporting by commercial
telegram whether she was receiving them, and whether and with what books
she was able to decipher.

 

        
     
 
     
       
       
       
    

    

3. Two sets of deciphering materials had been sent to AMFAUNA-26.
One package was buried by AMGLEN-9 in Pinar del Rio Province (see WAVE-
5887 of 16 October 1963), and AMFAUNA-26 was informed of its location
in OWVL message no. 1 of 16 October and SW message no. 10 of 6 November.
A previous set of number groups had been sent to her by SW early in

9. In outgoing SW message no. 9 of 30 September, AMFAUNA-26 had
been asked to investigate a Cuban naval officer named Carlos *LOPEZ
Avalos with. a view to forming an opinion as.to his political attitude.
She reported. in SW message no. 37 of 3 November that all reports on
this individual were derogatory except for one given by AMLAME-~5, This
report Peached /AMFAUNA-26 via AMFAUNA-31 who got it from a man identified
only as Ramon PEREZ who said that AMLAME-5 had told him that he had a
contact. to the. Swiss Embassy, and that LOPEZ was already connected with

' 11. The reason for AMFAUNA-26's arrest ‘remains obscure, or rather
there are so many acceptable explanations that the problem is to select
the right one, She could have been implicated by AMFAUSA-38, as would
seem to be suggested by the fact that her house was searched immediately
following AMFAUNA-38's arrest; if so, however, it is hard to explain

-why AMFAUNA-26 herself was not arrested until three and one-half months
latex. She could have been denounced by AMCUTLER-2 who was herself
arrested two or three days before AMFAUNA-26's arrest; this seems unlikel
in view of the fact that AMCUTLER-2 and AMFAUNA-26 are friends, that when
AMCUTLER-2 reaches the point where she is ready to implicate other
members of the AMFAUNA net she could be expected to begin with people
who are not her friends, and that at least one such person (AMFAUNA-25) |
was known to be at liberty as recently as 4 January 1964, as were two of
the cutouts between AMFAUNA-26 and AMCUTLER-2 (AMPAUNA-32 and AMFAUNA-33);
AMCUTLER-2 is’ believed to have been under surveillance by the DSE, at !
least sporadically, between 12 and 24 October (see AMFACNA-1 Progress i
Report for October, November, and December 1963), and AWFAUNA-26 could |

{

 

 

have been observed and identified when she visited AMCUYLER-2 during
this period and. marked for subsequent arrest and interrogation in
connection with AMCUTLER-2's activities. AMFAUNA-26 could have made an
attempt between 22 and 29 December to recover the cached cipher groups
(see paragraph 3), and either been detected in the act or arrested while
trying to contact AMCUTLER-2 on the same trip; in this case, however, :
it would seem that the DSE would not have transported her all the way
back to Santa Clara ‘but would have kept her in Havana for concurrent
interrogation with AMCUTLER-2, The open telegram sent to the son of
AMFAUNA-32 on 23 December was rather indiscreet and could have caused
difficulties for the sender, but some of these difficulties ought in this
case to have brushed off on AMFAUNA-32 herself, and as of 3 January 1964

she-was still at yinerty: ay eco ~ PUIG TOF osteo}

spoken with him, and according to the oral message browght out by
AMFAUNA-26's sister (see paragraph 5-e) AMFAUNA-31 has been habitually
.indiscreet. Ramon PEREZ was thus in a position to denounce both AMLAME-5
and AMFAUNA-26. If so, AMFAUNA-31 also ought to have been implicated,
