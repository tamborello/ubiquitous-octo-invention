Regarding Giancana's apartment in Beirut which is close

Ske proximity to the Officer's @lub, it should be noted that the -
z' officer's club is located on the waterfront in the Beirut Harbor.
ge On one side is the Phoenicia Hotel (an Intercontinental Hotel owned
25 by Pan American Airlines) and on the other side a cemetery. To
= 20 the rear of the officer's club are low class two story buildings

\ aBE which have been occupied by the same families for years

: z=na .

a
In addition, the Israelis have never bombed the officer's
club or any other building in Beirut. The only raid in Beirut was
-in April, 1973, and no buildings were bombed in Beirut. The Israelis
bombed only one building duréng this raid on the outskirts of Beirut
to cause a diversion and in this area are housed refugees living in
temporary huts and shacks. Bombings in Beirut are practically a

weekly affair and very little attention is given to them. If there
i 0 Obvious reason for a bombing, the Lebanese usually blame the
Isréelis or the CIA.(e/) YY
