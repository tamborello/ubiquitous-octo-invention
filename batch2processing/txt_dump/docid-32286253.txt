LA 137-2861

LA 4410-C-TE was. interviewed on 3/11/64 by SAs
GEORGE E, BLAND and JAMES F, BRENT,’ and advised as follows: |)

He left Los Angeles with his wife on 1/7/64, and
drove straight through to Chicago, which departure was
caused by information he received concerning a judgement about
to be rendered against his brother for $3,300.00 which actually
was the responsibility of the informant’)

 

when he arrived at Chicago, he contacted his attorney
MIKE KACHIGIAN in regard to this matter. In conversation .
with his attorney he was told by him as well as another
attorney in the same office, MIKE LEVIN, that a contract was
out for informant and neither attorney expected to see him
alive when he appeared in their office. According to LEVIN,
he heard from an someone ata party that a contract was out
to kill informant. , J

  

 

, During informant's stay in Chicago, from shortly
after 1/7/64, to shortly before his arrival back in Los 7 |
Angeles on 3/5/64, he learned the following: U

' From several sources he considers knowledgeable,
he was told that the victim (CHARLES WILLIAM BRAY) in the . !
Miami prosecution of ALDERISIO has been straightened out and |
that they have got to him and he will not stand up for the
government and testify. Uv |

Also that SAM GIANCANA is no longer the boss in !
Chicago but has stepped aside and "MILWAUKEE PHIL" ALDERISIO
has taken over from GIANCANA as the boss. Informant con- |
siders the sources of the above information to be. knowledgeable. J

In order to handle his brother's case, informant '

found it necessary to be in the Cook County Clerk's Office
as well as the State Attorney's Office and commented that no !
one will check a record or do.anything for you without $2.00 :
being paid to them. In this instance, informant said he was
handing out five and ten dollars and sometimes more to
numerous people in order to get the necessary records. In
this regard, he talked to a Deputy Sheriff named SAMUEL PEVIN
who serves subpoenas and who recently had a heart attack. '

| was one of the people who said that "they" had gotten |
to BRAY in Miami. PEVIN was selling Papermate or Scripto,

in OE

 

NW 45792 Docid:32286253 Page 3
 

 

but believed to be Papermate, ball point pens that retail for
$1.98 for 4o¢ a. piece and he had hundreds of them. ‘PEVIN
explained that there were 350,000 such pens stolen from a ~
trailer and they are being sold all.over Chicago for 30¢ and
4og a piece. PEVIN also advised informant that he had —
stolen Admiral portable television ‘sets for $40.00 a piece

as well as stolen Norelco electric. shavers for a very good

' price.. ‘ :

LA 137-2861,

In regard to MANNY SKAR, informant said that ROCKY
DE STEFANO is behind SKAR and they got $300,000 net from the sale of
Sahara Inn North, Chicago. Also that they went to buy back
the Sahara Inn that.they sold to GENE AUTRY and, according
to informant, this may. possibly explain the bombings of the
Sahara. J. ; ‘

Also; DON. JO MEDLEVINE is.close to SKAR and is also’.
believed by informant to be fronting for DE STEFANO. MEDLEVINE
claims to have lost' $60,000 of his own money in the Chez Paris
that recently closed in-Chicago; however, informant does not
believe MEDLEVINE lost anything since they. probably were
stealing off the top. Informant understands that ‘MEDLEVINE’
is coming back: to Los’ Angeles to get into another: operation. J

Informant was asked if he knew DENNIS STEIN, who
is known to have been recently closely associated with SKAR
in Los Angeles. :. Informant recalled a DANNY.STEIN, who was an |

auctioneer from New York who may be identical since his:
description'is similar. \J es

- In regard to the Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada,
it is informant's understanding that the Chicago. outfit owns -
this h0tel. Informant produced’a card reflecting the name ~_
of FRED FRIEDMAN whom he described as former manager at thé:
Riviera Hotel and: was kicked out broke some time ago, and
came to him about.a year ago looking for a job in the vend-
ing machine business. At that time, FRIEDMAN's Los Angeles
Phone number was WE. 1-9090.. Informant. believes that FRIEDMAN,
who. he: knows deeply resents his treatment by the hotel 7
owners, might talk about the operation of the Riviera Hotel. ,/

Informant also mentioned that he has seen JACK FOX
(PCI) and he is real sick. FOX's son BILLY, informant under-
stands, is tied up with FRED STOAS
