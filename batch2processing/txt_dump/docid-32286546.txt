showed him a quantity of loose diamonds and attempted to sell

locate and interview KERN: and JESSIE CHEHARDY.

2. Mabntain contact with Departmental Attorney

KEITH E, GISLESON, New Orleans regarding possibility of
subpoenaing PROVENZANO and LEGAN before FGJ, New Orleans.

ADMINISTRATIVE:

Investigative period of instant report overlaps
that of referenced report as investigation by auxiliary

offices not available prior to submission of referenced report.

This matter has been discussed with Departmental
Attorney GISLESGY:, on several occasions, the last time being
12/2/69. He advised that he is in favor of subpoenaing
both PROVENZANO and LEGAN before FGJ, but because of his
relative tenure as a Departmental Attorney. He contacted
his superiors in Washington, and they did not express any
enthusiasm for this type of action, stating that they felt
that this was "abuse of process", which the RAMSEY CLARK
Administration adopted as policy, i.e. in bringing potential
defendants before Grand Jury where a substantial case could
not be proven. He stated he was in the process of preparing
a memo to his superiors pointing out that it was highly un-
likely that any prosecution at.all could take place and it
would be better to bring PROVENZANO and LEGAN before the
Grand Jury. In hopes of perjuring or immunizing in an attempt
to develop a prosecutive case against JAMES and other two
Unknown subjects could be identified with the cooperation
of either PROVENZANO or LEGAN.
