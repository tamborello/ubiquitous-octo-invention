of any effort outside of Florida with regard to Cubans to fire
On the Keys or on the Florida area there with a boat that
would be disguised as a Russian boat, which was really a
group of people, some of whom were assets of the Agency?

Mr. O'Connell. No.

Mr, Madigan. You never heard of anything Like that?
Mr. O'Connell. Nothing of that, no.

Mr.O'Connell. No.

Mr. Madigan. You never heard of the name?

Mr. O'Connell. Well, the request came to the Security.

I am giving to you now.

Mr. Madigan. We don't have it presently.

Mr. O'Connell. I am sure it is over there.

Mr. Wides. With regard to the discussion of authorization,
would it have been following on Mr. Madigan's point, that this
was a fairly serious and unusual operation that you were given,
and that you would have asked, is this authorized? or how did
the question of Mr. Dulles authorizing it come up, as best you
recall?

Mr. 0'Conhell. I told you, I knew that Mr. Dulles ~- I was
told that Mr. Dulles had authorized it, I can't say quite when

it happened, but I know I was told.

 

Mr. Wides. You testified this morning -~ I don't want
to put words in your mouth -~ I thought you testified that you
were sure that Mr. Edwards told you at this meeting when he fir
gave you the assignment that you were not sure that Mr. Bissell
also mentioned that when you later met in your office.

Mr. O'Connell. I would stick with that, yes. I think it_

probably was when I -- when Colonel Edwards called me he

 

said, this probably has the blessing of the DCI.

   
 

Mr. Wides. Do you know iffhp¢. vis Ssevedis who

  

was head of the Technical Services Division at the time, was
witnessing about this?

and ( Digger reichlery came over to Colonel Edwards'office.

Mr. Wides. But you don't recall whether you ever knew
char SSue: Mg knew what it was in connection with as distinct
from merely knowing it was a lethal pill, is that right?

Mr. O'Connell. I can't say -- to my personal knowledge,
the discussion never came up when I was there. I don't think

he is a dummy, and I don't think} is any dummy, and

 

I think they had a general idea.

But as far as I know they were never officially told.

Mr, Wides. To your knowledge, before you went overseas
no one else in the office of Security, Mr. Bannerman, Mr.

White or Mr. Hall, none of those men or anyone else knew about
the project, only yourself and Mr. Edwards?

Mr. O'Connell. Well, I would say this, to my knowledge
they were never briefed. However, I think I brought up an
incident this morning where Colonel Edwards was on leave and
Cofone1 King called Mr. Bannerman, who was his
deputy, and assumed that Bannerman knew all about it and started
talking about it, what are we going to do about
this -~ I don't know what the conversation was about. And
Bannerman called in and said, what was this all about?

Mr. Wides. This was in 1962 before you left?

Mr. O'Connell. Yes. It was while I was up in the office.

And I said, I don't have the authority to brief you on it.
