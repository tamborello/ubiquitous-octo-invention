wand: profit potential of this venture. This is :
- evidenced by his pledge of. $100,000 of his personal

savings. to support this credit. The company: is 0 ‘

"His major expense. is for labor, which will ‘not

should: average about $3,000.00 a week. It would
‘appear.,. therefore, that he has adequate working F
capital to begin operations. Payment. by contract is

_ has. been suggested. ‘The company. ‘purchasing the

of. the: purchaser. i ; :

"They are. estimating a profit of 40 cents a. ton;
_ however, assuming these estimates are wrong by a

The Subject has no. problem in ‘obtaining a market,
for the stone since ten year contracts, ‘for —
purchase of as much. Stone as the quarry is —
expected, ‘to. produce have already. been obtained.

It. appears that proper ‘tests have been made to

stand that it neets requirements | for’ Ohio roads.

300; 000 ‘tons of stone per year. Estimated profits .

of $120, 000 on this: production would be just. about
enough to repay our loan, without any allowance :
for payment of the balance of the cost of the
