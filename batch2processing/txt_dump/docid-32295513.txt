AR - CONSPIRACY

ReBucab 10/3/63.

Doctor ARISTIDE MANOPULO, .Céntral Bureau, Criminal
Bureau, Italian National Police, Rome, Italy, was furnished
-the. information set out .in referenced Bureau cable. on 10/4/63.

Doctor MANOPULO understands that :-verbatim tran-
scripts of the U. S. Senate Sub-Committee concerning this
matter will not. be available for some three months. He re-
quested, however, that. this office explore the possibility

of obtaining any public source or releaseable Bureau summar ie
of the testimony of JOSEPH M, VALACHI to date.

The Italian public at. large, and the Italian National
Police in particular, are closely following Italian public news
media reports on VALACHI'S testimony, but these reports. are
doubtless briefer and much less comprehensive than press cover-
age afforded the testimony in the U. 8., and particularly
‘Washington, D, C., papers.

Doctor MANOPULO is well aware of the intense interest
of the Bureau in this matter and he has ‘made known .to.the Rome
Office that the Italian National Police and Italian Parliament
are also intensely. interested. He has stated that he will
promptly make: available, in detail, any pertinent. information
developed. He points out, however, - ‘that.it.is only the U. 8S. -
authorities who have, to date, managed to break the curtain
of silence surrounding key ‘personalities. in this matter in

an effective fashion. ; % oy
