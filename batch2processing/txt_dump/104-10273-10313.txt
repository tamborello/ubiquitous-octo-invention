8. Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,

th: Office of Se curity Niami Field Office, and JMWAVE, Ga
Ba tee kD Uecasloiis Satie ai deasi the vas Ly reerest Ds RULria s WA
acl claimed Agency affiliation when in fact there has bean |
none. The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such
affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteercd his services
to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Gerald Patrick HEMMING
is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SFI353 459),

¢ aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In
the late 1950's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter |
claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thereafter,
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and
Central American activities which he named the International
Anti-Communist Brigade. <A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was
named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING. .

9. For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of
a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot
involving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
memorandum, to wit: ‘a memorandum by the writer dated 10 Juna>
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, .Jr.;
and an extract from a book published in early 1976 written by
Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN. |The book coup d'etat
in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John ‘Kennéuy
Ys a diatribe a; against the A Agency and attempts to ee ink Fhe Agency
with the assassination of President KENNEDY, One of the major
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,
Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Intercouti-
nental Penetration Force, Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetriution
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
and that members of this unit were connected with CIA. GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did. so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.

NOTE: The Station also included
information the Chief _of Statiow had received
from ~ . on § dund.” said that he

had peen providing information on ZIMERI to the
Guatemalan government for the past six months or
so. He claimed that two Americans were involved
with ZIMERI, one of them who runs a guard service

 

 

 
 
 

 

in Miami. ’ | did not mention names but
described one of the Americans as about six feet
« four inches and weighing about 230 pounds.

4. The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends
with five requests for information by President LAUGERUD:

a, Is ZIMERI still in the United States? .

b. In the event ZIMERI is not in the United
States legally, deport him to Guatemala.

c. Is ZIMERI recruiting merceraries in the
United States for possible use in
Guatemala?

 

d. Does ZIMERI receive any kind of preferen-.

tial treatment by U. S. authorities which
permit him to carry firearms, as well as
to purchase arms and ammunition for
shipmeat to .Guatemala?.

‘e. Any information on Robert and Gerald

HEMMING? \
5. On 19 June 1976 "| ladvised 1
that DDO is referring the entire matter to the FBI and State

Department.

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent . -
variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HEMMING. 4

7. From the name, physical description, activity, and _ ;
alleged employment, it is apparent that Geraid Patrick HEMMING
is identical with the subject of Office of Security file
429 229, who has been described as six-foot five, 250 pounds,
who is a notorious mercenary and soldier of fortune and who as ;
of May 1975 was ostensibly employed by a private investigation ’
conpany, TEPCOL Security (Office of Security--no record) in
Miami, Florida.
