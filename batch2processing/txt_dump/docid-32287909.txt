The records of the Selective Service Board 39,
2312 West Harrison, Chicago, Illinois, show that SAMUEL M.
C )GIANCANA, registered for Selective Service while an inmate \
of the Federal Penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana, on Oy
12/14/42. He did not submit to a physical examination until
subsequent to his release from Terre Haute. A report of &
GIANCANA's physical examination dated 2/12/44, reveals that
he was rejected for military service because of a consti- U
tutional psychopathic state and inadequate, personality, w®
manifested by strong anti-social trends. (U }

Although informants and other sources of the
Chicago Office furnish varying dates for the succession of {
GIANCANA to the "commission", it is the consensus of opin-
ion that GIANCANA succeeded ANTHONY J. ACCARDO in 1956 {y) X%

During an interview with MARIE PERNO by SA RALPH
R. HILL, now assigned to the Miami Office, it was his ob-
servation that the name of KEELEY SMITH was embedded in the
concrete of a retaining wall or planter located in front
of GIANCANA's residence at 1147 South Wenonah, Oak Park,
Illinois, It is noted that MARIE PERNO resided at 1147
South Wenonah and that the interview took place there. No
further details concerning the nature of this inscription
is available. (v)

Although CG 6443-C advised in 1961 that GIANCANA
and WILLIAM DADANO are "kissing cousins", there is no infor-—
; ; mation available indicating a direct blood relathonship be-
I tween GIANCANA and DAJJANO, and it is believed thatithis was

the method by which the informant meant to indicate the close

i; friendship and association which existed between these two
| leaders of organized crime in Chicago, (uv) ve
