PH 92-44 Sub D

It is noted that PH 623-C* was operating in the
first floor front offices at 775 South 8th Street, utilizing

two altered 44a blocks. On 12/16/64 it was ascertained
that during period this source was inoperative there had
been a change of telephone service at this address. A
telephone utilized by the son of ANGELO BRUNO in the first
floor rear office had been moved to the front office. An
additional telephone had been installed in the front office
using automatic equipment where both phone numbers could be

_ answered on the same instrument. in the process of this
change one 44a block was determined to bé missing. «~~
second A_ block was determined to be in place in.what had
previously been ANGELO BRUNO's pyavate office in the front

portion of the building. This 44A block, however, was in-
operative due.to the fact that the wiring had been rearranged.

There were found to be two pairs of wires on #7
and #8 on this altered 44A block. ‘Time did not permit the
removal of this altered 44A block. ‘This will have to be
done at the earliest possible opportunity.

While in the building a survey was made to determine
if it was feasible to obtain technical coverage in the rear
room of this address, noting that coverage was previously
obtained in this location. It was further noted that the
wires previously used for coverage in the rear office had
been utilized in transferring the telephone service from the
rear office up to the front of the building by the Telephone
Company when making the above-described telephone changes.

Considering that ANGELO BRUNO is making repairs
to this rear office and is apparently contemplating using
this rear office, coverage at this location would be of the
utmost importance. The continuation of coverage in the
front office has lost its importance inasmuch as it is
known now that ANGELO BRUNO's son utilizes the front office
in the operation of his business, the Globe Sanitation Company.

Accordingly, Phila. will continue efforts to remove
the altered 44A block in the front offices of 775 South 8th
Street, Inasmuch as entry to this address is necessary to
retrieve this property, it is requested that Bureau authority
be granted to make this entry at the opportune time commensurate
with full security.
