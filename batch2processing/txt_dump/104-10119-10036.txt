MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT : Herbert Itkin/Mario Brod

1. Pursuant to your instructions, I had NYFO interview
Mr. Philip HORTON, to ascertain whether or not he might be the
Philip HARBIN, who was allegedly ITKIN's contact with the Agency
during 1954. Reference is made to the attached report of interview
of Mr. HORTON wherein he comments that he does not know ITKIN;
did not recruit him; and never acted as a ''cut-out" or handler for
Mr. ITKIN. HORTON states further that since leaving OSS, he has
had no contact with the CIA. (This is not strictly true, since he
did write a letter to Mr. Helms not too long ago.)

2. I will ask the Office of Finance to attempt a trace of the
receipt for $5,000.00 that IFKIN claims he gave HARBIN in
approximately 1957. However, I am inclined to believe that this
recruitment is a figment of ITKIN's imagination.
