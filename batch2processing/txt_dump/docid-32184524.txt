YURI I. NOSENKO

On 1/17/83, source was queried concerning any
knowledge he might have of the NOSENKO matter. He advised
that "officially" the KGB never discusses defectors and
generally all one would hear would be rumor and gossip.
NOSENKO is considered a "trgitor" in the eyes of the KGB
as far as source is aware. G6 he)

The source assumed that NOSENKO told western
intelligence everything concerning Second Chief Directorate
(SCD) activities in Moscow and further assumes that, as is
custom, a "special. Commission" of the SCD was convened
following NOSENKO's defection tg do a damage assessment.

s an aside, source noted that (his defection would be
"examined" by members of the K Directorate of the First
Chief Directorate and by members of the 9th Department of the

s Directorate 16)

Source has no knowledge concerning any connection
between the NOSENKO defection in 1964 and LEE HARVEY OSWALD's
assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963. Aske
to give his opinion on the merits of some speculation that.
NOSENKO defected under the direction of the KGB to convince
the US that the KGB had nothing to do with OSWALD's actions,
source did not believe that to be the case. In source's *
opinion, NOSENKO's defection and all the information he furnished
about the SCD yould have been too great a price to pay "to
save one nan. (4b)

: Source does not believe that (Ehe KGB would risk
"blowing an illegal" by tasking the illegal tp attempt to
locate a defector such as NOSENKO in the west Likewise,
source has never heard that the KGB killed or attempted to kill
a defector. Such actions, if they ever occurred, certainly
ended [after OLEG LYALIN's defection in England in 1971S)

COMMENT;

(‘=
In 1969, [Ene ATLAST ssiegaifeas, in fact, ordered
by the KGB to attempt to verify NOSENKO's ence ata
Washington, D.C. apartment complex. JATLAS s not, hgwever,
given NOSENKO's name but only a physical description. &)
