1. President JOHNSON met with both ABDUL NASUTION, the -
Defense Minister of Indonesia and Pakistan's Foreign, Minister,
ZULFIQAR BHUTTO, separately. NASUTION, in response’to the concern
expressed by the President about Indonesia's attitude toward
Malaysia, replied that Indonesia herself would trict attack, but
would defend herself if attacked, I understand that the -meeting
was profitable, The President expressed his’ concern to BHUTTO -
saying that he hoped to reaffirm friendly rélations between America
and Pakistan and asked that both Presidefts get together soon.

2. At the time of President KENNEDY's death, President AZIKIWE
of Nigeria wrote to President JOHNSON saying that this assassination
indicates that there are deeply rooted feelings against: the American
Negro, and that there is a need for serious consideration by the
African people as to whether,-or not they can trust the U.S. because
of the strong elements which discriminate against the Negro, and
whether or not the UN sheuld be moved to another country. I under-
stand that President JOHNSON without answering the criticism
directly made a written reply on the 29th of November ‘to the effect
that the U.S. would’ keep trying to promete equal human rights.
