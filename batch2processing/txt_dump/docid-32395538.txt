z
CTE WE COUNTERED THE MILITARY THREAT WITH NATO AND THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WITH THE NARS
HALL: PLAN. SUBVERSION WE MET WITH CIA -HELP TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS. ‘AND TT WORKED. L
ATER, .IM LATIN AMERICAN. WE FEARED THE SWEEP OF CASTRO'S COMMUNISM AND CHE GUEVARA. WE
OVERCAME THAT WITH POLITICAL PROGRAMS THROUGH THE ORGANEZATION GF AMERICAN STATES. EC
ONOMILE ASSISTANCE, MILITARY AID TO. GROUPS FIGHTING INSURGENCY. AND THE HELP OF CIA INT
ELLIGENCE. LATIN AMERICA DID NOT FOLLOW CASTRO. SO WE WON THAT, TOO. THE CIA CAN HELP
AMERICA’S FRIENDS WITHOUT INVOLVING AMERICANS. NO AMERICAN SOLDIERS GO ON CLA OPRERATIO
NS. THE AMERICANS MERELY SUPPLY AND ADVISE. AND VERY FEW CF THEM 00 THAT. GENERALLY. - 1
i eRe FOR EXAMPLE. THE CIA WAS ASKED TO HELF BY OUR GOVERNMENT IN 1963. WE DID SO FO .
R ARS. WE NEVER HAD MORE THAN THO OR THREE HUNDRED MEN THERE. THE BATTLE LASTED A
DECADE. DURING THAT TIME. THE NORTH WIETNEMESE INCREASED THEIR FORCES FROM 7.888 TO 7
Wa. 886. YET. THE BATTLE LINES AT ,
MW THE END WERE THE SANE AS IN THE BEGINNING. AND A RELATIVE HANGFUL OF GUR MEN ACCOMPLI
SHED THAT. HELPING THE LAGTIANS FIGHT OFF A FOREIGH COMMUNIST INVASION OF THEIR HOMELA
ND. PEOPLE CALLED THAT A SECRET WAR. BUT FOUR COMMITTEES OF CONGRESS KNEW ABOUT IT. AN
Ne THE LAOTIANS FOUGHT IT. NOT AMERICANS. I°M PROUD OF WHAT KE HAVE DONE. WE MADE OUR M
BISTAKES. WE ALSO HAD OUR. VICTORIES. AMERICA WILL NEED MORE SUCH YICTORIES IN THE FUTUR
E. FOR THE SOVIETS WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH. UNQ@UOTE .

L2 ADRESS TO THE FUND FOR PEACE CONFERENCE ON CIA AND COVERT ACTIONS BY WILLIAM E. CO

3 7

RE HAYE ALSO BEEN, AND ARE STILL, CERTAIN SITUATIONS IN THE WORLD IN WHICH SOME DISCRE
ET SUPPORT CAN ASSIST AMERICA’S FRIENDS AGAINST HER ADVERSARIES! IN THEIR CONTEST FOR
ONTROL OF A FOREIGN NATION’S POLITICAL DIRECTION: WHILE THESE INSTANCES ARE FEW TODAY
COMPARED TO THE 1958°S, I BELIEVE IT ONLY PRUDENT FOR OUR-NATION TO BE ABLE To ACT IN
SUCH SITUATIONS, AND THEREBY FORESTALL GREATER DIFFICULTIES FOR US IN THE FUTURE. IN
OTHER SITUATIONS, ESPECIALLY AFTER NIKITA KHRUSHCHEY’ S -ENTHUSIASTIC ESPOUSAL OF THE TH
ESIS QF "WARS, OF NATIGNAL. LIBERATION," THE UNITED STATES BELIEVED IT ESSENTIAL ‘TO PROY
IDE PARAMILITARY SUPFORT TO CERTAIN GROUPS AND NATIONS. IN- 1962. PRESIDENT KENNEDY, FO
R NATIONAL POLICY REASONS, DID NOT WANT TO USE THE UNIFORMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STAT
A BUT ALSO DID NOT WANT TO BE LIMITED TO A MERE DIPLOMATIC PROTEST AGAINST T

D PRESENCE OF 5.430 NORTH VIETNAMESE TROOPS IN LAOS IN ¥IGLATION OF THE GEN

 
  

  

‘ MEVA ACCORDS. AND THEIR EXPANSION OF CONTROL OVER COMMUNITIES WHO WISHED TO RESIST THEM

A: THUS, CIA WAS. DIRECTED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES, A DUTY WHICH GREW T
SO AOMATOR EFFORT, KNOWN AND APPROVED BY THE LAG GOVERNMENT. BUT NOT CONFRONTING NORTH
VIETNAM AND ITS ALLIES WITH A BIRECT AND O¥VERT U. S.. CHALLENGE. MR. BANFMANN HAS TOLD
A?WOU OF SOME OF THE TERRIBLE HUMAN PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN ANY HAR WHEN IT GROWS To A CONY
ENTLONAL SCALE INVOLVING ARTILLERY. AIR BOMBARDMENT, AND SO FORTH. WHAT HAS PERHAPS NO
T BEEN FULLY PERCEIVED I5 THAT THE AMERICAN ASSISTANCE TO THIS EFFORT INVOLYED A SMALL
COMMITMENT OF CIA AMERICANS AND A SMALL EXPENDITURE OVER’ THE MANY YEARS IN WHICH THIS
ACTION. WAS UNDERTAKEN; AND THAT, AS A RESULT OF THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS OF THE FORCES 5
UPPORTED BY CIA, THE BATTLE LINES AT THE END OF THE PERIOD WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED
FROM THOSE AT THE OPENING. AS WITH THE BAY OF PIGS, WHEN THE ACTIVITY BECAME TOO LARG
E, IT NO LONGER REMAINED SECRET. BUT I THINK THE CIA PEOPLE WHO CONDUCTED THIS EFFORT
DESERVE THE PRAISE OF OUR CITIZENS FOR THE EFFECTIVE BUT MODEST. MANNER IN WHICH PRESID |
ENT KENNEDY*S MISSION WAS CARRIED QUT--A MISSION :

COURSE, FUR CONGRESS TO DECIDE, AND I HAYE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT A FULLY. SATISFACTORY
SOLUTION WILL EVENTUATE. PHOENIX: THIS SUBJECT HAS BEEN BADLY MISUNDERSTOOD IN PUBLIC
DISCUSSIONS. I TESTIFIED FULLY ON THIS SUBJECT IN 1974. BUT SELECTIVE QUOTES FROM THA
T TESTIMONY HAVE BEEN USED TO INDICATE THAT I DIRECTED A PROGRAM OF ASSASSINATION, MUR
DER, ETC., RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF OVER 26,860 VIETNAMESE. I THEN DENIED AND I STIL
L FLATLY DENY SUCH A CHARGE OR SUCH AN INTERPRETATION OF THIS PROGRAM, PHOENIX WAS ON
“EOF A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS UNDER THE GENERAL PACIFICATION EFFORT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ¥
TETNAM. ON DETAIL FROM CIA TO THE DEPARTMENT GF STATE; I WAS THE PRINCIPAL ADYISER- AND
SUPERVISED AMERICAN SUPPORT OF THE PACIFICATION PROGRAM. THE FACIFICATION PROGRAM WAS
FOCUSED ON SECURING THE WILLING PARTICIPATION OF THE POPULATION OF SOUTH VIETNAM AGAT
NST TERROR AND INVASION BY THE NORTH VIETNAMESE AND THE YIET CONG. THE G¥N*S PACIFICAT
ION PROGRAM CONSISTED OF: --ASSISTANGE TO THE LOCAL TERRITORIAL’ FORCES TO INCREASE THE
SECURITY OF THE VILLAGES: --THE DISTRIBUTION GF A HALF MILLION WEAPONS TO THE POFULAT
ION TO USE IN UNPAID SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS (1 KNON OF FEW GOVERNMENTS IN THE WORLD WHICH
WOULD UNDERTAKE SUCH R VENTURE AND HAVE IT MEET WITH SUCH SUCCESS); --THE INDUCEMENT,
RECEPTION AND RESETTLEMENT OF OVER 200,000 DEFECTING MEMBERS OF THE VIET CONG; -~-THE
TEMPORARY SUPPORT AND RETURN TO VILLAGE UF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES; --THE EL
ECTIGN OF LOCAL VILLAGE CHIEFS AND PROVINCIAL COUNCILS: --THE DECENTRALIZATION OF ECON
GMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDS AND PROGRAMS TO LOCALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND COUNCILS INSTEAD
OF SATGON BUREAUCRATS. ONE OF THESE 'PACIFICATION ACTIVITIES WAS THE PHOENIX PROGRAM,
AIMED AT IDENTIFYING, CAPTURING, RALLYING AND, IF NECESSARY, ATTACKING THE LERDERSHIP
