Special Group (Augmented) mee:ings at which General Carter
participated and discussions of Cuba and/or Cuban overflights
during the period August 15 to November 14, 1962. This file
contains a memorandum dated October 16, 1962, from General
Carter to the Special Group Augmented, Subject: "Operation
MONGOOSE Sabotage Proposals." Paragraph lc of this memorandum
contains a proposal that thef{cIA undertake “grenade attack on
the Chinese Communist Embass ivana, to be carried out by
a recruited Cuban agent who his access to a roof overlocking
the embassy garden atid who has volunteered for this mission?

fhe second file in chis collection is entitled
simply "MONGOOSE." This contzins nothing relevant to the
assassination inquiry.

Next in this collection in a large manila

" envelope on which is written in ink the following notation:

"Separate cover attachment to ER75-5938." This envelope
contains miscellaneous papers related to MONGOOSE. The
documents in this envelope contain, among other things, a
long list of potential sabotage targets within Cuba. I found
no reference to assassination, either explicit or implicit.

fhe next file examined is marked "Cuba Special
Subject." This file also contains miscellaneous papers
relating to Project MONGOOSE, none of which contain any
references to assassination.

The last item of this MONGOOSE package consists
of a bulky loose-leaf binder of papers assembled for General
Carter's reference of significant things that happened during
the period of August to Octoter, 1962. In this notebook, the
Inspector General has already flagged entries which refer in
any way to Operation MONGOOSE. I have examined all such
entries. . . ;
