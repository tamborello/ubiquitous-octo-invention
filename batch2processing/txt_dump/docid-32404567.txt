COMMENTS: oO IN THIS Docun in NT ORMATION

Barry,

As we discussed, please note the description of a “privacy” or “back” channel in Dewey

_ Clarridge’s A Spy For All Seasons. Admittedly, Clarridge is discussing the mid-1980's but this
channel was not mentioned during our agency briefings. Didsuch a channel exist in 1959-64?.
How was it used? How did it work? Are any cables sent via this channel recoverable today? As
you know, we are particularly interested in any communications to and from Moscow, Mexico
City, and JMWAVE.

Information ¢ on.“back” channels is the subject of our Request for Additional Information and
Records I No. CIA-13 of November 1, 1 996.2if you wish, an additional formal request focusing on
“back” channels as a broader issue can be sent.

 

Thanks for your help.

Michelle

through a reasonable search using any generic or specific term. Cables
were not captured by any organized filing process and were not placed in
official files. Therefore, there are no indices or other indicators that
could be used to search for them. Because copies that may have been

(U) This memorandum is submitted in response to formal request
number 13 (CIA #13) from the Assassination Records Review Board.

**CIA-13 Mexico City Backchannel Communications

 

a. (C) In the question-and-answer segment of the Directorate of
Operations Records briefing follow-on of 1 April 1997, the
backchannel/privacy topic was covered. First, a distinction needs to be
made between backchannel and privacy channel.

b. (S) In 1959-1964 the term “backchannel” applied to non-Agency
communications through Agency communications facilities; that is, as
utilized by senior officials, including the President, of other U. S.
Government agencies.

Cc. (S) Senior Agency officials conceivably could communicate --
through “privacy channels” -- without coordinating the cable with
Western Hemisphere/Latin America Division, but it would still be in
cable format, addressed “Eyes Only COS,” and would be sent and received
through regular Office of Communications facilities. Agency officers
frequently -- but erroneously -- interchanged the terms “back channel”
and “privacy channel.”

Such cables were not| captured by any organized filing

From: Michelle Combs Pele Coanr bo

Associate Director for Research and Review

Subject: Backchannel Communications Between Mexico City, JMWAVE, and
Headquarters (ARRB Request for Additional Information and Records
No. CIA-13)

 

ARRB Request for Additional Information and Records No. CIA-13 asked CIA to
determine whether there existed any “backchannel” communications between the

Mexico City Station, JMWAVE, or Headquarters during 1963. “Backchannel” was taken
to mean, inter alia, any administrative, senior staff, or restricted access communications
or any written or electronic communications other than cables or dispatches of the types
already included in the JFK Collection. Work by the CIA Team has not uncovered any
indication of an established or|ad hoc informal backchannel per se in 1963. There has
been no indication of the existence of any additional recoverable records other than
official Agency communications.

Members of the CIA Team received a very detailed comprehensive briefing on the
working of the CIA’s Cable Secretariat as it handled electronic cable traffic in 1963.
Various members of the CIA Team also have examined the Mexico City Station,
JMWAVE, and Headquarters communications material available in the JFK Collection
and have seen nothing to indicate that communications existed within another channel.
In addition, the ARRB has spoken informally with numerous former and current CIA
employees who served overseas during the relevant time period. Each of these
individuals, without exception, stated that they had no knowledge of the existence of
any established or ad hoc electronic backchannel communications. Several mentioned
that while such a form of communication might have been possible in 1963, it would
have been a very unusual last resort since both the Chief of Station and the
communicator could have expected to be immediately relieved if such a communication
came to light.

During the relevant time period, CIA electronic cable traffic was handled by CIA
communicators through a restricted handling communications channel separate from

that used by the Department of State for its cable traffic. CLA communicators were
required to send an information copy of every communication between stations to
“Director,” that is, to Headquarters. Once a cable arrives at Headquarters, routing
indicators at the top of the cable and cryptonyms in the “slug line” in the body of the
cable were used to direct a cable to the proper recipients. Cables received widespread
distribution or restricted, special, or proscribed and limited handling based on the
sensitivity and type of information they contained. Any limited distribution to
particular offices was indicated by the routing indicators and any limited distribution
within an office was indicated |by the cable “slug line.” Traffic received by a station
from Headquarters or another|station was handled in the same manner and distributed

to the appropriate individual or branch within the station.

Formal station traffic to and from CIA Headquarters through the diplomatic pouch was
handled by hand in much the same manner as cable traffic. Dispatches were sent to the
designated addressee and packages to the office, branch, or individual indicated on the
address label. However, in 1963, it would not have been unusual for a,Chief of Station
or any other member of a station to send an envelope marked “eyes only” to any
individual in Headquarters, nor would it have been unusual for someone in
Headquarters to send an “eyes only” envelope to an individual in an overseas station.
Since these types of messages were not considered official CIA traffic, no records were
kept. :

 

The CIA reports, and all of the individuals with whom we spoke agreed, that while it
was technically possible for a CIA Chief of Station to send an electronic communication
to his or her counterpart in another station in 1963, to do so would have required the
acquiescence of the communicator to violate one of the most basic and oldest rules of
Agency communications traffic. Yet it was entirely possible to send non-time-sensitive
messages to and from individuals through the diplomatic pouch. In addition, given the
locations of the Mexico City and JMWAVE (Miami) stations, communications could
have been sent via the US Mail system or even by telephone. Communications between
an individual at Headquarters and an individual attached to JMWAVE could easily
have been sent through the mail. Similarly, a person traveling from Mexico City Station
to any location in the United States could be asked to mail a letter or package to an
individual at JMWAVE or Headquarters. Most commonly, sensitive messages simply
were handed to individuals traveling between Headquarters and a particular station
and hand carried to the designated addressee. Hand carried messages and messages
sent by US Mail would have not officially existed as CIA communications. No records
were kept of any non-official traffic between Headquarters and any station.

Dear Mr. Gunn:

Re: ARRB Request CIA 13, for Information
On “Backchannel” Communications

 

The following iis responsive to referent request.

Within referent request and an addendum thereto
accessioned by Mr. Dewey Claridge’s book, you asked for
information on the forms of so-called “backchannel”
communications. Further, the request asks for any
backchannel communications between Mexico City Station, CIA
Headquarters and JMWAVE for specific time periods.

First, we have |previously advised you concerning
Roger/Cactus designated communications which you have
acknowledged as a partial response. Second, during the DO
records briefing follow- on which took place onl
April 1997, a question- -and-answer session, the subject of
“backchannel” communications was covered.

During the period 1959-1964, the term *backchannel’”
applied to non-CIA communications sent through Agency
communications facilities. It was a communications channel
used by senior government officials, including the
President. |

There is another term applied to similar communications
which is frequently!but erroneously labeled *backchannel’”
communications. It is the “privacy” channel used by CIA
managers primarily to discuss personnel matters.

Conceivably senior CIA officials could communicate in the
“privacy” channel without coordinating the cable with a
particular area division, for example Western
Hemisphere/Latin American Division. However, the message
would still be in cable format, addressed “Eyes Only COS” or
something similar, and would be sent and received through
regular Office of Communication facilities.
