Internal Revenue Service Agents are of the opinion ;
that any prosecution of. ROSSELLI for income tax evasion will
probably have to be made on the years 1957: and 1958, as at
the present time, after examining his returns for 1959, 1960,
and 1961, they can see no evidence of a violation. |

Close liaison is béing maintained by the Los Angeles
Office with Internal Revenue Sérvice.

 

On November 7 and 8, 1962, FBI reports in the
ROSSELLI case prior to thé. réport. of SA HAROLD F. DODGE, . :
dated September 12, 1960, at. Los Angeles, were réviewed :
with SAs VERNON EB. LYNCH and HELMER AKOLA, and they indicated,
- as is set out in Los Angeles airtel to the Bureau dated
November 8, 1962; certain pages of these reports containing |
information regarding ROSSELLI's8 bank account afid investment
which they would like Photostats of. In Los Angeles airtel,
it was stated that UACB by Octobér 19, 1962, these Photostats
would -be made available to Internal Revenue Service. \

  
 
  

During the first part of December, SAS LYNCH and
AKOLA plan on‘inaking a trip to New Orleans to interview Mrs.
PHIL KASTEL for information she may be able to furnish |
regarding the formation of the Tropicana Hotel, in which her
deceased husband was active. They then intend to proceed to
Miami, Florida, where they expect to interview JACK BROOKS” ;
and obtain papers and documents he might have concerning his
business association with ROSSELLI, and also to interview an :
individual named LEO MALONY, who held the stock of PHIL KASTEL
in his, MALONY's, name. .
