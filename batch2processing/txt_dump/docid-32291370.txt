, GEORGE E, Q. JOHNSON, JR., was contacted on 12/15/60.
It is noted that JOHNSON is the husband of CAROLE JOHNSON, the
partner of MARIANNE RYAN ALEX, in a dress shop at 110 East
Oak Street in Chicago and is also the partner of MARIANNE RYAN
ALEX in another business concern involving modeling. JOHNSON
has been contacted frequently in the past by SA ROEMER
concerning the marital relationship between GUS and MARIANNE
ALEX and concerning his knowledge of the activities and travel
of ALEX. JOHNSON advised SA ROEMER on 12/15/60 that on

12/14/60 MARIANNE ALEX decided to divorce GUS ALEX. He

stated that MARIANNE has been very unhappy with her relationship
with ALEX for the past year or so and that finally on 12/14/60
she made a firm decision to divorce ALEX, JOHNSON stated,
however, that he has advised her not4 to leave ALEX at the
present time due to the possibility that ALEX could then obtain
the divorce on grounds of desertion and that MARIANNE ALEX

and GUS ALEX will continue to reside at Apartment 1001, Marine
Drive, in Chicago but that they will live in separate rooms

in that apartment.. JOHNSON stated that the reason for MARIANNE’ s
decision is that ‘she has finally become fed up with ALEX's

‘way of life as a hoodlum and that she can no longer stand her

existence as the wife. of a syndicate hoodlum.

JOHNSON advised that he has been acting as MARIANNE
ALEX's attorney in connection with her business affairsbut
that he is not a divorce attorney and does not expect that he
will handle the divorce for MARIANNE; although, he will probably

_ influence her decision as to her choice of an attorney.

JOHNSON stated that he expects that GUS ALEX will choose
EUGENE BERNSTEIN as his attorney in this regard, it being
noted that BERNSTEIN has handled ALEX's tax returns for
many years.

JOHNSON advised that he is agreeable to approaching
MARIANNE ALEX in order to sound her out concerning the
possibility of an interview with SA ROEMER. He stated that he
will talk to MARIANNE and explain to her that it would .
appear to him to be the better course of action to explain
her relationship with ALEX and her knowledge of ALEX's
activities rath@r than to have the FBI investigate by talking
to other friends and associates of MARIANNE. concerning ALEX.

all the bets which he booked. It is noted that CG 6272-C has
advised that it is ALEX's command that all bookmakers operating

in the First Ward must lay off. all: their bets with BRIATTA.

The conversation overheard by the informant showed very definitely
that TORNABENE was to pay off one per cent of what he obtained

in revenue from juke boxes to 100 North LaSalle. 100 North
LaSalle is the headquarters of Alderman JOHN D'ARCO, Alderman

of the First Ward. BRIATTA complained that TORNABENE, in the
Santa Fe Hotel was in the First Ward and that contrary to
instructions, “He would hold the cream and give him the rotten
stuff. There were certain parts that he didn't wanna hold, he
turns it over to us." FERRARO then called TORNABENE two obscene
names and BRIATTA commented as follows: "He double crossed me
(obscene)." FERRARO asked, "How?", and BRIATTA replied, "Because
GUSSIE (ALEX) told him to go over there and if he says one word,
he says wack him right. in the mouth. I went over there and he
didn't yap at all. That's why I went over there and I caught .
him. I said what: the (obscene) you guys doing. Where's the
business. So one afternoon MARCI (PAT MARCI, Secretary to
Alderman JO@HN D'ARCO) and I as they opened the door we got into
the place. There were two fellows making $50.00 and $100.00 bets
and I says, ‘What the (obscene) are ya doin'.' He says oh I just
started this.'t. FERRARO then said, "You want to knock him out of
the box", and BRIATTA replied, "Ya". ' FERRARO then said, "Warn -
him that we're gonna take.action if we catch him holding out
anymore, |

CG 6343-C* then advised that following this conversation
BRIATTA apparently handed to FERRARO $23,650.00. Of this amount
$13,000.00 was returned to BRIATTA and BRIATTA was instructed to
"Take this to John D'Arco". BRIATTA asked, "Take it to the office
or home?" FERRARO replied, "Wherever he's at. $1,600.00. Oh,
here's-the extra." BRIATTA then asked, "Should I give it to v4
John or Pat? If Johnny is not there give it to Pat and say to
Pat give this to Johnny.'' FERRARO replied, "Sure". BRIATTA then ’
said, "Okay, I'll go over there now." : : :

It would also appear from the conversation that \
ALEX and FERRARO have some jurisdiction over TORNBENE and
ARGER, From CG 6232-C it is known that ALEX and FERRARO
have sanctioned TORNBENE's and ARGER's activities in the
loop and without their approval ARGER and TORNBENE could
not continue to operate as they do. ‘This information has\,
been reported in the past. ‘ ee

. CG 6343-C* reported on January 18, 1960, that on
that date SAM GIANCANA and MURRAY HUMPHREYS, Chicago top
hoodlums, had a conversation. HUMPHREYS made the following
comment:

"You know, the older I get, the better I get.
You guys better not put me on the (obscene)
farm."

GIANCANA laughed at that remark.
HUMPHREYS continued:

"What with GUSSIE saying that they're gonna put
him on the.;j(obscene) farm, you better keep me
around."

HUMPHREYS reference to GUSSIE is obviously to GUSSIE
ALEX and it would appear that in view of ALEX's deteriorating
health, ALEX is considering retiring from the Chicago crime
syndicate, at least to some extent.

on the same date, HUMPHREYS had a conversation with
FRANK FERRARO concerning MIKE BROBKIN, weil known Chicago
criminal lawyer with offices at 188 West Randolph. In this
regard, FERRARO made the following comment:

"That meney hungry MIKE. GUSSIE is the guy who
controls him on the price."

Later on this dame date BRODKIN had a conversation
with FERRARO and HUMPHREYS. HUMPHREYS and FERRARO were angry
with BRODKIN in view of the fact that they felt that he was
charging them too much money for a particular situation which

; The reference to STEVE by ALEX midway in the
conversation is probably a reference to STEVE DE KOSTA,

It is noted that DE KOSTA is ostensibly the owner and
manager of the Huckster's Restaurant in Chicago.

According to PCI TURA “SATANA, a burlesque dancer,\ who

is Antimately friendly with HENRY SUSK and also well)
acquainted with GUS ALEX, the Huckster's is operated

by DE KOSTA for SUSK and. ALEX, who are the actual owners.
The reference to CLAIR is apparently a reference to the
owner of three Chicago hotels, the St. Clair, the Croydon,
and the Eastgate, all of which are located on the near
North ‘Side of Chicago. From information furnished by

CG 6343-C* in the past, it is known that CLAIR is very
closely associated with MURRAY HUMPHREYS and other Chicago
hoodlums.-._

On * ‘July 12, 1960, cG 6343-C* furnished the
following information regarding a conversation between
JIMMY CELANO, MURRAY HUMPHREYS, and GUS ALEX, in which
they discussed surveillances and investigations conducted
on themselves by various agencies:

CELANO: "Ty have guys come in, buy a couple suits. |
They: know aboutme. They tap my home
phone. They know my kids go to college.
They know all about me.

HUMPHREYS: They investigate. They did the same
: thing to me. They start out since you
were a kid, All your family. They even
know whether my wife went to urinate.
Divorce too, Gus and her.

ALEX: , ' So what, I haven't done anything.
HUMPHREYS: In 1958 they started. The comings and

goings. Gussie and Frankie. Ross Prio
