On January 30, 1960, DL-6-S, in person, furnished a
handwritten report to SA W. HARLAN BROWN, which report is
dated 1/28/61, and serialized as 134-1A4-570.

 

That report reflected that on Saturday, 1/28/61, MRS.
ELMORE advised JOE LANDIN that the meeting (Forum) had been
postponed because of the weather.

On Sunday night, 1/29/61, ALBERT OROZCO telephoned JOE
LANDIN and informed him that the meeting of the Forum would
take place on Monday, 1/30/61. OROZCO, the Forum's Chairman,
explained to LANDIN that they were about to organize a Junior
Forum and asked LANDIN to bring with him printed matter dealing
with racial discrimination. He specified the article dealing

with the Daughters of the American Revolution. LANDIN said he ~ .

would comply, and asked OROZCO what kind of propaganda was the
Forum giving to its coming scholarship dance, OROZCO said they
had 10 or 12 spots on the radio. LANDIN suggested the Forun .
write a letter and put it up at Stone's barber shop, et cetera.
OROZCO liked the idea and asked JOE LANDIN to draw up an

example. JOE said he would.
