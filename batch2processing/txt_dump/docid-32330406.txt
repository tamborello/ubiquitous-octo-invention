but informant! s absence has precluded this. It is not clear at this

time whether he would have furnished us data on this matter and rapid

sequence of events may.have prevented this. Irrespective of whether he

would have played it straight or not, his arrest was necessary. If he
‘twas not dealing honestly with us he deserves arrest and, if he intended
“Wto deal Cu) us truthfully, his arrest was “necessary for his own personal
safety. ; ;

; We are furnishing brief sunmary of facts in letters to
‘[fpAttorney General and Vice President Nixon.

Details are being, furnished in letter’ to Criminal Division with
copy bg Internal’ Security: Division of Department and in letter to State —
with copiés to’ CIA, intelligence services of armed forces and Inmigration
and Natural ization Service. ;

' In. letters’ to Department of Justice only. we are confidentially
hadvising of informant relationship with Fernandez since it is felt
‘Department must know this rather than be confronted with it unexpectedly
‘at trial.or ptdéor thereto. fo hold out and have to advise Department
later might create impression something was behind concealment. If it
later develops. that ‘there are mitigating factors regarding Fernandez we
will advise Department. Xu)

ACTION s

” Above, action is being. expedited today. Whether or not subjects
are eventually. convicted or simply returned to Cuba their arrest should
serve notice. on. Castro that such activity will not be tolerated.
