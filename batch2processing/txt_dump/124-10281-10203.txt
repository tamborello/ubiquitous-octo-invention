CONFIDENTIAL
HES noted that early\in his involvement with

anti-CASTRO organizations he had been furnishing information
to ROBERT HURWITCH of the U. S. Department of State (USDS),
but has discontinued this practice.

 

HENS advised and it was confirmed by MARSHALL
that when he was approached by ARTHUR and BUCHANAN and made
aware of their plans, he advised MARSHALL of all the details
and told him he did not want to represent the group but
considered them foolhardy enough to cause serious trouble.

He said he would represent the group if the_U. S. Government
would be_interested in their_activities, but wanted assurances
from MARSHALL that all government agencies which should:mow of his
cooperation would’ be so advised. He was told by MARSHALL to -

go ahead with the organization and that MARSHALL would inform

the proper government agencies. The Bureau and Miami are

aware of subsequent developments in this regard.

The same circumstances surrounded i involve-
ment with BENOIT when he advised MARSHALL of BENOIT's request.

also said that he considered his action in

this regard to be a revelation of privileged information
but felt that efforts of the instant

organization were of a serious enough nature to affect the
policy or security of the U. S. and that the information con-
cerning the organization's plans properly belonged in the
jnands of U. S. authorities. He emphasized that at any time
matters of such seriousness come to his attention, the fact
that it is privileged information would not prevent him from
furnishing it to the proper authorities.

Both —ENNMMMJand MARSHALL requested that ay
|ddentity be concealed. MEM made his request because

he felt disclosure of his identity would affect his represent-
ation of and dealings with anti-CASTRO groups and MARSHALL
made his request because MEM is “in the middle of a big
narcotics case,"- and working in the interest of the Bureau

of Narcotics.

BENOIT advised QJ that he had previously been
Sep contact with a CIA representative named "CHARLEY" in the
Bahamas and had received some financial support from CIA
while in the Bahamas. BENOIT later told MMMMthat "CHARLEY"
from CIA had contacted him just after his arrival in Miami.
but he did not disclose the details of this contact.

cao hte Miami is requested to verify whether SAM BENTON is,
in fact, an agent for BENOIT and subject to registration
under the Foreign Agent's Registration Act of 1938, as amended.

WFO does not recommend further contacts with
, however, information voluntarily furnished by
GEENA should be accepted inasmuch as he stated his intention
to advise, through MARSHALL, of any further pertinent develop-
ments.

It is the opinion of WFO that HM will furnish
information regarding pertinent developments. Inasmuch as
feels instant organization is dying a natural death,

his coverage and the coverage afforded by Miami 639-S airs

should adequately inform Bureau of activities of instant
organization and no further active investigation, other than
that set out above, is recommended at this time.

The enclosed LHM is classified "Confidential"
inasmuch as the information contained therein could result
in identification of an informant of another government
investigative agency., :

Concerning assurances that|[MJ wanted that his
cooperation would be made known to all government agencies
which should know of his cooperation, it was pointed out
that no such assurances could be given him and, further,
that concealment of his identity made it impossible to
advise other agencies of his cooperation.

_ [BRRMMJwas' additionally advised that the Bureau
appreciated his cooperation but that his actions in this
regard had to be completely voluntary and that he could
not be directed or guided in any way.
