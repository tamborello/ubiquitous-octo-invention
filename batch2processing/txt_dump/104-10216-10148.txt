work fo> the MHAPRON objectives of the ANMTRUNK Operation.

of the two internal P/A's, AMTRUNK~9, was oxfiltrated with the
four-man AMTRUNK infiltration team for training and operational
. discussions in the JMWAVE area. In early September, ANTRUNK-9
was re~infiltrated into PBRUMEN in Operation AMTRUKE Vv, the
Same Operation which exfiltrated AMFAUNAs ~1, -3, ©13 and =34,
In late October AMICE-27 was separated from the clandestine
part of the AMTRUNK operation. The original objectives of
Operation AHTRUNK VI, postponed from December 1963 to January
21964, were to revitalize and re-direct the efforts of the two
internal P/A's toward their primary task, i.e. to spot and re=
- eruit among high level figures who are dissatisfied with the

Castro regime. In late December, the scope of this mission wag
altered by the receipt of a commercial telegrazs in open code
from AMTRUNK-9 indicating that he was in grave danger and wished
to bs exfiltrated. The twin Objectives of Operation AMTRUNK VI
then became: first, to exfiltrate AMTRUNK-9 and, this accon-
“plished, for AMICE-14 to Proceed to Havana for his task of ree
' channelling ANTRUNK-10's responsibilities. The exfiltration of

AMTRUNK-9, who brought with him his entire family consisting of

wite, brother-in-law, and three szall children, was accomplished
- 00 9 January 1964. The unexpected presence of ANTRUNE-9'g

family, couplet sith reports of increased vigilance in the infile
‘tration area, forced AMICE-14 to exfiltrate the same night with-
, Out attempting to accomplish the second part of his mission.

Successful in that the two principals of the team, AMICE~27

and AMICE-14, were able to contact apd to recruit two princi-
“pal agents and several other action agents to lay the ground=
