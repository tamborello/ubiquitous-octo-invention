OZZIE CURTIS of Los Angeles, who is a cousin of Mrs. SARI
POSNER, originally came to informant and stated that his
cousin, Mrs. POSNER, some time ago, was divorced from her
husband, and at the time of the divorce, was awarded a sum
of money, which had been-agreed upon in a premarital contract.
_ However, subsequent to the marriage, Mr, POSNER, who resides
in Florida, had become worth an. estimated $500,000,000, whereas
when he was married, his estimated wealth was approximately
$40,000,000. ° Source then contacted ROSELLI for a recommenda-
tion for an attorney in Miami who could represent Mrs. POSNER
to get the premarital property agreement nullified and obtain
a much greater sum of money from Mr. POSNER. .

ROSELLI recommended an attorney named FRANK REGANO
of Miami. An agreement. was then*made by the informant,
ROSELLI, and REGANO, that Mrs. POSNER would receive fifty |
percent of any additional money received in a settlement, and
the remaining fifty percent would be split in half and half
would go for REGANO and SANTO TRAFFICANTE, and the other
remaining 25 percent would go to the informant and would be
split three ways between OZZIE CURTIS, JOHN ROSELLI, and the
informant. Informant advised that he would expect the settle-
ment to be not less than. $25,000,000, and the share he would *
receive, to be split with ROSELLI and CURTIS, he estimated is
would be in the neighborhood of $3,006,000;

On 3/27/70, source advised that he received a
telephone call earlier that morning from FRANK REGANO, who
advised that on the previous night, 3/26/70, the Florida
Superior Court made a ruling, which in effect, permitted the
premarital property settlement to be judged individually,
-therefore, there was a chance for him .to now go into court
and seek the SARI POSNER premarital agreement be nullified,
and a settlement made according to the wealth of her husband,
at the time of the divorce. .
