1. Following are the Station’s comments on Reference A as
requested in Reference B. We have broken our comments down by
country. The contacts did not all occur in 1966 but over a period
of several years as noted below, However, we wish to point out that
contacts between the Soviets in Hexico and representatives of Latin
American communist parties is a continuens process year in and year
out. Thus we have knowa for years that Judith FERRETO (Costa Rica),

‘pierre and Suzy CUARLES (Haiti), and Alvaro CANALES (Hondures)
have been in contact with tho Soviets on CP matters. Similarly
there is no doubt but that Brnento-CAPDANO del Vecchio has
. . replaced Victor Manuel GUTIERIEZ as the link between the Soviets
and the CP in Guatemala. Wo just haven't caught. hin in the act
yet. Likewise, the Station believes that Alejandro Dernudez Alegria
