Re Los Angeles letter to Bureau dated 6/5/59
and San Francisco letter to Bureau dated 6/29/59.

i On 7/16/59, SA ROY A, PETERS made a pretext
telephone call to Mel Hedrick Co., 2029 Venice Blid., .
Los Angeles, where PITTMAN was formerly employed. Pretext
was that of a personal friend calling and it was ascer-
tained from the party answering the phone at the Mel
Hedrick Co, that JOHN PITTMAN had not returned to work
there and no further word had been heard from him,

Logical informants in the Los Angeles Office
have been alerted for any information they may receive
concerning JOHN PITTMAN. These informants are LA. 420-8,
‘LAY3063-S, LA 3932-S, LA 3513-Ss, LA’ 3448-S, LA 295 -S,
LA 4130-8, LA 4131-S; and to date none of them have any
information concerning PITTMAN's whereabouts,

As soon as San Francisco verifies PITIMAN's
residence there and that he has gone to Europe, Los

Angeles will submit an FD 128,
