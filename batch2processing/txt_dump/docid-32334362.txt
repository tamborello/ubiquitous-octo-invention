JIM FISHER related that these leaflets were either
printed at Baton Rouge or in the Denham Springs, Louisiana
area and alleged there was to be approximately 30,000 of
these leaflets to be distributed.

    
   
  
   
  

There has been only one group in the Bogalusa,
Louisiana, area known as the Minutemen which has been meeting
in the past. This group is no longer active and no longer
meets due to the lack of interest on the part of the members.
This Minutemen group was organized to conduct acts of
harassmentiagainst LOU MAJORS, the editor of the Bogalusa
newspaper, BASCUM TALLEY, local attorney, and RALPH BLUMBERG,
the owner of radio station WBOX.
