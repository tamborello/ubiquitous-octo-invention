De. WORST OF ALL WAS THE NUMBER OF OFFICIALS WHO DIRECTLY.

CONTACTED THE PRESIDENT, OVER THE HEADS OF RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS, OR THE
PRESIDENTS OWN HABIT OF TAKING UNILATERAL ACTION WITHOUT CONSULTATION
WITH HIS MINISTERS. THIS FREQUENTLY NULLIFIED WEEKS OF CAREFUL
PREPARATORY WORK BY THUAN, TUYEN AND OTHERS.

E. ALTHOUGH THE RUMORS OF CORRUPTION AND FAMILY RULE ARE. GROUND-
LESS, MANY BUREAUCRATS HAVE ACHIEVED FAVOR THROUGH SYCOPHANTIC ATTENTION
TO MONSEIGNOR NGO DINH THUC!S RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES, OR VENERATION
OF THE PRESIDENTS MOTHER, WHILE DIEM HAS NOT ENCOURAGED THIS,

IT HAS APPEALED TO HIS SENTIMENTAL NATURE. HOWEVER, THIS HAS ANGERED
MANY OFFICIALS, INCLUDING SINCERE CATHOLICS, AND HAS BADLY IMPRESSED
THE PEOPLE. MADAME NHU'S HIGH HANDED BEHAVIOR ANO THE MANDARIN~
ROBED FORMALITIES OF NGO FAMILY GATHERINGS AT HUE, HAVE SMACKED OF
IMPERIAL DYNASTY PRACTICES AND HAVE PROVIDED PROPAGANDA THEMES

FOR THE COMMUNISTS AND OPPOSITIONISTS. _

5. OR TUYEN HAS DISCUSSED MANY OF THESE FAULTS WITH NGO DINH
NHU, BROTHER AND ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT. TUYEN BELIEVED THAT NHU
WAS PHILOSOPHICALLY IN AGREEMENT WITH THE GROUP, BUT HESITATED
‘TO TAKE ANY ACTION, NONE OF THE GROUP DARED APPROACH DIEM, EXCEPT
WITH THE PLEA TO DECLARE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY, BUT IF DIEM REFUSED -
TO DELEGATE AUTHORITY OR TO STREAMLINE GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES, SUCH

A DECLARATION WOULD BE WORTHLESS. TUYEN BELIEVED THAT ONLY DIRECT

PRESSURE BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE US WOULD CONVINCE DIEM. TUYEN THOUGHT
A WORKABLE PLAN MIGHT:.BE TO INVITE NHU TO WASHINGTON AS A SPECIAL )
EMISSARY OF THE PRESIDENT. _ THERE THE CARDS WOULD BE LAID ON THE TABLE.
TUYEN ADMITTED DEFICIENCIES IN THE PLAN, ESPECIALLY ITS VULNERABILITY
TO CHARGES OF NEPOTISM, BUT FELT THAT NHU WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO

COULD FULLY REPRESENT DIEM AND RETURN T CONVINCE HIM OF NECESSITY

OF CHANGES. NHU ALSO WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT DIEM WOULD TRUST AS

EX OFFICIO CHAIRMAN OF THE EMERGENCY COMMITTEE, TO GET IT STARTED

“FUNCTIONING, TUYEN ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT NHU AND THE MEMBERS OF
GHUAN'S AND HIS OWN GROUP HAD THE CONTACTS TO AND THE CAPABILITY TO
RALLY GROUPS NOW OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNMENT WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO
HELP AGAINST THE VC BUT WHOSE HELP DIEM SPURNED. HE EXPLAINED THAT |
THERE SHOULD BE NO YIELDING TO PRESSURES FOR LIBERALIZATION.

DEMOCRACY WAS NOT WHAT WAS NEEDED IN VIETNAM!S EXTREMITY, BUT LEADERSHIP.

6. (FIELD COMMENT. CERTAINLY MANY OF THESE CRITICISMS ARE NOT

NEW, BUT TUYEN HAS. NEVER BEFORE ATTACKED FAULTS IN. THE REGIME .SO
FREELY. HE HAS PRIVATELY EXPRESSED HOPE OF: GOVERNMENTAL REFORM,

MORE INTELLIGENT HANDLING OF GVN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PEOPLE
AND ESPECIALLY CULTIVATION AND USE OF TRACTABLE’ OPPOSITIONISTS. HE

HAS ALSO CRITICISED DIEM'S ISOLATION FROM THE’ PEOPLE,’ BUT IN CONSTRUCT-

IVE TERMS. WHILE HE DISCLAIMED THE USE GF ANY FORCE AGAINST DIEM, IT

te A GROUP OF SENIOR GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM (GVN) OFFICIALS
~ CONFERRED ON 17 OCTOBER 1961 CONCERNING THE GRAVE COMMUNIST THREAT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM. THEY aareeo/ THAT NO AMOUNT OF US MILITARY
OR ECONOMIC AID COULD SAVE THE COUNTRY UNLESS “PRESIDENT NGO DINH DIEM
IMMEDIATELY DECLARED A NATIONAL EMERGENCY , APPOINTED A SPECIAL EMERGENCY
COUNCIL TO CUT BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS AND EXECUTE POLICY, AND REFORMED

POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES OF THE GVN FROM THE TOP DOWN.

THE GROUP BELIEVED THAT UNLESS THESE MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO FURNISH
TIMELY, EFFICIENT AND INSPIRED LEADERSHIP, DEFEATISM WOULD SPREAD IN
THE VIETNAMESE NATIONAL ARMY (VNA) AND “AMONG GOVERNMENT WORKERS AND
PEOPLE IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE, AND VIETNAM WILL BE UNABLE To RALLY

AGAINST THE INCREAS ING COMMUNIST PRESSURES » THE GROUP WAS NOT HOPEFUL
THAT DIEM WOULD WILLINGLY. CHANGE FROM HIS DISORGANIZED STYLE OF
"GOVERNING oR TAKE CTION TO “TOTALLY MOBILIZE THE PEOPLE AND WIN THEM

a SSea tee

TO HIS LEADERSHIP. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY FELT THAT ANY tLe “ADVISED

 

  

“ACTION TO FORCE. DIEM OUT WOULD BE. DISASTEROUS, THE OFFICIALS THEREFORE
BELIEVED THE SITUATION HAD REACHED A DESPERATE IMPASSE, UNLESS
PRESIDENT KENNEDY COULD BY A DIRECT FIRM AND FRIENDLY APPROACH, INSIST
THAT DIEM TAKE THE NECESSARY MEASURES.

2. THE OFFICIALS INCLUDED SECRETARY OF STATE AT THE PRESIDENCY,
NGUYEN DINH THUAN: TRAN KIM TUYEN, DIRECTOR OF THE PRESIDENTIAL
SECURITY SERVICE, NGUYEN LUONG, MINISTER OF F LNANCE ; CAO XUAN VY,
DIRECTOR GENERAL OF REPUBLICAN YOUTH; NGO TRONG HIEU, MINISTER OF
CIVIC ACTION, THESE OFFICIALS HOPED THAT CENTRALIZATION OF THE
GOVERNMENT COULD BE BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH A SPECIAL COUNCIL FOR
NATLONAL EMERGENCY AS WAS DONE IN MALAYA, WHICH WOULD HAVE FULL
AUTHORITY 70 EXECUTE THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES AND ENSURE THEIR RAPIO .

BY EXISTING GVN AGENCIES. THEY BELIEVED THAT IF THE PRESENT BUREAUCRATS -

. AND OFFICIALS, EVEN THOSE AT CABINET LEVEL, COULD NOT RESPOND: TO- THE

CHALLENGE, THEY SHOULD BE PROMPTLY REPLACED, SO THAT THEIR SUBORDINATES:
WOULD NOT CONT I NUE TO BE. DEMORALIZED AND VITAL PROGRAMS TO RALLY, THE. .

PROPERLY FUNCTIONING MACHINERY CAPABLE OF ABSORBING CURRENT AND

PROJECTED AMERICAN AID, THAT AID WOULD BE WASTED, AMERICANS WOULD LOSE
FAITH IN VIETNAMESE ANTI-COMMUNIST EFFORTS AND VIETNAM WOULD FALL.
3. THESE OFFICIALS HAVE REALIZED FOR SOME TIME THAT MUCH OF THE
PROBLEM LAY WITH THE PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUND OF DIEM HIMSELF.
THEY THEREFORE HAVE ACCOMMODATED THEMSELVES TO THE SITUATION, TRIED
TO WORK OUT ADMINISTRATIVE SHORTCUTS IN THEIR VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS,
AND DO ALL POSSIBLE TO RALLY POPULAR SUPPORT EVEN FROM NATIONALIST
“OPPOSITION ELEMENTS. THEY NOW BELIEVED, HOWEVER, THAT THE SITUATION
WAS SO SERIOUS AND MORALE DETERIORATING SO FAST THAT THE SITUATION COULD
NOT LONG CONTINUE. .
YW. THEIR CHIEF CRITICISMS OF GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES WERE :
A. LAZY, INCOMPETENT OFFICIALS WERE TOO OFTEN RETAINED FOR MONTHS,
EVEN AFTER THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF ADMITTED THEY SHOULD BE REPLACED,
EITHER BECAUSE DIEM FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS HATED TO FIRE THEM, OR
BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO CLEVERLY FOOL THE PRESIDENT THROUGH FLATTERY
AND FALSE OPTIMISM.
B. VITAL DECISIONS WERE HELD UP WAITING FOR A PRESIDENTIAL
DECISION, WHICH ANY COMPETENT EXECUTIVE GROUP COULD MAKE; .
C. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WERE SET UP WITH CONFLICTING JURISDICTIONS,
OR REORGANIZATIONS, EFFECTED, SUCH AS THE ARMY OPERATIONAL FIELD
COMMAND, THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION AND THE COORDINATING
"SUPER" MINISTRIES WHICH REMAINED FACADES WITH LITTLE OR NO AUTHORITY:
