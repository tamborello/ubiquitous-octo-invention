, Teen foo *

A special system of security and control, known as the PYEMAN
Security and Control System, has been established by the Director of
Central Intelligence for the purpose of providing maximum security
protection to a number of extremely sensitive intelligence collection
projects. Each of these projects requires a separate, special security
approval for access. In your official capacity in connection with U. S.
Government communication systems you have been granted a BYECOM
approval which permits you to perform your official duties as regards
BYEMAN projects in general, without regard to the necessary separate
special security approvals. Strict adherence to the BYEMAWN Control
Manual and all supplemental directives must be adhered to in the handling
of BYEMAN materials or information. You are requested to read and
sign the Secrecy Agreement and Oath.

1. In connection with my indoctrination into the BYEMAN Control
System,I acknowledge my full understanding of an agreement with the
following provisions:

a. Security restrictions and penalties for violations of the
BYEMAN Control System, to which I am subject, are covered
under Title 18, Sections 792, 793, 79h, 795 and 797, U.S. Code
and Section 19 of Public Law 831, Internal Security Act of 1950.

b. It is my responsibility to ascertain that persons with whom
I may have reason to discuss materials or sources of BYEMAN
activities to any degree have also been properly cleared and
designated to receive and discuss BYEMAN information.

c. By reason of my BYEMAN clearance alone I do not have
access to all BYEMAN information or materials but only those
required on a "MUST KNOW!" basis.

d. I will report to the BYEMAN Security Officer immediately
any violations of BYEMAN regulations of which I become aware.

e. I will advise the BYEMAN Security Officer of any
personal changes in my status or assignment.

f. No change in my assignment will relieve me of my obligation
under oath and that the provisions of this oath remain binding at all
times.

2. I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will never divulge, publish,
or reveal either by word, conduct, or by any other means any classified
information, intelligence, or knowledge relative to BYEMAN sources
except in the performance of my official duties and in accordance with the
requirements set forth in the PBYEMAN Control System Manual or
supplemental directives.
