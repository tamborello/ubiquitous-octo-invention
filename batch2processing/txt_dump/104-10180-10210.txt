4, 1 TITY<3 is a Line of liquid fertilizer in which
IDENTETY<6 is also interested, However, since the local fertiliser
industry enjoys protection in the form of impert licensine restrictions,
it will take fron one te two years of netotiation te determine whether
the [7] will permit the importation of this line. ti Gervene would, in
conjunction with IPENTITY-6, represent IDENTITY-1 in the negotiations
to obtain such permission, Again, this rele would provide a degree of
sponsorship by IRENCITY-6 and would enable Pi Gervene to at least mect
significant government officials. While his oreraticnal objectives
do not involve the[_las a target, he could provide assessment and
other operational data useful against this target.

 

 

 

5. IDENTITY-4 produces a line of concrete block manufacturing

machinery and accessories. There little doubt that as capital

equipment, these can be imported into
prospective buyers is Limited. Such a line would not of itself support
Di Gerveno's cover, but would be a satisfactory supplement there to

which would be useful in explaining the fact that he will not devote
his full time to any one activity--and to account for at least that
portion of his income which could not be justified on the basis of

his work on behalf of IDENTITY-2 and -3.

 

 

 

 

6. IDENTITY-5 produces wrought iron for the utility industry.
IMENTITY-1 is considering accepting representation for IDENTITY-5 on
a hemisphere wide basis, - If this line is accented, and vi Gerveno
represents it locally, it will also help to enhance his status and to
account for what would normally be an unusual work pattern.

7. We do net wish at this point to eet into a detailed
discussion of financial arrangements, If, as we hope, fi Gerveno
does make some sales, commissions will be payable to him. If under
existing regulations he could keep at least a proportion of these,
we would favor it as an incentive to work at his cever. If not, we
have confidence that he is a weil enough disciplined professional,
to work at it in any event.

ties we have planned
This would involve
meetings with the agents;

f contact reports, dratts of canted. intei reports and

preparation o
dispatches, plus some tine to think about his operations.

We would expect Ni Gerveno to spend the balance of his work
cover duties. Fis pattern cannot Le neatly:
defined as four hours for cover and four hours daily for operations.

His daily pattern will vary widely and he must retain flexibility in

to reiterate, he will have time for cover work and will be expected to

do it.

Hunkeler, Chester B. Dagnillo and th
1967, The purpose of the conversations
suitable cover to be used under the bro
RPunkeler's various enterprises.

2. The following conclusions were reached:

 

a. That Di Gerveno will come as the
representative for sone of flunkeler'’s sales lines.
Specificaily he will be the representative for IDENTITY-1,
which is Hunkeler's marketing firm.

b. In addition to representing IDENTITY=1, generally,
he will specifically be IDENTITY-1's sales agent for IDENTITY=-25
IDENTITY=3; and IDENTITY-4 and possibly for IDENTITY=-5.

3. IDENTITY-2 is the manufacturer of a wide variety of

industrial epoxy products used in the construction industry and

as a technical advisor to IDENTITY-6, and would not interfere with
IPENTITY-6's marketing activities. tinder these circumstances Di Gerveno
would enjoy a degree of immediate sponsorship by an important local
firm which should assist in the rapid solidification of his status
