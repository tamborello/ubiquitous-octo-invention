The Agency agreed to release slug lines in 1995 {one of the first battles with the ARRB). Since “Aquatic” was used in the slug
line of documents dealing with photo operations in Mexico City it has been released in documents at NARA. We have been advised by the
ARRB staff that unless we can show “current harm" to additional releases they will not accept the protection of (Aquatic’?in slug lines.
If you with to take the issue te the Board at the 6 Aug. meeting, | will need an evidence memo no later than 5 August.

The. specific document in question deals wt, The ARRB staff has agreed te accept our

redactions under the previous agreement on alias documentation. if you want a DS&T look, | recommend you have Tony F. review the
document. If you want to review other files/document related to fAquatie”, I suggest you come to IP to review.
