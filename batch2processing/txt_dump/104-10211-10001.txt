. Por fourteen days between 3 and 21 May 1965, the same CIA
psychologist interviewed NOSENKO on his entire early history,
from birth until about 1953, when he said he entered the KG5.
The main purposes were to collect additional information on this
period,* to gain further psychological insights into NOSEIKO's
personality, and to find possible ways of obtaining a truthful
account. Although conducted under the. physical conditions of
interrogation, the questioning was relaxed and fo}lowed no rigid
outline.: There were relatively few changes of story from pre-
vious versions; at the same time, however, NOSENKO described in
detail some incidents which he has subsequently admitted to be .
untrue. An extract from the psychologist's report of these
interrogations is given below.

interrogations with information given earlier and later by
