MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Center for Studies in Intelligence

FROM: Katherine M. Stricker, DO/IRO
SUBJECT: Discussion re Release of Form 362
REFERENCE: HRG Memorandum, same subject, 6 November 1992

1. When the subject of the Name Trace Form 362
first came up in the JFK material, the DO's position was that the
form is classified, reveals a DO method and must remain
classified, regardless of the name on the form being traced.

2. Now the denied in toto documents are
being reviewed, especially large categories such as the Name
Trace Forms. The DO has reconsidered and, in the interests of
cooperating with the HRG so that some words can appear on
the form, has proposed a modified position allowing for about 1/4
of the form to be released, again depending on the name being
traced. Two HRG officers have indicated that that is
unsatisfactory and they want a "less heavy-handed" approach.

3. The reason the DO is so protective of this
form is that the it represents one of the most unique and
basic of all DO methods, the name trace. That we do name traces
is no secret; how we do them is. The portion of the form the DBO
is prepared to release deals only with the title of the form and
the biographic data required to trace an individual. All other
portions of the form which deal with what other offices are to be
checked and in what order, where the initials and date go, and
how to consolidate 201s are part of a pre-printed classified form
which cannot be released to the public. Methodology is the
primary concern of the DO on this matter, but there is also the
question of fabrication should the entire form be released. We
have been burned in the past by hostile services or corrupt
Americans using our forms for their own purposes-~causing us
untold resources in righting the situation, where caught.

SUBJECT: Discussion re Release of Form 362

4. It occurs to us that if the primary reason
for releasing part of the Form 362 is to eliminate blank pages,
then the goal of the HRG will be accomplished with our proposal.
We urge you to consider the remaining DO equities in this matter.
