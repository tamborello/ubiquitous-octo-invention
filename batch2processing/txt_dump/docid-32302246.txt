2. Miami will attempt to develop additional
sources who can furnish information concerning subject's
activities.

ADMINISTRATIVE

 

: It is to be noted that Captain ALFREDO GUERRA Y
AQUIAR, a relative of PEDRO LUIS DIAZ LANZ, FAR defector, is
the source from whom Colonel ERICKSON NICHOLS, Air Attache, United
States Embassy, Havana, apparently obta is * information
; upon which this case is predicated. GUERRA was formerly in
: the Intelligence Section of the Cuban Air Force. He is
still known to be connected with the Cuban Government.

As the communications received by this office from the Bureau
do not precisely show that GUERRA was the Air Attache's
source. the basis for this investion is being attributed to
the Air Attache. .~- |.

MM 635-S in addition to the information set forth
in the body of instant report, advised that ARTURO FERNANDEZ
- DE CASTRO had -recently furnished United States Customs some
i information concerning some B-25 and B-26 planes in the
_ Miami area and claimed that United States Customs, on the
: bawis of his information had agreed to detain these planes. (eer

) No dissemination of this report is being made to
United States Customs locally and it is recommended that the

Bureau not disseminate this report to United States Customs
on the Washington,level in order to afford a te protection
to MM 635-S. \ z.

It is felt that if United States Customs is in
contact directly with ARTURO FERNANDEZ DE CASTRO concerning -
some matters that information might be inadvertently furnished
to him through interrogatign by United States Customs which |

would expose MM 635-3. (¥ | my ev task
