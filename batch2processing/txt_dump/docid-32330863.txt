MARCELLO and JIMMY CAMPO. NO T-2 believes that PECORA is
a member of the "black hand."

On July 18, 1967, “Mr. MARCEL ABADIE, Supervisory
Loan Officer, Small Business Administration,.. 124 Camp Street,
New Orleans, Louisiana, furnished a copy of a loan authoriza—
tion dated October 14, 1965, This authorization is listed
as a disaster business loan to NOFIO and FRANCES PECORARO,
6027 Chef Menteur Highway, New Orleans, Louisiana. —

The amount of this loan is listed as $210,000°
at 3 percent per annum. The authorization further reflects ;
that commencing twelve moiths from the date of the note, . . ‘
NOFIO PECORARO must pay $910 a month for thirty years.”..This
loan is guaranteed by second mortgage on all land and build-
ings located at 6027 Chef Menteur Highway and is subject
only to a prior mortgage held by the Whitney National Bank.
