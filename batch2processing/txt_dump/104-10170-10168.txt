Texan on 20 Soptexber 19€3, -I was employed ty the Apency in a caprcity which can be

eccurately descrited as that of an erent, in every sense of the word. My assignments

varied and necessitated travel to, three Latin American nations and many atntes, - including

‘ _ the Commonwealth. of Fuerte Rico. They alro necessitated my taking on cover employment

lesotwise ostenribly, other highly-placed government officials. : : .

Mr, Lucey goes on: to state that ay Jast assignment at the tice “was to penetrate the
Fair Play for Cuba:Comaittee, where he det Oswnld.” Such statement is alco incorrect. I
wea never & member, bond-fide or otherwise, of the FFCC. And my conversations with FPCC
functionaries like Steve Roberts,” an official of the Socialist Workera Party at Loa
Angeles, could hardly be construed ae a penotration. Furthermore, I had beén introduced
to Mr. Oswald long before the FFCC came into existence, albeit under an‘ansumed name.

 

 

As to. ‘the-.allusion ‘that. Io told "Bob" I was an intelligence man, not a killer,
therefore Ba “eouldn' eokibl Mrs: ‘Opwald, while the reference is true its connotation is
deceptive. I-had killed before and I. had: “participated in homicides under the auspicea of
both MI and the CIA (one instance being the part I played in the February 1958 abduction-
interrogation-murder of an FOI agent, a U.S. ‘Soldior, MSCT Emmett E. Dugan, from Crafton,
Pa., suspected of having defected in. place to the Chinase), under the guise that an
American variation of the Soviet. “wet affair" was the only alternative, that it was
either essential to .some overall _intelligence effort or in the best interests of our
national ‘security. And .it ‘was a . similar-sounding argumént, ultimately reduced to a
threat, that was advanced to me by Robert Graham ag an incéntive to diepose of ir. Oswald
in Septenbder 1963. But my refueal to do so had absolutely no bearing on the reason for

effecting my arrest in-the manner I chase, nor did it engender in we fear of reprisal by

the CIA.

 

_ Pertaining to ny arrest “and convictions at £1 Paso, Texas, which the official
spokesmen ‘and tha preashave so reatly lebeled ae being for “bank robbery,” let one of
the government's own spurious records, the aprelate court decision that finally yawned a
judgement of acquittal in my case, give its version: “The charge was then, and ie now, ‘
entoring a federally insured bank with intent-to rob." What the record aptly ignores ia
ithe’ fact that two juries, incensed by the prosecution's innuendoes in and out of the.

courtroom (and by the renificationa of: perjured testimony and a false Bureau of Prisons
_.. report made availeble to the jury during ite deliberations at the second trial = though

‘Never foraally admitted into evidence) that T was a Communiet, no doubt a very red spy,

twice convicted me of having “intended” to take by force and violence one hundred dollars

worth of Travelers Cheques” from a bank’ teller.

 

to I shall not herein. attempt to .list even generally the injustices to which I vas
subjected by. a corrupt judicial system, nor ehall I bother -to enumerate the cruelties
 

 

 

 

Jinflicted upon me while confined in sundry Texas jails and at Leavenworth Penitentiary.
Moat of them are ndequately detailed ‘in’ my. 1967 Momornndua in Support of Petition for
Writ of Habeas Corpus, sworn to-an? ‘subscribed before William -R. Kartin (a forver ‘meaber
of the CIA's Dirty Tricks Division, who by hie own adnissicn is etill in "the reserves").
But I ‘ehall opine that it Fresident ‘Kenriody hn! not ret his.denise when and: ehere he did,
T would not have been ‘brought ‘to trial on charpee of commiting a felony. : ~

While @y return to the fold of the CIA in May 1963 may have been the only “practical

": for me to do, it definitely was not predicated on my financial situation, as ‘a few
goks will substantiate (I am not quite the mercenary ‘that Mr. Lucey

“.., My aission inside East Gerzany - if indeed it wae a mission - was neithér as welts
‘defined nor ae elementary aa: Mr. Lucey has Perceived. I- am sure the CIA knows all it
meeda to khow about American defectero in Berlin and the modua operandi of the Ufs. In
fact, the mission wae not directed sgainot ‘act. Germany, per 86. Preparations bore the
trademarks of an ‘authentic, even typical, Agency project targeted in the main to another
nation... Theat I was unable to cotrrenend the Gorman languare, that I had been a recent,
unwilling quest of the U.S. Attorney. General, branded a Communist in the public records,
etc., merely. served to strengthen on already plausible cover built up by: chance rather
‘> than by design. Paradoxically, the chinks in the ‘armor wore that the cover ‘waa not -
wholly untrue, the WfS (unlike the FBI) notin the ‘least irresponsible to the laws and
polioies of ite government. In ‘the past I had engaged in certain covert intelligence
activities hositie to other socialist atatos, to which = as an integral part of ay
cover - I freely confessed. Oddly enough, however, my mentors from Langely liad negiécted
_ to tall me during the briefings that these previous activities constituted a ‘violation of
“the criminal statutes of the GDR, warranting @ aoximum penalty of death upon conviction.
By inadvertence or by plan I found ayself in a not ‘altogether unfamiliar predicament. If
Thad confeseed to my res! mission, assuming that it was genuine, without doudt I would
-have been spared execution, probably even escaped long-term iaprisonment. Instead, I

.,aelected what I considered to be a better Alternative . . « ¢ and gained ay freedom. ~ Ae
for my treatment by. the uf, “from begining to ond it was far more gentis than that

experienced beneath the cudgel of the U.S. Department of Justice.

With regard to my marital status and ay children, the foremost area that Mrs Lucey
appeare to have exploited, I. have never claimed that’ "Uncle Sam hides my family" or
atated that FBI and CIa egents. éeliderataly isolated me from ay wife and children; nor
.. have I claimed that the Agency used the promise of reuniting me with ay family as part of
the incentive for accepting the assignzent in the GDR. My accusations in this respect
centored around my children and they were leveled at the State Department as the result

of a promise made to me shortly after my release from the GDR. Since returning to the
United States last epring a reliable source has informed mo that my wife was granted a
final decree.of divorce at aone period during ay imprisonment in the USA and although I
‘have hever been served with a copy of the decree or other notification of divorce (or

notice of a divorce hearing) I see no cause to dispute the adviaement.

Lastly, concerning the aspersions cast on my sanity, at this writing permit me to
asy only ‘that I have never in ay life been certified peychatic by any U.S. aedical
‘authority .or adjudicated asntally-incompetent in a court of law, notwithstanding the
conflicting. legal-and medical opinicns aa to my mental condition on the day of ay arrest
