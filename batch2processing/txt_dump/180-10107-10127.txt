We then asked him wheter a 201 file is significant.

He said it could mean anything from the fact that someone had
an interest in the subject to being a file on an employee.
He said that PHILLIP AGEE's description of the dual 201
files on employees was correct. SMITH said that a cross
reference to the two parts does exist but only a couple

of people would have access to it, ‘He is not sure how

the cross referencing works. But in any case he said that
he doubted if we would ever see the second half of a 201
file simply because the Agency ' would not give them to us. and
would deny their existence. In response to the question:
"You mean they would lie’ to Congress?" SMITH answered:

"You represent the United States Congress but what the Hell
is that to the CIA?" He said that we probably would not
even get complete copies of the first half of a 201 file,

or any of it, if it was on a particular#Y sensitive person.

He said that if we lucked out and-learned a psuedonym
and asked for the information filed under it, "it would be
met with high suspicion" and any connection or file would
be ‘denied.

Mr, SMITH volunteered that an old friend, TOM FARMER,
was heading up the President's CIA oversight committee and
could probably ‘help us if we contacted him. He also said
that he would be glad to work for us if we needed any more
investigators.

MEMORANDUM OF INTERVIEW

To: Gary Cornwell
From: Dan Hardway
Rei Supplement to form V of interview with Joseph B. Smith.

GAETON FONZI and I interviewed Mr. JOSEPH BURKHOLDER
SMITH at his home in Jacksonville, Florida, on 19 October,
1977. SMITH is an ex-CIA agent who has published a book,
Portrait of a Cold Warrior.

Mr. SMITH First explained how his book got by the CIA™
censors. He was living in Mexico when he contacted his editor,
NED CHASE, whé is also E. HOWARD HUNT's editor. CHASE checked
SMITH out with HUNT and SMITH was contacted in this regard by
HUNT. When SMITH returned to Mexico he was contacted by a
officer who asked if he was writing a book.
He said that he was and that he would be glad to give the book
to Langly,,if they wanted it, before it publication. He did not
hear from them about it again until after the book was printed
and bound. The CIA contacted him and told him to retain a
lawyer which he did. The CIA reluctantly allowed publication.

We next asked SMITH about what motivated CIA personnel.
He said that it differed with people but that it was usually :
1) professional anti-communism; 2) super patriotism; 3)
ideological/personal (exiles); 4) pay and excitement; or 5) a
combination of any and/or all of the above. -

SMITH said that the CIA was a coherent entity. (This was
in response to a question about the tightness or looseness of
the organization.) SMITH started talking about the agency
response to crisis in general, and to investigations in
particular. He said that the Agency response is predictable.
They will set up a task force to "Handle and contain" the
crisis and/or investigation. The CIA will feel that they
are successful if they appear frank and reveal nothing.

SMITH used the Rockefeller Commission as an example of this.

He does not have any direct knowledge of this response except
in cases regarding PHILLIP AGEE's "defection" and the

student infiltration revelations and investigation. Both of
these were considered successful as were the Chuch Committee

and the Rockefeller Commission.

SMITH said that CIA personnel are seldom bothered by the
distasteful tasks they undertake (such as cover-ups)
because of the "clandestine mentality" which is drummed into
the officers until it becomes. "instinctual". SMITH said:
"When you are doing something essential for the country then
everything is okay." It was clear that he meant the national
interest as determined by the individual officer.

SMITH said he had never really believed that OSWALD had
acted alone. He said that from his vantage point in Argentina
that the story "just didn't ring true". At the time he suspectec

the Texas right wing but he now wonders about the Cubans. He
has no information about the CIA reaction to the assassination
because he was in Argentina at the time. He doubted that the
CIA was involved because KENNEDY was “backing and depending on <= ..
theCIA." When asked if KENNEDY had. support throughout the
Agency, he said that the people involved in the Bay of Pigs

were very angry with KENNEDY and "People ‘like HUNT are strange
people." He also thouth that it was possible that KENNEDY's
handling of the missile crisis was considered treasonous. Still
speaking about the Agency:'s response to the assassination

SMITH said that the Mexico City Station was very proud of
finding the picture of OSWALD. He started to talk about a

woman who worked for WIN SCOTT but he started to mumble and

very quickly changed the subject to MARITA LORENZ. He said

that he didn't believe her story but "didn't we subsidize

them for so long, maybe she had to come up with the story to get
money,”

SMITH said that the JMWAVE operation was considered very
important, so important, in fact, that DES FITZGERALD, brought
in the CIA's best black. operators, SHACKLEY and BILL HARVEY,
from Europe to run it. He said that there was a certain amount
of fanaticism among the officers at JMWAVE and the“CASTRO was

generally percieved as a "monster". The JMWAVE leaders wanted
to do a crack job. They rana lot of projects: "There was an
awful lot of wheél spinnin’ goin! on". In 1962 they were

running nightly raids on Cuba. The problem was that, in spite
of the wheel spinning and good intentions, they were inéffective.

In response to further questioning about the structure of
the CIA Cuban operation, SMITH told us that DES FITZGERALD was
brought in from the Far East Division to head up Task Force W
in early 1962. (It was called WH 4 before the Bay of Pigs. )
DES brought in ED LANSDALE and made WILLIAM HARVEY the head
of JMWAVE station. ‘HARVEY was later replaced by SHACKLEY.

Next we asked if the structure would have permitted
running operations without the knowledge of high level officials.
SMITH said that FITZGERALD and LANSDALE were "outside 6f
channels whenever they wanted to be. SMITH said that it «>
was possible that someJMWAVE operations originated with
J. C. KENG's Western Hemisphere Division. He said that KING
would have ran it as a "hip-pocket" operation through an old
friend/contact. .

FONZI then directed the conversation to E. HOWARD HUNT.
He said HUNT was “a real strange guy--conservative, bitter,
and anti-KENNEDY". He said that the source of his story
connecting HUNT and STURGIS before the Bay of Pigs was HUNT's
book, Give Us This’ Da FONZI then told him that HUNT had
very carefully avoided that in his book. SMITH was very aware
of the Rockefeller Commission. He seemed surprised by what FONZI
said and said that he “was ‘careful:not. to say anything that

hadn't already been published" about this. He said he was

sure it was published and said it was in a magazine article by
TAYLOR BRANCH which he had handy. FONZI said it wasn't in there
either and a check of the article bore him out. In response

_ to a question, SMITH said that DAVE PHILLIPS may have told him *..

the story but he doubted it. At this point SMITH started to
mumble and appeared nervous. He then said " I know I got that
from something I read" and that as soon as he found it he
would contact FONZI.

We then asked him generally about JAMES ANGELTON and how
he operated, He said that ANGELTON and most of-the Counter—
Intelligence Staff (CIS) were rabid antircommunists: "they
couldn't see the woods for the trees". ‘This colored every
thing they did. As to what they did: "God knows what he
was doing but he had the complete confidence of ALLEN DULLES".
He said that ANGELTON also often worked outside of channels.
ANGELTON started out in the OSS's Italian operation and was soon
hooked up with Israeli intelligence. ANGELTON was the head « ~
of the CEA CIS from.its inception in 1948. As an example of
ANGELTON's power, SMITH said that the Middle East Division
did not have an Israéli desk until ANGELTON retired because
he personally handled all Israeli matters.

FONZI mentioned HARVEY's duplicity in briefing his
superiors on MONGOOSE operations but not on ZRRIFLE. SMITH
said that this is an example of the rule not the exception.

FONZI then mentioned HELMS. SMITH volunteered that
everyone from the CIA who has testified is guilty of perjury.
This is because, in their view, their secrecy oath supersedes
the witness oath. It is in the best interest of the country
to commit perjury because these things should never be brought
up, let alone revealed.

FONZI next asked him if he had any information on
POSADA, CARSWELL, WERBELL, UNDERWOOD, HECTOR or EL INDIO.

The response to the first four was immediately negative. He
started ruminating about HECTOR and EL INDIO but he was soon
mumbling and showing other signs of nervousness. He finally
said that no, he didn't guess he had any information on them.

We then asked him about the way the CIA manipulated the
name files. He said that to get all the information on an
individual you would have to ask for all the information
on him and all of his psuédonyms. There is a card "key"
in the personnel (office?) files. SMITH then explained the
difference between a’ vouchered and a unvouchered funded
agent. He said that the usual procedure (above) would not
apply to unvouchered, or deep cover, agents. He said that
the Agency handled these agents' tax problems through a
contact with IRS. He said that there was a special. CIA/IRS
hankling procedure and an office. This would be the only
place where records pertaining to the particular agent would
be kept under his real name.
