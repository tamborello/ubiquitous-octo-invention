"Pursuant to the instruction to the Board of
Trustees, court proceedings have been started against
OfTILLO and Sons, Russo Trucking, Smith and Jordan, and
South Orange Express,"

"The union does not have any signed contracts with
PETER PETRIZZO or Redbird Trucking so no legal action could
be taken against these two companies,

"An informal arrangement. was worked out with Redbird
Trucking, whereby Redbird would pay its current contribution
and $250,00 per week toward its old unpaid balance of
approximately $20,000.00,

"To date the Welfare Fund has not received any
payment from Redbird Trucking, either on their current
contributions or their old unpaid balance,

"I would suggest that a signed contract be obtained
from Redbird and suit instituted,"

MARAN's preface continues to discuss several
‘other trucking concerns and the fact that they were all put
on notice that unless they paid their account a suit would
be instituted,
[____] then made available a document dated OTHER 4
March 6, 1961 directed to the trustees of the trucking employees
of the Passaic and Bergen County Welfare Fund which lists 32
companies delinquent in their payments to the Welfare Fund,

One of the firms noted was Redbird Trucking

last paid into the fund on September 3, 1960, Tie document
points out that Redbird hires a tctal of 47 men on Local 560's
union rolls, :

. It is to be noted that in MARAN's preface to his
investigative report dated March 6, 1961 he indicated that
Redbird was in arrears in the amount of $20,000,00 and that
"“informal' arrangements had been made whereby Redbird agreed

to paysits current contribution plus $250,00 towards its unpaid

contradiction to the procedures outlined in the Dental
Program Booklet..

E. Regarding the eye care phase of the Welfare
Fund Program, stated that all members of Local 560 OTHER 4
and their families are entitled to eye examination and
glasses whenever prescribed,

CL] presented the question, Why is there only

one optician, PHILLi@;APFEL and Company, 210 Fulton
—Syreck fou York fi » qualified-to-examination and make~

glasses for memb: Bt the Local? He stated that here

again when signing Checks payable to APFEL he has noticed

that APFEL has an extremely lucrative business through his

affiliations with the local and has always been curious to

know whether APFEL kickbacks a percentage of the fees

charged to representatives of the union, responsible for securing

his services, .

At that point, Larronl Brgduced a 14 page typewritten
report entitled, "Investigation and Report of Delinquent (,
Accounts for the Welfare Fund of Local 560, for the period of |: ;
February 6, through March 8, 1961 prepared by JOSEPHUIARAN, -

JR.".

[-] pointed out that MARAN is a $150.00 a week
employee working under MARVIN ZALK and is responsible for
the collection of delinquent Welfare Fund accounts, of which
there are always many.

SA LINKER reviewed MARAN's investigation report
and observed he had subheadings for each delinquent account
which included the name of the firm, the address, and the
date the account last contributed to the fund. That was
followed by a narrative stating further the date he inter-
viewed the official of the delinquent firm in an effort to
collect the funds and wherever his contact did not
result in either obtaining a check in the amount due or
he had not secured assurances from the officials to whom
he was addressing, that money was forthcoming, MARAN threatened
the individual with suit against the firm.

Two exceptions to the threat of suit were noted
during the review, the first was in his comments concerning

L__]} stated that the irony of the rate increase
is that’ as a member of the Trustee Board he continues to
refuse to pay the two cents rise in the rate and has not
been bombarded by strike threats by the union.

He stated that he did not know whether MARCHINI
or SCALETTI are paying the increasedrate, but doubts that
they are.

B. As a trustee of the Welfare Fund he signs
almost all of the Union Welfare checks payable to the physicians,

‘dentist, and the union optician.

Lad stated that he has signed checks for
as much as $12,000.00 payable to a dentist on the rolls of

the Welfare Fund for one month's services to 560 members

and their families, He stated that he possesses no conclusive
proof, but feels that theexorbitant fees charges by the
dentist must require them to kickback some per cent of the
fees to the officials responsible for their selection as a
participating dentist.

[_] stated that he was nut attempting to be
facetious when he stated that any dentist making $12,000.00
a month would be the richest man in the profession over a
period of. one year.

C. He explained that under the present system
voted by and adopted by the local, the 33 cents an hour
Welfare Fund rate is broken down as follows:

‘Eleven cents goes to the Pension Fund, approximately
six cents to. dental expenses, one cent for eye care, and the
remainder is allocated to the medical and hospital insurance
handled by the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company.

stated that he has from time to time
attempted to query MARVIN ZALK, Administrator of the Welfare
Fund, to learn the methods by which contributions from
employers ave handled and reflected; whether bills from
dentists are checked for accuracy before checks are drawn for
payment and the general. bookkeeping procedures for the funds.

politely refused to satisfy him and passed. off his questions

concerning the fund's bookkeeping operations with a statement

to the effect that every administrative procedure is handled

by h tarial force to his (ZALK's) satisfaction and

that | [need not concern himself with that phase of the OTHER 4
fund's operations.

D. [_] stated that in an effort to prove to
SA LINKER that something is radically wrong with the operations
of the fund, he preduced a three inch by six inch booklet
entitled, "Trucking Employees Welfare Fund Dental Program".
He offered the booklet to SA LINKER for his perusal and
pointed out that page seven of the booklet reads as follows:
"with this authorization card (referring to the members of
the Program). you will receive a list of names, addresses and
telephone numbers of the participating dentists and the
dental. plan office",

"Call the participating dentist you select for an
appointment. You will. get. a prompt appointment and we
assure you that you will be treated with the utmost courtesy".

Upon completing the review of the booklet, |]
pointed out that to his knowledge no member of Local

has ever been furnished a list of participating dentists.

He stated that in order to prove his point he would call
Doctor LEO MARCUS, the Administrator of the Progran,
at the Local's 591 Summit Avenue office and stated
that he would pretext the call by indicating to MARCUS that
many of his employees have requested that a list of the
fund's participating dentists and their addresses be: posted
at the terminal in order to save time, in selecting dentists
of their choice,

[____]ealled MARCUS' office, telephone number
OL 3-4330, in the presence of SA LINKER and asked fo Doctor
MARCUS, When informed that MARCUS was out, identified
himself to MARCUS' secretary and proceeded to explain the
pretext. Upon completion of the call stated that
she informed him that a list of the participating dentists
was not available to the men and that they were required to
first appear in Doctor MARCUS’ office for examination and that
they were then assigned to a dentist by Doctor MARCUS,

He pointed out that this policy was a clear

On March 15, 1961, pcx[__,
owner of the Passaic Terminal and Transportation Company,

Inc., Bloomfield Avenue, Allwood, New Jersey (a large local
Cartage Agent) advised SA NORBERT R, LINKER, that he is one
of three representatives of management on the six man
Board of Trustees of the Passaic and Bergen County Branch
of Local 560's Welfare Fund. He stated that in this capacity
as a Trustee he meets with all of the union officials and
fellow board members as often as twice a month at the
union's Welfare Fund Office, 591 Summit Avenue, Jersey City,
New Jersey. He related that the board is presently composed
of ZIGMUND PSKOWSKI, also known as "ZIGGIE"; JOSEPH SANTIELLO,
; ‘also known as "STIXIE", and EDWARD HUGHES, all of whom
. \ represent Local 560; ALBERT SCALETTI, owner of trucking

- He advised that JACOB FRIEDLAND, attorney for the
local, attends the board meetings and presides over disputes
arising over welfare rates, medical eligibility problems
and many Operational procedures,

(—_]stated that although unable to prove his |
suspicions at this time he believes that the funds assigned
to the Welfare Fund are being misappropriated by the
recipient of the monies before they, are disbursed to insurance
companies, dentists, etc., or they are returned to the union
officials in the form of a kickback.

ALETTI and MARCHINI readily agreed to accept
» employee contribution rate, demanded by
PROVENZANO and PSKOWSKI even though it meant that a two cents
loss would eventually be incurred by every owner operator
within the sphere of the local,

explained that practically all trucking
‘company employees must now contribute 33 cents per hour,
eight hours u day, five days a week, to the Welfare Fund
for every member of Local 560, which the firm employs. He
stated that a large firm such as his must therefore contribute
| as much as $25,000.00 a year, or more into a fund which they
cannot audit to determine how the funds are spent.
