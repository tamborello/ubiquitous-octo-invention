Observations

According to CG sas} subject, although she had
reportedly broken away froth the CP, USA, continues to express
interest in the activities of the CP, USA. However, she
continues to express interest in the PLP and although she
denied being a member of the PLP admitted writing articks

for them, speaking in their behalf and being sympathetic to
the organization. She is al interested in the activities
of the extreme left groups. >

Prior to her trip to London and Paris during

August, 1968, subject had indicated to jcc sources e b

could obtain the truth concerning RITTENBERG et CR)
>)

In view of subject's remarks to CGf5851-S re
RITTENBERG et al and her trip's to London and™PaYris and
subsequently Mexico City, it appears subject communicates
with the Chinese Communists or pro-Chinese Communist
organizations in contact with CHICOMS, while abroad.

progressive in a youth movement, which was not composed of workers. - ?

no longer a member of the PLP. UY ‘
