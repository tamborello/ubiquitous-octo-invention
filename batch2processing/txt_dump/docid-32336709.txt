On 6/3/65 was contacted
at his request and furnished the following information
to SA JOSEPH E, SCULLY:

——e said that he first became associated
with the Second, National Front of Escambray (Alpha 66) (SNFE)
while he was a student at Earlham,College in Richmond,
Indiana. He described himself at that time as idealistic
and with complete faith in the SNFE.. After coming to
Washington, D.C., he became aware that although he was the
Washington,D.C, representative of that organization he was
never fully taken into its confidence, He also attempted
to learn something of the organizations military plans
(Plan Omega) but were answered in only general
and vague terms. was unable to eite? specific
reasons but he began to doubt that money collected. and ra

v

equipment obtained was put to the use for which it was
intended.

| ] wa Hey acet tions Wy disillusioned by the
capture of ELOY GUTTERRE OYO, Leader of the SNFE, and
his subsequent public confessions on television in Cuba where
he implicated other members of the organization.
also noted that shortly wafter= >.» ME ' hension
many Cubans in Cuba were arrested and feels that
there may have been a connection. between MENOYO's apprehension
and these arrests, The above, coupled with the general
questionable background of MENOYO with regard to his early
association with FIDEL CASTRO raised serious doubts concerning
MENOYO himself. Lidia developed a suspicion that
MEHUYO may have been a CASTRO man or at least motivated by
personal gain rather then by concern for fre country | £ Cuba.
