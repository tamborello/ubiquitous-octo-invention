This reviews an article concerning the assassination of
President Kennedy in the March, 1964, issue of "Saga" magazine by
former Special Agent William W. Turner (E.0.D. 2~5-51 - Dismissed
7-19-61 ) who is presently appealing his dismissal before the Circui
Court in the District. Turner's self-centered, embittered, illogica
attitude is wel] known to us and his article is what we might expect

ah : Da :

Turner attempts to argue that the yr the assassination -”
- should be laid to FBI bungling by way of not prewarning the Secret Service-
of Oswald's potential as an assassin and that the cause of this was a ~~
lack of cooperation and communication between the Bureau and the "
Secret Service. In the lead paragraph of the article, Turner claims
that he went-to Dallas "just a few hours" after the assassination to
conduct a. personal FBI-type inquiry as he sensed that "there were too
many questions unanswered, too much information concealed." This is

patently crystal-ball nonsense and at the outset shows his true

motivation, In light of his stated conviction that Oswald was indeed
the assassin and that he acted on his own without left wing, rig
or crime syndicate plotting, the article is particularly -victous ;
suggestion that someone other than Oswald is basically to be bl
the deed. Turner's case is pure sophistry the inaccuracies’. of /which
[ise hereinafter reviewed point by point. His argument consistsiof part

fact, largely inaccurate and irresponsible newspaper reports: and Qo
outright falsehoods. He endeavors to lend credence to his argument 5
by trading on his past experience as a Bureau Agent and it is in this 4
realm that he clearly lies in discussing Bureau investigative techniques 5.
jin this case. He concludes his article with a four-point appeal to D>

effect that 1. Presidential appearances henceforth not be in open cars
and that the President be required to wear a bullet-proof vest when
-|appearing in public. *2. That an attempt on the President's life be
made a Federal offense. 3. That President's route in andout of city
not be publicized and 4. That a permanent Federal Commission be
established to insure proper cooperation and communication between

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan
Re: LEE HARVEY OSWALD a aestiya
105-82555 pee

Seu l

Statement {Oswald prudently transferred his political activities to
New Orleans (date not indicated) as Dallas is a city that
leans to the right and because of local Dallas police
vigilance against communist-type activity.

 
   

Fact:|Oswald left Dallas and traveled to New Orleans in late April,
i 1963, as he was out of work and at the urging of his wife due to
his having attempted to assassinate General Walker on April 10,
1963. The inference that Oswald feared Dallas police vigilance
is nonsense for he returned to the Dallas area five months later

to 1ive.>

Statement;:/\It is FBI responsibility to make dissemination to
n ecret Service but there is historical evidence that proper
issemination is not always made at the Washington level.
In support he :cites: that in 1945 the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police (RCMP) told the Bureau about Klaus Fuchs
wo who they suspected was a Soviet agent, however, the FBI
took no action. He also ‘cites: that in 1960 the FBI
collected damaging information about Bernon F. Mitchell
and William H. Martin, National Security Agency (NSA)
: employees, and again failed to alert anyone after which
Mitchell and Martin fled to Cuba thence to Russia where
iithey compromised U. S, \Secret codes throughout the world.

Fact|The name of Fuchs and his British address came to attention of
RCMP after arrest of Israel Halperin in February, 1946, as a
result of the disclosures of Igor Gouzenko, Soviet Code Clerk
who defected in Canada in 1945, Halperin, a Canadian, was
named by Gouzenko as‘a member of a Soviet military intelligence
network in Canada. fFuchs' name and his address in England vere in

n address hook and diary in Halperin's possession, The book
-'|and diary were furnished to the Bureau on 3-12-46 and names and
.|Bddresses of ‘Americans appearing in the documents were furnished

oO the field: The documents were furnished by the Canadians to.

lto° British and no action was ken by the Bureau with respect

to individuals living abroad.. chs first became an espionage
suspect in 1949 on the basis of reau Source | information (not CS)
to be disseminated). We, however, advised the British and in £4}
January, 1950, Fuchs’ confessed in England to his espionage
activities. When Mitchell and Martin defected to the Soviets

in June, 1960, we had never conducted any investigation $ )

them nor had we received any allegations’ Goncerning them
