Dear Joseph,

Please accept my appreciation for an assignment
well done as a member of the FY 1978 GS-07 Secretarial/
Clerical DO Personnel Evaluation Boards from 17 April
through 19 May 1978,

I well) recognize the complexities involved in the
comparative’ evaluation of [/ Jelerical carcerists --

a task further cemplicated by this being only the second
year it has‘been undertaken, Your deliberations were
vital to the Dircctorate's determination to bring to this
group of valuable employces the advantages of the merit

systen.

Full-time service with the Evaluation Boards
represents a major contribution to the Directorate's
program of personnel assessment and management. Not
only were your promotion recommendations valued, but
recommendations for career development and training

were also extremely helpful.

I believe that your service on the Board broadened
and sharpened your own focus on personnel aspects of
Agency management, Too, I think that the time spent
in this endeavor could only have made you better aware
of our need for complete, careful and candidly written

appraisals of our employees.

Sincerely,

oo? 7
