Dear John:

In addition to its requests of June 20 and June 28, the ARRB will need information on the names,
pseudonyms and crypts appearing on the attached brief list in order to prepare for its July 17-18
Board Meeting. As with the previous lists, we would appreclate your sending “clear and
convincing” evidence in support of the Agency’s recommendation to postpone release,
including short descriptions of each crypt, a brief identification of each individual (including
what that person was doing for the CIA in 1963-64, whether the name Is a true name or a
pseudonym), and indications of whether these crypts, operations, and individuals are presently
active or inactive. As we have discussed, the Board in particular needs to know, in specific
terms, what evidence CIA can provide for those cases where release would endanger personal
safety, ongoing intelligence Operations, or current foreign relations. To help with your search,
we have included document numbers where these names and crypts are found. —

We are also enclosing copies of the first pages of two documents for which your staff needed
further identification.

Thank you for your cooperation,
Sincerely yours,
vid G. Marwell

Executive Director
