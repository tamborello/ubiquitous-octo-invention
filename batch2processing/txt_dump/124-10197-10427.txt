could contact him. ( .)

"MORALES told “HeaR AS it was necessary for
them to stop commerce with Cuba. HUERTAS said he could
accomplish this through diplomatic. means. Later MORALES
became discouraged with HUERTAS' lack of action and ..
apparently started to operate on his own. MORALES
spent a month working out an alibi. (i UW
