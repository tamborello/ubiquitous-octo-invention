from a Cuban fishing vessel might be an individual who had prev ious}
been seen in Miami during November or December 1968, At the same
time, ANCARDON~1 pointed out that he was suspicious and thought
that these telephone calls indicated that GUIROLA was not a bona

was being used as @ means of. creating an incident which would
embarrass the GOC, ag a result of their fishing boats penetrating
