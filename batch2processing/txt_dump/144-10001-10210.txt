Doe Ref 1D: A4269471 os
_° GELBERTO POLICARPO LOPEZ aka crianeto Miz RODRIGUEZ

Born January 26, 1940, in Havana Cuba.

Lopez allegedly was at the home of Mary Quist in Tampa,
Florida, on November 17, 1963, awaiting a telephone call from
Cuba. The telephone call supposedly was to pive him the.

"go ahead order" to Leave the United States. Lopez apparently
teceived such a telephone call sometime between November 17
end November 20, because on the latter date he obtained an
entry permit for Mexico.

A Mrs. Manuel (Christina) Amor, 8407 39th Street,

Tampa, Florida, telephoned sometime after 5:00 a.m, on

Dec2mber 8, 1963, a friend in Cuba named Teresa and was told

Lopez had arrived safely in Cuba via Texas and Mexico.
