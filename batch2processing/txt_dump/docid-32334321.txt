As the Gureau and Keaasas City have previously
been advised, New Orieans is of the opinion that the
"Winutemen"” unit in Bogalusa, La., may aot in any way be
connected with the national arganization headed by ROBERT
DEPUGH of Norborue, Missouri. NO 127188 has been attempting
to ascertain whether this unit at Eogalusa is connected with
the national organization by requesting from the leaders
“Minutemen” literature so that the members could read about
the organization. NO 127l-R has advised that te hes been
inforaed that the Local unit does not have any literature
for the reason this is one way the F31 car identify the
wenbers, NG i27ieR has advised that he believes the leaders
ef this unit at Bogalusa have merely taken the naze of the
national organization to suit their own purposes.

The New Grieans Office has separste 157 files opened
on each one of the above-listed individusis with the exception
of irs, HOLLOHAN, and NO 1271-% is still attempting to ascer-
tain any connection between the nationsl organization and the
