"The question of assassination, particularly of Fidel
Castro, was brought up by Secretary McNamara at the
meeting of the Special Group (Augmented) in Secretary
Rusk's office on 10 August. It was the obvious con-
sensus at that meeting, in answer to a comment by Mr.
Ed Murrow, that this is not a subject which has been
made a matter of official record. I took careful notes
on the comments at this meeting on this point, and the
Special Group (Augmented): is not expecting any written
comments or study on this point." (Lansdale Ex. 16).

coment in writing in such a document.”

"(2) To disassociate US from any obvious inter- -
vention in Dominican Republic and even more so
from any political assassination which might

Memo, Bowles to Bundy

"Following up on our discussion of the Dominican
Republic at yesterday's meeting of the Special
Group, I am forwarding you a draft telegram which
we would like to send to Henry Dearborn, our Consul
General in Ciudad Trujillo, supplementing the
guidance he will be receiving on the recently
approved contingency plans.”

Cable, Smith & Clifton to Bundy & O'Donnell °

". . . we must not run risk of U.S. association with
political assassination, since U.S. as matter of
general policy cannot condone assassination. This
last principal is overriding and must prevail in
doubtful situation." "Continue to inform dissident

elements of U.S. support for their position."
Cable, Station to Headquarters

"HOS aware extent to which U.S. government already
associated with assassination. If we are to at

least cover up tracks, CIA personnel directly involved
in assassination preparation must be withdrawn.”

that they be provided with a limited number of
small arms for their own protection (specifically,
five M3 .45 caliber SMGs)."

a memorandum be prepared for higher authority on
the subject of what plans can be made for a
successor government to Trujillo."

Berle memo of conversation

"On cross examination it developed that the
real plan was to assassinate Trujillo and they
wanted guns for that purpose. Herbert wanted
to know what the policy should be.

"I told him I could not care less for Trujillo
and that this was the general sentiment. But we
did not wish to have anything to do with any
assassination plots anywhere, any time. Herbert
said he felt the same way.”

"The DCL referred to recent reports of a new
anti-Trujillo plot. He said we never know if

one of these is going to work or not, and asked
what is the status of contingency planning should

is covered in a Cuba paper which will be discussed
at a high level in the very near future.”

"Gen. Cabell [Deputy DCI] noted that the internal
dissidents were pressing for the release to them
of certain small arms now in U. S. hands in the
Dominican Republic. He inquired whether the
feeling of the Special Group remained that these
arms should not be passed. The members showed no
inclination to take a contrary position at this
time." (Emphasis supplied)

State Department Document, Select Committee No. 313

"1. The USG should not lend itself to direct
political assassination.

2. US moral posture can ill afford further
tarnishing in the eyes of the world.

3. We would be encouraging the action, supplying
the weapons, effecting the delivery, and. then
turning over only the final execution to
(unskilled) local triggermen.

4. So far we have seen no real evidence of action
capability. Should we entrust ourselves and
our reputation to this extent in the absence

' thereof?

5. Can we afford a precedent which may convince
the world that our diplomatic pouches are used
to deliver assassination weapons?"

ment they can be assured that any reasonable request
for assistance from the U. S. will be promptly and

favorably answered."

lL. 4/24/60 Memo, Sec. of State Herter to President Eisenhower

"the United States would immediately take political
action to remove Trujillo from the Dominican Republic
as soon as a suitable successor can be induced to
take over with the assurance of U. S. political,
economic, and -- if necessary -~ military support.”

Z.. 6/28/60 Memo, CIA to J. C. King

"co, Would it provide a small number of sniper
rifles or other devices for the removal of key
Trujillo people from the scene?"

3. 7/1/60 CIA memo

"Providing the arms as requested would contribute
significantly toward this end."

4. 10/3/60 CIA memo

"a, Delivery. of approximately 300 rifles and
pistols together with ammunition and a supply of
grenades, to secure cache on the South shore of the
island, about 14 miles east of Ciudad Trujillo.

"bh, Delivery, to the same cache described above,

of an electronic detonating device with remote
control features, which could be planted by the
dissidents in such manner as to eliminate certain

key Trujillo henchmen. This might necessitate train-
ing and introducing into the country by illegal entry
a trained technician to set the bomb and detonator."

"the proposed actions would not, of themselves

bring about the desired result in the near

future lacking some decisive stroke against Trujillo
himself."

6. 1/12/61 Special Group Minutes

"Mr. Merchant explained the feeling of the Depart-
ment of State that limited supplies of small arms

and other material should be made available for
Aissidents inside the Dominican Republic. Mr. Parrott
said that we believe this can be managed securely by
CIA, and that the plan would call for final trans-. .
portation into the country being provided by the '
dissidents themselves. The Group approved the
project."

Memo, Mann to Merchant

"Opposition elements have consistently asked us to
supply them with "hardware" of various types. This
has included quantities of conventional arms and
also, rather persistently, they have asked for

some of the more exotic items and devices which
they associate with revolutationary effort."

Memo, Scott to Merchant

"agreed in terms of Tom Mann's memo"
Cable, Dearborn to Devine
"delighted" “exotic equipment."

CIA memo

"the key to the success of the plot [to overthrow
the Trujillo regime] would be the assassination

of Trujillo."
CIA memo

"(a) Ex-FBI agents who would plan and execute

the death of Trujillo.

(b) ‘Cameras and other items that could be used
to fire projectiles.

(c) A chemical that could be rubbed on the palm
of one's hand and transferred to Trujillo in
a handshake, causing delayed lethal results.

(da) Silencers for rifles that could kill froma
distance of several miles. (Id.)"

CIA memo

". , . the members of our club are now prepared in
their minds to have a picnic but do not have the
ingredients for the salad. Lately they have
developed a plan for the picnic, which just might
work if they could find the proper food. They have
asked us for a few sandwiches, hardly more, and we
are not prepared to make them available. Last week
we were asked to furnish three or four pineapples
for a party in the near future but I could remember
nothing in my instructions that would allow me to
contribute this ingredient. Don't think I wasn't
tempted. I have rather specific guidelines to the
effect that salad ingredients will be delivered
outside the picnic grounds and will be brought to
the area by another club." :
