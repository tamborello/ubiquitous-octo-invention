MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM TALKING TO
AMERICANS, AND NAMED C/O’S DERSOOKIAN AND BECKNAP WHOM HE HAD
MET THROUGH J/1.

3. DURING THE CONVERSATION, J/1 SAID HE HEARD AN AUDIBLE

"CLICK" WHICH HE IS SURE WAS THE SOUND OF A TAPE RECORDER

‘ SHUTTING OFF. J/1 SAID HE IGNORED THE. SOUND, BUT BO’

_ AND HOSTESS WERE SHOCKED.BY THE NOISE. J/1 SAID THA
SEEMED TO BE ALL BUSINESS THAT EVENING, ASKING QUESTIONS AND
LEADING THE CONVERSATION. WHEN J/1 PHONED HIM ON 13 SEP WITH A
PHONE_NUMBER HE HAD REQUESTED,[_]SEEMED TENSE. ON 15
SEP, CAME BY TO SEE J/1 AT HIS OFFICE, AGAIN REFERRING
TO HIM AS HIS BROTHER. WAS BACK TO HIS PREVIOUSLY
FRIENDLY SELF AND ASKED J/1 WHAT HE WAS DOING OVER THE WEEKEND
AND J/1. SAID HE WAS VERY BUSY. J/1'S IMPRESSION IS THAT HE WAS
BEING TESTED AND THAT HE PASSED THE TEST. C/O WOULD
CONSULT THE WASHINGTON EXPERTS AND ADVISE J/1 AT.NEXT MEETING
WHICH IS, SCHEDULED FOR 1500 ON 24 SEP. WOULD APPRECIATE HOS
‘COMMENTS PRIOR TO THAT MEETING.

4. DURING THE meeTiING,[__|roLD 9/1 THAT HE WANTED THE
BIBLE FOR HIMSELF SINCE HE WAS CATHOLIC. HE SAID THAT
PREVIOUSLY, PARTY MEMBERS COULD NOT BE RELIGIOUS AND REMAIN
PARTY MEMBERS. HOWEVER, THINGS HAD LIBERALIZED TO THE POINT
WHERE HE COULD.NOW HAVE A.BIBLE. (3/1 DID ADMIT THAT HE FORGOT
‘TO ASK WHY, IF THINGS WERE MORE LIBERAL NOW, COULD NOT
GET HIS OWN BIBLE FROM CUBA.)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 J/1 SAID THAT BASED ON HIS ASSESSMENT

WOULD NOT GET FAR WITH HIM USING OFFICIAL AMERICANS.
HE SAID HOWEVER, THAT A SOUTH AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN INTERESTED
IN TRADE IN CUBA (SPECIFICALLY IMPORT/EXPORT) WOULD BE OF
INTEREST AS HE HAS EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN LEAVING
THE GOVERNMENT AND INVOLVING HIMSELF IN BUSINESS DEALINGS. J/1
ASSESSES AS BEING INTERESTED IN MONEY (HENCE THE
INTEREST IN’ BUSINESS), BUT STILL RETAINING’ AN INTEREST IN

 

 

 

 

 

 

POLITICS. C/O TOLD J/1 THAT STATION AND HQS STILL HAD AN

 

INCOMPLETE PICTURE OF PERSONALITY AND THAT HE SHOULD
CONTINUE WITH HIS ASSESSMENT. C/O AGAIN TR ¥Y OF
HAVING J/1 WRITE A LETTER TO C/O DESCRIBING S IF c/o

HAD NEVER MET HIM. J/1 SAID HE WOULD TRY TO DO THAT.

6. STATION ASSESSMENT OF THESE RECENT EVENTS IS TWOFOLD.
IT IS LIKELY THAT[ HAS REPORTED HIS CONTACT WITH C/o’S
DERSOOKIAN AND BECKNAP. IT IS POSSIBLE THEN THAT A SECURITY
OFFICIAL INSISTED THAT CONFIRM HIS VERSION OF THE
CONTACT WITH 3/1. THE EVENTS OF 9
.SEP WOULD. SUPPORT THIS THEORY, ESPECIALLY THE OBVIOUS AGENDA
AND THE SHOCK AT THE MIX-UP WITH THE TAPE RECORDER (THIS IS NOT
A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL CONDUCTING A TEST.) ANOTHER POSSIBILITY
IS THAT THIS WAS A-TEST FOR J/1, A SORT OF VETTING EXERCISE.
SINCE CAME BACK TO J/1 AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, IT
WOULD APPEAR THAT J/1 PASSED THE TEST. THE QUESTION REMAINS AS
TO WHO WAS ABLE TO REVIEW THE TAPE IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF
SECRET
