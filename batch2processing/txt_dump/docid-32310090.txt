cu) Well, I'm not sure that that isn't actually gonna be the route
cause, - » working as we did... that's a practical state. ..
and on the other hand I've never seen, you know you talk about
clannishness up in New Hampshire or the clannishness out on
say North Shore in Chicago. Those people are all related to
each other and unless you're in, you're out. Now that would
be true. . they wouldn't like Jimmy but they're not gonna like
Bobby either.

(M) One thing that concerns me though is when we talked in Washington
. . and talked about the possibility of Chicago and so on... .

(M) I can't see how it's gonna do one darn bit of good to have the
fix in Chicago, If he gets convicted in Tennessee, because
- from Tennessee it.comes to Chicago and with a recent felon,
he's had it. No matter how much your Judge might help...
because under those circumstances . .,. it's just too soon, ,.

Inaudible

(M) .. .‘At least we can keep track of it in Chicago because
we'll be in a position to help . ,. . apparently they're just
not sure that the one down South is right on the line...
Inaudible —

(Vv) I don't think it's helped him a lot to get it moved.

(Mt) Well, I think as a matter of fact it’s probably hurt because oe e
little town . 2. .

(uM) Sort of a home town thing where everybody knows everybody and
. there is certainly no industry there compared to Nashville ...
law of’ averages get friendlier ...

Inaudible
(M) . . . and anybody that's on the bench down there is gonna listen ,
. . which:is from that point of view a practical thing but it bothers

me cause he's gotta come out of Tennessee without a, conviction
otherwise when he comes to Chicago , . «

(M) I think that it could be done, I really do . , ah . . and it

gotta move and move fast.

(V) It can't be done by Jimmy, it's got to be done by somebody ....
(M) else that's in an entirely different industry, you as a banker

(M) I agree absolutely . .. it better be somebody . . that can

nothing to do with the situation down in Chattanooga at all but

(V) Like, any idea?

(M) Well, I would just guess, I would think that . . ah .. to
delude the top guy would cost a quarter of a million bucks.
Maybe even half a million, Campaign contributions I don't
think they're interested in, I think they'd be interested in
real money. Maybe .. . on a COD basis, that way you know
somebody doesn't get paid before they get ... ah . cause
they work on the honor system down there anyway, they always
have , . but that the only way ..., the reason I know is that
even though we have this bankruptcy in. . . all. kinds of .
interstate highway stuff and you have to be qualified... - bd
qualified . ..so. . and they just sit down and say well
okay . . they're looking for cash . . you're in the country
or out of it, they don't. care but that's it, No hitches, no
problems,

Inaudible
(M) You think you can get them to come up with that money...
(M) Did you ever talk to Jimmy about this
