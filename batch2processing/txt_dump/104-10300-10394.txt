STATEMENT BY {

 

I had originally helped with a FOIA request. She
had a list of approximately ten names (aTT AKA's of OSWALD) she. needed
searched on SANCA. I checked each of the names, went over them with
her to make certain they were relevant to the FOIA case and made a copy

from SANCA, for her, of all names searched. One of the names searched
was OSWALD, HARVEY LEE. There was one hit: a reference to OSWALD, HARVEY

_LEE in Security File Number 269298. The subject of SFN 269298 is
KRUPNOV, KIM GEORGIYEVICH and the file is maintained permanently in OS/SAG.

A short time later (perhaps two weeks) I received a request for
the Security file on KRUPNOV, KIM GEORGIYEVICH. I remembered we had a
file on him but searching SANCA I kept getting ‘no hits'. I asked the
Chief/Indicies about it and she said_if it was there two weeks ago, it”
should be there now. I then asked{  ———————sfabout it and fe agreed
to check the original FOIA case. He pulled the case and tried %o
explain to me whey there were 'no hits’ on the name I was searching.
Unfortunately, as a new employee I was unable to understand the reason.
Today I can see that it's simply a matter of entering incorrect data
into SANCA.. Any deviation, however slight, will result in ‘no hits'

-because the computer will give you exactly what you ask for--nothing

more. Apparently the second request had the name spelled incorrectly
and although I tried quite a few variations, I never got it exactly

-correct. I'm completely satisfied now that nothing irregular occurred

and that the only reason I couldn't find the file the second time was
because I was given an incorrect spelling of the subject's name.
