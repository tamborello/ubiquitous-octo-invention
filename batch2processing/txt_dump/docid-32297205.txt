The three individuals began discussing the

VALACHI's testimony was all hearsay, and that nothing
would comé out of bt, However, NOONAN offéred to ‘bet
GLEASON that moxe than one indictment "comes out™ of
the VALACHI testimony... GLEASON remarked "what do
those guys care about that" referrins to members of
Cosa Nostra. NOONAN indicated it would "cost those
guys a fartune", and to which GLEASON remarked "they.
got it," .

: TEDDY GLEASON ‘then. remarked that TOMMY
(GLEASON, JR.) is ‘ng. to sue the Waterfront Gotmission,
the newspaper, and ak ‘the: writexs for the story that _
appeared in the papers eoneerning allegations that TOMMY
GLEASON has profited from ILA business because of his
father, TEDDY GLEASON. TEDDY GLEASON remarkéd that a

Was going to Washington, and GLEASON indicated "ne", and
that he was going to talk to the executive board Riday
about that, :

It is noted that N¥ 4091-Pc has advised that
