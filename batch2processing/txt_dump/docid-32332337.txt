the Chicago Office for a number of years as the Bureau

is aware, and undoubtedly had this individual's informant
status become known to the underworld, his effectiveness
would have long since ceased.

VITO NITTI is the subject of a case involving
counterfeit series E bonds and Bank of America Express
Checks. In connection with this charge, NITTI surrendered
‘himself to the United States Marshal's Office, Chicago;
however, he subsequently refused to furnish any information
to Chicago FBI Agents in regard to the counterfeit matter
or other criminal matters.

No informant or confidential source of the
Chicago Office has ever furnished information indicating
. _-that information provided by FBI informants or sources
~ are available to the hoodlum element. To the contrary,
: sources have advised that hoodlums in Chicago have taken
for granted that they "cannot get to the FBI."

As the Bureau is aware, an incident occurred
during the past month whereby a United States Secret
Service Agent named ABRAHAM BOLDEN was charged with
attempting to sell a Secret Service report to a minor
hoodium for $50,000. The incident received a great deal
of publicity and the bribery was referred to in some
newspaper accounts as involving "Government Reports".

In” regard to this publicity, this is a possibility for
the above allegation.
