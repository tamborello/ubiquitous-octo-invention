ReBuairtel 8/25/64 requesting Phila. to advise
the Bureau by return communication precautions taken to
insure that PH 701-C? is not compromised,

As the Bureau is aware; PH 701-C* was installed
‘utiligangen altered telephone instrument. This instrument
affords the best security available in this type of in-
stallation.

BUPALINO as is known from previous information
furnished by PH 623-C* is suspicious of any telephone
instrument. For example, he has advised PH 665-C-TE to
be extremely cautious in using the telephone and not
ro » necessarily the telephone involved with PH 701-C*. He

“ does, however, even after cautioning PH 665-¢-TE, talk
freely with this informant.

' BUPALINO made the comment that he thought his

} telephone was tapped during a telephone cenversation. It
appears, therefore, that BUFALING is not suspicious of -
coverage being afforded by PH 7O1-¢€* but is suspicious =
of telephones being "tapped." ‘

Resident Agents in Wilkes-Barre have Previously
been advised and were again reminded on 8/26/64 to be
alert for any information that might develop which would :
indicate that this source had been compromised, Employees ie
handling the Central Plant in regard to PH 701-¢@* were
_ again on 8/2 6/64 reminded to be alert for this type of
information. This is stendard procedure but has been re-
