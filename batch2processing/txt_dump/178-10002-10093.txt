just turned out to be a very difficult thing and I agree that
he was kept an inordinate amount of time.
Q Was it your feeling that there was just simply no

satisfactory provision of American law to handle this kind

of case?
A There really is not, sir.
Q And that was your feeling at that time?
A Yes. And I don't know of any even now.

Q° Did you feel that the Agency had in good faith
exhausted all alternatives that appeared to be open to it?

. A Yes. I really thought so. We spent a lot of time
on this case.

Q To try to find a legal or proper way to handle it?

A That is right. Proper solution to it.

Q Was it the conclusion of the Agency that Mr.
Nosenko just simply could not be released?

A That is right. If he was a Russian spy then we
just found ourselves not in a position to be able to certify
that he was not. | .

Q Wasn't there some procedure that was available to
the Government of the United States with respect to deporting
him if his bona fides couldn't be determined in a reasonable
period of time?

Q © I don't know whether this device has ever been

used. I am not familiar with it.

BY MR. ROETHE: ;
Q I take it, if you deported him you would be placing
his life in considerable danger.
A There was always that problem. You know, I don't

think we have ever deported any defectors no matter how much

x
\

of a nuisance and pain in the neck they have been. The only
ones that have gone back are the ones that asked to go back.
Q Do you recall who was made privy to this particular
arrangement under which Mr. Nosenko was being held? Was the
White House privy. to this? . : pe
A 7 Oh, I couldn't ~-

Q Was the Congress privy to it?

 

A I wouldn't have. thought so. I don't remember ever

discussing it with the Congress.

~O You do. recall discussing it with the Attorney
General?

A Yes, the Deputy Attorney General, he was at that
time.

Q Was -he told of the specific conditions under which

Mr. Nosenko was being held?

A I. really don't remember all the details of the
session at that time, whether there were some other gentlemen
with me and we had just a general discussion of this case.

Q Were you aware of the specific conditions under

which he was being held?

Q Can you tell us what your impressions were as to
the justification of the Agency in retaining for such an
extended period of time the physical custody and person of
Mr. Nosenko? .

A We were simply trying to establish his bona fides
one way or the other. We took a very long time and had a

very hard time doing it for reasons, detailed reasons which

I don't recall, but I certainly remember that this was a

very difficult case for us. I even believe we went down to
talk to Mr.Katzenbach when he was the. Deputy Attorney General
in an effort to see if there was any way we could get assist-
ance from’ the Department of Justice about what our responsi-
bilities or our authorities or anything else where in the
case of a defector who put himself in our hands who might be
a spy on the United States and what we could do to somehow
get this whole thing sorted out. ‘Needless to say, the
Department of Justice wasn't able to help us. Since we. had
the responsibilities for handling defectors in this country
and we also had the responsibilities for establishing their
bona fides, this was the reason that he was held for so long.
We tried various things. I. remember that I asked one of my
Deputies who was then Admiral Rufus Taylor who had been
Director of Naval Intelligence before,to spend full time
attempting to sort out this case, see what we should do next

about it, how we could get it regularized, et cetera. It

9 in convincing them to leave it out?

iM MR. ROETHE: This is in fact a memorandum you
3 12 _ prepared for the records, isn't it, on your talk with the
1s Chief Justice and that is dated June 24, 1964? .
5 14 THE WITNESS: Well, if it was June 1964, then
15 Nosenko must have defected before that.

Agency. that directed what was to be done with him and
conducted the interrogations of him and specified the condi-
tions under which he was to be kept, and so on?

A Right. |

Q Does that refresh your recollection?

A That helps a great deal because he was held down in

the installation we have here some miles from Washington for

quite some months while an effort was.being made to find

out whether he was a bona fide defector or not a bona

fide defector and one of ‘the complicating factors as I

recall it was that he had made some sort of statement to the
FBI when he arrived in this country that he was going to
become a part of the Warren Commission report and we could
not seem to ascertain clearly enough that the fellow was what .
he claimed to be and, therefore, the statement might have been|
contaminated and might have affected the conclusions of the
Warren Commission. So I think this case went on for a long
time in our efforts to get all of this sorted out. But I
remember this was important enough that I sought a conversa-

tion with the Chief Justice who was Chairman of the Warren

- Commission and talked to him, you know, one afternoon -- I

don't know if it was morning or afternoon but I talked to

him in some detail about this matter privately so that the

Warren Commission would not necessarily be misled by this

man's testimony which we were not able to vouch for.

had done by having the liaison officer come back and forth

and my recollection is that I advocated that we just sort

of wait it out and see what happened.

MR. OLSEN: Did it enter into your thinking in
that connection, Ambassador, that little could be done by
attempting to compel Mr. Hoover to do anything in any event?

THE WITNESS: I didn't think there was a chance-of
Attorneys General being able to persuade him to reverse
himself.

MR. ROETHE: Do you want to go into a different
area now? |

MR. OLSEN: Yes.

. MR. ROETHE: I will sort of rest my thought here
for a few minutes. .

BY MR. OLSEN:

Q Are you acquainted with the general subject of the
handling of a defector by the name of Nosenko?

A Yes.

Q Did. Nosenko defect.to the United States at the
time you were the DCI? .

A I have forgotten exactly what my job was when he
defected. Could you give me the date when he defected?

MR. ROETHE: I believe it was in 1965. I think it
was just before you --

THE WITNESS: Became Deputy Director?
