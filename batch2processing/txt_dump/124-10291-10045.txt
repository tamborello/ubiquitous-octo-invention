KNOWLEDGE. FOR THIS REASON, THE MEETING WAS ARRANGED TO TAKE
PLACE. IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE RATHER THAN AT DIEGO PORTALES

COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH’ RIVAS HAS, ON OCCASION, nanoisn& 3)

 

 

SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE PEREZ ADMINISTRATION, SUCH AN

ASSIGNMENT AS DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT IS UNUSUAL. IT 1S OUT OF
CHARACTER FOR PEREZ TO EXPLAIN OR APOLOGIZE FOR HIS ACTIONS AND -
IT APPEARS STRANGE THAT A PEREZ REPRESENTATIVE, WOULD ADMIT THAT |

BOSCH HAS POWERFUL FRIENDS IN THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT WHEN THE

GOVERNMENT HAS GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ATTEMPT TO HIDE THIS FACT. )
