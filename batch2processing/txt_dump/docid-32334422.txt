It is to be noted that referenced communications
contained leads to interview RICHARD W, DAWSON and OTTO "DUKE"
KOLING at Fort Worth, Texas,

On 7/15/65, DL 269-PSI advised SA GARRY OWEN WATT
that he was quite certain any additional interviews with: indivi-
duals associated with instant group, at the present time,
would more than likely uncover him as an informant,  Infor-
mant advised that the interview of GRADY R. TURPIN by an
Agent of the FBI had not only left TURPIN shaken by the
experience but also suspicious of informant's activities. .
Informant stated that he felt certain that TURPIN had =
communicated hs suspicions to other members of the group,
and any additional interviews of members of the group would
seriously curtail his effectiveness,

 

Continued contacts will be maintained with DL 269 - Lak
and all other pertinent investigation will be conducted Pree.
in regard to the group, but it is not felt that any additional us
interviews at this time would be in the best interests of the
Bureau,
