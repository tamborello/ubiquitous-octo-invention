wag discussed with Mr. James Hunt, DC/CI on 27 March 1962, He was =
asked if the A.my had been advised of BEVISION's identification
of SLOBODA as a KGB ascent (YT-1192, 16 January 1962) and if this
information should be passed to JAGUAR, Mr. Hunt said that the ©

‘Army ‘was somewhat embarrassed ebout this case since SLOBODA had | :
"flunked 4 or 5 LCFLUTTER examinations" before his defection, so | |
the information had not been passed to the Army,” As noted in ms?»
SLOBODA was not particularly important, according to BEVISION, ‘

and Hunt believed the army assumed he was an RIS agent + when he |
went over the hill. :

SLOBODA's prior KGB involvement was confirmed by BEVISION,
as reported in YT-1192. See attached memorandum of 28 March 1962 in
regard to passage of this information to the Army. Further indications are
the facts that SLOBODA was a KGB resettlement case and that he later told
an American Embassy Moscow official that he had been blackjmailed and

’

and 851, 23 March 1962.
3. Army security investigations as immediate cause of defection.

Per USAREUR Case Summary. 2-62-2, DUTKANICZ. told American
Embassy Moscow officials that he had informed his KGB handler that he was
under investigation for security reasons. He defected soon after, in accord
with a KGB suggestion that he do so,

SLOBODA's defection was precipitated by increased Army
security measures, according to BEVISION.

1. DUTKANIC2's “Army assignment at time of defection. :

USAREUR Case Summary 2-62~2 (copy attached) confirms
DUTKANICZ's assignment to the 32nd Signal Battalion in Darmstadt.
However, his wife indicated that he had CIC connections, In an interview
at the American Embassy Moscow on 5 December 1961 (cited in DBA-288,

. 24 January 1962), she indicated that their trip behind the Iron Curtain “had

been made possible because her husband worked for the CIC and was. allowed
to do things the ordinary 'GI' could not do.". There are also penciled no-
tations in the 201 file suggesting that: his Army assignment may have included
intelligence functions of some kind, ;

2, -Previous KGB connection of both defectors.

Per USAREUR Case Summary 2- 62- 2, DUTKANICZ himself

- told American Embassy officials in Moscow that he had been approached by

KGB representatives.in a bar near Darmstadt in 1958 and had accepted
recruitment as a result of their threats and inducements. He. claimed to

have given them minimum cooperation from then until his defection, although
the Army considered it probable that he had done more than he admitted. A

‘further indication of his KGB involvement.before defection is the fact that the
special decree granting him Soviet citizenship was enacted three months before
his arrival in the USSR;. see, Emb tel 851.

controlling agency was the KGB. He admits having four meetings with
the KGB representatives, who were allegedly from Vienna, Austria, .
during the period 1958 to 1960. He was furnished an accommodations |
address which he no longer. remembers and was given secret writing _
materials. ‘He claims to have sent only four letters to the accommo~
‘dations address and he alleges to have furnished only negative
imminence reports, . :

 

In May 1960 Dutkanicz informed his’ SIS handler that he .was. being”
“investigated for security reasons and he was advised to apply for
‘leave and defect with his wife and family to the USSR via Austria and.
Czechoslovakia. Dutkanicz complied with the instructions. Contact .
with KGB representatives was established on 26 June 1960 in Bratislava,
Czechoslovakia, a short distance from Vienna. He and hia family then
drove to Lvov, USSR, with a Soviet escort. He was subsequently :
exploited by the Soviets for propaganda purposes. The actual propaganda
material was prepared by the KCB based on details furnished by 9: -. ..
Dutkanicz. In March 1962 the Suviets permitted his wife to return to
the United States, but the children were retained in the USSR. Dutkanicz
was allowed to accompany his wife to the US Embassy in Moscow for making
the necessary preparations for her return. During this period Dutkanicz
‘made a statement concerning his espionage activities in behalf of the
KGB. . . ;

 

USAREUR Comment '

Although Dutkanicz's confession waa ‘obtained under unuoual etreum-
:stances, his statements appear substantially true although obviously
incomplete. A strong possibility exists that he worked for the KGB for
a longer period than he admits, and it is probable that Dutkanicz pro- ©
vided the KGB with considerably more information than negative imminence
sveports. His statement that his SIS recruiters were from Vienna-is i
possibly correct and is supported by his alleged defection route. His
statement that he refused payment from the SIS seems unlikely, since he
reportedly was spending considerable amounts of money before his defection. _
The case is of unusual significance since it constitutes one of the moat
serious known penetrations of USAREUR forces by hostile intelligence.
“Also important is the fact that Dutkanicz's defoction was apparently .
instigated by the Sovicts for propaganda purposes after ho lost access |
‘to sensitive information.: . ;
