ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

 

1. The presence of so many new desk personnel at.
headquarters - people who are unfamiliar with station
history - means that we must turn to you with questions
oftener than you might wish. Our present question
concerns property involved in LIEMPTY, (We are submitting
the project as received from the field, but do not

'understand the background very well.)

2. HMMA-11257 of 16 January 1959, a project renewal, said
that "approximately..one year ago the LICALLA base was
purchased by KUBARK throughb LIMOUSINE", and we have not found

LICALLA, why does it cost us $1800 a year for rent and
utilities? (Up until the submission dated 1963 the project
renewal used to say “LIMITED. and LICALLA rents are returned

_ to station by LIMOUSINE and credited to station miscellaneous
receipts" but after that time this sentence was eliminated.)

(Continued. .)
