Red Eagle Club inasmuch as it was "dying." He agreed since his
wife was still in Califemrita and he had nothing better to do.
ROCCO found that the Red Eagle Club was not "dying" though - it
was already "dead." The club caters strictly to neighborhood
clientele and the neighborhood itself is decaying as a result

of the bad reputation which has built up over the years. The

anything. Nothing of which he could conceive would be worth
it and that-is one reason why he has stayed away from his

gambling contacts at Las Vegas. He has.tried the Las Vegas "life"

on occasion and has found himself losingg $35 a day while earning
about $20. He cannot afford, at thé age “ofr 48, to "go backwards"
anymore, financially or otherwise, -

The building business is a completely new line for him, having
been a chef, bartender and restaurant manager in the past, but
the income on his investment should be steady with the advent

of good weather. His partner, NUCCI, (phonetic) is an excellent
man who likes to work but knows nothing about money. He would

‘rather take chances in performing jobs for people whose loans

have not cleared. ROCCO refuses to do this.

Most of the work done by Dowe Bullders.is performed after
conventional loans have been secured from recognized lending
institutions like the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company. To
securd an FHA lodn is difficult, iif. not: impossible, inasntach as
FHA wants the first mortgage on work and all of the jobs Dowe
handles have existing mortgages and can offer only second
mortgages which are not acceptable by FHA. The work performed

is strictly improvement and modernization of existing construction.

Dowe Buildérs, carries no salesmen on its rolls at this ‘time but
pays for job#leads. ROCCO is out early each morning looking
for work for the company, sam acts as both supervisor and
middle man in a project. He hires "mechanics" to perform :
duties and pays them after they complete a job and the bank has
paid him,

‘ROCCO has been out of the federal genitentiary for approximately

three years and is enjoying his unusual freedom to the fullest.
He has two children by his first wife residing at Homer City,
Pa. He. divorced her years ago. His boy, age 20,.will be
discharged from the U. S. Navy during August, 1962. This boy
paid him a visit while on leave recently and announced his

intention to.work for his father as a salesman. He had not seen

his son for ten to twelve years but the boy .gaeems mature and
expects to be married soon,

ROCCO plans to give him a job as a salesman but will definitely
not support him. He cannot afford this as he has married an
Irish girl named GINNY since his release from the penitentiary.

GINNY has two children of her own - a boy 14 and a girl 13. She
is originally from Oklahoma and ROCCO brought her East as soon
as he obtained employment. GINNY and her two children are now
living in a residence on Wiltsie Street in Pittsburgh where

he is renting a house from PHIL GENOVESE at $125 a month. This
rent is much too high. ROCCO is looking for something much
cheaper inasmuch. as he cannot. seem to bring PHIL down on. the
rent. PHIL GENOVESE and his wife have secured a divorce and have
moved out of the premises. The exact address of the residence

is not known to ROCCO,

ROCCO does not pay much attention to any of his four children.
GINNY 's children are well-behaved and are the responsibility

of his wife. ‘Her son is finding it hard to adjust ‘in Page sburgh
bécause he does not make friends easily but her.daughter"i

Both attend high school, the name of which is unknown to ROCCO.

ROCCO arrived in Pittsburgh from California during December, 1961,
and came to this loeation voluntarily. No one sent for him and.
and no one expected*him to do a job when he got here. | He

drove to Pittsburgh in a 1961 cream-colored Mercury Heo0" bearing
California license TZV374 on which he still owes more than

twenty payments. He drives to work in this car daily and

parks it in front of Dowe.Builders when he can secure a parking

‘gpace in that location.’ He has not seen SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA

since he arrived but knows him... He has not seen many of his

ee Date __ 3/11/62

”

ARTHUR ANTHONY ROCCO, FBI No. 3 702 619,.was interviewed at

his place of business, 5830 Forward Avenue,in the Squirrel

Hill section of Pittsburgh, Pa, A”sign oyer the door of his
business office read, "Dowe Builders, Complete Home Modernization,
HAzel 1-2677." ROCCO furnished the following information

during conversation with him: ‘

He has been in this business for approximately five weeks, having
borrowed money from relatives to make the initial investment.

He owns fifty percent of the business and is office manager.

# .He also handles all of the finances relating to Dowe Builders.
The co-owner of the company is MARIO NUCCI (reer), an
individual approximately 29 years of age who has had the company
for eight or nine years.

ROCCO is no longer on probation and owes no time anywhere , He
is not bitter and actually committed all of the crimes for.which
he has been convicted in the past. He considers himself lucky
in many respects and has always:reakized that one must. pay Sf
for getting caught, As he stated it, “When you play: the violin,
there comes a time when you must dance." Following his recent inear-
ceration.in the Federal Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa., and
the Federal renitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, he was released
to relatives at Needles, California. He disliked the town
- immefsely but was forced to secure sponsors there inasmuch
as the only relatives he has, a mother and a brother, .reside
at Needles. He has had many business offers but everyorie
in the vicinity of Needles knew of his criminal background and
he did not feel that he would progress at all if he stayed
there. He dislikes California and realizes there is nothing
there for him, He enjoys living and working at Las Vegas,
‘Nevada, and has many contacts in that location. i CB
beg, however, so decided to. réturn to Pittsburgh to obtain
a start in a business of some sort, v

 

 

Ao

Many of the old friends of ROCCO do not recognize him. He has

been out of circulation, as far as Pittsburgh associates are

concerned, for approximately fourteen gears. Although he admits

to weighing 210 pounds ;,he weighs easily 225 to 230 pounds and has

lost a great deal of his h@ir. He has learned all of his Lessons

the hard way and realizes. fe, could not do another ten years for
