RE: JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA, EARL SCHEIB, ete,
}i =-“RSw

an international organizer for the Teamsters Union, Kavner was

reported to be a sick man who wants to leave the Teamsters Union
but Hoffa does not trust Kavner and will not let him go. Kavner
reportedly is in Mayo Clinic at. the present time and the source

t feels that Kavner may be “ripe” for intensified inquiry.

According to the informant Earl Scheib has been paying
Doria regularly during the life of a “sweetheart” contract. Scheib
reportedly spends every day at the race track’ and every night
getting drunk at the Del Monico Restaurant, 828 South Robertson
Boulevard, Los Angeles, which Scheib alse owns. Scheib allegedly
loses a Lot. of. money gambling and the informant believes that payoffs
to Doria may be covered in this. fashion,

 

 

The Bureau has:.opened a new case, captioned the same
as this airtel, with Los Angeles as origin and the field should do
likewise, A full and complete investigation concerning all of the
afore-mentioned items should be initiated immediately.

 

Los Angeles should immediately reinterview the informant
to obtain further specifics concerning. all of the above-mentioned
matters with particular emphasis-on ascertaining, if possible,
his sources and:any evidence’ that might -xexist which will establish
that these allegations are‘true,: The.additional information the
informant furnishes concerning this matter. should be incorporated
inte a letterhead memorandum suitable for dissemination to the
Criminal Division, which. should be forwarded: to the Bureau by cover.

OTHER 4

As stated above the investigation.in this case should be
complete and thorough in all respects.: The field should conduct
all. logical investigation to determine the veracity.of this
information. It is pointed out that through: imaginative and probative
investigation. it may be possible to develop: violations.of Section 186,
Title 29, U. 5, Code.on the-part: of Scheib, Doria and Hatfield,
or. possibly Hoffa, if it can be established that: he has shared in
any payoff made by Scheib ‘to’a union official,
