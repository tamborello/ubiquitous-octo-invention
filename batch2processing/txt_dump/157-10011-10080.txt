a. '1965-DD/P Chrono + DDCI''
- Helms! memorandum dated 7 December 1965 describing
telephone conversation between Helms and Sullivan re
FBI-CIA relations. In particular, the memorandum deals

with apparent FBI dissatisfaction over CIA activity in con-
nection with project BOURBON,

 

- Helms! memorandum for Bill Moyers dated 9 June 1965
enclosing a document describing the Agency's "efforts to
do something constructive in the student field on behalf of
United States foreign policy.'' The enclosure is a particu-
larly unusual document in which it is difficult to determine
whether Helms is using cryptonyms for the actual names.
If he was using cryptonyms, they were poorly chosen and,
if not, the document appears to describe domestic involve-
ment in the New York area at a time well in advance of the
Ober Project. Among the institutions, organizations and
individuals mentioned in the memorandum are Columbia
University, Adelphi College, the AFL-CIO, the John Birch
Society, and Senators Dodd and Towers.

h. "DCI (Helms) Chrono No. 2 1970!

 

“MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD!" dated 28 July 1970
the subject of which was ''Discussion with Attorney General
Mitchell on Domestic Intelligence''. Helms states that the
Attorney General had apparently heard nothing of President
Nixon's instructions with respect to domestic intelligence
until that morning. Helms adds that Mitchell also appeared
to have no knowledge of the 5 June 70 meeting with respect
to the Huston Plan which was chaired by the FBI.

j. “1971-DCI Chrono Helms’!

The only document in this file is a memorandum to
from Helms dated 29 October 1971, subject of which was

"Don A. Nixon'', The first sentence of the memorandum
states that "this is the monthly report on subject which you
requested’. The memorandum goes on to set forth certain

information with respect to the President's brother which
is attributed to a reliable source.

k. ''1972-DCI Chrono Helms'!

This file contains a memorandum from Helms to the Deputy
Director dated 28 June 1972, the subject of which was
“Watergate Affair". The memorandum purports to describe
the substance of a phone call from Acting Director Gray in
which Helms asked for and received Gray's commitment to

that Dahlberg was not a CIA agent. Helms also reports that

he requested that the Bureau confine itself to persons already
arrested or under suspicion, and that they desist from expanding
their inquiry into other areas that might eventually run afoul of
CIA operations.

3. Miscellaneous Files
a. "R, Helms - Memos for Record" (1951-64)
ER OE SCOT 1921-04)

- "Memorandum for Record" dated 24 June 1964, subject of
which was "Talk with Chief Justice Earl Warren". This
memorandum and several others in close proximity describe

; meetings between Helms and members and staff of the

& Warren Commission (including ''David Belin of Treasury")
with respect to the Commission's use of certain information
provided by the Russian defector Nosenko. The group looking
into possible CIA connections with the Kennedy assassination
may be interested in reading these documents although they
appear to me to raise no significant questions.

b. 'R. Helms ~ 1965 - Memos for Record (1965-1972)"
—:Helms - 1965 - Memos for Record (1965-1972)"

There appear to be no significant documents in this file but

it should be noted that while there are numerous memoranda
for the record in the earlier years, there is only one document
for 1972. In that document, during a meeting with Helms in
early 1972, John Ehrlichman expresses concern that Henry
Kissinger is copying classified documents apparently for use
in his writing when and if he returns to the academic life.
