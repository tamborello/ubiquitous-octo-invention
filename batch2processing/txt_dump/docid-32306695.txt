responsibility of DESIMONE to relay the instructions of the
"Commissione" to the "Bosses" of other Western "Brugads".

 

LICATA did not further identify such groups.

He did mention that DESIMONE had numerous expenses in connection
with these trips. He also mentioned that DESIMONE had to go
"out east” at least a half dozen times last year and after

such trips he had to relay instructions to certain other "Bosses".
Again, LICATA did not further identify such contacts except
to mention that DESIMONE had, among other contacts, relayed
some "Commissione" instructions to "the Boss in Texas",

on at least occasion last year. (This may possibly be
JOSEPH FRANCIS VELLO of the Dallas, Texas area, known

at least on occasion in the past, to have been in contact
with the Los Angeles "Brugad”.)

LICATA then told informant in strict confidence -
requesting informant not to discuss this with any other
"member" of the "Brugad" -- that DESIMONE had to be in
New York on 1/25/65, to attend a meeting of the "Commissione".

LICATA did not state that he knew the purpose of
this meeting, but speculated that it possibly would relate
tothe appointment of a new "Boss" for the JOE BONANNO
"Brugad" and, perhaps, re-recognition of this "Brugad"
by all the other "Brugads" in La Cosa Nostra. He did
indicate, however, that after this meeting, it would again
be necessary for DESIMONE to contact other "Bosses" to
relay "Commissione" instructions.

The San Diego Office advised on 1/20/65, that FRANK
DESIMONE's car was last observed at the residence of PETER
MONTANA, El Cajon, California, at 10:45 a.m., 1/17/65, by
a@ neighborhood source. ;

The San Diego Office advised on 1/21/65, that a
check of all reservations on flights from San Diego to New
York and Chicago through 1/25/65, were negative as to any
reservations for FRANK DESIMONE or for any reservations
where the home telephone of PETER MONTANA was furnished as a
call back number. Stops were placed with the airlines.

. LA 4448-c-TE advised on 1/22/65, that FRANK |
- DESIMONE had departed for his meeting in the east on 1/20/65.
