recalled that, LA ROCCA was completely -bankrupt at that time
because of numbers setbacks but managed to raise enough: money

to put up his share. MESSER said he personally’ traveled to.
Chicago to arrange for the purchase of machines to be distributed
by this company and had a verbal agreement with ART ROONEY ——

who allowed’ him to place these machines throughout. the East
Liberty, Homewood, and Garfield Sections of Pittsburgh. where

ROONEY was not operating. - According to MESSER, ROONEY,who is

the present owner of the Pittsburgn Steelers, professional

' football club, was the only man who could get paste reels

‘before LA ROCCA tried, and controlled the entire Pittsburgh |

vicinity in this regard, MESSER said. that the Government
placed a $100 tax stamp on each machine and the city of
Pittsburgh put a $50 tax stamp on each machine. He said ‘that
other owners of the company, in addition to himself and LA -
ROCCA, were FRANK AMATO, BARNEY MC GINLEY, SAMUEL. MANNARINO,
and F, W. Z0GG, the latter from. Chicago. :

MESSER advised that the company was doing well finangiatty

before” Allegheny County authorities raided @stablishments

where the machines had -been placed and forced is out of

‘business. ‘He ‘recalled that, although each: of the six afore--

mentioned individuals owned an équal share in the company ,
SAM MANNARINO and LA ROCCA seemed.to run everything and held >
meetings at which important subjects were discussed in Italian,

which. he did not.understand. He advised that he realized

that LA ROCCA was only. using him for his proven protection
methods and MESSER did not mind as long as he got! his cut

of the profits... He recalled that during 1946.or 1947, MEIKE
GENOVESE came on the scene.: He stated that: this individual

had been a pickup: man for LA ROCCA in the East Liberty-Homewood ;

. Section of Pittsburgh and was a tough kid’ who, according °

to MESSER, "was almost begging to go to. jail." He said
LA ROCCA. turned GENOVESE: over to him and asked MESSER to "keep .

‘him clean" because he had- him in mind for future plans.

C

He :recalled that FRANK. VALENTI, who. was present at the
Apalachin tonference of. hood lunis , and ANTONIO RIPEPI, a
Pittsburgh hoodlum, visited the offices:of the.coin Machine -

“Distributing Company . regularly and always took, orders from

leading. up. to his current position and activities. in
racketeering matters, can be obtained from information relating :
to the early, activities of LA ROCCA, furnished to the Pittsburgh ‘
office of the. FBI as follows: :

On February 27. 1958, GEORGE NESSER advised’ that he- had been
~in the numbers writing. activity since.about 1928 and is still
active in this regard. He said that most of. Pittsburgh's
-  . present day "big racket men" once depended on him solely for
, protection purposes since he knew local and state police
: figures’ and recalled that JOHN LA ROCCA was. one of these
racketeers. MESSER stated that LA ROCCA became.acquainted. |
with him in about 1941 or 1942 when LA ROCCA was handling all
the numbers activity in the East Liberty Section, of Pittsburgh
and had set himself up as a "little god." When LA ROCCA’
became dissatisfied with his financial gains, he left- Pittsburgh
on a trip to Chicago to see friends about paste reel machines
with which he felt he could make more money. MESSER said
a paste reel was similar to-a "éne-armed bandit" with the.
exception that a small paper-wrapped mint was dispensed after
. the coin was placed in the slot and the play was registered.
The Chicago manufacturer of this machine circumvented ‘the .
"strictly for gambling purposes" phraseology in the law in
this. manner. : ; .
While LA ROCCA was in Chicago, MESSER said he moved into ;
the East. Liberty Section. and took’ over the entire numbers |
operation. . He. turned in his numbers returns. to one, GEORGE
CHRISTY (now deceased) in Pittsburgh. When LA ROCCA’ returned
to- Pittsburgh he became angry with MESSER and his move
and had-someone drive a car over MESSER one night as he.
was crossing a street. MESSER said when he was. , discharged
from the hospital he found out that his automobile had numerous »
bullet holes in it. MESSER said that-.because he thought.
he would make money in the East Liberty Section, he stayed :
in the business of writing numbers and actually. forced LA ROCCA
* out of the numbers business. ;

MESSER advised that in. about: 1943, he and: LA ROCCA became |
. - friendly and LA ROCCA invited him to share equally in the _.
J ownership ofthe Coin Machine Distributing Company which later
set up offices at 5746 Baum Boulevard, in Pittsburgh. MESSER
