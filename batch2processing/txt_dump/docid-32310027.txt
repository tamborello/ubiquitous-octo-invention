-when EDDIE FISHER opened at the Eden Rock Hotel on Miami Beach
and FISHER made a big fuss over the subject and sat at his
_ table. He stated that DEAN MARTIN also acted the same way
- when GIANCANA caught his act last season at Miami Beach. He
stated that SINATRA also seemed to’ afford GIANCANA differential
treatment at the time he saw them together at Palm Springs.
PCI stated. he was sorry if he had been misunderstood when
previously interviewed.

 

It could not be determined if PCI was denying being
with GIANCANA in Las Vegas because of fear of having to testify
‘to this at some later date or had actually conveyed the wrong
impression innocently when first questioned. . PCI stated he
has not been in Las Vegas since June, 1962. YU

If New York or Las Vegas has any information contrary.
to this, kindly advise Miami-so PCI's reliability can be
evaluated. J :

: PCI advised that he has never heard of subject
owning any property in the Florida. He advised that he and
subject and PHYLLIS and CHRIS MC GUIRE once visited a house
just below Palm Beach, Fla., during one of GIANCANA's visits
to Fort Lauderdale, wi GIANCANA advised that a friend of
‘his had for sale. an ee the house seemed to be worth
about $30,000 but was on. an excellent waterfront lot. This
house is apparently the one owned by LES KRUSE, an associate

- of GIANCANA, and its location has long been known to the :
Miami Office.) ;
