At Harrisburg, Pa.

The Intelligence Unit of the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice at Pittsburgh, Pa., is conducting an intensive investi-
gation relating to expenditures made by LA ROCCA during. the
years 1961-1962, and desires to learn of any motor vehicle
purchases made by LA ROCCA during these years. It has been
noted that most of the cars driven by LA ROCCA are registered
under. the name of his wife, MARY S. LA ROCCA, or the North

‘Star Cement Block Company at Pittsburgh, Pa. A Thunderbird

driven by his adopted son may be registered in the name JOHN
S.. LA ROCCA, i

Philadelphia at Harrisburg is requested to advise
whether a séarch under the name of the subject and all known
aliases, as well as for his adopted son, his wife and. the
North Star Cement Block Company for 1961-1962, would be
feasible so that the Intelligence Unit of the Internal Revenue
Service may be advised. It should be noted that prosecution
against LA ROCCA is being sought for the early portion of
the year, 1964.

At Wayne, Pa.

Will ascertain the subscriber to telephone Mu 8-

mar, Pa., on 5/12/63. If this number belongs to a motel,
will determine whether LA ROCCA or his adopted son made re-
servations during the appropriate period.
