(Summary of evaluation of past performance /if applicable7 with emphasis

DATES LOCATION AGENCY TASK

GERENDE was: recruited in March 1955, just prior to his graduation from
the Mexico City College. He was trained as a member of a surveillance
team, and was also used as an investigator to collect operational data
on persons and organizations of interest to the Station. He quickly
demonstrated a capacity for leadership and at one time was leader of
the tean.

He was also used as a basehouse keeper in an audio operation and
Processor of tapes. He exadled in this type of work because of his bi-~
lingual Spanish/English facility, and, more importantly, due to his diy er-
sified experience in clandestine operations which permited him to spot
operational leads,

Since 1958 his primary use has been as main cutout/principal agent
to a group of photographic basehouses targeted against the Soviet Embassy,
and one mobile photographic truck. He processes the raw photographic t ake
and services the majority of the accomodation addresses used by the
Station. He has contributed significantly to the AMROD operation

He performs all his tasks in a professional manner. He is well suited

to intelligence work, and plans to make KUBARK his career, The Station
depends heavily on him because of his knowledge of Mexico, and his mobility
as a Mexican. He works full time for KUBARK; cover company requires very
little time.

rh cone erry
In case of "New Hire" give e personality assessment in terms of
capability, attitude, and projected suitability; state names of
Division personnel who have interviewed him; give account of his
performance in current non-Agency job.
