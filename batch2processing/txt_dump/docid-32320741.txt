Howard:

- The attached letter to the Director, (Hartingh’s opened

. copy attached), delivered yesterday from the JFK Review Board,
advises of determinations to disclose reco.:ds. A seven-day
period for appeal to the President exists, per this letter. The
details of the documents at issue have been set forth in John A.
Hartingh to William E. Baugh, Jr., memorandum dated 9/6/95, which
recommended against appeal but that CID and NSD advise you if
they recommend appeal.

The Task Force has been advised that CID deferred to
NSD because the records at issue relate to their work and that
NSD recommends against appeal.

The only difference between Hartingh’s memo and the
attached letter is that the Board did not address document #6 in
Hartingh’s memo as the Board has apparently tabled that document
instead of ordering it released. With this change, CIA advises
they do not plan to appeal the release of their information in
FBI documents, but they will advise the FBI by formal letter

within the timeframe for appeal.

Please advise mé ASALS tet fo id we may assist you

further in this matter.
