Membership Ceremony ;

Source stated that when a member is brought into the orpganiza~
tion, his index finger is pricked and allowed to bleed
freely and that, in turn, is matched with a cut or bleeding
wrist of a member in the organization. In this way, they i
become blood brothers. The member, by using his wrist, is .
part of the "srowing tree." The finger has symbolism, in
that, like a scion, it is grafted to the growing tree, It
becomes part of it and is one. During this ceremony, a

- holy card consisting of a small picture of a sairit is
burned and a pledge of allegiance to the organization is
made by the neophyte, putting the organization before him- r
self, his family and his religion. The neophyte is then
kissed on both cheeks by the members,

Corroboration of Information

The above information was subsequently corroborated in
interviews with SF-2550-C-TE.

SF-2354-C denies he is presently a member of the organiza-
tion. His statements of his non-membership are voluntary,

as he apparently prefers not to be identified as a member.
However, the information obtained from him, his acquaintance-
ship with the above-mentioned people and his knowledge of

their activities would indicate that he is, as described

by SF-2550-C-TE, a member of captioned organization. -
