Memorandum to Mr. T..W. Leavitt

Re: Lee Harvey Oswald avis
. CONFIGERTIAL

. , In the above instance, Legat, Mexico city would not
have been able,to respond .to the American Ambassador ina
timely manner Jgitnout the aid of CIA. Fortunate for the
Legat, CIA. pladed enough importance on the release to have
it flown to Mexico by courier.. In this instance, the
Legat's office was in real jeopardy. (The Government of
Mexico will cooperate as long as the Gooperation is not
made a matter of public record. The Mexican Government is
very nationalistic, and makes every ,effort in’public to
appear free of U. S. influence )(u

Legat, Mexico ity has now alerted us.of a teletype
which was 1/15/78 A#Erom CIA Headquarters [co their Chief
of Station concerning release “under the (<2

‘FOIA of documents in captioned matter. Legat, Mexico Cit
expressed his concern over the adverse publicity likely- to
result and the impact on our relations with Mexico. He

\ again cited the need to advise in advance the U. S. Ambassador
in Mexico City and the Legat's contacts there, which is "WO f
f
’

 

difficult by the insufficient lead time granted in this /
mattersy By teletype to all SACs and Legats dated 1/16/78
notification was made that the above material was to be

released 1/18/78. ;

The two above-cited instances point out the necessity
of prior notification and the dire consequences of failure
to notify the host government and the American Embassy Concerned.
- Failure to properly inform the American Ambassador in advance
places our. Legat in.a most embarrassing position which could
possibly be avoided. Failure to promptly provide similar in-
formation to the Legal Attache could easily jeoparize our
entire Legal Attache operation, taking into account (
u)

sensitivities of thé host country government.

RECOMMENDATION:

Focharentinien sae ai aaa a

\W@Oin t in order to avoid placing our foreign operations
in jebpardy,} future releases effecting our Legats be coordinated
in advance with the Intelligence Division.
