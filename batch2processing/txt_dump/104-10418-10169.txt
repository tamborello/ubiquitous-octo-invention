Dear Phil:

Re: Angleton v. Turner
Civil Action No. 78-865-A

I am writing you regarding our telephone conversation
of 19 March 1979 and Mr. Angleton's acceptance of our
pending settlement offer in the above-captioned litigation.
The offer outstanding is for your client,.James J. Angleton,
to be allowed access to the records mentioned in our 9 March
1979 letter to you, viz:.

ad. the contract by which Mr. John Hart was
employed for the purpose of representing the Central
Intelligence Agency in testimony before the House
Assassinations Committee (This document has previously
been released to Mr. Angleton with some deletions in.
response to his FOIA request. Under the terms of this
offer, Mr. Angleton would be permitted to see the
unredacted version.);.

2. the document by which Mr. Hart was authorized
to review agency files in preparation for the Committee
testimony (A further review of the files has resulted
in the discovery of documents which may have some
bearing on this portion of the request. These will
be made available to Mr. Angleton pursuant to the
terms enumerated in CIA's 9 March 1979 letter to you.);

3. the document setting forth the guidelines
under which Mr. Hart's testimony was given (Like the
. dgcument requested per subparagraph 1 above, this
document has been previously released to Mr. Angleton.
Under the terms of our settlement offer, Mr. Angleton
would, likewise, be permitted to view the unexcised
version.); . . :

 
13-00000

   

    

4. the incoming telegram from Geneva describing
the first contact and meeting with Mr. Nosenko ane tin
“long telegram" which Mr. Angleton sent to Geneva in
reply;

5. the document which supports Mr. Nart's alle-
gation that Mr. Angleton visited the installation in
Northern Virginia at which Mr. Nosenko was detained
(Please note that there is no mention of Northern
Virginia in Mr. Hart's testimony. See, p. 250, line
4626. The document indicates that the visit by
Mr. Angleton was to a facility outside ‘Northern
Virginia.);

6. any document(s) that reflect that Mr. Angleton
or any member of the Counterintelligence Staff partici-
pated in any conference, discussion or meeting relating

. to the alleged hostile interrogation of. Mr. Nosenko;
and : :

7. the memorandum referred to by Mr. Hart (See,
._p. 165 of Hart's Committee Testimony) regarding a
conversation: between Mr. Angleton and the Chief of
the Soviet. Division.

In addition to the above materials, Mr. Angleton will

‘also be allowed access to item No. 10 requested from CIA in

your 11 December 1978 — letter to the Freedom of Information

‘Coordinator, i.e.:

the tape or transcript of the interview mentioned
in Mr. Hart's testimony in which Mr. Angleton is
alleged to have referred to Mr. Bagley' s having
"caught a big fish" (Nosenko).

Access will be granted to Mr. Angleton on the same:
basis as mentioned in our 9 March 1979 letter to you. ;
Should Mr. Angleton wish to disclose portions of the con-
tents of these documents to members or staffers of the
Select Committee on Assassinations of ‘the U.S. House of
Representatives, he should apply for such authority to the
Agency via the undersigned.

Acceptance of this offer will terminate our controvers
as to ail the CIA records requested by your client under the
FOIA and allow us. to. stipulate a dismissal of the pending .
litigation. .

This afternoon I talked with Chris Winkle re David Martin's request for
documents related to the Angleton case.

His comments were as follows:

Martin obviously got his act together from the Stipulation of Dismissal
document on file with the U.S, District Court in Alexandria. (The copy of the
Stipulation of Dismissal we had on file in gur Litigation folder did not include
the'Exhibit A' referred to in paragraph one of the Stipulation. ) . "Exhibit Al"
was the 20 March 1979 letter to Angleton's lawyer, Chabot, from “Ernest
Mayerfeld, outlining the specific items in the litigation that Angleton would
"be allowed access to". Cure had @ capy of te but no indication “Hh was “Exhibit A *)

Don't answer his initial request any sooner than necessary, When we
do, deny release offthé"information, maintiining it is still classified and

‘involves protection of sources and methods, (b)({1)(b)(3) of FOIA,
If he appeals we will-worry about it later.

But there's no denying: that Martin knows of the existence of the ‘specific
documents, — . : . .

Ot (Chris said that is sending out an interim response from :
APS.) co, en ; .

is to deny these documents to Martin even though some of them were . .
_. previously prepared for release in sanitize form to Angleton in litigation.
We acknowledged that if it had not. been for OGC's release of three documents
to Angleton without coordination with the DO we would have "Glomarized" :
Angleton's request. A "Glomar" response is also not possible to Martin for
the same reasons piusxthex but also beaause exhibit Aon file in U.S. —
Distric Court in Alexandra and that exhibit lists the documents that Martin

- ‘is requesting, The proposal now is to list and deny the documents to.
