Assistant Attorney General

NOTE: On 6/10/76, San Francisco requested emergency ‘authority for use
on 6/10/76 in this matter. After conferring with Robert F. Peterson,
Legal Counsel Division, San Francisco was denied authority to use the
consensual monitoring without Departmental approval on an emergency
basis. Mr, Peterson, after reviewing pertinent Department of Justice
instructions in regard to the granting of emergency authority, stated the -
facts presented by San Francisco did not warrant the granting of
emergency authority.

 

San Francisco is requesting approval for consensual monitoring
in the confidential source's apartment.
San Francisco will be advised if this request is approved that they are not to
monitor listening or recording devices that would overhear or record any

‘intimacies that would conceivably arise between Amarena, Fratianno, or
others and the confidential source,
