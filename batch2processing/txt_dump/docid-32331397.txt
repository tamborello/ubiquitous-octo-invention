On 5/1/63, WF 1108-C advised SA BUCKIEY that the
dice geme montioned above was located at 19th and Biltmore
Streets, N.W., Washington, D.€., im a large residence and thet
WESLINE, although ho had an interest in the operation, was
not participating in the game as yet. Informant stated that
SOURINE,, METCRELL end ROHANNA were running the game but that
the action was small due to a lack of players.

On 5/1/63, WF 1469-C advised SA EDWARD N,. VILIS
that ke kad heard that there was a large dice game recently
started at 1915 Biltmore Street, N.W, On 5/3/63, informant
advised SA WILLIS that ho had beon to 1915 Biltmore Street, N.YW.,
the previous evening (5/2/63) and that ROHANNA and TOURINE
Were present. RORENNA imdicated that there was not to be a
Gice game on that evening because of a lack of playing customers.
Enforment advised that CHARLIE WHITE (TOURINE) appeared to be
in charge of the establishment and that om at least one ccensicn
ROHANNA veferred to TOURING as “boos”, Informant advised that
the following individuals were present at the establishment:
JOSEPH GORDON, aka BROOKLYN; ERIC EDMONSTON, aka TOM MIX; and
two or three other individuals that he only knew by first name,
"LARRY", "BILL and "SMITYY"”.

UF 1469-C deseribed the residence at 1915 Biltmore
Street as a large three story structure which was in the
process of renovation of the interior. He said that there were
expensive furnishings and a gold wall-to-wall carpet on the
main floor. Informant was told by ROHANNA that the dice game
would be held om the second fleor of the building. Informant
said that in addition to the entrance door there was an
additional door which appeared to be new lecated eight or ten
feet inside the entrance. It was necessary for the doorman
te unleck the second deor with a key.

on 5/7/63,L____ | PCE, advised SA CARLTON OTHER 4
GIOVANNETTI that he had been to 1915 Biltmore Street, N.W.,
on the night of Saturday, 5/4/63, and that there was a fairly
large dice game held that night. BCI said that the dice game
was held in s large room on the second floor and that the
following individuals participated: TOURING; MITCHELL;
ELMONSTON, JIMMY LUBIN and others whom he could not identify.

On 5/6/63, Deputy Chief ROY EB, BLICK, Metropolitan
Police Department (HPD), advised SA ROBERT L. SHACKELFORD
that he had received information that there was a gambling
operation located at 1915 Biltemore Street, N.W. According
to Chief BLICK he sent two Morals Division personnel (not
named) to the e#tablishment Saturday evening, 5/4/63, at
approximately 10:45 p.m. Chief BLICK advised that the
establishment was a large three story structure and that the
interior wag lavishly furnished. According to Chief BLICK
there was no gambling activity during the period that the
MPD representatives were there and he advised that JOSEPH
GORDON and "BILIN" MITCHELL were the only ones present.

in connection with information furnished by Chief
e BLICK it is likely that the HPD officers wore at 1915 Biltmore “
Strest prior to the time PCE [[___]participated in the dice
n game the same night.

In view of the above developments it appears that
the dice game at Ripley, Maryland, has been abandoned for
the present. Inasmuch es the operation at 1915 Biltmore
Street involves substantially the same individuals as were
involved in the Pipley, Maryland, operation, it 1s likely
that thé Site for the game has been moved. Accordingly it
is) recommended that the office of origin be changed from
Baltimore to WFO since it appears that the operation hae been

- noved £Fom Ripley, Maryland, to ne District of Columbia.
