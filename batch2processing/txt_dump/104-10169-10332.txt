vy PORE GOCAP/LOLAFRCYE = heoting of Harry alfons ©3.000iK_
. (c. 19 Sept. 1930 in Helsinki) and Anatoliy Nixhaylo-
: P . 2 ans an’

P5012, 2 April 1961

1. Transmitted nerewith are the following:

A. A fiveepage revort of XOCDIMSs interrogation of Harry Alfons : f
SUNDVIK on 25 april 1961 3

B, A two-page memorandum from SXDVIK covering ;<cints ne had forgotten
during the interrozation :

 

2. When reading the attacned interrogation report, there are a nunber
of points to be noted. First of all, x K's first story wis a lie and it
was only when he wis pressed ty ROODINS tuat he sade any ua:tion of his mectings
with KLINOV. Therefore, tnis story could be only the ascund line of defense”
and not a true stury of their relationship, Second, th+ story does not atreapt
to explain why, when SuiwV1K had a weex off from work (fra 3.lurday, 8 April
to Sunday, 16 Appil), he only spent the four -iddle days cn iis trip instead
of utilizing the rest of his time. Third, wy oLInOV persisted until the last
moment and gade arrangements to see SUNUVIK again socially in dalsinkd if tie
had really "lost his grip" to SUNDVIX's superior arguuents and hostile attitude
ae SUNDVIK states, aAnywy, to say the least, we are not reucy to accept SUNDVIK's
story as it stands. “oe .as been asked to write out in detail, at least five ”
single-space typewritten paces, the history of nis contacta with KLIMOV. We
will check this paper against the report in hand, for a starter,

   

3. VALINK/6 is being kept informed of the detaila of this case. He
agrees with ROODINS that there is a good daal more than has been reveuled so
far. (By the way, we might mention that this is another casa in which VaLItK/6
and the help of the VALINK organization have teen invaluable. ‘They nave provided
full background reports on all concerned, and nave been surveilling SUNDVIK
off and on ever sincs we expressed our interest in him.)
— . &. Ag far as KLINOV's statements about COSTILLE ad ROCDINE gok this
i was only to be exy..vted and does not surprise either of tt For the history
* “Of COSTILLE's previous encounters with KLINV, see forHALya, 20 Harch 1961.
ROODINE MEEKXEZ has never met KLINOV. 25

 

5. The Ambissador, the Counselor, the Sscurity Officer and the Gemaral
Services Officer (SUNDVIK's imnediate boss) are aware of this case. The inter.
rogation took place .in the Security Ufficer's office, Gnly sOODINE ard 3UDVIK

were present, but FURSTUSS was in tiie adjoining office listoning through the
wall,

 

6 We still have not figured out exactly iow to handle this case. SUNDVIK
will eventually ta dismissed, but we would like to yet aang more infermtion
before we let go of tun. anyway, since fe las naun workia, at che enbassy
eince 1949 there is net wucn to be guined by threwing him out tomorrow, ‘ie
has vo).untesred tiat he will be seving ALINOV In tho next rew dnys to collett

to hear the wtory of the mesting., 12 da rosaible that we mit ask for assistance
