MEMORANDUM FOR THE SPECIAL GROUP (AUGMENTED)
From: Brig. Gen- LansdaleS(L
Subject: Policy Questions, Operation Mongoose
As Operation Mongoose goes into the approved activities of Phase I,
a number of policy questions have started to arise. Current problems,

needing resolution, are listed below. It is requested that the Special
Group (Augmented) provide guidance, as a matter of some urgency.

  
 

/ Use of U.S. military installations. CIA desires to train small
gro uban nationals on the U.S. Air Force Bombing Range, Avon
Park, Florida, immediately. Defense reports that the proposed area

is adequate for this training, but that such training of covert agents

who will be introduced ultimately into Cuba represents a security problem

 
   
 
 
 
  
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

os) and a departure from ‘past security procedures, due to the fact that U.S.
\y Government sponsorship will be apparent to trainees. Capture and
° interrogation of any of these covert agents could result in exposure
238 (in international news media) of U.S. official involvement in efforts to
ofa unseat the present Communist Cuban regime. A policy determination
s 58S is needed as to whether or not agents to be inkykipe ted into Cuba should
8258 be trained on U.S. Government installations ;
22ge To
8SeR There are other U.S. military ins tallations and properties, in
Ses the Southeastern U.S. and Caribbean areas, which CIA would like to use
B8E8 for similar training and operational purposes in the future. The same
28 2g NS policy determination could cover all uses of identifiable U.S. Government
ES23 e properties for training and deployment of Cuban nationals for covert
B28a6 5 - infiltration into Cuba.
7 28 é > 2. Arming of Cuban uerrillas. CIA needs a policy determination on
a wee the supplying of arms and equipment to deserving Cuban guerrillas, as
. 59,0? they are located, assessed, and request help. Such requests are starting

“logical that the number of requests will increase as the operation
; proceeds. There is a need for clearly defining the limits of arming
guerrillas (for self-defense, for training, for purposes short of
open actions in revolt), to permit operational judgment to be used
by designated operations officers, in Phase I.

   
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
   
 
   
 
 

3, Use of U.S. military personnel and equipment. CIA has
wequested Defense assistance in air and sea capabilities, including
supplying equipment and supplying U.S. military crews to operate
the equipment. Included in these requests are 2 LSD's (or similar
ships) to lie off the coast in support of CIA maritime operations, with
U.S. Navy crews of 200-300 depending upon the missions, 3 USAF
cargo aircraft with 'sheep-dipped" USAF crews for air re-supply,

2 amphibious aircraft with "“sheep-dipped'! USAF crews, and 2 sub-
marines for black broadcast operations. (This is in addition to CIA
requests for 6 PT type boats, 3 Helio aircraft, 2 82-foot Coast
Guard cutters, and arms, communications equipment, etc.), Again,B
mm. where U.S. military personnel and equipment are involved in Phase i
I} there is need for a policy determination which will permit operation
| judgment to be used by designated gherations officers, as well as aie
need for rules of engagement. "J ib ; ;
