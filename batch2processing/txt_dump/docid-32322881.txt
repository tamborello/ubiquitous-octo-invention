J. WOWAN GORKOM, President, and WILLIAM 3.) BROWDER,
General Counsel, Union Tank Car Company, 111 West Jackson,
“Chiéago; Illinois, advised on October 1, 1963, PAULINO SIERRA
was employed by that company's Legal Department when he
arrived in Chicago as part of a group of Cuban exiles being
resettled in the Chicago area. He gained confidence of the
company, because of his excellent work in both foreign and
domestic legal assignments, and his apparently sincere desire
to free Cuba from communist domination. Company officials
encouraged SIERRA in all efforts to unite Cuban exile
groups, by continuing to pay his salary, although not now
engaged in company business, even though the compaiyy has no
past or future interest im Cubaiand the company is not acting
for any business or government interests.

 

In early June of 1963, SIERRA brought FELIPE RIVERO
DIAZ, CARLOS RODRIGUEZ QUESADA, Dr. MANUEL LOZANO PINO,
ALBERTO GARRIDO, JUAN MEDINA VEGA and GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ,
described as Cuban exile leaders, to Chicago, showed them
through the well-appointed company offices, and introduced
them to company officials. The company denied it entertained
the group, or assisted with their expenses, but admitted it
has provided SIERRA with a letter of introduction to the
Government of Colombia. :
