SUBJECT: Response to HSCA Request of 25 July 1978

1. A thorough review of Agency files containing
production from the LILYRIC photographic surveil-
lance operation in Mexico City reveals the exis-
tance of no LILYRIC logs or production earlier
than 3 April 1967. It appears that earlier

‘photographs may have been destroyed in a purge of

Mexico City Station files and that the folders
for the destroyed material were re-used to for-
ward more recent photographic material to Head-
quarters for retention.

2. According to a blind memorandum dated 2 May
1977, subject: (Review of Mexico City Station
Files at the (pay econ Center, the LILYRIC
folder which wou ave contained photographs and
logs for the period 23 July through 30 November
1963 had been re-used to store LICALLA photographs
and logs for the period 2 May through 30 June 1967.
{Cf. Blind memorandum dated 5 May 1977, subject:
Photograph Records of the "Unidentified Man" Who
Was in Mexico City during October 1963.]

3. The above information is contained in a soft
file entitled: Photograph of Unidentified Indivi-
dual in Mexico City. This folder has been reviewed
by the following HSCA staff members:
