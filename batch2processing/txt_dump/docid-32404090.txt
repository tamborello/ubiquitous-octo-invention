Memorandum For: T. Jeremy Gunn
Executive Director
Assassination Records Review Board

. From: . J. Barry Harrelson

Senior Reviewer
JFK Project

Subject: | CIA-IR-21, Monthly Operational Reports
For the DRE

1. Reference is made to your request for subject
information as further refined in your 18 December 1997
letter to Chief, Historical Review Group. Specifically, you
asked about missing DRE monthly operational reports and the
identity of “Howard,” the name to which: the DRE appears to
have sent correspondence.

2. The Agency has searched appropriate data bases and
files for the “missing” reports. In addition, the
responsible offices have researched the questions contained
within your request. Based on these rather extensive
efforts, we can advise you as follows.

3. Missing operational monthly reports. The searches
conducted by the Agency failed to locate any of the reports

 

that appear to be “missing” -- December 1962 through April
1964, in general, and those for August and November 1963 in
particular. It should be noted that during the period in:

question, major policy differences between the Agency and
DRE developed. This was particularly true of the latter
years of association because the DRE would not take
directions or instructions about a number of operational
matters, insisting on engaging in activities the Agency did

“not sanction. These differences caused the Agency to reduce

the level of funding for the DRE. It also replaced the
officer designated to deal with the DRE. Then, about the
same time, the monthly operational reports trailed off. It
seems probable these events are linked and that reporting in
the form of such monthly reports simply stopped. The DRE
files we did find are also within the sequestered JFK
collection and they have previously been made available to
ARRB staff member Manuel Legaspi.

4. The identity of “Howard.” With reference to your

 

request for information on “Howard,” we, like you, have no

clear understanding about the use of this particular name on

DRE messages. The phrase, “To Howard” was used as the
addressee of several DRE prepared memoranda. We first
attempted to identify if, in fact, “Howard” was an actual
person. The name was not found to be a pseudonym. It also
was not found to be a registered alias. It also is not the
true name of any case officer associated with the DRE
operation at the time the DRE documents were written.
Following review of those data bases, knowledgeable case
officers were queried suggested that the use of “To Howard”
might have been nothing more than a routing indicator to
ensure .that the documents got to the correct CIA
office/officer or that the sender was someéné known to the
recipient.

5. If you have any further questions in this regard,
please advise.
