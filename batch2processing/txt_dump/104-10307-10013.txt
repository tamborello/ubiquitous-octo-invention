SUBJECT: Minute of Special Group (5412) Meeting

Held 20 June 1963
Subject item of interest to you is set forth below.

2. Sabotage Program, Cuba

In connection with the new Cuba sabotage program approved
yesterday, Mr. McCone suggested that CIA make a report to the
Special Group every two weeks. The Group agreed with this
procedure. They felt that such a report need not be in
written form nor very elaborate, and that it should consist
of a briefing on activities during the preceding period and
those planned for the next one. Mr. Bundy commented that
keeping the Group informed in this way constitutes protection
to the operators, since all agencies concerned are thereby
given a continuing feeling of just what is going on.
