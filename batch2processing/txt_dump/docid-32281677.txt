these groups. to carry out hostile action te limited, however,
becatse their main forces are not. located in Brasilia.
Brasilia is populated primarily by Bradilien government em-
ployees and their families who are whlikely to form the

group activities against the visit. Lerge
ations would ‘probably require the transporta-
tion. of danonstraters into Brasiiie from outlying areas.

This is largely true in every case except for students at the
National University of Brasilia and pesibly cone fmall Labor
