10 A I will tell you why that is pretty easy to figure.

11 The Agency wasn't running what I would call hard missions until
12 || late in 1959. You know Castro came in at the beginning of 1959.

15 || produced really professionals in terms of pilots or drop teams
16 || or saboteurs or what have until after they had had quite a bit

17 of training. At the other end of the calendar, General Eisenhow

  

18 had made it very clear to all of us who were operating over-

19 || flights that nothing was to be done. A little later in 1969

20 || when he was supposed to meet at the summit with Khruschchev

21 || and other world leaders, we haulted every overflight. And to

22 this day I can't understand why the U-2 went out. But all the

Paris was scheduled for May 1, I doubt if we flew anything
after March 15, or even maybe March 1, because there would
be no interference with it. So I can put it between those
dates without any trouble.
Q You said at times it. was a matter of concern to make
sure that the operations you had requested to support, or at
least the type of operation, had been approved by the National
Security Council, or whoever elsé was required. Did you recall
when you made any such inquiries in this case?

A, ‘The way we would work that is, having briefed, you

might ‘sav, tHe Air Force chain of command, if I was not told

 

to stop, it was gone. Again, it was a matter of wor! with
people that I had been with for years. It wasn't one hind.
They knew me, they knew the program. And if I fad then

 

and there was nothing to interfere within a day or two, we
would go. Now, sometimes they would want additional briefings.
But I don't remember one in this case.

0. I believe at some point one of the news coverages
had the name of one of the Cubans involved.

A. I don't put much story in that. I looked up some
notes that I thought might be pertinent, but I don't -~ we

A Originally it was one of a number of nissions that wae
were operating over a period of time. But it was one of tne
few that we operated with L-22's. The people who came over

from the Air Division stated that they had a place to land the

plane in Cuba on a road, on a small road, and they had a photo-

graph of it. And they were going to let two men out there and

then fly the plane back with a pilot and copilot to Eglin Air

was a normal procedure. And the object of their mission in
Cuba was to go to a building in Havana where one of the men
knew his way around and was pretty sure that he coula get into,
and if possible, he would shoot Castro.

Q Did you recall who told you this?

A. No, I don't, because we were working every cay with
these people. And I think if you had a listing of the Air
Division staff at chat date I probably could tell you it was one
of four men, something like that, a Division of maybe 39 men,
it would have been one of ‘three or four, or two of three’ or four}
The thing was, we were doing these things every day, it was not

an odd thing that came up, it was something that we were doing

en Tt surprises me that the CIA would describe the

mission to you in this much detail, -it doesn't seem consistent

with compartmentation and need-to-know particularly in view of

the sensitive nature of the mission.

A. That is.an awfully good point you are making. In
those days it did, because the more urgent part of my job was
to brief my boss, the Chief of Staff, Air. Force, and through

him the Secretary, Air Force, or the Secretary of Defense,

or whoever, as required.
