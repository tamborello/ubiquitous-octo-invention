2 Memo for Mr. Sullivan
Re: LEE HARVEY OSWALD
4105-82555

\
. There is no indication thet Lee Harvey Oswald was ever

recruited or trained by Department 13. During interview in- 1962

The claimed that he worked in a sadio factory in Minsk while he was
in Russia. His. diary and correspondence to his mother and brother
while he was in Russia plus the interviews of his widow confirmed
this. It is considered very uniikely that Oswald would have heen
recruited by Department 13 becaitse of his: suicide attempt a few
days after his arrival in Russia; his demanding and arrogant ;
personality and critical remark; about the Soviets contained in his
diary, in correspondence with toe American Embassy in 1961 and his
correspondence with his mother snd prother in 1961-62. It is”
inconceivable that the Soviets vould have used an individuel of this
kind to carry out assassination of teaders of Western countries
even if the Soviets have such plans.

ACTION:
@ ‘ None. The above is for information.
