On the afternoon of 3/3/64, the informant advised
SIEGEL, acting as an intermediary for another ‘individual, was
| going to put up $1,300 in good money for $6,500 of the counterfeit
: $20.00 bills. The good money was reportedly to be delivered to
‘ SIEGEL at approximately 3:00 p.m., on 3/3/64, at which time ar-
rangements would be made for the delivery of the counterfeit |
i money. The informant was going to attempt to identify "JOE"
| as he contemplated being vital A surveillance by Bureau
Agents at the residence of JOE ME reflected he arrived on
the afternoon of 3/3/64 at his residence at 3:15 p.m. He re~'
mained for seven minutes, thereafter departed, and proceeded
alone in his car to the vicinity of Meridian and Arthur Godfrey
Road on Miami Beach. For security reasons it was not possible
to determine whether MEROLA carried anything. from his residence,
nor his immediate action following his arrival in the vicinity
of Arthur Godfrey Road. -
MM 913-C subsequently advised that he had gone with
SIEGEL ‘to the Royal Caste on Arthur Godfrey Road, which is
located at 780 Arthur Godfrey Road, and thereafter proceeded
to a vacant area near there and found in the bushes a package
containing $6,500 in counterfeit money. SIEGEL, who owed the
informant some money, then gave the informant ten of the counterfeit
$20.00 bills as part payment. :

It was previously. learned from Departmental Attormey
WILLIAM S. KENNEY, at Miami, that MEROLA had advised him that
PHIL MAINER and his brother from Cleveland had a large amount
| of counterfeit money and that MEROLA had actually furnished
‘to KENNEY some of the counterfeit bills. . MEROLA, with KENNEY,
discussed the matter with Secret Service at that time and KENNEY
advised that he was displeased with MEROLA inasmuch as MEROLA
would not go along with the government in an attempt to recover
the money and arrest the individuals with the same. KENNEY ad-
vised he instructed MEROLA at that time to have nothing to do

with the matter and he should not handle it.
