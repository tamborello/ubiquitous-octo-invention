CONSIDERATIONS

‘Possible future use in communications and support.

Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose
of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions
controlling these factors. If the recruitment and train-
ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit-
ment and training will be much less difficult than if
they are limited to intelligence -collection purposes
only,

There are "colonies" in Washington, D.C., and other
U.S. cities which are "little Cubas, " Family, Church,
and business interests provoke unusual personal ties
inside Cuba for some of these residents; a real potential
exists for collection of intelligence net otherwise avail«
able, {FBI support and coordination is basic in this
effort.) ;

As Opa-Locka becames fully activated, CLA will activate

other interrogation centers as romptly as feasible. A
center is being activated [a INegotiations with

‘local authorities are being undertaken to activate can ers,

 

if possible,

   

 

are being sur-

 

OF pOSSsi
port by others as necessary.)
