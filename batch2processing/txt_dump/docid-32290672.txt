adventurer. and mercenary, in July, . 1970, advised he was
involved in a plan to effect warfare between the United

RE: IVAN VIDAL SANTIAGO

; OLLER said he interviewed HEMMING and HARGRAVES
and found their claims highly unlikely in that they do not
possess the knowledge, money, equipment, or personnel
necessary: for such an ambitious project. OLLER stated
that they devised an unworkable scheme and then unsuccess-
fully contacted different U. S. Government agencies to
obtain backing and support.

OLLER stated their scheme had been discontinued,
_never had any potential for success, and it .would be a>
matter of time until they came up with some other equally
proposed unrealistic venture.

; MM T=1, who is a close friend and associate
of VIDAL, HARGRAVES, and HEMMING, in February, 1971, advised
that they have completely discontinued their plans and

“. at the present time are inactive in Cuban revolutionary

Matters. HARGRAVES continues to claim he has a back:

‘ailment and cannot work as a construction laborer.

HEMMING is now associated with Captain. (First Name -
Unknown) MILTON of Miami in a‘ business of delivering

‘commercial type Fishing boats from Norfolk, Virginia .
to Miami, Florida. They also plan to deliver some

of these boats to Nicaragua. :

MM T-1 stated that VIDAL continues to live in

' the Cuban exile colony in-Miami, is considered inactive,

and is not significant in Cuban exile political matters.

RE: IVAN VIDAL SANTIAGO; sbi he feet
ROY EMORY HARGRAVES; fic 7ABL Poeéce,
GERALD PATRICK HEMMING ;
INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA . .

  

It is noted that ROY EMORY HARGRAVES, an American
adventurer and mercenary, in July, 1970 advised he was
involved in a Plan along with Miami Cuban exile IVAN VIDAL

he was Closely associated in this plan with GERALD PATRICK
HEMMING, another American adventurer and mercenary, and a
long time friend and associate of IVAN VIDAL SANTIAGO,

On December 23, 1970, Detective VINCENT OLLER,
Dade County, Florida Department of Public Safety, Miami,
Plorida, advised that he had been notified by the u. s.
Coast Guard and U. 5s, Customs Agency Service, Miami,
Plorida, that VIDAL, HEMMING, and HARGRAVES were involved
in a plan for military Operations against Cuba.,.

OLIER said that these three individuals are
well known in the Miami area, their credibility is seriously
doubted, and because of this, the above Pederal law
enforcement agencies have discounted their Claims and
turned the matter over to local authorities.
