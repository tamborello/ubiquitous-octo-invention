Informant advised that he contacted FRANK
PALERMO on July 2, 1963, in an effort to determine what
had occurred at the Rondout gambling establishment on
June 28, 1963. He advised that FRANK simply told him
that he "would have to watch TV a few nights" and did
not explain his comments further. Informant advised that
FRANK left. him with the impression that the game will be
going again in the future; however, that for some reason
it would remain down for a period of time.

CG 6443-C advised SA MEINCKE on July 5, 1963,
that on July 3, 1963, KRUSE had asked the informant. to
see one HARRY LEVINSON, who owns and operates a pawn
shop on Clark Street and Chicago Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.
LEVINSON has a home at 4200 Marine Drive, Chicago, next
to the Imperial Towers, KRUSE suggested that the informant
try to interest HARRY LEVINSON in an even swap of property
at 4200 Marine Drive, for KRUSE's Lake Worth, Florida home.

Informant advised that ROCCO POTENZA, on July
3, 1963, in the late afternoon, visited the H and H
Restaurant, where KRUSE also hangs out, and asked MAISHE
BAER to hold his bankroil, consisting of $48,000. POTENZA
asked BAER to hold it until he came back, stating he was
going to a lawyer's office in the Metropolitan Building,
at 134 North La Salle Street, Chicago, and did not want
to carry the money with him.

CG 6443-C advised SA MEINCKE on July 18, 1963, that
he recently saw KRUSE in conversation with PETER EPSTEEN and
a lawyer by the name HENNESSEY, formerly a city attorney for
Skokie, Illinois, and a personal friend of KRUSE, in conversa-
tion at the Hyatt House on Lincoln Avenue, in Skokie. From
portions of the conversation that he could hear, the informant
learned that apparently KRUSE is interested in something in
Jamaica, and may fly there on a vacation trip with his wife
in the near future,

They mentioned that one WALTER LENRROT (phonetic),
a friend of MEYER LANSKY of Miami, is presently in Jamaica,
conducting some sort of financial investigation. It was
mentioned during the conversation that the government owns
the gambling interests in Jamaica, and there was an indica-
tion that KRUSE was extremely interested in this arrangement.

With reference to HENNESSEY, the informant advised
that: KRUSE leans on him for legal advice, and he visits KRUSE
at his home frequently, particularly on Sunday mornings.

Subsequently, KRUSE advised that. he is going to
take a trip of several weeks duration with his wife, and.
has instructed the informant to purchase some luggage
for him. The informant stated it is unusual for KRUSE
and his wife to visit their son two weeks in a row, and
the current visit is probably due to the fact that KRUSE
and his wife are planning a trip of several weeks duration;
therefore, the informant places credence in KRUSE's conversa-
tion,

Informant also advised at this time that he had
seen HARRY LEVINSON, as requested by KRUSE, regarding the
swap of property. LEVINSON's attitude was that he would
not even consider such a swap, and this deal will never
materialize.

CG 6443-C advised SA MEINCKE on August 16, 1963,
that he had a meeting scheduled with KRUSE for 4:15 P.M. on
this date; however, KRUSE did not show up. Informant
said he waited in MAISHE BAER's H and H Restaurant until
later that evening when KRUSE'S son appeared and stated that
his father had been called out hurriedly on a quick business
trip. Destination was not mentioned; however, the informant
felt that KRUSE must have flown to the Dominican Republic,
as he had indicated previously, that this trip was coming
up. He advised that KRUSE, according to previous state-
ments, would have to be back by August 20, 1963, as he
planned to drive to Culver Military School to bring his
youngest son back to school.

CG 6443-C advised SA JOSEPH G. SHEA on May 24, 1963,
that he recently learned from LESLIE KRUSE, en route to
O'Hare Field, where KRUSE was toxtake a plane to Florida,
that KRUSE is greatly concerned, and stated that the "G"
must have an "outfit" guy as an informant. KRUSE stated
their information is very accurate lately concerning some
matters. KRUSE speculated the informant has to be an
individual very close to the outfit. KRUSE stated they
suspected FRANK FERRARO, since they consider him a weak
individual; and they also suspect former alderman JOHN
D'ARCO, as well as LOUIS BRIATTA, as the informer.

CG 6443-C advised SA SHEA on June 14, 1963, that
KRUSE intended to leave for New York, this date, where he
stated he was going to visit a medical specialist for a
kidney or bladder disease. Informant stated that KRUSE
has been instructed by his Chicago doctor to maintain a
careful diet, and to visit the specialist in New York City.
He said that, during this conversation, KRUSE made the
remark, "This is the beginning of the end for the rackets.
Everybody is a stool pigeon, even our own guys are leaking
the information, and the FBI is over zealous. Everything
is locked up." During this conversation, KRUSE talked
again about his pet peeve, which is the Hot Springs,
Arkansas ,area3z. where gambling operates wide open in
Senator MC CLELLAN's home state. KRUSE cannot understand
why gambling flourishes in Hot Springs, where it is against
state law; and yet, here in the local area of Chicago,
gambling is being closed down, largely by the FBI.

 

CG 6443-C advised on June 21, 1963, that he had
talked with KRUSE recently, and KRUSE had discussed a
gambling venture, presently in the development state, in the
Dominican Republic. KRUSE admitted that he has been making
frequent trips to the Dominican Republic from Florida, for
the purpose of establishing gambling there, KRUSE said
this is a perfectly legal venture, and that the financial
backers of the operation in the Dominican Republic will be

KRUSE; RALPH PIERCE ; MMEYER LANSKY, top hoodlum of Florida;
ROCCO FISCHETTI; JOE FISCHETTI; JOHN DREW, Las Vegas gambler;
and PETE LICAVOLI, Detroit hoodlum.

Informant stated that KRUSE said he intended to
make additional trips to the Dominican Republic, by way of
Florida, and that he might use the informant as a courier
for him to the Dominican Republic; and, on occasion,
might have the informant accompany him on this trip.

KRUSE indicated further that, when he makes the
trips to the Dominican Republic, he picks up envelopes
and letters to be delivered to persons there. KRUSE
indicated that he makes the trip approximately every
two weeks,

CG 6443-C advised SA WILLIAM A. MEINCKE on
July 2, 1963, that he recently learned that one HERBERT
MESSE, an individual recently appointed by Mayor DALEY to
the City of Chicago Zoning Appeal Commission, has been
going recently to the Rondout and Old Homestead gambling
establishments run by MC GUIRE, SMITH, and GRIFFIN...

The informant advised that he learned through
MC GUIRE that on the night of June 28, 1963, the Sheriff
of Lake County had plannéd a raid at the Rondout gambling
establishment and that apparently he had secured a warrant.
MC GUIRE stated that "the whole thing was tipped early in
the day." MC GUIRE did not elaborate further, however,
Stated that CHUCK SMITH had received a phone call in the
afternoon of June 28, 1963, apparently alerting him to the °
possibility of a raid that night. MC GUIRE stressed in his
conversation that the tip came from a "civilian" and not
a law enforcement agent. MC GUIRE went on to say that
about 9:30 P,M, another phone call had been received at the
Rondout establishment confirming the fact: that there would
be a raid that night, Thereafter, MC GUIRE advised “he

hurriedly got rid of the few gambling customers who had
appeared that night. MC GUIRE laughed and said that

they had to get their own cars, and several of the patrons
got their clothing all messed up falling in the mud next
to the parking area.

It is to be noted that the raid was planned by
the Lake County Sheriff's Office based on information
supplied by the FBI. A warrant and complaint had been
issued by the Lake County State's Attorney's Office concerning
this raid. The warrant and complaint were drawn on the
afternoon of June 28,.1963.,

Informant advised that MC GUIRE also told him
that SMITH in particular was really shaken up by the impending
raid. MC GUIRE advised that they felt they could control
all the law enforcement agencies in Lake County but if they
were forced to act in some way their control was lost and
this made SMITH and GRIFFIN extremely dubious.

MC GUIRE advised that SMITH told him that he
did not want any more of the gambling in Lake County
advising that he was wealthy in his own right and: "too 6id”
to take any more chances," .

The informant advised that the matter at present
is "up in the air" with the gambling shut down at least
temporarily, if not permanently. He advised that MC GUIRE
and his associates were all lamenting the fact that they
were shut down before their big week end, that of the 4th
of July.

CG 6587-C-TE advised SA MEINCKE on July 3, 1963,
as follows:

Informant advised that he was present at the
Rondout gambling. establishment on Friday, June 28, 1963,
He advised that he arrived at the establishment about
8:45 P.M, and immediately sensed that something was
different from any other night. he had attended this
establishment. He advised that between 8:45 and 9:30 P.M.
