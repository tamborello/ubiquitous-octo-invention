WFO 92-733

WASMAN, JACK LASOMAN, WASHERMAN, WATSERMAN, etc., as
appear in the person to person toll call records, are
apparently phonetic spellings for JACK WASSERMAN since
all numbers are listed to him.

WFO indices contain no references to DONN S. MITCHELL.
A call to 223-2858 revealed that this number was disconnected;
however; his residence number in Alexandria, Virginia, is
still active.

-- Info re subscriber to telephone number furnished
by CS WF 1499-C to SA JAMES GAFFNEY, 4/13/67.
