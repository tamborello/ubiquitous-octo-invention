In reference to information received during the early

part of March concerning pay offs to First District policemen,

it was pointed out that syndicate strip joints were being .
assessed $300.00 a month. It has since been learned from

CG 6443-C that this sum has been raised to $1,000 per month

from each club. This information would appear to corroborate
‘the feeling of the Chicago Division that gambling operations

are down within the First District. On the basis of a

$1,000 assessment from each club the total take for the month

of January would have been $9,000. Substracting the $4330.00

pay off to First District police for protection this would

still leave approximately $4700.00 for splitting among

syndicate leaders as well as miscellaneous expenditures.

It is assumed that of this amount in all probability approximately
$4,000 would be passed from MARCY to an individual probably
either GUS ALEX ox FRANRLFERRANQ.. From past information obtained
a further split wdéu s“made of probably 50-50 between the
FERRARO-ALEX organization and HA ANCANA- ~
