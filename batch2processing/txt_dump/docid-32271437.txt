xX After interviewing Sylvia Duran and Eusebio Azcue
<Ythe cc Committee has found conflicting stories. Ms. Duran
é told the Committee that Lee Harvey Oswald visited the
) Cuban Consulate on three occasions, all on September 27,
1963. (HSCA Interview of Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78, JFK Docu-
\ ment. No. , p. 523) This contradicts her statement
to the Mexican officials that Oswald had visited the Con-
sulate on two occasions, both.on September 27, 1963. (See
section entitled Version of Interrogative Given to. the
Warren Commission by Mexican Government. ( (Also, see sec-
tion entitled Original Signea Statement of Sylvia Duran
- Interrogation by the Mexican Government.) Though neither
report quotes Tirado as stating that Oswald's visits were
on September 27, 1963, she states that they occurred on

the same day in late September or early October: (Ibid.)

When the House Select Committee on Assassinations checked

Oswald's visa application, the date September. 27, 1963

was clearly markegbn it. (See Oswald Visa application.)
Mr. Azcue remembered three visits to the Cuban Con-

sulate occurring on different dates. Mr. Azcue stated

that Oswald's first visit would have been "one or two days

prior to the date on the visa application at around 1:00

p.m." (HSCA Interview of Eusebio Azcue, 1 JFK

presented evidence that he had been in Russia for three
years, that he was married to a Russian woman and also

that he was the leader of an organization in New orleans
called "Fair Play for Cuba." Sylvia Duran stated that
Oswald stressed that his visa application should be accepted
as he was a friend of the Cuban Revolution. (Ibid. p- 39)
Sylvia Duran stated that there, in compliance with her
duties, she had Oswald fill out the appropriate application
(Ibid. p. 39). Oswald then left and returned in the after-
noon with the necessary photographs. (Ibid. p-.- 39) Ms.
Duran stated that at that time, exceeding her duties, ~

she telephoned the Russian Consulate because of her interest
in. facilitating the handling of the Russian visa for

Lee Harvey Oswald. (Ibid. Pp. 39) The Russian Embassy told
Duran that there would be a delay of approximately four
months in processing the case, which annoyed Lee Harvey
Oswald since, according to his statements, he was ina

great hurry to obtain a visa to travel to Russia. He

jiinsisted on his right to obtain a visa in view of his back-

ground and activities on behalf of the Cuban movement. (Ibid.

p- 39) When Oswald understood that it was not possible
to give him a Cuban visa without previously obtaining a

Russian visa, he became extremely angry. (Ibid. p- 39)

At this point Ms. Duran stated she called Consul Azcue,
who, at that time was in his private office accompanied

by his upcoming replacement Alfredo Mirabal. (Ibid. p. 40)
Mr. Azcue came out of his office and argued with Oswald

in English. (Ibid. p. 40) Ms. Duran stated that Mr.

Azcue told Oswald that a person like him instead of aiding
the Cuban Revolution, did it harm. (Ibia., p. 40) . Oswald
at that point stated that he had two reasons for request-
ing his visa with such urgency: one, that his Mexican per-
mit expired soon; and two, that he needed to reach Russian
soon. (Ibid., p. 40) Sylvia’Duran stated that in spite

of the argument she gave Oswald a pice of paper with her

name and Consulate business phone number (11~28-47) (Ibid., |

p. 40) Ms. Duran stated that she also initiatea the handl-
ing of his visa application by sending it to the Cuban
Ministry of Foreign Relations, from which a reply was re-
cevied in the normal manner some fifteen to thixty days
later approving the issuance of: an intransit visa on

the condition that he previously obtain a Russian visa.
(Ibid. p. 40) Mrs. Duran stated that she does not recall

whether Oswald subsequently called her on the Consulate

phone number which she had given him. (Ibid. p. 40) Sylvia

Duran stated that all the conversations that Eusebio Azcue

. and she had with Oswald were in the English language since
