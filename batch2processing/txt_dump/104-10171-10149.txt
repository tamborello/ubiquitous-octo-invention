REFUGEE LEADERS PLEA

We, the undersigned representatives of the European pooptes subj.
gated by Communist tyranny, uegently appeal for support for the rer,
Curtain Refugoo Campaign of the international Rescue Committee in
its prosent emergency. wo ‘

The nature of tho escapee's first contact ‘with the Western world is
of the greatest importance. Ordinarily he reaches the free side of the
Iron Curtain completely without means and emotionally and physi-
cally exhausted from his harrowing ordeal. Although ho may be kent
alive in over-crowded camps, all too frequantly he exporiencas an.
almost total personal Indifference that embitters even the strongest
soul, Lo : a vr T
It is hardly possible te exaggerate the value of tho service which
the International Roacue Committoe has randarod to thosa whe have
succoedod in escaping from bohind the fron Curtain and te those who
have sufferad and continue to suffer In the fight for froodom and
democracy. . 7 So. :

The promptnoss with which the thternational Roscue Committse
has come to the assistance of those whe have escaped, and the
warmth and understanding displayed by its representatives have
been a souree of great spiritual encouragoment for the: refugees in
Europe. It has demonstrated to them thet on their Woy to freedom they
have. not been abandoned to their fate, It hes confirmed their faith in
democracy to the point where subsequent hardships could not destroy
it. it has proved to the world thet the right of asylum is not a mere
formality devoid of human. content. It has helped to keep clive hopo
for tomorrow in the breasts of all peoples who are today ensicved
by Communist tyranny, ;

It would bo a catastrophe of tho first order if this vital work wera te
corna ta an end for.lack of funds. The hardships of the refugeas would -
be increased many fold: and the Communist Propagandists would
gloat over the fact in many editorials and radio broadcasts,

" Out of the cacophony of the thousands of documcated reports,
- the “concentration camp man” emerges. He is nightmarishly
. typical. He is hungry, sick and afraid. He lives in wooden bar.
tacks, or under a tent, or in earth caves. His fate is locked be.
tween barbed wire barricades, beneath observation tewers, Unde
Constant threat of dogs and rifles, he works far beyond the powe
of his muscles. Given.neither the means nor time to wash, he wear
foulrags. He is awakened before dawn; at night, having returned
exhausted from work, he stands in an interminable line, near @ hos
pital'lacking medicaments. ‘In the middle of the night, in every
kind of weather, he is aroused. by blows to unload freight cars. This
is a faithful condensation. of hundreds of reports—end thousands
of such reports exist,

The world of the concentration comp keeps growing. Yester
day the Soviet Union had enly political. detention camps. The
cruel civil wer of the collectivizetion period started her on this en
terprise of forced labor which plays its part in every economic sec
tor, including scientific research. © The present network of camp:
spreads across Siberia to the White Sea and ihe Baltic, from th
very outskirts of Leningrad and Moscow to Baku.

_ During nearly their entire existence, the Nazi camps were bu
‘one apocalyptic aspect of a general pathological pattern. Onl
during the last years did they become an integral part of a suciet
founded on a new type of human exploitation. In Russia this devel
‘ opmicnt is entirely completed. The class that-organizes the camp
- is not threatened with extinction. It is in possession of all powe
}and firmly resolved to carve out its future, These camps are thu
an erpression of nofmal relations, the natural development. of
| new type of society. . And it is this unique quality of the Sovie
: system of concentration camps which fills us with such horror.
Iriagine the mass graves of the old Buchenwald erupting wit
_ 4 resurrection of their deed, delegates of @ protesting humanit
united on the great square.under the fleres and in the snow, lister

judge the safe, comfortable, intelligent citizens of the West wh
heard these new cries of terror and.did nething to aniwer?. Th
strongest obscenities would be too weak. Milions of men toda
suffer horribly, with no hope. so

Ido not ask the warld to state, “Concentration camps exist j
