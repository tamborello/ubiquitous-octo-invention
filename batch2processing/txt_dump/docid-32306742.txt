Former NY 3936-C-TE has demonstrated that he can
prepare extensive, detailed write ups on specific loans or
deals if given the opportunity to review his records,

-He has recently completed a write up on the Cashmere
loan, Bufile 156-249; NY file 156-73. This write up supported |
by documents and checks establishes a conspiracy to violate
Title 18, USC, Section 1954, in regard to a letter of commitment
given by’ Local 10, New York, New York, as well as monies loaned
to Cashmere by FRANK ZULFERINO of Local 10 and SANFORD POLLACK
of Local 875, IBT.

The direct knowledge of former NY 3936-C-TE does not
extend into that phase of this case involving the loan being
obtained from a Teamsters Union Pension Fund, although he: does
have hearsay information,

 

STEPHEN BIRNBAUM, who participated in the early phase -
of this case, has been contacted through his attorney, former uo
AUSA in the EDNY, resulting in their contacting AUSA MORVILLO,

MORVILLO has discussed this matter, making an offer of immunity

for BIRNBAUM. Authorization has been received from the

Baa of Justice authorizing immunity for BIRNBAUM as of
19/

With the testimony of former NY 3936-C-TE and BIRNBAUM,
it is felt that a conspiracy can be established which would
involve among others ZULFERINO, POLLACK, SHIAH M. ARSHAM, TRAVIS
S. LEVY, SAM BERGER and JAMES PLUMERI (intuential member in
notorious THOMAS LUCHESE "family" of LCN

It is anticipated that the Cashmere case will be the
first one aetna by the NYO utilizing information furnished ‘
by former NY 3930-C-TE. It is noted, however, that utilizing
information furnished by him and approaching this type of case
on the basis of conspiracies, the potential cases anticipated
to be developed will include the following members and fringe
associates of LCN:
