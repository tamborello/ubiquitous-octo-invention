Mr. David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Assassination Records Review Board
600 E Street, N.wW.

Washington, D.c. 20530

Dear David:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 12 September 1995
to Director of Central Intelligence Deutch describing the
Assassination Records Review Boards's most recent formal
determinations with respect to CIA records.

We have again reviewed the 43 documents which the Board
has decided to release now, either fully or with some
information postponed. Please advise the Board that the
Agency does not plan to appeal to the President for
additional postponements with respect to the documents listed
in your letter.

We note that further review will be necessary by December
1995 to determine if additional information in a number of the
documents can be released. We are prepared to discuss with
the Board and your staff any issues that may arise with regard
to declassifying and releasing CIA-originated information.

Sincerely,

John F. Pereira

Central Intelligence Agency + Washington, D.C. 20505 « (703) 3 51-2698 Fax (703) 243-8343
