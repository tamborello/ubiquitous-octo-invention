It. was determined that MICHELE MIRANDA
had not been in S. Giuseppe Vesuviano for many years
and did not maintain correspondence with his rela-
tives there.

The records of the Police Department, Naples, :
Italy, reflect that MICHELE MIRANDA, son of GIUSEPPE a
and .CARMELA AVINO, born in S. Giuseppe Vesuviano on
August 23, 1891, together with his wife, FILOMENA
AMBROSIO, " daughter of FRANCESCO and GIUSEPPA AMMIRATI ,
born August 10, 1898, in S. Giuseppe Vesuviano, both
U.S. citizens, lodged at the Hotel Oriente in Naples
in August, 1963. They departed on August 21, 1963,
enroute to Rome. . :

 

It was determined, however, that the MICHELE i
MIRANDA mentioned in the records of the Naples Police ‘
Department, is not identical with the captioned
MICHELE. MIRANDA, i
