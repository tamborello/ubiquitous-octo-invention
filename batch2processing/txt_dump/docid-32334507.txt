Robert B. DePugh, Noreborne Missour » is one of the
organizers of this group. Literature distributed by this
organization indicates its purpose to be the resistance

exposure of the spread of communist influence within
the United States and the formation of an underground
organization to combat the troops of foreign powers which
might occupy this country « According to a source, the
organization appears to legitimate and has 3,00 members
in 35 cities in the United States.

Los Angeles Office advised that a member of
"Minutemen" made the statement that the organization is
ready to take up active revolution against the United States
Government "should this country be sold down the river
through the United Nations." (It appears that this member
may not be referring to an active revolution against the
present Government of the United States but is referring
to the communist form of government which would be ruling
the United States "if the United Nations sells us down
the river.")° It is incumbent on the Bureau to be aware
of the plans, aims and purposes of "Minutemen" to determine
whether it becomes necessary to actively investigate it.

Each office should furnish the Bureau, 30 days
