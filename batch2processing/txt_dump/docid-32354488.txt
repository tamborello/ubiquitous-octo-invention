SUBJECT: Latin America Division/JFK Task Force How |

Research was Conducted

 

1. The LA Division Task Force to investigate records
in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy
was formally organized in mid-October 1976. Its.purpose,
basically, was to research all Agency operations conducted
against Cuba from 1 January 1960 to 1 January 1965 ,

(concentrating on the period up to 22 November 1963) for

any evidence that.such operations might have provoked the

Government of Cuba to take executive action against

President Kennedy. Researchers were also alert to activities
seemingly directed against the U.S. /CIA.

2. Reference to material for this research was obtained ~
from the LAD Registry, the Cuba Desk machine runs,, and a .
special comprehensive file listing prepared for this purpose
by ISS (Information Services Staff). It was originally
thought that material pertinent to the search would number
approximately 900 operational folders, plus related 201
dossiers. It was later determined, however, that a thorough
review should include additional operational and subjective.
files which brought the total to well over two thousand files.

In-view of the date of the material, much cf it, both operational

b. Criteria Used ‘in the Research:

 

As a guide the research group followed some
.33 Terms of Reference provided by the Deputy IG, which

were compiled on the basis of issues raised in Book V,

‘reading for the researchers. 5) In addition to the
Terms of Reference, the group remained alert to other.
items of interest brought to its attention ‘by the 1G
staff, on an ad hoc basis. A name trace was always -
run, and/or 201 dossier, if available, reviewed, on

any individual allegedly involved in an assassination

plot against President Kennedy or Fidel Castro. . This |

task was made somewhat easier as the result of a
memorandum prepared by the Cuba Desk, in August 1975,
based on traces of the names in the Black Book that
Fidel Castro. passed to George McGovern which dealt
with individuals allegedly involved in assassination, ;

attempts against Castro.
