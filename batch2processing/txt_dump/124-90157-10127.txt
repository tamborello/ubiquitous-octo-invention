NOTE CONTINUED:

sent to DIA employee by subject containing extremely radical
language, expressing regret that assassins failed to kill

CHIANG Ching-kuo and stating that group's moraleis very high now
and in future "anything can happen." DIA determined that subject
probably stayed in WDC at Shirlington House.

In view of subject's avowed propensity for violence,

investigation to be conducted expeditiously and Secret Service
kept advised.
