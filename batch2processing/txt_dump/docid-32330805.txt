with MARCELLO at the Town & Country Motel and was. introduced
by MARCELLO to a group of individuals whose names he does not
recall, who, according to\MARCELLO, were the majority stock- ‘
holders of the Sawyer Downs Racetrack which is located in the
Shreveport, La., area. Informant stated MARCELLO very firmly
stated he had no financial interests in this racetrack but
was endeavoring to assist the stockholders in the operation
of this track.

Informant stated: that MARCELLO and the stockholders
wanted him to complete the building of the track and then
wanted him to run the track. It wasv~his belief-.that while
MARCELLO stated he did not have any active interests in the
track, he wanted to be in a position to control the hard

’ gambling which would naturally follow from such an. enterprise.
