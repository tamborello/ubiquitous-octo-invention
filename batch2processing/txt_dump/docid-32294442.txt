The Miami Office is in the process of attempting
to obtain more extensive specimens of this Underwood type-
writer, as well as of all typewriters at the Abbey Clinic.
In the meantime, a cursory examination by Agents of this
office reflects that the above-described specimen obtained
by MM 635-S appears to be extremely similar to the typing
which appeared in the letter postmarked 9/28/64, sent to
ROBERTO MENDOZA - victim. For the information of the
Bureau, investigation to date has reflected that the Abbey
Clinic is in disrepute with the local Medical Association.
It has also reported that BOSCH is held in high regard by
the doctors who operate the Abbey Clinic. Consequently,
at this point it is felt that a direct approac o the
Abbey Clinic to obtain specimens is unwise. (3¢ zw)

its examination of the enclosé c :
