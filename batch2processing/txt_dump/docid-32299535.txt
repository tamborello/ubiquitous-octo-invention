Re report of SA STUART E, SCHEER at New Orleans dated

5/5/61.

.NO 1082 ~- C advised on July 24, 1961, that SAM SAIA,
a well known New Orleans handbook operator now operating in
Jefferson Parish, habitually places runners or agents in vari- ‘
ous barrooms throughout the city to collect bets. Source H
advised that SAIA has a runner at the Old Gem Bar, 127 Royal
Street, and Don's Bar, 141 Royal Street. Source advised that
the management accepts a payment for permitting these agents to
use facilities of the barroom but has no control over the actual
booking arrangements. Source advised that the usual payment for
using these facilities is approximately $75.00 a month, plus
the business which would develop by virtue of the individuals
making wagerers come'{nto the bar. Source advised that he did
not know the location through which the individuals taking the
bets place them with SAIA; however, he stated that no records
are kept by the individual faking the bet. They are immediately
telephoned to a central location in an effort to prevent the ;
New Orleans Police Department from effecting an arrest with ‘

sufficient evidence to charge the individual booking at these
locations. ; ;
