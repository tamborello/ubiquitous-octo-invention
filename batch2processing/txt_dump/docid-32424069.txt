. The forces in paragraph 3.a., above, would provide
excellent detection of shipping outbound from Cuba to
Latin America. ‘Their capabilities for visiting and ~
searching, trailing, and harassment would be limited,.
but could be improved, if shipping patterns were estab-+
lished. Rules of engagement are contained in ericlosure (5).

5. In summary, the concépt presented in this study would
be most effective, if visit and search were authorized.
Tracking ‘and trailing of all suspectéd arms carriers would

be difficult, if not impossible. However, tracking and
trailing could be undertaken on a selective basis. The
forces listed in paragraph 3.a., above, would be adequate
ever the short term. For long term operations a much
larger foree would become involved.
