These records showed that the residence of
VARONA was listed as Wesser #204 Rio Piedras Heights,
Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. This account is now inactive.

On 5/9/67 H.L.S. RYDIN, Accountant Operations,
Island Administration, First National City Bank, advised
SA GARY L. ENSMINGER that a review of bank records
failed to produce any record of an account of the subject
organization or HERNANDEZ. RYDIN stated that their bank
maintains a special checking account #528-870 and that -
the present balance is $47.51. VARONA's address was the
same as shown above.

   
   
 

advised that their records also contain
pecial checking account for one Mrs.
on #306, Jardines
hoo.kico. This is a
. The balance
of this account according, to RYDIN is $7211.57.

On May 24, 1967, Special Agent CHARLES L.
CAPEHART advised the review of records at Retail Credit
Bureau, San Juan, Puerto Rico, failed to disclose any
information identifiable with ABEL VARONA orhis wife,
Mrs. ABEL DE VARONA LOREDO.

The above information regarding review of bank
records pertaining to the ELC was not set forth in LHM
in view of the negative results of such checks. Although
bank records did reflect a special checking account of
over $7,000 for Mrs. ABEL DE VARONA LOREDO, apparently
the wife of ABEL VARONA, Treasurer of ELC, there is no
positive information as of this time that the money

‘maintained in this account is actually ELC funds and

therefore this information has not been set out in LHM.

San Juan office files failed to disclose any
derogatory data regarding LUIS VALLE or JOSE ERNESTO
MUZAURIETA.

The address San Jorge Number 269, 3rd Floor,
referred to herein as the address where "NINO" DIAZ was
residing while in Puerto Rico, is the residence of ,
