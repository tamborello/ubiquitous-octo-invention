Details: The JFK Task Force has been unable to procure printers
for the available computers. According to IRD, the remedy is to
connect the computers through the cables to a printer and utilize
fewer printers. Therefore, the JFKTF needs cables for 11
computers in Room 6362. This would also provide additional
access to FBINET and Electronic Communications.
