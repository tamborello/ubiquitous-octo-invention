Re: CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY UNIT

232 points on the same test, placing her in the higher levels
of those eligible for promotion. These test scores reflect
excellent potential for these employees in the Research Analyst
position. Unit Chiefs Jehn ¢. Gordon, Criminal Investigative
Division, end Charles N. Lunsford, Intelligence Division, have
rated the respective employees highly. Both employeea, after
an explanation of their propesed duties and responsibilities
in the Congressional Inquiry Unit, have expressed a desire te
be given this promotional opportunity. It ds reeemmended that
they be transferred to the Congressional Inguiry Undt on a
0-day trial basis.
