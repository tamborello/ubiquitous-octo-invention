5. Mr. Helms’ 3 dune 1964 memorandum for the Warren Commission on
the de Mohrenschildts ts attached at C. It describes the Agency's.
interest in- obtaining reports from Mr: de Mohrenschildt in 1957 as a ..
result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year. Contact Division (now 2 Soe
Domestic. Coliection Division = DCB) had its resident agent. in Dallas, ee
Nr. J. Walton.Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschiidt at that time. The 9 02 2
history of Mr:-Moore's relationship with Mr. de Mohrenschildt from 1957
to 1961 is also-attached at C. As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested — -
traces on Mr. de Mohrénschildt.. The trace results (attached at D) con-
tained sufficient derogatory information to preclude further extensive ~ ore
contact with the de Mohrenschildts. (An‘0S summary on Mr. de Mohrenschildt _
prepared ‘in response to: the current request is also. attached at dD. ) -
