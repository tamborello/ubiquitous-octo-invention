MEMORANDUM FOR:
SA/DCI
Office of the Director

FROM: John F. Pereira
C/Historical Review Group/CsI

SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Records

Per your request, attached are the two documents
referred to in the JFK Assassination Board's letter to
the Director of 31 July 1995. The sole remaining issue
concerned the release of the cryptonym “LIENVOY”. All
other issues have been resolved. We are discussing with

the DO the question of whether to appeal. In my view, we

are unlikely to appeal.
