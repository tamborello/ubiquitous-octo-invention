REFERENCE(S)

1. John CRYER arrived on 15 October 1959 and a survey was made of QDDALE's
office that same afternoon. Since QDDALE was expecting members of the FREYR2
group to visit him again on 16 October and since there appeared to be no particular -
technical difficulties in installing the equipment, it was decided to make the
installation that same night.

2. The installation involved several unforeseen difficulties but CRYER, with
éome strictly non-technical assistance from KARNLEY, managed to get the instal-
lation made during the night. On the morning of 16 October the equipment
was tested and QDDALE was given instruction on the uee of it. ‘The test was
excelient and QDDALE was very pleased with this performance.

3- With respect to the handling in the future, it should be realized that
a@ number of these interviews which are taped may be in Spanish and some assistance
therefore may be required in the processing of the tapes. Also, as you mow, ,
this office does not have a recorder on which these tapes might be played.
Initielly I intend to see if a recorder is not available on a loan basis from
the local KUCLUB people and perhaps they may even give an assist on transcribing
some of the tapes which come off in Spanish. Should the requirements be frequent
and time-consuming, however, some other arrangements will have to be made.
