_ August 10, 1976

In, response to inquiry by the Bureau, our
Los Anges Office has furnished a summary that would
provide logical motives which may have’ contributed
to the death of John Roselli, prominent West Coast
La Cosa Nostra (LCN) figure.

John Roselli was active in California and
Las Vegas in handling affairs for the Chicago LCN
family. Roselli, in the 1940's, was convicted for
the extortion of individuals in the movie industry
and was sentenced to 10 years. The primary witness
in this matter was killed as a result of a bombing
of his automobile.

In the late 1960's, Roselli was convicted for
entering this country illegally. He was sentenced
to 11 months in custody of the Attorney General.

At the ‘same time, he was convicted in a conspiracy
to violate the ITAR -— Gambling Statute. This involved
a scheme using electronic devices to cheat at the
famous Beverly’*Hills Friars Club, He was sentenced

: in this case to four years' custody of the Attorney
General. Because of his alien status, deportation
proceedings were brought against him by the INS.

He was ordered: deported, but this could not be
effected ‘because no country could be located who
would receive him. |

. In May, 1970, Roselli was called as a witness
before the FGJ,° “Los Angeles, dealing with the hidden
ownership of the Frontier Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada.
Roselli was granted immunity and testified before
this FGJ.He was quoted by newspapers. as saying,
"I'm doing my best to cooperate. I just hope I'm
doing the right thing." Subsequent to this, Detroit
LCN members were convicted in the Frontier Hotel

matter.

 

SD 1064-C-TE has speculated that Roselli was
| possibly killed because of his testimony before this
FGJ and’ the involvement of LCN figures in these cases.
Buréau informants are being contacted in this
matter. re you will be advised of — in
