Reurtel 5/3/61.

The information reported by CG 6443-C indicating

hugé gambling operations carried on in factories and business
places opens an avenue which may lead to interesting and signifi-
cant information as to hoodlum gambling operations. With this

in mind, you should exert every effort to develop further informa-
tion concerning bookmaking at factories and other business places
in order that a comprehensive picture of such activities may be
devdoped. You should attempt to establish the connection between
the individuals who actually operate these books. and. their
intermediaries who maintain liaison with and carry eut the orders
of the top-ranking Hoodlum figures who dominate this racket.

 

This matter should be given immediate and vigorous

attention, and the Bureau should be kept closely advised of
pertinent developments.
