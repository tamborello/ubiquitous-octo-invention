KENNEDY. FUNERAL

 

Representatives from all’ states te’ President KENNEDY's
funeral, scheduled for Monday noon, iticlude Heads of State,
Prime Ministers or ‘Foreign Ministers. In view'of this and
protocol involvéd, I -consider delegation inadequa'te
and would hunibly advise that considering yout own personal
friendship with. ‘tthe KENNEDY' s,,that you send the Foreign:
Minister or ‘Speaker of the National Assembly. or Minister:

Chief of Protecol, .to give prestige and political
importance to your representation. President KENNEDY 's ‘interest
in and his persona regard for you was such that Ad feel
sure a ministerial representation at his burial would bé greatly
appreciated by Mrs. KENNEDY and the administraticn and further
strengthen good relations between [__|ana the United States.

I should be’ most relieved if you would graciously and
favorably consider my suggesticn. Representatives should catch
Sunday's Pan,’American flight due here same night.
