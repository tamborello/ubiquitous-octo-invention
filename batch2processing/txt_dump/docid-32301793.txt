The attorney, named cura eriindicated that —

HEBERT Had contacted GILL and another’ MA LO attorney, Mr.

WASSERMAN, as well as CARLOS MARCELLO recently at MARCELLO's

camp at Little Farms, Jefferson Parish, HEBERT apparently

told MARCELLO and his attorneys that although he had told

the FBI or Justice Department attorneys that MARCELLO had

hired him to kill NOLE; that this had been Strictly oral and

he had never given a.written statement. He told MARCELLO's

attorneys that the FBI and/or the Justice Department attorneys

had offered him $75,000 to testify that he had been hired to

kill NOLE. Supposedly at this meeting with MARCELLO and his

attorneys, HEBERT gave a signed statement in which he has

allegedly related that he had never actually been contacted

by MARCELLO or anyone else to kill the Government witness

NOLE. Informant stated that supposedly HEBERT and the

MARCELLO attorneys are of the belief that the Government ;

does not know that HEBERT. has gone to MARCELLO and his

attorneys and given a statement refuting his previous

testimony as a Government witness,

Informant stated that GILL appeared to be very
optomistic that MARCELLO would be acquitted of the bribery
charges against him pending in USDC; further MARCELLO's
attorneys wanted the attempted murder and bribery charges
brought at the same time in USDC. Apparently the Departmental
Attorneys had requested the court to hear the bribery and
attempted murder charges separately, Informant also stated
_ that HEBERT had indicated toaMARCELLO and his attorneys that
he had been an undercover man for the Government in connection
with the JIMMY HOFFA case.

 

Informant also advised that BENNIE LE HANN, presently

Operating a motel and restaurant for CARLOS MARCELLO in '
- Alexandria, Louisiana, had bilked MARCELLO out of $25,000.

‘Informant did not know if LE HANN was still operating the

motel in Alexandria or not,

Informant also stated that GILL's former
investigator DAVE FAIRRIES (phonetic) had recently been :
operating a gas station on Airline Highway near the airport,
FAIRRIES had started this station on money loaned him or on
credit from CARLOS MARCELLO, FAIRRIES allegedly lost control
of this gas station as the gas company owning the station
learned of his past reputation, i i

. Informant also stated that a millionnaire by the
name of LEE RATTNER (phonetic) from Miami, Florida, was
coming to see CARLOS MARCELLO for a conference at Little
Farms to buy the acreage around Little Farms, Supposedly
the land involved was to be used as an expressway. ¢

Informant also stated that while riding around
with G, WRAY GILL, GILL stated he wanted to go to an address
on Loyola Avenue. to look at some stolen property he might
be able to use. He and GILL stopped at 4737 Loyola Avenue
and looked at some of the alleged stolen property which
’ . consisted of duplicating machines, dictaphones, IBM calculating
machines and the like,

. The above was considered very pertinent as it
indicates possible defense plans MARCELLO's attorneys may
use in MARCELLO's coming trial for jury tampering. It is
also considered good intelligence information concerning
the well-known New Orleans criminal attorney G. WRAY GILL.

On a 5/22/65 contact with informant, he advised
that he has been having considerable trouble with a well-known
madam KAY ROBERTS. ROBERTS: had taken over one of the informants
best prostitutes by the name of POLLY SUE HARRINGTON, In
connection with this, he-had put much "heat'! on ROBERTS and
HARRINGTON. HARRINGTON is a close friend of EARNEST PALMISANO,
who in turn is a very close associate of CARLOS MARCELLO, .
Apparently HARRINGTON told PALMISANO about informant's
possibly harming HARRINGTON. PALMISANO in turn went to
CARLOS MARCELLO who told. PALMISANO that if HARRINGTON could
come up with $500, MARCELLO would arrange to have four men
beat up the informant to where he would be hospitalized for
at least three months. The four men to be hired to beat up
the informant were to be lead by one of the CONFORTO brothers
named JUNIOR. The informant learned of this through HARRINGTON :
who apparently decided, at the last moment, that she did not
want the informant maimed.

Although the above is a minor instance, it points
out that CARLOS MARCELLO is an individual who can be contacted
to arrange for "muscle", It is also interesting to note that
informants have previously described the CONFORTO brothers ~
as being very important cogs in the Italian Criminal Element;
