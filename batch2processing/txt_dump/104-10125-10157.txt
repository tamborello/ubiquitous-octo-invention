. ~ MORE RACIAL TROUBLE PREDICTED

Ominous Warnings

Each spring of the past few years has evoked ;
prognostications from Negro spokesmen and public officials
in cities with substantial Negro populations to the effect:
that the enSuing. summer months would see outbursts of.

- racial violence. This spring the prophecies have been more
‘numerous and more ominous than ever, particularly those

voiced by Negro leaders.

: . ‘ "Phe war in Vietnam has strengthened the. forces ©
of bigotry and reaction," declared Martin Luther King,
President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC).-: "It has caused many young people to become
disenchanted with our society. The failure to solve the

‘ problems of our cities will ofily exacerbate the situation,
Bo’

and give the extremists on both sides a much more receptive

. audience, — Polarization of the race question in the ; :
United States won't merely mean outbreaks of violence. It
“will mean outright race wars in ‘some of our cities."
a s .

‘At least ten cities actoss’ the country were
described by King as “powder kegs" which could expldde
into racial violence this -summer. Among those cities he.

‘listed were New York City, Newark, Washington, Cleveland,

Chicago, Los Angeles, and the Bay’ area of California, ~
including Oakland. oo, ok . ;

' Sporadic youth-led riots throughout the country .
must be expected this summer and every summer for the
next decade, Bruce Coles, Program Director for the Chicago
Young Men's Christian Association, told the House :
Education Subcommittee. The continying tumult, according
to Coles, can be traced to a conflict between the promises
of an affluent society and society's limited ability to.
spread that affluence around,. Unable .to get jobs and rise
out of the slums, the youngsters-~mostly teen-age Negro
boys--simply "blame whitey and raise hell," he said.

Alienation and tension in some Negro neighbor
hoods “are reaching catastrophic proportions which can
iead to unprecedented explosions in 1967," warned
Edward Rutledge and Jack E. Wood, Executive Director and
Associate Executive Director of the National Committee
Against Discrimination in Housing, in an annual report,
Rutledge and Wood, who forecast racial disorders in 1965
and 1966, drew their conclusions from a study conducted
in 41 cities and 25 states during 1966. .

» Rutledge and Wood clained they found a conviction
among Negro youth that progress in civil rights will be
achieved through social turmoil, and they repeatedly
heard sucH comments in ghettos as "We need two and a half
more riots to get out of here," .

; “Hardly any community in this, country can call
itself imeune from trouble pity Summer, - declared
Floyd HcKissick, National Director of the Congress of

-Racial Equality (CORE).’ MéKissick placed Cleveland at

the top of his list of trouble spots, along with most

New Jersey cjties. Othex’ cities he enumerated were
New York City; Washington; Detroit; Chicago; Gary, Indiana;

‘St. Louis; East St. Louis, Illinois; Los Angeles: e

San Francisco; and Oakland.

*A Negro sociologist at Howard University,
Dr. Nathan Hare, sees a "very real" possibility of a
civil war between whites and Negroes in the United States.
"It’s going to be quite a while off yet--though not so &
far off as to be outside of our life span," ke said.
Dr. Hare, who describes himself as a "theorist" in the
“black power" movement, is actively spreading its
philosophy to Negro colleges across the country.

"Violence is the only way left to the black
man to achieve his manhood in America," Ernest Chambers,

‘a leader of young militants in Omaha, told delegates to

the National Conference on Community Values and Conflict
in New York City. He said that "violence purges the

soul of the black man and returns to him his self-respect."
Chambers maintained that prevention of racial violence

was up to the white people, They must realize, he said,
that injustice is practiced daily against the Negro and
that Negro youths will no longer put up with it.

cosmunities into white neighborhoods and that increased

numbers of white people might resort to violence in an

effort to counter Negro demonstrators or rioters. The |

threat of racial violence hangs heavy over every urban .
_comaunity in the land. In an atmosphere of ever-present -
tension, violence can. strike anywhere at any time with
‘all the unpredictability, rapidity, and destructiveness
of a tornado. ae ;

- -Givil Rights Linked with Vietnam
: ,Host of the riots and disturbances of the past -
. three years have been spontaneous eruptions of sob
--yiolence, triggered by sone trivial incident and. fueled
py teen-age-Negro youths and various. lawless and. -
irresponaible ghetto elements. But incessant agitation
and propaganda on the part of communists and other —
subversives. and extremists ‘have definitely contributed
to Negro unrest. and fomented Violence. In particular,.
‘demagogues like Martin Luther King,, Stokely Carmichzel,
Floyd HcKissick, Cassius, Clay, and. Dick Gregory have
: fanned the fires of: racial discord. and animosity. King
. has now joined Carmichael,, licKissick, and other civil
rights extremists in embracing the communist tactic of
linking the civil rights novement with the anti-Vietnan-
war protest movement, claiming that United States e ‘
‘involvement in Vietnam is diverting attention from civil
rights. King's exhortation to boycott the draft and refuse -
to fight could lead eventually to dangerous displays of
civil disobedience and near-seditious activities by Negroes
and whites alike. Thus, the antiwar campaiga endorsed .
by. King helps to promote communist aims and programs in
the United States and abroad. :

Continuing Racial Tension

‘ . WON g ered bp Ae

OVERVIEW

After three consecutive summers of racial
turbulence in the United States, there were hopes that
the social, economic, and political gains achieved by
the Negro in recent years might be alleviating racial —
unrest and strife, Civil rights legislation, antipoverty
programs, and better police-community relations have
brought a measure of improvement in the status and
treatment of ‘Negroes, but discontent and frustration
persist. “Race relations have deteriorated in a number
of cities throughout the country during.the past year.

Seasonal Phenomevion com Oa

Ry 4 ;

We are now in the midst, of “an éra of protracted
racial conflict that haS produced a crisis in law enforce-
ment. Along with the annual seasonal rise in summertime
crime, it is, painfully evident that racial turmoil has
similarly become a summer phenomenon. The racial violence
potential is especially high in hot weather in the Nation's
urban areas because large numbers of Negroes, living
under crowded, depressed conditions in ghettos, take to
the streets to escape the heat and seek relaxation and
recreation. The situation is compounded by. the restiveness
and alienation of large numbers of idle junior and senior
high school students and other Negro youths. Because of
the combustible temper of the times, an inconsequential
incident can ignite a riotous situation in any city or town .
in the country. . . : H

 

Another Riotous Summer |

The Spring of 1967 has already witnessed almost
daily outbreaks of racial disorder somewhere in the country. |
All signs point toward recurrent racial convulsions through~ :
out the country this summer-~more than likely on an even
wider scale than in previous years~-marked by plundering, |
arson, destruction, and attacks on law enforcement officers.

There is the added danger this year that the scenes of : |
racial strife in large cities might spread from Negro
