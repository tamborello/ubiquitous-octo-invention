20 THERE FAS BEEN SOME SORT OF ASSASSINATION RUMOR oN THE

AVERAGE OF ABOUT ONE IN EVERY TEN DAYS SINCE | HAVE BEEN HERE,

AND WE HAVE BRUSHED THEM ASIDE. BUT THE RUMORS IN ABOVE-MENTIONED
} CABLES ARE SUFFICIENTLY BELIEVABLE To WARRANT FRESH STATE-DEFENSE
i - PLANNING ON TWO MAJOR POINTS: :

As. IF 1 AM ASSASSINATED IN THE WAY INDICATED IN ABOVE REPORTS, -

_ THE DEED WILL IN EFFECT HAVE. BEEN DONE BY THE GYN RPT GYN,
HOWEVER MUCH THEY ATTEMPT TO DISGUISE IT, SINCE THEY. WiLL. HAVE
INSTIGATED | THE MOB AND WILL HAVE DENIED US THE POLICE PROTECTION
WHICH THEY ARE TOTALLY CAPABLE OF GIVING US IN VIEW OF THE VERY
LARGE POLICE FORCE IN SAIGON WHICH 1S UNDER THEIR ABSOLUTE CONTROL«
THIS WILL, THEREFORE, AUTOMATICALLY CONSTITUTE A RUPTURE OF DIPLO-.,
MATIC RELATIONS AND MEANS THAT PRESENT ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING .

UsS. PRESENCE HERE WOULD BE FALSE. THIS WILL HAVE GRAVE CON-_

SEQUENCES FOR ALL AMERICANS IN VIET=NAM, NOTABLY AS REGARDS

_ EVACUATION AND THERE SHOULO BE FRESH CONTINGENCY PLANNING TO.
COVER THIS SITUATION.

 

Bo IF 1 AM ASSASSINATED, A NEW SITUATION WOULD BE CREATED
WHICH MIGHT GIVE US A CHANCE TO‘MOVE EFFECTIVELY FOR A CHANGE,
OF GOVERNMENT USING METHODS WHICH WOULD NOW BE REJECTED BY ULS..
AND WORLD OPINION, BUT WHICH WOULD THEN BECOME ACCEPTABLE.
THERE SHOULD BE. STATE-DEFENSE PLANNING ON THIS. |
