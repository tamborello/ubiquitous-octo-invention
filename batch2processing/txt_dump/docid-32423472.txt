Escambray, through a period of sevaral weeks and, you know, the

dark meetings andwwhatever.

Iwas directed-to meet one of the leaders of the Second
Front in Miami. We went to a Cuban safe house. There I was
introduced to a leader, Luis Guitterez Menoyo. After some
seven hours of discussion, he agreed to let me interview this
frogman, but I had to agree to go by boat, blindfolded. At
that time I was not permitted to leave and go back and call the
and get permiasion. I had to make a decision whether to
go or no go. So I did. I agreed. I was blindfolded, We
made a black entry out of Miami, past Immigration and Custonis.
They kept me below deck so I qouldn't see the compass.

We ended wp on a smail Island that I determined was
right off of Andros Island. They had a small base camp in
a former Portuguese sponge fisher village. The only thing
left was the conerete tanks and red£, They used the roof to
provide cover froin aerial surveillance.

n

i inserviewed the frogman, got the stery, came back
some ten days, 12 days later, as I recall, The Washington
community was flapping, where is Hubbard, at this point. Thy
report was favorably received, as I recall, and I was directes:
to maiatain contact.

This Guitterez Menoye never spoke English in my presence.

I was trying to think of it ~~ Hueget. Ralph was his first

name. He was allegedly a graduate of Georgia Tach. architec-
tural school, a very sharp young man, and I dealt primarily

with him because of the language barrier.

I was sent to Puerto Rico station because of French, to
work Haiti, and between Franch, arm and hand signals, and
English, I could communicate with Cubans.

But working with Hueget, they wanted us te support them,
us being the United States intelligence community.

I should regress. Although I was operating under a
pseudonym, I very definitely let them know that I was military
aS opposed to CIA because CIA had had the flap on the Bay of
Pigs. Menoyo had had many of the pecyle the CIA had trained
in the parachute school out on the Bay of Pigs thing, and the;
were very bitter, quite bitter. So I let them know that I
was miiitary support. Well, through negotiations, with sappro-
at the Washington level, we agreed to supply them small
arms, ammunition, rations and medical supplies in exchange for
permitting me to organize an intelligence net within their
unit, to send agents inte Cuba to develop a net within Cuba.

This was progressing quite well. I had picked this

Hueget as the team chief, to be the resident agent in Cuha,

We never unilaterally initiated an operation. We responded

to requirements, My first involvement with the Cubans was in

 

response to a requirement that picked up intelligence rumors
about a frogman operation against a Soviet sugar ship in

‘
Sago La Grande Harbor, Cuba, and which thera was something

unusual about this ship. This was immediately following ths
