"on. But anyway, so we go in there this morning, see, and
I see JACK GELLMAN (PH).

JAGK GELLMAN has been previously identified as
the former Niagara County District Attroeny and currently
the President of Consolidated Bowling Corporation. Both
CHESLER and GELLMAN were the original promoters of the
Consolidated Bowling Corporation, which operates bowling
alleys, motels, and hotels both in the United States and
abroad, :

. In describing the exclusive ownership of the

gambling casino by CHESLER and GROSS, NATARELLI remarked

ee ee nent

I don't care what ANGELO says, LOU CHESLER is originally
one of the Bay Street boys.” SCRO remarked "coompa, you
know LOU CHESLER is in with LANSKY, MEYER LANSKY, and VITO
ORDACRATELLI (PH) - they're the ones that do all the -
operation of it, do you follow me? ‘They're the ones that
bought this thing, coompa," whereupon NATARELLI remarks
"that's New York, you know." .

At this point, SCRO remarks that ANGELO (BRUNO)
was recently in the Buffalo area and had discussed this
matter with STEVE MAGADDINO. The discussion apparently
related to the transfer of the license or Exemption
Certificate and that JACK GELLMAN had been consulted about no
this matter, . ‘

; \
\ \
. According to SCRO, MAGADDINO told him that "if _
they're the only ones that got the license then you and I
got to go to New York and we'll straighten it out. If he's .
got the license and can get anybody he wants then I'll oS

come back up here and we'll straighten out up this end;
but the main thing is to find out first who's got it and
who can run it.

On 5/29/63, Constable ROBERT STONE, National
Criminal Intelligence Unit, Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
Toronto, was requested to develop any information he could
obtain concerning the background of Mrs. GEORGIA. GROSS ,
apparently the wife of WALLACE GROSS, and’ of hér: association
with LOUIS A, CHESLER of Toronto. It is noted that the
Royal Ganadian Mounted Police in Toronto is. familiar with

the background of CHESLER, having received inquiries from
London, England, and Miami, Florida, concerning his
operations. ;

In connection with this request, Constable STONE
was advised of the fact that the Buffalo FBI Office had
received information from a highly confidential source to

the effect that Buffalo criminals, including STEVE MAGADDINO,

had evidenced interest in attempting to place syndicate

money in a hotel-gambling casino operation, the license for
which had been obtained or was being obtained by LOU CHESLER

and Mrs. GEORGIA GROSS. ‘The Royal Canadian Mounted Police
was further informed at that time that this particular

license wa8s one issued by the Governor General of the Grand

Bahamas, entitling the holder to operate a gambling casino
and a hotel in the Grand Bahamas.

The Buffalo Office will continue to review the
information furnished by both BU 82-C* and BU 280-C* on
5/24/63, and subsequent dates concerning the developments
of this new gambling venture. It is noted that the names
VITO CRITELLI (Ey? agonen COLAVITO, POLITANG, and Mrs.

PH

GEORGIA GROSS are unknown to the Buffalo Office.
