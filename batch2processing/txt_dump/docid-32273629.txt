JUN 5 = 1975

Mr. John F., Blake

Deputy Director for
Administration

Central Intelligence Agency
Washington, D.C. 20505

Dear Mr. Blake:

In response to your letter of May 20, 1975, concerning a request

by the Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States for

aceess to CIA materials located in the Presidential library systen,

we. have notified the directors of the various Presidential libraries

and chave awked them to cooperate with tha Commission's representatives
4 in any. way possible. A copy of your letter authoriging access to

the materials "regardless of classification” was ineluded with our

notice to the libraries.

Since CIA materials may be found in numerous files among a library's
holdings, it will be necessary for a library staff member to work
closely with the Commission's representative to identify the perti-
nent’ material and te correlate these materfals with documents from -
other agencies whose permission for access has bean sought and
-granted. Therefore, in order to facilitate access, Mr. David W.
Belin, Executive Director of the Commission, should céntact the
library directo¥s individually regarding specific attangements for
authorized members of the Commission staff to visit a particular
Library.

| A list of the Presidential libraries, their addresses, and the names
of their directors is attaéhed. If there is any way in which I may
be of further assistanée, please don't hesitate to ¢all.

Sincerely, BBeasley/sb 6/4/75
