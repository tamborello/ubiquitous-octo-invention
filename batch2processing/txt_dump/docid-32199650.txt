In the March 12, 1992 letter, WHITE expresses his
concerns possible inmate retribution.

 

The January 21, 1992 airtel from Washington Field
Office to the Director has been provided as background
information.

Houston should be advised that prior to working as
the AUSA, JARRETT worked as an Assistant District Attorney
for Dallas County. JARRETT’s first contact with WHITE
occurred when WHITE sent in an unsolicited letter to JARRETT
regarding the involvement of an individual in a rape case
which JARRETT was handling. As a result of testimony WHITE
provided, a conviction for aggravated rape was obtained by
JARRETT in state court against an individual by the name of
MARIO GARCIA. AUSA JARRETT advised that he never promised
WHITE anything for his testimony in the GARCIA case.
