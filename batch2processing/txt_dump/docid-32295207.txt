" OO on July 1, 1965, U. S. Customs, Miami, advised
that sources and informants developed in the case "ROBERTO
ALEJOS ARZU, IS - GUATEMALA; NEUTRALITY MATTERS," Bufile |
2-1901, are also involved in this matter and started
reporting information concerning HEMMING's plans as soon
as the information was developed by other agencies. No
formal complaint, as such, was received by Customs. The
information was developed from contacts with established
sources.

The basis for Customs’ investigation is to So
ascertain if arms or articles of war may be illegally
exported from the United States.

Customs stated that their inquiry to date
ref Ho) beet the same information as reported by (CIA
anapieit) Customs has not written any reports and infor-
ion developed by Customs is nothing that would
gnificantly affect investigation being conducted by
es or, 7

ACB, the Miami Office plans no further active
investigation but will follow this matter through
MM 639-S, who is in constant and daily contact with
HEMMING, The Bureau will be kept advised and the infor-
mation wil begrieported in form suitable for dissemination.
