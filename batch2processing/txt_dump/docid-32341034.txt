- EXPEDITO FELIX ROBERT SANTIAGO;
SAMUEL SAMUEL F. BENTON BENTON

SANTIAGO claims to be employed as the Miami Representa-
tive of the Inter Change Bank at Chiasso, Switzerland. He had
in his possession two checkbooks from this bank and states
that he is in a position to accept signature cards from
Prospective clients and immediately turn over checkbooks
when deposits are made.

SANTIAGO was held by the French Police during the
night of September 16, 1966; was released at approximately
noon on September 17, "1966, and was summoned to reappear at
9:00 AM on September 19, 1966, His passport was held by
the French Police as assurance of his return, The. rubber
stamp from the Franklin National Bank was seized by the French
Police and will be turned over to. the Public Prosecutor of
Paris for disposition, .

At the time SANTIAGO returned to the French Police
headquarters at 9:00 AM, September 19, 1966, and since it
had been determined that he was not wanted for arrest in the
United States, his passport was returned to him by the French
Police and he was discharged from further appearance, |

Investigation by the PJSN determined that on the
afternoon of September 17, 1966, one SAMUEL F, BENTON ©
attempted to contact SANTIAGO at the George V Hotel, Paris.

It was determined by the French Police that BENTON was °
residing at the Paris Hilton Hétel. He was contacted there
and was brought to French Police headquarters for questioning,

BENTON identified himself as a private detective
in Miami, Florida, and had as proof of this a private detective's
license and badge. He stated that he has no criminal record
and is well known to the Miami Police because of his occupation,
A thorough search of his baggage, brief case and clothing by
the French Police failed to disclose any evidence that BENTON
was involved at this time in the negotiation of stolen or |
false securities.

BENTON stated that he knows SANTIAGO as an:
acquaintance in Miami and that they had agreed to meet in
Paris, but stated that there was no significance to their
meeting. He stated that they had merely decided to see Paris
together,

September 17, 1966, that the French Police had been alerted
by the police of Milan, Italy, that EXPEDITO FELIX ROBERT

i suspected of having been involved in a holdup in New York

5 City, New York, He was reported by the Milan Police to be

The French Police intercepted SANTIAGO at the time
of his arrival at Orly Airport, Paris, on the evening of .
September 16, 1966. His baggage, brief case and clothing
were thoroughly searched by the French Police and nothing
unusual was noted other than a rubber stamp which reads as
follows: "Signatures Guaranteed, Franklin National Bank,
Madison Ave., New York City, Ne Y." 74

SANTIAGO admitted that this is the type of rubbe
stamp used in the transfer of stock certificates but denied
that he had anything to do with such activities. He advised
the police that he had found this rubber stamp at Kennedy
i International Airport, New York City, when he was boarding ‘|
the plane for Italy and that he had intended to return it by \
' mail to the Franklin National Bank but had neglected to do

so. In spite of questigning by the French Police, SANTIAGO ~
I stuck to this story. - .

. Enclosed herewith for the Bureau are the original
and six copies of a Letterhead Memorandum, dated October 19,
1966, prepared at Miami pertaining to EXPEDITO FELIX ROBERT

-SANTIAGO. and SAMUEL FINK BENTON, copies of which are to

be forwarded to the Legats at Bem, Paris, and Rome. One
copy, together with a copy of the Letterhead Memorandum,
is designated for the New York Office for information.

: he i i in the Miami files concerning
IIIT fetore to nlp senvices as
a Potential Security. Informant - Venezuela in connection with
his association with MARCOS PEREZ JIMENEZ.

None of the Special Agents in the Miami Office
currently handling ITSP matters have any information concerming
the activities of SAMUEL FINK BENTON which would relate in
any way to the information-in the Letterhead Memorandum
prepared by the Legat in Paris.

There is no information in the possession of the
Special Agents of the Miami Office that EXPEDITO FELIX ROBERT
SANTIAGO has been involved in the illegal transfer and
sale of securities.

As mentioned in the Miami teletype to the Bureau,
dated September 17, 1966, no warrants are known to be currently
outstanding against either SANTIAGO or BENTON.

It is not desired that SAMUEL FINK BENTON be
inéluded in the general appearance file of the Bureau at

this.time. There is definitely no reason to include SANTIACO
in such a file.
