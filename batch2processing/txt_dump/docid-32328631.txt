to Miami 4-26-59 after accompanying Fidel Castro in the United States
prior to Castro's departure for Canada, While rooming with Guerra for
several days, MM 635-S observed two copies of signed statements totaling
about 30 pages which had been given to SAs Robert James Dwyer and
George E, Davis, Jr., in Miami, These statements were kept in Guerra’s |
brief case, One statement appeared to be possibly a carbon copy of the
original and the other a typewritten copys ‘however, they did not appear
to be in any type of report form of the FBI. Guerra allegedly had these
statements with him on a recent visit to the Pentagon and may have
exhibited them to military representatives in Washington, MM 635-S

succeed ‘Captain Raul Cros as chief of Intelligence Section, CAF, and
he, the informant, is being named assistant ‘to Guerra. Informant feels
he can secure these statements and plans to bring them to the Miami Office
when he returns in four or five days if this can be done without detection,

OBSERVATIONS :: oo, REC- 74 7, G- Yes Le ao Z d bo "

It appears very possible that the CAF has not. actually obtained
a copy of a FBI report but has secured copies of signed statements —
furnished the FBI.by Vazquez. ‘Since a copy of each statement was
furnished to Vazquez at his ‘request, it is quite possible that CAF

has surreptitiously obtained these copies from’ Vazquez. ‘Vazquez has

not been interviewed concerning the copies in his possession. pending -.
development of additional data and in view of information ‘from MM 635-S,

Memorandum to Mr, Belmont ;
RE: CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, ET AL.

is apparently entering into an excellent position not only to secure
the statements_in question but also, as assistant to the chief of
intelligence, CAF, to furnish extremely valuable information to the
FBI in the future, It is not believed that any action should be taken
at the present time which could possibly compromise MM 635-S,

This is for your information, We are continuing to follow this

matter very closely to bring it to a logical conclusion as quickly as
possible, :
