intercept transcripts. Mr. Watson stated that the file was very thin

place. Mr. Watson answered that it would not surprise him if Win
Scott had destroyed some files and pictures, He also stated that Scott
kept highly sensitive material which he did not want in the system in
a personal safe in his office. Mr. Watson stated that when Win Scott
retired he took the contents of the personal safe with him and stored
them in a safe in his home. When asked if the Oswald p-file he saw
had a note from Winston Scott that stated that nothing should be removed
as he was highly interested in it, Watson stated that it did not. He
said that a note Like that on a file would draw attention to it. "Every
one would want to read it." He said that he did not think it likely

' that Scott would put such a note ina file that was sensitive.

Stanley Watson stated that before Win Scott had been buried, James
Angleton flew to Mexico and emptied the personal safe in Scott's bedroom.
Mr. Watson said that he knew this from Scott's wife, Janet. When asked
if Angleton and Scott were close friends, Watson said,. “they were".
Watson stated that he thought the CIA Mexico City Station had given
all the material in their possession to the Warren Commission but that
he also knew that Win Scott was capable of "phoneying a photo if asked
to produce one. I never believed Win Scott the first time he told me
something." Watson also remembers Richard Helms congratualating Win
Scott for his excellent job on the Oswald trip to Mexico because "the
Agency had not looked all that bad."

Regarding Charles Thomas, Watson said, "He was rock solid; you can
rely on anything he said. He was sharp and perceptive. In fact I found
him to be way ahead of me many times." Watson said that he was responsible
for keeping Charles Thomas next to Elena Garro de Paz. Watson said

that Charles Thomas was skeptical of Elena's story at first. He does

remember if he later believed her but said that if he did then there mst
have been someting to her story.

Regarding Elena Garro de Paz, Watson stated that she was a neurotic
genius. "All the key people did not give her much credence." He stated
that Elena was not an intelligence agent. His last contact with Elena
Garro de Paz was in 1968. He thinks she left town around that time.
Watson stated that he thinks she left under "hurried" circumstances.

He also recalled that when Thomas left he (Watson) dropped all contact
with Elena. Finally, Watson stated that if the Company had helped Elena
depart he would not have necessarily known about it.

Watson stated that Cynthia Thomas was a troublemaker but that she
aided Charles and himself by introducing them to the intellectual crowd.

He apologized for not knowing more but stated that there was much
compartmentation in the Agency.

When asked if he had anything more to add to what he had told us,
he stated that it bothered him that the Agency had destroyed many P-files
when Win Scott retired.

Mr. Watson requested that we use his true name in any writeups.

The omnibus release letter was explained to Mr. Watson before the
interview started. He stated that he believed us and did not have to
see the letter. He was shown the letter at the end of the interview and
was asked if he wanted a copy for his. records. He stated that he had
read it and understood it and had been truthful in what he had told us
and that he did not want £6 copy of the letter lying around the house for

the maid to read.
