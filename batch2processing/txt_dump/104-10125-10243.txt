about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of

one storey
this property (a/Ssanish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSINE (check to
be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed vhen
the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the
-pucolic by the Warren Commission, The photo operators were moved to another apt
nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSIVE
for a long tern lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built
on this site). "-LILYRIC vas planned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED.
It was in an upper storey (3ra floor ~check) on the same side of the street
as LIMITED ‘but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of
the front gate of the Soviet Embassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both
Mexican families) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other,
LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALLA, the third photo site, was located
in one of a‘row of four houses on the South side of . the Soviet Enbassy compound
: which the Mexico Station purchased in about 1958 (check date), also using
“LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of
the Soviet Embassy compound. ‘The purpose of this operation ves to get good

(} (ey 8122 Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles
Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed &@ support apparatus to aR

 

 

 

exploit leads ‘from the Soviet Embassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)
consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

 

 

 

a. Fhone taps were placed by.
handled by yey WE (pseudo). The number of lines -

tapped was Linked by | by availability of a listening post nearby

 

(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/
Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, ete) transcribers. Generally
these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican Anerican) were related
(which the station at that time felt was good security in that

af they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b, Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help
“of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) end TDY TSD
people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment
devices, These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,
and LICALIA). LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across
the street from the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had
both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate'was on the
NorthVest corner.of their compound and LIMITED vas diagonally

when one of the surveillance agents got too close to his target and ,
