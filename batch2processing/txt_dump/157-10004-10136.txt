memos I had brought, “With regard to the accounting against
QUWIN/ZRRIFLE for some. of the activities he engaged in with
Roselli, he suggested that he always thought of ZRRIFLE as
the overarching crypt within which were the QJWIN operation
and the ZRRIFLE .° On expleration of executive action
He said that he used QJWIN/ZRRIFLE sometimes in connection
with the Roselli activities, but only after there had been
sono initial mixup by the finance section which resulted in
his general ZRRIELE activities and QJWIN operation being
slugged the same combined crypt of QUWIN/ZRRIFLE. With

regard to a note that refened coe

 

did not know why his name was on notes in the QJWIN
file, except that he was a highly talented narcotics expert
who worked both in the Justice Department and the CIA and
who might have been involved in the evaluating of or check-
ing on potential assets whom QJWIN had spotted in Italy.
(The file does reveal that QJWIN spotted assets in Italy.)

With regard to the small note in the file that simply

says "John Ralston —— John Roselli -- William Walker."
