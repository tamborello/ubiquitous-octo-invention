Informant also. advised that COLSTON had been in
Dallas, and about two weeks ago, was to have gone to Lake
Tahoe, Nevada, with informant's- wife. When his wife was
ready to leave, COLSTON could not be located and informant
has no idea where she might have gone or where she is currently
located. Informant stated he has removed himself from the
previous proposition in Oklahoma City wherein he and RITTER
were to go into partnership in a restaurant. He said RITTER

r wanted to put a poker game in the back room and informant said

he would not agree to this. Informant stated that, so far
as he knows, RITTER is going ahead on the restaurant deal alone.

On March 4, 1968, 2 advised
SA STEPHEN S. TRAVIS, Oklahoma City, that while pdaying bridge
at the Boomer Bridge Club in Oklahoma City, JACK RITTER told
him there was so much heat on pookmaking in Oklahoma City

and he had lost so much money in bad odds betting, that he
had closed his book for the present time.

On March 6, 1968, OC 548-PC advised that JACK RITTER

met FRANCES COLSTON in approximately. January, 1964, when

RITTER was working at. the Canadian Country Club, Canadian

County, Oklahoma. COLSTON eventually became RITTER"s mistress

and in 1965, RITTER began to hold weekly poker games in COLSTON 's
- apartment. Each. Monday night, RITTER and eight or ten others

would meet at this apartment and hold poker games which each

player had to "buy in' with at least $300.

Later the same year, RITTER and Oklahoma City

bookmaker , KENNETH ERY, were booking out’ of the Capitol

_Arms Apartments in'Oklahoma City.- In 1966,. RITTER's
mistress obtained a job as assistant manager of the Normandie
Apartments in Oklahoma City, and RITTER obtained an apartment
in that building and booked from it during the football
season. In 1967, RITTER again obtained an apartment at the
Normandie Apartments after booking in COLSTON's apartment
for three or four days.

Informant has seen RITTER accepting bets and
calling other local Oklahoma City bookies, but to informant's .
knowledge, RITTER has never made or accepted any out-of-state

telephone calls.. Informant has heard, RITTER and Dallas,

| Texas ,bookie, JOHNNY STONE, discuss another Dallas bookie,
i ; Tbs R. Dy THEWS ,..as ,being a close friend of Oklahoma.City
LEME. nooiaker , GEORG

BARNES . Informant feels RITTER does not

think very highly of MATHEWS judging from the way he talks
about MATHEWS. Informant has never known RITTER to

contact MATHEWS. RITTER told informant he intends.to, resume
bookmaking during the 1968 football season with BRUeELCOUCH,
Oklahoma City bookie, at the After Hours Club, Logan “Comty,
~oktanonay

On March 11, 1968, OC 549-PC advised SA HOWARD CECIL
that he was to play poker that night with RITTER and others:
at the apartment of JIM WEHBA, apartment 301, Belle Isle
Apartments, Oklahoma City.

Informant also stated RITTER lost a considerable
amount.of money booking during the past year and among
others, owes Qklahoma-City bookies KENNETHEEANERY and TRACY

, POE, as well as, Dallas, Texas bookie JOHN STONE.
: FA) ——— “

On March 15, 1968, OC 548-PC advised SA HOWARD
CECIL that RITTER's weekly poker game for the night of
March 11, 1968, was supposed to be held at the apartment of
JIM WEHBA at the Belle Isle apartments; however, WEHBA
had to go out of town and the game was changed to the apartment
of FRED MONSOUR at the Spanish Village Apartments, Oklahoma
City. Because.of the snow storm, RITTER and MONSOUR were
the only players who showed up. :

RITTER's.wife has gone to Hot Springs, Arkansas
for two weeks to attend the horse races. She goes there
each year where she meets with a man with whom she is having
an affair. RITTER is unaware of this. RITTER's wife is
reported to be a former prostitute.

RITTER obtained his football schedules during the past
football season from Oklahoma City bookie BRUCE COUCH. RITTER
then mailed the blank scheddles out to his bettors who had
to call RITTER for the "line". RITTER would meet with his
bettors on each Monday at the DeVille Motel to settle up.
RITTER had a poor season and is in bad financial shape.

On March 22, 1968, OC 548-PC advised SA HOWARD CECIL
that RITTER left at 10:30 A.M. that date for Wichita Falls,
Texas, to attend a bridge tournament. He intends to return
on March 25, 1968, in time to attend the weekly poker game
at JIM WEHBA's apartment located at the Belle Isle Apartments
in Oklahoma City.

 
 

This informant advised at 8:30 P.M. 6n.
1968, that RITTER and Oklahoma City bookmaker JO.
were en route to the poker game. WEHBA has changed apartments
and is now in apartment 114 at the Belle Ishe. apartments in
Oklahoma City. eC
