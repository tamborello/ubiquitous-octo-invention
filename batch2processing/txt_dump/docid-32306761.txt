it has been previously pointed cut that one of our |
primary goale in the Criminal Intelligence Program is the full
igentification and subsequent prosecution of the mombership
of-La Cosa Nostra (UCN), the dominant group in organized crime
inthis country. With an ever-increasing public awareness of the
significance of LCN on a national basis and in consideration of
; the Bureau's vast responsibilities in the field of organized
crime, it i6 necessary that complete intelligence be developed

; A veview of pregress reported in the identification
ef menbers of LON reveals that a substantial number have been
identified. Your office has reported that only five members of .
LCN veside in your division. This is an increase of only two
identifications within the past one-year period,

it is noted that the original information identifying .
these individuais as members wag not provided by sources of your
office. The basic make-up of LCN within your division has been
relatively undeveloped. :

As you know, SD 10G4-C-TE provided information in
October, 1967, revealing the existence of LCN groups in Pueblo
end Denver, Colorado.

There is an urgent need for your office to obtain
Sources who can reliably identify LCN membership in your
division. A <itrued picture with respect to the prevalence of
LCN in a particular area cannot be established without such
sources. To this end there must be a concentrated and an
imaginative effort by the Denver Office te penetrate LCN with
member-informants. The noteworthy achievements by many offices
in penetrating LCN clearly establish that a well-planned and

aggressive program will produce concrete results. nae Hiri | ny
