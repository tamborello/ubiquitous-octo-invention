On the morning of September 6, 1965, SAXON FARMER was
overheard to remark that ROBERT DEPUGH, the National Commander of

the "Minutemen" would not be coming to Bogalusa, Louisiana to speak

at the Klan rally to be held on September 6, 1965. FARMER aclaimed

that when the Federal Government found out that DEPUGH was supposed
to come to Bogalusa to speak , they had given DEPUGH some kind of
court order to appear in court.

FARMER remarked that Reverend FARRELL GRISWALD from
Montgomery, Alabama would be coming to Bogalusa to speak in place of

DEPUGH. FARMER stated that the Klan would pay all travel expenses

for the main speakers at this rally, who would be Judge JOHN RARRICK,

RICHARD COTTON and FARRELL GRISWALD.

There were observed in SAX FARMER's place of business a
Klan leaflet entitled "Fifty Reasons Why You Should Be a Member Of
The Ku Klux Klan."

At approximately 1:30 p.m. a motor parade of white indi-
viduals left the downtown area of Bogalusa and proceeded to the

Bogalusa Municipal Airport.
