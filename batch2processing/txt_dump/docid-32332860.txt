ORIGINAL COPY FILED INZQ — 2

After Mr, GOLDBERG became a CPA in the State of Maryland in
1932, he decided to engage in public practice of accounting
on a full time professional basis. At that time, the
economic situation in the country was poor and he found it
difficult to make a living. In about 1937, he developed
Mr, ROY MC GINNIS as a client. MC GINNIS operated a

music machine distributing business, and is currently in
the coin machine business under the name of Roy McGinnis
Corporation, Maryland Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, i

In about 1940, Mr. MC GINNIS took Mr. GOLDBERG to Pittsburgh,
_where he introduced him to SAM MANNARINO and his associates
who were in the same type of business. At the request of
SAM MANNARINO and some of his associates, he took them on
as clients and performed auditing and tax return services
for them. Through MANNARINO he became ‘associated with
SABESTIAN JOHN LAROCCA, MIKE GENOVESE and ANTHONY RIPEPI.
He also became acquainted with CHARLES J, MARGIOTTI, then
Attorney and political power in Pennsylvania who is now
deceased, Through MARGIOTTI he took over the accounting for
the Filben Corporation of Chicago, which was organized to
manufacture coin operated music machines, Although this

company has been defunct for a long time, Mr, GOLDBERG made
other contacts which resulted in developing clients, For
example, in Baltimore he acquired the account of the Cee Gee {
Music Company, which was organized by JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI and
LOUIS COMI, When the Filben Company ran into financial
agifficulties, it resulted in an investigation by the Internal
Revenue Service, and a great deal of newspaper publicity was
given to alleged irregularities in the operation of this
business, Mr. GOLDBERG had been placed in a compromising
position by officials of this company and realized at that
time that he had been taken advantage of by MARGIOTTI and his b
associates, He also realized that these men were engaging in :
questionable activities and felt that if he continued. his
association with them it could Jeopardize his standing as an 7
accountant. \

 

In about -1950, he decided “o discontinue his relationship
with MARGIOTTI and his associates, He wrote registered letters
to MARGIOTTI, GENOVESE, RIPEPI and others, advising them he
would no longer handle their accounting. At that time he would
have discontinued his association with LAROCCA, except for the
fact that he was then doing accounting for LAROCCA in connection
with some litigation involving most of LANDCCA's financial
interests, LAROCCA asked him to continue doing his accounting
y work at least until litigation was completed, Actually,
this situation has continued and LAROCCA has become further
indebted to him, so that at present, LAROCCA owes him a
considerable amount of money for accounting fees,

In the past several years; LAROCCA has entertained Mr,
GOLDBERG at his residence for dinner and to meet his family.
Therefore, in the latter part of 1957, when visiting with
LAROCCA, Mr. GOLDBERG invited him to attend the wedding of

‘his son, which was to be held at Philadelphia. In February,
1958, the wedding was held and LAFOCCA appeared accompanied
by ANTHONY RIPEPI. At this time, LAROCCA stated that his
wife was i11 and could not accompany him. Mr. GOLDBERG at
that time did not know that LAROCCA was wanted by the Govern-
ment or that there was any Federal Grand Jury Proceeding in
which LANOCCA was involved.

 

 

. He recalled that when he last visited with LAROCCA prior

/ te to the wedding, LAROCCA was having some trouble with his
throat, but at the wedding he did not notice any trouble in
this regard,

Mr, GOLDBERG emphatically stated that he has had no contact
with LAROCCA since the wedding in February, 1958, He ;
assured that if he has any contact with LAROCCA in the future
he will contact the FBI on a confidential basis, He stated
that he has every intention of cooperating fully with the :
Government concerning LAROCCA and concerning any matter in
which the Government may have an interest.

Mr, GOLDBERG stated that handling the accounting for coin i
machine operators and others close to this type of business to
has been a very small part of his accounting practice. He

!
stated that he still has some clients in this type of busi- r
ness, but to his knowledge none of them are numbers operators

or are engaged in illegal activities. : |

He stated that he continues to represent ROY MC GINNIS, but :
has no other similar type of account in Baltimore,

In the State of Maryland he handles the accounts of Andrews {
Vending Company, Glen Burnie, Maryland, which is operated

by ALBERT KULLEN and THOMAS ANDREWS. This company operates
various types of coin machines in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.
He also represents, in an accounting capacity, the General
Amusement Company, which is cperated by C, W, HENDRICKS,

Colonial Beach, Virginia, which also operates coin machines.
Both of these companies operate in counties where certain
forms of gambling are permitted through use of coin machines,

Concerning LOUIS COMI, who is currently one of the top
hoodlums in the Baltimore Division,. Mr. GOLDBERG stated that
he has had very little contact with COMI personally. He
advised that ROSE COMI handled most of the dealings for Cee
Gee Machine Company, which has been inactive for about five
years.

Mr, GOLDBERG recalled meeting JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI, who has been
identified as a former Pittsburgh racketeer currently operating
a night club in Dundalk, Maryland,

In the course of this interview, Mr. GOLDBERG requested that
his identity be concealed in reporting any information
furnished by him. He assured of his desire to cooperate
