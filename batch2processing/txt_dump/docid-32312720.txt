WLL/rew ; SECR :

This report is being classified confidential in
order to protect the identity of the informants of continuing
value used therein and whose identity, if made known, could
be prejudicial to the national defense interests.

 

The deposit of $417.81 on 11/5/63, was reviewed by
SA LITTLE and it was noted that the deposit was made up of
“numerous personal checks in small amounts - apparently in
response to the appeal in the 10/21/63, BAFPCC newsletter for
funds to aid the hurricane victims in Cuba.

The details of this report do not contain the
information furnished 5/9/63, by NY 2440-S* concerning the
allegation made by VINCENT THEODORE LEE to TOM LEONARD in
Denver that ASHER HARER skimmed five thousand dollars from the
BAFPCC Film project and gave it to the SWP, This information
is not being reported due to the complete coverage that was given
to the BAFPCC film project, which was appropriately reported and
indicated no malfeasance on the part of HARER, or anyone else,
in the handling of these funds. .
