peport. on the trip of Admiral Perry to the

“planning to take over North Viet Nam and

probably will not be satisfied to divide the
country..as they did in Korea. He said that
if the United States and South Viet Nam
invade North VietNam, a third world war
may start, and that Russia, in spite of her
difficulties. with China, will support China
and North Viet Nam in a war against the
United States. He said that he doubted if

. France would support the United States as
France wants to neutralize South Viet Nam.
