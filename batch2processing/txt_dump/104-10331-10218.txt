RE: Torricelli Request

ce: John Pereira

The JFK collection contains a number of documents on Gilberto Policarpo Lopez including a
small 201 file (14 pages). I have attached two documents that summarize the material on him in the
collection. I did not locate any information on Lopez’s activities in Havana or his current whereabouts.
The most recent references in the collection are from 1977-79 and deal with HSCA’s investigation.

There are numerous references to Joaquin Hernandez Armas, Cuban Ambassador to Mexico in
1963, in the JFK collection. Most of the documents deal with a telephone conversation between the
President of Cuba ( Dorticos) and the Ambassador a few days after the assassination of JFK. I found no
information in the collection on when Hernandez Armas was recalled or subsequent positions held.
According to one document, he was still in Mexico City in June 1965.

Dear Admiral Studeman:

I am writing to request information related to the assassination of
President Kennedy.

First, I would like to know the whereabouts of Mr. Gilberto Lopez.
Until November, 1963, Mr. Lopez had been living in Tampa, Florida.
On November 23, 1963 Mr. Lopez entered Mexico from Nuevo Laredo,
Texas, and on November 27 he boarded a Cubana Airlines flight from
Mexico City to Havana, Cuba. I would like to know what happened to
him after he arrived in Havana.

Second, I would like to know what happened to the Cuban Ambassador
to Mexico City at the time of the Kennedy assassination. When was
he recalled to Havana and what positions has he held subsequent to
his recall?

Thank you for you attention to this matter. I look forward to
hearing from you soon.
