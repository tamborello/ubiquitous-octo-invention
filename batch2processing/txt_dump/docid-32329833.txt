told JENNINGS something to the effect that he should tell
WARD to take care of his debts or he "would have a visitor."
As a result of this call, WARD is fearful that something will
happen to him someday.

WARD claims he still cannot pay the $5,000 debt
because of other pressing debts, including one to the
Internal Revenue Service. This information has been furnished
to the Las Vegas Division. “

LEROY DALE HINES, aka, IGA, BuFile 162-1073

JACK RITTER, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, formerly an
informant of this office, and subject of Oklahoma City file

35 years. He admitted that during the football season of 1965
he received his line and football cards from LEROY DALE HINES,
Tulsa, Oklahoma. He said that HINES sent the cards and line
sheets to him every week via bus, and that he picked them up
in an envelope at the Oklahoma City bus station.

Occasionally, when HINES was in Oklahoma City for
gambling or other reasons, he would leave the cards and
line sheets with the barmaid at the Thunderbird Inn, Oklahoma
City, where he would pick them up in. person. He said he
called HINES on a weekly basis in order to get the line.

He said that LOUIS BOND EGBERT, an employee of HINES, usually
answered the phone and gave him the line.
