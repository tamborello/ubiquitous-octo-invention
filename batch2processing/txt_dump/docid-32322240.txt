Title: JOHN F. KENNEDY RECORDS COLLECTION
ACT OF 1992 (THE ACT)

Synopsis: Kansas City was requested to forward serials to JFK
Task Force.

Enclosures: Enclosed for FBIHQ are 13 original serials.

OC ; Details: The enclosed thirteen serials were located on a special

oN search among the numerous volumes of file 92-116. The enclosed
original serials were filed with the enclosed charge out dating
back to May of 1966.

 

The majority of the original serials of 92-116 SubA
were charged out to FBIHQ on May 9, 1966. Copies of these were
made and retained by Kansas City. However, for an unknown
reason, a new 92-116 Sub A file was created for the duplicates.
As a result, two 92-116 Sub A files were in the Kansas City
Office: one with the forwarded copies; the other with the

retained originals. G1¥- WY \ 015 LY S~ rt} 1 ay

The file containing the copied serials was correctly
placed in numerical order in closed files. Unfortunately, as the
file containing the few retained originals was extremely thin, it
was misfiled in another volume of the file. As a result, when
the initial searches for the missing serials were conducted, the
file containing the copied serials was quickly located, leading
to the assumption that Kansas City no longer had the missing
original serials. Only through the instant complete and
exhaustive search of the entire file were the misplaced original
serials located.
