Subject: SSC Request to Breckinridge During his 2 June Appearance,
for Files and Materials relating to the 1967 IG Report on
Assassinations, Including Tab A after Page 77 of the Report.

’ Response: :
A search has been made for the files of the Chief, WH
Division in 1967 (Desmond Fitzgerald), and those of Col.
J. C. King. At that time Mr. Fitzgerald was alive; he
has since died and his files do not exist as an integral
collection, although portions may exist in different
holdings in WH Division, Col, King had retired at, the
time of the IG inquiry, but he was still working under a
special contract and was at the Headquarters Building
at Langley where he had retained some personal files;
his files are no longer identifiable.

Other materials, reviewed by the Inspectors in 1967 were
limited in nature, some of which have been made available
to SSC Staff members in envelopes in which they have been
held since 1967. The SSC Staff members have had access
to the project files of QJIWIN, _WIROGUE, ZRRIFLE and
EMDEED. |

21 July 1975

Subject: CIA Intercession in Behalf of Robert Maheu and/or
Salvatore Giancana and/or John Roselli in Relation to
Possible Prosecutions Other than 1962 Las Vegas
Bugging Incident--Requested of Mr. Breckinridge
During Appéarance Before SSC on 2 June.

Response: . :

A review of Agency files reveal one instance, in
addition to the 1962 intercession in connection with
the Las Vegas bugging incident, in which CIA
representatives approached law enforcement
authorities with reference to pending prosecution
against any of the above persons. .

Records show that on 26 February 1971 the
Comnissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service
Department of Justice, was approached concerning
action reportedly being initiated for the
deportation of John Roselli. The purpose of this was
to forestall public disclosure of Roselli’s past

operational association with CIA. It was agreed that
CIA would be kept informed of the progress of all
action. No further commitments were made.
