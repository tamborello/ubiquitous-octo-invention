MM 2-312

: On March 1, 1962, DAMON SHELTON NAPIER, in- \
tervlewed at the Mobile, Alabama, County Jail, advised _
that about two weeks previously, he received a long dis-'
tance telephone call placed from California by ABBOTT,
wherein ABBOTT indicated he was going to visit Mobile,
Alabama, and would contact him. NAPIER said ABBOTT ar-
rived in Mobile about February 20, 1962, and was
accompanied by GERALD PATRICK HEMMING , whom he, NAPIER,
had also met while in Miami about a year ago. NAPIER
said ABBOTT and HEMMING registered at the Palms Motel
on Highway 90, Mobile, and ABBOTT was driving a 1960
blue and white, four-door. Mercury automobile, bearing
California tags, NAPIER said it was his impression
that HEMMING came from California with ABBOTT; however,
he did ‘not know if HEMMING knew this automobile was
stolen or if HEMMING received any of the proceeds from
its sale.

, On March 1, 1962, HEMMING was located at the
Greyhound Bus Depot, Mobile, Alabama, where he stated he
had been released from the Mobile, Alabama, City Jail

. that day after his case was nolle prossed. HEMMING still
maintained he hitchhiked from California to Mobile; he was
not acquainted with anyone named ABBOTT; and, could not
recall any information concerning a 1960 Mercury automobile
or concerning any checks passed at the Springdale Plaza.
HEMMING said he was leaving by bus that day, intending to
go to Miami, where he would again be active with the Cuban
movement.
