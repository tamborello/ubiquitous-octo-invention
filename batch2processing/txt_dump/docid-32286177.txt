17. Remarks (By SAC):

It is recommended that this surveillance be maintained for an
additional period of ninety days ill be done UACB...
Obviously the quality and quantity of information received from
this source has decreased from its peak three years ago, however,
as is set out in number 9 it can be seen that information of
interest to the investigations of this office continues to be
obtained through this source. In addition, it is pointed out that
there is no expense involved in monitoring this source for the '
reason that the same employees who monitor other surveillances
on the same subject easily and with a minimum of effort monitor i
this source. It is further, pointed out that there does not appear |
{

to be any risk involving the security of this source, except that
risk which would hecessarily be attained in any operation
involving an entry to retrieve the microphone.
