In regard to training of personnel of the organization, Source stated
thet there was a Spscisi Forces Captain by the name of Carl Hickey who was
slated to assist in the training of the persoanel. Hickey is in a reserve unit
in the Miami area, exact location unrecalled, however, Hickey has called Source
at least twice since Source has been in the hospital with questions as to when .
he can get started. Additionally, Hickey has mentioned that he would Like to
go on a "fishing trip" near Cuba; however, Source and SUBJECT have discouraged
this since it would “blot:" the entire operation if an émerican military type
were caught and would also bring discredit on the US Covernment. Cther than
Hickey, there are two people in Hickey's unit who are also willing to assist
and have made their desires knew. Source gave the names as follows:

QHISCELLANEGUS) On 17 June 1970, Hanuel NO% AGUILAR was interviewed at
the Miami Pield Office, Region I11, llth MI Group, Milani, Florida, regarding
informtion HE volunteered concerning an anti-Castro Cuban exile group called
Frente Revolucionarfa Anti-Ccmmunista en Cuba (FRACC) (Anti-Communist Revolu-
tionary Front in Cuba), of which He claimed to be a leader. AGUILAR, & jeweler
employed by Kappy's Jewelry Store, 1423 Washington Avenue, Miami Beach, Florida,
who resides at 453 SW LOth Street, Miami, stated in substance as follows:

 
   
       
     
   
 

B In approximately 1959, SUBJECT helped form FRACG in Cuba when it becane
known that the Castro regime was turning Communist. SUBJECT claimed that at
[that time HE was a member of Castro's Naval Intelligence. HE alleged that HE
attempted to obtain help from the American Embassy, but the only help HE re-
ceived vas from a COL Samuel Louis Bouque (phonetic), then the US Military At-
tache, who rade personal donations to FRACC but offered no official help. When
SUBJECT could not obtain official aid, HE and the other members of FRACC went =“
underground. Souzce declined to reveal the names of other persons in FRACC for
fear of jeopardizing their security since some members were still in prison in |.
Cuba. In approximately March 1962, SU3JECT escaped from Cuba when HE learned ef -
that HE was beine investigated for subversive activities. Since coning to the i
US, HE has been working with about 50 persons living in various parts of the US
in order to send aid to members of FRACC in Cuba. SUBJECT declined to reveal
the names of these members in the US. As yet, FRACC has only been able to send
very small amounts of afd to FRACC at sporadic intervals and through clandes-
tine means. They do not have any stockpiles of arms or material and do not
plan to initiate any action without the approval of the US Government. There
is no forcal organization of FRACC in the US; however, SUBJECT claimed that
the FRACC mecbers in the US could be organized and trained in-a matter of four
or five weeks to send supplies and arms to Cuba. SUBJECT believed that there
were approximately 4,000 to 10,000 persons in Cuba who would support FRACC Iim-
mediately if they had assurance that FRACC did, in fact, have supplies and the
support of the US. SUBJECT claimed that HE was in contact with members of FRACC
-|in Cuba (some still in prison and others in high positions within the Cuban
juilictary), NFI, who were awaiting support. SUBJECT had no definite military
jplans but believed that FRACC could overthrow the Castro regime from within,
rather than by means of an invasion involving the US, if they had the proper
supplies and support. SU3JECT was referred to the Miami Field Office by Roy
Hargrave, presently a patient at Palm Springs General Hospital, 1475 W 49th
Street, Hialeah, Florida, Through Hargrave, SUBJECT met an individual whe
claimed to be a Captain .n the US Army Reserves, not further identified, who
stated that he eéuld train SUBJECT and the other members of FRACC.

Source became interested in becoming a mercenary in 1961. He later
cane to Miami and was able to gradually work himself into the ranks of volun-
teer mercenaries within the area who wanted to go to Cuba to assist in the
overthrow of the Castro regime. Hargraves met Gerald Patrick Hemming, whose
present address is 2668 Santa Anita Avenue, El Monte, California, telephone

442-3641. Wemning, referred to by Source as “Jerry”, is presently the presi-
dent of a Los Angeles Ironworker's Union but was, at the time, working for a
private patrol agency or investigative agency out of Rosecead, California.

The ower of the agency pas FU Moses. Jerry was the organizing force behind
the volunteer military screctures from 1962 to 1964. While working for Hering,
Sou ;ce met Felipe Vidal-Sentiag , who had been the Chief of Maritime Police
under Castro and later became ¢ 2 Military Attache to Colunbia, South America.
Santf yo defected to the US in* 360. It was through Santiago, in 1961, that
Sourcé met ‘SU3JECT who is also own as "Minola". Acccrding to Santiago,
SUBJECT could be trusted, was 1. “vel headed but was apt to disobey orders when
HE fet that there was sorething’ more important to do, Santiago related that
SUBJEC: had worked for Raul Castro's right-hand man, a seven-foot Negro named
Hectc, Aldawas. Following Santiago's defection to the US in 1960, he re-
peatedly sent money and supplies into Cuba by way of SUBJECT. SUBJECT was the
con’ 3: zt man and was sending out reports, but suddenly, without warning, HE

lef / the island and came to the US in 1961. HE was not knowa to lie about any
mathers, but Santiago believed HIS reports te be somewhat exaggerated.

[that the people who worked for HIM then are now some of the top officials in
‘Tthe Castro administration.

SUBJECT approached Source approximately four days ago (15 June 1970)

people in order to obtain US support. HE related to Source that HE was williag
to obtain certain items from within Cuba in order to prove HIS vorth and abili-
ty. HZ proposed to have some of the top officials defect to the US; the defec~
tion of the majority of a crew, to include the Captain, of a new KOMAR patrol
boat; aud the obtainment of the newest jet aircraft supplied to Cuba by the
Seviet Union. In return SUBJECT wanted a guarantee that the persons coming out
of Cuba would be free to remain active against Castro, as opposed to being sent
into exile somewhere in the US. Additionally, SUBJECT wanted to retain the
+PROMAR for action against Cuba or be supplied with a vessel of similar features
with which to operate. SUSJECT related that HE already has an island chosen to
use as a base of operations, however, Source could not supply the name or loca=
tion of the island. SUBJECT retains a strong feeling that if the people who
defect to the US, during this demonstration of ability, are left to operate
against Castro, then the people inside Cuba will rapidly join the movement.
The defection of the KOMAR patrol boat, as well as the jet aireraft, can be
accomplished in a matter cf a few veeks, SUBJECT is sinply waiting for the
“green Light" from someone in a high position.

As an additional requirement SUBJECT stated that following RIS suc-
cessful procureccnt of material and people, HE wanted x guaranteed pipeline of
supplies and equipment from HIS base of operations to the guerilla units operat-
ing inside Cuba. Proposed methods of infiltrating the material into Cuba were
described as beach landings, which would be simplified by the face that SUBJECT
has access to the patrol schedules of Cuban and Russian vessels operating
around the Cuban mainland. Additionally, SUBJECT presently has people of the
organization pofsed to sabotage radar installations along the Cuban coastline.

In reference to the organization, allegedly active within Cuba as
{well as the US, and under the explicit control of SUBJECT, Source mentioned
that “cells were organized throughout Cuba as well as dispersed in the US.
SUBJECT has maintained contact with all of the cell leaders by an unknown
method. Names of the members could not be furnished; however, Source stated
that .he visited SUBJECT unannounced and met two individuals whose nanes he
‘Jeould not recall, however, he believed them to be members of Alpha 66.
Source questioned SUBJECT concerning the men and Alpha 66, and SUBJECT stated
that HE would not include them in any activity or proposed plans because HE
knew that plans of Alpha 66, once formulated, were common knowledge in Cuba.
hours after the plans are conceived, Source believed the name of one of the
individuals was Minola Pcy. Source also believed that SUBJECT'S organization
had a training atea in the Dominican Republic.
