FROM CHICA 3P .

   

SAMUEL M. GIARCAWA, AKA. AR. 00 CHICAGO.

AS BUREAU AWARE, GIANCANA HAS FAILED TO TAKE AN ACTIVE
ROLE IN LEADERSHIP OF ORGANIZED CRIME HERE SINCE TIME HE
COMMENCED HIS ONE YEAR INCARCERATION, JUNE, SIXTY FIVE. AT ~~ Y
PRESENT TIME, CHICAGO SOURCES GENERALLY REPORT THAT GIANCANA
APPARENTLY HAS NOW RETURNED TO CHICAGO AREA. HOWEVER,

GIANCANA HAS NOT BEEN OBSERVED AT ANY OF HIS KNOWN HANGOUTS
AND APPARENTLY IS MAKING NO EFFORT THIS TIME TO RESUME STRONG
LEADERSHIP ROLE. {v)

BECAUSE OF GIANCANA'S INCARCERATION AND HIS SUBSEQUENT
ABSENCE THERE HAS BEEN NO STRONG LEADERSHIP OF THE CHICAGO
CRIMINAL GROUP. THIS HAS CAUSED FACTIONAL DISPUTES AND
DISSATISFACTION AMONG VARIOUS HOODLUM GROUPS MOST NOTABLE
OF WHICH IS OBVIOUS WIDENING RIFT BETWEEN FIORE BUCCIERI GROUP
AND FRANK LA PORTE GROUP. (v)
