(Miami File 62-3398~20)

In connection with the Miami GIIF, CHARLES A. WILLIAMS ,
a detective of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, furn-
H ished the following information:

; Late in 1952 WILLIAMS was checking on the whereabouts

of PETER JULIAN ARNSTEIN, a known jewel thief. He called at
the apartment house owned by ARNSTEIN, the Ocean Creek Apart-

ments, 5980 Indian Creek Drive, Miami Beach, under the pretext

of wanting to rent an apartment. OLLIE ARNSTEIN, a well-known

madam from Chicago, came to the door. and permitted WILLIAMS

- to walk through their apartment in order to get to a boat dock

y at the rear of the building where the Manager was then located.

: As he passed through the apartment WILLIAMS observed PETE ARN-

STEIN to duck into the kitchen. He noticed that there was
some sort of a meeting of ten men going on in the living room.

s Subsequent thereto, WILLIAMS went to the Miami Beach PD and

examined a number of photographs. He identified the photographs

i . of PAUL LABRIOLA, FBI Number 1153214; EDWARD VOGEL, FBI Number

{ 4329702; and, ROBERT BENNETT as definitely being present at

- the above meeting. LABRIOLA and. VOGEL are well-known Chicago

criminals and BENNETT is the chauffeur for Miami Beach City

Councilman MARCIE LIEBERMAN. WILLIAMS also is of the belief

i that DAVE YARAS was present at this meeting, but could not be

5 absolutely positive of his identification. It is not improb-

: able that YARAS was there as it has come to the attention of

' the Miami Office that he is an associate of ARNSTEIN. Although
YARAS spends considerable time in Havana, Cuba, he still main-

tains his residence at 4410 Adams Avenue, Miami Beach.

 

i JOE THURMAN, Investigator, I & NS, Miami, advised
4 ; that he interviewed DAVE YARAS on November’6, 1952, to deter-
o mine if he was a citizen, and at that time YARAS advised him
that he still had a financial interest in the Tahiti Bar lo-
cated at 224 - 23rd Street, Miami Beach, whi is licensed in
