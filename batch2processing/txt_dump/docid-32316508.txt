_ On November 20, 1964, NK T-2 advised .that..he
had been fired by his employer in November, 1964, for al-
‘legedly drinking on the job,. NK T-2 denied the charge
and the matter is now in. arbitration, :

NK 7-2 ‘stated that he. went to PROVENZANO in an
attempt to get his job back and PROVENZANO, in no uncertain
terms, told him he would not help him. © Shortly thereafter

-. om November 19, 1964, the informant received an anonymous
_. telephone call’ offering to help him keep his case out of
arbitration and get him his job back for $50.00. The unknown
individual attempted to set up a meet to.which the informant
was to come alone, NK T-2 felt that this was an attempt to.
get him alone and work ‘him over because of. his 8 dispute with
- PROVENZANO. . .

Informant stated that PROVENZANO has lost. con-
siderable weight and complains that he is suffering from
sclerosis of-the liver, . According to the informant, the
rank and file feeling in Local 560 is that if. PROVENZANO’s
appeal is denied by the United States Suprome Court and he -
thereafter goes to jail he will be succeeded by SALVATORE
- BRIGUGLIO, a Business Agent for Local 560, rather than by .
his brother, SALVATORE PROVENZANO, aka, Sammy, who has, until
_ this time, been considered his logical successor. ——.

. On: December 14; 1964, NK T-2 advised that: PROVENZANO
recently ‘held a meeting of his shop stewards and proposed ~
that the terms of the elected officers of the local be
- increased from two. to three years. . Informant stated that.no
official notice of this has been given to the rank and file :

of the local and as a matter of fact PROVENZANO has apparently

_. Suspended the regular membership meetings and they will,

‘ hereafter, be held only when he desires to -have them.

On December 8,. 1964, NK 7-3 advised: that he con-
tinues ‘to meet with PROVENZANO on certain union affairs at
regular intervals, “PROVENZANO is obvieusly concerned about
his case which. is before the Supreme Court and does not -
appear to be a well man physically, It is the informant's

opinion that PROVENZANO will do nothing in his union. or
personal activities which ‘might endanger this Appeal.”

. “In the opposition. faction in Local 560, at is noted ”
they are becoming more powerful and more vocal and ‘there is
apparently the general feeling that they could beat: PROVENZANO

an honest: election if their civil suit challenging the.
