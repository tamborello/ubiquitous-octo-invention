fi The Bundeskriminalamt (BKA - West German

 

Federal Criminal Police) has furnished the following
information which originated with the Police of Fuersten-
feldbruck, Federal Republic of Germany (FRG).

No information has been developed that the subject
or his wife has visited in Fuerstenfeldbruck since the summer
of 1969, Inquiries have indicated that the subject's mother-
in-law, Mrs. FUEGER, does not expect a visit from the subject
and his wife. This is primarily true because the mother-
in-law only returned from the United States about three weeks
ago having spent the major part of the past winter with her
daughter, Inquiries in the vicinity of the address #12 Martha-
braeustrasse, Fuerstenfeldbruck, developed that the caretaker
of the apartments at that address has not seen the subject
recently.
