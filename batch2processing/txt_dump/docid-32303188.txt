On 12/18/61, PG 615-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III
as follows:

In his opinion, the raid at the Mannarino gambling casino -
horse room in New Kensington, Pa., on August 24, 1961, by IRS,
Pittsburgh, was ill-advised, shortsighted and poorly Planned.

 £2IIY-PYD

For two years, PG 615-C has been attempting to obtain wnereasiney
better information about the Mannarinos, their illegal., .
activities, their associates and their future plans. He

has done this without any thought of, or desire for monetary
compensation, simply because of his firm conviction that

the MANNARINO "“strangle-hold" on all phases.of life and
activity in the New Kensington area. had to be broken.

In spite of the. obvious: dangers to his professional reputation

"somebody else.

By frequenting gambling establishments, PG 615-c met many
of the MANNARINO employees, and by performing small: favors
for them, professional and otherwise, he became friendly
with most of them and the confidant of. some of them.
They furnished considerable information, some more valuable
than others, but a compendium of their bits of information
was forming a gradually clearing picture of the entire
MANNARINO operation,

On 12/19/61, PG 612-C, who is an experienced numbers writer
inthe’ MANNARINO operationinaNew Kensington, was asked about
the dearth of pertinent information being woceived, 4 and
informant advined: , :

The town: (New. Kefisington) has been cihosed down almost

- completely, as regards. gambling, sinée the "Federal raid

- last summer“ and since the-commencement of the FGJ: inquiry.
Besides ‘the numbers racket, which is down in. volume by at
least half, there are only three card games in the city,
only..one of which is operating. on any given night. © Horse
bets, sports bets: and dice games have. been: eliminated,
allegedly by orders of ‘the MANNARINOS,.- Men who. have’ been

' for years employed in.one. phase or another of the MANNARINO
gambling set-ups are.’now: ‘Loafing. about: ‘town , - and their
principal topics of- discussion concern the FGJ hearings,
their :belief that: the newly-elected reform administration

in: New Kensington . will not allow resumption of open gambling,
and their "fears" concerning their own futures. With

regard: to: the numbers -racket, elaborate security. measures
have been put into effect, and only ‘those possessing the
Federal Wagering Tax ‘Stampsare permitted to-participate.

In ‘view. of these facts, pertinent ‘information has been scarce
and unreliable. .

¥

f.

spot - gurvet ances: at. residences: legitimate business sites

~ - and at. known ‘hangouts’ during: the past four’ months have been
wholly unproductive-and tend to. substantiate: the comments of
the above. mentioned informants.

Due to the situation created. by the - -IRS- raid on August 24,

1961; and the resultant PGI probe, as. it affects receipt

‘by the’ Pittsburgh Office. of positive. information concerning

the’ MANNARINOS: and: their activities, the Pittsburgh office

has found it? impossible to comply fully with Bureau instructions
‘concerning submission of :a daily teletype summary: of pertinent
developmen te. a,

As matters now stand,.the only readily discernible method
of. collecting: current positive information concerning either
MANNARINO is by establishing highly confidential sources.

In View of the above, PCI Leechburg,

Pa., GABRIEL MANNARINO's on 12/18/61,
by $A FORSYTH, and PcI[_ ]was asked why he had furnished
80 little information in recent months. PCI advis edt

Prior to the"Federal raid on the MANNARINO genbling joint |
in New Kensington towards the end of summer," 1961, he
observed some activity around GABRIEL MANNARINO's cottage
near Leechburg. While there were never any groups of visitors,
except.for one family-type outdoor picnic, occasionally
individuals would visit the cottage.. Also, GABRIEL
MANNARINO .was observed to leave the house almost daily at
varying hours. Since "the raid," GABRIEL MANNARINO
has developed what amounts almost: to a predictable pattern.
He leaves the cottage on most days shortly before noon,
always ‘alone, and he returns to stay at about eight: o'clock
! in the evening. Visitors are extremely rare and never stay
OTHER 4 more than a few minutes. PCI has not been able to obtain
any information of recognizable pertinence and, therefore,,.
has not.contacted SA FORSYTH. .

on 12/18/61, ver[ 7 Pittsburgh, Pa.,
employed as Manager 0 eM ARINO-owned Ken Iron and
Steel Co., New Kensington, was. asked by SA PORSYTH why he

has not been furnishing and pertinent information during
the recent past; and he advised:

 

Even before the "Government raid". in:New Kensington in |
August 1961, he was not taken into the confidence of the
“MANNARINOS as.regards anything but their. scrap metals and
_.. a8 well businesses. They put him in charge of these two
. ventures because of his education and prior experience.
‘ .. However, on occasion he overheard conversations involving
( some of their other interests and observed them meet some
rv of their associates and/or employees. Since the raid, he
{ has. not seén GABRIEL MANNARINO more than three times and,
understands that GABRIEL’ MANNARINO is spending most of his
time at his cottage near Leechburg, Pa., while SAM MANNARINO
spends the largest portion of each day at his restaurant,
The Bonfire, “located a few miles from Leechburg." From |
what he has been able to observe ; and learn, SAM MANNARINO
and GABRIEL MANNARINO‘ see very little of each other or of
their erstwhile associates. .PCI does.not feel that he can
probe for information from either MANNARINO without arousing
their suspicions, because it has been his habit to Obaerve
and. listen but not. to ask questions;
