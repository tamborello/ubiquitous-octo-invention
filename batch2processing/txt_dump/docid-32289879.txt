With regard to the requested interview of HELMUTAYATER and
ELROSE FUEGER in Munich, Germany, the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA - West
German Federal Criminal Police) advised that the Munich, Germany, police
had contacted MAIER, whose full name is HELMUT FRIEDRICH LE (ATER, on
4-13-62 and attempted to elicit information from him with re ard to the ,
subject and in line with the suggestions in referenced letter. ~ MAIER
said that he was then employed by the export firm of Messrs. Linde and
that his employers intended to send him to the United States in the i
future to represent them there. As a result he declined to furnish any :
information in this matter on the basis that he desired to protect himself ‘ i
from possible future retaliations against him. He said that he would 4
only furnish positive information if he was given a guarantee that \
nothing of what he said would ever become known to those regarding whom \

he might be willing to report, adding that he felt that this condition i
could not be guaranteed if Chicago police authorities became aware of any | :
information he might provide. MAIER wanted the Munich police to advise
what police authority was interested in the investigation and to be
informed in detail of what security measures would be offered him in ‘
the United States. : \

The BKA informed that MAIER, who was born 5-18-29 in Munich, /
Germany , was residing at 200 Saebenerstrasse, c/o Haeus ea

that the information desired was for the use of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in the United States and, if he so desired, his identity _

held in confidence by the Bureau; however, neither the police nor the Bureau
