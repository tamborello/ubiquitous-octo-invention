allegations concerning HENRY GOODMAN's flying activities.
From the memorandum it could not be determined whether this
letter was being forwarded by the USDS to its Miami Office,

\or vice versa; however, there was no copy of this letter in .
) the file.

This memorandum also makes reference to a report
of the Miami Office of the USDS dated 7/27/60, captioned
"B-25 N8090H—Exportation to Argentina". It was not con-
tained in this file. In addition, this memorandum indicated
that the Federal Aviation Agency, Miami, is presently processing
violations against HENRY GOODMAN and his B-25 which violations
apparently are for infractions of civil air regulations. . z

This file contains no additional information con:
cerning HENRY GOODMAN.

It is noted that HAROLD SUGARMAN, referred to above,
is apparently identical with the SUGARMAN who accompanied the
subject on subject's B-25 Janding.in Cuba which information

|vas set forth in referenced WFO letter. ‘ .

On 4/11/68, records of the Passport Office, USDS, -
were reviewed by.SA ROBERT M. EGAN. These records indicated

When they returned to Miami, LESSLIE and GOODMAN
said SUGARMAN was giving them "too much static." They
refused to let him go along on the next trip. When SUGARMAN
told them to give him his money back, they said he had his
"stock" which he had purchased.

SUGARMAN summarized the following items, stating
that GOODMAN was a menace on or off the airways: (1) flying
at night without lights; (2) doing heavy maintenance himself;
(3) knowingly flying in restricted areas; (4) hauling cargo
commercially in a noncertified aircraft; (5) hauling passengers
for hire in a restricted aircraft; (6) using an aircraft to
bring liquor into the country without declaring it to Customs
and paying duty on it.

SUGARMAN advised the aircraft registration was
NS 3482 G and stated GOODMAN's address was 7840 S. W. 125th
Avenue, Miami.

Attempts were made to locate and contact WALTER H.
LESSLEY, above, with negative results.

On 7/26/68, LEONARD H.: THORNTON, Counselor, FAA,
Miami, advised that GOODMAN had come to his attention approx- -.
imately one year ago in connection with a possible violation
of FAA rules concerning his operational certificate for
piloting a B-25 airplane. GOODMAN's certificate permits him
to carry his own goods but he may not haul freight for other
people. However, it was determined through GOODMAN's attorney
that GOODMAN owned the goods he was hauling in connection
(with the complaint that had been received by that agency
against GOODMAN. Nothing came of the matter.

d. Subject has no local arrest record. He has a
favorable credit record. An FD-9 submitted 1/30/68

reflected that on the basis of information furnished (date

and place of birth, description and Air Force serial numbers),

the Identification Division was unable to identify GOODMAN

in either the criminal or civil files.

and approached “SUGARMAN as a potential buyer of:-an interest

in their company, United Americas Import-Export Corporation.
They suggested that SUGARMAN could get multi-engine commercial
and instrument ratings on the B-25. GOODMAN said that. with
his instruction, SUGARMAN would be able to co-pilot the
aircraft and be an active partner. They mentioned huge
profits they were making in buying, selling and transporting
tropical fish, animals and plants. SUGARMAN paid them

$4,200 for a 10 per cent interest in the firm.

On 12/30/59, LESSLIE was doing maintenance on an
aircraft and later with SUGARMAN loaded eight 50-gallon drums
of fuel in the bomb bay compartment, which LESSLIE said was
to be used on the return trip because it Was cheaper than
buying fuel in Iquitos, Peru, their destination. Several. .
refrigerators were loaded aboard, which LESSLIE said had

:been sold in advance of the trip. LESSLIE said this was

ie

legal.

That evening, a Swedish fellow joined SUGARMAN
and GOODMAN on the trip.. The Swedish fellow told SUGARMAN
that he had agreed to supply GOODMAN with orchid plants in
several weeks for immediate transportation. When the plane
took off, it began an unusual vibration. GOODMAN took a
flashlight and saw the wind pulling the cowling open because
of loose Zeus fasteners. GOODMAN got clearance to land and
later berated LESSLIE for his carelessness in maintenance.
The cowling was fastened by. LESSLIE and the plane again took
off.

When they were airborne, GOODMAN gave the controls
to SUGARMAN to hold. Later, he turned the navigation lights
and the beacon off, stating they would be over Cuba in a
few minutes and the State Department forbid flying over
Cuba. Therefore, they would go with the lights off. This
conserved fuel, according to GOODMAN.

In a little while, they were over land, at which
time GOODMAN called Havana and gave their position as west
of Cuba when actually they were east of Havana,

When they landed in Panama, GOODMAN gave ‘SUGARMAN
money to purchase liquor and-told him to be sure to get the
crew discount. The liquor was later delivered to the
ramp, along with some liquor which GOODMAN, himself, had
purchased, ~

After unloading the fuel in Iquitos, Peru, and
prior to loading the cargo, GOODMAN placed this liquor in
the lower front portion of the bomb bay compartment. Cargo
was then placed on top. ‘

. In Iquitos, they had specific orders with cash
deposits for most of the tropical fish and animals that
were purchased, . .

They returned to Miami via Aruba when SUGARMAN
asked about the legality of flying over Cuba and was told :
it saved fuel. SUGARMAN was also told it was legal to take
cash deposits on orders and when SUGARMAN voiced objection,
GOODMAN said they would not fly over Cuba again, .

Two weeks later, SUGARMAN was told he could not go’

along on the trip since GOODMAN said LESSLIE and another |
individual had to go along and they had more experience in
purchasing fish. oo

tendent, British West Indian Airways, Miami

export firm. _

with any regularity.

him. He described GOODMAN as_a_manof fine reputation. He
stated that although he, POMEROY, had had a misunderstanding»
with GOODMAN on one occasion, he_felt GOODMAN was an honest —
man and would recommend him as such. In fact, after POMEROY
had demanded $200700°WHitH POMEROY claimed GOODMAN owed hin,
GOODMAN paid rather than argue. POMEROY stated that he had
sincé thought” about it” and“f6lt that GOODMAN was probably.
right about not owing POMEROY the money in the first instance.

GOODMAN was one of that. special breed of pilots who know ,
what they can do and what they cannot do concerning violations

he would be or could be openly charged with violations of
the laws of the United States. As far as GOODMAN's loyalty ”
