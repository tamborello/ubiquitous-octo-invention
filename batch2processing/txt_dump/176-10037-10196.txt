 

SECRET-EYES ONLY.
March 12, 1964

I must say I think Fergusen is right, and
far better from standpoint US-Moereccen
relations just to let matter drifg away, Am I
eorrect in deducing that main reason Mrs. Kennedy
wants publicity is because King reportedly toak
this villa away from somebody to give to her.
Hf this is cage, King will no doubt find same
other way to avoid returning ville.

9, Kennedy ic aleo protected because
if house matter ever becomes public again, she
has of course already declined it,

if you agrees, I'd like to clue Rabat

soonest, co poor Fergie doesn't give word to
press before we reprieve him,
