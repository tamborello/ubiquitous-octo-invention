pending, started a bookmaking operation at 200. Jupiter Road,
Garland, Texas, around 3/1/67. GEBRON had just prior to

Park (Dallas suburb), Texas, and was told to leave that
city or cease his operation. He moved his operation to
the above location in Garland and GEBRON and subject are
both involved in running that operation. GEBRON has
claimed to Dallas police. that he is not getting his line
from out of state, but appears from information furnished
by New York City PD, this may not be correct. Subjects are
both well-known gamblers and bookies in Dallas area and
MATTHEWS has long been known as general all-around hoodlum
and strong-arm-man. . ;

: Records of Southwestern States Telephone Company,
were checked by WAYNE WEAVER, Commercial Representative,
for SA HAROLD J... EDGERTON.

been in his place of business several times recently during
past weeks and was decent and sober and not threatening as
usual, Informant said MATTHEWS was still booking with GEBRON
but was unable to provide any_ specifics on the operation.

are presently engaged in booking operation in Garland. CI
will attempt to determine futher details concerning. this operation.
