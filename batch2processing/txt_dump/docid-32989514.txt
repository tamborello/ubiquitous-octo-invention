OFFICE MEMO # 80, Series 1975
SENSTUDY 75

The following information has been received from the
ur

"Captioned matter pertains to Bureau's handling of
requests from Senate and House Select Committees to study
governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities.
In connection with work of these committees, staff members may
seek to interview current and former FBI employees.

. "Recently, the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff has
interviewed several former employees and it is anticipated
that many more such personnel will be contacted.

"The FBI has pledged full cooperation with the Committee
and we wish to assist and facilitate any investigations under-
taken by the Committee with respect to the FBI. However, we
do have an obligation to insure that sensitive sources and
methods and ongoing sensitive investigations are. fully
protected. Should any former employee contact your office and
have any question regarding his obligation not to divulge infor-
mation obtained by virtue of his past FBI employmént, he should
be instructed to contact Legal Counsel, FBIHQ, by collect call.
Your conversations with former employees must be in keeping with
our pledge. It is believed such a procedure would insure proper
protection and also facilitate the work of the SSC."

As regards employees of our office, if any of you) are

contacted by members of the SSC staff the SAC, or in his absence the

ASAC,

should be advised and Legal Counsel FBIHQ will be contacted by

the SAC or ASAC.
