On 15 June 1964 a member of the Venezuelan Branch of the Movi-
. miento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Movement for Revo-
“ Lutionary ‘Recovery) claimed that the MRR has nO opéFational ~~
-| base ii Venezuela and does not intend to establish one, The mo
MRR maintains,;an office in the Dominican Republic and is J!
believed to have facilities for using that territory as an el
occasional staging point for attacks against. Cuba. The MRR,
‘however, does ‘not have a permanent base or training camp in-

the Dominican Republic. The Dominican-Government has little

,, interest in Supporting Cuban exile activities.at. the present .
time. : ' . : .

  

 

   

No large- ‘exile operations against Cuba by the MRR will
take place Until after the November 1964 elections in the .
‘United States, The MRR claims that this decision is based on
. the fact that at least six months of preparation will be re-
‘quired before internal conditions in Cuba will be favorable ‘. .
and that the ‘decision'does not imply close connivance between |
the MRR and, he. United States Administration. .
