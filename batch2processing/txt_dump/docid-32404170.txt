MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Director of Central Intelligence

VIA: Executive Director
FROM: John F. Pereira
Acting Director, Center for the Study of
Intelligence
â€˜SUBJECT: New Release of JFK Assassination Records

.

1. This memorandum is to advise you of a scheduled
release of additional CIA records related to the JFK
assassination.

. 2. On 1 September 1994, we plan to release to the
National Archives approximately 71,000 pages of JFK records
that are printed out copies of microfilmed documents. These
records were microfilmed in 1979-80 and added to the files
that the House Select Committee on Assassinations ordered
sequestered at CIA. This will bring to 211,000 the total
number of pages released by CIA under the JFK Assassination
Records Collection Act of 1992.

3. We are also reviewing some 10,000 pages originated
by other agencies, which will eventually be released after
coordination. by those agencies. In addition, we are
reviewing some 20,000 pages originated by Congressional
staff during the investigation of the assassination, which

are to be processed by the National Archives before they can
be made available to the public.

4. All documents held by CIA that are possibly related
to the assassination are to be provided to the Review Board
that was appointed earlier this year by the President. This
includes those records that appear to qualify for with-
holding under provisions of the Act relating to privacy,
foreign relations, relevancy, and sources and methods. The
Review Board will make the final determination as to
possible release of these records.
