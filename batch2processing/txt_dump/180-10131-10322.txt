ran Mr. Klein. What about the day-to-day living conditions,

3 Mr. Murphy. Well, he was not permitted to leave. He was

not permitted to depart? Other than that, in his day-to-day

 

on treatment, not the actual interrogation sessions, but just his

20 Mx. Murphy. Bagley, the Chief of the group, because they
31 felt they could not proceed because of the problems I have |

practical and legal security difficulties in that. If you pre-

” () 2 | Mr. Klein. So with regard to Helms, when he was DDP you
3 spoke to him directly. When he became Deputy Director or Direc+

4 tor, which eventually he did become, then the chain of command,

 

5 although you don't know of any specific instances, would have
6 | him still involved in the decisions? |
? Mr. Murphy. It would. In order to be absolutely correct
3 | about it, the DDP as one of the Deputy Directors for Operations;

!
9 made his own judgment as to what he would discuss with the

10 | Director, what he would not discuss with the Director.
YW Mr. Klein. There came a time in 1964, April 4, I believe, i
12 when the treatment received by Nosenko greatly changed in that ;
7 © 13 | hostile interrogations began, is that dorrect? |

the question.

5 Mr. Klein. Could you describe for us what the pattern was
32 | before as far as conditions and how it was changed?

Mr. Murphy. Well, the pattern before was one of pretty much

@ 24 | permitting Nosenko to call the shots. In other words, we wanted

6 Mr. Murphy. He was DDP.

VW Mr. Klein. Now, in the following years, when different

16 Mr. Klein. Can you tell us if you reported to the DDP?

73 Mr. Murphy. I can't give you a specific instance but the |
