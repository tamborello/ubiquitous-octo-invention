Subject: W.L.OLTMANS (10 June 1925)

On 29 December 1971 OLTHMANG invited the Cultural Attache of the
Russian Embassy KUZNETSOV for an evening in his house. The invit-
ation was also for some other members of the Russian Representation,
At the same time OLTMANS was to invite some six important journalists:
KUZNETSOV should ask OPALEV and IZWEKOV to come along with him.

The date agreed’on originally was 11 January 1972..It then was
changed twice. When 14 January also wasn't suitable, it was agreed
on 7 January to make the date for 18 January 1972 at 20,00 hrs.

From the invitation it could only be infered that ULIMANS wanted

to offer his guests an opportunity for an informal discussion.

About the background of the present good relations of OLTMANS with
the Soviet Representation in The Netherlands, section. B is able to
report the following:

1, In September 1970 OLTMANS says with some surprise that he sudden-
ly received an invitation to a party at the Russian Embassy.
He thinks it crazy; he doesn't belong to that club at all. But
his thinking is along the lines of those people.

2. In October 1970 OLTMANS appears to be interested in an interview
with KOSYGIN's son-in-law GVISHIANI who allegedly was connected
with American-Russian discussions about forming a mutual "think-
ing factory".

Presumably this had some connection with the so called Club of

Rome in which GVISHIANI plays a role.

Remark: GVISHIANI is chairman of the state committee for science
and technology and is suspected to be a highly placed
Intelligence Officer.

3. Begining March 1970 OLTMANS contacted the Press Attache OPALEV
from the Russian Embassy; OLTMANS would still like to have an
interview with GVISHIANIL.

It would be a filmed interview in which OLTMANS would cooperate
with the NOS. (TV).

in this period OPALEV's cooperation does not yet seem very
extensive.

4, Thanks to the cooperation of Aurelio PECCEL, chairman of the
Club of Rome, OLTMANS at the end of April 1971 succeeded in get-
ting in contact with GVISHIANI in Paris.
Also present at this discussion was the former member of the Russi
Embassy FEDEROVSKY, now chief of protocol of the state committee
for science and technology.

On 17 November OLTMANS allegedly discussed this business further

with GVISHTANI in Geneva.

discuss making the above mentioned films without the participation

OLTMANS wants to prevent LUNS getting any future opportunity to
