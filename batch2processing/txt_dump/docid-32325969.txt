MM 105-4230

 

The report of SA MAURICE F. FARABEE, dated
March 28, 1961, at Miami, in the case entitled "Changed,
GUILLERMO FEDERICO COLOMA Y ENRIGUEZ, aka, IS - Cuba,
RA - Cuba," reflects that DOMINICIS was interviewed by
the Miami Office on February 15, 1961, concerning
FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO, aka, "El Mexicano," the
subject of Bufile 105- 78976, Miami file 105- 1891, and
concerning GOLOMA,

on the basis of the information reflected
in instant report, no additional information is deemed
warranted by the Miami Office. DOMINICIS is believed to .
possess insufficient potential to warrant his development \
as a PSI; therefore, this case is being closed by the
Miami Office.
