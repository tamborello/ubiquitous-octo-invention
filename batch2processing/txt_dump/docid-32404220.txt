Another episode in May, 1964 compounded JURE's problems. |
Rogelio Cisneros had obligated $50,000 of JURE money to an
El Monte, California, arms manufacturing company for. ‘weapons

to be shipped to Florida. ‘The Revenue division of the,

_. Treasury Department, planning a raid on the arms company,

asked the CIA if it, had any knowledge of this purchase, 4+

which was illegal under U.S. laws. Working under the

“autonomous operations" guidelines, the CIA denied any

involvement and advised JURE to make use of one of its Latin
American connections to facilitate the shipment outside the
U.S. 42

At this point, there began a general disintegration of

JURE membership’? Rogelio Cisneros informed the CIA on

August 24, (1964 that he was resigning from the organization.

He contended Ray was incapable of directing both political and

military activities.44 | Then another key leader, Carlos

SUBJECT: JFK Records-Possible Negative Publicity for CIA

Ey

1. In our review of the JFK assassination records we have
identified a document, that could generate publicity about:
possible CIA involvement in an illegal incident in 1964. The
document is a draft version of the published report of the House
Special Committee on Assassinations and is to be released by the
National Archives.

2. The document describes an attempt by the CIA-funded
Cuban Revolutionary: Junta (JURE), an-anti-Castro exile group, to
purchase $50,000 worth of arms from a California company for
shipment to Florida. The purchase was illegad. ‘The Treasury
Department apparently planned a raid on the arms company and
asked CIA if it had any knowledge of the purchase by JURE.
According to the draft, CIA denied any involvement and advised
JURE to arrange the shipment outside the US..

3. The published report described the arms purchase and the

planned Treasury raid but did not mention the imterchange with
CIA.

jncluded. Felipe Pazos, Raul Chibas, Rogelio Cisneros, Ramon Bar-
quin and Justo Carrillo.(2) Although Ray felt the Cuban Revolu-
tionary Council was no longer effective, he attempted to receive finan-
cial assistance from, it until JURE gained momentum. (3)

967) As its opening promotional salvo, JURE issued a “Declara-
tion of Principles.” Tt called for free elections, the restoration of hu-
man rights and social justice, new economic development programs
and agrarian reform, breaking relations with the Soviet bloc, restora-
tion of legitimate property, proscription of the Communist Party and
release of political prisoners. 4 . .

(268) Ray’s group was considered an “autonomous” anti-Castro
Cuban group by the CIA.(5) The concept of autonomous operations
was conceived by Walter Rostow, State Department counsel. (6) Ros-
tow proposed a Utrack two” approach to Cuban operations to paral
regular CIA-controlled Cuban teams. (7) This approach would enable
financial aid, advice and guidance to Cuban Jeaders such as Ray.(8)
‘Autonomous operations were approved June 1963.(9)

(269) The rule under which the operations functioned set forth the
following guidelines:

4. Operations to be executed exclusively by Cuban nationals dedi-
cated to the idea that the overthrow of the Castro/Communist re-
gime must be accomplished by Cubans inside and outside Cuba
working in coricert.

9, If the effort to overthrow the Cuban regime became too costly
in human lives, the United States would withdraw financial sup-
port and would not consider resumption at any future date.

3. All operations had to be mounted outside the territory of the

publicly deny any participation in the groups activities.

5. U.S. presence and direct participation would be kept at an
absolute minimum. An experienced liaison officer would be assigned
to each group to provide general adviee, funds and material support.

6. No fixed time schedule would be given to these operations. (70)

(270) Possibly because of this loosely structured control over JURE.
the day-to-day activities of the group were closely monitored, A TU RE
member, for instance, was in frequent. contact with an individual
and supplied him with a variety of confidential information about
JURE. This source provided information on Ray’s meeting with
Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy in September 1963;(17) Ray's
