1, THE LAST SECRET WRITING MESSAGE FROM AMTRUNK/10 WAS
RECEIVED AT WAVE IH JULY 1964. PREVIOUS TO THIS MESSAGE, WAVE
HAD RECEIVED CHLY CNE OTHER S/W LETTER FROM AMTRUNK/10 SINCE HIS
RECRUITHENT IN HAVANA IN AUGUST 1963. BY CONTRAST, WAVE SENT 10
S/W MESSAGES TO AMTRUNK/10 DURING THE PERIOD FROM SEPTEMBER 1963
THROUGH AUGUST 1564, SINCE AMTRUNK/10 HAD DEMONSTRATED LITTLE
UNETEATIVE UN COCPERATING WITH KUBARK AND SINCE HE WAS ALSO
EMBROULED IN THE AMLASH COMPLEX, WAVE DECIDED AGAINST CONTINUING

TO PROD AMTRUNK/10 TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE MHAPRCH GBJECTIVES

ASSIGNED TO HIM. WAVE HAS THCREFORE DISCONTINUED ANY FURTHER
CORRESPONDENCE WITH AMTRUNK/ 10.

2. THE KEY TO AMTRUNK/I0'S PRESENT SITUATION IN CUBA MIGHT
BE FOUND IN THE HEADQUARTERS-DIRECTED AMLASH/ 1 OPERATION, THE
STATUS OF WHICH IS PRESENTLY UNCLEAR TO WAVE.

ANOTHER COMPLICATING FACTOR MAY BE THE ARREST IN LATE

36
DECEMBER 1965 OF ANTRUNK/11, A SUPPORT ASSET KKOWN TO AMTRUNK/ 10.
THE GHLY DETAILS Kricwht TO WAVE SURROUNDING THE ARREST OF AMTRURK/ 11

ARE FOUNO IN REFS B AND C.

WAVE BELIEVES IT POINTLESS To QUESTION NIEVES FURTHER On

&,

AMTRUNK/10, SINCE INFO THUS FAR PROVIDED, LIKE ALL NIEVES® ENFO,
HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT. WHILE EH 16 JANUARY 66 DEBRIEFING HEEVES
SAID AMTRUUK/10 WAS CHE GF SEX CGHMANDERS OF HIS GROUP WHO WERE
CONSPIRING AGAINST FIDEL, CN 30 JANUARY, WHEN HE ERLARGED THE

COMMANDERS GROUP TO 10, HE STATEO AMTRUNK/10 WAS NOT & MEMBER OF
THE GROUP, AS INDICATED REF D, THERE 1S STRONG PROBABILITY THE
ENTERE CONSPIRATGRIAL GROUP 1S A FIGMENT OF NIEVES® IMAGINATION,
