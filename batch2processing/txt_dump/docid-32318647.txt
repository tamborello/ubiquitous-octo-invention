start. They then read newspapers and comment on their findings.

KARATSUBA states that one of his newspapers carried an article

in which a world champion rife shot was quoted as saying that one

man could not fire the weapon killing Pres. Hennedy three times

in five seconds, would take at least two men. DIAZ does not think

taey got the right rifle, then relates that the NY Tims has an

article stating that OSWALDS mother was show a picture of RUBY

seventeen hours before OSWALD was killed. KARATSUBA states that

the important thing to him is how OSWALD could be such a good shot

after being out of the Marines for three or four years and spending

two and a half years in the Soviet Union where they would not let :

him have a gun. S“ates the important thing is not whether he is

Marxist or what ever but that he did so well in five seconds and

only ordered the gun in August. KARATSUBA states the ‘FBI saw

OSWALD carry the gun in @ package, DIAZ xorrects him and. states

it was neighbors who saw the package. DIAZ wonders where Gen.

WALKER was during this time. DIAZ thinks the FBI isinvolved

with the Dallas State Police, laughs and states thinks the Govenor

has a finger in the pie. KARATSUBA does not think the FBI was

involved. DIAZ tells KARATSUBA he should-réad about MALCOEM X

speech made at Manhattan Center, KARATSUBA heard over the radio

that there were films showing two men in the window. FEINSTEIN

enters. DIAZ telks KARATSUBA quickly and softly, "hide the bottle,

hide the bottle." KARATSUBA tells FEINSTEIN that he taliied with

TOMACHINSKI Wh6 Wants to see him on business, FEINSTEIN exits.

They return to the discussion of tha two men ih the window, KARAT

states he would not be suprised if the other man was a policeman,

laughs. DIAZ suggest that maybe one was a f--king policeman and

the other one FBI, states these f—icing FBI Agents are local boys

and they are all poisoned and emotional about this shit. DIAZ asks

wonder where is BOBBY, he allwaysyhad a big mouth, where ishe now.

KARAT states everybody had something to say but BOBBY, K thinks

BOBBY knows just a little bit more than anyone who just opens his \

mouth. DIAZ states hasn't heard too much from HOOVER. K asks » HERBERT? :

DIAZ states no, EDGAR. K states , he is in poor health you know.

They discuss the telegram Madan Nhu sent and the situation in Viet.
