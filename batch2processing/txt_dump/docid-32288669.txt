that PCI should get to "the banker, JAMES W. EGAN" . S t
in Florida who has ALDERISIO over a barrel. FCI pointed a ;
out that ALDERISIO did not"spell it out" but meant that 7 I

CG 87-19740

ror[___ stated that he turned down ALDERISIO's

request inasmuch as he is afraid to get deeply involved
with him in his activities. PCI stated that in his
Opinion ALDERISIO is a violent and vicious man who would
not permit anyone to stand in his way.

CG 6588-C-TE advised SA RUSSELL R. GIRSCH
on April 13, 1964, that ALDERISIO states that he is
now gathering information to assist MARSHALL CAIFANO,
not because he likes CAIFANO but ‘to help the syndicate
win the case. ALDERISIO recently made a trip to Washington
and engaged a WILLIAMS, BAKER's attorney,
to represent him in a Florida case. CI stated that
while ALDERISIO was in Florida on vacation, he fired
attorney (FNU) KLEIN as he felt KLEIN was being got -
to by the Government. ALDERISIO stated that he likes
Attorney ERICKSEN who is representing him in the Denver
case.

CG 6588-C-TE stated that GEORGE BEIBER,
Chicago attorney, stated that ERICKSEN told him that

-the first attorney ALDERISIO hired or tried to hire

refused to represent ALDERISIO after ALDERISIO told him
that if he lost the case he would take care of the \
United States Attorney who prosecuted the case.

CG 6588-C-TE stated that he heard IRWIN WEINER
instruct MAX LURIE, a Florida attorney, to send all
copies of papers pertaining to ALDERISIO's case to
Chicago Attorney GEORGE BEIBER.

CG 6588-C-TE stated that ALDERISIO. advised
that he had received a telephone call from OBBIE (probably
AARON OBERLANDER) who is in Florida. OBERLANDER stated
that he had found some good information to aid PHIL's
defense. ALDERISIO expressed doubt to this stating that
OBBIE was probably just trying to get more money from
hin. .
