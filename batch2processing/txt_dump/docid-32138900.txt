Dear Mr. Innes:

This has reference to your letter of
April 2, 196. concerning Joseph and Reva BERNSTEIN.

 

2. No doubt this couple are identical to
the BERNSTEINs mentioned in our exchange of corre-
spondence under our reference D 933-2328 (your file
100-1131). This deals with requests from your office
for the names of registered owners for two automobiles
observed at the home of Joseph BERNSTEIN in Detroit,
in 1958 and again in 1961. Investigation at that time
revealed that Reva BERNSTEIN has a sister, Zelda (Mrs.
David Alkin) ROBINSON, residing at Hamilton, Ontario.

 

With regard to the request outlined in
your letter under reference, we are having enquiries
carried out at Hamilton in an effort to determine if
Joseph and Reva BERNSTEIN were visiting that point in
November 1963. Also, should it be learned that they
were in Canada, our investigation will be extended to
determine if, in fact, they were interviewed as stated.
You will be advised promptly of our findings.

he Meanwhile, we might mention that from
