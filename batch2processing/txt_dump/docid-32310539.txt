analyst for Ex DR leader RAFAEL L, TRUJILLO MOLINA 1956 - 60,
claimed to MM 768-C that SAPP had for years sold information to
the Dominican Government and the files in the DR should show
this. ,

ra :

It is noted that JOHNSON has been interviewed on two
occasions as a result of nis claims to knowledge of the Dominican
Intelligence operation. On both occasions wnen specifically
questioned ne claimed to nave no specific knowledge.

Miami files further reflect that on October 12, 1958,
EDUARDO HERNANDEZ, then Cuban Consul in Miami, advised SA ROBERT
J. DWYER in connection with the investigation of the case
entitled SERGIO SANJENIS CABARROCAS, aka; ET AL, Bufile 2-1505,
that Detective CHARLES SAPP of the Miami Police Department,
had informed him of-the arrest of HUGO GONZALEZ LAJONCHERE, one
of the individuals involved, and furnished HERNANDEZ with a
police report on the matter.

It is noted that the above case referred to the
attempted formation of a demolition team to operate against ae
the then Cuban Government which HERNANDEZ thenxepresentéd in Miami.

Miami fiks reflect that SAPP has in the past furnished
information in connection with criminal intelligence matters to
the Miami Office and at the present time he is furnishing
information to the Miami Office in connection with the hoodlum
program. :

It is the recommendation of the Miami Office that .
. SAPPibke interviewed in connection with his past connection with
the DR Government and specifically asked about the item appearing |
in the January 24, 1962, issue of El Caribe, the DR newspaper
which published a list of names and amounts received or paid.
In this list the name SARGENTO CHARLES H. (Miami).... $RD100.00
appeared under the heading "International Affairs."
