a ia iy Zpst, -the matter of the receipt of money by Dominican
aS 42 agents in the Miami area throu the Dominican Consulate '
—f{ gt ni Zuas mentioned, and PSI stated that in all probability, i
a & SAPP is not even aware that his name appeared on the payroll
Ss Ny of the Dominican Government, because he never received
QO C any money through the consulate. According to the inform- . !
aat:, some person in the Dominican Republic, or somewhere
in the Dominican service, quite probably received this ; .
money. Informant is acquainted with SAPP, and stated j
that the only money SAPP ever received was money paid to ,
him for his work of guard duty at the Dominican Consulate
in Miami, and this work was approved by the Miami Police
zg ro Department, and performed by SAPP in his off-duty hours.
