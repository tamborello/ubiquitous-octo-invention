FROM: John F. Pereira
: Chief, CSI/HRG

SUBJECT: . Priority Request from Chairman,
JFK Assassination Records Board

1. (S) The purpose of this memorandum is to advise you of a
priority request from the Chairman of the JFK Assassination Records
Review Board (ARRB). The request concerns records related to Lee

Harvey Oswald that may be held by the Mexican Government.

2. (S) At his initiative, I met recently with the ARRB
Chairman, Judge John Tunheim. He said the reason for _ the meeting was
to ask that CIA assist the Board by making inguiries(. ~sPto
determine if the Mexican Government has certain records related to
Oswald's activities in Mexico in late 1963. Of particular interest

to the Board is whether [the Mexicans have c copies © of tapes” 3 from” “joint >

(tel- “tap operations,’ including coverage of Oswald’s telephone ‘alis
‘fo the Soviet Embassy./ He said that locating such records is “the
highest priority of the Board.” (The attached letter from the.

ARRB’s General Counsel explains the Board’s interest.)

 

 

 

3. (S) Earlier this year, the Board sought unsuccessfully
to obtain information about Oswald from the Mexican Government
via the State Department. (See attached cable.) Mexico responded

by providing copies of the same material that had been made
available to the Warren Commission in 1964. The problem for the
Board was that, in making the request to Mexico, it did not want

 

 

 

 

 

to reveal information about that
the Board knew of from CIA rééords~ eing Sensitive to e

Re: Request to CIA to contact! regarding LIENVOY intercepts of
Oswald telephone calls in Mexico City :

Some time ago the Review Board requested informally that CIA contact —d
(Jin Mexico City for information related to Lee Harvey Oswald. During your
recent visit here we discussed with you the feasibility of your making such contacts. I
am writing in response to your request that we memorialize our request and provide
some background information.

 

 

 

The Review Board believes that all reasonable steps should be taken to account for all
telephonic intercepts of Oswald during his vigit to Mexico City in September-October
1963. There is evidence that CIA intercepted some telephone calls through an operation:
named LIENVOY €onducted| __. _ We
believe that it would be appropriate for CIA to contact direétly,
to inquire as to whether the Mexican authorities retained copies of LIENVOY
telephonic take, specifically the actual recordings of Oswald's telephone calls to the
Soviet Embassy during the period of September 27 through October 3, 1963.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Review Board previously has sought information from the Mexican Government
through appropriate diplomatic channels. For reasons that are obvious to those

familiar with Mexico City issues, the Review Board could not raise with Mexican
officials nor with the U.S. State Department the possible existence of additional tape
recordings that might be in the hands of certain officials. Thus, at the behest of the
Review Board, the Department of State requested that the Mexican federal government
and local government agencies conduct general searches of their files for records
related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The Mexican government responded

Dear Mr. Marwell:

Enclosed is the diplomatic note received from the Mexican 7

- government, dated March 12, 1997, which responds to the ARRB‘s
request for any additional documents that the Mexican

government might have relating to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy. The, Embassy evidently submitted the
request to the Mexican government on June 13, 1996, but:did not
report the action through telegraphic channels. The reference
in the telegram is to our recent query.

The Mexican government note conveys copies of the
diplomatic notes. exchanged between Mexico and the United States
in 1963-1964 regarding the initial U.S. request for Mexican
documents relevant to the investigation into Lee Harvey
Oswald’s visit to Mexico in the fall of 1963. Most of these
notes were published in volume XVIII of the Warren Commission
Report. They also duplicate copies of the same correspondence
found in Legal Adviser‘’s and Mexico City post files that are
included in State’s collection at NARA. I have stamped
enclosed copies of pages bearing "confidential" classification
markings. I am also enclosing a copy of Mexico City telegram
3078 of March 31. ;

According to my records, we have now received responses
from all posts contacted through the A bureau. Minsk remains
ongoing. Final responses have been received from Bonn, Paris,
London, Moscow, and now Mexico City. Interim responses. have
been received from from Tokyo and Ottawa. As it has been some
tine since Tokyo reported that the Japanese government would be
searching for documents, the ARRB might wish to prepare a

by sending copies of the same documentation and correspondence that the GOM had
made available to the Warren Commission in 1964.

The basis for our interest in your contacting appropriate Me Mexican offidials'is found in
CIA document 104-10004-10199, which was reviewed by the Board on September 19,
1995. On page 5 of this document (not including the cover sheet) information that the
Board agreed to protect, due to the sensitivity of sources and methods involved,
suggests that the Mexican security forces may have had their own copy of the October 1
intercept on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is unclear whether this statement refers to the
transcript or to an actual tape containing the phone call. Nevertheless, it provides
enough evidence to warrant additional inquiries on this matter.

For your reference we are enclosing copies of the reference documents as well as copies
of the correspondence between the DOS and the Mexican government.

We would appreciate your contacting appropriate officials to determine what
reasonably can be known about this and related matters, and ask that you provide a
response to this request by November 14, 1997. We are fully aware of the sensitivity of
this type of request and do not wish to take any action that would compromise existing
intelligence operations. If necessary, we would be pleased to-discuss with you ways in
which we might further elaborate on this request, including person-to-person
discussions with appropriate officials either here or in Mexico.

Thank you for your continued assistance and cooperation.
