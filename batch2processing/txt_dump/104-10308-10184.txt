. 15. WAVE Station regrets that reference C has not been

answered to date. In reply we can only state that AMLEO-3

. was thoroughly briefed on the limitations of his alias docunzentation
when said documentation was isaued to him. Me was told that the
credit card docunents could never be used for identification or
credit purposea. He. had.alao been warned to avoid situations
where he would be asked for positive identification, such as
renting a car, and by attempting to procure a rental car in
ZRMETAL he was acting contrary to instructions given to him
by his WAVE-C/0, On ANLEO-3's return to WAVE he was caStigated for
his actions, and again briefed on the limitations of hfs alias
documentation, In order to strengthen his alias documentation

In regard to points a and b in paragraph 2 of reference C,
the KURIOT representative in WAVE Station states that tne |__|
. drivers license issue o Joseph A, Heese is a valid, backstoppe
drivers license for actual use by the Subject and the address
a legitimate safehouse with backstopped rental cover. Subject's
cover story was that he recently moved to the Miami area from
New Orleans, Louisiana (which city the Subject lived m for
B2veral years and has relatives residing there). The Subjct's
. documentation is therefore correct for his cover story, The
spelling of “instalment” on the National Credit Card was correctly

. . 16,  AMLBO-3 continues to receive a flat salary of five
“hundred dollars ($500.00) per month, and also is paid approximately
one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month for purchase of fooustuffs

since he is encouraged to cat his meals in the KUBARK
safehouse and stay out of public places. We have also continued
to pay the wife of AMLEO-5 the amount of one hundred and twenty five
dollars ($125.00) per month for subsistance for herself and her
two ‘children to supplement the $120.00 per month she receives

. from. the Cuban Refugee Center. The C/O has continued his efforts
‘to find part-time employment for Mrs. AMLEO-5 go that KUBARK ~
could be relieved of the necessity to support her, but to date
we have been unsuccessful in our efforts primarily because Mrs,
AMLEO=}5 has never worked in her life aod has no work skills
whatsoever. No other financial expenditures of note were made
during the period, and no financial assistance is presently

- contemplated for any other AMLECs.

     

    
     
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
         
   
     

“ INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

17. During the reporting period no positive intelligence
reports were disseminated by the AMLEO group since none of the
active agents are locatec! in the target area, nor do they
circulate in Cuban exile circles.

     
       
       
 

18, We are continuing to utilize AMLEO-3 as a consultant
on the NHAPRCN program, and to this end are planning to have
him expand his reporting of personality information on selected
individuals and to utilize him to explain interconnections
between various individuals and groups as they take shape in

FUTURE PLANS

° -19. Future plans for operational exploitation of AMLEO-3
continue to remain the same ag outlined in detail in reference -D.
The operational use of AMLEOQ-3 in defection/recruitment

operations will not be permitted until his wife and children are. a
successfully put into asylum in'’one of the Latin American Embassics

in Havana,

   
 
  
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
   

 

20. WAVE Station will continuc to work on AMLUG-3 developmental
cases concentrating on MHAPRON leads, and attempt to build two~
way communications channels into such leads. AMLEO-6 is still
considered to be the best qualified lead by AMLEC-4 to act ae.
principal agent and recruiter of other disaffected military
personnel in Cuba. Details on these developmental operations
will be reported via separate dispatch.

3. To this end steps were initiated in on 24 July 1963
to put the AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO~2 into asylum in the Nexican
Embassy Havana, .The AMLKO-3 family and AMLEO-2 were advised
via the (AMWEE+JSOWVL channel on 4 August 1963 to preparo
themselves for asylum and to await further orders via the same .

channel. KUBARK, Station in Mexico City, meanwhile, took urgent:
-.action through channels to have the HNexican
Foreign Hinist OUTALN Visas ror the AMLEO-3 family and

AMLEO=-2; and then send word to the Mexican Embassy in. Havana,
Cuba that the AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 should be granted asylum
when they appeared at the Mexican Consulate under cover of
obtaining their visas, The visa portion of the operation was
satisfactorily completed and notification of same was sent into
_the Mexican Embassy in Havana; but word re asylum for the
AMLEO-3 family and ANLEO-2 was not sent to the Mexican embassy
due to insecure comuo channels and lack of trusted couriers, and
‘to date no secure. method has yet been found to notify the Mexican
| Embassy in Havana that asylum should be granted to the AMLEOs,

 

; 4. As a-result of the above, word was sent to CAMWEE-1}

‘via OWVL on 11 September requésting he cetem ine whether or not

Identity A‘ ‘would be willing to act as intermediary to receive

_the AMLEQ-3 family and AMLEO-2 into asylum at a specific tine
_.and date at the Mexican consulate, “AMWEE-i)asked for

on 13. September via pouch, and more detailed guidance.on the

matter. was - ‘sent to bin via’ oye on 4: September. aA final reply

|AMWEE-1\ momentarily. AL ‘the ‘AMWEB=2 reply is fivorable, then

he will be told to arrange thé meeting at the Mexican consulate
between the AMLEOs and Identity A so that they can be taken into
asylum by the Mexicans.

. &, As noted in reference B, if the’ Auiee-T \roport is a
negative one, then consideration will be given to having the
. AMLEOs take asylun in the Uruguayan Embassy in Havana, The
test case utilizing AMCANCE-3, mentioned in paragraph 5 3‘ of
reference B, is to be attempted on or about 2) August 1865, and
Af this attempt at asylun is successful then arrangencnts will
-. be made to have the AML“Gs enter the Uruguayan [mbassy in the
same manner,

-G6,. Ags noted in paragraph 1 of reference B, the wife

of AMLEO-3 finally made a direct contact with AMTHUG-1 on 7

i September 1963, while he was at his Santa Maria beach house

and appealed to: him for permission to leave Cuba with her
echildrem and rejoin her husband AMLEO-3 in the United States,
“On 14 September 1963 AMLHO~3 received a letter from his wife
giving more details on the above mecting. The wife of AULIO~3
had been visiting the beach home of a family friend, situated
next.to that of ANTHUG-1 on Santa Maria beach, gn x daily basis
‘hoping to-see AMTHUG-1. Finally, on 7 September 196°, she saw
him swimming alone in the ocean and prowptly went into the water,
introduced herself , and requested prmission to talk to him. .
AMTHUG-1 granted this permission, and during their conversation
AMTHUG-1 made it clear he would not grant Mrs, AMLEO-3 permission
to depart Cuba at this tine, stating that the tinue was not Ky
propitious due to the attacks and raids being carried out :
* against Cuba, and that Mrs. AMLEO-3 would just have to wait.
." Mrs. AMLEQ-3 then told him she did not sce why he was holding her
i and her children responsible for what her husband uid; that she
feared her husband might forget her and their children completely .
4f the separation continued, and that if AMLFO-3 was left much xt
+ longer alone he would find a woman to replace her, ANTiLUG-1
' yeplicd by asking her "Do you consider yourself a burden to your
busband?" The wife replied "It is possible", and ANTHUG-1 then
asked "But he calls you every day." err ee

_ EFFORTS TO LEGALLY EXFILTRATE AMLEQ~3 FAMILY -FiQk CUBA _

 

; Z.. Since transmission of refcrence A to Headquarters scveral
developments occurred which effectively eliminated several alternate
|. ‘solutions to the problem of the AMLEO-3 family in Cuba, ‘The
i alternate solutions that were eliminated, as found in paragraph
4... 3.08 reference A, were (a) "Maintain Status Quo as a Family
: “attempting Leave Cuba via Offices of. Swiss Embassy as Part of the
American Repatriation Program"; .(b): "Have, AMLEOQ-4 Family
. Withdraw’ ‘Papers From. the Swiss” Embassy | aid. American Repatriation
a ‘Program and “Attempt Leavé Cuba’.as ‘Normal Refugees. via Mexico -

“Or Spain"; and (e) “Haye the AMLEGS Family Case Taken up With the
coc” Through the ‘Donovan’ Channel fer Possible Legal Exfiltration”.
Elimination of the above alternates left only two solutions
that were at all feasible; (c) "Have the AMLLO-3 Family Take
Asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mexican Embassics in Havana",
or (d) "Have the AMLEQ-3 Family Exfiltrated black in a Maritime

_Cperation by. either a KRUBARK. or Independent Maritine Team,”

: Because of the inherent risk involved in a black exfiltration,

.. dt. was decided that the AMLEO-5 family should be put into
asylum in either the Uruguayan or iiexican embassics with all
possible speed,

7. Later during the conversation AMTHUG-1 asked
Mra. AKLEO-3 if her husband still had the presentation Soviet
- pistol that he.had given him in 1961, and Mrs. ANLEO-3
informed him that her husband had taken it with him when he
defected and asked ANTHUG-1 1f he wanted it returned to hin.
AMTHUG-1 did not reply to the question, Later on, while
discussing her conversation with AMTHUG-1 with Identity B,
' Identity B suggested to Mrs, AMLEO-3 that she request AMLEO-3
to send the pistol back to AMTHUG-1 via Ambassador LECUUGA
at the United Nations, NYC, Identity B added that the return
of the pistol might help matters since the loss of the pistol had
been one of the things that bothered ANTHUG-1 most when
AMLEO-3 defected, (i.e. AMLEO-3-has noted that these special
presentation Sovict pistols were given by ANTHUG-1 to probably
- less than ten people in Cuba, and their presentation had a very
special meaning for ANTHUG-1 since tie recipients were supposed
to be his very personal and close fricnds., AMLEO-3 clains
that not even ANLOUT-1 had received one of these special
_ presentation pistols from ANTHUG-1.) Consideration is being
-given to AMTHUG-1's request, if it would assist Bra. AMLEO<3
in her efforts to leave Cuba, but for the time being the pistot
will be held by KUBARK.

8. ANTHUG-1 also told Mrs. AHLEO-3 that her husband had
stelen a light plane when he fled and implied (although she
does not so state directly) that he would like to see it
returned, The balance of Mrs. AMLEO-3's letter concerned her
desire to- leave Cuba, mentioned the necessity for cimness by both
she and“her hisband with no rash actions, and without giving.
any additional facts stated that-her conversation with ANTHUG-1
had been a long one but that she could not get him to make :
any promises re hor departure,

9. During the operational period one of AMLEOQ-3's
‘operational leads, whom he had written a report on for the
AMTRUNK PM operation, was recruited via the recently successful
ANTRUNK infiltration operation and given the crypt of AMTRUNK-10,
AMLEO=3 also screened additional ANTRUNK leads and KRUTUBE
military leads during the period and was able to submit
reports on some four individuals for these operations. All such
{leads were fed to him mixed in with many other Cuban names,

10. ANLEO-3 also assisted in the handling of AMLEO-5's \
wife during the period when she established direct telephonic
communication with her husband in Cuba, and tried to comvince |
him that she wanted to return to Cuba with her children,

only knew what day the calls would be coming in and never the
hour. He also assisted Mre. AMLEO-S in recording the last tcleph:
conversation she had with her husband, In this same operation
AMLEO~3 also assisted the Case Officer in the conversations
held with the mother of AMLEO-5 while she was in the United
States, although he vas never allowed to cstablish direct
contact with the mother. We had hoped that the mother of
AMLEO-S would attempt to establish contact onher own with
AMLEO-3, but to WAVE Station knowledge she never attempted to do

contact efforts (maintaining his cover as being disassociated
with OCDYOKE).

13, During tlie, réporting period AMLEO=3 has. consistently
been cooperative with his C/O and has maintained a good attitude
towards his work. During the latter part of Agust 1963 AMLEO-3
began to lose his patience with the slow progress in gotting
his wife into asylum, and began requesting permission to return
to Cuba himself in order to exfiltrate his wife black, AMLEO-3
became quite demanding in this regard and claimed that KUSARK's:
time had run out, and since he had waited paticntly for nine
months he now felt it was his turn to try his luck. ALEOQ-3
is extremely confident of his own ability in action situations
and operations and extensive argumentation was neoded to:
‘persuade him that such a course of action yould be suicidal
for his wife and children and that his wisest course of action
would be to give us additional time to bring the asylum operation
to a successful covclusion, Because of AMLEQ-3's faith in
higher authority, COS JMWAVE, Andrew Kk. REUTEMAN visited AMLL£O-3

unilateral action on his part would only be counterproductive
and playing right into ANTHUG-l's hands. KUBARK's limited
commitments to AMLEO-3 were also reviewed along with the history

that the only productive course of action left to him was to

best.. Absolutely no further commitments were made to AMLEO-3
during these discussions and alternate courses of action if
the asylum attempts fail were not discussed but instead left in

abeyance,
