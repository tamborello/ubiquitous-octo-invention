8. J.C. King. He was Chief of the WH Division
and was listed in the IG report as being witting of the plan.
In 1967 he denied knowledge of it.

9. ‘Justin O'Donnell.’ Mentioned on page 38 of the
report, ‘O'Donnell’ was.to have been in charge of the assassi-
nation of Patrice Lamumba by agent QJWIN; however, he surveyed
the scene and decided he wanted no part in an assassination
attempt. ‘

10. Bruce Cheever. He was Harvey's deputy in 1962
and was listed on page 55 as having been'witting of Phase II.

ll. Lawrence Houston. First mentioned on page 62
of the report. He was requested by Colonel Edwards to call
on an Assistant Attorney General to explain the bugging incident
in Las Vegas. It appears from the IG report that Houston was
witting of aspects of Phase I which led up to the wiretapping
incident. On May 7, 1962, Houston, along with Sheffield
Edwards, briefed Attorney General Kennedy on the Phase I
Operation.

12. General Carter. Carter was DDCI under John
McCone.° In April, 1962, he was briefed by Houston on Phase I.
He said he "understood" the situation and "in due time might
brief the Director, Mr. McCone." However, the 1967 report
states, "There is no indication that General Carter was
further briefed on the full details of the assassination plot
against Castro."

13. Robert A. Maheu. Maheu, of course, was the
private investigator who served as the Agency's contact with
Roselli during Phase I.

14, Edward P. Morgan. He was Maheu's attorney in
1966 when the CIA intervened with the Long committee. He
excused Maheu as a witness in its investigation of invasions
of privacy. According to the IG report, Maheu indicated that
he might brief his attorney Morgan fully about his past acti-
vities so that Morgan would be able to decide how best to
represent him.

He is mentioned on page 100 of the report.

23. Juan Orta. First mentioned on page 25 of the
report, he was said to be the "inside" man who was going to
plant pills in Castro's food. Apparently, the Agency, in 1967,
felt that Orta was either in the U.S. or otherwise available.
In speculating as to whether others could reconstruct the
details of this report, it stated, on page 123, “Orta can
confirm the pill element of Phase I."

24. Tony Varoha (Dr. Manuel Antonié De Verona
de Loredo). Varona was used as a funnel for pills in Phase I.
He was a prominent member of the Cuban exile community. Varona
was also mentioned, on page 132, as a possible source of
information about Phase I.
