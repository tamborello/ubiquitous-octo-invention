On. 6/2/75, CG 9561=PC advised SA FRANK J. FORD that
"Potsy" PEARL is operating his bookmaking operation on his own
on the north side of Chicago. Source stated there is an
excellent chance that in the very near future his entire
operation will be placed under LENNIE PATRICK. From what he
can gather, source stated SAM GIANCANA no longer gets any >
income from PEARL's operation. U

Source stated that GIANCANA is very much on his own
and prefers it that way. Source advised that like a number of
old time Mafia leaders, GIANCANA has accumulated great wealth
and is not interested in acquiring a source of income from
Chicago area Mafia operations. Source stated there has been
no conversation concerning GIANCANA and apparently GIANCANA
is not presenting any problem to the present Mafia bosses.
