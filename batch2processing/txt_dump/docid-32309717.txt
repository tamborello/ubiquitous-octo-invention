various means to have the matter squashed. DARDIS related
| in stric fidence that one of his sergeants was approached
by HARRY WASSER, one of the owners of Chary's Restaurant and
_j) | Cocktail?Lounge, North Bay Village, to determine if he,
[ee DARDIS, .could be approached with a'proposition. LASSER indi-
a cated that he was acting as a middle man in an effort to get
this matter squashed. DARDIS commented that his sergeant
told him a sum of $15,000.00 would be paid to DARDIS if he
would see to -it that the matter was dropped. DARDIS also
said his sergeant learned from LASSER that LASSER was acting
L244 in behalf of S CHLAR, owner of the Treasure Isle Motel.
Z He remarked that | sergeant has set up another meeting with
ta LASSER and at that time LASSER will be told that DARDIS will
| f} only talk to SCHLAR regarding the matter.

DARDIS further stated that he has discussed. the
matter with DANIEL P. SULLIVAN, Operating Manager of the
Miami Crime Commission, and the State's, Attorney's Office.
He said the State's Attorney's Office is making plans to Po,
i secure adequate evidence with the view toward prosecuting .
| SCHLAR should he make the $15,000.00 offer to DARDIS per-

‘ |sonally. "

DARDIS also advised that another similar payoff od
proposition is beginning to move beyond the r stage. He ,
said one of his men was approached by one TONED RRHONESON, fJOler
whose identity or background is unknown to DARDIS\X as -to the
amount of money that would bereeded to pay off the Chief of
Police so that gambling would be permitted at the Harbor
Spa Hotel, North Bay Village. DARDIS related this proposi-
tion is moving much slower than the one previously explained,
and as a result he is concentrating on the Treasure Isle
deal and hopes to obtain satisfactory evidence for prosecu-
tion of SCHLAR, |

DARDIS is a new Chief of Police at North Bay Vil-
| Jrace and a former New York state trooper. SAMUEL SCHLAR —~ > ;

The "Miami Herald" newspaper of January 24, 1958, ae
reported that lie detector tests were ordered for five mem- ae
bers of the Coral Gables Traffic Bureau on January 23, 1958,
after a discrepancy of $10.00 was noted pbetwéen the amount
turned in to the Traffic Bureau and the amount paid by an
: individual, who violat a traffic ordinance. The article
i related that RICHARD N.KRACO of Miami violated a traffic
: BOHALD HA RQOOD produce receipt for $35.00 written. by

 

DONALD M, OLEY, Coral Gables Police Department, on a ;
slip of. ‘in white paper. RACO was skeptical of the re- :
ceipt because it was not written on’a printed receipt form. -
i The receipt was charged against the summons on file at the t

| Police Department and it was found that only a $25.00

fine was recorded. The -article indicated that there was ,
evidence of erasure on the ticket in the Police Department, ‘
which altered the offense from driving sixty miles an
hour in a twenty-five mile zone, to fifty miles an hour.
{This article pointed out that. the penalty for a sixty
mile violation. was. $35.00 and the penalty for a fifty mile
violation was $25.00.
