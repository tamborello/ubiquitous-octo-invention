Dear Chairman Tunheim:

My colleagues and I very much appreciate your letter
of May 14th, in which you comment positively on the working
relationship between our staff and the Review Board and
staff. :

We, too, regard the relationship as positive. For
example, the Board’s willingness to discuss issues with the
Agency's representatives has been very helpful. David Marwell,
Jeremy Gunn, and Mary McAuliffe deserve a good deal of credit
for fostering constructive communications between our staffs.

Again, thank you for your thoughtful comments. You can
be assured that we will continue to take very seriously the
responsibility for releasing as many assassination records
as possible.

Sincerely,

oo,
