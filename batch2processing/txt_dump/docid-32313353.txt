ACCESS OF SUBJECT TO IN ORMATION AT THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND _ DEVELOPMENT
On July 14, 1958, the Office of Security,
Department of State, advised that on July 1, 1958, it had ©.
been determined from the International Bank for Reconstruc- .
tion and Development that DAJANY is a loan operations officer
employed in the Department of Operations for the Far East.
The subject's duties are concerned primarily with Thailand
and occasionally other Far East countries. The subject
does not handle any information in the course of his normal
duties that would be of interest to the Israeli Government,
either from an intelligence or economic point of view./S)

 

   
 

 

It was ascertained that the business of the bank .

does. not deal with any information which would be classified :
because of a national security interest. It was learned
that certain information is administratively controlled
and available only to staff members of the bank. . It was 1
explained, however, that the administratively controlled
material is available to the general public through various
other sources, The bank restricts its information

only because of a desire to release the information at a
particular time. The subject would have access to the

files throughout the various departments of the bank but

would have no cause to utilize these files in his position. (S)

On July 14, 1958, the Office of ‘Security was |

advised that a thorough search of all records of the various ;

departments of the bank failed to disclose that DAJANY had |
withdrawn any files outside of the normal course of his .

_ duties, To the knowledge of the State Department's source,
the bank maintains no information which would be of interest
to. the Israeli Government from an economic or intelligence :
viewpoint. (6 os oe

‘'. CHAMOUN, President of Lebanon; CHARLES MALIK, Foreign
Minister of Lebanon, and NURI EL SAID (former Premier of
Iraq and now deceased). ($s) oe : an

.. .,  :In indicating his acquaintances, DAJANY complained i
that he was cut off from any of his acquaintances at home
and cursed the people.in Jordan who had cut him off. DAJANY
indicated he had no political future in Jordan and yet he
still had many friends. DAJANY described ROUSAN as being
the same caliber as many of his acquaintances, but felt ROUSAN
was even. superior because ROUSAN was bold and courageous.
DAJANY advised he would foresake whatever wealth and positim
he might have at some future time and would look forward to
someone like ROUSAN with whom he could co-operate and work
all over again in the interest of, Jordan.(S)

; ; According to.the informant, ROUSAN indicated he ; ;
was loyal to the King of Jordan and would challenge anyone
who was close to the King to prove their loyalty to the
King was greater than his. own. ROUSAN felt that persons !
around the King had talked and intrigued against him, and
that there is also gossip about, him in Washington. ROUSAN DE
blamed YOUSUFHAIKAL or TAYSIRMTOUKAN for reporting that im

ROUSAN was in contact.with~"uridesirable persons." According Jonbee
; to ROUSAN, information concerning his contagt with undesirab e AOR EES
persons had come to him from Amman, Jordan S) .

; ROUSAN was not acquainted too well with the source
ef the information, however, some individual had contacted
ROUSAN after seeing the King of Jordan, and this. person was
made to understand by the King that ROUSAN had exceeded _ *
proper bounds and special regulations. ROUSAN contradicted ;
this, however, by stating that the King himself had! requested '
ROUSAN write him, and as a consequence, ROUSAN had. written -
directly to the King. ROUSAN felt his whole case was wrapped
up with the King and not with anyone else, and ROUSAN felt
that writing to the King, an acquaintance, did not exceed
proper bounds. Also-the King, according to ROUSAN's source,
had reproached ROUSAN because of information reaching him
that ROUSAN was in contact with undesirable persons. ROUSAN
was not able to plain who "undesirable persons" were or
what it meant.(&) :
