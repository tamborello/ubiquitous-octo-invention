under orders of subject to locate buyer for arms. Garcia was to
look for legitimate proposition and then turn matter over to. subject.
Garcia did not know where subject intended to get the arms but
surmised they would come {rem Europe. Jt is noted Garcia had. been in
touch ith [the Doniniewnsqey

Investigation has also disclosed that subject is official
of Servicios Internacionales, Ss Ac, @ Panananian Corporations.
Edward Browder, Jre, is also affiliated with this Corporation.
Browder was convicted of violation of Neutrality Act in late 1940's
and was convicted in June, 1959, and April, 1960, in connection with
the receiving of over $136,000 in stolen Canadian bonds. Browder is
presently out on bond pending appeals of these convictions.

On 6+30-59 subject appeared before Senate Select Committee
on Improper Management in the Labor and Management Field. Subject's
attorney requested Committee to dismiss subject as witness since
subject was then under indictment for conspiring to smuggle arms.
Committee granted request. :

Subject has also been allegedly associated with various
enterprises in Cleveland and Toledo, Ohio, with hoodlums and racket
figures. Included among these is; Louis "Babe" Trisearo, noted
Cleveland labor racketeer and William Joseph Conrad. Conrad was ~
sentenced in 1959, to 18 months tn Federal Penitentiary for selling
$50,000 of worthless uranium stocks to Toledo residents. Subject
was President of uranium company. One source in February, 1960,
advised subject claimed to have been bondsman for Frank Costello
and other such racketeers. Source commented he did not believe
anyone who so acted would ever talk about it, and in his opinion
whatever subject said could be discounted about 99 per cent.

 

Subject's identification record, FBI Number 440 734 6
(copy attached) shows arrest in 1956 for issuing checks with
insufficient funds as well as arrest for arms smuggling. We have -
furnished copies of reports concerning subject to Department,
Customs, as well as to other interested agencies.

Discussion of subject's possible criminal activities with
Departmental Attorney will not affect our inquiries and there is no

objection to such discussion.
