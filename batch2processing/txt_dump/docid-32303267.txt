am 2 : CONFIREN PIAL wee

it is observedxthek as of Getober, 1955, Pittman
wes employed as Foreign Editor for the "Daily Worker” and

"The Worker,” having been’ sé’ euployed since April 24, 19651.

He was previously Associate Editor of the “Baily Worker"

and "fhe Worker.” tie reportedly attended a meeting in 54
Europe in 1946 with William 2. Foster and French Communis
leaders. An Glleged Comintern representative also reportedly
attended this meeting.) Pittman attended the 1950 convention

of the Communist Part heid in December, 1950, at New York City
and he wos elected to the convention's Press Committee. In
September, 1951, Pittman covered the San Francisco Japanese
Peace Treaty Conference for the "Datly Worker” and the

"Daily People’s World." He has been an instructor for the
Jefferson School of Social Sctence since 1949 and has written
for the publications "People's Voice," “Jewish Life,” and
"Nasses and Mainstream." He has been a speaker at Communist
Party meetings.

  

In view of Pittman's close Communist affiliations
over @ period of years and his present employment with the
"Daily Worker," there appears to be no reason ta believe
he would be cooperative. An interview with him at this time
is not contemplated.

The information in the preceding two paragraphs has
also been furnished to the Atomic Energy Commission.
