also sent the source to JIMMY HOFFa, Informant advised that
since DOYLE originally put him in with the group to secure
Teamster mortgages, he has promised DOYLE a piece of every
mortgage.

  

Informant advised that the deal with GIAMONCA
is not completed. The mortgage commitment is completed, but
GIAMONCA has only a temporary license from the State of NJ
to operate a hospital and the Teamsters will not furnish the Fi
money until such time as GIaAMONCaA can get a permanentblicense.
He said that the hospital is built and operating on temporary
mortgage money furnished by the Chase Manhattan Bank, but it
is absolutely essential that GIAMONCaA obtain a permanent
license in order to get the Teamster loan to repay the bank.
Informant advised that even if the deal fell through, GIAMONCA
would not be able to get back the commissions paid in advance
since all of the other individuals operated in good faith

with his wife over custody and visiting privileges with his

extremely difficult for the. contacting Agents to meet with

that all matters currently not fully explained or developed

Re: WILBUR/CLARK, and /chateau DeVille, Apartments,

oS fi ;
Informant advised that he spoke to_DA ENGER and
gave him $2,000 because WENGER, who had receive > m
the informant a short time ago, told the informant that he

thought there was $10,000 in the envelope and told JIMMY

HOFFA that he was coming to Washington with $10,000, Informant
told WENGER that he was sorry there was a misunderstanding,

but thought at the time he gave this money to WENGER on 6/20/63,
that he made it clear to WENGER that the envelope contained
$5,000 and not $10,000,

During the course of their discussion, informant
told WENGER that he had been offered a deal by WILBUR CLARK's
associates to get a Teamster mortgage for the Chateau DeVille
Apartments in Las Vegas. WENGER told him that there was no
' chance of the informant making any money on this deal since

; WILBUR CLARK had already received a prior commitment from the

Teamsters in the amount of $3,300,000, which he had not used
: and it has been decided to use the money from this commitment
of to finance the Chateau DeVille Apartments. WENGER commented
‘ that he could not understand why the WILBUR CLARK people
contacted the informant since they have "a direct deal with
JIMMY HOFFA."

 

Re: DAVE WENGER

Source advised that WENGER has an interest in the
money presently on deposit in his bank in Nassau and the
i informant is currently giving WENGER money he is obtaining
from new potential deals, such as the SAMUEL IVES deal. In
this manner he anticipates getting WENGER's full cooperation
on the new deals and if for some reason these deals do not go
through, he will return the money to the clients out of the
\ amount now on deposit in the Nassau bank. WENGER suggested to
VY the informant that/if he is going to Chicago, he should get in
I “ touch with MORRIS#EMANUEL. Informant reminded WENGER that

- because he has not received any money. He said that if he

\ owing to WENGER. WENGER suggested that the informant give
MORRIS EMANUEL $500. :
