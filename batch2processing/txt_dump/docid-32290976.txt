Illona Marita Lorenz claimed Fidel Castro
was responsible for her pregnancy after she lived
with him several months during the Summer of 1959
She claimed she was drugged and an abortion performed
by Castro's henchmen and, thereafter, she fled Cuba.’ *
and returned to her home in New York City. ‘*Her Bake ee
mother wrote many government leaders through ut t
world soliciting action against Fidel Castro and an
article concerning the affair dppeared in a "scandal~-
type" magazine, Miss Lorenz claims Pelletier came to’
New York City, trying to marry her and wlso trying :
to take her back to Cuba. She refused to have any-
thing to do with Pelletier and he reportedly made
@ second trip to New York City on 3/11/60 and asked
her to accompany him to Mexico, On this occasion,
subject accused her of causing him to lose favor with |
Castro and said Castro had forced subject to divorce
his wife in Cuba and ordered him to marry Miss Lorena.
New York Office, when.told by Miss Lorenz that subject
attacked her when she declined to accompany him to
Mexico, instructed her to report this to New York City
Police Department (NYC PD), which she did. WNYC PD
had subject report to police station where he
identified himself as a military aide to Castro and
exthibited his diplomatic passport. Miss Lorenz fatled
to press charges against subject and the charges were
dismissed as NYC PD was reluctant aet against subject
because of his diplomatic statuse bject has potential
; , as source of information concerning Castro if he is —
; . in disfavor with Castro and possibility (6 he

 

 

might defect while he is in Mextcos « Kz (73)
