: Regarding Lead #4, inquiry in the vicinity of ‘
the Standard 011 Station at 4420 N.W. 7th Avenue reflects |
. this station is operated by Cubans ‘and that almost all business:
is with Cuban exiles. ‘In an effort to obtain some coverage
on this station on the possibllity that the SNFE is obtaining
‘gasoline there, Mr. RAY STAMPER, owner of the Amoco Station
on the opposite corner, has been contacted as a source in this

regard. STAMPER is most cooperative, anti-Cuban, and stated
he will immediately contact the office when he observes
large amounts of gasoline being purchased from this station.
STAMPER said that on several occastons in the past he had
observed as many as six 55-gallon drums being loaded and

transported from the station during the

course of one day by

individuals whom he considered to be Cubans. No direct
contact will be made with the proprietor of the Standard

Station at this time.

; [Regarding the information furnished by CIA concerning
alleg surveillance by FBI, it is to be noted that the only,
surveilla: conducted by Miami has been the spot check of 3
SNFE‘ boats.| Mention by RAMON QUESADA of the bank account of
SNFE indicates that CARLOS ARBOLEYA, cashier at the Boulevard
Bank, advised SNFE of our inquiry. It 1s noted ARBOLEYA is

a Cuban friend of VECIANA.
