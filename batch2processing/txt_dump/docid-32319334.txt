Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am writing on behalf of Director Louis J. Freeh to
inform you of the status of the FBI’s response to the "President
John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992"
(the Act), and to provide projections regarding completion of the
work that remains to be done pursuant to the Act. This letter
reiterates much of the information conveyed to Ms. Diane Merritt
of the staff of the Regulation and Government Information
Subcommittee (RGIS) by FBI JFK Task Force Director Terry T.
O’Connor in a meeting on June 16, 1994, and a telephone
conversation on June 20, 1994.

The FBI has been committed to a speedy and full
response to the Act and, to date, has transferred 463,395 pages
of JFK documents to the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA). This represents almost half of the nearly
one million pages of assassination-related documents that the
Task Force can now estimate have been in FBI files. The files
that have been transferred include all Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack
Ruby, "related subjects" (e.g. Marina Oswald), and Warren
Commission files, as well as files on the investigation of
President Kennedy’s Assassination that were maintained at FBI
Headquarters and in the FBI’s Dallas and New Orleans Field

Offices.
