4, As you may know, an Agency task force has been
conducting an in-depth study of ail information relating to
issues surrounding the Agency's support for the Warren
Commission investigation. This study has been underway
since early July and, because of the detailed nature of the
review, May require as much as another two months if it
is to be completed with the thoroughness that we believe

necessary.

5.

OLC on 2 August called Liebengood of Senator Baker's

staff in response to a query concerning Jack Ruby's alleged

trip to Cuba. Unfortunately, on the basis of inadequately
researched information given OLC, that staff admitted to
knowing only about an allegation of a 1963 trip to Cuba by

Ruby put out as propaganda by an anti-Castro Cuban group.

The information did not include information in CIA's possession
on the 1959 trip by Ruby contained in the 1963 (Tab A) cable.
Madigan finally received from OLC a copy of the 1963 cable

on September 15, when the matter was straightened out and

the files properly researched.

6. As a relevant note on the question on whether or not
the Agency was purposely withholding the 1963 cable on Ruby's
1959 visit, we have been informed by the FOIA staff that at

least the following persons have been

cable:

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM : John H. Waller
: Inspector General
SUBJECT :

Jack Anderson Reference to 28 November
1963 CIA Cable :

1, The Operations Group of CI Staff has provided a copy
of the cable about which you inquired, A copy is attached at

Tab A. It is a dissemination of a report by a British journalist _

stating that a man named Ruby was in Cuba in 1959, where he
visited an American gangster-gambler named "Santos, " who
was living luxuriously in jail. This dissemination was based
on a 27 November 1963 cable from London, a copy of which is.
attached at Tab B. A follow-up cable from London on

29 November commented:on the source of the storv, raising
a question as to his reliability, A copy is at Tab C. A more
detailed statement about the man is contained in a report
passed to the FBI on 12 December 1963, a copy of which is

at Tab D.

2. On 7 January 1964 the FBI provided CIA with a report
that Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in 1959; a copy is at Tab E.
On 30 January CIA provided additional information to the
Bureau on this subject; a copy is at Tab F.

3. The following points of coincidence are probably of
interest to Senator Baker: Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in
1959, as stated in the report that gave rise to the present
query; the name "Santos" is also the given name of Trafficante,
although it is not clear that these are the same persons. While
there are reservations about the reliability of the source of
the report which gave rise to the present question, we are not
in a position at this time to evaluate it definitively. It is noted
that the description of ''Santos" as living in luxury in a Cuban
prison is similar to a version also reported in a 16 May 1974
story in the Outlook Section of the Washington Post.

7. As discussed with you, I think it would be useful for
my staff, specifically Breckinridge, to get Madigan out here,
describe to him our task force approach to the problem and
otherwise convince him that we are cooperating to the fullest
on this problem. We will coordinate this with OLC.

John ‘H. Walle
