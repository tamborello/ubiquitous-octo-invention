NOTE FOR: - All Historical Review Group Members

SUBJECT: Procedure--JFK Assassination Review/Congressionally-
Originated Documents

We have been requested by the Office of Congressional
Affairs (OCA) to institute special handling for Congressionally-
originated documents that appear in the JFK Assassination
Collection that HRG is reviewing. Specifically, OCA asks that we
segregate such documents and retain them, rather than send them
to the National Archives, at least for the time being. ‘Examples
of such documents would be letters to the DCI from HSCA Chairman
Stokes, notes taken by HSCA staffers, etc. (This is subject to
change once the Agency has received instructions from Congress. )

Therefore, we are to implement the following procedure for
congressionally-originatea documents:

- Remove the document from the box, substituting’ a
withdrawal card in the box.

- Review the document for Agency equities and so note them,
leaving the document intact.

- Retain the document in a separate, temporary file,
recording the box in which the document was located.
