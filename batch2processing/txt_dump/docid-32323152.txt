On 7/3/63 SA JAMES P, HOSTY, JR., received,
a. handwritten report, dated 7/2/63, from DL-6-S, who has furnished
reliable information in the past. This report has been serialized
as 134-1A-766,
Informant determined on 7/2/63 that on that date JOE

LANDIN attended the American G. I. Forum meeting. The forun
members were interested in the newly revived organization, League
of United Latin American Citizens. They thought it similar to the .
forum in its goals and also wondered why it was being revived at °
this time - after being dormant for so many years. LANDIN told
the ménithat he had learned from the Lulac president that locally
Lulac was trying to undermine PASO by infiltrating PASO and setting
up @ chairman ef Lulac's choice. In the meantime, PASO's chairman
had joined Lulac to keep abreast of what they did, LANDIN said he .
wished those conditions would not lead to a squabble that would
render both organizations powerless, .

; Forum members, LANDIN learned, did not want to dabble in. --
politics, they felt the majority of the people did not either.
They are leery of the Teamsters and claim racial discrimination is
lessening to the point where they receive no complaints from victims.
LANDIN made a motion to give “Among the Valient" the book of
Mexican-Americans in World War II and the Korean Conflict, to the
Dallas Public Library. An amendment was made to give two books c:.
instead of one, the other book to a library branch. The motion was
passed. They, the men’s forum, will pass out folders on the forum
and may have a mass meeting to acquire funds to give a scholarship.
An Ennis resident, a young lady, plans te start a forum there late in
July. She will receive help from the Dallas forum. LANDIN and
OROZCO will help her place an ad in the Ennis newspaper announcing -
the forum's first meeting there. LANDIN will also help in making. Se
i up the information folder, (information on the forum, whom to contact,

ete.,)that is to be distributed to the public. ;
