Becatise it has been developed, as outlined above,

that) the Internal Revenue Service cannot be -trusted-even with -
‘paraphrased information from the above three sources, the

Philadelphia Division is setting forth information as developed .

- \by these sources in a separate communication. This is a.

necessity as previous experience has indi¢ated that Departmental
torney THOMAS MC BRIDE maintains a close relationship with
the Internal Revenue Service in Philadelphia in regard to the |
investigation of ANGELO BRUNO and other allied matters, and .
would possibly furnish information from these. confidential

  

sources to the Internal Revenue Service even though the Phila-. .

delphia Division.’ ‘has not been disseminating this type of
information to, the Internal Revenue Service in Philadelphia.

; Th. the event that Internal Revenue Service, Philadel-
phia, Pa, requests dissemination in report form or any

- portions of a report by the FBI in regard to ANGELO BRUNO,
“UACB, they will be advised by the Philadelphia Division that .

this information will be available only at the Bureau at

“Washington, D. C,

4

A point of interest in this regard is the fact that
Internal Revenue Service Agent JOHN CHIOVERO, during the week
of 2/4-10/62,. has telephonically contacted SA J, ROBERT PEARCE
‘for the first. time in over a two month period for no apparent
reason,: which could be contributed to lend a support to the
possibility that CHIOVERO is working with LOUIS PERSICHETTI

in an endeavor to sell information to BRUNO,
