Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan
Re: Burglary of FBI Resident Agency
Media, Pennsylvania, 3-8~71
eee ‘s +
' With respect to the proposed Camden break-in, it was

recognized from the outset that secrecy was imperative-~both from
the ‘standpoint of protecting our source who has successfully
associated himself to a very close degree with Grady and, more
‘important, insuring there be no leak which would scare off Grady
and his group. By memoranda June 28 and July 7, 1971, we pointed
out the importance of keeping these plans confidential, it being
imperative that there be no dissemination outside the FBI at this
time. It is SAC Moore's recommendation we not alert at this time
any agencies having an interest and/or located in the Post Office
Building. This would include General Services Administration, the
military, Selective Service, and Postal authorities. To do so might
result in activity which could very weil alert the alleged ‘
perpetrators who are very sensitive to any unusual activity and
who have the Post Office under surveillance.

 

It should be noted the Internal Security Division of the
Department has requested it be advised of all matters having any
possible connection with the Berrigan group. None of the individuals
known to. be planning participation in the Camden break-in are among
those indicted with Berrigan in the Eastcon case. Nevertheless, it
appears persons associated with the Berrigan group are involved in
the planning of the Camden break~in and all seem to. be inextricably
intertwined in the Berrigan and Eastcon philosophies.

It is also noted that in a memorandum dated March 29, 1971,
the Internal Security Division indicated, in view of the interest
of that Division in those individuals associated with Hastcon and
the Berrigan supporters, they desired the Media case be handled in
its entirety by the Special Litigation Section of the Internal
Security Division. They also requested that in addition to
communications, all prosecutive presentations should be made to the
Special Litigation Section.

ACTION: In view of the above developments. indicating a tentative
action date for July 25, 1971, it is recommended this matter. be
presented at this time to the Special Litigation Section well in
advance of the target date in order that there can be no question
concerning the propriety of our proposed action. The Bureau
obviously must fulfill its responsibilities in this case which

might involve the apprehension of from 15 to 25 individuals in the
commission of the intended break-in of the Post Office Building.

In order to preclude as much as possible any unforeseen difficulties,

It was recommended and approved that no action be taken along’ these ©

This is to summarize the current status of our inves-
tigation of captioned matter and to consider future plans in
;connection with, the development of information indicating a planned

| [peeks at the-Post_ Office Building, Camden, New_ Jersey, scheduled

for July 25, 1971.

John Peter Grady, a close associate of the Berrigan
| prothers, according to several sources, claims to have planned and
| participated in the Media burglary. He was allegedly assisted by
i Fathers Joseph O'Rourke, Peter Fordi, and Edward McGowan. In
addition, at least three other alleged associates of the Berrigan

group are believed to have participated. Through information .
{recently developed, Grady has been pinpointed as the individual .

who masterminded at least 14 of the 18 break-ins of various A,

Government facilities during the past two years. He currently [7

heads up what is termed the “action group" and is reported
reliably as being a staunch advocate of "hits" on Federal
facilities as a means of embarrassing the Federal Government.

During the past several weeks, we have been successful

hich is presently planning a break-in of the draft board office
with alternate targets being Military Intelligence and the FBI

it would be delayed until July 25, 1971, in order to allow elements

{4 direction of SAC Roy K. Moore, on special Medburg assignment, with
| the cooperation of SACs, Philadelphia and Newark, arrangements have
been perfected aimed at apprehending these individuals red~handed.
Hopefully, O'Rourke, Fordi, and McGowan will participate in the
Camden break-in as well as others involved in the Media burglary.
