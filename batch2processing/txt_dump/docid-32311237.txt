WALTER WILSON JENKINS
Src

; (Ss WP 1409-g#)on 10/16/64, learned that WALTER
TROHAN>} Chicage Tribune, while at the Mexican Embassy, i

discussed with RUSS (ph) a story which he, TROHAN, had

written concerning Secret Service action with respect

to the FBI record of JENKINS! arrest. The discussion

Was prompted by a report received by RUSS to the effect

that the New York Times will publish an account which differs

with that reported by TROHAN,

 

The Times, according to RUSS, will say that the
Secret Service admitted they did not send on to the White
House the arrest of JENKINS because they did not think
it was important. For that. reason, he wanted to know
whether any change was necessary in TROHAN's account.
TROHAN, in reply, stated RUSS could tell them that WLEY,
a great friend of his, told him as a routine matter it was
sent there, it could be assumed it was sent there if it
eoncerned the President or Vice President of the U, S..
However, TROHAN continued, “they wouldn't say that on
the record, nor when the investigation comes through, being
under the control of the President are they going to put
the heat under the White House.” TROHAN added that he has
known ROWLEY since the day he joined the“Secret Service. _
Last week, ROWLEY wrote a noted to TROHAN thanking him for

report. Consequently, he would tell TROHAN the truth but
