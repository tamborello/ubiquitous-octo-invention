Re: JOM PITHAN
SECURLTY Mav

 

Dear Sir:

‘re G. 7. Wetnered of NI-5 has asked that T obtain from
tne Bureau any information they may have on an American jourmalist
named JOHN PIG: who is believed to be a correspondent of the
New York "Daily Worker," and who has recently been touring
Rurope in that capacity. According to vr. Vethered, he is said to
be a member of the American Communist Party and is certainly in
touch with Communists in the United States. It is believed that
he is editor of a Party paper in San Francisco. He recently re-
turned to *nsland from Poland and is believed to have been in
London during March of this year 6S)

   

Mr. Vethered also stated PITMAN was said to be manifesting
_ considerable interest in the doings of an American official named
DALLAS. DALLAS is said to be a high executive on the economic
side in the American Zone of %ermany. &)

I would appreciate receiving at the earliest possible
date any information the Eureau may have on subject PITMAN and
his present work, and if known the length of his stay on the

  

Continent.
Very truly yours,
J. A. Cimperman ,
Legal Attache.
