T-3 stated that from information he had
learned, it was definite that BRUNO could direct the
activities of SAILOR and tell SAILOR whomhe should turn
his numbers into, He said that he was told that SAILOR
did not want to associate with CHARLES, apparently
CHARLES COSTELLO, as this would take 50 per cent of

SAILOR's profits and that SAILOR did not like COSTELLO
because COSTELLO had a mean temper. T-3 said it was
also indicated that SAILOR did not want to have a "time
clock" in his office, which T-3 believed was a machine
to receive race horse results. SAILOR did not want this
activity because there was no escape in the event of a>
police raid as the machines would be evidence, whereas
in the numbers operation, he could hide the papers.

T-3 said also that SAILOR believed that he was not in

the good graces of BRUNO because he had promised BRUNO

during a recent meeting thathe would reaffiliate with
CHARLES, with whom SAILOR had severed relations approxi- ‘
mately three years ago in December. T-3 said that

BRUNO told SAILOR's son got out of line.

interest in a vending machine business and music machine
jusiness, which was a combined operation with offices in

Vending Company, 1504 Alton Road, Miami Beach, Fla., who,
