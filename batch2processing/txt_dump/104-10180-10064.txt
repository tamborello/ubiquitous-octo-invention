go that be could be back in San Juan before the 25th

with IDEN A. Further there ig no firm evidence thad
IDEN ¢ ia against the present regime in PERUMEN. IDEN D

wngupported allegations there is no independent

firm evidence that IDEN D is anti-regiae.

5. IDEN A aleo claimed in Madrid that

8 potential ally. He explained this in San Juan *

by sayang that during a prese conference his name .

considéred 2DEN A to be his friend. IDEN A rationalized
“that if IDEN E had not wanted to indicate in some way
that he waa ‘with’ IDEN A he would have taken this

opportunity to blast hia.

intentions generally betore I introduced hin to

foe three of us had a mesting acd it was agreed that
IDEN A would keep AMBADGER/1 ccapletely informed of
his plans and that AKBADGER/i would convey them to
me in PBPRIME. IDEN A refused to reveal the
identities of hig agents inside PERUMZN deapite strong
pressure. He algo stated that IDEN F and IDEN G would.
have to knoy about his arrangenent with AMDADGER/1

IDEN A, are the triumvirate of the JURE.
