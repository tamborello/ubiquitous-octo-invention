Mr. Halpern. To the DDP.

Mr. Johnston. That was Mr.Helms at the time.

Mr. Halpern. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Did he also report to Mr. Cane, J. C. Cane?

Mr. Halpern. Oh, no, no, no, there was nothing like that.
It was taken completely out of the divisional, regional lines
of command and made a special staff.

Senator Schweiker. There was nothing that related to
Cuba, Cuban activity. or anti-Castro activity, after that was
done, that went. through: the formally normal channel.

Mr. Halpern. Only in regard to seeking the help of the
Western Hemisphere Division and its stations, to help us in
our activities. Obviously Cuba was still part of the Western
Hemisphere geographically, and you need to have help, for
example, if we are going to send people from TFW or SAS into
Mexico or into Venezuela, you had to get permission of the
holding division. $o in that regard we had an awful lot of
work to do with and constant liaison and communication with the
Western Hemisphere Division, the same kind of activity we had
with other divisions such as Europe, where we had quite:a bit
of.activity in Spain because of the Cuban refugees in Spain.

But most of it was at that time obviously with the Western

Mr. Johnston. ~ Did.SAS in the:fall of 1963 have any of its

own people in Mexico City?

Mr. Halpern. Yes. How many, I don't know, but we did have
some that were attached to the station there, under the station
command.

The staff had no authority to break the chains of command,
and everything that was communicated to and from the SAS
assignees anywhere else in the world went through WH Division
here in Washington, and they saw the replies when it came from
the station.

Mr. Johnston. Do you recall whether Mr. David Phillips was
one of the SAS people in Mexico City?

Mr. Halpern. No, I do not.

Mr. Johnston. You do not recall?

Mr. Halpern. I do not recall.

Mc. Johnston: Who provided counterintelligence support
to the Special Affairs Staff?

Mr. Halpern. We had our own small counterintelligence
staff. i believe, if memory serves me, it was headed up some
during this period by Hal Swenson, who is a Cl specialist, ane
we always had, of course, the support of the CI Staff of the vi
under Mr. Angleton. -

But basically each of the divisions in this case, it was

in effect a division, even though it was called a staff, had. owt
