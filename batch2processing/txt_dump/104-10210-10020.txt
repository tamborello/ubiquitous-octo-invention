the KGB c idered PREISFREUND corpromised to American
Intelligence after GOLITSYN's ection [in December 1961}
thus unsuitable for further use against Americans at the FEm~-
bassy in Mescow. For is reason, NOSENKO was told to take
PREISTREUND with hin when he transferred to the Seventh De-
partment. As the agent spoke only Finnish and Russian, however,
he was of no use against English-speaking tourists. NOSENKO

who was [erroneousiy) considered to be a CIA officer.
SRHAKHOY "maybe" had some contact with MARK in 1966 or 1¢
but NOSENKO did not know the substance of it. A cour
intelligence officer of the First Chief Directorate,
GOLUBEV, hid cace been on a delegation with. SHAKHOV and
had noted "Little details". While SHAKHOY was in the v
States, earlier, he had been terminated fas an agent]
KGB officers who had submitted a report stating that SH
liked life in the Unites States, American products,
money. in that KGB report he was Cepicted as "not yocd”
and ‘nut wanting to work as an agent".

  
    
 
 
 

 

NOSENKO stated chat SHAKHOV had served with the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs in the United States and that during that
service he acted as an aqent-recruiter for the KGB. SHAZHOV
was permitted to travel abroad even though suspected ci being
an American agent, because he belonaed to the Ministry o£
Foreign Affairs, and “the KGB could do nothing about his
trips abroad’. “There was no proof, only suspicions, and \
furthermore, SHAKHCY was a member of the personal staff of : |

i

 

the head of the Soviet delegation, S.K. Tsarapkin." According
to NOSENKO, SHAKIIOY was not and never had been a KGB officer.

 

Comment :. SHAKHOV has served in and visited the United

States since 1942, when he was assigned to the

Soviet Consulate General in New York. He at-

tended the 1945 Conference on International

Organization in San Francisco, and he had at-

tended a number of sessions of the UN General

AssemLiy. Most recently SHAKHOV was assigned

to the U.S. in 1963 as a member of the Soviet

Missica to the UN. KGB officer RASTVOROV 1¢en-

tified him as an MVD [KGB] officer whom he is

certain he saw at MVD Headquarters in Moscow,
identified him as “an employee of the
KGB": and KGB defectors PETROV and DERYABIN

have reported that from a photograph, SHAKKOV's

_ face “was familiar“. An FBI source, however, vam es
in 1964 said that SHAKHOV was a “pure diplomat”
and that to his knowledge, SHAKHOV had engaged
in no Soviet intelligence activity until that
time. . : aa

A sensitive source two

foe has crotedsKG38 of Fic:
respectively, as stating NOSENKD joined the KGB in 1947
or 1949.

   

The significance of NOSENKO's BU service is the fact
chat ne claims it launched his tntelligence.career and
served as the means through whi he secured appointment
to the HGR aiter once having be rejected. The two or more
years he claim am to have serveé in the RU represent a
significant :pi of. his adult fe. for which he should
have ro aiffiezlty accounting. nally, the date of his
actual transfer from the Naval to the KGB is critical to
Getermining the time from which his claims about KG3 service
ean Le judged credible.

 
 
  
  
 

 

 

  
 

 

 

NOSENKO volunteered extensive comment on his Naval RU
service at his first meetings with CIA in 1962. After his
19€4 defection, it was the tepic on which he made one of
his initial retractions and his first admission that he had
earlier made a false clain i@ subject of his Naval RU
service was consequently prominent in interrogations in
1964, 1965 and 1966. However,
challenges of nis assertions abcut his RU service prompted
adjustments in his claimed dats of graduation from the
Institute or claimed date of enzry into the KGB, just as
challenges’cn those latter tepics prompted amended: state-
Ments with resrect to his RU service. The extent of the
still-unreconciled discrepancies and centradictions in
NOSENKO's various accounts is best perceived in comparison
of his statements made in 1962, 1964, 1965 and 1966.

   

 
   

 

NOSENKO's Infermation-1942

NOSENKO. finished the Institute of International Relations
in 1950 and immediately reporte? for duty with the RU.
{He did not amplify how he drew such an assignment. } In
SeptenLer 1950 hé was offered 25 signments in Leningrad,
Moscow, and in the Far East, ane he chose the Far East "so
no one would think he would take advantage of his father's”

 

. position". He was assigned to a radio signals interception

unit in Sovetskaya Gavan" (on the Soviet coast opposite
Sakhalin), where he collected Grder of Battle information by
monitoring the communications of American units operating in

NOSENKO has said at various times that the Institute
course was of four years' duration and that he entered the
Naval RU on graduation in 1949; that it was four years’
duration and that Lecause he failed a state examination he
was graduated later, in 1950; that it was of five years'
curation and he gvaduated in 1950, on schedule; and that it
was of £:ve years' duration but he failed an examination
which delayed his yraduation for three months.

 

Comrent: See p.3e7 for report that NOSPNKO joined the KG"
upon graduation from the Institute in 1947.
The duration of the Institute course and the
Gate of NUSILNFO's completion are material to
the plausibility of his’ claimed Naval PU service,
which: ne said followed almost immediately upoa
his departure from the Institute.

 

 

Naval RU Service (ca. 1951 - ca. 1953)

NOSENKO claims that upon completion of his studies at
the Institute of International Relations he entered the
Naval RU, serving in the Far Fast and then in a Baltic post,
finally successfully “transferring” to the KGB through the
intervention of his father's friend, KGB General KOBULOY.
A sensitive source

is the sole source also asserting that NOSENKO

served in the RU. According tagg NOSENKO attendé@™ his
the Military-Diplomatic Academy an
Information Department for about a year before securing a
transfer to the KGR through his father's influence. NOZENKO
denies having attended the Military-Diplomatic Academy and
has never claimed service in the RU Information (Rerorts)
Department, although he had on occasion claimed to have held
Reports assignments. -

Baku), where he finished the Eighth Class in spring, 1943.
In a second version [more probable since entry to the Moscow
Special Naval €chool required prior completion of the .
Seventh Class] NOSENKO said that when the war broke out he
and his mother were evacuated to Chelyabinsk, where he
completed the Seventh Class in summer of 1942. They returned
to Moscow afterwards, and NOSENKO was then enrolled in the
Moscow Speciai Naval School (then in Kuybyshev) where he
completed the Eighth Class in 1943; in the fall o. 1943
NOSENKO was enrolled in the Leningrad Naval Preparatory
School (then in Baku).

After just six months in Baku, without completing the
Ninth Class, OSENKO ran away from school and returned to
Moscow.

Comment: NOSENKO has asserted variously that he ran
away and fought on the front at Tuapse, and
that he had finished the Tenth Class in Baku
and then spent the period 1943-1945 at the
Frunze Higher Naval School, the equivalent of
Annapolis. He. has retracted both assertions.

NOSENKO completed the Ninth Class in June 1944 at the
Moscow Mining Institute, and when the Leningrad Naval
Preparatory School returned to Leningrad from Baku,.he
resumed his studies there. Early in 1945, however, NOSENKO
received a gunshot wound in the hand, and after being
hospitalized for a month, he left the Naval school.

Comment: NOSENKO has claimed both that he was shot by
a jealous naval officer whom he then protected

‘ by stating that the wound was self-inflicted,
and that he actually did accidently shoot him=

the effect "KO shot nimself to avoid
being sent to the front while attending” a naval
college in 1942. .

Comment: (Continued)
After NCSENKO's defection was publicized,
Sovjet Naval defector ARTAMONOV volurteered
to CIA that he had known the son’of the
Minister NOSENKO in the naval schooi in
Leningrad from 1944 to 1946.

NOSENKO completed the Tenth Class at the Leningrad Srip-
building Tekhnikum in dune 1945, and he successfully passed
the necessary examinations to qualify him for entrance to
the Mcscow Institute of International Relations that summer.

Birth to 1945: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO is virtually the sole source of information on
his early life. However, this portion of his claimed
biography is consistent with the NOSENKO family's where-
abouts as publicized in press accounts at the time cf his
father's death in 1956, and with the existence of the
schools he claims to have attended.

Allowing for exaggerated claims of boyhood heroics
(fighting at the front, attending the Frunze Academy, and
formal induction in and discharge from the Navy), all of
which NOSENKO has retracted under interrogation, NOSENKO's
claimed identity as the son of Minister Ivan I. NOSENKO
and the substance of his claims about his life uati! 1945
are accepted as true. . 7 .

(FOUNDATIONS GF KOSENKO'S CLAIMS)

Soviet Ofticials' Statezents About NOSENKO

The portrait of NOSENKO which exerges from Soviet
efficitals' statements abuut hin since his defection coin-
cides markedly with NOSLNKO'S seti-descripetion. According
to the comments of Soviet officials, principally intelli-
gence officers most likely to be speaking authoritatively,
defector NOSENKO was the son of the deceased sinister, he
served over a decade in the KGB, his personal shortcomings
i were overcome througn the patronage of KG3 General GRIBANOV, i
i and in connection witn vperations against Americans he .

} occupied positions of progressively greater trust and |
}

 

va bnew

  

responsibility, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of the
jargest department in the sey Second (Counterintelligence)
Chief Directorate. According to these sources, his defection
wrought severe damage "for years to come" to tne KGB ;
because of his knowledge of KGB operations against American |
|

   

targets, and his treachery prompted the expulsion and
disgrace of numerous senior KGB personnel, the cecall of
many others from abroad, tne virtual suspension of KGB
operations in the United States, and extraordinary plans to
assassinate him.
