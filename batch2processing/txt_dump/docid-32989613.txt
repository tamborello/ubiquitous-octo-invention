This matter has been coordinated with Jemes EH. Reilly,
Training Division, who had contacted the various division
representatives in an effort to obtain the specific forms
requested by captioned Committee. During the canvass of
division representatives throughout the Bureau, certain
concerns were expressed concerning the furnishing of a few select
forms to the Committee. However, after discussion regarding this
matter, it was concluded that these specific forms would not
endanger any sensitive methods or techniques currently being
utilized by this Bureau. SA Howard W. Dare, Jr. has personally
reviewed each form requested by the Committee and is in
agreement with the above-mentioned conclusion. It should be
noted that the Committee in its request for certain forms listed
FD-185a - Performance Rating Guide for Clerical Personnel.
FD-185a refers to Performance Rating Guide for Investigative
Personnel, FD-185b refers to Performance Rating Guide for
Clerical Personnel. Therefore, both FD-185a and FD-185b are
being made available for the Committee staff, since it is not
clear as to exactly which form the Committee desires, The
following divisional representatives approved making available
for review to the SSC attached respective divisional forms.

 

 

 

 

 

Division 1 - Frank B. Still

Division 2 - No Forms

Division 3 - Fred Woodworth

Division 4 ~- Homer Hauer

Division 5 - woward W. Dare and Robert A, Bermingham
