MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Center for the Study
of Intelligence

 

FROM: John Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: Meeting with JFK Assassination
Records Review Board

This memorandum is for your information.

1, On 18 May 1995, members of the Directorate of
Operations and the Historical Review Group met with the
JFK Assassination Records Review Board to discuss the
declassification of CIA records. The Board had requested
the meeting for purposes of educating its members as to the
categories of information that probably will require
continued protection i.e., by deleting words or inserting
substitute language.

2. The discussion focused on some 30 documents that
describe CIA operations in Mexico City at the time of the
assassination. Among the categories of information
discussed were: locations of stations, surveillance methods,
intelligence liaison relationships, names of agents and
staff officers, and pseudonyms and cryptonyms. In a number
.of instances we suggested alternative ways of describing
sensitive information, which the Board seemed to find a
reasonable approach.

3. No decisions were made by the Board during the three
and half hour meeting, but the session was highly productive
in terms of providing the Board a basis for understanding
material in documents related to sensitive sources and
methods. Board Chairman John Tunheim told me that the Board
found the discussion very helpful. in helping them fulfill
their responsibility for approving or disapproving all
recommendations to withhold information. The Board's’
Executive Director, David Marwell said it was a valuable
meeting, and he complimented the Agency representatives for
being willing to engage in an open-minded discussion that

‘was “not scripted.”
