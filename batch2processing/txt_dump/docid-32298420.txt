DETAILS :
C. ASSOCIATES

On December 6, 1972, PG T-1 advised:

With regard to the story that some guy named ‘
MARIO from East Liberty, Pittsburgh, wanted a guy named ——
SCORATOW "taken care of" and was offering a lot of money,
on December 5, 1972, informant asked KELLY MANNARINO what
his feelings were about the situation. :

MANNARINO said ‘the guy who was supposed to be
the victim i§ SID SCORATOW. He said he considered SID
SCORATOW to be a "creep," and he could not care less what
happened. He said that his brother, MARCO SCORATOW,
was a friend of his, and if the contract had been put out
on MARCO, he would have ordered that somebody take MARIO's
money and then reverse the contract on him. However, he said
under the current situation he did not care which way the
thing was handled, so long as it did not bring any heat on
him or his town, New Kensington, Pa.

On December 10, 1972, PG T-1 advised:

EDDIE KLEIN told him that he knew that the young guy,
TONY MURGIE, had set him up for the recent armed robbery at
KLEIN's residence in Pittsburgh. KLEIN admitted that the
figures concerning the cash and jewelry were inflated, but
claimed he did not give out the figures that high. He says
he is now worried that the Internal Revenue Service. will cause
him trouble. He had no insurance on the stolen property.

: KLEIN said he was worried as he wondered if "the
mob" knew of, and approved, this heist, since the young man,
TONY MURGIE, is a nephew of CHARLIE MURGIE of the Youngstown,
Ohio, area. He pointed out thatnost of the "good stuff"
which had been taken was given to him for disposal by PAUL
HANKISH of Wheeling, W. Va., and he felt HANKISH might be
angered.

HANKISH, when told of the situation, agreed that they’
would have to go through "mob" connections to get the stuff
