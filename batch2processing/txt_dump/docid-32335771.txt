Interview of VAN POLLARD on 11/24/64 reflected that he
lest his left eye in an explosion when about fourteen years old
and therefore was not éligible for service in World War II, It
was noted by interviewing agents that POLLARD's left eye appeared
artificial.

An evaluation of information furnished by POLLARD to date
reflects that information as to the existence and general
backgrounds of people he has alleged are connected with this group
appears accurate. Substantiation of this information has been
conducted in a discreet manner inasmuch as overt background
investigation might at present jeopardize the informant status of
POLLARD, POLLARD appears rational in speech and demeanor
and igs also very consistent in his information. He is never
hesitant in giving this information, his prime purpose and motivation
being that he is more afraid of the government than this group.
He feels that the government is in a better position to protect
him as he feels the group's plot will fail. POLLARD is of the
feeling that he is jeopardizing his life on each contact with the
government agents and wishes these contacts to be held to a very
minimum. He consistently states that he does not know all the
answers but is furnishing all the answers that he mow possesses.
He consistently advises that the group he is attached to is the
"dirty work" group and is the lowest part of this organization.
He feels that in the near future he will be able to extract himself
from this group and believes he may "move up", thus enabling him to be
‘gn a better position for gaining and furnishing the Bureau with
information. POLLARD insists he will not receive payment for this
information, but merely wants protection. He will, however, it
is believed, accept payment for actual expenses. Bearing the
above information in mind, no blamket interviews of individuals
named by POLLARD will be undertken by the Dallas Office at this
time inasmuch aS it is apparent that to do such might well jeopardize
POLLARD’s position as an informant. It is alse believed that
future contacts with POLLARD on a continuing basis will better
allow the Dallas Office to evaluate his information.

It is noted that Kansas City has been able to furnish
no infomation for the purpose of aiding Dallas in the evaluation
and the credibility of POLLARD. .

Enclosed LHW is classified "Confidential" inasmuch as :
information furnished by DL T~2 and DL T-3 could reasonably result ,
in the identification of confidential informants of continuing
value and compromise the future effectiveness thereof. |
