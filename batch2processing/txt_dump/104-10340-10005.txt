Dear Miss Bowen:

1. The Historical Review Group of the Center for the
Study of Intelligence in the.Central Intelligence Agency is
currently reviewing material on the Kennedy Assassination for
release to the National Archives.

2. Attached are six CIA Document Transfer and Cross
Reference sheets from the Lee Harvey Oswald file that contain
information from FBI documents which we propose releasing to
National Archives. We would appreciate the Bureau reviewing
these Cross Reference Sheets to ensure that nothing sensitive
or classified is released. We plan to deny material that is
yellow highlighted.

3. For your information, when Bureau documents come into
the CIA, they are given a DBA number. Unfortunately, these
Cross Reference Sheets do not contain the actual FBI document
number on them. In reviewing these Cross Reference Sheets we
would appreciate a determination from the Bureau on whether it
is necessary for CIA to forward to the Bureau in the future all
Cross Reference Sheets which are based on FBI documents.

4. ‘We appreciate your cooperation.
Sincerely, yours,

Kathleen M. Puchnick

reconsidered for release. This memorandum has attachments

‘MEMORANDUM FOR: Federal Bureau of Investigation

ATTENTION: Ken Neu, Supervisory Special Agent,
Criminal Investigative Division

FROM: Deputy Director for Operations Bg”

SUBJECT: Belarusian S@8's Offer to Review Their File on
Lee Harv Oswald

During meetings with CIA officers on TDY to Minsk, Belarus,
15-18 October 1992, Chairman of the Belarusian KGB (BKGB) General
Eduard Shirkovskiy expanded on his offer to us to review the
BKGB's files on Lee Harvey Oswald, compiled in the early sixties
when Oswald lived in Minsk. Our officers reminded Shirkovskiy
that review of the file falls under FBI jurisdiction and that,
due to political sensitivities in the United States about Oswald,
CIA would prefer not to be directly involved in review of the
file. We would, however, be willing to broker introductions
between the BKGB and the FBI to facilitate review of the file.

Shirkovskiy noted that the BKGB would be willing to give the
FBI copies of relevant portions of the file -~ summaries of
investigation results prepared at the time of Oswald's stay in
Minsk -- but would not share operational information that would
compromise their sources and methods. In addition, the BKGB
would not surrender the original file but would permit an FBI
team to travel to Minsk to inspect the original documents and
verify their authenticity. Sot,
I LF

We are aware that the FBI was preparing to send a letter
through State channels requesting permission to review the file

but, according to previous secure telecon, did not know to whom
in the Belarusian government the letter should be passed. The
message, which will be for the attention of Ambassador David
Swartz, should be addressed to Stanislav Shushkevich, President
and Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, for passage to the Supreme
Soviet, to which the BKGB is directly accountable. General
Shirkovskiy told our officers he would not allow access to the
file without instructions from the Supreme Soviet. We encourage
you to contact us for assistance and.look forward to supporting
your efforts to review the file.
