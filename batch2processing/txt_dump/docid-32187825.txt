On April 20, 1970, check of records of New
Scotland Yard, London, England, reflected that KEITH
HOSKINGS was born October 8, 1928, in St. Kitts; British
West Indies. He arrived in the United Kingdom in 19538
and resides with his mother at 16, Gap Road, Wimbledon,
London. .S.W. 19... In 1960 he was arrested and convicted
for theft and as of April 27, 1970 was about to be ar-
rested again by Metropolitan Police, London, for lar y

_ of money from his employer. tS Ap

 

On April 24, 1970, Detective Sergeant FRED
PARISH, New Scotland Yard, London, interviewed HOSKINGS
at his residence. He described HOSKINGS as a white male
with West Indian accent. He has persisted in saying te
the police that he was not well enough to stand trial
for his present offence of larceny from his employer and
it is believed that the letters he has written to the
F.B.1. at Washington and Dallas, as well.as letters to ' :
American Embassy, London, U.S. Air Force Headquarters,
England, and New Scotland Yard, London, have all been an
attempt on his part to say ‘that he has been cooperating
with New Scotland Yard and the F.B.1., in solving major
erimes, which he hoped would aet in mitigation for,
current offense of larceny from his employer. BF p®

 

When interviewed by Sgt. PARISH, he professed j
intimate knowledge of all the current major crimes in London,
including a kidnaping and murder case and an espionag case
currently being tried. He also claimed to have been mber
of the Mafia sent to England. f

Sergeant PARISH is of the opinion that because of
subject's mental instability he thought he mightsbe immedi-
ately brought. to the U.S. to assist U.S. authorities, ; thus. 7
saving himself from being-.a: and sentenced. in Londs :
