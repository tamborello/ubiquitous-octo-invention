THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT, ON ITS OWN INITIATIVE AND

WITHOUT ANY PROMPTING FROM WASHINGTON, FOUGHT COMMUNIST INSURRECTION
TO A STANDSTILL HERE IN THE EARLY. SIXTIES: THERE WAS NO NEED
OF ANY PAYMENT FROM THE CIA FOR ANYTHING. THE VENEZUELAN GO VERN=-
MENT WAS WHOLEHEARTEDLY IN THIS FIGHT FOR ITS OWN REASONS, TO
PROTECT ITS OWN INTERESTS, USING ITS OWN RESOURCES."

@, NOTE IN THE ABOVE THAT THE JOURNAL HAS MADE THE
SAME ERROR AS THE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA IN ATTRIBUTING INFO
FROM "INTELLIGENCE SOURCES" AND "AN OLD OFFICIAL OF THE CIA" AS
COMING FROM DAVID PHILLIPS. SINCE ONE OF THE FAVORITE STUNTS IN
THIS COUNTRY IS TO QUOTE STATEMENTS oUT OF CONTEXT AND/OR MISQUOTE
ACCIDENTALLY OR ON PURPOSE. SUCH STATEMENTS RARELY CLARIFY ANYTHING;
THEY ONLY COMPLICATE» ALMOST ALWAYS TO OUR DISADVANTAGE
