a fair inference that there would have been no reason
to maintain it [the contact/ unless there was some
possibility of reactivating that operation."' (19).

TAB W (pp. 42-53 -- 6/11/75)

Bissell testified: "There is little doubt in my mind
that Project RIFLE was discussed with ROSTOW and
possibly BUNDY." (46).. Bissell said he discussed
"all aspects of the creation of the capability." (50).
Bissell said it was "quite possible" that he discussed
CASTRO, TRUJILLO, and LUMUMBA with ROSTOW as examples
of assassination targets. (50).

‘When asked a final time, by Senator Baker, whether he
recalled discussing the assassination capability with
ROSTOW and BUNDY, Bissell replied: "I am not sure
about BUNDY, but I think ROSTOW, yes, sir.'' (52)

 

 

 

 
 

- Did the CIA send a cable to the Dominican
station on May 29,-1961 as an authentic state- D
ment of a policy to dissociate from political ; —
assassination? Or, was this an attempt to
create a written record favorable to the U.S.
which was contrary to previous policy?

BUNDY's testimony in relation to the TRUJILLO assassina-
tion should involve the following questions (see the
Tabs indicated, which are contained in the binder of
TRUJILLO materials):

 

1. SPECIAL GROUP MINUTES - 12 January 1961 (Tab J)

. Special Group approved the supply of a limited number
of small arms and other material to dissidents in the
Dominican Republic.

2. SPECIAL GROUP MINUTES - 14 February 1961 (Tab A

BUNDY binder )

"Mr. Bundy asked that a memorandum be prepared for
higher authority on the subject of what plans can
be made for a successor government to Trujillo." -
What precipitated this request?

McGEORGE BUNDY

Testimony of Richard Bissell on EXECUTIVE ACTION

1. TABS « 48-54 -- 6/9/75)

Bissell testified that when he asked HARVEY to
create the EXECUTIVE ACTION CAPABILITY it ‘could
have been BUNDY" (49) or ROSTOW (51). who asked him
to do this. Bissell does not recall any specific
conversation (51). Bissell and Rostow are "the
names of the two people from whom it /the request
for such a capability/ is most likely to come from."
(53).

2. TAB T (pp. 58-59 -- 6/9/75)

Bissell said he assumes that BUNDY and ROSTOW. would
have been the bureaucratic channel for such a request
(58).

3. TAB U (pp. 80-83 -- 6/9/75)

Bissell testified that the "“urgings’for an EXECUTIVE
ACTION CAPABILITY could have come at the weekly
luncheon meetings with BUNDY, ROSTOW, and. represen-
tatives from STATE, CIA, and DEFENSE (81-82).

Bissell testified that as he normally operated, he
would have replied to ROSTOW in such cases (82).
"When I reported to him /ROSTOW7 it would have gone
to BUNDY as well." (82)7

4. TAB V (pp. 16-19 -- 6/11/75)

IG REPORT, 1967: "On November 15, 1961, HARVEY has
a note that on that date he discussed with Bissell
the application of these ZR/RIFLE programs to Cuba.
HARVEY says that Bissell instructed him to take over
EDWARDS' contact with the criminal syndicate, and
thereafter to run the operation against CASTRO."

Bissell testified that he did not recall directing

the reactivation of the project but, he said, "I

think I did, as part of Mr. HARVEY's responsibility

for Project RIFLE, instruct him to take over the contact."
(19). Bissell agreed that the purpose of the contact

MEMORANDUM

TO: Frederick A. 0. Schwarz, Jr.
FROM: Frederick Baron ,
DATE: July 10, 1975

McGEORGE BUNDY: TRUJILLO SUMMARY

McGeorge Bundy was Special Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs from January 20, 1961 until
1966. TRUJILLO was assassinated on May 30, 1961. During
1961 in the Kennedy Administration much of the primary
responsibility for following Dominican Republic affairs
was delegated by BUNDY to RICHARD GOODWIN.

The following broad issues should be raised in the ques-
tioning of Mr. BUNDY in relation to the TRUJILLO assassi-

Nation:

- What construction was given by the CIA, State
Department, and Special Group during the Kennedy
Administration to the January 12, 1961 decision
by the Special Group in the waning days of the
Eisenhower Administration to approve "limited
supplies of small arms and other material" to
Dominican dissidents. Did this authorization
carry over? Was it stretched to cover supplies
of potential assassination weapons?

- Did the reporting to the President and the NSC
staff from State and CIA provide adequate notice
of the prepensities for assassination on the part
of Dominican dissident groups with whom the CIA
was in contact? (See Rusk memo of 2/15/61, Bissell
memo of 2/17/61, and CIA memo of 5/13/61).
Specifically, did Bissell's memo of February 17,
1961 adequately respond to your request for infor-
mation for "higher authority’?
