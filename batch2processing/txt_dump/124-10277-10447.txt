Th grenfou investigation has reflected that Dr. .
Orlando /Bos vila, head of the MIRR, an anti-Castro organ-
ization at Miami, was compelled to abandon plans for an
attack upon the "Las Villas", a Cuban freighter, -when this
_vessel recently avoided the east coast of South Florida on a
voyage from Marseilles, France, to Havana; Cuba. This ship.
departed Marseilles on May 4, 1964, and was scheduled to dock
'.in Havana on May 25, 1964.

On May 26, 1964, MM T-1, a Cuban exile who is
friendly with some of Bosch's close associates, advised that
Bosch has begun to lay new plans for another attack against
Cuba.

Current Investigation

May 285.1964» MM T-1 reported that on May 27,
1964, Jesus)Manche tinez, who is also known_as imi",
and Evelioy izaryy rez, associates of Bosch, we went to
Orlando, - ‘lorida , ‘upon instructions of Bosch, to examine two
airplanes with the view of renting one or both for the next
-MIRR operation. MM T-1 said that Sanchez and Alpizar were
transported from Miami to Orlando, and return, by an American,
age about 47, 5'8" tall, weighing 180 pounds, black badcgray:
hair, known only as "otis", and a friend of Bosch. -"“Otis"
was accompanied by his wife or girl friend, named "Carole".
MM T-1 said Bosch decided against renting either of these
planes at Orlando, both of which were owned by a medical
docter, because of exorbitant rental fees demanded.
