1, Mr. Heinonen called to advise that Mr. CT would
be available for a meeting on 11 April and asked if I would come
to the (LBGLOBE downtown office to attend. In preparation for
the méeting I contacted Mr. Rocca to determine what recent
developments had taken place in New York with regard to Herbert
Itkin's accepting the compromise solution reached between Messrs.
Hogan and Morgenthau,

2. Mr. Rocca advised that the State of New York had with-
drawn from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York its motion to remand Herbert Itkin to the State of New
York for trial. Secondly, Mr. Rocca stated that the Family Court
of Westchester County had denied Herbert Itkin's request for
rehearing the custody award of Mrs. Itkin's two sons. Thirdly,
Herbert Itkin had prepared a draft letter to George Washington
University, School of Diplomacy (sic), in which Itkin purported
to offer a manuscript describing his work with the CIA for
publication by the University. Itkin did stipulate that the University
would have to obtain the approval of the DCI before publication of
the book. It is puzzling to fathom Itkints real motivation in
making this offer,

3, I met with Mr, (5 on 11 April at the LBGLOBE
office in Washington and explained to him the developments which
had taken place with regard to Herbert itkin's legal entanglements
in New York City. I pointed out to MZ that we assessed
his risk of exposure based upon three possibilities: (a) the
unpublished feature article prepared by of the
