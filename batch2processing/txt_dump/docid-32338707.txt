inte action along the desired lines. It will be noted further that the
basic plan for his activities 4s in line with the plan of his prior visit, |
namely a luncheon sponsored by ‘outstanding persons is to bé given, at

which CARTER will have an opportunity to make an address, as he did when
previously in Los Angeles. Arrangements are proceeding in the Los Angeles
Division to insure eppropriate coverage of CARTER'S arrival and events :
transpiring while he is here. The Now York Field Division has been ree
guested by teletype to place CARTER: under such appropriate close surveil-

‘lance as will disclose his activities, connections, and time of depare

ture from New York as anticipated We

with reference to he individuals nontionad in the telee.
gram from CARTER above cited, it is interesting to note that immediately
following his conference with MEADE, subject endeavored.to get in touch
with Senator ROBERT W. KENNY, but on inquiry learned that Senator ‘KENNY .

“would be out of town for several weeks. It 1s noted that Senator KENNY

is a prominent political personage, being a State Senator of California —
and frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for the governorship of
the states, It was from the office of senator KENNY, via MAURICE COHEN, ~
as noted in the writer's report dated September 20, 1941, ‘that BIBERMAN
obtained a dial list of. possible sponsors for the Russian Relief Pro-

ject. \z] AN ;

Tt will be recalled that reference report cites a suggestion
by BIBERMAN that JANE MEADE was the daughter of a Commander in the United
States Navy, which fact he considered important background for the use of
MEADE in the office of Russian War Relief. Collateral inquiries concerning
JANE MEADE have disclosed that she resides at 11168 Moorpark St., North
Hollywood, Calif., telephone Stmset 23003.. This telephone is listed to
KURT NEUMANN, with whom MEADE has been in contact, as noted in reference
report, under such circumstances as to warrant the statement that M@ADE'S
true name is Mrs. KURT NEUMANN. } However, it is noted that a 1940 Chevrolet
Coupe, California license 7598-467 has been frequently observed in the
vicinity of BIBERMAN'S home,.and this.car is registered to JANE LAWSON MEADE '
of 1154 North Formosa Street, Hollywood. @ car also was observed parked \
in the driveway of DIMITRI TIOMKIN'S home lon the occasion’ of a luncheon :
meeting which is known to have been attended by JANE MEADE (NEUMAIN) , as (
recorded in the writer's report in this case dated sept. 20. This woman
