1, Based on our discussion with Judy Miller, my ‘understanding was that
Mr. Blakey's most recent request. for- data from NSA involved a review of
post-assassination[[ product on a world-wide basis to determine
if reports relevant to the assassination exist. Though Ms. Miller did s
not specify a.time period, a three month period subsequent to the event
would involve - as an example - six to nine thousand reports and would
require 120 to 150 hours of analyst time just to conduct a’manual search
of the microfilm files where these records reside.

-2. I subsequently spoke with Mr. Reger Denk, DIA, who had actually
participated in the briefing of Mr. Blakey, using our SECRET-level’ statement
as a basis. Mr. Denk advises that DIA has destroyed all its files which
might relate to the assassination and that, therefore, he had had nothing
to offer Blakey except the NSA-prepared sanitized statement. Mr. Denk also
provided a different, much more ambitious new requirement from Blakey than
that reported by Judy Miller.

3. According to Denk, what Blakey really. wants from NSA is for us to
conduct a thorough review of all Cuban communications during the six year
period from January 1959. to December 1964, in order to see "what the Cubans
were talking about/thinking about" of possible relevance to the assassina-
tion - a real. fishing expedition in my view. Blakey is also reported to
desire a "characterization of the traffic" - and not the traffic itself.

4. This latest version of Blakey's interests, which has probably
been stated to us fairly accurately by Denk, represents a very significant
work load indeed. Based'on some very educated estimates made by the
people in T12 who maintain the historical microfilm’ files, :there were
approximately 200,000 Cuban reports or translations issued’ during the six
year period of interest, and roughly 2,000 man-hours of effort would be
required to search these records for items of interest.

5. As we have discussed previously, I believe that NSA - in a number
of separate, thorough analytic efforts - has performed’reasonable and
detailed reviews of all available signals intelligence. None of these
reviews has resulted in’the derivation of any data of direct significance
to the assassination. A summary of these separate.NSA efforts is attached.
