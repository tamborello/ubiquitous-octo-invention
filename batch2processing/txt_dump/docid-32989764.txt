RE: HOUSE*SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

; Dr. King was shot to death by an assassin's bullet
while standing on a balcony of a motel in Memphis, Tennessee,
on 4/4/68. The U. S. Department of Justice requested the
FBI to conduct an immediate Civil Rights investigation into
this assassination which was confirmed in writing by a letter
from Stephen J. Pollak, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights
Division, to the Director of the FBI, which requested a full
investigation into a possible violation of Title 18, U. Ss.
Code, Section 241, (possible conspiracy to violate the Civil
Rights of Dr. King, namely, the right to travel interstate.)

; The FBI conducted an extensive, exhaustive investigation
into this assassination and James Earl Ray was identified as the
assassin. Our investigative results were furnished to the

Civil Rights Division, U. S. Department of Justice, and based

upon the authority of the Department, certain pertinent investigative
results were furnished to the appropriate local authorities in

the State of Tennessee. On 3/10/69, in state court, Memphis,
fennessee, Ray entered a plea of guilty to charges of the

murder of King and received a 99-year sentence. Ray is. presently

in local confinement.

By letter dated 12/4/75, the Attorney General of the
United States advised that on 11/24/75, he directed Assistant
Attorneys General J. Stanley Pottinger and Richard L. Thornburg)
to review the files relating to Martin Luther King at once in
the light of recent testimony, and make a recommendation as to
whether the assassination case should be reopened. The
Department had complete access to the Civil Rights assassination
investigative file during its review.

On 4/29/76, the Attorney General of the United States
issued the following news release:

"T have directed the Office of Professional Responsibility,
headed by Michael Shaheen, to complete a review of all records
in the Department of Justice concerning the Reverend Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. The Civil Rights Division, under the
personal direction of Assistant Attorney General J. Stanley
Pottinger, completed on April 9 a five-month preliminary review

Memorandum to. Mr. Gallagher
RE: HOUSECSELECT COMMITTEE ON. ASSASSINATIONS

of files at FBI headquarters. As, a result of this
preliminary review, the Civil Rights Division has
recommended that the review be carried forward to completion
with an additional examination of records at FBI :
headquarters and field offices. It is believed that more
than 200,000 documents may be involved.

On the basis of this preliminary review, Assistant
Attorney General Pottinger stated that his tentative
conclusions were (1) there was no basis to believe that
the FBI in any way caused the death of Dr. King, (2) no
evidence was discovered that the FBI investigation of
the assassination of Dr. King was not thorough and honest,
and (3) instances were found indicating that the FBI under-
took a systematic program of harassment of Dr. King in
order to discredit him and harm both him and the movement
he led.

In ordering on April 26 the complete review by
Mx. Shaheen, I directed that the investigation be completed
forthwith and that answers to four specific questions be
furnished to me and FBI Director Clarance M. Kelley on the
basis of the review of all documents:

-- Whether the FBI investigation of Dr. King's
assassination was thorough and honest;

-- Whether there is any evidence that the FBI was
involved in the assassination of Dr. King;

-- Whether, in light -of the first two matters, there
is any new evidence-which has come to the attention of the
Department concerning the aSsassination of Dr. King;

-- Whether the nature of the relationship betwéen the
Bureau and Dr. King calls for criminal prosecutions, disciplinary
proceedings, or other appropriate action.

Mr. Pottinger pointed out that the Civil Rights
Division has been continuously investigating allegations
concerning the assassination of Dr. King as these- “allegations
come to the attention of the, Department." -
 

 

 

 

Memorandum to Mr. Gallagher .
RE: HOUSE-SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

(1) What authority the Committee has to request access;

(2) What effect access would have on the local prosecution

oppose disclosing identity of informants or persons who
furnished information on a confidential basis and (5) What
action it intends to take to obtain third-agency clearance
