Debbie,

This is in reference to our telephone conversation of Wednesday, May 21st. Per Ms.
Graham, FOI/PA Officer, nothing in this record appears to have originated with the United States
Marshals Service. It does look like it originated with U.S Probation office or Parole Commission.

We are therefore returning it to you. Thank you.
