The New York Office was furnished a written report made
available by BU 82-C* covering this meeting by airtel dated
December 6, 1962. Because a great portion of the information
furnished by LU 82-C* is in the Sicilian dialect, the assistance
of the Bureau and the New York Office was requested to translate
and report upon the significance of the meeting at Buffalo,

New York, on September 24, 1962.
