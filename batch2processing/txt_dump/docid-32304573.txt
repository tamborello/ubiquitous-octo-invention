A. :
Co By letter dated 6/22/64 classified Secret, MI-5
advised as follows:(S )

MI-5 had the registers of the Victoria and Mayfair
Hotels checked back to the beginning of June 1963 but as suspected
no trace of BOCK or DEEGAN having stayed there was discovered,
No record of any official of Chinese Peoples Republic (CPR) was
discovered as having stayed at either hotel during the period in
question. MI-5 points out it is very unusual for visiting Chinese
officialsto be booked into a hotel as they are normally accommo-
dated at one of the Chinese Diplomatic Mission (CDM) premises,
MI-5 is confident that any exception to this rule during the
pertinent period or at any other time would have come to its
attention, TANG MING CHAO did not visit the UK until later in
the year, that is, from 9/30 to 10/26/63 during which period he
was accommodated at the CDM main building.(g) a S:

   

E MI-5 speculates that if the names BOCK and

a a DEEGAN are bogus, as they apparently are, it wonders whether the
a references to the two hotels are not equally fictitious, MI-5

S would be interested in ascertaining if the two envelopes involved °*
S in this matter bear the hotels name in print or any other in- —

ba signia that might indicate a clear connection with the Mayfair

Z fa and Victoria Hotels, Accordingsto MI-5 printed stationery is

a 4 readily available in the public rooms of the Mayfair but in the

fa ie Victopaa" Hotel there is a guest house with no public rooms where
st it igftva viable to guests and is used only by the management GS)

JTM:rn : ‘

MI-5 has inquired into the possibility of the Chinese having
acquired samples of the hotel's printed stationery direct from

the printers as.a result of which this has been ruled out.

MI-5 states if the envelopes concerned can be specifically
attributed to the two hotels it will consider examining its
records for information pertaining to contacts of the Chinese

who have in the past stayed in either of them, This, MI-5

points out, is quite a formidable task, MI-5 states over the
years the Mayfair Hotel has been used by contacts of the

Chinese but not as far as it can determine, the Victoria Hote1.C$)

MI-5 states it was interested in the possible
technique used and it might be of some significance that "
according to a delicate and reliable MI-5 source, since July.
1963, fictitious, very English sounding names, that is JOHN
SMITH, FRANK BAKER, CHARLES FINCH, JOHN CARTWRIGHT, etc. have
been used by the New China News Agency, London and one of its
overseas contacts in circumstayces which suggest that their
use was calculated to mislead

The Bureau is requested to furnish information
concerning the envelopes as desired by MI-5 in a form

suitable for dissemination to.it.(§)
