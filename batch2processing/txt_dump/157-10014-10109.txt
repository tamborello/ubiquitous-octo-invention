HARVEY writes a memorandum to DDP HELMS saying

that he advised Lansdale's aide FRANK HAND to

excise the words "including liquidation of leaders".
from the LANSDALE memo because of "the inadmissibility
and stupidity of putting this type of comment in
writing in such a document", Harvey also tells Helms
that he has “careful notes" on MC NAMARA'S discussion
of assassination at the Special Group meeting of
August 10. .

Pills still in place; HARVEY learns that VARONA is
ready to send another team to Cuba. (51)

CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS

HARVEY and ROSELLI agree in Los Angeles to call off
the operation, although not to break precipitously
with VARONA. (52)

‘HARVEY and ROSELLI have last dinner in Washington

and are observed by SAM PAPICH of the FBI, who has
ROSELLI under intensive surveillance. Harvey asks
Papich to let him know if HOOVER is going to call
MC CONE. (53-4) Harvey briefs Helms and Helms

agrees not_to brief McCone unless it appears that
McCone will receive a call from Hoover. (54)-

Spurred by a Chicago newspaper story of the same
day, HELMS sends MC CONE the Edwards memo of 5/14/62
of the RFK briefing. (69)

HARVEY passes the pills. to ROSELLI in Florida. (47)
Roselli was to give the pills to Varona, who had an
asset in Cuba with access to Castro's restaurant.

"MACEO" as contacts with Cuba rather than Trafficante.

©. (47-8)

HARVEY, with help of Ted SHACKLEY (Chief of JMWAVE
station in Miami), loaded arms and equipment in a
U-Haul truck which was left in a parking lot for
Roselli, who delivered it to a Cuban contact. (49- 50)

Intense contact between HARVEY and ROSELLI. Roselli

KENNEDY on PHASE I of the assassination operation. (62a)*

Edwards tells HARVEY of. the briefing of RFK. (65)
Harvey says that he briefed HELMS about this and
advised against briefing McCone (DCI) or Carter
(DDCI); Helms agreed. (65

HARVEY is told by EDWARDS that the "tacit approval"
of the DCI should be obtained if Roselli was to be
used any further. (65) Harvey told Edwards that
Roselli would not be used any more. (According to
Edwards' memorandum of 5/14/62.) (42)

ROSELLI tells HARVEY that VARONA has sent three men

to Cuba to recruit others for the pill plot. (51)

tion of leaders".
