ADMINISTRATIVE:

MARCELLO has been the subject of extensive news
media reporting in the past three months under his alleged
association with AUBREY YOUNG and other political figures
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. None of this information from
the news media being incorporated in this report. This
matter has resolved itself intoapolitical fight in Louisiana
as to who is and who is not controled by MARCELLO.

 

On January 25, 1968, NO 1232-C-TE provided
information relative to the fact that CARLOS MARCELLO was
attempting to bribe EDWARD GRADY PARTIN in the amount of
$50,000 to change testimony he had previously given in a
U. S. District Court resulting in the confinement of JAMES
HOFFA, teamster unit official. Informant advised that he
had recently talked to CYRIL PORETTO who told him that
JOSEPH PORETTO, close associate of MARCELLO, advised him
that he had observed the $50,000 in an attache case he
was carrying. MARCELLO told JOSEPH PORETTO that this
$50,000 was for PARTIN. JOSEPH PORETTO claims that he.
strongiy recommended that MARCELLO not involve himself
in the HOFFA matter.
