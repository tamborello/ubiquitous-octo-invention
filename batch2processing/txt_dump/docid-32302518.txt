ADMINISTRATIVE

On April 5, “1961, SA HAROLD L, WILLIAMS, Pittsburgh Sourld-Trained
Agent, and SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III surveilled the cottage of
GABRIEL MANNARINO located on Old Leechburg Road, R. D. No. 3;
Leechburg, Pa., with a view toward ascertaining the feasibility
of a technical installation. All construction appeared to be
complete and nobody was observed in the neighborhood. Because of
the rural location, terrain, limited service facilities and
proximity ‘of neighbors friendly toward MANNARINO, it was apparent
that such an installation would have numerous technical, mechanical
and security problems and would be very difficult. Special Agents
handling these matters will continue to be alert for possibilities
for technical coverage for this and other logical locations.

on March 14, 1961, was conducted hy SA C, GRAHAM HURST,
