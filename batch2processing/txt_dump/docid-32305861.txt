On 3/15/68 the issue of "Life" magazine published the third article
concerning "The Mob" with emphasis placed on the activities of
JOSEPH CERRITO and members of his LCN family, as well as naming
JAMES JOSEPH LANZA, boss of the San Francisco LCN family.

tact with JOHN ARDIZZONE, of the law firm of Saleiccia and Ardizzone,
on the afternoon of 6/5/68, at which time ARDIZZONE. advised that in
the civil action involving JOSEPH CERRITO and "Life" magazine, at-
torneys for "Life" have subpoenaed numerous individuals throughout
the nation for the purpose of taking depositions.
