_

By letter dated 5/14/75, with attached s appen ides§
the SSC requested certain information and documents from gL

the FBI.

Appendix C, Item number 10, requested all memoranda
and other materials relating to the elimination of the Liaison
Section of the FBI in 1970 and its reestablishment in late
1972.

Among the enclosures to our letter to the Attorney
General (AG), dated 6/13/75, being proposed for forwarding
to the Committee is HE. S. Miller memorandum to Mr. Felt,
7/14/72. On page 2 there is information that “our close 4

association with the Chief Postal Inspector and his top Rae PF
officials has resulted in that agency providing support in ‘a
some of our most delicate intelligence operations looking A}
to the identification of illegal hostile intelligence é

activities in this country." This could possibly be construed

: to include opening of mail. It is to be noted that opening

| of mail by FBI is the subject of a separate SSC request and

; future correspondence with the SSC, through the AG, will
address itself to this subject. Former Chief Postal Inspector
Henry B. Montague, with whom we have had extensive dealings

in the past, is scheduled to appear before the full SSC on
6/12/75 and it is expected that he will be questioned about

possible FBI participation in mail openings. ,

Re: UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEES
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

SSC has requested committee staff access to all indices and
control files pertaining to all programs operated by the
Intelligence Division from 1960 to present and it is expected
that HILEV will: be included in the response to this request.

(1) The DAG has asked me to request that the Bureau make
a file check to determine what, if any, documents may be found
in FBI files relating to a request made by Mr. Doar in August
1964 for information and Bureau-action regarding members of the
subject delegation. It is our understanding that Mr. Doar
requested certain information from the FBI regarding this delé~
gation in mid-August 1964; and that some information was delivered
to the DOJ (either to Mr. Doar or then DAG Katzenbach) shortly
thereafter, in the latter part of August 1964.

(2) It is possible that Mr. Doar may be asked about these
matters in connection with the Senate Select Committee inquiry
(reference Appendix D, Item 7, 5/14/75 SSC request). The DAG
has also asked that, after such documentation as may be developed
under (1) above has been located, the Bureau furnish to him its
view as to the access/delivery to Mr. Doar of such documentation
for the purpose of refreshing his recollection.

(3) An expeditious response to this request will be

NOTE: According to referenced communication, Mr. Doar requested
to review a communication he caused to be sent while in the Department
asking for information concerning the Mississippi Freedom Democratic
Party Delegation. The Deputy Attorney General had asked that the
documentation concerning the request and our response be located and
furnished to him. The Department also asked our views as to whether
he should be given access to or delivered the documents for the purpose

ss Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, to Nr. John Mintz, Legal

B
: sf Regarding your request contained in referenced communication
; s for the Bureau to locate and furnish certain documents, it is my under-

E standing that you are in possession of the documents requested.

& In response to your request that we ‘urnish our observations
: A concerning the making of the documents available to former Assistant
Attorney General John Doar, may I suggest that this raises an issue
which has been discussed in the past by the Bureau and the Department
-and other Governmest agencies. This issue to my knowledge has not
been resolved. That issue is whether a former employee should be
allowed access to documents in the Government's possession to refresh
his recollection for possible testimony before the Senate Select Committee.
Rt is this Eureau's position that such documents should not be made
available for the aforementioned purpose, and in those instances where
a former employee cannot respoad accurately to the question of the Senate
Select Committee or any other Congressional investigative body, the
Committee or Congressional body can be referred to the appropriate
bureau or agency which will, if appropriate, furnish the necessary
! _Lpformation. lam sure you will understand our concern in this regard
_ Aas, Dir, — ofar as setting a precedent which might serve for future requests of
Dep, AD Inv. nature.

Begin Statement (CONFIDENTIAL) :

With the exception of a weekly publication by the
CIA on international terrorism, requested by the Cabinet
Committee on January 1, 1973, the intelligence functions
of the Cabinet Committee and its Working Group are handled
through established interagency channels. The agencies
most active in generation and coordination of terrorism
information for the Working Group-are the CIA, the FBI,
NSA, DOD, the Secret Service, the Department of Treasury ‘
and the State Department.

These Working Group agencies set their own priorities
"and parameters concerning intelligence on terrorism mat-
ters. From time to time the CIA requests comments from
the Working Group on its weekly terrorism reports.

The organization of the Cabinet Committee is de-
lineated in the President's memorandum of September 25,
1972. The Working Group is composed of senior repre- .
sentatives of the ten agencies on the Cabinet Committee
and representatives of the following agencies: Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, Energy Research and
Development Administration, Federal Protective Service,
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration, Metropolitan Police Department,
National Security Agency, Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Office of Management and Budget, and the United States
Information Agency. These additional agencies were in-
vited to participate in the Working Group by the Special
Assistant to the Secretary and Coordinator for Combatting ©
Terrorism (S/CCT), in his capacity as Chairman of the
Working Group.

Under the Working Group there is one formal sub-
group, the Behavioral Science Resource Group (BSRG),
which is composed of behavioral science experts from
the State Department, the CIA, the FBI and USIA. The
State Department member chairs BSRG. The Resource Group
