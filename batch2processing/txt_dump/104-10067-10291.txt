1. REF A CABLE ANSWERS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS OF PRIMARY
CONCERN. TO THIS STATION, GUT AT SAME TIME, IT CONFIRMS THE WORST
FEARS EXPRESSED IN REF 6 CONCERNING REVELATIONS ABOUT OPERATIONS
AGAINST THE SOVIET TARGET IN MEXICO CITY,

2.° IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE, THE NBC PROGRAM CANNOT HELP BUT
BE DAMAGING TO U,S. SECURITY INTERESTS AND THIS AGENCY IN THE
FOLLOWING MANWERs :

A, REVELATION OF SOURCES, THE STATEMENT BY BACH IN
REF C THAT HE "HAD NOT IDENTIFIED ANY SOURCES BY NAME OR DES=
CRIPTION THROUGHOUT THE TAPING..." IS REFUTED BY THE STATEMENT.
THAT A SOVIET WAS RECRUITED BY FORMER COS (ROGER T, KINGMAN)
DURING HIS TOUR, APART FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CIRCUM@
STANCES UNDER WRICH THE RECRUITMENT WAS MADE, THE SIMPLE STATE@
MENT THAT A SOVIET OFFICIAL WAS RECRUITED IS SUFFICIENT TO
SET OFF A FULL SCALE INVESTIGATION BY THE KGB INTO EVERY
SOVIET OFFICIAL wHO SERVED IN MEXICO CITY DURING THAT TIME
FRAME, THE SOVIETS HAVE THE RESOURCES AND DETERMINATION TO
EVENTUALLY IGENTIFY THE SPY,

Bo FUTURE RECRUITMENTS, HOw WILL IT BE POSSIBLE FOR
THIS AGENCY TO KECRUIT SOVIETS, OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER, IF
THE AGENCY CANNOY OFFER GUARANTEES THAT THE IDENTITY OF SOURCES
sILL NOT BE ExPaoseD BY SOME EMPLOYEE, REGARDLESS OF MOTIVATION?
WHILE THIS PROGSAM KILL HAVE IMMEDIATE IMPACT IN MEXICO CITY,
LA Pad, AND MGWTEVIDEO, THE FALLOUT AFFECTING FUTURE RECRUITMENTS:
