MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 15 June 1978

SUBJECT: Actions Taken by NSA to Locate Information Related
to the Assassination of President Kennedy

A. Over the past fourteen and one-half years, NSA has
performed a number of separate in-depth reviews of materials in
its files in an attempt to isolate data that might be relevant
to the assassination of President Kennedy. Nothing of significance
has been determined as a result of those reviews.

1. November-December 1963 - Immediately after the
assassination, NSAinitiated a large-scale manual and machine
review of available SIGINT, including all U.S./Cuba traffic (NSA
intercepted messages at an average of 1,000 per day at that time).
A computer search was initiated using Oswald's name as the minimum
for research criteria. Additionally, all traffic between Cuba/New
Orleans and Cuba/Dallas was manually reviewed (an analyst involved
recalled that 25 to 50 analysts reviewed the traffic manually,
along with traffic from Cuba and some Soviet traffic). Sometime
during the search, items from the Oswald address book provided by
the FBI were added to the search criteria.

2. 1964'- Warren Commission - The Commission, in the
person of Allan Dulles, asked NSA to review the exhibits for any
secret writings or-.codes which might have been contained in the
documents. It also appears that NSA searched’ records for information
on the basis of other Warren Commission requests made informally
by Allen Dulles.

3. November 1975 - Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC):

In response to an SSC request on the Assassination,
NSA reviewed its Soviet and Cuban files, including Cuban military.
The search was also for material involving Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby
or Earl Ruby (a Harvest run was made). [___ltrastic was also
reviewed, looking for information concerning Swald"s-visit to

Mexico. (5)(g)(2)(D)

 

4. June 1976 - Pursuant to FOIA requests asking for
material relating to Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination
