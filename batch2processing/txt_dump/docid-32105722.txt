Kissinger: We can take sections from your [State of the World] speech
and expand it. The people last night think within a year there will be
an enormous backlash, This Congress is really McGovern's, because
of Watergate. Osborne thought your speech was great and the pardon
was one of the most courageous things you have done, The press is
out of touch with the country.

President; The local press. Not out in the country.

Kissinger: The press is out of touch. Now that the Israelis have taken
us on this year -- this year rather than next -- we maybe have the
opportunity... We maybe should go for all the marbles.

President: Any reaction from Greece and Turkey to my speech?

Kissinger: The Turks are delighted. The Greeks are too, but they
wanted the money under the table.

President: We haven't heard anything from Brezhnev.
Kissinger: Hamilton said he would introduce something.

Itold Javits if he is a Jewish spokesman he had to talk to me as
an American and what is in it for the United States,

Israel has done something again I would like to protest about.
‘I told Allon about your talk with Schmidt, to show them the concern
about Portugal. Now it is in the Israeli papers. Itdld Allon about
them going to the Germans to contact the Europeans. They [the
Israelis] in doing it this way make it look as if they are going behind
our backs.

Egypt is afraid of an attack. I think we should tell them if it
happens we will formally dissociate.

President: Should we tell the Israelis that?
Kissinger: When Allon is here,
Three out of five speeches now on foreign policy would be good.

Rallying the people should be the theme. We should stress the last
part of the speech, but not avoid Vietnam either,

President: Is the Vice President going to go?

Kissinger: He doesn't want to. Ge, %
