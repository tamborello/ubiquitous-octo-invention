d, The files of CIA employees and former employees will be
suggested for deletion from the case. Such documents would not be
released under the FOIA in any case.

e, OGC will attempt to have deleted from the case all
records pertaining to U.S. persons. The argument here is that the
Agency is responsible only for collecting information abroad and
also that any information on U.S. persons would be searchable by the

FBI.

4. We have been asked to provide OGC for the meeting on 4
August some estimate of the time required to process this material,
For this purpose we were asked to assume that all documents in this
case would be processed. We explained that the only case that
nearly approaches the sequestered documents is the MIA case. We are
now collecting the information on the MIA case to provide some
estimate of time. The MIA case has taken us thus far about five
years and we expect to take one more year to complete it.

5, We have suggested to OGC that in the context of their
discussion of this case at Justice, they take some of the following

points into consideration:
a. Although a large number of documents are involved in

the sequestered material, no new information regarding the Kennedy

assassination can be expected,
b. The tax payer should not be required to spend an

inordinate amount of additional money on this project in light of
the cost of past investigations into the Assassination by Congress

and other investigating committees.
c. To the best of our knowledge, only one person has

-requested this material; it hardly can be regarded of overwhelming

interest to the public.
d. Therefore, we should not waive fees for duplicating

costs, and explore ways of charging for converting the film into
hard paper copies.

6. We have requested OGC to provide us with a memorandum
advising us that the sequestered material can be opened and

processed.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Emilio Jaksetic
Office of General Counsel

FROM: Gerald L. Liebenau
: C/DO/ IMS/FPLG

SUBJECT: - ; Estimate for Processing Sequestered
: Kennedy Documents

1. At our meeting on 1 August, you requested an estimate for
processing approximately 200,000 pages of documents sequestered by
the House Assassination Committee at the conclusion of its :
investigation of the Kennedy assassination. At this point, with no
certain knowledge of the nature of the documents, our best estimate
is five years.

2. We have arrived at that estimate by making a rough
comparison with the Missing in Action (MIA) case, which contained
66,382 documents. That case required approximately two years for
pre-processing, i.e. to index all documents, remove duplicates,
refer non-Agency documents, remove classified marginal information
and attach addoc sheets to each document. That procedure required
approximately 17 part-time clerks and analysts. It is expected that

‘ the MIA case will require an excess of three years for the
completion of the substantive review. This will bring the total
processing time of the MIA case to five years. The substantive
review requires a team of three part-time analysts assisted by
several clerical processors.

3. Upon receipt of your memorandum authorizing the processing
of the sequestered documents, lan to take the following action:
a. Conduct a surveyL of the sequestered
documents in order to determine how thé material was stored and in
what order processing can take place.
b. Convert the 75 rolls of film into paper copy. ~
., (Note: We have been given an estimate that this process
would require about 80 man-hours at a total cost of $6,800).
c. Index all documents by document number, date, and title.
dad. Organize the case according to the agreement reached by

’ your office with the requester.
-e, Begin the substantive processing.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Sequestered Kennedy Assassination Records

1. On 1 August; OGC requested a meeting to discuss with us the
processing of approximately 200,000 pages of documents which had
been sequestered by the House Assassination Committee in its”
investigation of the Kennedy assassination. The meeting was
attended for OGC by Launie Ziebel and Emilio Jaksetic., Russ Holmes,
Lou Dube and I represented the DO. CIA's efforts to have those
documents declared Congressional records, and therefore outside the
scope of the FOIA, failed when Justice had refused to appeal an
earlier court decision declaring these documents to be searchable
under the Mack Allen FOIA request.

2. For background, the sequestered holdings consist of 75 rolls
of microfilm, each roll containing 2,400 frames, or a total of
180,000 pages. In addition, there are 34 cartons (1 square foot
size) containing paper copies of documents. The sequestered
documents contain probably all the material already processed in the
Oswald case and in the Garrison investigation, However, a very
lacge number of documents have never been processed. Many of these
documents originated from requests by the Committee for name checks
of Cuban and other nationals whose names inight have come up in their
own investigation, or in other studies. All this material currently

is stored in the archives.

3. On 4 August, OGC is scheduled to meet at Justice with the
attorney for Mark Allen, Lasar to discuss the disposition of this
material. In this connection, the following points will be raised
by OGC in hopes of reducing the total number of documents that will
have to be processed: : .

: a. We shall attempt to have all non-CIA documents deleted
from this case. This may amount to about one half of the Oswald
documents which were coordinated with us by the FBI. Since other”
Government agencie's documents would be available to the requester
outside CIA, they may agree to that. stipulation.

b. Delete all documents that already have been processed
and to a large extent celeased in other Kennedy litigations,
particularly those being represented by Fensterwald. This would
amount to about 2,000 documents which were treated in the Oswald
(1650 documents) and Garrison case (362 documents).

c. The documents that originated with the Committee,
primarily the notes and memos of staff members, would be regarded
outside the FOIA and not be treated.
