The informant identified one JAKE MORRELLI (phonetic), the RE
proprietor of the Village Owl Social Club, 234 Mulberry St., NYC,

and an individual by the name of "MUMMY" as "button men" under
JOHNNY” BURNS,

It was the informant's impression that both "MUMMY" and
MORRELLI work in behalf of BURNS, who is from Brooklyn, on the
Lower East Side in the Elizabeth St. area,

_ On 4/3/63, spot checks in the vicinity of the residence of
UGO ANTONUCCI’, 531 Palmer Rd., Yonkers, NY, failed to reflect any
pertinent activity. It is felt that additional checks should be
made at this location prior to the attempted development of a
highly confidential source.

The files of a NY Division reflect that NANCYAJAMES also
known as "Chickie"AJAMES formerly operated the StdbTe Restaurant,
I36 W.S6th St., NYC} as a possible "front" for’ hoodlum activities,
JAMES was reportedly arranging dates between girls employed at
the above restaurant and well known celebrities in_NY. Subsequent
investigation failed to indicate any violation of the WSTA Statute.

In view of the fact that the information, describing the subject
as an "insane killer", was received secondhand by NY T-4 and
he was unable to furnish any additicnal details, a caution statement
is not being set forth at the present time,
