EMORANDUM FOR THE.RECORD

The enclosed-electrostatic copies of documents in the John F.
Kennedy Library are the subject of a request for, such copies

from the U.S. Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental
Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities. They are
being submitted to appropriate authority to determine if copies
may be supplied to the Committee. Members of the Committee staff,
Mr. Alan Romberg and Ms. Dorothy C. Dillon, have already seen the
documents when doing research at the Kennedy Library.

The copies are taken from documents in the National Security Files
of the Papers of President Kennedy. The National Security Files
group consists of the working files of the Special Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs, Mr. McGeorge Bundy, and
it is not the records of the National Security Council.

The Kennedy Library has no substantive objection to copies being

provided to the Committee.

Dear Dr. Rhoads:

In accordance with Fritz Schwarz's letter to you of July 14, 1975
and subsequent discussions between the Select Committee staff, members
of your staff, and Mr. Wilderotter, Select Committee staff members have
reviewed materials at the Kennedy and Eisenhower Libraries relating to
Laos and to paramilitary activity in general. It may be necessary to
review some addition of those materials again, but for the moment my
purpose in writing to you is to ask if some of the materials already re-
viewed could be made available to the Committee for our use here in the
Senate. A list of those documents we request for that purpose is attached,
as is a letter to Mr. James Wilderotter on this subject.

All of our staffers who have utilized the facilities at Waltham over
the past several weeks have told me that they have been extremely grati-
fied by the helpful and cooperative attitude of the Kennedy Library per-
sonnel. We are most appreciative of that assistance and also of the
crucial support which your office has provided.

Sincerely yours,

qo.

Dear Mr. Wilderotter:

Following correspondence and conversations between the Committee
and the Administration earlier this month, Committee staff members re~
viewed various materials at the Kennedy and Eisenhower Libraries concerned
with Laos or paramilitary operations in general. As per our agreement,
notes were taken but no copies of any documents were made.

In order to facilitate the work of the Committee, we are asking the
Archivist to make a number of those documents available for our use here
at the Committee. Our letter to Dr. Rhoads, together with the attached
list of requested documents, is enclosed. I would very much appreciate

your assistance in facilitating the provision of. those documents to the
Committee.

In closing, let me add a note of thanks for your willing cooperation
in giving Committee staff access to materials on these areas, as well as
the assassination issue. Assistance in that spirit helps immeasurably
in reaching informed and considered judgments as quickly as possible,
which I think we can all agree is in the national interest.

With best regards.

Sincerely,

David Aaron ™

Dear Mr. Wilderotter:

On Friday, August 15, we received from the Kenne
courier service the documents which David Aa ‘had’ requésted
in behalf of the Church Committee in his let dated July 29,
1975, These are documents from the Kennedy: Presidential papers
which had previously been examined by staff members of the
Church Committee during their visit to the Kennedy Library in”
July.

   

Ly Library. by

 

You advised this office that, since the subject matter of thése.
documents is unrelated to the subject for which a written agree-
mént exists. between the White House and the Church Committee,

it would be necessary for the documents to be reviewed. by the
staff of the National Security Council before being conveyed

for committee use. Accordingly, we are transiitting the docu-
ménts by hand for that review. When you have finished your
review, please return these copies to this office with your
instructions.

The last two documents Listed on David Aaron's request were
not copied and forwarded by the Kennédy Library. They will
be sent down later this week and forwarded to your office.

Sincerely,
RAJ/sb 8/19/75 SL
