on-.either side, and it has.no street or alley behind it. Customarily,
the back yard is clearly illuminated at night by several permanent
spot lights. GABRIEL MANNARINO, his wife, JEAN, and their two
teenage daughters occupy the house.

 

As the Bureau has been notified previously, GABRIEL MANNARINO's
cottage on Old Leechburg Road, in Allegheny Township, Westmoreland
County, Pa., is.a one-story, frame building, which sits back

about 300 feet from the road on a 10 acre tract which slopes

from front to rear. It has a small lake in front of it, and

it is surrounded by wooded area. It has 3 bedrooms, a

kitche, a living-dining room, and a screened porch. To the :
right rear and about 20 feet from the house is a wire. pen, which
holds three German Sheperd dogs... PCI[_______———+i4;?-s who OTHER 4
lives nearby, says there are no private telephone lines in

the area, and it is Jknown that the cottage has no telephone.

From past experience, ‘it is known that GABRIEL MANNARINO almost
never has visitors at his home, especially those having

any connections with racket activities, politics, or law
enforcement. SAMUEL MANNARINO occasionally has visitors of

the above types, but the visits are so infrequent and unpredictable,

confidential source.

With regard to the MANNARINO offices at 1263 Third Avenue,

New Kensington, Pa., it 1s noted that this. is a one story,

red brick building. It is. located completely inside a ten foot:
metal fence which surrounds the scrap metal yard, and it sets
back from the gate, which is locked at night, about 50 feet.

The area between the gate, the scrap piles and the office
building is brightly illuminated by a group of spotlights. .
Recently, it has been determined that this office is protected
by. the Silent Service System, an electronic burglar alarm system
which is. monitored directly by the New Kensington PD. :

 

It would seem that the most likely spot to attempt to establish
a bighly confidential source would be at the MANNARINO cottage, :
but efforts will have to be made to resolve some of. the - (
problems, such as monitoring (the cottage is about 35 miles

from the Pittsburgh Office); ingress (the dogs and a caretaker

whose schedule is irregular) and security (location and coverage

of all possible visitors, and possibility that there is a

burglar-alarm installed).
