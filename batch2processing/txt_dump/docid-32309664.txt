“over whether the [UE or the teamsters union
would represent the workers. About seventy
crossed the picket. line last Thursday with
police escort in and out of the plant.

"TUE members have charged Local 945 of
the teamsters union with importing workers
in an effort to win a representation election.

"A twenty-man police detail, under the
~ direction of Captain Stanley Nowah, remained
at the plant today. Nowah suffered cuts and
several other policemen were injured slightly
in the outburst at the plant last Wednesday and
Thursday. Four men were arrested each day.

NK T-13 advised that the conflict -between team-
sters and the IVE at the Duralite Corporation stems en=-
tirely from ANTHONY "TONY PRO" PROVENZANO's instructions
to BOBBY LUIZZI, the organizer for this newly created
teamsters local, to secure the contract from Duralite
at all costs.

NK T-13 stated that "STRETCH' TRUSSO, the act-
ing shop steward at either Roadway Express or Smith's
Transportation Company, Jersey City, New Jersey, was in
contact with the informant during the early part of
September to determine whether he would be willing to
earn $25 a day protecting the employees of Duralite as
they entered and departed the plaat. NK T-13 stated that
after indicating his willingness to assist in the .
Duralite strike, he proceeded to the Clifton plant on
September 8, 1961, and there met TRUSSO, who appeared to
be acting as the over-all boss of the teamsters men
picketing the plant. While at Duralite NK T-13 observed
a number of known Hoboken criminals in front of the
building harassing the IVE pickets. Among those observed

- were JIMMY SKZENS, SAL SINNO, "CHIC" VANQUESO, CHARLES
GWINNENT, "DUXE" BROWN, and TOMMY MANZI (PH).

located diagonally across the street_from the Duralite
plant and was there informed by BOBBY LUIZZI that all
steamsters men were willing to take an active roll in con-
bating the IVE pickets and would receive $25 daily.

NK T-13 stated that after surveying the situation, he
concluded that violence would eventually break out and
decided not to join the teamsters pickets.
