SUBJECT: GENERAL—
sreciric— Request for Field Traces and Investigations

REF: HRS-W-1326

1. It has been ascertained locally that Identity B and her husband,
a PBPRIME national, own a modest home located 300 yards west and 25 yards
south of the Jefetura Politica in San Juan de Tibés, a suburb of San Jose.
The house is currently occupied by the mother of Identity B and by Identity C,

2. Due to the smallness of the neighborhood in which the house is located,
it was not deemed operationally secure to attempt to make any neighborhood inguir-
ies concerning the family. Identities A, B, and C are all known to the under.
signed who met them first in another Central American country in 1954. The name
Pedro MARZAL was never mentioned by any of them during any conversation with the
writer and the report that Identity B had been married at one time to MARZAL came
as a surprise. It is entirely possible, however, that if she had been married
before there was no reason why she or her husband should tell writer of that fact.

3e A check of all available indices snelnding those of the Costa Rican
government revealed no information on Pedro. His name is not listed in
the current telephone directory. Discreet inquiry of a cleared station informant
concerning MARZAL proved to be negative. He had never heard the name before,

~ 4, It has been ascertained that Identity B applied for a United States
tourist visa at the local United States Consulate on 4 April 1957. In her .
application for the visa, Identity B indicated that she had not been divorced
but was married-to “Identity A. “In all of the fapers-concerifing her Wisz=ap=
plication she gave no indication that she had been married previously. Her
application for the visa indicates that she was born on 15 March 1915 in San
Jose, Costa Rica and that she holds a valid Costa Rican Passport. Discreet
inquiry of an Embassy employee who is in the confidence of this office provided
little information on Identity B. She is known slightly to the employee who
advised he had never heard Subject voice any opinion on politics, either dom-
estic or international.

 

5« Identity C, until recently, was employed as a beautician by a local”
beauty shop named Bordalos, It is known that she requested a week’s leave of
absence from her job in order to take Identity B’s two children to her in an-
other area. Her employer refused to grant the leave and Identity C was forced
| to resign her position in order to take the youngsters to their mother and father.
io Identity B returned to San Jose only recently from this trip and since that time
ue has been seeking employment without success.

HRS-A-2938

. S Biseret’ inquiries of local PBPRIMERS and cleared station informants failed to
reaveal any information concerning Identity C other than that she is a quiet,
attractive girl who has been away from Costa Rica for many years.

6. It has been ascertained that Identity C also applied for a United States
visa on 4 April 1957. In her application, she indicated that she wanted to accom-
pany her sister and the latter ’s children to the United States in order that they
might all join the husband of Identity B. It later developed that the trip was not
made and the visa application cancelled. Her visa application shows that she was
born.on 2 July 1925 in San Jose, Costa Rica, and that she holds a valid Costa Rican

_ passport,

7. Writer recalls that Identity B once told him (in 1954) that during
World War 11 she and Identity C had been employed by one of the Post Exchanges
4n the Panama Canal Zone. Identity B, at that time, said that due to the fact
she was so dark she was paid from the Silver Roll (for Panamanians only) but
that Identity C was paid from the Gold Roll (for white, Americans) at the same
time. Identity B is quite dark, has thick lips, is short and quite plump. Even
with the passing- of ten years, it is difficult to picture her as a dancer during
World War I.

8 A check of the files of the local Guardia Civil, Traffic Department,
and Detective Bureau failed to reveal any arrest record on either Identity B or
