In redation to the above, it is noted that ‘
TONI is the name of BRODKIN's wife. The reference to BERKO '
is apparently a reference to LEO BERKOWICZ, an associate of
STERNMAN in gambling in Montreal]. HARRY GROSSMAN is believed :
to be a NewfYork attorney who resides on Long Island. It is :
, noted that BRODKIN has visited him and stayed on his estate :
| in the past. , ;

I The remark by BRODKIN, "Are the inspectors still
with you?" apparently refers to the fact that, as the Bureau
is aware, STERNMAN is under active surveillance by the Royal

: Canadian Mounted Police. Apparently STERNMAN has learned of

; the investigation and surveillance of him by the RCMP.

Although the Chicago Office has considered
paraphrasing the above conversation and placing it ina
letterhead memorandum for possible dissemination to the RCMP,
it is not felt that this can be done with adequate security
to this source.

EXTREME CAUTION SHOULD BE exercised IN THE USE ;
