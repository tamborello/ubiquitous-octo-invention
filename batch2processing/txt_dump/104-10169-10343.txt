svsecr'| SPECIFIC Transmittal of GAMKITC 1 Clandestine Photographs
22. Taken During Hay"1955

REP: [zava}uis29, 15 August 1955

De 4. Transmitted herewith are 407 clandestine photographs taken by
TOMEC 1 during the month of May 1955, ALL of them wore taken with the
ghest camera” described in the reference and previous correspondence,
The mmbering systen is the same as and a direct continuation of that used
for the initial GR\TOTC 1 photographs transmitted wth the reference,

a OL :

F'9, It should be noted that a considerable proportion of the "take" ¢ - 1
during May was shot at the Trattnerhof in an effort to sccure photographic werd
coverage of USIA officials. It is our hope that it willbe possible some=
time during the near future to show all the Trattnerhof photographs taken
to date (and no more will be taken from now on) to DS 623, If we succeed
-4n this objective, we shall of course report the results to Headquarters
without delay. You will-further note that the photographs Nos. G 32.3
through G 32.13 are not transmitted with the attached. These prints are

‘pow available only in single copy, and will be transmitted after they are

* ghown to DS 623. Additional copies of this series were not printed, since
in general they were of relatively poor suitability for identification work.

3. In general, it is felt that the coverage during Nay shows a distinct
dmprovenent, toth technically and with respect to successful coverage of
targets of interest, over that transmitted along with the reference. At

\Uthe present time, GRITOMIC 1 coverage of sensitive areas is being temporarily
suspended, both in order to avoid burning him through overuse and because
the VOB Technical Support Section, in the midst of its move from GaaTias 9%

te » is not able to process photographs. We intend, as the post-

A occipation Soviet establishment becomes more clearly definable, to deploy

ec 1 against installations of this establishment in order to detenaine
