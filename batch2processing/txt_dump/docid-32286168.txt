On February 27, 1976, CG 9561-CTE advised SA FRANK
J. FORD that JOSEPH AIUPPA (JOEY O'BRIEN) is considered to
; be the current head of. the LCN in the Chicago area. CG 9561-
; CTE advised that ALEX had made an effort to retire several
l " years ago, but was informed by AIUPPA and others that he was
too important a figure in the daily operations of the LCN,
| and therefore could forget “retirement period". .

 

 

CG 9561-CTE described ALEX as being a shrewed business
operator, who has made considerable money for the LCN. ALEX
has numerous connections in City Hall and on the near north
side of Chicago, and is still a source of income for the LCN.
CG 9561-CTE advised the LCN is currently more dependent on
their Las Vegas investments than ever before and for this
reason the LCN has insisted that ALEX supervise their operation
in the Las Vegas area. 4

CG 9561-CTE advised that ALEX has not been known to

> have taken any trips to Las Vegas. Whatever business needs
to be accomplished in Las Vegas is done by TONY SPILOTRO and

others, who are issued instructions from someone in Chicago.

 

On March 16, 1976, CG 9561-CTE advised SA FORD that
ALEX is believed to be very much involved in the receiving and
dispersion of money obtained through skimming in Las Vegas.
CG 9561-CTE stated that SIDNEY KORSHAK continues to he responsi-
ble for the skimming activities for the Chicago LCN.

 

CG 9561-CTE advised that even when ALEX was spending
time in Florida during the winter it became necessary for
ALEX to return to Chicago on several occasions, and always
around the first of the month. By coincidence KORSHAK and ALEX
met in the Chicago area about the first of the month.

CG 9561-CTE is of the belief that the monies trans-
ported from Las Vegas to Chicago are carried by a courier, but
j arranged for by KORSHAK and ALEX.
