‘ Immigration and Naturalization Service at Pittsburgh which

is looking into his Petition for Naturalization. Informant
said that she does not believe LA ROCCA will leave Pittsburgh
as long as he is so close to getting his citizenship status
resolved inasmuch as it has been the foremost thought in his
mind for many years. PG T-3 further advised that LA ROCCA goes

home nightly instead of visiting friends as he used to do

and seems to be generally keeping himself available.

; The aforementioned informant advised that she is now

dating "“RED'GIORDANO, New Kensington, Pa., racketeer, and close
associate of the MANNARINO. brothers (Pittsburgh and national

top hoodlums} . Informant explained that the dates are unscheduled

for the most part and that he usually takes his dates to New
Kensington's gambling establishments which are controlled by the -
MANNARINO brothers. Informant said he knows that she is aware
of his indictment by. a Federal Grand Jury at Pittsburgh as a
co-conspirator in the theft of rifles at a Canton, Ohio, armory
for shipment to Cuban rebels during October, 1958, but never
speaks of this or his other racket activities. Informant said
that although GIORDANO is married, he enjoys dating other

women, and is not afraid to spend money. Informant advised that
he mentions the MANNARINO brothers by name occasionally and has
mentioned the name LA. ROCCA_to her on only one occasion in
connection with a social contact.
