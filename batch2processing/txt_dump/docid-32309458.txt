activities for the past three years, and who has furnished . -.
reliable information in the past, on May 12, 1961, advised that.”
between 30 and 40 Americans arrived in Mi from ‘Texas. on
May 11, 1961. They were reeruited- by ALLE JUSHANE , NE, who
orthwest. 17th —

Court, Miami, Florida, and who “previously” made a trip to
‘Texas to recruit Americans for some future military. action

against the Government of Cuba.

 

MM T-1 advised that these Americans’ from Texas
arrived by automobile and bue, were without funds, were
typical adventurers, not. considered trustworthy, and were

‘disillusioned to find that facilities had not been provided
for them. Some of the recruits from Texas said that while
they were passing through the State of Louisiana, they got
into some difficulty with the police, telephonically |
contacted DUSHANE in Miami for help, but were told there
was no help available to them. After the recruits. arrived
in Miami, they were taken out of Miami to a camp about
‘forty miles west of the city, to a place in the everglades,.
where they established a training camp. MM T-1 advised
that there are now established in the everglades, two
training camps. The first training camp was established by ~
GERALD PATRI NWING, with DICEMWATLEY and OLBY :
running the camp. The second training camp, consisting of
the recruits from Texas, is being run by ALLEN DUSHANE
