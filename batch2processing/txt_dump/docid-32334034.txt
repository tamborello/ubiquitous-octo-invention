is in possession of a passport, which he carries with him
at all-times; that RABIN has stated his intentions’to leave
the country in the event he is successful in attempting the
score described herein above, thereby avoiding a split-of
the loot obtained with GABE MANNARINO and others. Informant
mentioned the possibility that in the event RABIN is
successful in attempting this score, MANNARINO, NORMAN
ROTHMAN, and others may take necessary steps to "get rid"
of RABIN prior to their forthcoming trial on ITSP ¢ vo

- CONSPIRACY charges, in view of their feeling that without

RABIN, MANNARINO and ROTHMAN cannot be successfully prosecuted.

conspiracy charge; and MANNARINO and ROTHMAN had reportedly
made known their intentions to "get rid" of RABIN.

MANNARINO, RABIN, ROTHMAN, et al, who were initially

"BERNIE" had gone as far as Washington, D. C., ultimate
destination not ‘learned, involved a swindle or theft of

a substantial amount of money, all in $10,000 bills.

He learned these bills were reportedly stolen in Japan ~
by a representative of the United States Government shortly
after World War II. Such bills were reportedly brought
into the United States and since then one or two of the”
$10,000 bills was sold at a discount, which sale resulted
in inquiry by the U. S. Treasury Department. As a result
of the inquiry the unidentified person in possession of
these $10,000°bills has been afraid to sell, spend, or
otherwise dispose of same. Informant learned this person
is-reportedly still in the U. S. Government service,
possibly connected with the United Nations. or the U. S.
State Department, and from conversation overheard informant: —
gathered these bills are now or have in the recent past
been stored in a safe deposit box of an unknown branch of
the Manufacturers Trust Company, New York City.

Subjects feel that victim of proposed score,
inasmuch ag he is not in legal possession of the $10,000
bills, would make no complaint of the loss of this money
if the score successful.

MM 722 PC advised on September 19, 1960 that
he learned RABIN was expected in Miami over the week-end
of September 17 - 19, 1960 where, acting on instructions
of GABE (KELLY) MANNARINO, New Kensington, Pennsylvania
racketeer, RABIN was to obtain the fictitious credentials
(mentioned herein above) from someone unknown to informant ,
for subsequent use in pulling above-described score. He
learned nothing of the date or time for this proposed
score.

On September 14, 1960, MM 660-C advised she

learned on JOE MEROLA's recent trip to Roanoke, Virginia,
on August 26, 1960, when MEROLA left Miami he was accompanied
