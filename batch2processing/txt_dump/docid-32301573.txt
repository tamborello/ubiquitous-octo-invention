MOVIMIENTO INSURRECIONAL
DE RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIO

On December 12; 1963, our source in this matter who
hes furnished reliable information in the past learned that
William Johnson, a United States citizen, pilot and businessman
who has been previously involved in’ anti-Castro activities,
rented a twin-engine Beechcraft which is scheduled to be used
in the bombing raid. This airplane is lerated at Broward
International Airport, Fort Leuderdale, Florida, rather than
at Orlando, Florida, as previously indicated. Some consideration |
is being given, however, te using en Areo Commander airplane
located at Broward International Airport instead of the Beechcraft.

g Orlando Bosch Avila, head of the Movimiento
aa Insurrecional de Recuperacion Revolucionario (MIRR), has
En indicated that there may ba some slight postponement of this

°% operation but he has not made any definite announcement of a
S:j change of schedule.
