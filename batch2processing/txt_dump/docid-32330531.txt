MM 174-926

On 1/24/77, MM 3945-C advised that ANDRES PASEIRO,
brother-in-law of MASFERRER, wanted to bring criminal charges
against SA MILLS based on DE ARMAS' statements. 6%)

i
PASEIRO, JOSE ELIAS THUMAS and LUCILA MONTERO MASFERRER,
ROLANDO MASFERRER's widow, were interviewed regarding the
allegation against SA MILLS in late January and early February,
1977.

It is noted that DE ARMAS returned to the United
States in September, 1976, and was interviewed by Special

In the interview DE ARMAS denied any direct knowledge of
MASFERRER's murder, and admitted fabricating this story about
SA MILLS having furnished him with explosives. It is noted
that DE ARMAS alleged that SA MILLS furnished C-4 for the
MASFERRER killing, when in fact dynamite was used. DE ARMAS,
who appears to be a pathological liar, also told Homicide
detectives of the Dade County Public Safety Department in Miami
that the information he furnished about SA MILLS is false. K(W)

Because of MASFERRER 's involvement with the violent
element in the Miami area and the possibility that his friends
and followers may have believed DE ARMAS' story and could
retaliate in some violent way against SA MILLS or his family,
it was decided by the Miami Office that an interview of Mrs.
MASFERRER and her brother-in-law was proper to evaluate the
possibility of a threat to SA MILLS or his family. SAs
FREDERICO VILLALOBOS and ROY L. MOBLEY, JR. were instructed
to interview Mrs. MASFERRER, ANDRES PASEIRO and JOSE ELIAS
THUMAS, aka Jose Elias Nacin. (Copy of FD-302s regarding -
these interviews are enclosed). ‘

It is noted that NACIN is a member of a violent
terrorist organization named "Pragmatistas" and was recently :
convicted in Miami of conspiracy to commit murder. This
involved the shooting death of LUCIANO NIEVES, a well-known .
Cuban exile in Miami.
