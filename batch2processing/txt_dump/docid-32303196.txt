SUBJECT: SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka. . \
. AR x
It is noted that currently SAMUEL MANNARINO is in wi
in connection with his trial in USDC in the case captioned,
"BERNARD J. EZHAYA, ET AL; ITSP - MT." OTHER 4
C7- 4245 ;
it is recalled that in August, 1961, (_____] former
CI of the Miami Office, was interviewed in Miami. by
SAs JOHN S. PORTELLA and THOMAS G. , III of the
Pittsburgh Division. At that time advised that
MANNARINO was a cocaine "sniffer" on a regular basis.

 

On 2/14/62, Departmental Attorney JOHN MULLANEY advised
SAC B. C. BROWN that he felt that the possibility that
MANNARINO could be proven to be a user of narcotics was
worth exploring. He suggested that Pittsburgh Division
attempt to ascertain whether or not MANNARINO uses
narcotics during his irregular visits to the Pines Motel, ob
Route 56, Leechburg, Pa.,; and he said he believed the ii
Chicago Office should try to make the same determination; ;
as regards MANNARINO's stay in the hotel in Chicago. i

Arrangements have been made for SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III
. to take’ an agent of the Federal Narcotics Bureau from
Pittsburgh to examine the room used at the Pines Motel, y
Leechburg, Pa., if MANNARINO does, in fact, use it on
G@ evening of 2/17/62.
