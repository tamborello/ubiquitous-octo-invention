Dear Herr Heigl:

I refer to our conversation of 29/10/74 and your written
assignment of 5/11/74 and set forth in the following the
principles of poly-symptomatic resemblance analysis based
on

ANTHROPOLOGICAL IDENTITY EVALUATION

whether the persons, Frank Stergis and Howard Hunt are
identical to persons shown in comparative photographs.

SUBJECT : German Magazine A to Tie Howard Hunt/
Frank Sturgis to the Dallas Assassination of
President Kennedy

1. Recent publicity against CIA in the U.S. has stim-
lated the German weekly Der Stern to intensify previous
efforts to tie Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis to the Dallas
assassination of President Kennedy. According t&(CASHAKER/1,
a cooperative Senior editor of Stern;) the magazine plans to
fly reporter Gérd Heidemann to Dailas about 9 January for
interviews. The reporter working on the story at Stern,
Frank Heigl, claims to be in touch with "dissident CIA
staffers who were forced out after Dallas." Heigl sup-
posedly picked up these contacts in Ankara and Frankfurt.

2. In October 1974, Der Stern paid Dallas photographer
Jack Beers $1,000 for copiés of pictures he had taken of
persons being led away by the police from the book deposi-
tory after the assassination cf President Kennedy. The naga-
zine was attempting to identify Watergate defendants Hovard
Hunt and Frank Sturgis with persons shown in the Dallas
photographs to build up a story implying Hunt (and by
inference CIA) involvement in the assassination. To buttress
this conjecture, the magazine hired Professor Rainer Knuss-

-_mann of the Anthropological Institute of the University of

Hamburg to do a "scientific" comparison of the Dallas photos
with stock shots of Hunt and Sturgis. His findings are that
there is a high probability that Hunt and Sturgis could be
identical with two persons shown in the Dallas snapshots

and that the matter should be pursued further. A summary
translation of the Knussmann findings is attached.

ad. Conclusions

The given question about the identity of
Stergis and Hunt with the two designated persons on the
Death Site (DS) pictures can only be answered clearly to.
the extent that a firm identity denial is not possible from
the photographic documentation placed at my disposal. In
this connection there is a noticeable discrepancy in the
amount of protrusion of the ear in the photos of the man
who could be Hunt which, however, fails by far to be suf-
ficient for a sure negative identification.

In all, the resemblance analysis with
respect to both persons led to a clear majority of positive
resemblance factors, which above al] for Stergis were in
part very convincing. Since it concerned a clearly estab-
lished similiarity in relatively rare distinguishing marks.
Because of the indifferent quality of the source photos
which handicaps a scientific comparison and because of
unsimiliarities which cropped up in the course of the
analysis--though these were nearly all of minor nature

.--the total result is not adequate for the establishment

of an zbsolutely sure identity. Such a result from photo
materizls such as were furnished me is in principle very
diffic.1t to achieve. The symptoms of identity neverthe-
less are so convincing that it must be advised in any case
that the material be pursued further. A successful identity
establishment could truly be expected if photos of Stergis
and Hunt, which should be- obtainable, were prepared .

the subjects from the same head angle and under similiar
lighting as in DS photos.

The probable ‘identity from the resemblance analysis
is given a special weight because the margin of error is
Significantly reduced when both Hunt and Stergis are
analyzed in combination. This is on the common sense ground
that while an accidental resemblance between Stergis or Hunt

‘on the one side and one of the persons shown in the DS pictures

would be understandable, there is a very narrow probability
that Stergis accidentally resembles one and Hunt accidentally
the other of both persons shown in the DS photos.

Possibly what is finally expected of me is a precise
probability quotient for the possible identity of Stergis and

‘Hunt with.the:.questioned.persons on the DS-pictures. Such

a numerical probability estimate can certainly be produced

by mathematics, but would show a false exactness. However,
to give a preliminary evaluation I estimate that the positive
resemblance between Stergis and the questioned person #1 in
74-00000 7

the DS photos has a probability of 0:1 (10% error, that is
.90% for an identity). The similiar value for Hunt being
person #2 I estimate at 0.3 (that is 30% chance of error
and 70% probability of identity). From this a theoretical
error probability for the combined results figures at only
0.03 (that is 3%, therefore, 97% probability).

In closing I should Like to assure you that in prepa-
ration of this evaluation I have taken pains to work according
to the best conscience and knowledge without any political
presumptions. I hope I have served you with my evaluation |
and send you my sincere respects.
