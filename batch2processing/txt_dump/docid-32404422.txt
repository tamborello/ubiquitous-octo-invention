‘CIA SPECIAL:COLLECTIONS
RELEASE IN FULL
2000

27 October 1993

NOTE FOR: D/CSI
FROM: John Carver

SUBJECT: Answers for Dave Christian (and Jim Wolf, Reuter)

I gave Dave the following figures today, updating those
used by the DCI in his testimony to Congress on 28
September, so he could be prepared to talk to the Reuter
reporter.

We did in fact transfer 125,000 pages of HSCA
sequestered Agency files on JFK to NARA by 22 August (a
Sunday), meeting the statutory deadline. We were the only
agency to meet the deadline. NARA made these available to
the public within a week.

As to the 20,000 pages of HSCA-originated material in
Agency files, HRG was about half way through the review of
this when we were overtaken by the higher priority placed by
the DCI on review of the Microfilm material. Thus,
processing was interrupted, but will resume ASAP once the
microfilm job is complete. (We do have the proper
authorization from Congress--the House Administration
Committee--but, physically, this material will be delivered
to NARA's JFK Task Force, which is the agent for HAC.)

The story on the 7,000 pages of "third agency
material"--that originating in FBI and about 15 other & is \.
agencies--is similar. This, too, was partly completed, but )
is not our highest priority until the Microfilm job is done. nmnd
- om

As to the 10,000 pages of material earlier postponed in Lae
full in the first review, we can now say that 90 percent cx pee TO)
will be released to NARA, but here again, processing has pe
been slowed by the Microfilm job. We will not make the date
suggested by the DCI in his testimony (28 October), Xbut all
of this should be done and transferred within a matter of
weeks, in any case certainly by 1 January.

The top priority job for HRG--the 150,000 pages of
material on microfilm--has all been printed out and all
available manpower is concentrated on reviewing this massive
set of records. We will be ready for Assassination Records
Review Board examination of_all this terial by 1 January.

We still plan to ask tor-pestpchenent CFs major share ote
this on grounds of privstyoSoncerns~ fon-germaneness,
sources and methods, and foreign sensitivities.

Journalists should be reminded that everything for
which the Agency will be asking for postponement under the
provisions of the JFK ARCA, both that denied in full -and
that presented in sanitized form, will be shown in its
original unredacted state to the ARRB, without exception, as
required by the Act. Thus, there will be an outside
authority making sure that the Agency's requests for
continued protection of information fully meet the criteria
set down in the Act.
