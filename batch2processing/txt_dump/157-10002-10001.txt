OCCURRENCE? Hielms testified that the aim of the Cuban operations was "to
get rid of Castro or the Castro regime in Cuba; lets put it that way, and no
limitations were placed on the means. In fact, T never recall havine been told by

anybody do not do this, do not do that, do not do the other thing." (26) (The

above statements refer to_ Mongoose.) Ilelms testified that "the pressure was very
intense and I remember vividly it was very intense." The pressure led to several
“very nutty schemes." (26) elas testified the pressure built up to the Ray of Pip
and then lag dormant for awhile and intensified again toward the end of 1961 and
1962. The Cuban tHissile Crisis itself was the period of ereatest intensity. After-
wards interest tapered of f, although Helms recalled cfforts in 1963 involving
“economic warfare" such as turning of f_oi] dcliverics and stoppine bus deliveries
including an attempt to stop the sale

A similar project was noted for jet fuel storage-tanks in Cuba.

Larisdale noted that the CIA had concluded that its realistic role should be to at least
create the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support for it, to improve

CIA operational capability, and to help create a climate which will permit provocative
actions in support of a shift to overaction. Lansdale wanted them to reevaluate

to see whether or not they could make a greater effort. An outline of what the 33 tasks
are for each of the entitities involved then follows in Lansdale's memo. ‘The memorandum
notes that the President directed that the Chief of Operations conduct the project through

OCCURRENCE: The planning for Operation MONGOOSE was prepared on a format of separate

planning for each department and agency involved. Revised planning along that line was
submitted with this memorandum. Activities already approved were marked with an asterisk.
Approved were dispatching one intelligence agent operation to a key area selected by the
CIA, (Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained for paramilitary skills

as well as intelligence collection,.,.However, CIA has noted that, once the agents are
inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort

will be made to attempt such control.") (00207), Carri er cpa-Locka,
Florida. Periodic intelligence estimates, continued help in con-
taminating locamotive lubricants, two teams of agents dispatched to Cuba approved for

March 16-31, 1962, develop intelligence potential of Cuban "colonies" in U.S., develop
additional interrogation centers in other areas by 31 March 1962 in South America and
