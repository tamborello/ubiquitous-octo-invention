The: group formed -by Léon, David ana 2 otnels: left from Florida
at dawn of 11 August.on the mothership "Kilo", ~towing the boat to be
used in the infiltration, which we will call Pedro".

The mother ship went near the banks of Cay Sal, anchoring -and-re=
maining there until mid-afternoon. We proceeded in. examining: "Pedro";
finding that the drain corks were out of place and that.therée was ap-
proximately 5 inches of water in the boat. ~ We took out. the-water and
put the corks in their:places. We tried out the main moton and placed
the gasoline tanks ‘under the seat of the helmsman and under the lateral
Seats (total of 3).

At- sundown, "Kilo" went towards the destination point, arriving at
about 10: p.m. to the chosen point, that is, approximately 2.miles north
ofthe narrow channel. called Empalizada. Here we installed the remain-—
ing gas tanks, the silent motor and the equipment. We left for the en-~
trance of the channel using the silent motor which, due to. poor func~«
tioning in the intake of gasoline, stopped several times, so we decided
to use the main motor.

After an exploration necessary to. locate the channel again, because
the boat drifted while we were stopped, we entéred it and followed the
pre-established route. We only encountered two boats which were quite
far away, at the entrance of the Santa Clara bay. Once there, we went
to the. Concunil lagoons where we ran into a white fishing boat-with-a
Sail mast. (it was later proved that it belonged to a militia informer),
so we decided to go-to the nearest point of the entrance to firm land,
through the so-called Three Towers..lagoon (Tres Torres), which joins
the Santa Clara Bay by the narrow channel called Lolo. In this place,
an entrance was. selected (away from the principal. lagoon). This en-
trance was approximately -as wide as the boat, and its shores were
covered with high and thick: mangroves that covered the boat. pretty well.
As ah additional precaution, we used them to camouflage the boat by
taking a roof for it. . The boat was located in the middle of -a-mangrove
swamp without. firm land, approximately 1.5 kms from the Santa Clara Bay
and 2 kms from firm land.

In the afternoon of the 13th, the entrance of a fishing boat was
detected. It had a motor of the type called "planta". (1-eylinder 12
h.p.), about 18 feet long, with a 3 member crew, and also a small
"chapin" type boat. (punt or dory), which the fishermen wv Lly-use: for
their, work in that area. The owner of the boat identi bch as.
Isaac¥MOREN. RENO who was accompanied by his father, Felici O and 4.
by a nephew. Since these people were known to us; we: approaches chon /
and upon learning that they were willing to help us in our étivities,
they were asked to fish that day, and go to their dopartyngpoint,
which was Menendez beach, where they were to contact Oscar®§DEAZ and
send him to the lagoon. The exact location of our boat was not "ree
vealed. to them. *

at-nightfall, where they were received by Antonio Garcia. Moments later
the car arrived and the infiltrees went to a mechanic's workshop: lo-

ff. All-the planes flew at about.2000 ft. They were
single engine and twin motor planes ‘but no other

that.a boat from Miami had come to pick up: some 30
persons. One of these had abandoned his car in the

1. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITY

Bey

wn S
3 Project..activity during the first eight days Of Be

5 Rer can-only be described as hectic. As September began,

» AMPRUNK=9, who Had been exfiltrated on 23 August, was. being
“nushed through tradecraft and Fi training, being further de-~
‘Briefed and briefed, and trained in S/W and OWVL in preparation
for his re-infiltration on 9 September. At the saine time, com-
plications arose over AMTRUNK-9's POA when his first LCFLUTTER
turned out inconclusively and when it was.discovered that ODIBEX
had laid prior claim.to his services... The difficulty over the
LCFLUITER was straightened out following a ‘second LCFLUTTER test
at which time the results. were much clearer to’ read and indicated
no deception. ODIBEX relinquished -all claim to AMTRUNK-9 after
the Station had granted an interview to-an ODIBEX case officer
with AMTRUNK-9 in order that.A~9 could. be debrieféed on his ‘knowl-
edge of AMFAUNA-~3's activities. At. the same time KUBARK offered .
tO assist ODIBEX by exfiltrating AMFAUNA-3.on the same operation
during which AMTRUNK-9 would be infiltrated.

In’ the'midst. of the rush to train and hold operational dis«
cussions with AMTRUNK-~9, a newspaper article on changing trends
among high: Level personnel within the AMTHUG-1 government written
by AMCAPE-1 appeared in a major daily newspaper. AMCAPE~1 re- ;
portedly told a high level ODYOKE official that. AMICE~27,. the
AMTRUNK team -leader, was the source of his information. . The de+
briefing of AMICH-27 had produced information at considerable
variance to that in AMCAPE~l's article. Confronted with ‘the ar-—
ticle, AMICE-27 admitted talking to AMCAPE-~1 but. denied that most
of the information in the article was based on. d@ything which
AMICE~27 had said. As this article was creating considerable
furor’ in ZRMETAL, Irving: INS escorted AMICE=27 on 5 Septem-

ber to Z2RMETAL for furth sb g8'nd operational discussions, -

Discussions with Headquarters personnel were held on 5 and 6
September, during which AMICE~27 continued to. stick to exactly
the same story which he had given during his JMWAVE debrief-
ings. These discussions also covered the future direction

and scope of:the AMTRUNK project. No concrete meeting of af

 
   
 
      
    

minds between KUBARK officers, and AMICE<~27 was obtained dur-
ing these two-days. It was agreed that the discussions would
continue in the JMWAVE area. _ —

 
  

   
  
    
 

    
   

On-late.6 September, AMI 27 proceeded alone to New
York City ‘to ‘contact {D: RILLO Gomez, former coman~
dante in.the Rebel Army and personal phySician of AMTHUG-1,
to ask him to come to the JMWAVE area for discussions with ;
AMTRUNK~9 and KUBARK officers on the general. AMTRUNK concept.
At the same time, PEGGINS and Willard R. NAUMAN from Head-
quarters returned to the WAVE area. On 7 September AMICE~27
accompanied by TRILLO arrived in that area. . Discussions con-
tinued in the safehouse during 7 and 8 September.

 
  

   
    
 

      
   
   
 
 
 

  

At-the same time, preparations were going forward to
infiltrate AMTRUNK~9 and to exfiltrate AMFAUNA-1,~3 and-34,
AMICE-14 was to be acting team leader for this operation, ac-
companied by the two team guides, AMTRUNK~7 and-8. Late on

8 September AMICE-27 escorted TRILLO to the airport for his
return to New. York...Several hours later the infiltration
team.consisting of AMICE+-14, AMTRUNK~7, -8 and -~9 were loaded
on board the M/V Neptune for their infiltration scheduled for
the following evening, 9 September. The infiltration of
AMTRUNK~9 and the exfiltration of four AMFAUNAs (AMPAUNA~13 was
included. in the exfiltration party at the last moment). went: off
very smoothly. Attached herewith as Attachment A is AMICE-14's -
log_of this operation. Due to the fact. that the infiltration
area was up because of an exile refugee infil in the
same area, AMICE-~14 decided to clear the area ohne night
earlier than scheduled. .He therefore headed straight for
Marathon, arriving the following morning within one mile of
that town... At this point he had the misfortune to run out
of gas, to be picked up by the Coast Guard, and to be. towed
into the. town dock where the boat was greeted by police,
newspaper photographers and tourists. This. created consi-~
derable stir but the team was eventually picked up from local
authorities. by the case officer without any team identities
becoming: known. Through liaison with two.local newspapers,
all photographs showing identifiable team member faces were
suppressed and obtained for Station files. The rather
spectacular nature of the AMTRUNK re-entry at Marathon some~
what obscured the precise, professional manner in which the
team had carried out its assigned task during the entire
mission, including the feat of sailing a.16' Boston Whaler
with seven persons aboard across some 120 miles of ocean.

     
 

  
 
    
   
     
 

   
    
 
 
  

  
    
     
        
    
     
         
   
     
   
     
 

During the latter half of the reporting period consi+-
derable discussion continued between the case officers and
AMICE-27 as to the future direction of the-operation. AMILCE-27
continued to hold out for very grandio chemes! Inp.vessence jj
he wanted carte blanche to recruit more infil-exfil agents,
to organize: an-amorphous Rebel Army group in exile, to re~ {
cruit, train and dispatch PM teams for resistance and. sabotage “
on the inside, to establish a commando unit on the outside, 9°"
and. to run a propaganda program beamed from PBPRIME. into
Cuba. At one point in these discussions the COS, JMWAVE,. was
introduced to AMICE-27 and laid out the general parameters as
to the Station's interest in AMICE-27's ideas. By. the end

of the senonting seried.ve-hid basn_able—to-reduta QNICE-27
