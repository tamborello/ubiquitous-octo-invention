Executive Committee include in the program a request for
the membership to buy tickets to a banquet and dance to
be held at the Casa Cuba Club on December 15, 1962, LEE y

| stated that the banquet and dance is being held to raise
funds for the defense of three Cubans who have been arrested
for sabotage. LEE stated that the request should be toned
down so that it would not seem that the FPCC was undertaking

_ the defense of the three Cubans. LEE said that the attorney
for the Cubans had asked him not to get too involved in
the defense as it would not help his case by having the
FPCC involved. CAC
