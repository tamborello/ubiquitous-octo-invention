Illinois, appeared at the Chicago ¢ Office of the
Bureau of

‘ed
Investigation on February se Neer shortly 3 J f-
after he had a brief meeting with Joseply\Werhelle, in .
Chicago, and furnished the following information? o-— 2<—<=" :

He has been talking to Verhelle by telephone
on an average of two or three times a week for the past
month or so, . During these conversations, Verhelle
mentioned that four people would probably testify for the
defense at the Chattanooga trial of Hoffa and if these
people testified he, Verhelle, would also probably
have to testify. The testimony was believed to introduce
in the Hoffa trial that the Justice Department would
stop at. nothing to get Hoffa, and as an example, would
refer to the situation at the Public Bank of Detroit
which was ruined by the fact that a ‘horde: of examiners
came into the bank which caused Verhelle to leave the
bank with the result that the inefficient new management
caused the bank's downfall, Verhelle blames the Justice ,
Department for ruining the Public Bank,

Verhelle mentioned today that a State of Michigan
Banking Commissioner went to Washington, possibly recently,
and visited the Justice Department and talked. to the
Attorney General and let it be known that he believed the
Justice Department was carrying on a vendetta against
Hoffa which, in turn, caused the persecution of the
Public Bank of Detroit.

No identities of new potential defense witnesses
were mentioned by Verhelle, however, Verhelle stated that
it was decided that he now would not testify in Chattanooga,

Re: JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; Etc.

got the impression, however, that someone will
probably testify as to the Public Bank of Detroit situation
to show that the government is going all out against Hoffa
_ and it could be possible the above mentioned Banking
Commissioner will be the person to testify.

i ' :
Ware and Verhelle met with RobertjCole, of the
Chicago’ realty firm of Hogan.and..Farwell,’\in Cole's office,

Building in Chicago, Cole told them that the New York
Life Insurance Company could not take a parellel
mortgage on this building, therefore, it appears there
will be no further action on the purchase of the
building by Verhelle or himself, Cole also mentioned

a New York City building which he did not identify in
which Verhelle expressed an interest and Verhelle is‘ to
recontact Cole in the next week or two. Verhelle also
mentioned to Cole that if other properties having a good
yield were located, that he, Verhelle, would buy them.
