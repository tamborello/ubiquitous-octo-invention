‘County Deputies on June 30, 1959. JAFFE said that he

personally knew nothing concerning CARBONELL, but that a
friend of ROLANDO MASFERRER's brought CARBONELL to MASFERRER
recently?

On July 3, 1959, MARIANO FAGET, 75 S. W. 32nd
Court Road, Miami, former Chief of the Bureau for the
Repression of Communist Activities (BRAC), informed
SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR. that CARBONELL was leaving that day
for Cuba. FAGET expressed the belief that CARBONELL
may have been an informant planted by CASTRO'’s Government
against MASFERRER.

On September 4, and 9, 1959, RICHARD B. JAFFE ,
PSI Under Development , Miami,. confidentially voluntarily
informed that it is a reasonable assumption on the basis
of information obtained from MASFERRER that shortly after the
middle of September, 1959, -thege would be wide spread —
terrorist activities against the CASTRO Government in
Pinar del Rio Province. JOE CARBONELL of Miami had been
receiving instructions from MASFERRER relative to this
activity in Pinar del Rio Province and had ae, one or more

_trips to Cuba in connection with this matter.

: On August 20, 1959, JOSE CARBONELL telephonically
contacted SA LEMAN L. STAFFORD, JR. and stated he desired
to see him away from the premises of the Miami Office. He
was interviewed that date by SAS STAFFORD and ROBERT E.
SUNKEL at which time he furnished the following information
confidentially:

He related that while he had previously
sympathized with the Communist Party, he now realized how
wrong he had been in his sympathies. He stated he now felt
that he wanted to do something as.a service to the United
States Government in helping to combat Commmism in Cuba.
and that it was his feeling that the Cuban Government ‘of.
FIDEL CASTRO was. filled with persons of Communist leanings .
and sympathies, although he could furnish little specific
information regarding the allegation, yu
