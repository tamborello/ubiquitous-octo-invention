RE: Dallas letter to the Bureau dated 9/6/62.

By letter to the Bureau dated 12/8/61, the Houston
office reported that contacts with established sources in
the Houston area at that time failed to reveal any informa-
tion from any source which would indicate the existence of.
this organization in the Houston area. This matter has been
discussed with various sources of the Houston Office. in
recent months, and these sources: continue to report no ..‘..
knowledge of this organization being active at Houston.

A review of referenced Dallas letter discloses
lead for’ Houston was based on. information attributed to
ormer DL 18-S who stated there were individuals sympathetic
to the "Minutemen" in the Houston area. He(ur

Ria is noted the information attributed to this
former informant is non-specific in nature and consists of
general statements apparently based on remarks made by
ROBERT DE PUGH of Missouri #eyhile it is a matter of common
knowledge that there are numefous individuals in the Houston
area who are active in ultra-conservative organizations such
as the National Indignation Convention, there has been no
indication any of these individuals have any specific plans
to use force or otherwise engage in violent or illegal
activities.
