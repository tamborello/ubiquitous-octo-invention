has furnished reliable information in the past, advisedsthat
he had learned the following concerning a contact betw
Frank Barry, registered agent for the Government of Nicaragua | ;
and[Osear Banilo Sanson+Roman, Counselor, Embassy of Nicaragua?’ /(g) j

Barzy indicated that he had reeghtiy seturned to

Washington, B. C., and referred to a recent article by news-
per columnist Drew Pearson in which Barry was mentioned.
Whithough. jie is not identify the individual by name, [Sanson-Roman

said that is certain of the identity of the source of !
gold thee) information. because the individual he believes to ,
be Pearson's source shares an office with Jack Anderson,
Pearson's partner.

Barry noted that Pearson said hé got the information
“he published from a “foreign agents report". LSanson-Roma Ag
not believe this, and both agreed that such information i
contained in ("foreign agent's reports*. ©

It is noted that I.- Irving Davidson, registered
agent for Nicaragua, shares an office with Jack Anderson.

In. reference. to the source of Pearson's tnfo¥mation
garey éontinued that he got his start in everything from "old
General Somoza".. He said this person was starving to death,

and that everything he has he owes either to the Somozas or
to Barry. [Sencon-Roman commented that|@pld General Somoza*
even gave the individual being discussed the/down payment for

his home. | 3) i

The informant could not explain or elaborate on.

put in that three hundred and some thousand dollars that he
got, well I-never put in the donation because I have nothing
~ to do with the donation, they gave it themselves."

oe [Sanson-Roman commented that neta visited the B.
' Protocol Office at the United States Department of State (USDS),
‘the morning the Pearson article appeared; At the USDS, there
“was comment to the effect that Latin American countries could ;
conceivably give $1,000,006 to the Democratic Party (DP). Those
making the comment reasoned by citing the example that if the
Latin American countries new see that the Semozas gave $19,000
to the OP, it follows that other countries will try to better
Nicaragua's donation. ;larry felt that such a situation i
good|and Sanson-Roman feOmmented that the Deputy Chief of fi
Protocol, USDS, told Rim that he does not. consider it a
situation because the Nicaraguan Government does not have to
reply to Pearson's article, inasmuch as President Kennedy was ;
pnaware that the Somozap,gavé $10,000 to his campaign. ~ TV: |
(Sanson-Ronan continued{@owever, that the Deputy Chief of
Protocol pointed out that in spite of the actual circumstahcés
the article will cause people to believe that the Somozas' .
donation had influenced the United States aid to Nicaragua. -

(Senson-Roman conjectured, thad’Qn spite of an
-attempt of the part of Pearson's source to hurt Barry, it has
ail turned out for the best. :

© both] barzyLand Sanson-Roman 2 read that Nicaraguatg) |
would have beéh in a very bad situation if it had given the

denationste Richard Nixon, the Republican candidate for the
Presidency. Barry indicated that he is going to insist that
Nicaragua take the Nicaraguan Agency away from the individual
under discussion and described him as crazy for money with a J
desire to be a second Jimmy Hoffa.. Hoffa is President of the -
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehouse-
i men and Helpers.

b _in vegard to the above, it is noted that on

February 13, 1963, "The Washington Post Times Herald" carried
h an article by Drew Pearson which reported that United States
\! Senate probers had unearthed two political contributions from
I Loiss and Anastasio Somoza, President and Secretary of Defense
} _of Nicaragua respectively. One contribution was described as
a $10,000 donation to the 1960 presidential- campaign of .
