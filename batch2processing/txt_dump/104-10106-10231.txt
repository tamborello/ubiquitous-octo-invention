Dear Mr. Vest:

This will acknowledge receipt of copies of
the repair estimates which you received from Curtis
Chevrolet and Loving Chevrolet, Inc., in the amounts
of $187.49 and $188.90, respectively. Confirming our
telephone conversation of this afternoon, we understand
you wish to have the repairs made by Loving Chevrolet,
and of course my client has no objection to this. Accord-

; release. I am forwarding two copies of the release

VY with the request that you have the original signed in
the presence of a Notary Public and return it to me in
the enclosed self-addressed envelope, retaining the
other copy for your files. This is a standard form of
release used by this office, which I have altered to
exclude any réference to bodily injury since this was
solely a property damage accident. It is only neces~
gary that you have one witness, who can be the Notary.

Again, may I offer apologies on behalf of

letter of August 11 to Mr. vest, and copies of the two
estimates of damage which Mr. vest forwared to us.

Mr. Vest was not at all vindictive, and in
fact indicated he was sorry he had caused
any difficulty, but had summoned the police upon the
advice of an Assistant State's Attorney of Montgomery
County who happened to be a witness to the accident.

Mr. Vest is completely satisfied with the adjustment ©
of his damages, and I explained to him that
was charged and elected to forfeit collateral, and I

feel certain that if Mr. Vest had had his way, there
would not have even been a necessity for a charge.

The Montgomery County Police Department was
most cooperative and the police officer is now in pos~ ;?
session of sufficient information to satisfy him con-
cerning the disposition which was made.

I am of the opinion that the disposition was
completely favorable, and I am pleased that we were able
to be of some assistance o you in this matter. I believe
I discussed wit Yehat an accident report would
probably have to be filed with the Department of Motor
vehicles, and he may have attended to this. If not, I

suggest some representative of your office check with
the local police to determine whether an accident report

must be filed in this situation, apd if so, that the same

be prepared and filed on behalf of LOT
Inasmuch as nothing further remains to be done

by this office, we are closing our file, and we would

simply request that you issue your check in the amount

of $189.90, made payable to my firm as reimbursement for

payment of damages made to Mr. Vest. I prefer not to

make any charge for professional services renderedvin this
particular matter. :

 

With kindest regards) I am,

Very truly yours,

Re: (—————"s. State of Maryland

Dear Mr. Greaney:

This will confirm the fact that after discussions ,
with the investigating officer and Lieutenant Colonel Miller ’
of the Montgomery County, Police, Pepartment, a single traffic
citation was issued eof charging him
with failure to reduce“Speed to avoid a collision, which
is a violation of the motor vehicles,aws of the State.

On August 14, 1969, I met with nd representa-—
tives of.your agency at the {wheaton-Glenmont} police station
anal igned the traffic citation and posted and
forfeited $18.00, representing a fine of $15.00 and $3.00
costs. This is equivalent to a conviction, but avoids the
necessity of any Court appearance. When a record of this
conviction is forwarded to the Department,pf Motor Vehicles
they will assess three points agains ut this
should not result in any action being taken against him by
the Department.

 

 

 

Following conversations with the owner of the
damaged vehicle, Mr. James E. Vest, we determined that a
fair and reasonable charge for repairs to his automobile
would be $188.90, and consequently we forwarded to him
by letter of August 11 our check in the amount of $189.90,
representing the agreed amount of damage together with
$1.00 for expenses in connection with Notary fees for
the execution of the general release which we prepared.

I enclose herewith the original and one executed
copy of the general release, together with a copy of my
