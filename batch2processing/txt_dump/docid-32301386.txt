NY 3461-C-TE and NY 3864-C-TE both advise
they are acquainted with DE MINO ‘and advise he is a
member of "La Causa Nostra". In addition, NY 3461-C-TE
had advised he knows of a "Little Joey", who is a member of
the MAGLIOCCO "family", however, this "Little Joey" has been
identified as JOSEPH VITACCO,

In view of the fact that NY 169-C is not a
member of "La Causa Nostra", since he has not furnished
any information concerning GIAMARINO since 1957, and since
GIAMARINO is unknown to informants who are members of
"Ta Causa Nodra" and who are acquainted with GIAMARINO's
alleged associates, this investigation is considered as a
closed by the NYO at. this time, In the event GIAMARINO
is identified or any further information is received by
the NYO, which would indicate membership in "La Causa
Nostra", this will immediately be reopened,
