1, Reference forwarded (J) a poor quality reduced size photo~
graph of a Cuban Visa Application in the name of Lee H, Oswald with
a handwritten notation in the lower left corner that appears to read

| | "Hotel del Cameron(?)/Room 18 46-60-51(7}", (2) enlarged photograph,

unknown size, of signature "S, de Duran", and (3) Xerox copy of Volume
3 of the exhibits in the "Investigation of Assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, November 22, 1963", containing handwriting specimens of Lee
Harvey Oswald. It was requested that an effort be made to determine if
Silvia Duran or Lee H. Oswald wrote the notation in the lower left corner

of the visa application,

f

2. There are several obstacles, or deficiencies in evidence,
which preclude reaching an un-qualified opinion in this matter, such as
the extreme poor quality of the reduced size (estimated to be about .3X to
5X) photograph of the visa application as opposed to the enlarged Duran
signature, and the absence of comparable letters in the two writings.

3. Nevertheless, careful examination and comparison of ail of
the writing leads to the following opinion: There is enough similarity
between the writing in the signature "S. de Duran" and the questioned
notation on the visa application to make it appear probable that Duran
placed the notation on the application, Or, stating it another way: I
would not eliminate her as a suspect writer of the notation, Examination
of the original documents might remove these qualifications. ®

Document Number 866-29

for FOIA Review on JUL 1976

[ 4, Ido not find enough similarity between Oswald's writing and
the questioned notation to warrant a suspicion that he is the author.
