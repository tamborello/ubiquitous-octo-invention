that he would know them and be able torecognize them and to
have nothing to do with them at any time. He stated that
following his viewing of the photos, MALLAMO told him that he.
wanted him to work as a lookout at the C.M.A.S. Club, and he
stated that it is his impression hat that. was the reason
MALLAMO wanted the informant to know the Agents, so that he
could readily recognize and identify them should they come
to the Club that evening for any reason. Informant further —
stated that when MALLAMO showed him the photos, he took them

ee QO.

CV 157-127

was questioned as to the origin of the photos, and he advised
that he asked MALLAMO where he cbhtained them, and MALLAMO. :
a told him they were copied from a newspaper photo. Informant
stated, however, that he could not be sure that the photos
were copies from a newspaper, in that they were clear and
were not full length photos, and only were from the waist up.

 

Regarding the possibility of MALLAMO being questioned
at. any time by local authorities, and the possibility of ;
_lecating these photos, this. would seem rather doubtful at this

time. In view of MALLAMO's association and influence with
officers, of the Youngstown PD, it is rather improbable that
he will be picked up and questioned by local authorities.

It is further to be noted that CV-278-C-TE stated he has
heard that MALLAMO committed a murder in Youngstown in the
late 1920's or early 1930's and never was prosecuted for. same,
‘except that he left Youngstown for a period of time, Further,
MALLAMO was sentenced to a term in the Mahoning County Jail
during the early 1940's following a State rackéts investigation,
and no record of same is maintained in the Identification
Division of the Youngstown PD. .

This office will remain alert, however, to MALLAMO's
being questioned at any time by local authorities, and if. the
occasion arises, an attempt will be made to locate these photos.

Re: PROSECUTION IN LOCAL MAHONING COUNTY
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, YOUNGSTOWN

admitted to bail pending filing and disposition of a petition
for writ of certiorari, The stay was conditioned upon his
posting of a $5,000 bail bond with the Seventh District Court

Of Appeals of Ohio.

 

; Mahoning County Prosecutor OSBORNE advised that

, tentative arrangements have been made for DAVID COMAN,
