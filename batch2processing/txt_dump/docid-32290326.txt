LV 92-308

On 9/15/67, an effort was made to interview
PHYLLIS MC GUIRE by SA M, B, PARKER and SA JAMES E, DOYLE
at the new MC GUIRE residence, The maid informed that
MC GUIRE had just awaken#*and was not dressed. The maid
was instructed to contact MC GUIRE to see when she would
be available for an interview. The maid returned and
stated MC GUIRE had told her to take the names of the agents
and she would contact the office to set up an interview.
The agents returned directly to the office, and MC GUIRE
telephonically contacted the Las Vegas Office within thirty
minutes, Following a telephone conversation with SA PARKER,
She declined to be interviewed in person and the conversation
was terminated.)

 

LV 241-C-TE is extremely close to DAVIS and
MC GUIRE and has occasions to visit her residence frequently.
Informant has advised that he has never seen subject in i
MC GUIRE'S residence, and in informant's opinion, it is he
extremely doubtful that he would ever come to Las vegas.U.

 

PHYLLIS MC GUIRE is currently playing as a single
at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas. LV 361-PC advised on
9/25/68 that MIKE DAVIS was in town and was residing with |
MC GUIRE at her home. Informant further stated that DAVIS
had bought MC GUIRE a $35,000 custom-made Rolls Royce
automobile which he had delivered to MC GUIRE on that date. (/

Periodic checks are made of MC GUIRE's residence
by the Las Vegas Division. From a check of automobiles,
it appears MC GUIRE is utilizing the services of a maid
named BESSIE MC NEAL, whom MC GUIRE has utilized for a number
of years when she would be appearing in Las Vegas prior to
her moving here. Following MC GUIRE's appearance at the
Desert Inn Hotel with her sisters in 1961, MC NEAL was
interviewed and while she was not belligerent, she was
definitely not cooperative. She gave the impression during
the interview that she was completely loyal to MC GUIRE in
every respect. U
