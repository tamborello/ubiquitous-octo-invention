MEMORANDUM FOR : General Counsel
: Director of Sccurity

FROM : S.D. Breckinridge

SUBJECT 2° HSCA Request of 26 July 1978 -
~ OLC- 78-2728 :

1. Attached is correspondence from the DDO focal
point on the HSCA investigation, responding to Question |
f2 of reference. It states that there ure and have been
ho agreements (at least not as described in the HSCA
request) between CIA and the FBI, or other governaent
agencies, that pertain to the Agency's responsibilities
to report on U.S. citizens abroad who contact Coamunist
embassies or officials. It also states that current
legislation forbids such Teporting.

2. Attached are copics of Papers collected by
O/IG during the Rockefeller Commission's inquiry; 1
recall that there was a 1966 @ereenent, which is not in
these papers. In any event they do not scem to contain
a specific provision such as is envisioned in the report.
It is possible that interpretations of KSCID and DCID
provisions resulted in routine reporting of such con-
tacts, although there were no agreenents, per se, for
such action. Since the proaulgation of Executive
Orders 11905 and 12036 there have been limitations on
reporting on U.S. persons, which may affect past practice.
However, this office is not in a position to provide an

Agency position on this issue. N

3. It is requested that you coordinate with the
DDO in preparing an answer to an Agency response to

the HSCA question. . ‘
