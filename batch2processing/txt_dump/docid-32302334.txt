TT OTHEAHI

On July 13, 1966, a confidential informant advised that ;
about two weeks ago an individual known as EvilieXEstrella, a
Cuban, whom the informant described as possibly coming originally
from the Cuban Province of Pinar del Rio, appeared at the Pan
American Union (PAU) in Washington, DsCi Estrella went to the ake
office of another Cuban, Guillermo/Belt, who never met Estrella
and asked if Belt could get Secretary of PAU to type a smallj
page memorandum for him. MK) U ;

    

    
  
     
  
   
    
 
 

The informant learned [from Belt, who is employed in th

Department of Administrative Affairs of the PAU,] that the memora

dum which was handwritten in the Spanish language and centained
many spelling and grammatical errors, was of no real substance,
It merely recognized the need for unification among Cubans and the
establishment of a Cuban Government In Exile. The memorandum then
set out a long list of names of various Cubans who were to partici-~j;.-
pate in the exile government. The informant recalled the following

President - Carlos#iarquez#Sterling, former Cuban
Presidential Aspirant in 1958
. weSicential Aspirant in 1958"

United Nations Representative - EniloxNunez*Portuondo,
former Cuban Senator and United Nations

The informant also learned [from Belt at the PAU that ¢ Yu)
the memorandum was originally to be taken by Estrella tomthe

White House and presented to the President of the United States, —
However, after the memorandum was typed and in good form, Estrella
decided to take it to the United States Department of State (USDS)

ek,

[Beit told the informant]Estrella appeared naive _cancern-
| ing this wWatter because Estrella gave the impression that the

ha second confidential informant advised on July 13, 1966!
that he has been avery close friend of Carlos Marquez Sterling ~
for many years. He recently received a letter from Sterling
which did not mention one word of the scheme of Estrella and

| the fact that Estrella "appointed" Sterling as head of the Cuban
Government in Exile. The informant felt that had this been an
endeavor initiated with the consent of Sterling he, the informant,
would have learned of it before now. %) u :

Both informants considered this\just another attempt by
another Cuban exile to establish a government in exile; placed
no importance on the matter and could furnish no additional
information concerning it, (A) U

na Belt's position was ve ified through the "Telephone
Directory" published by the PAU March, 1966, u
