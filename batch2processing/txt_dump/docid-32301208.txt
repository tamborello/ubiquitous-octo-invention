became clear that they did not intend to leave, it was decided
that the risk of discovery was too great, and the mission was
called off.

On 2/21/62 in the afternoon, SA THOMAS G,. FORSYTH III received
a telephone call from New Kensington Police Chief DAN JOSEPHS,
who asked if the Pittsburgh Office had been working in New
Kensington that morning. Chief JOSEPHS was asked why he had
made that. inquiry, and he said his early morning shift Desk
Sergeant told him that LOUIS CIANCUTTI had reported that four
men in a car had been "hanging around" CIANCUTTI's house in a
suspicious manner. CIANCUTTI had a license number and asked
to have it checked. Since the license number was not found in
the license registration books furnished to.the Police Depart-
ment by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Motor Vehicles, the Desk
Sergeant assumed the car was a "secret" registration to Some
law enforcement agency, probably Federal. When asked who the
Desk Sergeant was, Chief JOSEPHS replied, "“RODITIS."

On 2/23/62 PG 612-Cwas asked by SA THOMAS G, FORSYTH III . OTHER 4
whether the "heat" was still on in New Kensington, and informant

replied that SA FORSYTH should know the answer without asking

“since everyone in town knew the "Feds" were in New Kensington

almost every night. :

on 2/27/62 PCI [sd was asked the same question and
his reply was practically the same. PCI said he felt that

ie ; "Government Agents" were still trying to contact individuals

yy who would testify before the current FGJ against the MANNARINOs.

a: He said he had heard rumors that "the boys" might be following
the "Government Agents" in an attempt to ascertain the identi-
ties of individuals they contacted. .

On 3/2/62 SA FRANCIS LARKIN, Intelligence Division, IRS,
Pittsburgh, advised SA FORSYTH that he and others from his

| office make frequent evening trips to New Kensington. and
environs in order to interview prospective FGJ witnesses and
to conduct surveillances in connection with some of their

' investigations.

When they were contacted, as set out above, both PG 612-C and OTHER 4
PCL —— said they have noted that GABRIEL MANNARINO spends
considerably less time in New Kensington than was formerly

the case, due to the "continuing Heat" by the Federal Govern-

ment. They said that MANNARINO still visits the back room of

the Supper Club of America in New_Kensington but on an infre-

quent and irregular basis. Pcl [CC Jestimated MANNARINOs

visits to occur about once each week for anywhere from a half

an hour to an hour, but he could not say if any one day was

more likely than any other.

Due to the physical problems involved, the Pittsburgh Office

cannot be absolutely certain of security if an attempt should

be made for a misur installation at the Supper Club of America.

The site is a street-level storefront which can be entered

only through its one-door in front. It is located on a very

short side street between two of New Kensington's main thoro-

fares, and the brilliance of the street lights is such as to

illuminate all portions of the entrance. Surveillance has

proven that traffic passes at all hours of the night. The '
lock is of the Shaler type, with mushroom pins, requiring each :
to be picked. Due to the lighted and exposed nature of .the

door, the time required to open the lock would be increasing

the danger of discovery.

Because of the awareness of the racketeering element of

"Pederal heat," of the diminished frequency of MANNARINO'S
visits, and of the lack of security, a misur installation will
not be requested at the Supper Club of America office at this
time. However, the Pittsburgh Office will be alert for improve-
ment in conditions at that location and will continue to attempt
to find another location where a feasible and productive
installation can be made regarding GABRIEL MANNARINO.
