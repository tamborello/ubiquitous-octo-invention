This office was in very close touch with all Mexican
police agencies during the time of the visit of President
KENNEDY to Mexico, 6/29-7/1/62. To our knowledge only one
american was arrested by Mexican authorities during the course
of this visit. This individual, DAVID JOSEPH ST. JACQUES,’ AEA,
FBI #3418788, was arrested on 6/29/62 when he endeavored to
approach the Presidential automobile in which President KENNEDY |
was viding down Reforma Street in Mexico City. It subsequently
-developed that ST.’ JACQUES was a psychopathic case who fancied

that all the cancer cases in the United States were being caused
__by the noxious fumes being released by chemical factories and
: Fe wanted to talk to President KENNEDY about this matter.
