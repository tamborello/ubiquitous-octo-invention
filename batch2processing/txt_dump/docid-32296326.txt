‘Careful consideration has been given to the use of
T symbols in this report and they have been used only in those
instances where it is necessary to conceal the source.

Detroit Informants DE 370-C, DE 878-C-TE, DE 889-C-TE,
and DE 906-C* have furnished considerable information in the
past which cumulatively reflects good over-all coverage of
the Detroit "Family", but every effort is being made to develop
new sources which can authoritatively define the organization
in the light of current organizational changes. It is to be
noted that the local organization appears to be undergoing a
change, with JOSEPH ZERILLI, reported "Commission" member and
the "elder statesman” becoming more inactive while the second
generation leadership is apparently beginning to take over.

It has not been authoritatively determined whethéx the organization
of the Detroit "Syndicate", including non-Italians, coincides
in all respects with the organization of "Causa Nostra",
