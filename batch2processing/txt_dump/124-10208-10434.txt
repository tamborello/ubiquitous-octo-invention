MANUEL EDUARDO CABALLERO, confidential contact and
Costa Rican revolutionary who participated in the CASTILLO ARMAS
overthrow of the ARBENZ regime, has advised that information
available to him fails to indicate that BROWDER actually partici-
pated in the CASTILLO ARMAS revolution as he claims. CABALLERO
-cc is presently in Guatemala City, however, in the company of former
az.c2 Costa Rican President RAFAEL CALDERON GUARDIA and, since they
expect to be in contact with Guatemalan President CASTILLO ARMAS
and other high officials of his administration, CABALLERO has
stated they will make inquiry concerning the subject in an effort
to determine whether or not he is in Guatemala and whether or not

he furnished arms for and/or participated in the Guatemalan
revolution.
