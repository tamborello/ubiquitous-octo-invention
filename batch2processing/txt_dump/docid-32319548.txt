New Orleans indices do not contain any information
of value on ROBERT LECORGNE.

For the Bureau's information, the Louisiana

. Judiciary Commission was newly established in 1968 as a
part of the Louisiana Constitution, Article 9,Section 4,
which provides for the make-up of the commission “to con-
sist of one Judge of the Court of Appeals, three judges of
courts of record selected by the Supreme Court, two members
of the Louisiana Bar Association, who have practiced in
Louisiana, for ten years, and one citizen, and provides
that the Judicial Administrator is the chief executive of
the Judicial Commission. The Judicial Commission's pro-
ceedings are confidenfial and their job is to investigate
and hold hearings to remove any judge guilty of wilful
misconduct relating to his official duties, habitual —
intemperance or conviction while in office of a felony.

‘New Orleans indices contain numerous references
in which the opinions of Judge HAGGERTY are noted throughout
the trial of CLAY SHAW for conspiracy in the death of
President KENNEDY.

The first confidential source is NO 1697- PC,
NO file 92-564 and 137-3484, Bufile 92-7779.

The second confidential source is NO 1203- Cc,
