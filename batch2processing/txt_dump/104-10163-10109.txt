REFS: A.UFCA 16973, 24 July 1964
B.UFGS 1018, 6 Feb. 1962

1. Chief, KUSODA, has advised, in response to ysur query contained
in Reference A, that “at this late date Subject has no recourse to over-
turn ODACID's ruling that he lost his PBPRIME citizenship by his accept-
ing employment in the PBRUMEN Government. Tr protect the PBPRIME
citizenship of an individual who engages in activities which would’.
normally expatriate himself requires prior agreement between KUBARK and
ODACID. This was not done in Subject's case. Then, too, Subject, by
his application for and acceptance of 2» inmigration visa to enter
PBPRIME as a permanent resident alien ia in effect an admission a by hia
of loss of his previous PBPRIME citizenship".

2. The above opinion reiterates that expressed in a previous revi
of this case, see reference BS, which was the basis for Subject's applyt

for his immigration visa.

3. While we regret any past aisunderstandings on the part of
Subject and, in particular, any aisinterpretations which may have been
presented to him by his various KUBARK contacts, we ask that JMNJAVE
iafore Subject that KUBARK cannot now intercede on his behalf for .
restoration cf citizenship. . t
