1962 stated that CoS would have the full details of the
capital outlay required by 23 June; however, the informat

une

ion

has not been received as of 3 Juty, The last cable to the

Station, DIR 18391 told COS to contact you directly on his
arrival on 16 July. ,

2. With regard to candidates spotted by QUWIN, the
two whom he spotted in Italy a year and @ quarter ago can
probably be used if needed, if we can accept the assessme
of them by the Trieste Base contract agent, Magonetti,
Magonetti’s assessment is contained in OTRA227522 dated
10 Way 1961. The names of the two French candidates are
tained in OLLA.1226 dated '5 December 1961. No action ha
been taken on’these names regarding tracing or anything ‘c¢
My handwritten notes attached to that dispatch contain
