A review of the Chicago files and investigation
by the Chicago Division has failed to reflect any information
that individuals identified as members or former members
of Minutemen are purchasing arms and amunition for use
in carrying out the stated objectives of the organization,
thereby posing a threat to the life of the President and
other public officials,

There is no indication from information obtained
by the Chicago Division that the activities of Minutemen
and/or “itss members are in violation of any Federal statutes

“over: which the Bureau has investigative jurisdiction.

Consideration has been given to every source
concesled and "T' symbols were utilized only in those
instances where. the identity of the sources must be concealed.

On July 9, 1964, BERNARDO B. SPEISER was interviewed
and furnished names and addresses of individuals who were
mailed Minutemen literature in envelopes with aréturn address
of Animal Drug Products Company, Inc., 4122 West Grand Avenue,
Chicago, illinois. The names and addresses contained on
these envelones were previously furnished to the Bureau
and other interested Offices by Chicago airtel to the Bureau,
dated July 22, 1964, and are not set forth in this report.
