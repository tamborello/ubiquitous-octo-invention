on NOVEL which appeared in the MIAMI HERALD-on 26 April.

Carlos QUIROGA (Paragraph 7(C) of reference memorandum)

Subject is possibly identifiable with, Carlos QUIROGA,
a former student at Lousiana State University who was a :
candidate for the Agency Student Recruitment Program, This
involved recruitment of Cuban students in the US who would
return to Cuba as agents in place. JMWAVE traces reflect
an individual of the same name was an electrical engineer,

'vesiding at 3134 Derby Place, New Orleans, in December 1964.

Subject reportedly had homosexual tendencies, low morals,
and until the middle of 1961 was an ardent CASTRO supporter
and made anti-US statements. There is no indication that a»
Carlos QUIROGA was. ever employed by the Agency in any
capacity. Se ,

Emilio SANTANA (paragraph 7 C of reference memorandum) |

DPOB: 7 Sept 1935, Cardenas, Matanzas, Cuba
(also reported 7 Sept 1936 and 7 Sept 1937

   
    
    
 
 
   
  

1. Subject is probably identifiable. With Emilio SANTANA
Galindo, who was recruited by JMWAVE in December 1960 as a
guide for an infiltration team. SANTANA was paid a monthly
salary under provisions of his MOC until. he was terminated
on 15 October 1963 when the ratline developed by the tean
became inoperable due to occupation of the target. area by
Soviet technicians. Another compelling reason for SANTANA's
termination stemmed from his untrithful reporting concerning
certain aspects of the team operations, '

2. Inan attempt to establish positive identification,
JMWAVE obtained a report from the Dade County (Miami)
Sheriff's office that an Enhilio SANTANA (no matronymic) 4
born 6 July 1936 in Cuba, was declared a fugitive from
Louisiana on-a. federal warrant 22 December 1965, FBI Sheet
132287F, based on two counts of burglery in Louisiana.

He was arrested and booked by the Dade County Sheriff's
office on 2 February 1966 and was presumably sent back to
Louisiana, At the time of his arrest SANTANA gave his
address as 851 SW 4th Street, Miami, which is the same
address shown on an old immigration firm when he was

living in Miami, Headquarters files indicate SANTANA is
separated from his wife who apparently still resides at

the old Miami address. Since SANTANA's date of birth varies j
on various documents in his 201 file, the variation in birth j
date on his arrest sheet is not conclusive. The fact he .
did give his former address to the arresting officers :
indicates he is Emilio SANTANA Galindo, A 1962 immigration

JMWAVE for identification purposes if this becomes necessary.

3. Although JMWAVE has had no contact with SANTANA
since his termination, there is a note in Station files
dated 23 June 1964 that SANTANA used the Agency as his
employer on an aug credit application,

Edward §8. BUTLER (Paragraph 7 (A) of reference memorandum)

. > .

.
In January 1965 Subject's organization (INCA), sponsored

the New Orleans appearance of Juanita CASTRO shortly after
her arrival in the US. INCA had a particular interest in
Miss CASTRO since they distributed hundreds of tapes contan-
ing Miss CASTRO's declarations when she was surfaced in
Mexico. A JMWAVE asset, who is Miss CASTRO's business manager,
handled the planning and arrangements for the New Orleans
visit with INCA officials, The only subsequent contact
between the JMWAVE asset and Edward BUTLER occurred when
BUTLER was recently in Miami promoting the INCA film on ‘
"CASTRO-HITLER in HAVANA", See Attachment 2 for a summary
of the INCA organization. : ,

Albert FOWLER (Paragraph 7(B) of reference memorandum)
DPOB: 15.July 1929, New Orleans, Louisiana

1. Subject is Alberto Casimir FOWLER Perillait, a
member of Brigade 2506 who was captured duting the invasion
and returned to the US in the December 1962 prisoner —
exchange. . ~

2. FOWLER apparently returned to Cuba with his parents
during his early life and returned to the US to attend .
scha@ll in his late teens. He attended the. Lenox School,
Lenox, Massachusetts, 1948-49; Louisiana State University

 1949- 51. After his graduation from LSU he returned to Cuba
and married Margarita Paulette Van der SCHUEREN, born 13 ‘
“ August 1933, Brussels, Belgum, FOWLER was President of

the North American Sugar Company , Havana, from 1951 until
he returned to the US in November’ 1960 and enlisted in
Brigade 2506. At the time of his enlistment he gave Mark
FOSTER, Cuban Refugee Center White House Representative,
and former US Ambassador William D, PAULEY, as references.
Following his release from prison FOWLER worked for the
BRAHMS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, Palm Beach, Florida, where his
father resides, and for BROOKS TRAVEL SERVICES, W. Palm
Beach, Florida, until at least late 1964, He apparently
lost his US citizenship during his years of residence in
Cuba and immigration records indicate he applied for advance
_ parole status in November 1964 while he was still. employed
in W. Palm Beach. He apparently returned to Louisiana
sometime after that date. FOWLER’s mother lives in Coving~
ton, Louisiana, and he has a sister who is married to Fort
PIPES, Jr., member of a prominent New Orleans family.

Sergio Vicente ARCACHA Smith (Enclosure 2 of reference .memorandum)

DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba

1. Traces on ARCACHA do not reflect the date he first
arrived in the U.S. However, he became the FRENTE REVOLU-
CIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (FRD) delegate in New Orleans prior —
to the Bay of Pigs invasion and continued in that position
until the FRD ceased to function. The FRD was the predecessor
of the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organized and
supported by the Agency. The organization was used as a ‘
front for recruitment of Brigade 2506 for the invasion.
During this period ARCACHA reported to the FRD headquarters
in Miami through a post office box in Coral Gables, and
reportedly maintained extensive relations with the New
Orleans FBI and Immigration offices. Two of his regular
FBI contacts were a Mr. De Bruce and the deceased Guy
Banister. ‘ ;

. 2, ARCACHA was also one of the promoters of the
FRIENDS OF DEMOCRATIC CUBA, INC (FDC) which was incorporated
in New Orleans on G January 1961, This organization was
ostensibly created by several New Orleans business and
political figures, including the deceased former FBI agent,

‘Guy Banister, to collect money to aid Cubans in their

fight against Communism. According to the articles of
incorporation, these donations would also be used to support
the FRD and the funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,
less a percentage to be retained by the FDC. An investi-- F
gation conducted by a reliable Miami, Station asSet concluded

' that the FDC was organized strictly for the personal gain

of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of
ARCACHA. The investigation produced no evidence that any
individual donations were ever solicited or received and
recommended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the
books of the.New,@rleans Exporters Company be investigated
for evidence of rsonal gain and possible evidence of
federal tax evasion, since both the president of the New
Orleans Exporters Company, Gerard F. Tunague, and the Chief
of New Orleans Stevedores Union, Alfred Chittenden, were
officials of the FDC, Approximately one month after the
FpC was created, strong criticism from some prominent Cubans
put the organization out of business. ;

.3. Information in an immigration card reflects that
ARCACHA travelled to Caracas, Venezuela at an unspecified
date. His address in Venezuela was HOTEL TIUNA, Caracas,
and his US address was listed as 4523 Duplesses Street,
New Orleans. Passport No. 00433.
