beat Pittsburgh letter dated 12-28-55, requested Bureau authority to

make a survey to determine the feasibility of establishing a MISUR at a
cottage owned by subject. On 12-31-59, the Bureau granted authority and
_ _ the results of the survey were recorded in Pittsburgh letter dated 1-25-60.
p The survey -reflected that the only feasible means of establishing MISUR
coverage at that time was to use radio-microphone techniques. By letter
‘dated 2-1-60, the Bureau observed that a radio-microphone might be
_... feagible in this instance, but pointed out that such equipment as was then
{°~\. available to the Laboratory had a relatively short life and would not be
or ‘.guitabie in an installation where long life was required. In subsequent
ae correspondence, possible alternative means of obtaining coverage were
: -» eongidered and ruled out because of technical and physical limitations. .

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
      
 

in-view of the above, Pittsburgh will be interested to know that,
subsequent to the above communications, the Laboratory has developed
and constructed a completely transistorized battery (or AC) powered |
miniature transmitter (known as the MUTT transmitter) together with
. appropriate receiving equipment. This equipment is now ready for field
“use. It is relatively immune to the weaknesses of older equipment (as
described-if Bulet dated 2-1-60) and, therefore, is suitable for use in a
rajio<microphone installation such as originally proposed by Pittsburgh.

 

The transmission system consists of one or more variable
yeluctance microphones (approximately 7/32" by 12/32" by 19/32") and a
MUTT transmitter (approximately 9/16" by 1 13/16" by 31/4").. The
fransmitter can be powered by one or more small batteries or by means

bf a transistorized 117 volt AC power supply (approximately 11/16" by
: 1/2" by 31/2"), The receiving equipment consists of either a highly
portable battery powered receiver or a slightly less portable 117 volt AC) J
powered réceiver. The,range of the MUTT transmitter varies with
