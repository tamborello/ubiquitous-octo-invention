the hope that subject had a good time with "IRISH" and SYBIL
and the COYS. HUBERMAN stated, "We'll follow your directions"
on whom to include in trial subscriptions. HUBERMAN indi-
cated that the subject in his-previous letter had inquired
if it would be possible to expand "M. R." readership best
among younger elements on a trial subscription basis.
HUBERMAN stated that it certainly was possible and that it
is probably the best promotion plan. He thanked the subject
again for the subject's help in that cirection.( $f] uJ

ordered that a number of Americans in Mexico be brought into
closer contact with the Branch. A number of ideas for such

a meeting were discussed at a Branch meeting and had been
vetoed by her. According to MORA, the first suggestion had
been to bring selected Americans, including the subject and
his wife, to a meeting of the Leadership Branch. MORA had
taken the position that those individuals would not go to
such a meeting. A Communist "cause" party had been suggested
which would also serve as a means of obtaining 20 pesos
($1.60 U.S.) from each of the individuals attending. MORA
stated that the Americans mentioned, including the subject and
his wife, would not’ go to such 4a party either, but would
merely pay their 20 pesos and not attend| Y ih)

 

According to MORA, the decision was finaly reached
to invite the Americans to a "posado party" on 11/2/63 to ;
. Bive the Americans a chance to look the Mexicans over and vice
versa. Plans for such a party were made, but it subsequently
became necessary, according to the informants, to postpone it
because of the absence of one of the members of the Leadership
Branch and because of unsettled political conditions. in Nu)
