Sad

103882 dated 21 January 1971) exchanged between Colonel
Wimert and General Bennett on the events in Chile during
the latter part of 1970.

@ Also attached is a covering note to General Bennett
from William Broe, then Chief: of the CIA Western Hemi-
sphere Division. This covering note also contains an
original handwritten acknowledgment from General Philpott

to Mr. Broe.

 

While these messages vere! exchanged more than two
months after the event, they are possibly of current interest
because they. concern the General Schneider incident.
