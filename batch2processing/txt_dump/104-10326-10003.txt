“[D/OPS-

MCLAUGHLIN EXPLAINED, "WE ARE CREATING OPS FOR SEVERAL REASONS:

SENSIND:

  
    
 

    

 

--FITRST, WE NEED TO PAY INCREASED ATTENTION TO HOW THE DI SUPPORTS A
RANGE OF KEY CUSTOMERS. IMPROVING SUPPORT TO THE POLICYMAKER AND THE
MILITARY IS A CRITICAL AREA OF INVESTMENT FOR THE DIRECTORATE'S
FUTURE, AND CREATION OF OPS REPRESENTS A STEP IN THIS DIRECTION. BOTH
THE OPS CENTER AND PASS, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKING MAJOR
EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THEIR DELIVERY OF DI PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND
THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM INCREASED DAY-TO-DAY ATTENTION OF AN OFFICE
DEDICATED TO HELPING THEM REACH THOSE GOALS. SIMILARLY, WE ARE
EXPECTING THE NEW OFFICE TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT SETTING FOR PES--WHICH
£S TO HELP US EVALUATE HOW WE SERVE THE CONSUMER--TO GET ON ITS FEET
RAPIDLY.

 

--OPS WILL ALSO, FOR THE FIRST TIME, PROVIDE A FOCAL POINT FOR
SUPPORTING DI REPS BOTH HERE AND ABROAD. AS THAT EFFORT BECOMES MORE
IMPORTANT BOTH FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND EXPERTISE DEVELOPMENT, WE
INEED TO BRING MUCH GREATER ATTENTION TO ENSURING THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE
EFFECTIVELY DEPLOYED AND THAT THEY GET THE BACKING THEY NEED. RIGHT
NOW, MOST REPS HAVE NO SINGLE PLACE TO GO FOR SUPPORT; OPS WILL
ENSURE THAT THEY DO. MEANWHILE, OPS WILL WORK WITH THE DI’S COUNCIL
OF INTELLIGENCE OCCUPATIONS TO DEVELOP DIRECTORATE POLICIES ON WHERE
REPS WILL BE MOST USEFULLY STATIONED.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

~-FINALLY, THE CURRENT ODDI IS TOO BIG. AT MORE THAN PEOPLE, IT
IS ALMOST AS LARGE AS SOME LINE DI COMPONENTS, TAKING VALUABLE TIME
AWAY FROM ADDI WINSTON WILEY AND ME IN FOCUSING.ON THE NEEDS OF THE
DI AT LARGE. ESTABLISHING OPS WILL MAKE THE REMAINING ODDI MORE
MANAGEABLE, ALLOWING US TO FOCUS MORE INTENTLY ON THE RIGHT RANGE OF
SUBSTANTIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES.

 

 

I WANT TO STRESS, HOWEVER, THAT OPS IS NOT GOING TO TAKE LARGE
AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES FROM THE REST OF THE DIRECTORATE NOR IMPEDE
DIRECT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DDI/ADDI AND KEY OPERATIONS SUCH AS
THE PRESIDENE’S DAILY BRIEF (PDB) ALL OF THE UNITS COMPOSING THE
OFFICE ALREADY EXIST, AND THE NEW FRONT OFFICE WILL CONSIST OF A
DIRECTOR--NO DEPUTY--AND LITERALLY A HANDFUL OF ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL,
4INCLUDING AN<EXECUTIVE>OFFICER (EXO). OTHERWISE, OPS AND THE ODDI
WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE THE SAME SUPPORT STAFF, AND THEY WILL BOTH
[LOOK AT WAYS TO MAKE THEIR OPERATIONS MORE EFFICIENT. IN THIS WAY, BY
MAKING A SMALL INVESTMENT IN A MORE FOCUSED MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE,
WINSTON AND I BELIEVE WE CAN HELP POSITION THE DI TO SERVE THE
CUSTOMER BETTER--WHETHER IT’S THE PDB RECIPIENT, THE DCI AND DDCI,
THE POLICYMAKER RECEIVING CLOSE SUPPORT FROM A DI REP, OR THE WIDE
RANGE OF OTHER OFFICIALS WHO COUNT ON OUR LIAISON AND INFORMATION
RELEASE STAFFS TO HANDLE AN EVER-INCREASING WORKLOAD EFFECTIVELY."

THE CHIEF OF THE CRIME AND NARCOTICS CENTER (CNC) TOLD WHAT’S NEWS,
“a HAVE MADE IT A PRIORITY TO DEVELOP A CLOSER PARTNERSHIP WITH NDIC
AND IN DISCUSSIONS WITH NDIC‘S DIRECTOR, BOTH OF US DECIDED THAT THE
ASSIGNMENT OF A SENIOR CIA OFFICER TO NDIC WOULD BRING US EVEN CLOSER
TOGETHER . IDEN A WAS THE IDEAL CHOICE GIVEN HER SKILLS AND
BACKGROUND AS DEPUTY NIO FOR LATIN AMERICA AND AS AN EXPERIENCED
SENIOR OPERATIONS OFFICER. NDIC IS REFINING ITS MISSION TO INCLUDE
NATIONAL STRATEGIC ASSESSMENTS OF THE DRUG THREAT IN THE US. THE NEW
INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURE REVIEW, STILL IN DRAFT FORM, VALIDATES THiS

ts| THAT WITH THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE DOMESTIC
THREAT, I.E., THOSE KEY FOREIGN DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS
CONTROLLING DRUG TRADE IN THE US, WE WILL BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO
TRACE THE LINKS TO THEIR PARENT ORGANIZATIONS ABROAD, AND BETTER
FOCUS OUR OWN FOREIGN COLLECTION, ANALYTIC, AND OPERATIONAL EFFORTS.
