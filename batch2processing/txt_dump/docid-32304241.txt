3. NYO is ewell aware of the Bureau's position with
regard to polygraph testing and appreciates the Burea
reluctance to rely upon its use in the average case. However,
the subject of this case became affiliated with Cuban G-2 soon
after it was formed in 1959, he was afforded extensive training
and he entered the US under the guise of an escaped refugee
carrying $4,000 given to him by Cuban G-2 to carry out the
assassination of MANOLO RAY,=an anti-Castro leader in Puerto Rico.
Subject has. also.admitted travelling to Mexico City in 1967 and
then receiving from Cuban G-2 the assignment to assassinate
FELIPE RIVERO, another anti-Castro leader. KObviously this is a
very unusual cage with numerous ramificatiéns, and NYO feels _

. Therefore, NYO requests the Bureau to authorize a
polygraph test for subject and asks that the most serious

consideration be given this request. If approved, NYO would
attempt to obtain more favorable circumstances for the
polygraph test. This might result in subject's disc. ure of

Subject was interviewed on 2/5 and 7/69, after
signing rights waiver form on both dates at. the Federal
Correctional Institution, Danbury, Conn., by SAS JOSEPH T.
CORRIGAN and FRANCIS I. LUNDQUIST. Conditions were very
unsatisfactory for interview. The interviewing agents were
afforded the use of three rooms for the interviews, all of which
were utilized. However, all rooms had glass panes on the doors
and, therefore, the subject and interviewing agents were visible
io to passersby. The interviews were disrupted on 30 to 40 occasions-
by different inmates who were curious as to what was happening’
and who peered through the glass panes,apparently in an effort.
to identify the subject whom they probably regarded as a stool
pigeon." Moreover, fragments of the interviews unquestionably
could be heard by inmates standing and loitering outside the
doors of the interview rooms. This made the subject highly .
nervous and interferred with his concentration. Cu)
