concerning the alleged 7 million dollars in go. :
in Puerto Rico. He indicated to SPINDEL that rather than
attempt to steal this gold, SPINDEL should determine its exact

political affiliations in Washington to secure a reward for
SPINDEL and himself for pinpointing this gold for the United
{ _" . States Government. He stated he told SPINDEL this in an L
\ attempt to get SPINDEL to tell where the gold-is so that he may,

1 : in turn, pass this information along to the proper authorities, who
‘ then would be in a position to possibly apprehend SPINDEL at :
the site of the storage place for the gold. He stated that
SPINDEL "bought this story" and is extremely anxious to get the
source to accompany him to Puerto Rico in an attempt to locate

the gold. He told SPINDEL that he would not accompany him

to Puerto Rico unless SPINDEL. had positively identified the

hiding place. ; ; :

heavy work schedule and efforts. are constantly being made to sit
