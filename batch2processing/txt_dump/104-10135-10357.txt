Shep: Re HSCA request 6 July 78 (OLC 78-2491)
_ Para_3: We have no record of any transcripts or recordings of conversations of Sack |
'Whitten/or Win Scott. If any exist should be in CI Staff.

Fara 4: Annie Goodpasture wrote a history of the Mexico Station for the Western Hemi-
sphere Division not the White House. This history covers the period from the inception
of the Station inf _|to 1969. There is very little material dealing with the Kenned
assassination but a great deal of material relating to, i

jand operations..not related to the HSCA investigation, It is impossible to san-
itize this tome and the "soft file" docyments do not exist. There is a bibliography but
again precious little pertains.
