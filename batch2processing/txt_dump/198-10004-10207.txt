BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO
COUNTER SUBVERSION FOR THE
PERIOD 1 NOV ~ 1 DEC 1963.

3. Control of Clandestine Movement of Guerrillas and Armes.

 

a Ona § Nevember 1963 the Commander-in-Ghied, US
Southern Command (USCINCSO) advieed the Joint Chiefs of Staff
(JCS) of reports concerning suspected eubversive arma omuggling
inte Venecuela or Colombia from the Colen Free Zone, Panama.
USCINGSO initiated surveillance at firgt ight on ¢ November 1963
to detect and track aurface veesele which might be engaged in the
subversive traffic. The ICS directed the Commander-in-Chicf,
Atiantic (CINCLANT) to commence surveillance with radar equipped
aizeeaft and to keep USCINCSO advised of all information. Sue-
pected craft were not positively identified or intercepted; however,
there were indications that an unidentified surface veasal off the
Rie Hacha area of Colombia and in Colombian waters wae probably
io contact with small boats operating from the Colorabian coastline
atnight. —

b. An dizected by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, USCINESO
developed 4 plan uader which the United Sietes could provide asgiate
ance te Venenuelan forces, on three levels of participation, designed
to prevent the surreptitious movement of Castro~Communist arma
and perdonnel into Veneauels. To he fully effective, the plan calls
for US elementa operating from Veneauclan territery which ia not
considered a likely aubject for epprovel by the Government of
Venesguala at the present time,

ec. A joint gurvey and mobile training team of eleven men was
provided by USCINCZO to Venezuela on 22 Novernber 1963, upon
appieval of the concept by the Government of Venezuela, The p purpose
of the team ig te train Veneguelan military personnel in organiaing
and operating 4 Joint operations center; in improving capabilities
im the plotting and ceordiastion of intelligence data, and aerial phote-
graphy; and in coordinating all Venesuclan military and paramilitary
organizations involved in surveillance and intercept operations.

MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR, DDR&E
Office of the Secretary of Defense

SUBJECT: Anti-Sabotage Operations in Latin America

The tnterdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban
Affaire (ICCOCA}) haa recently considered to provide

guidance to US firme in Latin America confrented with © =
communist inspired sabotage of their facilities and assets, | pas
contracted for the preparation of a report which will consolidate the
experiences of several US firme in Latin America in combatting
@abotage. After consideration by the ICCOCA this report will be
furnished through our country teams in Latin America to local US
firms to assist them in instituting appropriate anti-sabotage programs.

 

 

I would be most teful i ould prepare a brief report
designed to supplement hich would include enumera-
“tien of general guidelines which might be adopted by US firme in the
Latin American area in eombaiting sabotage. In particular, an
enumeration of known appropriate anti-sabotage devices available. on
the commercial market tegether with the manufacturer's names would
be most helpiul..

 

A member of my staff has discussed this project with Mr.
Pheips of your staff, who has indicated that DDR&E might be of assist-
ance in this matter based on.a recent field trip to Venezuela where
problems peculiar to that area were studied at the request of the US
Ambassador. It is also possible that commercial devices developed
for South Vietnam would have applicability in Latin America, Because
this project is designed for distribution to several Latin American

“countries, it is requested that where possible guidelines be developed
which might have genergl application throughout Latin America, but
with emphasic on key subversive target areas, Present plans autici-
pate finalization of thie project by December 23, 1963.
