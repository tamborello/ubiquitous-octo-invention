3 ’ In the summer of 1976, ROSELLI went to Florida
. to see his sister at which time he was murdered.

It is conjectured by MAX that ROSELLI's murder was
done by the CIA to keep him from testifying before the Senate

Committee.

Present during this interview was Sergeant CARL OLSON,
Seattle Police Department, Seattle, Washington.

Once they arrived in Miami Beach, STURGIS: paid MAX and “r
MARADANO $30,000 a piece. Se ;
\ so

Present during//this payoff was sam! GIANCANA, . who
told MAX to contact pera anany, a pit=bess in the Desert a
Inn in Las Vegas, concerning a "hit" in Havana, Cuba. Madr
Apparently, BRADY had beén working at the Capri ‘Casino ‘
in Havana and was familiar with the area.

In mid June, 1961, contact,was made by MAX with

BRADY utilzing the services of JOHNNYXGEORGE, a gambler NL
in Las Vegas, currently building the Atlantis Hotel in “" 7
Las Vegas. “BRADY indicated to MAX*hé was instructed by
someone whom he did not name that he was supposed to
tell MAX all about Havana and the Hilton Hotel there.

_It was assumed by MAX that he was being instructed so
that he could "hit" FIDEL CASTRO.

After receiving information from BRADY, MAX
returned to Miami Beach where he continued to target practice.
A short while later, MAX learned that GIANCANA had a “run in"
with ROBERT KENNEDY in Las Vegas and the "hit" on CASTRO
was called off. MAX was informed his services were no longer
needed. .

In February or March, 1975, JOHN ROSELLI told
MAX that he and SAM GIANCANA were being investigated by the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concerning the
attempted assassination of CASTRO. ROSELLI said GIANCANA
had agreed to testify, but he, ROSELLI, would not say
anything. This conversation between ROSELLI and MAX took
place in Los Angeles. .

. In July, 1975, GIANCANA was killed with seven
.22 caliber bullets after two Chicago policemen on surveillance
were lured away. GIANCANA was killed in his basement. MAX
felt this was not a "mob" hit because the "mob" does not use
.22 pistols, they do not kill a person at home, and they
do not use automatic weapons because it leaves the shell
casings. Two weeks later, ROSELLI told MAX that he had
checked in Chicago and GIANCANA's murder was not a "mob
hit". ROSELLI told him it was a murder by the CIA to insure
,that GIANCANA would say nothing to the Senate Committee
concerning the involvement of the CIA with the "mob".
ROSELLI further indicated to MAX he felt he would be forced
to testify before the Senate Committee and would probably
be "knocked down" or killed because of it.

instructions to leave the luggage in the cab, walk through
the hotel, and get in another cab out the back door of the
hotel. This they did, and then were driven to a home outside
Santo Domingo where they were introduced to WILLIAMS, another
CIA man described as a white male, 6'2", 210 pounds. The
home where they were taken had the appearance of an armed
camp. WILLIAMS gave them maps of the Dominican Republic

and Santo Domingo and told them to study them. These maps
were written both in Spanish and in English with a number

of them having a Library of Congress stamp on them, and
others indicating in Spanish that they were military maps.
MAX still has these maps and they are available if wanted.

WILLIAMS. indicated it would be very hard to "hit"
TRUJILLO inasmuch as TRUJILLO changed routes daily, going
back and forth from his office to the palace and was protected
by sharp shooters.

On the night of May 29, 1961, WILLIAMS indicated
TRUJILLO was going to see his mistress in San Cristopal,
during the evening of May 30, 1961. He was going via the
Coast Highway and would be in a white Chevrolet preceded
by a jeep. In order to fool people, another white Chevrolet
and jeep would follow him some 10 to 15 miles.

In the afternoon of May 30, 1961, MAX, MARADANO,
WILLIAMS, and unknown others of Spanish descent, went in
two jeeps to find a place to "hit" TRUJILLO. A suitable
place was found near a port city, which could be located
on the map if necessary.

- Around midnight on May 30, the jeep and the white
Chevrolet with TRUJILLO appeared. Six men in the first
jeep "took out" TRUJILLO's jeep, disabling the radio and
tires. MAX, the driver, WILLIAMS, and MARADANO, pulled up
next to TRUJILLO in the white Chevrolet and MAX and MARADANO
killed him, using Thompson Submachine Guns. These machine
guns had two clips of shells in each. .

Approximately 6 hours later, after doubling back,
they returned to Santo Domingo and departed four days later,
arriving in Miami Beach via Mexico City, Port au Prince,
Haiti, in the Bahamas, all traveling by commercial airlines.

In April, 1961, an individual known only as MAX
was contacted by a person known only as PHIL "THE STICK"

in New York City. MAX was a "hit man" and was instructed
by PHIL "THE STICK" to go to Florida where he would be

paid $1,000 a week. MAX went to the Carousel Hotel in
Miami Beach and met with SAM GIANCANA. GIANCANA told him
he was going to meet an individual not part of the "mob"
and then introduced him to STURGIS, a CIA Agent described
as a white male, 5'11", and well built. STURGIS questioned
him about his, MAX's, proficiency in weapons and indicated
MAX. should practice on targets in the Okeefenokee Swamps.
These target practices, which were held daily, were in
conjunction with four unknown individuals who came from
other parts of the country. MAX had no idea of their names
or their identities. In their first target practice in the
swamps, STURGIS gave MAX a .38 caliber revolver and asked
him to fire at a target approximately 30 feet away. MAX ©
shot and STURGIS appeared to be satisfied. STURGIS then
gave MAX an Ml Carbine which MAX fired and STURGIS was
again satisfied. STURGIS then instructed MAX in the use

of Thompson Submachine Guns inasmuch as MAX: was not familiar
with them. . . -

Around May 18, 1961, MAX met with GIANCANA, JOHN
ROSELLI, and STURGIS, who told him, MAX, among others, was
to "hit" the dictator of the Dominican Republic, RAFAEL
TRUJILLO. MAX was introduced tO ANGELO“MARADANO phonetic)

play the part of MAX's father with MAX being a mute, thus
hiding the fact that MAX could’ not speak Spanish. The
cover story for these two individuals was that MARADANO
