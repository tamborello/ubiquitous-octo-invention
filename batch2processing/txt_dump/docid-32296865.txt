ADMINISTRATIVE:

The spot physical surveillances of DINO CELLINI
have been conducted by SAs ROBERT A, COOK and FRANK J.
SMITH.

The Cleveland Office, 8/26/68, advised that Cleve-
land telephone number 752-0534 is subscribed to by Mrs.
JOYCE CAMPBELL, aka Mrs. EDDIE CAMPBELL, 3574 East 147th
Street, Cleveland, Ohio.

Mrs. CAMPBELL was interviewed by SAs JOHN J. JUREY
and JOHN DAVIS ROBERSON. She advised that she has resided
at this address, and has subscribed to this telephone for

“several years. She is not acquainted with DINO CELLINI, and
has no contact with anyone in Florida. In view of this, it
appears that there may have been an error on the part of
the Telephone Company in reporting the toll charge.

 

The Cleveland Office, 10/31/68, advised that efforts
to locate and interview MICHAEL JULIAN, who has- been identi-
fied as a contact of DINO CELLINI, have been negative. A
lead has been set out by the Cleveland Office to Youngstown, |
Ohio, to interview JULIAN.
