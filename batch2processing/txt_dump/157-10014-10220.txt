(Jack Anderson)

1. Reference is made to a request from The Honorable
Howard H. Baker, Jr., United States Senate, (Review Staff
75-3115) for clarification regarding a missing copy of a black
briefing notebook concerning the surveillance of Mr. Jack
Anderson. Reference is further made to a previous memorandum
from the Director of Security (OS 5 8665) dated 2 October 1975,
which responded to several questions posed by Senator Baker '
concerning Mr. Jack Anderson.,

2. The black briefing folders referred to by Senator Baker '
were prepared shortly before the Office of Security initiated |
surveillance coverage of Mr. Anderson and his associates. At
the time of their original preparation, a.total of six (6) black
briefing notebooks were created. These six black briefing note-
books were labeled as follows: Headquarters one of three;
Headquarters two of three; Headquarters three of three; Wash- ;
ington Field Office one of three; Washington Field Office two Be
of three; and Washington Field Office three of three. The three —
Headquarters copies were maintained in Headquarters while the :
three field office copies were retained by the Office of Security's i
Washington Field Office. | ; ;

|

3. The six briefing notebooks were created for the sole }
purpose of maintaining a ready reference by both Headquarters |
‘and the Washington Field Office from which to brief those Agency H
employees involved regarding the background and status of the.
Jack Anderson case. It is extremely important to note that the
six briefing folders were intended to remain as exact: duplicates
of one another; and when created they were duplicates. As the
