In addition it is hoped that after completion of a summary report
we can better concentrate on those aspects of the BOSCO operation
which offer the best chance of obtaining evidence and witnesses
for a Grand Jury.

“DL 92-331

.. '

In the Summer of 1965 CIVELLO contacted BOSCO
and said he desired to buy "in" and perhaps there would
come a time when BOSCO could use some help from CIVELLO's
"friends'up East", Because of their long friendship and
BOSCO's desire to expand his bookmaking operation (which
would require more money) and his further desire to be a
closer "friend" of CIVELLO's, BOSCO agreed to let CIVELLO
and IANNI have interest in the bookmaking operation, BOSCO
then told the informant, "I'm not one of JOE's family yet
but I think I will be someday and so will you and NICK."
BOSCO was referring to NICK MORALE, BOSCO then told the
informant, "We all will make more money this way and won't
have to put up with people like NORVELLE or CLARENCE - just
our own kind.” :

. Informant further advised that BOSCO did not
mention anything further about CIVELLO‘s efforts to expand
La Cosa Nostra (LCN) activity and membership in the Dallas
-area ‘and gathered from this that approval had not been
received by CIVELLO "from up East".

 

On June 17, 1966, DL T-2 furnished the following
information: . . - .

During the past two weeks informant has taken
MORALE out to dinner on two occasions and has taken him
to some private clubs for some "social drinking" on three
or four other occasions under the pretext that informant
was trying to interest MORALE in the purchase of insurance
policies from the informant.

On June 16, 1966, while drinking at a private club,
informant: complained to MORALE that BOSCO would only take big
bets and therefore informant was not in a position to bet on
baseball or football like he desired. (BOSCO previously
told the informant he would not handle anything but large
bets.)

MORALE then told the informant that anytime the
informant wanted to bet any amount, big or small, or
anything, he should contact MORALE who would get it down
for the informant with BOSCO, This discussion turned to
the general discussion of gambling in Dallas, to which
MORALE advised the informant that BOSCO and NORVELLE
‘STANFIELD practically controlled all football betting
during the Fall of 1965, MORALE said BOSCO will handle
any sort of bet now on baseball or horse races but that
business. is very slow.

 

MORALE noted that BOSCO and STANFIELD appear to
be having some arguments recently as MORALE heard BOSCO
tell STANFIELD that if he was going to continue to put up

-all the money and make all the arrangements for the apart-
ments and the telephones through his friends, he wanted at
least two-thirds of the profit instead of only 50%. MORALE
stated it appeared that BOSCO was trying to get rid of
STANFIELD before the Fall of 1966.

; Informant asked MORALE where BOSCO got all -the
money for his bookmaking operation and MORALE said that two
of BOSCO's friends, JOE CIVELLO and JOE IANNI, had evidently
bought an interest in BOSCO,”s book and had helped put up the
money. MORALE told the informant that it appears these
three men want to take over all bookmaking in Dallas and
BOSCO once told MORALE that if it were needed, CIVELLO

could get some money from some of his fetends "up East".

. MORALE then told the informant he would do anything
for BOSCO as BOSCO had given him a job after MORALE went
bankrupt running a liquor store. He stated BOSCO has always
taken good care of him and recently told him that if he
(MORALE) kept his nose clean and did what he was told, "We'll
make sure you have got no worries."

MORALE then told the informant he was sure that
BOSCO, CIVELLO and IANNI along with BOSCO'’s good friend,
SAM LOMONACO, were trying to set up an Italian organization
in Dallas, MORALE identified LOMONACO as BOSCO's friend
who furnishes apartments and obtains telephone service for
the bookmaking operation, BOSCO has described LOMONACO as
an old and trusted "friend".

-On May 28, 1966, PHILIP STEPHENS BOSCO contacted
the informant on a social basis. During the conversation
;anformant steered the conversation to the subject of JOE
quai and the Italian element in Dallas. Informant told
BOSCO he recalled when the Italians in Dallas had to clear
any activity through the PIRANIO brothers (CARLO and JOE),
Informant stated he also heard that following their deaths,
CIVELLO attempted to succeed them,

BOSCO then told the following to the informant,
stating he had been furnished this information by JOE
CIVELLO:

. During the 1920's, a "group" of Italians was
organized in Dallas. The "boss" was CARLO PIRANIO and the
No. 1 man “under" CARLO was his brother, JOSEPH, who took
over when CARLO died in about 1930. (The above "words in
quotation are those as used’ by BOSCO.) Members of this
group, according to CIVELLO, were himself, ROSS MUSSO,
FRANK IANNI, RALPH PATRONO, JOE's father PHILIP, CARLOS ‘
CAMPISI, PETE DUCA and ROSS INTERRANTE , ~

This group engaged in some narcotics, gambling
and fencing but they never were’ involved on a very large
scale as all of the rackets in Dallas were then controlled
by a group of non-Italians, Through the PIRANIOS the group
had connections with an Italian group in the Houston - .
Galveston, Texas, area but CARLO and JOE PIRANIO were the
bosses for both of these groups. CIVELLO had bragged to
BOSCO that under the PIRANIOS the group was small but well
organized and through the PIRANIOS the group also had
connections "up East" (meaning New York City) and CIVELLO
had identified one.of these as ROCCO PELLEGRINO,

; In the late 1930's, CIVELLO went to the Federal
Penitentiary and according to BOSCO, CIVELLO has claimed
this was the beginning of a downfall of the Dallas group,
as he and PETER DUCA were the ones who held the Dallas
group together,

Gambling and prostitution were extremely lucrative
rackets in Dallas during the 1940’s but were entirely under
the control of non-Italian hoodlums, The Italian group at
that time was not strong. enough, nor big enough, to take
over in Dallas and CIVELLO had noted that even an organi-
zation from Chicago was unsuccessful when it tried to move
in and take over in Dallas.

CIVELLO has requested BOSCO to slowly, but
surely, get rid of all non-Italians from the bookmaking
operation, CIVELLO told BOSCO that if he gets a chance ae
to increase the group in Dallas he would attempt to propose FLAS

MONACO ,
: LOMONACO is a close personal friend of BOSCO's
and CIVELLO's and has assisted BOSCO in bookmaking operations’
in the past. CIVELLO told BOSCO he could not use IANNI
because of his bad heart and could not use JOE CAMPISI
because of his "big mouth", CIVELLO also stated he did’
not like to have any dealings with PETE INTERRANTE because
PETE was "too hot headed",

BOSCO told the “informant he would keep him advised
of CIVELLO's progress as he knew it would be of interest to
the informant who had expressed a desire to. BOSCO to become
actively engaged in any operation with which JOE CIVELLO
was connected,

On June 20, 1966, DL T-1 furnished the following
information which he ’ obtained on June 16, 1966, from BOSCO:

BOSCO advised informant that baseball booking was
now practically non-existent and that BOSCO and his associates,
JOE CIVELLO and JOE IANNI,were anxiously awaiting the football.
season.

Informant in referring to his previous contact

with BOSCO asked BOSCO how it was that CIVELLO would become
~ such a close associate with BOSCO and IANNI if they were not
already members of CIVELLO's group. BOSCO told informant he
‘had never said that IANNI was or was not a real close "friend"
of CIVELLO's but that CIVELLO could not use him because of his
heart condition, (Informant further noted that BOSCO was
using the term "friend" instead of member.)

BOSCO advised the informant that during the past VE WAS
two years he had had the only money-making bookmaking operation
in the Dallas;area and had been operating it in partnership
