telephone number (614) 922-3521, was interviewed and furnished
the following information:

She is the daughter of rotect
identity throughout this document) and Her father
died in 1992, and her mother, while in 8a , continues to
reside in Uhrichville, Ohio.

' Her mother contacted her on Tuesday, September 12,

‘ 1995, and told her that an Agent of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) had telephonically contacted her that evening
and questionned her as to her late husband's relationship with
the FBI many years earlier, and that it had greatly worried her
mother. He er told her that she had lived in fear for many
years that relationship with the FBI would be
made public, and her mother had been looking over her shoulder
for years in the fear that she, her children, or grandchildren
w ally harmed in retaliation for the work that

had done for the FBI. Her mother told ney that
because of this fear, she hoped with all her heart that
would never be identified as an FBI informant.

. While she was grwong up in the 1940's, -50's and-60's,
she had a non-specific knowledge that her father had some kind of
relationship with the FBI, but it was one he never talked about,
and never discussed with her or her brother or sister. She
believes this is true because he wanted to protect her from
knowledge that could have somehow caused her harm or put her in
danger. She too, along with her mother, has had a long-time fear
that her father's informant status with the FBI would somehow be
made public, and that she or other members of her family would be

in very real physical danger from unknown persons who would want

to retaliate against her father for his FBI involvement. Since

the FBI contact with her mother on September 12, 1995, she has

discussed this issue with her brother, and he has _~
told her that he feels the same way, and that he believes the :
threat of physical harm is a very real one if their father's FBI
informant status were ever to be made public in any way.
