; a. On the morning of 1 December 1963, PARMUTH assisted RESCIGNO
in installing audio microphones under the flooring of an LCHARVEST occupied
apartment. (See HMMA-22608, li Dec 63, para 5.d.) Lines leading from the
audio installation to the LP were strung and secured below the flooring which had
ample semi-crawling space between the target area and the LP apartment.
RESCIGNO and PARMUTH entered this crawling space by removing a small
section of flooring located inside the LP apartment. There is also a trap door
leading into the crawl space at the front entrance hall of the building although
the curious. would be discouraged to enter this area because of stagnant water
six to ten inches deep on the floors at all times, cob webs, bugs, etc.s etCrce

LP covering the LCOHARVEST apartment as reported in para 5,a. of this report.
The purpose of this visit was to unlock a closed door which etored the LP equip-
ment which monitors LCHARVEST activities in that apartment. Although the
basehouse keeper had a key which worked well for several days previously, the
lock would not open for the agent on the afternoon of 6 December. PARMUTH
entered the apartment at 0130 hours on 7 December and unlocked the door. It
_was found that the throw polt located ingide the lock was broken. For security
purposes, two other locks were removed from other doors located in the same
room to check if these locks were in the same bad condition. In each case,
when the key was inserted into the lock and turned excessively, the throw bolt .

camera. The complek system was then dismantled us SWINEHART so that L-22
could re-install the system from the beginning. This was done by L-22 and met -
with SWINEHART's satisfaction, Although the Consulate door was closed to the - ’
public for a period of six days for unknown reasons as of the nivh

1963, tests were made using the SEQUENCE camera photographing people walking
by the Consulate door. The caméra worked well and produced good printable
negatives, On the morning of 18 December 1963, L-22 contacted PARMUTH and
explained that the Consulate door was now open to the public and receiving
Visitors as of 1010 that day. PARMUTH and SWINEHART joined L-22 shortly
later at the LIERODE basehouse and found that the camera system was working
well and pfiotographing people entering and leaving this target area. SWINEHART
then processed this film at the Station lab and made sample prints of the day's
take to be presented to the COS and C/PBRUMEN for their approval. Both were
very pleased with the photographic results using this type of camera equipment,
at the LIERODE basehouse. As of this reporting, the SEQUENCE camera is
using approximately 100 feet of Plus X film between 0900 and 1400 hours (office
hours for the Consulate), L-23 uses the present dark room area to photograph
traffic entering and leaving the front gate of the Embassy and is on duty from -
0800 to 1800 hours daily, six days a week, In order for L-22 to process the film .
from both of these cameras and make prints daily, it will Be necessary to install
another darkroom at the basehouse. L-~-22 will neéd a Morse Tank for processing
film, a drying rack, anda small P AKO dryer for finishing prints in order to
satisfy PBRUMEN requirements at the Station,
