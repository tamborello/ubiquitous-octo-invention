‘From lump sum money received by Subject in the
latter part of 1972 and 1973, Subject purchased three
large lots located on a canal to open water in Oriental, |
North Carolina. Total purchase price was $15, 000. 00
and the current list price for similar lots is about ;

~ $9,000.00 per lot. Investment in the new residence
is circa $70,000. 00 (not including price of lots) and there
is no encumbrance on this property. There is adequate
reason to believe the above property is currently worth |
$100,000.00 or more. The automobiles of Subject are.
paid for and he owes about $9,000. 00 to be: paid out of
the approximately $35,000.00 equity in original residence
when sales contract is completed.

3. In general terms, Subject, when sales contract ‘on
“previous residence is completed, will have his current property
fully paid for, owe nothing on personal effects and have $25,000. 00
as a financial reserve which he intends to place ina Savings.a and Loan
facility or in three or more Time Deposits.
