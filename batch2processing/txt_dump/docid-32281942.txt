 

f. General Carter pointed out that reference to support of all
Cuban exile groups (number 48) is impractical,

The word was changed
to selected,

Be Mr. Martin cautioned that results of number 50 (actions to

be undertaken by other Hemisphere governments) would not be’ expected
overnight.

h. General Carter urged that,

in connection with number 22

(submarine broadcasts), General Lansdale should be given more latitude
in working up other deception possibilities. Mr. Bundy felt, on the
other hand, that particularly because of the possible Cuban counter-
measures which had been outlined by Mr. Murrow,

the Group should look
at other possibilities in some detail.

 

i. General Carter felt that a determination should be made as
to how far the U.S.

is prepared to go in economic harrassing actions.
He emphasized that sabotage Operations such as those under number 27

will not in themselvés be especially effective in Wrecking the Cuban

5. A suggestion was made that small explosives or incendiaries which
could be distributed to Cubans should be infiltrated. General Carter
explained that the problem is not one of such supplies, since they can
be easily improvised, but rather that the people have shown no inclination

to use such materials despite many exile claims to the contrary,

6. It was suggested that the matter of attacking and harrassing of

 

Soviet personnel within Cuba should be considered.

7. The Attorney General and Mr. Bundy said that no reprisals against |

exiles who undertake active operations on their own are contemplated.

8. It was suggested,that the possibilities of counterfeiting be looked

into further.

9. General Carter urged again that a decision be reached as to how
‘much latitude would be allowed the operating elements of the government,
within broad policy lines. The Chairman indicated that it would not be

a simple matter to delegate responsibilities of this kind to any great

degree,

wo 10. Mr. Bundy then raised the basic question of the entire spectrum

of other contingencies beyond those envisaged in the MONGOOSE program.
