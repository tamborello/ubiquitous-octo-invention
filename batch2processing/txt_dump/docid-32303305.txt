DETAILS: AT CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

CG T-1 on July 31, 1963, advised that on the
evening of July 29, 1963, GUS ZAPAS and a fellow known
to him only as "New York PETE" were drinking at
"Orlando's Hideaway" located on Mannheim Road just north
of the Sahara Motel. Orlando's Hideaway is reportedly owned
by "Syndicate" representatives and is presently believed
managed by a former bartender named BARNEY (LNU). With
ZAPAS on the evening of July 29, 1963, was a 60 year old
short, stubby man who was accompanied by a beautiful blonde
about one third his age. CG T-1 stated that ZAPAS reportedly
spends considerable time at Orlando's Hideaway. ; . |

By letter dated September 3, 1963, the Royal - “~
Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Ottawa, Ontario, Canada,
advised the FBI that GILBERT RICHARD DAVIS, Jr. and THOMAS
CORRIGAN were observed meeting with HYMAN STERNMAN during
a visit to Toronto by the latter on August 29, 1963; ~ . |
The RCMP did not have any further particulars regarding 2 |
this meeting, however, assumed it was connected with union ‘ 1
activities in view of the previous STERNMAN - ZAPAS connection.

It should be noted that the RCMP previously advised . ‘
that HYMAN STERNMAN is a prominent figure in the gambling ‘
fraternity and was once engaged in "gray" steel marketing
in Chicago where he obtained steel in tight markets.

It should further be noted that numerous telephone
calls have been made from the offices of Local 46 to DAVIS

and CORRIGAN in Canada during the past fof years. ple :

CG T-2 advised that "BARNEY a very good
friend of GUS ZAPAS, is selling ste¢ Side line and
is also working at the Palmer House in a capacity unknown
to him. BAKER has been exhibiting paintings and telling
people the paintings are his work, however, he confided to
CG T-2 that the paintings were actually the work of a fellow
inmate at Sandstone Penitentiary who did not want the paintings
and gave them to BAKER,
