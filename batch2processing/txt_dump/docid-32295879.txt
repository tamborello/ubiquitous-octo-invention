California several months previously in an attempt to
collect money by representing themselves as members of an
anti-CASTRO movement. It is doubtful they collected any

sizeable amount of money. Their practice is to contact

local chapters of the John Birch Society, claiming they are
anti-Communist freedom fighters, and ask for money to carry
on their work. “They do obtain some money this way, and

use the money for living expenses.

   
 

 

In October, 1963, according to MM T-1, HALL and
SEYMOUR visited Dallas, Texas, trying to collect money

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

The following infsrmation is submitted to re-
flect the activities of LORAN EUGENE HALL in the Miami
area.

On July 9, 1999, RUBEN“MIRO-GUARDIA, a Panamanian’
then residing in Miami, advised that in April, 1959, he
was detained by Cuban Police in Havana, Cuba. During his
detention he met a United States citizen named LORAN HALL,
who was also under detention at the time. HALL, a white
male, approximately 30 years of age, 5'10" tall, black
hair, said he was from the State of Kansas, and had served
in the United States Armed Forces fer about six years.

HALL told MIRO that he had arrived in Cuba in about March,
1959, and had subsequently been contacted by CAMILO
CIENFUEGOS , a Cuban Rebel Army Commander. CIENFUEGOS wanted
HALL te train a group of men who were goine to participate
in an invasion of Nicaragua. HALL claimed he trained a
group of men on a farm known as La Liga, located near
Havana. HALL said the food for the trainees came from the
Cuban Military Staff Headquarters, on the orders of
CIENFUEGOS .

MIRO stated that HALL said he was arrested on
April 8, 1959, by Cuban authorities, who alleged HALL was
suspected of being an FBI Agent. On MIRO's departure from
Cuba on July 7, 1959, HALI, was still in the custody of
Cuban authorities but MIRO believed that HALL was going to
be released and deperred to the United States.

LORAN EUGENE HALL

MM T=1, who has been involved in Cuban reévolu-
tionary activities for the past six years, advised on March
10, 1963, that HALL had been in Miami for about the past
three months, and associated with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING,
an American adventurer, mercenary and soldier of fortune.
MM T-1 stated HALL is disagreeable, is not liked by the
other mercenaries in Miami, is of low moral character,
and appears to have a criminal background.

on Match 18, 1963, LUISMSALBUENA, 908 S.W. 5th
| Street, Miami S Cuban exile, advised that his brother, — ;
along with some Cubans and Amexicans , was involved in
- some plan to try and overthrow the government of Haiti.
a Somehow connected with this group is an American, LORENZO "1
a HALL, also known as LAWRENCE HALL, a soldier of fortune, Se
who appears irresponsible and at one time was a member of
the Cuban Rebel Army.

 

 

&

On April 5, 1963, the Miami Office received a
telephone call from a LORENZO HALL, 142 S.W. 21st Avenue,
Apartment 6, Miami, Florida. HALL said he understood
that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelli-
gence Agency and Immigration and Naturalization Service
were trying to locate him, and he wanted to report his
address. :

On November 11, 1963, MM T-1 said that LORENZO
HALL, a white male, 25 years of age to 26 years, 5'7".
“155 pounds, ruddy complexion, was unemployed and had in-
dicated to the informant that he was from Los Angeles,
California. He is always on the move, is in and out of '
Miami, is the confidence man type, and it was not known i
if he was then in Miami. MM T-1 advised that HALL - “ /
claimed to have been in the Cuban Rebel Army, but the . |
other mercenaries in Miami doubt this. -
