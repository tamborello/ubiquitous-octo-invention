Doctor MANOPULO stated the Italian police would
be most..anxious to learn the details surrounding the arrest
and subsequent conviction of GENOVESE, particularly if any
Italian Coie were involved in criminal activities with

GENOVESE |

The above request undoubtedly emanates from the
extreme interest evinced by the Italian police-gin the recent
disclosures made by JOSEPH VALACHI concerning Oe Cosa Nostra"
and their desire to establish any possible connection wit ”
the Mafia in the United States and the Mafia in Italy. As
the Bureau is aware, an Italian Parliamentary Anti-Mafia
:; Commission is presently making a study of the Mafia in Italy

and Italian police have greatly intensified their a prea
against the Mafia, particularly in Palermo, Sicily.
