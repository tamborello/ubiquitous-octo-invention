MEHORAHDUM FOR: Domestic Collection Division

 

 

 

ATTERTION:
SUBJECT: Joseph R. HEROLA
HH 25826, 8 January 1974

3. On 30 January 1974 the WH/2/GS desk recefved the
“veferenced mesorandum from the Domestic Collection Division
indicating the Miami field office had been in contact with one
dogeph R. MEROLA. HEROLA had just returned from a business

*. trip to El Salvador; and he reported that a friend of his had

identified a Hr. Gramt}}ion in the Political Section of the
American Embassy in San Salvador as a suspect CIA representative.
Headquarters traces on Joseph R. HEROLA indicated that on several
occasions fn the past MEROLA had claimed that he was a CIA

agent. The Chief of Station, the Hr. Gremfillfton referred to .
above, was recently questioned recarding any Embassy contact
with HEROLA while the latter was in San Salvador. The COS
stated that both within the Embassy community and at soctal
functions MEROLA had frequently referred to his contact with

‘ the CIA, past and present. He also volunteered this infor-
mation to a former Station cantect.

2. Un Bight of the above, {t would appear that HEROLA
had taken advantage of his agency contacts in_an {inappropriate
. Manner to the potential embarrassment of the
Station. We would, accordingly, appreciate @ Siven

due consideration in your assessment of the advantage of your”
continued contact with hin. :
