a
Newark PCI dviced SA NORBERT R//i+
LINKER on May 29, 1963, and May 31, 1963, that he has made
inquiry among his associates concerning the WALTER GLOCKNER
murder,

His associates are of the opinion that the most
popular mctive among the gambling element is that
WALTER GLOCKNER was a shylock and that he possibly was
murdered as a result of having refused to heed and follow
orders to stop infringing on shylock territories heretofore
controlled by other shylock operations, :

GLOCKNER was murdered because he was a member of an insurgent
group in Local 560, IBT, and could possibly have furnished
damaging testimony in the extortion trial involving ANTHONY
PROVENZANO, also known as Tony Pro,

. The PCI states that GLOCKNER allegedly had a shylock
operation with ROBERT GWINNETT, This operation reportediy
centered in Hoboken, The PCI stated that ROBERT GWINNETT and
WILLIAM P, BRYAN repnrtedly received letters and/or pkone
calls shortly after the GLOCKNER murder in which tko, were
warned that they would be the next victims.

into the alleged shylock operation of GLOCKNER and
his associates,

Club Jaguar, 121 Monroe Street, Hokoken, New Jersey, which
