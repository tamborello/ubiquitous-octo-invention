_ Of possible significance in this matter is the fact that
Richard and Susan Frank traveled to China sometime between 1959 and
1961, ostensibly with the approval of the CP, USA,. Susan Frank
had been requested to work on. the "Peking Review" and would be
reimbursed by the CP of China, The Franks reportedly alse traveled
elsewhere in Europe during this period. It should be kept in mind |
that the CP, USA and CP of Canada have frequently exchanged i
information by courier and have received instructions from abroad
by this means. If Bernard Frank, of interest in this matter. is
identified as the brother of Richard Frank mentioned above, he could
possibly be involved in courier ca. (the pa if not actually involved

 

in CP matters, in the Buffalo area, (The possibility sheuld also be
kept in mind that someone other than™Bernard A, Frank, possibly |
Richard Frank, ay ays been in possession of the vehicle bearin
