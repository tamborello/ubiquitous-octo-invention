individual. There didn't have to be a conspiracy. This
was a problem that the whole country was grappling with--
the President of the United States, Attorneys General--we
were in a situation where we had rank lawlessness taking
place. As you know from the memorandum we sent you that
we sent to the Attorney General the accomplishments we were
able to obtain in preventing violence and in neutralizing
the Klan and that was one of the reasons.

»..-A local town meeting on a controversial social
issue might result in disruption. It might be by hecklers
rather than by those holding the meeting. Does this
mean that the Bureau should investigate all groups
organizing or participating in such meetings because
they may result in violent government disruption?

No sir, and we don't....

Isn't that how you justify spying on almost every
aspect of the peace movement?

No sir. When we monitor demonstrations, we monitor

demonstrations where we have an indication that the
demonstration itself is sponsored by a group that we have
an investigative interest in, a valid investigative
interest in, or where members of one of these groups are
participating where there is a potential that they might
change the peaceful nature of the demonstration.

This is our closest question of trying to draw
guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing

on the lst Amendment right, yet at the same time, being

aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers

in the past than we do at the present time. We have had
periods where the demonstrations have been rather severe
and the courts have said that the FBI has the right,

and indeed the duty, to keep itself informed with respect
to the possible commission of crime. It is not obliged
to wear blinders until it may be too late for prevention.
Now that's a good statement if applied in a clear~cut
case.

Our problem is where we have a demonstration and
we have to make a judgment call as to whether it is one
that clearly fits the criteria of enabling us to monitor
the activities. That's where I think most of our disagree-
ments fall.

In the Rowe Case, in the Rowe testimony that we just
heard, what was the rationale again for not intervening when
violence was known about. I know we have asked this several
times--I'm still having trouble understanding what the
rationale, Mr. Wannall, was in not intervening in the Rowe
situation when violence was known.

Senator Schweiker, Mr. Adams did address himself to
that and if you have no objections, I'll ask that he be
the one to answer the question.

The problem we had at the time, and it is the problem
today, we are an investigative agency; we do not have

police powers even like the U. S. Marshals do. The Marshals

MR. ADAMS:

memorandum to the Department of Justice the problem.

And here we were--the FBI--in a position where we had no
authority in the absence of an instruction from the
Department of Justice to make an arrest. Section 241
and 242 don't cover it because you don't have evidence

of a conspiracy. It ultimately resulted in a situation
where the Department called in U. S. Marshals who do have
authority similar to local law enforcement officials.

So historically, in those days, we were just as
frustrated as anyone else was, that when we got information
from someone like Mr. Rowe--good information, reliable
information--and it was passed on to those who had the
responsibility to do something about it, it was not always
acted upon as he indicated.

In none of these cases, then, there was adequate
evidence of conspiracy to give you jurisdiction to act.

The Departmental rules at that time, and still do,
require Departmental approval where you have a conspiracy.
Under 241, it takes two or more persons acting together.
You can have a mob scene and you can have blacks and whites
belting each other, but unless you can show that those that
initiated the action acted in concert, in a conspiracy, you
have no violation.

Congress recognized this and it wasn't until 1968
that they came along and added Section 245 to the Civil

Rights Statute which added punitive measures against an
QUESTION: ....You do use informants and do instruct them to
spread dissention among certain groups that they are
informing on, do you not?

MR. ADAMS: We did when we had the COINTEL programs which were
discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably one
of the best examples of a situation where the law was
ineffective at the time. We heard the term, State's Rights
used much more than we hear today. We saw with the
Little Rock situation the President of the United States
sending in the troops pointing out the necessity to use
local law enforcement. We must have local law enforcement
use the troops only as a last resort. When you have a
situation like this where you do try to preserve the
respective roles in law enforcement, you have historical
problems.

With the Klan coming along, we had situations where
the FBI and the Federal Government was almost powerless
to act. We had local law enforcement officers in some
areas participating in Klan violence. The incidents
mentioned by Mr. Rowe~~-everyone of those he saw them from the
lowest level--the informant. He didn't see what action
was taken with that information as he pointed out during
his testimony. Our files show that this information was
reported to the police departments in every instance.

We also know that in certain instances the infor-
mation upon being received was not being acted upon. We

also disseminated simultaneously through letterhead
