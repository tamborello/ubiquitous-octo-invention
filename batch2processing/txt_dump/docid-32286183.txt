husband of MU HUMPHREYS ' present wife. A lengthy discussion

|
was held PSeararie-this" Sita tion. The discussion then
centered upon the regignation of FIO RITO and MARCY and .
BRODKIN discussed the effect the publicity has had on the
organization in'general and generally decided that things
have never been as bad as they have right at this point.
MARCY mmented that it was unfortunate that GRANATA
RY PET. GRANATA, Representative to the Illinois. Senate from
vw ¢ <4 Ward) had to take such a beating in his attempt to
beat Sheriff RICHARD OGILVIE's crime bills. Of particular :
note was the fact that MARCY and BRODKIN were trying to determine
what SANDY SMITH would follow his story up with. There was
‘no doubt in their minds that SMITH has much more information
available regarding this situation and plans a series of
articles to continue blasting the First Ward in particular
and the over-all organization in general.

 
  
   
   
 

. Late in the afternoon TONY GIROLAMI met with MARCY

and ANTHONY TISCI, at which time the following took place:

(it is pointed out that oe who is identica}.. 498-PC,
was in contact with agents prior’ td Ss mee ting with MARCY and
TISCI.

GIROLAMI tells MARCY that SANDY SMITH, who wrote the story ~

about FIO RITO for the "Sun Times" got his story from a. "Sun Times"
correspondent in Washington. MARCY at first is skeptical

about his story but later appears to give credence to it.
Atmosphere seems to clear when GIROLAMI shows MARCY a copy of
today's "Daily News" about "the bang” GIROLAMI" s court got

due to bribery of court officials.

¢t

MARCY: Did MIKE call them guys back and tell them
. he was gonna resign? ROEMER?
_ GEROLAMI: I don t think so. I don't think so.
MARCY: | What's his opinion of MIKE now? oe
GIROLAMI : He's dead. ,

-GIROLAMI again repeats that SANDY SMITH's Washington correspondent
_got the story for him. He again points out that "The Tribune”
broke the story, not SMITH and the "Sun Times." PAT didn't :
know that but accepts it when GIROLAMI insists he can check it.

The above is self explanatory as to the developments
as they occurred and.gives a clear picture as to how the
situation rests at this moment. It is felt by the Chicago
Division that they have succeeded beyond expectations in
disrupting the entire political organization of the First Ward
Democratic organization. It is interesting to note that

\ strong consideration is being given to the possibility of
GIROLAMI being made Alderman of the First Ward. Further
information concerning this situation is being submitted in
a separate airtel this date under the caption "MURRAY HUMPHREYS,
aka, AR" which sets forth further information obtained from
CG 6498-PC, which incorporates information received this date
from GIROLAMI: concerning a conversation held by GIROLAMI with
FIO RITO in Florida which indicates that FIO RITO is desirous
of meeting with Agents ROEMER and RUTLAND following his return
and discussing the possibilities | of his returning to the post
of First Ward Alderman in a year's time. At this point it
appears that the Chicago Division is in an excellent position
at this time to have either a present informant or an
individual who indicates close cooperation with the Government
should he be elected to the post as the next Alderman of the
First Ward. In further regard to this matter, the following
information is furnished regarding an editorial which appeared
in the 5/8/63 edition of the "Chicago Daily News" regarding
the First Ward developments. .The editorial pointed out the
irregularities which had occurred in the running of candidates
for First Ward Alderman and continued that had not the FBI
taken an interest in the matter the irregularities would have

\ been allowed to stand up and go uncontested. The editorial
was extremely laudatory of the FBI's position in uncovering
the situation and forcing the situation into the open whereby
FIO RITO has eventually withdrawn and the aiaitatahe situation
aired.

It was learned that contact was made with Attorney
General ROBERT KENNEDY by the "Chicago American*s" Washington
correspondent for the purpose of obtaining his comments as
to the FBI participation in the investigation into the
First Ward situation which contact apparently was the
forerunner to an article which appeared in the 5/8/63 edition
‘of the "Chicago American" to the effect that "Attorney General
ROBERT KENNEDY today praised the increased efforts of the
FBI.....in the all-out battle against organized crime and
corruption of public officials."
