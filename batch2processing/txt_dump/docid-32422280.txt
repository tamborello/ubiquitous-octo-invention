Astion Required: Renew the Project
Reference: HiMW-11879

1. On 28 Jume 1963 we pouched to Headquarters the renewal
for Project LIMOTOR under HMMA~-21650. We had every reason to
believe that after a plausible period of time that the Project
was undergoing usual Headquarters processing for renewal. We
were therefore astonished and disappointed to say the least to
leam in Reference (which we received on 19 September, and the
separate cover to which we recelved on 17 Septenber) that on
1 August a Project Extension was requested and not a Project
Renewal. In future instances we request that you notify the
Station immediately when the usuel steps for renewal have not
been taken, particularly where Projects are only extended and
where you expect the Station to reply three days after the
receipt of a dispatch in order to allow for timely Headquarters
submissions about which the Station was belatedly notified.
Other priorities have precluded earlier response to Reference,

2. In the interest of time and efficiency ve propose to
answer below the questions posed in paragraph 5 of attachrent

3. The following sub-paragvaphs are keyed to Paragraph 5
of attachyent to Referance:

a. During the past Project year, 1 August 1962 through
Ji duly 1953, the LIMOTOR comlex prodwed 103 individual
personality reporte; 43 from Seymour D. TRINNICH, 2 from
_ LIBMGROIL-2, 2 fram LIFOTOR-14, 43 from LIPOTOR-19, and 13
from LINCTOR22. These personality reports can he catesorized
as follows: personalities known or suspected te belong to
or be identified with pre-commnist polities] groupings
or philescphies, including Amerienne; Soviet personalities
(LITALON-3); potential operational leada; particularly
as lt concerns the LIMCTOR effort against the Maxziean
eamterpart of ODACID (saa VI, PLANS of the LIMOTOR Projeat
‘Renewal already forwarded), These personality reporta
hot include the LINOTOR coverage of UTIN lecture series
ven by known anti-fmerlean speakers (most of which originated
with LIMGQOR-22) nor the regular list of UNAM Seheol for
Yoreigners obtained by LIMOTOR-19). The LIMOTOR personality
reports fave not received dissemination, bit aro aids in
terms of CI information end requasts from local customers;
specifie reports are passed to area officers and have been
found to be most useful.

b - During the project year 1 Aurust 1962 = 3) July
2963, the LIMOTOR ceapler produced 11 reports on elections
held in the various faeulties of UNAM (two from Seymour
D. TRINNICH, 4 fram LIERBROTL-2, 1 from LIMCTON-19, end
& from LIMOTOR-22), These reports are considered omeLlent
corroporative information to the efforts of LICOAN according
to the Statica KWOLF element. Direstly related te the
eleetion reports are the reports on individual student rarsy
activities about which LIMOTOR prodused eleven roports
wWhdeh the Station's KUSOLF element ia st1211 vost interested

. in receiving on a priority basis. During the period of
tho student riots and other activities eomected with the
euster of Ell de Gartarl Morelia, LIMOTOR produced three
reports eonfirming Station efforts. Reports heve also
been produced on the LILISP-C, LINUPF Student group, and
LICGAX, elthough not in the quantit® des{red. This embasis
hag been refleeted in the present project year. LIMUTOR-22
has plso reported on LICOAX harnastemt activities ab UNAM
and in one instance was a vietim of same,

Ge Through joint conversations between the KUYOLP
elerent and the LIROTOR staffers, epre defined areas of

we hope to be able to produce more pesitive intelligence
Giaseminaticns from the LIMOTOR Project.

ad. The following are exemples of LIMOTOR information

whieh was of value to Station ease officers:

(1) For the KUMOLF officers see sub-paragrarh
abow,

(2) A ehgck with eadquarters BRDOX elements
will elearly rovaal the emtribution ande by LIMOPOR-19
to the BECHICK/BEEMNAVE ease. This was clearly pointed-
out in tho Projet Renewal subsdasion (please see IT
ASSEPS, C. LEMOTOR-19}, During the past project
year LIMOPOR-19 submitted 12 written reperts on
her contests with SECHICK. In addition several
special meetings vere held with her, TRIRNICH and
Phineas F, SLINKARD for the purpose of briefing and
debriefing her on the BECHICE/EEKNAVE ease. Her most
effective role in providing the Station with parallel
developments in thin important ease has drawn the eenstut
pratee of SLIRKARD. :

(3) Gerald P. GRSTETHER levied a requirerent

"an the LISCTOR project to produce a lead of a person

who could be used as aceess to a leeal Soviet Imeun to te
GE and considered a REDCAP possibility. Several rerorts
on this ised were submitted by Seymour D. RINNICH, howe
ever, this has not further developed to date. LIMOTGR-19
also submitted several reports on a Station lead who was
8 REDSOX candidate, This aleo did not materialise, but
represented a@ speelal LIMCTOR effort for a Station ease
officer.

(4) During the sumer of 1963, the Station DIZPAG
element in tha person of Phineas 7, SLINKARD requested
the LIMOTOR complex to prodvee a lead into the leeal
DIZPAG cultural society and thus to the local DIZTAG
diploratie installation. Although Seymour B. THOVICH

lead never materlalised bub was en examle of its value
