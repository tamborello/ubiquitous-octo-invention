Rerep SA WILBERT H, KEHE dated 11/14/57 at San Francisco
and Bulet 12/5/57.

Enclosed herewith are four copies of amended page 3, as
requested in relet, setting forth documentation for MARVIN MURRY,
rm aka MARVIN MURRAY, in paragraph 2. San Francisco has corrected
\\ its copies. SF T-12, mentioned in the amended page 3, is SF-2175-S,
Ww and the information is located in SF 100-36015-38. T-12 has
BUN furnished reliable information in the past.

It should be noted that MURRY is identical with Bureau
references on MARVIN RICHARD MURRY according to SF 1923-S, who has
furnished considerable information on MURRY and is acquainted with
him. It is not believed necessary to initiate a security investi-
gation on MARVIN RICHARD MURRY at the present time, inasmuch as
he has been outlawed by the CP, which knows him as an “anformer, "
For that reason, he also has no potential as an informant, as well
as for the reason that he is very unstable, evidenced by an at-
tempt to blackmail his own parents and a threat to kill his mother.

No further information is available regarding the report
he was requested to prepare by PITTMAN and it is not believed ad-
visable to contact MURRY himself to obtain this information, in
view of his mental condition and instability. Information is re-
ceived on MURRY from time to time through established security
informants in Stanislaus County, the area of his residence.

SF 100-1465

On 12/15/53 MURRY telephonically contacted Resident Agent
EDWARD F, CHARBONNEAU in the San Jose Resident Agency and volun-
teered information concerning JOHN and ROSLYN LINDESMITH.

In connection with the case of DAVID MC KAIL FORBES, MURRY
was contacted on Bureau instructions by SA.ROBERT F. SAVAGE on
2/18/57, at which time he stated that he did not desire to testify
and did not want his identity disclosed. He explained that he had
only recently been able to talk or visit with his mother, LILLIAN
MAY MURRY, who is one of the CP leaders in Stanislaus County.
MURRY stated that he is most anxious to have his mother break with
the CP because he feels her membership is the cause of all family
trouble, and he stated that although he wished to cooperate with
the FBI, he would prefer to assist his mother and family.

It should be noted that information volunteered by MURRY
has proved reliable in that other informants in the area have ‘sub-
stantiated it. It is not believed MURRY should be contacted for
information which he does not see fit to volunteer, however, be-
cause of his instability and mental condition illustrated by the
following instances: -

(1) On 9/2/53, both SF 1604-s ‘and SF 1923-S reported
that MURRY attempted to blackmail his parents for
$1000, threatening to tell the FBI about them un-
less they gave him the money. Subsequently, in
October, 1953, he did volunteer information to the
FBI.

(2) SF 1604-S on 7/8/54 reported that MURRY's mother ~

stated he was a mental case and had threatened to
kill her.
