Memorandum from John A. Hartingh to Mrs. Morris, dated 11/7/95
Re: JFK TASK FORCE

In view of the above, in approximately seven to
fourteen calendar days, the source/informant index cards will be
removed from storage boxes, placed in three file cabinets, and
temporarily transferred to a secure space maintained by the JFK
Task Force in Room 6362. The cards will continue to serve as a
research tool for the Task Force, being accessed by only two
Special File Room employees currently detailed to the Task Force.
The two employees possess the seven security clearances assigned
to them as Special File Room employees which permit them
appropriate access to the index cards.

The retention of these cards by the JFK Task Force will
be in effect until it has completed the project; has been
approved by the Criminal Investigative Division (CID) and the
National Security Division (NSD). Jerry R. Donahoe, Unit Chief,
Asset Unit, NSD and Neil F. Divers, Unit Chief Sensitive
Information Unit, CID, were contacted and approved the transfer
of the source/informant index cards. In addition, Pamela E.
Marshall, File Supervisor of the Special File Room was consulted
regarding this matter and agreed to the transfer of the cards.
