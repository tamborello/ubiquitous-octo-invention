. Mr. David L. Christ is recommended for the Intelligence Medal
of Merit in recognition of his career of especially meritorious service

which has contributed significantly to the missions of CIA.

- Mr. Christ joined CIA in November of 1950 as the first research
and development electronics engineer in what has evolved as TSD. He
created an Applied Physics Branch setting high standards for himself
and the R&D engineers he recruited. His accomplishments included the
anti-disturbance mine and the time pencil, both of which are still

- Agency stock items, and an IR beacon. As a pioneer in audio surveillance
devices, he. recognized very. early that. the use of systems concept
would be most productive in meeting Agency needs. As part of his
development program, his efforts led to the establishment of specialized
contract facilities such as which in 1953 was the first
Agency source of transistorized equipment .-4

 

In early 1957, Mr. Christ was made Chief of what is now the Audio
Operations Branch of TSD and, realizing that a drastic upgrading of
the caliber of field technicians was required, began aggressively re-
cruiting and training graduate engineers. His high standards and
efforts in this area are reflected in the fact that the majority of
TSD Audio mid-management personnel were recruited by him. In September
1960, he and two associates were apprehended while on an operation in

a denied area.’ His exemplary conduct and personal courage
during the resulting two and one-half years incarceration
permitted the maintenance of a very difficult cover situation
and successful extraction of all three men.

“ Upon his return, Mr. Christ joined the Office of Research
and Development soon after its inception, assisting in the
definition and establishment of the various divisions. Under
his early guidance, the over-the-horizon radar program developed
finally into an operational system. His sensitivity to the
needs of Agency operational elements based upon his experience,
his technical expertise and his dedicated desire to broaden
the technological capabilities of the Agency precipitated
his development of a major coordinated program of accelerated
R&D to provide the clandestine services with a number of new
audio surveillance techniques of which the laser probe is an .
example, and his conception and direction of the Microtechnology
R&D program. Within this program, the success of the micro-
power transistor led to the award of Medals of Merit to two
scientists under his supervision. Other progeny of the micro-
technology concept are three novel intelligence gathering
systems to function in the air, in space, and in the sea
environments, one of which is approaching operational status.
Mr. Christ has also been responsible for pioneering efforts
in the area of Audio Surveillance Countermeasures, first pro-~-
posing the application of computers to the problem.

Mr. Christ's imaginative leadership and inspiration to
those working with him, his broad scope of interest, his resource-
fulness, and philosophical devotion to the cause of the Agency
and the United States have provided this Agency with an individua)
whose unique efforts and accomplishments over his 20 years
service are worthy of this recognition.
