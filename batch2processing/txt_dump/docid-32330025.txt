HUGHES claims that he was the organizer. of
the invasion and that he was working’ with ROLANDO ©
MASFERRER, He said he was anxious to return.to Miami
'.in order to make arrangements for further- supplies to
‘be delivered to the twenty=seven men in Cuba. “He said:
he had'the promise of 800 sten guns from some sympathizers :
_in South America to help further invasions of Cuba, and BS
- /that he-intended to operate off the Cuban coast with ‘a
boat ‘about the size of the "Aladino,"' but which was more
_ economical-in fuel. HUGHES alleged that the U. S. Ly
_ authorities boarded the "Aladino" after she left Miami; ‘
- but asked°no questions about the large number of men on.
. board, ‘declined to search for arms, and wished them good
“luck and allowed them to proceed. (si.

as : While ‘the "Sunsport'' was at Castle Island

- either. on. its outward journey or‘on its return from —
“Cuba; “(it isnot clear which), it was contacted by :
‘an airplane piloted, so WILLIAMS, believes, by JULIO |
““(LNU.) - Messages were dropped asking if they were.in . .
trouble and if the men had. been put. ashore in Cuba.(S)_

oo On October 11, -1960, WILLIAMS returned'to . ~ !
Nassau to claim the: "Sunsport.'" Among the” documents :
' found on the "Sunsport" was a letter addressed to-

“. Senor SANTIAGO ALVAREZ, 701 S. W. 8th Street, Miami \-

. According to subsequent. press reports, fifteen
“at ‘least of the twenty-seven men put ashore in Cuba have
. been captured and executed. Three of these were Americans,
‘ANTHONY ZARBA, DALE THOMPSON, and ROBERT 0. FULLER: Press
. reports also say that HUGHES himself has been arrested,
so he must. have returned to Cuba after leaving Nassau
‘on October 8.(S] —

; In January, 1960, HUGHES, together with a man
“galled MATTHEW DURE, used the airstrip at Great Exuma
‘as a jumping off point for a fire-raising raid on some
. Cuban sugar fields. In May, 1960, DUKE was killed in Cuba
while trying to exfiltrate someone from. that country.(s\ | ,

Street and 8th Avenue, Miami, and is’a merchant shipping
mechanic. ~ The original intention was that the "Aladino"
should go straight to Cuba and then return to the Castle
Island fendezvous, where she would be refueled from the

~ "Sunsport." Owing to incompetent navigation, she ran

aground several times’ on her. outward journey ‘through

Bahamas waters and ran out of fuel.) By the ‘time'Aladino"

reached Castle Island lighthouse on about the first of

October, her engines were in poor condition and it was

not safe for her to proceed any further. The invasion

party of twenty-seven men was transferred to the

"Sunsport" and on about the-fourth of October were

landed at’a point one-and-achalf miles southeast of

Baracod light in Oriente Province, Cuba, where accord--

ing to WILLIAMS they were given a hearty welcome by the —
villagers. ($\

ce The "Sunsport" then returned to Castle Island
and found that the "Aladine” had gone aground wear the
lighthouse, the anchor having broken; She is likely _
to become a total wreck, After a day's delay, GONZALEZ. ~
and MARRERO were taken aboard the "Sunsport" with five
carbines, one rifle and twenty-two rounds of assorted ~ !
°30,°<38 and .45 anmunition, which did not fit the guns.

According to HUGHES, these weapons were withdrawn from ~

the invasion party (who were armed with carbines, rifles ._ i
and revolvers), because of their doubtful serviceability.(s)

- The "Sunsport" then set course for Nassau, but
as shewas running out of fuel, put in to Georgetown; Great ;
Exuma, where she arrived on October: 7; By this time, the
Bahamas police had become suspicious that something was
going on and the four men were taken into custody. WILLIAMS
and HUGHES were subsequently allowed to return to the
U.S. om about October 8, 1960. It is not clear where
the two Cubans are at the moment. (3\

tion. which invaded Cuba. during the first part of October,
1960, reported backed by ROLANDO MASFERRER. ts)

~~ On or about September 24, 1960, FRANK WILLIAMS,
_ 117 North Flagler Avenue, Homestead, Florida, fisherman.
' and owner of the "Sunsport," was approached in Marathon, |
Florida Keys, by a man called’" JULIO" (LNU), who asked
him to take a load of petrol to refuel another boat at ~~
_gea, WILLIAMS is the owner of the diesel-engined converted
L; ¢.° Vv. P., the "Sunsport,'' registered in Florida. with
License No. FI45285A. WILLIAMS was offered $100.00 a
day for’ this job which “he accepted. He subsequently
loaded the "Sunsport" in Miami with twenty drums of high
test gasoline amounting to l, 100 gallons. (s

On. September 26, 1960, the "Sungport,"" « with
WILLIAMS as captain, and. accompanied. by PAUL HUGHES,

revolutionaries on board, had left Miami at about the o
same time as the "Sunsport."' The captain was a Cuban:
