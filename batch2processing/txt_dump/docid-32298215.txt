Regarding the Sicilian’; group of the “organization"
in Youngstown, CV 344-C stated he could not say if
VINCENT J. DE NIRO, bombing-murder victim, 7/17/61, was
a member of. the "organization" or not, but stats
DE NIRO's murders caused great concern among £1. ners
of the “organization”. He stated that of < all the murders
committed in the Youngstown area, this was the cnly murder
where members of the "organization" made active efforts to
determine the persons responsible for same. He cited inquiry {
by PRATO, TRIPODI of Steubenville and RIPEPI of PG, as
DE .NIRO was a big source of income for the group and was
cooperative.

   

cv 344-c stated that the "organization" made no
inquiry with him following the bombing-murder of CAVALLARO
and for this reason he believes CAVALLARO was killed for
| getting "out of line". He stated if he had been killed
without the sanction of the "organizatinn" they would have
: inquired as to » killed one of their members, He stated
| that in his cpimdion CAVALLARO had a portién of DE NIRO's
j operation an‘ parently tried to "hog’ the entire operation

   
    
     

     
 

tegerding..JASPER JOSEP ELLO J hee oka "Fats",
the informant advised he no J 1e. n high fespect
because he has "gotten out of Line! by bad publicity and
by engaging in armed robbery and burglary. He stated that
AIELLO had formerly been well thought of and in Youngstown
was on about the same level as ANTHONY DELSANTER presently
is in Warren,

. Informant stated WILLIAM NAPLES, bombing-murder
“victim, 7/1/62, was killed because the "organization" learned !
he was responsible for killing DE NIRO. According to the

_ informant, the NAPLES brothers were not part of either
the Calabrese or the Sicilian groups and did not contribute
to either group.

 

Regarding the killing of IOMINICK MOIO, whose
pody was found stuffed in the trunk of his car at Canton,
Ohio, 94/63, informant stated the "organization" made no
inquiry about his death which would mean to him that
MOIO had "gotten out of line". MOIO had somehow obtained
employment with the NAPLES brothers and unquestionably
"set up" BILLY‘NAPLES for his murder. CV 344- C stated MOIO

; : In connection with the influence of-the Calabrese group |
headed by ANTHONY MILANO of Cleveland, CV 3’41-C save the following |
as an illustration: He stated that in abouts 1955 he backed a ‘
sheriff's candidate in Mansfield, hoping that if he was elected
he would be able to open a house of prostitution in Mansfield
and within the jurisdiction of the sheriff. The candidate was |
elected without any support whatsoever of TONY MOLLICA. He
started his house of prostitution, which was a money making
proposition and shortly thereafter MOLLICA approached him and
told him that people in town were talking and saying that he,
MOLLICA, was responsible for the house being able to operate
and it was giving him a bad name because "members" are not.
supposed to engage in prostitution. Informant told MOLLICA that
he had nothing to worry about as he was not involved, and it
then became apparent that MOLLICA was trying to get part of the

- operation and profit. MOLLICA then turned to M'¥E ROMEO of
Poland, Ohio, brother of PAUL ROMEO of Campbell, who was a friend
of informantis father, and ROMEO called on the informant on
pehalf of MOLLICA, ROMEO told informant that he was "out of line”
and was giving MOLLICA a bad reputation in that he had moved
into MOLLICA's territory. ROMEO told cv 344-C te close the house
for a couple of months so that everything would "cool" down.
Informant refused and told ROMEO he was not out of line and
secured his own "fix" by backing the sheriff in the election
and the sheriff wanted nothing to do with MOLLICA and would not }
allow him to operate anything. Informant stated he was mad
about this interference and then wrote a letter to his father

' in Buenos Aires and later received an answer to the letter,

With the answer he was instructed to take the letter to
PINDELLI's good friend, ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland, and
according to CV 344-c, he did this. A couple of days later
informant was called by "WHITEY" BESASE, who instructed him

to come to Akron to the home of JAMES LA FATCH for a meeting.

He was told to come there with MOLLICA, but informant refused
stating he was not going to be "dumped" en route or at the meeting.
He then called MILANO in the presence of MOLLICA and told MILANO
what they wanted of him. MILANO instructed MOLLICA that he was
instructing "the kid" (the informant) to accompany him to

Akron, and told MOLLICA that if a "hair on the head of PANDELLI”
was harmed he would see that the whole bunch was taken care of,
Informant then got on the phone and was instructed by MILANO

to go to Akron with MOLLICA and everything was going to be all

i page 28, report of SA JAMES FLYNN, 7/1/63, "LA COSA NOSTRA",
CHARLES CAVALLARO was in PG at this period and cv 344-c

a advises he would be known by GUISSEPPI PINDELLI.

cy 344-c stated that following PINDELLI's deportation
to Italy, he slipped back into the United States about two
months later and lived all over the United States with : :
members of the "organization", He and his family later
moved to Warren, Ohio, and about 1941 or 1942 at the beginning ©
of World War II when it was necessary for aliens to register
PINDELLI nas arrested by Warren, Ohio PD and held for
INS. Inasmuch as the U.S. was at war with Italy, it was
impossible to deport PINDELLI and he was placed on bond :
of $50,000, which was put up by members of the "organization."
When the. war ended and it appeared that PINDELLI's arrest was
imminent, the "organization" indicated to him thathe should
take off and skip his bond. He had apparently made satisfactory
arrangements with them, and he was not making enemies in
skipping the bond. According to the informant, PINDELLI
then left Warren and traveled with a carnival based on
the West Coast through Calif., Oregon and Washington. PINDELLI
was later arrested at informant's brother, FRANK's, home
at South Gate, Calif, arideported again to Italy. PINDELLI
later immigrated legally to Buenos Aires, where his prother
-ANTHONY PINDELLI, now deceased, was residing and where .
PINDELLI remains today. According to informant PINDELLI -

at 1372 Centenera, Capital 24, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
