a. Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer, It requires —
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather. than the
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following: :

(1) Duplicate material, i.e, exact copy(s) of a document.

(2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for
_ the opening. st

(3) All abstract stips, ; Sk ue,
' (4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

   
    
  

(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 20] file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report...

(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch ,

ed. in- “other. documents in-the file, ‘authorization for destruction is
the Records Officer. :

(8) Top Secret documents are not to. be retained in a 201 L dossier
forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention -
in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized
officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification
authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained . {ols

THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-I) 27 October 1986

. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

'_ information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying

subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for ©
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories..Only a rela-__
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated. ; :

 

201 SYSTEM ee

 

a. The 201 Number: : a unique number, ie. 201-1234567, assigned to each

. individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that

individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
831) and all biographic reporting om and references to the individual, i ie., > pet- 7

sonal history, current status, and prospects.

” e. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of -
a 20] file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved! for special listings.

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be mov: ed up and the ref-
erence consolidated.

e. OI Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OL codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or .
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI
codes for use by components:

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)

: (2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
ie ' or other specific organizations.

A component may request an OI code be’ established by submitting a mem-

orandum to the DDO/RMO throvgh the component Records Management
Officer.

A 201 personality may y be assigned two OI codes. An OI coder may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned, or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER : ‘
a. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates
a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the eccasional closing
of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 20] dossiers may be ~
opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this = -
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened -on
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-
sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those
persons for whom provisional operational. approvals and operational approvals
are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff
employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

persons who are only of local interest to a field station or Headquarters desk
and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO |
records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require-
ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings en certain categories of persons whose

dossiers should be opened in the following categories: . tet aF

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-
proval requests. However, a file need not be ‘opened when a POA is requested
for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-

"tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.

(3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of ‘other than
; denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel,

 

(4) Subjects of a Personal Revord  Quesionnate Part I.

 
  
     
  
  

or more documents (see DOI 70-20). -

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from ISN/
ISR (opened only by TP/RMS).

b. Requesting a 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling 0 out - and submitting
a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign-
ment of a cryptonym to a 20] personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201’s. A field
station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-.
quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after’ the
subject’s name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening
is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by
placing 201- after the term “File” on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN
will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it-is the responst-
bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of
201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.
