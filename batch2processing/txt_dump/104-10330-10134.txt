It has been heard that during a USSR reception on
7 November of this year, the third secretary of the Cuban
Embassy in the Hague, Richardo SANTOS MESA, was asked about
CASTRO’s reaction to attacks on Cuba by Cuban exiles. He
replied “Just wait, and you: will see what we can do; it will
happen soon.” (quoted response given in English in the :
original)

SANTOS declined to elaborate.

It has also been heard that SANTOS has a brother who lives
in the United States as an “exile.”

Although this brother is pro-Castro, he is said to have
left Cuba at the urging of his conservative wife.

SANTOS is said to exchange correspondence with this
brother. .
