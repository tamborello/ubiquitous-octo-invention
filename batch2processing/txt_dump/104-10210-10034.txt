C. KGB Headquarters

1. Structure and Functions

 

  

Prior to NOSENKO's contact with CIA in June 1962, tho
most recent information on KGB structure and functions had::
been provided by GOLITSYN, whose information was current as
of December 1961 when he defected. GOLITSYN.'s data and that
from the Polish defector GOLENIEWSKI wero the first detailed: -
new information on this subject available to the U.S. intel.
ligence community since 1954, when DERYABIN, RASTVOROV,
PETROV, and KHOKHLOV defected, just prior to the change-over
fron the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) to the Committee
for State Security (KGB). GOLENIEWSKI and GOLITSYN nad re-
ported on the 1959 reorganization of the KGB, the first major
realignment of the KGB's functions since the abolition of
the Committee for Information in 1951, It encompassed the
absorption into the Second Chief Directorate of the duties of
the former Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Directorates. which had
been responsible for political, econonic-industrial, and
transportation security, respectively, It also included the
upgrading of the Illegals Department to the status of a
Special Directorate within the First Chief Directorate, the
consolddation of counterintelligence operations abroad into
one new department, the Fourteenth, and creation of a new
department--Department "D" (Disinformation) --ta coordinate
and intensify the KGB's activities in the area of deception
and misinformation. The lattcr, although placed in the First
Chief Directorate, was established to serve the needs of the
entire KGB.

NOSENKO's 1964 information on the organizetion and func-
tions of the KGB indicated refinements of responsibilities
in the Second Chief Directorate in accordance with the 1959
absorption of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Directorates.
The formation of the so-called "Service" (Sluzhba) as a
component of the Second Chief Directorate Centralized those
political security functions (formerly handled by the Fourth
Directorate) which were unrelated to foreigners in the USSR;
the creation of an element entitled "the Directorate" (Uprev-
leniye}) accumplished the same thing for industrial-dcondmle

Tunctions formerly managed by the Fifth and Sixth Directorates.

As for the First Chief Directorate, NOSENKO reported the up-
grading of the Scientific and Technical Department to direc-
torate status, and the expansion of the Information and
Counterintelligence Departmentsto UService: Number’:1" and "Ser-
vice Number 2," respectively; according to NOSENKO, the

latter organizational designation permits an increase in
personnel without a corresponding rise in the bureaucratic
level of the component.

The accompanying charts offer a comparison of the or-~
ganization of the KGB in 1961, as known from GOLITSYN (and
supported by GOLENIEWSKI), and in 1964, as given by NOSENKO,.
Comments on particular weaknesses in NOSENKO'’s information
on the KGB organization since its formation in 1954 will be
found in Part VII.B.1., Statements of _DERYABIN. :

VI. Production — oe :

NOSENKO's positive intelligence production has been
meager, and nothinghe reported serited dissemination a3 an
intelligence report. According to his biography, NOSENKO fs
entire adult life until defecting ad been spent either as . _ 4
& student or as an intelligence o/ficer, and in explanatios
of his lack of positive intelligence information, he has : i
stressed that since the early 1950's he had few outside - :
interests and "no real contacts" outside the KGB itself.* :
NCOSENKO's assignments to the Soviet delegations to the : ,
Disarmament Conference in 1962 and 1964 were, he hes said,
for cover purposes only. and he aeither had any connections
with officials or organizations in the USSR concerned with
arms control or disarmament policies nor did he take any
part in the substantive work of the delegations. 1

A. Pesitive Intetligence Inforaation . j
gn cre :
{

 

During the period 18 to 23 February 1964, a wide range
of questions covering various aspects of nuclear weapons,

missiles, electrunics, communications, unconventional wea~

pons, military industry, military units and equipment, and
repearch and devolopment wero put to FOSENKO in order to
evaluate his knowledgeability. He had no direct knowledge

of any of these topics, although he was able to idestify in
general a few of the KGB organizations which protect sensi-
tive installations such as nuclear weapons production and
storage sites. NOSENKO was given a set of requirements

from the Defense Intelligence Agency on 24 February 1964.
These questions were premiscd on his two TDY tours to the
Disarmament Conferences in Geneva; they dealt with such
matters as Soviet underground testing, Soviet efforts and
progress in the fields of chemical and biological warfare,
Soviet aims and purposes at ‘the disarmament talks, and

Soviet views of the corresponding attitudes and intentions

of the United States. NOSENKO stated he had uo information
on any of these questions but expressed his personal opinion
on a.few of them, in general terms. NOSENKO's answers to
other questions of a positive intelligence nature--those
concerning the viability of the current Soviet leadership. {
plans for a new Soviet constitution, anti-Semitism as .

‘governmental policy, personality data on Soviet leaders,

and other political and social matters--were couche
and general terms and were not based on concrete knowledge.

 

 

*At the start of his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962,
however, when explaining how he knew of the real state of

affairs inside the USSR (as opposed to that presented by

Soviet propaganda), NOSENKO said: “I circulate among

ministers, with the friends of my father, and I hear :
what they say."
