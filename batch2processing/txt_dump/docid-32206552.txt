a letter of reference in our files, dated May 1, 1938, from
MAISON SIGURD, Antwerp, Belgium, which indicates that Mr.

VON MOHRENSCHILDT had been employed as a correspondent and
bookkeeper by that firm from the time of its founding

(no date given) to 1933, and that he had managed its commercial
department from the latter date until March 1938 when he Left

knowledge of him. His former direct supervisor is deceased.

"T first met GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT in about 1930 here in
New York City. He had recently arrived from Belgium, where
he had been educated. For a short period of time during
the last 1930's or early 1940's, I employed him as a salesman
for this company, selling decorative fabrics. He was not
too sudcessful at this type of work, and involved selling.

. There was nothing unfavorable connected with his leaving
his position, and he would be eligible for rehire. We have
no records pertaining to his employment whatsoever and there
is no one employed here who would possibly have any personal
knowledge of him. It is my impression that, shortly afterwards,

he went to work for the Humble 0i1 Company, working as a
field worker. He also went, to Venezuela, working for
some oil company there. I never heard of Chevalier (or
Chevalier Garde), and am not familiar with any possible

worked for many years in Colorado and Texas in that field. -
I would see him only intermittently over these many years.
Although he considers me a close friend, I do mot consider
that Iam an imtimate associate of his. I was his best

man when he married Miss WINNE SHARPLES in about the early
1950's. Recently, she divorced him, in Texas, I believe.
Previously, he had been married to and divorced from |

“FIFI WASHINGTON'; I believe they resided and were divorced
in Colorado. Prior to that marriage, I believe he had been
married to a ‘DORIS' in New York; I do not know how that
marriage severed or where. I:do not know whether he had any
children of either of his first to marriages, but I am the
Godfather to his son, one of his two children of his last
marriage. From everything that GEORGE ever told me, I would
judge that he is still on good terms with his former wives
aud his in-laws. I do not know where any of his former
wives are except the last, who is now Mrs. ROBERT DENTON and
resides outside the state. No question has ever come up
about him which would reflect unfavorably upon him with
respect to honesty, integrity, moral character, use of
intoxicants, or physical or mental health. As

far as I know, none of his matrimonial difficulties would
reflect unfavorably upon him with respect to character,
loyalty, or associations.

the University of Texas, became a geological engimeer, and . ees

 

 

“At present, he is in Yugoslavia on a mission to locate oil
for TITO, sent by the United States Government, he told me
that before he left here some months ago. I also received
some mail from him, in which he told me he was in Coratia.

 

"EF have no knowledge of his activities during World War II,
because I was away. He had no connection with me. I have
mo reason to question his loyalty to the United States. I ;
do mot believe that he is sympathetic to communism, '
Fascism or any subversive ideology. He has never indicated :

by the company was ‘non-production.' His contract was
terminated by a ‘seven day notice' from the company to him
of the company's intention to terminate and the reason
thereforth. His production record indicates that he sold
no insurance whatsoever during the entire period of his
contract. .

 

"He resided at 13 Hast 67th Street, New York, N. Y., and

gave his marital status as "single.' His date of birth is
given as April 17, 1911; his place of birth is not shown,
although his nationality is given as 'Russian.' His last
previous employment, as indicated by him at commencement

of his agency contract, was as a Salesman for Chevalier Garde
Inc. from August to December, 1939; reason for leaving - to
enter insurance. Prior to that, he indicated that he was

a salesman for Humble Oil from June to August, 1939; reason
for leaving - return to New York. Prior to that, he was
employed as Manager for Sigurd from October, 1933, to May,
1939. There is no indication of the location of said previous
employments on the card. More detailed records, including
his contract file, have been destroyed. There is nothing in
the record which would reflect unfavorably upon him with
respect to character, loyalty or associations. There is no
one employed here now who would have any personal knowledge
of Mr. VON MOHRENSCHILDT.

 

"WENZLOFF AGENCY, 120 Broadway. Record furnished by DOROTHY
MAC WHINNEY, Secretary.

"This agency was formerly the L. A. Miner Agency of the

Equitable Life Assurance Society, to which GEORGE VON MOHRENSCHILDT
was assigned during the entire period of his agency contract.

Mr. MINER and I were employed here then, but we have no
recollection of Mr. VON MOHRENSCHILDT. In November, 1940,

his agency contract was cancelled, upon our recommendation, 4
for lack of business as a matter of policy. ._ Cancellation of o,
such a contract should not reflect unfavorably upon Mr.

VON MOHRENSCHILDT; I am sure such a contract would be renewed
at any time, provided he could obtain the necessary insurance
business. The records indicate that his address was changed
from 13 East 67th Street to 109 East 73rd Street, both at

changed our methods of operation and dissolved the committee.
We did not feel that he had misappropriated any fund or had
been dishonest, and there were no accusations or intimations
of such a nature. He knew it was his responsibility to
control and account for expenditures, but he was extreme ly
lax on that score. GEORGE understood exactly why his services
were being terminated and why the committee was being
dissolved and its operations reorganized. As far as I am .
concerned, he would be eligible for rehire for any position
for which he was qualified with respect to geology or
petroleum engineering. No question ever arose concerning him
with respect to character, morals, honesty, sobriety,

loyalty to the United States, or organizational connections,
or associations. I can recommend him for a position critical
from the standpoint of the national security.

"EDWARD GORDON HOOKER, Oil Financier, One East 57th Street,
Residing at 830 Park Avenue. (Reference).

"My mother, Mrs. WINIFRED CARTWRIGHT HOOKER, who resides at
the Hotel Palais D'’Orsay, Paris; France, was married formerly
to DMITRI VON MOHRENSCHILDT (GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT'’s brother),
who is a professor at Dartmouth College. I believe I

first met GEORGE, when my mother and I went to visit his
brother, in Belgium in about the summer of 1936. I

_Was just a young boy at the time, and I do not recall what
GEORGE's activities in Europe were at the time or where he
might actually have been residing.. I next saw him after

his arrival in the United States in about 1938 or 1939 when
he came to visit his brother, DMITRI, who, by that time, was
glready my step-father. Between 1938 and 1943, I resided

at 950 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. with my parents; my

‘brother, sister, and grandmother were other occupants in

.° our apartment there. It is my impression that GEORGE never
.. actually resided at that address, in our apartment or in

any other for that matter. I know that he did use our

address as a mailing address, and recail that he may have

stayed over for a night or week ends or so, but he kept no

clothing there. I was away at college during much of the

period of my residence at 950 Park Avenue, but I came in

frequently on holidays and vacation periods, and I am

sure that I would recall if he lived in our apartment.

I recall that he did have an apartment for some short period

of time around that time somewhere on the "Eastside’ of

Manhattan (New York, N.Y.), but it is also my impression that

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

WFO 100-1689

contrast with the allegedly poor treatment that the Poles
had given his father. I do not recall ever hearing that he
might have associated with any Nazis either. I have no
reason to believe that he is or ever has been sympathetic
to communism or the Soviet Union. Despite his expressed
sympathy for Germany during World War II, I would have no
question about his loyalty to the United States. I do not
know of any organizations to which he might ever have belonged.
There are three people who have known him for many years,
and who I feel have been close social associates of his:
They are Mrs. CHARLES DUNCAN MILLER, PIERRE FREYSS, and
BAILEY BALKEN, The latter is in the oil business, also

in our Southwest.

 

 

"Nothing has ever come to my attention about him which would
involve any possible immorality, intemperance or dishonesty.
I believe that he is normal mentally and physically. I
cannot, however, recommend him for a responsible position
involving our national security because of his ‘inability
to respect confidences,’ I can cite at least two incidents:
Om one occasion, after I had indicated to him my reasons for
disapproving of his proposed wife, he went and told her all .
about what I had said about her; on the other occasion, when gear:
I was just a young man, after I had pledged abstinence from
liquor and had violated that pledge, GEORGE told my mother ee
about it. I feel, therefore, that he has a tendency to
violate personal confidences when he knows full well that
these are personal confidences. Although this might be
attributed to tactlessness or naivete, I believe that he
cannot be trusted implicitly with any type of secrets, let
alone government secrets.

 

"STALEY TREGELLAS, Oil Developer, One East 57th Street.

 

"I first met GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT in Dallas, Texas, in
about 1951, just about the time when his partnership with
ED HOOKER had been dissolved. I visited GEORGE's residence
there, where he lived with DIDI SHARPLES. I understand that
they have been divorced. I have seen him only occasionally
since that time, whenever he visited New York. I have
shared office space with his former partner, ED HOOKER,
here at this address; we are not friends, and our contact
