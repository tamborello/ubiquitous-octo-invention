"4, Attack on mother ship or exile raiders on the

COMMENT It is noted that it is contrary to national
policy to permit raids on Cuba originating from
U.S, territory, however, at the time a ship or
aircraft is discovered to be under Cuban attack
it may be difficult to identify it as a "pirate?!
"raider", "mother ship" or “exile raider", even
though this, in fact, may be the case. All the
situations, set forth above, are covered, at
least in part, by the rules of engagement which
have been approved by the highest national
authority. However, the action summarized below
