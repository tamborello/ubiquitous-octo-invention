3. According to LIFEAT, when Subject called TUCHKIN (suspect
GRU) on & April) 1966, he asked If LECKGY was In Mexico. (Wikoloy
Sergeyevich LEQNOY, 2612132139, Is Press attache in Mexico and
known KGS ofticer.,) On S April 196d Subject called ang spoke co
LEOMGV's wife. Subject said he would Tike to visit @ longs rate
In Mexico. LEGHOYA sald ta give thelr reyards to Tanara POPOVA
(presuasiriy ths wife or alexsey Yakovievich POPOV, 208-13 Pluk,
Soviet Counsefior In Ottaws}, LIFEAT Indicates that LEGHUY set
Subject's plans and was with Subject until) 0159 on 27 aprik 1966,
LIERVOY also reports that Subject tried to contact LEONOV on
ad April 1966.

4, According to LIFEAT Subject tried to contact TUCHIIN
the morning after his arrival to let him know be had arrived.
TUCHA TH wag out and expected howe at 1400 hours. Subject called
back that efterecon, said he had been slyntseetng around Maxlvo
City until E460 hours. TUCHAINGs wife sald that TUCHNER would
prover:ty be tled up all afterooon at the Embassy. Suoject sald
TVCHNIK and LEGNOV ware the only people he wanted to see In Maxics,

fee Subject told TUCHNIMA that he hed nad @ yey tlae In Chile,
He and (Vitaliy feanovich) CuBYSH (2G1e7%£365) ans (frud POLTAKUY
had stayed In the saw hotel, He dla nat know whether KROBSYSH
would stsy In Chile or not.

. 6. Subject also told TUCHUIMA thet he had two names and
eddrasses of pecple In Maxico who spoke Engtish, since he spoke
wo Spanish, bat ba seemed reluctant to foo. thes up wlthout naving
someon: along who coukd ac least speak Seanish to the taxt driver,
Gae of ths men was (fone) FLORES, whom Subject belleved to be 4
unlversatcy professor, (CGHRENT: Possioly itoracio FLOFES de is
Pena, leftist Clrector of the School of Economics et UA}.

 
 

7. Apparently TUCHHIN was unable to ses Subject mth) tne
afterroon of 25 April i865. TUCHgin sald he had been sure LEu
would (ake care af Subject, but Subject seemed sommwhat put out
over TUCHHIM's neglect. Subject wanted to borrow TUCHHIN's
Canera to take scae pictures"of the historical stgnts,™ and
TUCte it agreed to meet him that afternoon, (Sources LIFEAT).
