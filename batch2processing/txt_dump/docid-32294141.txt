and gathering information,

Italians would use their diplomatic pouch to
Washington for Embassy ‘relay to Senate sub-
committee which in turn might use Department
pouch to Embassy Rome for forwarding.

"3, To make initial contact between.
two groups, Italians would use either letter
direct to Mr. Adlerman or send restricted group
to Washington for talks.: -In latter connection, '
Cosentino raised this question: Italian group, —
reflecting overall. membership Parliament, con-
tains Communist legislators. What ‘would be U.S.

_ attitude, particularly re visa issuance, if one
Communist among, say, three-man delegation?
(Appeared in context conversation that Communist
would probably be Senator Girolamo LiCausi,
longtime party leader in Sicily, and vice~

-. president of Mafia Commission) .

. "Embassy Officer.said. would report con-
versation. Re possible Communist member dele-
gation, he limited reply to noting: provision
‘U.S. immigration laws for waiver, which depended
on facts each-case. Further instructions this
‘point :would be appreciated. (Embassy Comment:
One way to avoid immediate, confrontation this
problem.could be for Senate subcommittee to send
members ‘or representatives here for talks with
Italian counterparts). "

On October 28, 1963, the Italian Police advised
that they have still been unable to locate NICOLO GENTILE.
in. this regard it is. to be noted that on October 26, 1963,
Mr. MICHAEL G. -PICINI, U. S. Narcotics Bureau representa-
tive, American Embassy; Rome, advised that his office :
was also attempting, to locate GENTILE for interview. '

 

Rome. is following this matter closely.and
pertinent information developed will be promptly reported.
