BRODKIN that his brother, "POPS" had become an alcoholic.

"PEANUTS" then complained concerning the way
the "G has been throwing the heat on" in Chicago since
his return from the State Penitentiary in Tennessee. He
complained that times have changed in this regard in
Chicago. :

PANCZKO then advised that his nephew had become
a dope addict and mentioned that he had called the "pusher"
and in a very rough way instructed him to lay off selling
the stuff to his nephew. ;

. PANCZKO then discussed the fact that he had been ~
brutally beaten by Warden GARFIELD (ph) at Ripley,State Pen,
Tennessee, and that when histsister visited him, she could
see the signs of his beating on him. She therefore
returned to Chicago where apparently she contacted BROBKIN
who instructed her to contact the FBI, PANCZKO then
described how he was contacted and interviewed at Ripley
by FBI agents who took a signed statement from him showing
the violation of his civil rights. PANCZKO indicated that
he was never thereafter again beaten,

. , The conversation then(changed to an associate of ZS ,
PANCZKO, Chicago Top deme Thiet; Hemaus... BRODKIN = ws
commented “that he feels tha A is a pigeon for that
lieutenant, ENGERS.”

In speaking of "“stooh pigeons," BRG@DKIN mentioned

that Someone told nim that “cAntyRLORTD, former Chicago Top
Jewel Thief, was a stool pigeon, but BRODKIN contended that

this was not true, and that FIORITO was a real "stand up LL,
guy" and that BRODKIN would do anything for CARL.

In continuing this line of conversation, BRODKIN
and PANCZKO then discussed one "CHESTER" who "was a real
tough guy to get along with." This undoubtedly is a °
reference to former Chicago Top Jewel Thief CHESTER GRAY,
who for some time was an informant of the Chicago Office.
