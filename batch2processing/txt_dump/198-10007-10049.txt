other routes, the great majority passed through Mexico.
On the most conservative basis, then, it will be séen 7
‘that there cannot have been fewer than 4,912:travellers.-

perhaps as many as 2,000,have received ideological.
indoctrination or guerrilla warfare training. . Many"

: of these are still in Cuba. Others have returned to
, their homelands; some by legal means; some probably
“py illicit means, There is no. reason to presume, -
moreover, that. the travel to Cuba of the remaining
3,000-3,500 was entirely consistent with the best
interesta of the hemisphere,

Prior to the October crisis, Latin Americans
travelling to Cuba usually moved by regular commercial:
airlines or, on occasion, by specially chartered. =:
Cubana flights, Some travelled to Trinidad or
“Curacao and thence by regularly scheduled. Cubana or:
KIM flights to Havana. Others travelled to Mexico, .. i;
and from there by Mexicana or Cubana commercial gets
flights. to Havana, With the cessation.of service
to Cuba by Pan American, KIM, Mexicana, and Tbheria’
airlines in October, the regular Cubana service.
between Mexico City and Havana remained the sole,
direct. and regular airline connection between. Cuba.
and the remainder ‘of Latin America, - :

 
 
    
 
  
   
  
  
  
 
 
  

 

The Qubana service between.Havana and Mexico. is”
scheduled to operate twice weekly, but sometimes only.
a single flight is completed per week. Aircraft now’
employed are British Britannias - an obsolescent: ‘model.
Cubana has requested, but has not yet received,
Mexican approval to substitute Soviet IL-18 transports
‘for the old Britannias., Delay by the Mexicans in >
granting this approval can have the favorable effect. -
of impeding travel, as the Britannias are-now in
‘poor condition, If, in addition, the British and’
“Canadians can be induced to suspend delivery of ao
spare parts, the planes will soon become inoperative, °

: ‘Iberia airlines resumed its regular twice-monthly. ™..-”
flights from Madrid to Havana on 11 February. This ~
flight makes one stop, in the Azores, before reaching
Havana, wo

KIM has not yet resumed its regular flights to cuba
from the Netherlands Antilles, However, it is now. con-
sidering doing so. In this regard it is concluded. that:
resumption of scheduled. flights by a United: States oe
earrier could serve as an encouragement to KIM and.
others to do the same. .

On. the other hand, this same geographic situation
makes clandestine entry and exit reasonably simple.
There are 3,825 linear miles of essentially unpa-
trolled Central American coastline, within 175 to
850 miles from Cuba, There are at least .93 airfields,
other than ours, within 700 miles of the island, and

‘Even in the face of these unfavorable factors, a
program of direct restraints, selected from among
the actions enumerated herein, can have favorable —

Ii, Nature and Scope of the Problem

We do not know enough about ‘the movement of . os
subversive trainees, into Cuba and - more important - eo
out of Cuba, We do not know enough about thé. voltime ~. =:
of travel, or the media employed. This is par- :
ticularly true in the area of illicit traffic, where
our knowledge is extremely limited.

CUBA
THE MOVEMENT OF SUBVERSIVES AND SUBVERSIVE TRAINEES

OT, Introduction

 

: The ‘actions proposed herein are: designed to “impede pes
the flow of subversives between Cuba and other Latin °:"
American countries. Execution of any one: or more of... |
the enumerated actions will ameliorate the situation; »
execution of them all will not completely solve it. -
The practical problems involved. are too numerous and
complex. vrs

  

 

With respect. to diminishing legal travel to Guba,
we face multiple problems in the policies and attitudes
. of those Latin American countries through which ‘the.

subversive traveller must pass. From.the viewpoint of'.
these nations the direct actions required have strong: :
- political and sometimes legal implications. -impli- ..
“cations which cannot be overcome easily,. even when:
_ the leaders of these countries choose to do BOe 8 os

 

In the matter of clandestine travel, we are: .
confronted not only with the great depth of communist .
guile, born of two generations of experience. in the
international movement of subversives, but with the
inexperience, ineptitude and lack of awareness in .
these same matters on the part of the Latin American.
‘ community... ae

 

In spite of this, the advantages do hot all reside. :
with the communists. Cuba's insular character imposes
certain sharp limitations upon personal movement. :
Cuba’ has no frontiers with other states; everyone
who enters the country must do so either by water,
or‘air. There can be no slipping through the .
barbed wire.
