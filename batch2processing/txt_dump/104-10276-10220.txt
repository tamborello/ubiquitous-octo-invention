Lawron, Havana, Cuba

Telephone: 99-42-82
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY: It ts difficult to dichotomize Subject's intelligence
and non- intelligence activities, since he obviously utilizes his overt position as
a Cuban diplomat to cover his clandestine activity, The narrative that follows
describes the total extent of his "known" act ivity with indicattons of covert

modus operandi where appropriate,

a, Subject was reportedly in charge of Security in the Cuban Embassy in
Mexico, The record reflects at least one case where Subject had one of
his fellow employees under surveillance, (June 1962) i

b, Subject was administering locally the “trainee program" of Latin American
youths going to Cuba, The record has confirmed cases where the Mexico
City Office of Prensa Latina, and specifically Edmundo JARDON Arzate,
201-163987, steers the prospective trainees to Subject, Subject calls them
to the Embassy where applications are filled out and these in turn are sent
to Havana for vetting, The reply from‘Havana normally takes 15 days,

(1963-64) :

The Station also has on record confirmed cases where the Guatemalan
Communist, Victor Manuel GUTIERREZ, 201-68248, using the alias,
Dr. ALVAREZ, in contacting Subject has participated In channeling of
recruits, especially Central Americans, to VEGA, (1963-64)

d, The activities described above merge nicely with Subject’s overt activity
of issuing courresyvisas and taking care of persons invited to visit Cuba
AS part of the Cuban Government's friendship program, In the case of
