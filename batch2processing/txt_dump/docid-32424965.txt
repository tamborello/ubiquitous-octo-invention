THIS IS A WARNING MESSAGE.

   

L. The President of the United States has under
consideration the initiation-of blockade operations

against Cuba.

 

2. The reaction to these operations by Cuban military
‘fopees could lead to U.S..air strikes against Cuban armed
forces, and invasion ofthe island of Cuba. Preparations

for these con -tingencies are in progress. These sub-

sequent actions, it initiated, would probably result in

    
 

the use of force ageinst Sov viet military and civilian

     

personnel in Cuba and would directly challenge the

      

prestige of the Soviet Unicon. The reaction of the USSR

   

cannot be predicted with accuracy.

   

3. It is imperative under the circumstances which

   
   

. could arise to present the strongest possible deterrent

      

to any course of Soviet military action. The U.S.

        

/ must demonstrate unequivocally that it is ready

  

     

+ militarily to meet énd to defeat retaliatory Soviet

   

actions at whatever level is necessary. At the same

   

sime, we must avoid actions in other areas which may

    
 

be consideved provocative or which may create civil

   

‘alarm.
