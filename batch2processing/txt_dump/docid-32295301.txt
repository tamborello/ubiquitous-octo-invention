My

, NO 1457-C-TE advised that CARLOS MARCELLO's wifé !
JACKIE recently imposed an 8:00 p.m. curfew on CARLOS i
MARCELLO when he is in New Orleans. JACKIE MARCELLO has
-become highly incensed over CARLOS MARCELLO's long time
affair with LUCILLE, the beautician. JACKIE MARCELLO has
never before become upset with any of MARCELLO's other female
companions but his association with LUCILLE has really upset
JACKIE MARCELLO. : 4

 

. Approximately two and one-half weeks ago, the Uy
first night of the curfew, CARLOS arrived home one-half houf eer"
“ate. CARLOS MARCELLO's daughter was swimming in their pool
with several of her girl friends, including two overnight
guests. JACKIE MARCELLO would not let CARLOS in, and
several moments later ordered all the girls into the house
but barred the door to CARLOS MARCELLO.

 

 

 

CARLOS MARCELLO became enraged and obtained a . |
sledgehammer from the garage with the intention of breaking '
down the door. JACKIE MARCELLO took a shotgun and pointed
‘it out a second story window and ordered CARLOS off the
property. JACKIE told CARLOS to come back the next day or

whenever he felt he could stick to the curfew. Since that
incident, CARLOS has been sticking to the curfew and when in
New. Orleans, is only out after 8:00 p.m. when accompanied
by his wife. ‘
