62-HQ-109060

For the information FBIHQ, in Boston teletype to
the Director, dated January 28, 1992, captioned JOHN F.
KENNEDY Assassination (Bureau File Number 62~-109060), the
Boston Division informed the Bureau that it was unable to
locate Boston file 62-3861. This file has now been located and
pursuant to the instructions received from SSA GRANT HARMON,
FBIHQ, the three original serials contained in this file are
being forwarded to the Bureau as enclosures to this airtel.

For the further information of the Bureau, the
Boston Division has conducted five searches for Boston file
175-112. This file is entitled "Assassination of President
JOHN F. KENNEDY". According to Boston teletype to the Director
dated January 28, 1992, Boston file 175-112 was characterized
as follows: "This file does not reflect any investigation at
Boston. It is a repository for correspondents and public
record information regarding the. assassination." The Boston
Division obviously reviewed this file shortly before
submitting the above mentioned teletype to FBIHQ. Since that
time five separate searches have been conducted attempting to
locate it so it could be sent to the Task Force at FBIHQ.
These searches have proved negative and the most recent one
was conducted by MDE MARGARET MUNROE on June 14, 1994. This
search included checking all logical places where the file
could be located including closed files, all Squad Rotors, the
Informant Room, the SAC and ASAC’s offices but the search
proved negative as it has so many times in the past. Boston
file 175-112 is listed on the Boston missing file list.

Boston teletype to the Director dated January 28,
1992 also mentioned that Boston file 157-55 also pertained to
JOHN F. KENNEDY but was unable to be located. Since that time
there have been at least two additional attempts to locate
157-55 with negative results. The most recent attempt to
locate 157-55 occurred on June 14, 1994 and the search was
conducted by MDE MARGARET MUNROE. This search included all of
the places mentioned above for the search for Boston file 175-
112. Boston file 157-55 is also on the Boston missing file
list.

On June 14, 1994 the Boston Division conducted a
FOIMS check on the following subjects:

1. JOHN F. KENNEDY Assassination
2. JFK Assassination

3. Assassination of President John F. Kennedy

Records Collection Act of 1992

5. JFKARCA

These FOIMS Indices checks located no additional
records concerning captioned matter. These FOIMS checks
disclosed information contained in Boston File 62-HQ-109060
which is the Boston Division Control File pertaining to
captioned matter.

PLA Boston also checked to see whether the Boston
Division had any files pertaining to "89A-DL-60165" and this
check proved negative.

On June 15, 1994 SSA GRANT HARMON contacted PLA
Boston and requested that a search be conducted for Boston
File 52-8794. SSA HARMON advised that this file was captioned
"UNSUB POSSIBLE THEFT OF JOHN F. KENNEDY AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS".
MDE MARGARET MUNROE and Closed File Clerk ROBERT EMERSON made
an effort to locate this file with negative results. They
determined based upon the date other files around this file
were opened that the file probably was opened around 1985. MDE
MUNROE checked the FOIMS Index in an effort to assist in
locating the file but it was not indexed into FOIMS. Neither
was the file on any file destruction list. MDE MUNROE then
conducted the same type of search for 52-8794 that she
conducted regarding the other missing files and this search
proved negative. PLA Boston does not know where this file is
located.

Boston PLA JOHN MICHAEL CALLAHAN; Jr. coordinated
the Boston Division efforts regarding captioned matter. The

actual file searches and various indices searches were
conducted by various support personnel in the Boston Division.
