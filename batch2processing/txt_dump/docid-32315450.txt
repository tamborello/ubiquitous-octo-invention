informant stated that he would be well pleased
if the police department was able to convict and send
TONY GIACALONE to prison but he says he will wait and
see what happens. He said GIACALONE had become very big
in Sicilian gambling circles since 12 or 14 years ago he was
peddling the daily racing forms in prison to various bookmakers .
including himself. He further stated he wondered if the oe
case would hold up in court for conviction since he read
the newspaper he did not observe any information that
Detroit Police Officer THOMAS had ever met GIACALONE in person.
