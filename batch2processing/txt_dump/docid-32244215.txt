Bolden told the writers that he made notes of some of
_the things that he uncovered in connection with the events
of October 30 - November 2, 1963, but that when he was
arrested in 1964, this notebook was ‘seized’ by ‘the government
(Secret Service). He said that he would have no ) objection -
to testifying in washington under oath relating to the .

matters which he discussed with us in this: interview.

where he believes an SS employee met the flight and delivered
the material to Headquarters. The two suspects in Chicago
were turned over to the Chicago Police who took them away

in a patrol wagon. He recalls that at least one of the two
had a Spanish~sounding name.

Bolden recalls Tom Mosely's name mentioned in the office
around that period (Nov 1963). He said when Agent Tom Kelley
arrived in Chicago from Dallas on or about 11/26/63, he men-
tioned a John Heard or Hurt. They searched the office card
files for a similar sounding name. He. also recalls that. he
and Conrad Cross were sent to check out a mixed Black-
Spanish neighborhood on Rockwell Street to determine where
a certain person who resided there was on 11/22/63. They
were unable to locate the person, who:.had’ moved; and
Bolden could not recall the subject's name. The PRS had
a record of the person from a previous threat. Bolden
was critical of the activities of PRS, saying they did not
do a thorough job. He did not further elaborate.

‘Bolden, whose 43rd birthday coincided with our interview,
was accompanied by his wife, Barbara. He told the writers
that he is now working for the National Lead Company, 1800
S. Peoria Street, Chicago, as night supervisor in quality
control. He is also a minister in the Islamic Faith and

teaches a course in religion in Chicago.

and shirt with open collar. His hair was dark and he had

a crew cut which is described as " Detroit style." The writers
showed Bolden our Committee "mug" book containing 1 through 71
and 73-81, and he stated that the facial structure of photo

#74 was similar to that of the subject being questioned by
agents in the office. Picture #74 is listed as "unidentified -
possibly Jim Braden." It is directly underneath Thomas Vallee's
picture in the mug book. Vallee, #76, was not recognized by
Bolden at all, although he was familiar with the case.which
was described in the article written by Edwin Black in the
Chicago Independent, a now-defunct publication, dated November
1975. On page ten of this article entitled "The Plot to Kill
JFK in Chicago, November 2, 1963 - Twenty Days Before Dallas,"
the writer is checking all arrests in the city of Chicago. He

says: "Then we checked every arrest in the entire city on those

‘days. Who arrested them? Why? Any weapons? It took weeks.

In the process, we'd develop leads: Look for Cuban names. Look
for the name 'Bradley.' Look for the name 'Braden.' Nothing
came of it." .(underscoring ours).

Bolden recalis that one of the. two men had a.Spanish-
sounding name. He said.the SS agents took their pictures
with a Polaroid camera. The agents' notes. were typed up and
the memos were then taken to O'Hare Airport and given to a

crew member (pilot?) of a commercial flight to Washington.

There were only about 13 agents in the Chicago SS
office at the time and the substance of the teletype and
the telephone call alleging a threat against the life of
the President on an upcoming trip (2 Nov) to Chicago was
quickly disseminated.

Surveillance was undertaken by the agents on two of
the four subjects identified with the threat. Because
Bolden was black, he and another black agent, Conrad Cross,
were excluded from the "north side" Chicago surveillance
because it was a predominantly white neighborgood. _ Through

a series of blunders, the surveillance was "blown" by
Lloyd.

Agent Jay Lawrence Stocks and the two subjects were appre-

hended and brought in to the Chicago SS office. Bolden's
awareness of the progress of this surveillance came partly
from office gossip and partly from his monitoring the Ss
radio channels in his car. In any event, he said Agent
Stocks was subject of some earthy comments from his fellow
agents. .

Bolden recalls that James Rowley called from Washington
and suggested that Martineau use a COS file number.
Bolden explained that a CO (for Central Office) number was
issued only in or from Washington Headquarters and an "Ss"
for Secret or Sensitive was given when they wanted to seques-

ter information contained in the file. He explained that

DocId: 322442915 Page 5
Interview/A.W. Bolden/1-19-78
Page Four

these files were kept separate from all others and that

SS could say they had nothing in their files on a subject
when in fact a "COS" file existed. He said as far as he
knew, these were never destroyed. (underscoring ours).

In addition to the cos file number, Bolden said that all
agents who were involved in this surveillance activity

were told by ATSAIC Martineau to turn in their notebooks.
All memos were typed, he told us, .by a Charlotte Klapkowski
(sp?) who is now working at Headquarters in Washington and
is close to retirement age. "Now don't expect her to tell
you anything. She is very loyal to the Service and wouldn't
say anything she thought would hurt them in any way," he
told us. The memo copies were all sequestered by Charlotte
on this surveillance. .

Bolden recalls that in addition to Stocks, Agents
Strong, Motto and Noonan were involved in the apprehension
of the two men. On Saturday morning, November 2, Bolden
was in the office early. He recalls that the interrogation
rooms were littered with cigarette butts and coffee cups,
evidence of a night-long interrogation. He saw only one
of the two men they had apprehended. He describes this man
as swarthy, stocky, "a truck driver type." is the way he

described him. The man was 5'9".or 5'10", wearing a jacket

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

NAME Abraham Wendell Bolden _ Date 1-19-78 Time

“Address 7632 S. Sangamon St. Place Mid City Holiday Inn
: .  §S. Holstead & Madison Sts.
Chicaco, Illinois Chicago, T1l. er Lo
_ Interview? ,

  

“on 1/19/78 "the writers “interviewed Mr. “Bolden at the <~
Mid. City Holiday Inn, Chicago, Illinois. Bolden had. been a
Secret Service Agent | in 1963, stationed: in Chicago and’ it was

believed’ that he could furnish information relative to. a con~

_spiracy ‘to assassinate President ‘John F. Kennedy in Chicago”

on. 2 November, 1963.

A brief background on Abraham Bolden is necessary to

7

understanding our need to talk to him at this time: “He was

: out. of East St. Louis, Illinois and joined the Secret Service

‘in 1959 (Eisenhower was President). He worked counterfeit
cases in Chicago and in the summer of 1961 he was assigned
_to the White House Detail. “He was the first negro agent
assigned to this detail. Bolden spent only three’ months

in this detail and was evidently shocked at. what ‘he ‘saw.

He complained to his supervisor, Harvey Henderson, and ‘to
James ‘Rowley, then head of Secret Service about ‘the’ general 7
laxity and the heavy drinking among. the agents who were as-_
signed to protect the President. He also resented the slurs *

“against blacks which: were called to his attention from time.

to time, eg., the separate housing facilities for black
agents on southern trips. He was transferred back to
Chicago.

While attending a refresher course in Washington in
mid-May, 1964, Bolden was returned to Chicago on a subter-
fuge and subsequently arrested and charged with soliciting
a bribe, obstruction of justice and conspiracy in an alleged
attempt to sell SS file information to a Chicago counterfeiter.
His first trial, in July 1964, resulted in a mistrial; his
second trial, a month later, in a conviction. “He was sen-
tenced to serve six years. He appealed and in June, 1966,
the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

The writers found Bolden not at all bitter about the
.1964 case although we did not dwell on it. We questioned
him about the events which allegedly took place in Chicago
just prior to and on 2 November 1963.

Bolden told us that around October 30, 1963, he recalled
a long teletype message coming in to the Chicago office from
the FBI. It was unusual, he told us, for the FBI to cooperate
on any cases with the SS. But Mary Cooney, a clerical person
working in the office at the time, and now believed to be
deceased, took this message to the ARSAIC, Maurice Martineau.
Prior to the telex, there was a phone call from the FBI.
Bolden doesn't know if it was local FBI (Chicago) or Washington

Hdq. calling.
