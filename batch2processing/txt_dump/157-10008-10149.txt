TL believe SGUARE DANCE deserves our at-ention. If assassination
is unacceptable, surely too is the widespre:d destruction of Plont:
and animal life through covert germ warfare re) Somehow (probably through
hesrings ond restrictive legislation) the Ci ngress must drive home the
point that there are iegal and moral limits to American foreign policy.
These Limits may not be easy Lo define, but we must try.

 

 

On the third psge of the second atiacnment (a "Memorandum for
ssion of Covert Program Against Cuba" vritten by Bundy) reference
is made to "possible addition of contaminating elements to sensitive
Cuban imports (not food)." The cover memy 1rom Gordon Chase (NSC
staffer) indicates that this proposal received Presidential backing.
