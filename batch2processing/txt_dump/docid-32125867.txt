RE: HOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES |
. KLAN INVESTIGATIONS

The source further advised that “Robert “Scoggin aS, ‘Grand Diagon
for the State of: South Carolina, had been notified by the Veterans
Administration that his disability pension has been reduced, Shelton
feels that this was a setallatory measure taken by the Committee and the
Veterans Administration against Scoggins, Therefore, :the Klan is
lddging a protest with the American Legion and the Disabled American
Veterans, Shelton: stated that when Raymond Ander son, the Grand Dragon
for the State of Tentiessee, appears to testify before the Committee,
Sheiton and members of the press would accompany Anderson to the Veterans.
Administration to inquire iz Anderson? s disability | pension will’ also be.
reduced,: =

, It is noted that Anderson is a Bureau informant, who while
Serving in the Armed Forces.during “the Korean Conflict. lost his Aeft
‘arm, | This loss: entitled. him to a disability pension. Fa

Observations:

: ' Chairman Willis. is being contacted by Assistant’ Director
DeLoach concerning the information furnished to him by Chalmers regarding
Oswald. and to advise Willis that thé information is not factual, it
appears that Shelton is circulating the story in order to possibly. .
discredit Venable, whor. he feels.has furnished information to the
Committee concerning Shelton and Shelton’s Klan organization. Although
Venable did testify in executive session, a review of .the testimony
indicates that he furnished little or no information of value, and = _.-
Shelton's assumption is erroneous. ae a a

. THe information regarding Shelton?’ s proposed visit to the .
Veterans Administration is. known only to a limited number of individuals

\the event the source and Anderson, who is also a Bureau informant. In
t

 

he event we. advise the Veterans Administration of this matter, it could
possibly resalt in the Loss: of. two valuable sources since the Veterans -
Administrat ion may reveai that they had advance knowledge of this visit.
ft\is not believed that any real. harm will be caused by this action on
the ‘part of Shelton and, therefore, it is felt that. the Veterans

Hemindstgarion should, not be advised,
