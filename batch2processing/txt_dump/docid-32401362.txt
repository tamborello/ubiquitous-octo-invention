5 May 1964
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Discussion at Luncheon Meeting 5 May with The President,
Rusk, McNamara, Taylor, Bundy and McCone

1. Ambassador Lodge's May 4th cable #2108 was discussed
in considerable detail. The consensus was that the Khanh sentiments
represent the most serious expressions since he has taken over, and
that Ambassador Lodge's comments, though brief, indicated that he
somewhat supported Khanh's appraisal of the situation and courses. of
action recommended although Lodgedid not say so. It was decided:

a. McNamara should proceed to Saigon at the
earliest, accompanied by Taylor, Bill Bundy and Forrestal.
An alternative suggestion was made that the three-named
parties precede McNamara by two or three days.

NOTE:. Subsequently I discussed privately with
Bundy having intelligence support, particularly such as
Bill Colby, accompany or precede McNamara. No
decision was made.

2. In discussing the pros and cons of dispatching a private
warning to Castro, pointing out the demands of the domestic political
situation, it was felt that any further discussions with Castro should
be through U Thant of the UN since Castro had addressed a letter to
U Thant.

en aud Balance of the luncheon was consumed discussing the
numbered items 3 through 7 on the attached agenda, none of which
have particular intelligence interest except the decision was made to
continue the sale of Pratt-Whitney's T-30 engine (the engine for the
TFX),to. the French even though doing s so would enhance the French
nuclear capability

—SEGRET Agenda for luncheon meeting, May 5, 1964

Lodge's latest message and a draft answer.

Yesterday Lodge sent in a report of an extraordinary conversation
with General Khahn in which Khahn proposed that South Vietnam
go on a "war footing, 'yto include a major evacuation of Saigon,
warnings to Hanoi, and a break in relations with France.

The message is attached at Tab A, and I understand Secretary
Rusk will bring a draft answer for discussion.

 

Further discussion of Cuba, I believe that there are two subjects
which need discussion in a smaller group than the NSC,

(1) A possible private warning to Castro

(2) A possible private intimation to Castro that if things
stay quiet, 1965 might be a year for serious
discussions between Cuba and the U.S,
