Rerep SA Clark A. Hull, dated 10/14/63, at Chicago.

It ie assumed that the two Bray interviews reflected on
the Interview Report Forus in the Adainistrative portion of rerep
. Were not included in the details since it was not desized that Bray's
_cooperation with the Bureau become known to the USA's office in
Chicago. The Bureau agrees that the results of interviews vith:
Bray would be of no particular value to eithor the 084 in
or Miami, since this cage is being handied by Departasxt Attorney
Robert D. Peloguin of the Criminal Division.

  

The Bureau does feel, however, that the Bray intervieve
are of intense interest to the Criminal Division and should be.
get forth in e separate report. Chicago immediately
supplemental report, contz ths results of -@ t.
views. Copies of this report should not be furnished’ the 4

in Chicago or Miami, However, an additiounl copy sheuld be fo ;
the Miami Office for dissemination to Department Attorney Rebort BD.
Peloquin, Results of future interviews with Bray having a bearing
on this case should be handled in the sam® manner.

With reference to the material ring on the cover.
pages of rerep supplied by CG 6588-C-TE, it would appear that the |
Criminal Division would have an interest in this information. In

coum View Of this, Chicago should immediately prepare a LEM, suitable. -

NOTE: Bray is being interviewed by our Chicago Office in connection
With captioned matter and the Teamsters Bonding Program cases, at

the request of the Criminal Division. The Criminal Division requested
that contacts with Bray be handled on a discreet basis since his
cooperation with the Government, if known, might result in reprisals
peing taken against him by the Chicago hoodlum element. It is

noted that Bray is currently in contact with Alderisio (a well known
Chicago top noodlum) and that on one occasion previously Alderisio

had threatened Bray. Instructions were previously furnished the
Chicago Office that there was to be no indication given outside the
Bureau, either directly or jndirectly, that Bray was cooperating -
with the Government. tn view of the above conditions it is felt t
that precautions outlined herein should be taken in order

tom: further conceal Bray's cooperation.
