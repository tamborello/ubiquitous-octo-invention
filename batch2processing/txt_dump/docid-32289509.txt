-ReBulet 6/4/62 and TPlet 5/17/62.

. The Tampa Office is most aware of the urgent need and
necessity to develop highly confidential source coverage on
Subject and his associates and/or subordinates. TPlet of
5/17/62 did not intend to imply that we had stopped all efforts
for confidential source coverage re subject; our letter was to
inform Bureau concerning efforts for such coverage at subject's
residence. Previous weekly airtels to Bureau have set out what
steps we have been taking and continue to take toward confidential

source coverage, all of which are directed toward subject and his
; associates, ‘

  
  
  

In view of information set out in TPlet 5/17/62 that
the problems encountered at subject's residence negate such UB
confidential coverage, the Tampa Office took immediate aggressivé
action relative to authority received to Survey the Dream Bar, /'}'-
2801-03 Nebraska Avenue. Fisurs of the Dream Bar were conducted‘
on May 29, 31, and June 1, 1962. This established that such ‘=
business place was not vacated at any time and that after the.

Bar closes for business and FANO TRAFFICANTE leaves, a cleanup 4
man stays on and remains in the building with all lights on. -

In view of the fact, then, that entry with security
could not be obtained at the Dream Bar, the Tampa Office has
now initiated the following steps with an aggressive, deter- ,;
mined, imaginative approach to accomplish our greatest desires,
the installation of numerous highly confidential sources which
will place the Tampa Office in a position to know the activities.

of numerous racket figures. : f

. 2. The JOE R. DIEZ residence is to be entered and misur-
installed in the immediate future. JOE DIEZ is considered a
racket figure (Bureau authority).

2. Survey of Ernesto's Bar and Package Store,
1901 - 42th Avenue, is under way, and this location is where
numbers figures GINES RIVERO and ERNESTO ALVAREZ operate, as
well as JOE R. DIEZ. Just as soon as the sound-trained Agent
establishes what can be done, fisurs will be established for
entry and installation. (Bureau authority received to survey.) -

3. Bureau authority has been. requested to survey
Dixie Amusement Co., Inc., 702 West Columbus Drive, which is
operated by TOM DIECIDUE and brother, FRANK DIECIDUE, the latter
considered a racket figure.

4. Bureau authority has been requested to survey the
Yellow House Bar, 15th Street and llth Avenue, which is known to
be a hangout for AUGUSTINE PRIMO LAZZARA and NICK FURCI, racket
figures. .

Relative to the above-identified targets, the following |
steps and procedures were initiated on June 1, 1962:
‘ . f

1. JOE R. DIEZ

A fisur was to be established by the Agent assigned
the case so that entry could be accomplished with security and
the sound-trained Agent and another Agent might accomplish
installation. JOE DIEZ and his wife are, known to be residing
in the residence, and whenever they leave the residence they

will be surveilled. Entry Agents will thereafter, with radio |. ~

equipment, traverse several hundred yards of open space in rural
area and gain entry to accomplish installation. A plant area
has been secured approximately. one-half mile from subject
residence, — . / 2

2. ERNESTO'S BAR AND PACKAGE STORE

As of June 1, 1962, it was ascertained thus far
relative to this establishment that a pair on cable J is a
"burglar loop" from Ernesto's to Tampa Signal Company. Above .
the area of the cafe, however, there is a social club of which
a security confidential source was president as of July, 1961.
Contact with this source was set--for June 6, 1962, at which

time the feasibility of this source's assistance would be
determined concerning ingress to establishment. This matter

, is being aggressively followed so as to establish best approach

installation to be made can be determined and. appropriate FD-142

submitted.

3. DIXIE AMUSEMENT CO., INC.

EARL E, FEY, operator of E. & L. Sign Company, located
' immediately adjacent to this establishment, has already been:

of business will be used as a blind for Agents in securing |

subsequent entry into Dixie Amusement Co.

 

It is sincerely anticipated that the Bureau will not
have to remind the Tampa Office that it does not have highly
confidential source coverage, and that the immediate future
will accomplish the above-cited installations, which are but
few to the many needed and desired by Agents working the CIP
in Tampa. . . , .
