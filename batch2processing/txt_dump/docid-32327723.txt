MM cenrus SECRET

For the information of the Bureau, on 6/11/63,
during a conversation relative to the whereabouts of
QUIZA and his group, Lt. AARON ROGERS, U. S. Coast Guard
Intelligence Office, confidentially advised that QUIZA was
quite "sharp" and had been to see Customs about removing
their fisur.

It ; is to be noted that SHANLEY of Customs advised

on 6/9/63 that Customs had about an "80%" surveillance on
'QUIZA's boat, as of the evening of 6/7/63, when they lost

the surveillance. SHANLEY was obviously upset and embarrassed
by the disappearance of the boat. SHANLEY had previously
indicated the boat located at Dinner Key Yacht Basin was

under a close surveillance at a considerable expenditure of
manpower.

 

ROGERS related that QUIZA had gone to Customs,
told them he was not going anywhere and that there was no
need to wate their men's time. He said he needed at least
15 hours on his new engine before he would be ready to go. i
ROGERS said that Customs kept the check on anyway but k
indicated that it was somewhat relaxed, as a consequence of
which QUIZA was able to depart.

In addition, inconfirmation of the above, EDDIE
MOR RUIZ was contacted at 10:00 A. M., Friday, 6/7/63,
according to a previous arrangement. QUIZA was expected to
have been present also and that both would be taken to the
Miami Office in an effort to obtain a signed statement re-
garding their intentions. MOR claimed QUIZA was not well and
could not make the appointment but would appear at 10:00 io M.
on 6/10/63, the next Monday. MOR mentioned that "We can't =,
go anywhere - everytime we take the boats out we have company".
He then said that QUIZA had been down to see Customs to tell |
them he was not ready to go and that they just wanted to
test their new engine.

i
{
;

As Bureau was advised in one of retels, QUIZA and :
MOR were served with "Prevention of Departure Notices" by
INS and consideration being given to serving the other eight.
