On February 25, 1958, ARTHUR F. SCHWARTZ advised |

that he had a former client by the name of OSCAR’ SCHULTZ, . :

whom he represented in the incorporation of a company called

United Dryer Sales and Service, Incorporated, SCHWARTZ

advised that he was an incorporator of this company and also

had been. Statutory Agent for it. SCHWARTZ said that he had | |

represented. OSCAR SCHULTZ, a man who owned a car wash and who

had: so“ been in the coin operated machine business for

sometime: before SCHULTZ wanted to incorporate in order to

handle the manufacture and sale of a small, hot air, drying

machine for use in washrooms , etc.

 

 

SCHWARTZ advised that he thought that SCHULTZ had
hold of a good idea and that he would be producing a good
and saleable product in the 1952#1953 period. SCHWARTZ said
he even got his partner, SILVERSTEIN, to agree to take their
fees in the form of stock in the corporation, but SCHULTZ L
would not agree to this, SCHWARTZ advised it developed that
the product was not so good; in fact, the dryer would not work,

However, SCHWARTZ said that he had applied for and
obtained an Illinois Charter: for the United Dryer Corporation
and all he and his partner could manage to collect out of it
was that they got their corporation costs from SCHULTZ, but
he refused to pay them their fee, SCHWARTZ pointed out that
