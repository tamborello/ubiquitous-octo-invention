time it was under the control and domination of Dallag Communist
Party (CP) members. LOWERY stated the defense also will attempt
to develop through his testimony some evidence that would tend
te shew MOLINA had some knowledge of the CP connection with the’
Dallas chapter of G. I. Forum. ;

  

LOWERY understood HOLINA’s attorney is OTTO HULLINAZ,
Pallas, SIHPSON told LOWERY that CBS is represented by a firm.
of attorneys; the full firm name not recalled by LOWERY, but
included the names cf CANDLE, GOOTCH, and several other names. .
LOWERY believes it is a Fort Worth, Texas, law firm. ERLD is -
represented by an attorney identified as PAT PATTERSGN, Dallas,
by SINPSON. .

fhe abeve is furnished for the Bureau's information.
Por its further infermation, DALE SIMPSON and Asseciates is the
firm in. which WILLIAM A. MURPHY, former SAC ef the Dallas FBI.
Office, is currently employed. MURPHY in 1953 and 1956 was .
personally supervising security and security informant type cases
in the Ballas Office and should be well aware of the identities ~
of CP members and Bureau informantssduring that period of time.
Jt is to be noted that the names of DL-6~5 and DL-1-5, current
informants, could possibly be disclosed in the trial of the above
described law suit since these two informants_as well as LOWERY,
were then CP members reporting on CP matters.| (ju k

Lork LOVERY plans to testify for the defefse in that law
suit. He advised he would keep the Dallas Gffiee advised con-
cerning any pertinent new developments.
