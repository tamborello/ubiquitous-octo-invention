All the same, I have not been able to perceive any repercussions on
persons mentioned in my reports, I must add, though, that I have kept these
reports very general without accusing anybody specifically. KRUG, assigned
the cover name "Fritz WALL." to me by which 1 used to sign my reports. From
time tc time 1 received a pack of cigarettes for my work, but nothing else.

ifter my release ] have been employed by the firm SIMSON in SUHL, and
again I contacted by an MPS agent by name of either NEUB UEK or NEUGEBAUER,
He made me write reports on the production of Mopeds and on the difficulties
of their manufacture. For this work 1 received from NEUBAUER up to DM 100
(East) from time to time. “gain 1 used te sign the reports with my cover
name "Fritz wWALlbR".

Since Christmas 195é, 1 started living separately from my wife. i
filed a divoree, because 1 am sure that I am not the father of her child;
the case was dismissed though. Up tc now 1 have no paid any support for
the child. However, my wife has taken my accident annuity and spent it for
her own purposes.

I believe izhave told everything 1 kmow. I have given this information
voluntarily and told the truth.

I am not able to make further statements.

The Folice Department im BERLIN informed us with iWX Nor 415, dated 7 June
1960, that the preliminary investigation of WiLLM’NN was submitted from the
Public Prosecutor BERLIN - 2 Pds 1046/60 + not to the Chief Federal Prosecutor

Also in accordanee with my orders i prepared sketches of the Camp King
(GBERURSEL) fence line, they wanted me to especially indicate the distance
from the fence to the temporary barracks. This sketch I mailed from FA: NKFURT/M
to the cover address I was given.

I must amend that for the trip from LUEBECK to MUNICH I received DM
75 (West in addition to DM 200 (West).

In the aforementioned cities I stayed for about 2 weeks altogether. By
the middle of June I left FRANKFURT on a hitehhike trip all over the Federal
Republic. On this trip I came through MUNICH, STUTTGART, HANNOVER, and other
smaller towns the name of which I have forgotten. In H)NNOVER I have been
last week. The reason for this sort of vagrancy has been a certa.n fear of
being apprehended by the West German police and the doubt of a successful
crossing of the Zone border. 4s a matter of fact, I had in mind to quit
working for the MfS and was not sure if 1 ought to return to the Zone. Lven-
tually 1 came around to the conviction that giving myself up to the police
would be the best way to break with the past. When asked where my reception
eertificate of the BLN-M&ARIENFELD Reception Cump was, I truthfully replied
that I had mailed the document to Karl LiMBERT, an MfS agent, mail address
B’D SALZUNGEN, This happened in May in UBERURSEL. i also inelosed the re~
ferral slip and the health certificate. 1 had been assigned the mission by
LeMBERT to mail him the originals of these papers and tha’. is what I did.

while I have been in confinement in the BaU?ZEN penitentary I signed a
paper for a State Security agent named KRUG, who has been employed as a wel-
fare commissioner of the penitentiary, a paper, by which 1 was obligated to
prepare morale reports on my fellow-inmates and on the attitude of the

policement towards the convicts, This 1 have carried out about 25 or 30 times.

Sinee 1 had declared myself willing to report to the MfS after a certain

time, I quit my job and left SCHUANDURF without formal no ice of departure.

i went as far as LUEBECK on the train and went aeross the torder near SCHLUTUP.

 

the direction of Lust Germany. Then I reported to the Hast German border
police, and the MfS from GHEVMMUEHLEN picked me up with a car, There 1 wrote

up and presented a report about my observations during my stay in BE:LIN~
MALIENFELDE, about my flight to FRANKFURI/M, and about Camp King. 1 also
mentioned the name of Karl LAMBENT of MERKERS, from whom I had received this
mission, But we were not brought together. 1 stayed in GREVESMUEHLEN until
Sunday evening. In BREVESMUEHLEN 1 received from 4 members of the MES, whose

names I don't know, the mission to go to WEST G&KM.NY and to_ spy upon the lay-
