As set forth in the section. >f the report concerning

aq Prior to—teaening OF Oswald's -probable contact

with DGI officers, James Angletor, Chief of the CIA's
Counter Intelligence Staff passec. an. internal memorandém
to Raymond Rocca, also of the Counterintelligence Staff.
Angleton wrote in the memorandum that he had been informed
by the DDP, Richard Helms, that J. Lee Rankin had contacted
John NeCoe to request that the Director consent to an

interview 4y the Warren commission on May 14, 1964. (J.

Edgar Hoover also appeared before the Commission on that

date prior to McCone's appearance.) Angleton also wrote:

I discussed with Mr. Helms the nature of the
recent information which you are processing
which originated with the sensitive wirere Gd bP
Hewee source. I informed 1im that in your -
view this would raise a nunber of new factors
with the Commission, that it should not go to
the Commission prior to th: Director's appear-
ance unless we have first iad some preliminary
reaction or made sure that ‘the Director is fully
aware of the implications since it could well
serve as the basis for detiiled questioning.
The DDP stated that he would review this care-
fully and made (sic) a decision as to the
question of timing. (Angle<on memo, 12 May

On May 15, 1964, the day ofemme: Mcle® S$ interview,

As cited with regard to Luisa Calderon, a defec-
tor from the Cuban Intelliger.ce Services provided the
CIA with significant information about Lee Harvey Oswald's
contacts with the DGI in Mexico City. This defector .
was assigned the CIA cryptonjm AMMUG-1 (A-1 hereinafter) .*
CIA files reveal that A-1.defected from the DGI
on April 21, 1964 in -) When
he defected, A-1 possessed a number of DGI documents which
: were subsequently turned ove: to the cia.(i ye 68894,
24 April 64) Following his defection, a CIA officer,
Joseph H. “Langosch, went t pe meet A-1, debrief
him, and arrange for A-l's travel into the United States.
(See supra cite.) On May 1, 1964, 22 reels of Langxash's /
debriefing of A-l were forwaided to the Chief of the CIA's
Special Affairs Staff from th : ; )
‘) Effective on May 1, A*1 was under contract with
the CIA for operational purposes. (Contract Approving Of-
ficer memo, 6 May 44) By June 23, 1964, Langosch was
convinced that a-1 would be o£ great value to the Agency.
He stated:

\ . There is no question :.n my mind that AMMUG-1

*It is now known that A-1 did provide significant leads to

the CIA regarding Luisa Calderon. It is further apparent

that little of this informa-:ion was niade available by the

CIA to the Warren Commission. Therefore, the possibility

exists that A-1" had provided other information to the CIA

that was relevant to the Waren Commission's work bet~that which
was not properly reported to the Commission.
