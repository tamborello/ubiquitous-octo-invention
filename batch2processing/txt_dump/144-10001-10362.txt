5. In short, that was the speech,

The inkexeskine” thing is that while the Soviet Union
only answered these accusdtions with an article in the.
newspaper and expressed their sorrow in a meaningful manner
by sending Deputy Prime Minister MIKOYAN to Washington, ‘CASTRO
considered it necessary to answer the accusations of the’ U.S.
press officially as Prime Minister ina speech at a time ‘when
friends and enemies of the U.S, generally were: expressing \ ‘their
respect for KENNEDY. Also interesting is the fact’ that he’. not
only defended Cuba but the Soviet Union as well. . .
