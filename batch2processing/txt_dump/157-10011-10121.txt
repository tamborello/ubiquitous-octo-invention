By 6 February 1956, figures were produced showing that
$13,500 would cover one year continuation of the indexing,
$7,000 for $3,000 for a clerk typist; and $3,000 for
part-time help and supplies. On this date, Gaynor noted he
"would Like to see this project completed if at all possible."

 

 

 

 

By the first week of March 1956, ‘front office" verbal
approval had been given for OS funding of the project, labeled
Operation Recall, concurrent with a meeting between McCord
and and arrangements were made for transporting the
completed portion of the index to Washington, D. C. McCord
estimated the value of the index at that time as being be-
tween $15,000 to $25,000 in labor alone. During this week
favorable National Agency Name Checks were concluded on

Security Office funds to total $10,000 in all, to continue
Wiley's indexing for one additional year. The partially
completed index was turned over to the Agency on 8 March 1956.

first came to the official atten-
tion oF the Office of Security (OS) on 9 September 1955,
when |\(Executive Officer. OS) forwarded a

to James W. McCord [Security Research Staff of the Office

telephone number, and advised that he was working
on an index of the Daily Worker for the years 1933-1945

‘and thought that perhaps you might be interested in
specific information that I am likely to find."

On 10° September 1955, James W. McCord contacted |_|

h hv Lee Pennington (a former employee _of the FBI).
started the index in November 1954, stated
he contacted the major government agencies in Washington

to ascertain what information in the Daily Worker would
‘be of most interest to them, and in addition, Contacted

a couple of Congressional Committees which McCord surmised
were the House Committee on Un-Ameri Fivities and the
Senate Internal Security Committee. estimated it
would take tw da half years to compléte the index. At
that time, was receiving part-time clerical assis-
tance from the Women's Auxili the American Legion
Post in Flushing, New York. also indicated an in-
terest in Agency employment after finishing the index.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The results of McCord's interview with were
brought to the attention of Robert Bannerman, Députy Direc-
tor of Security, by 21 November 1955, when Bannerman opined
that "this may be valuable." ,

, “McCord met next with in Washington, D. C., for
two days, ending on 1 December 1955. By that time,

had indexed 150,000 names of the i Worker covering
January 1934 through June 1936. stated that the
FBI in New York City and the American Legion_were already
making "extensive use” of the index cards. stated
that one of his purposes being in Washington was to secure
financing for the index continuation. He stated that his
$5000 a year grant from the American Legion Americanism
Committee would expire at the end of December 1955, and

if negotiations with that body were unsuccessful, he would
attempt to secure financing from the Senate and House Inves-~-
tigating Committees. stated that the FBI has indi-
cated the strongest desire that he continue the indexing
put that in his discussion with Mr. DeLoach (Cartha Deloach,
an FBI senior official), no indication of forthcoming finan-
cial support from the Bureau for this work was indicated.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In recording this contact with McCord opined:

 

"Y think it is obvious that the index

 

which is working on would be of con-
| siderable value iv tho Security Ottice ana
@ to CIA, particularly since the Communist

Party membership and activities during the
1934-40 period were for the most part very
open and extensively advertised in the Daily
Worker. An example of how open their actlvi-
ties were is indicated in the fact that
Elizabeth Bentley's name was mentioned in

a 1935 issue of the Daily Worker at a time
prior to her going underground and acquiring
a RIS (Russian Intelligence Service) mission.
if the Daily Worker thus bears 4 record of
(Communist) Party activities of an indi-
vidual such as Bentley, who later became

so prominent in RIS activities in the

United States, then the possibility always
exists that the names of persons later con-
nected with OSS (Office of Strategic Services)
and other governmental activity may also be
mentioned in the 1934-40 Daily Worker issues,
which have heretofcre never been indexed by
any government agency.
