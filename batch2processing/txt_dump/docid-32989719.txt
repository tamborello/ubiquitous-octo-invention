CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUH ; : <

 

This morning, in accordance with the request of the Pres ide nt
conveyed to me personally by him last Wednesday in New York City, I called
at the White House at 9:15 and was with the President until 10:15.

“He was desirous of discussi ing the questdon of the subversive
activities in the United States, particularly Fasdism and Commilisu. He
had previously received the memorandum which I had prepared covering ny
conversation with General Smedley Butler and the effort of Father?
tahave General*Sutler head an exoedition to Mexico. I informed the
concerning certain recent developments in the Communist activities in the |
country, particularly the efforts of the Bridges organization in Sen Fran-
cisco and their progressive control of the shipping oa the Pacific Coast,
the Gulf Coast and their recent expansion to shipping operations on the
Atlantic Coast. I told hin that while their contract will expire on.
Septexber 30, 1936, they are endeavoring to have it temporarily extended

_uavil April 141937, in order to conform to the same date that the uni ive
“Mine Workers! contract expires, which organization is headed by John L.
Lewis. I told hin that the Bridges organization was practically controls ec
by Communists ond that the Commmists had now decided to make very definite

plans to get control of the Lewis organization. ; °

 

 

I called his attention to the activities of the Newsp paper Guild
headed by Heywood Broun, vhich has strong Commmnistic leanings, end which
has been responsible for putting out of operation the Seatt tle Pos 3% Invel-
ligencer. I told him that my information was that the Commmists had plamnec
to get control of these three groups and by doing so they would be able at
any time to paralyze the country in that they could stop all shipping in
and out through the Bridges organizévion; stop the operation of indu ustry
through the Mining Union of Lewis; and stop publicat tion of any newspapers
of tae country varough the Newspaper Guild.

I also related to him the activities which have recently oc-
curred within Governmental service inspired by Comaunists, particularly
in some of the Departments and in the National Labor Relations Board.
