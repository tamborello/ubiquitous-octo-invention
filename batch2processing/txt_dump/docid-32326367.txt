HANARD is also currently cooperating with the Miami
Office in a case involving CHARLES KARPF, a racketeer who has
recently been charged with receiving stolen goods consisting
o£ $50,000.00 worth of stolen bonds.

For the information of the Bureau, HANARD is regarded
locally by law enforcement agencies as a somewhat unscrupulous
private detective. He has a penchant for newspaper publicity.
He is a "name dropper" and indicates to his acquaintances that
he has good connections with all law enforcement agencies in

i' this area. At the same time, it is suspected by some law
| enforcement officials that HANARD might be engaged in blackmail

 

and other similar practices through operation of his detective
agency.

It is believed that in this case, HANARD has no
actual intention of ever launching an expedition to Cuba, and
that he is using this organization, the Freedom Fighters of
the Americas, as a means of obtaining publicity and enhancing
his own importance. It appears that this organization is in

the process, of "dying on the vine'’. .
