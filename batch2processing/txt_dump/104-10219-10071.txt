Mitchell dislikes Soviet life, speaks little Russian, and
is unable to read Russian books. He receives a pension of
approximately 500 rubles (about US$715) a month, and has
regular visits from the KGB.

6. In May 1973, when Tenenbaum was teaching English
to a number of prospective Jewish emigrants in Leaingrad,
he was subjected to a recruitment attempt by the “£72 which
wanted him to report on alleged Zionist instigators of the
Jewish exodus from the USSR. Tenenbaus refused to report
on his students, rejected this attempted recruitment, and
subsequently openly recounted the recruitment atterpt to
four groups of his students totalling about 40 Jews.
Tenenbaum felt’ that this was the best way to ensure that
the KGB would never bother him again.

7. When he later described his reaction to the recruit~-
ment attempt to Mitchell, Mitchell told him he had acted
wisely, particularly in revealing his signing of a secrecy
agreement which the would-be KGB recruiter had dictate@ to

him.

8. Just prior to Tenenbaun's departure from the Soviet
Union in May 1975, he again visited Mitchell to return a
book. On that occasion Mitchell was morose, and asked how
he could leave the USSR illegally. Mitchell mentioned
using the documents of a sailor on a foreign vessel as one
possibility in this regard.
