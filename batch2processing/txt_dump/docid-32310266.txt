re an : Treg,

outside envelope was written the name of/,SOYLO (phonetic): which Lieutena:

vila stated is the alias of an individu “WHO is known to be head of the
action group in Santiago for the 26 of July Movement. By action group,
‘Vila statéd that SOYLO's responsibility was the planting of bombs,

- handling 26 of July Movement agents and getting volunteers for the rebel
movement into contact with the Movement. SOYLO, according to Vila,
would not be the person who would be contacted by a newspaper man
attempting to get into rebel territory. Since SANTAMARINA in Miami is.
considered so important in the.Movement and has spent one year with

. YFIDELYCASTRO up until April, she would have known that SOYLO was not

S the oper contact for a newspaper man since SOYLO's activities are so
much more protected and his name as a contact would only be given to
someone who was on vitally important business for the Movement. Vila-
said that usually courier activities to the rebels go through Guantanam
Naval Base and that in a routine courier contact, this route would be ~
‘used and the military authorities feel. that subject's contact with

_ SOYLO was in co ection with a very important phase of the Movement’s

left FIDEL CASTRO's group in April,, 1958, after one year in rebel =:
territory. She went to the United States with an individual who is.
known a Captain CABAROCAS and whose full name is believed to be™

: Lieutenant Vila pointed out that Cuban authorities arrested
the subject immediately after he had spent. 14 to 14 hours talking to |
SOYLO after his contact with SOYLO had been arranged by the daughter
of the landlady of the poarding house. At the time of subject's arrest,
all the other people in the boarding house were also arrested, but SOYLC
had already departed. The subject, however, stated he had plane
reservation from Santiago to Miami leaving three hours after the arrest
whereas he claimed he was going into the mountains to get a newspaper
story and also stated that SOYLO in the interview said he was wasting |
his time and should not attempt to get into rebel territory. It appears,
however, that before SOYLO gave him this advice he had already m di
reservations to leave Santiago, according to Lieutenant ‘Vila. fu ;

: At. SIM headquarters subject removed his shirt and showed black

. ort Lauderdale, Floriga, at
, 310 N._E. 5th Street with his uncle who is also known as FRAN AFIORINI,
“and that he had some money and was pilanning to open a.bar in Fort ~~ |
,, Lauderdale. He said that one day. w Te in Miami he met a RICHARD .
‘SAUNDERS , who is a friend of HAYD. ANTAMARINA, Subject was not sure
' about “the name SAUNDERS, and when asked as to how he was supposed to
later contact SAUNDERS, he said he would .do this through SANTAMARINA.
He gave the story that SAUNDERS was a free lance newspaper man who had

told subject that if he went to Cuba and entered the mountains where the

. U..S. citizens were being -held captive by the rebels and got a story
on the captivity, SAUNDERS thought he could sell the story to :
newspaper and there would probably be $500 for the subject. MO

_ He stated with this idea in mind he left Miami July 4, 1958,
.by Pan American and went from Havana to Santiago de Cuba the following
day by Cubana. He spent one week in Santiago before he was arrested
by Cuban authorities on July 18, 1958, at noon. He stated he had a
reservation on Pan American from Santiago,te Miami on a flight which
was to leave on the same day at 3 p.m. 203) :
According to Lieutenant Vila, Cuban authorities arrested the
subject asleep in a room in a@ boarding house where he had been living.
This boarding house was known to Cuban authorities as a contact point
and safe house for the 26 of July Movement. Subject became very
friendly with the daughter of the woman who ran the boarding house and
she admitted to Lieutenant Vila that she was’ not only a sympathizer
of the 26 of July Movement but was acting as a contact for them. She

because she had been threatened with being thrown out of Cuba and she
thought false accusations might: be made against her and she would be
_ framed in a criminal matter. :
