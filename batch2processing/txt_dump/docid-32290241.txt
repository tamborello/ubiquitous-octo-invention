Several years ago, the "syndicate gambling boys" tried
to muscle him out of his business and rather:than bow
to the demands of the "boys", he told them they could
have all of his business and he would leave the Chicago
area, He did this and went to Newport, Kentucky, where
he operated a book for a while, then went to Montreal,
Canada, and returned to Terre Haute, Indiana, where he
was arrested for bookmaking, in 1958. He was arrested
by federal authorities and indicted for not paying the
10 per cent gross federal tax on gambling bets.

On June 14, 1961, CG.T-5 advised that he had
recently been in contact with GUS LIEBE and LIEBE informed
him that the J&J Picnic Grove is still operating as a
gambling casino on weekends in Will County, Illinois.

On May 24, 1961, Miss BETTY GEORGE, 300 East 57th
Street, Apartment 2c, New York, New York, advised SAs
DONALD E. JONES and WILLIAM D, KANE that she first met
GUS ALEX in approximately 1950. At that time, she was
with the road company of the broadway play, "Kiss Me Kate",
Miss GEORGE stated that she is presently a singer who
performs with the MILTON BERLE show. She said that
after a performance in "Kiss Me Kate" in Chicago, she was
with her mother at the Chez Paree Night Club, and one night
after a show was introduced to ALEX by someone whose name
she could not recall. She stated that she and ALEX had a
very short, casual conversation, mainly dealing with the
fact that they were both of Greek extraction,

She stated she next saw ALEX in 1955 when she
was appearing at the Latin Quarter in New York City.
ALEX attended a show one evening and between performances
introduced her to his wife, MARIANNE, referring to her
(Miss GEORGE) as his "Greek cousin". He invited her to
have dinner with him and his wife, but she refused this
invitation because of a prior commitment. Miss GEORGE
stated that these are the only contacts she has had with
ALEX. She said she knows nothing at all about what ALEX
does for a living or who his associates might be. She
identified photographs of ALEX and his former wife,
MARIANNE.

‘Miss GEORGE further advised that during the month
of June, 1961, she will appear with MILTON BERLE at the
Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, and that in the
event she comes in contact with ALEX in the future, she
will advise the New York Office of the FBI,

CG T-5 advised that he formerly operated a
horse-book at Clark and Webster Street, Chicago, and at
that time bookmakers were required to pay $400 per month
to the police for protection against harassment. He
understands that now, each horse-book is required to make.
a payment of $400 a week for the same type of protection.

CG T-5 said that he was acquainted with LEO

"BOOKIE" SCHAEFFER when SCHAEFFER was operating one of
the largest handbooks on Fullerton Avenue in Chicago.
