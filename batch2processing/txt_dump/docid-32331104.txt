KONIGSBERG said that even though CHARLIE "The
Blade" TOURINE and GYP DE CARLO are members of the same
"family," years ago DE CARLO wanted "The Russian! killed,
"The Russian" is GEORGE VAINTRAUB, who works with CHARLIE
in bust-out games, However, KONIGSBERG declined to handle this
contract. In the event the contract was accepted, Dz CARLO
wanted it to appear as if CHARLIE "The Blade" was the one
who was responsible for the killing, Supposedly, "The Russian"
was in a game where AL MONES was busted out. .

KONIGSBERG pointed out that whenever he dealt with
a person he was always attempting to exzassify him as weak or
strong. Based on certain incidents and reputations, he
classified CARMINE TRAMUNTI, aka "Gribbs"; TONY GORALLO, aka
"Tony Ducks" and CHARLIE TOURINE as strong, and SAM RIZZO
(DE CAVALCANTE) as being very weak. \_

KONIGSBERG on 8/4/65, advised SAS ROBERT V., WALKER
and PAUL G. DURKIN that JOE ZICARELLI did not becone a "made
guy" in“La Cosa Nostra"until 1955. He explained that most
likely he would have been. "made" in an earlier year; however,
GYP DE CARLO, CHARLIE WHITE (TOURINE ) and LILO GALANTE were
all attempting to get ZICARELLI in their respective crews,
After much haggling, GALANTE finally won out. KONIGSBERG
added that ZICARELLI was actually close to all three of these
persons, :
