or contact with Alpha 66. CIA stated that it had no value because

of its discrediting in the Cuban exile community by the disclosure
of the secret alliance between its leader, Veciana, and Eloy
Gutierrez Menoyo, head of SNFE. Under their alliance Gutierrez
diverted Alpha 66. funds to finance SNFE paramilitary operations and
ran them as Alpha 66 activities, The Alpha 66 combat element had no
exploitable military value because it was either identical with or
heavily penetrated by the Gutierrez action group. The dissident
element of Alpha 66, referred to as L66, was regarded by CIA as a.
superficial split due to the presence in L66, particularly its
combat group, of Alpha 66 operational peseppoels who had been and

probably would remain Gutierrez's men. (%

was still Commandante of the Cuban Army and had gone to Costa Rica
secretly by way of Mexico. At a subsequent meeting Dr. Lacayo
offered the position of leader of the war effort against Nicaragua

happened between Gutierrez and Fidel Castro, and Gutierrez had to
flee Cuba. Zayas stated that he did not know of any subsequent plans
