Mr. Burke,

Attached is a request from the SSCI.
I have talked to Fred Cassedy at the FBI
and he says that the Committee is looking
into the Kennedy assassination and that
the SSC provided Veciana's name.

I intend to contact Howard Liebengood
next week and will probably arrange for
the SSCI to review the document out here

at that time.

Vice Admiral B. R. Inman

Director

National Security Agency

Fort George G. Meade, Maryland 20755

Dear Mr. Director:

The Select Committee on Assassinations was
established by the House of Representatives pursuant
to House Resolutions 222 and 433 to investigate the
assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. In conjunction with our
investigation into the assassination of President
Kennedy, it has come to the Committee's attention that
the National Security Agency has information which
‘will be of substantial assistance to the Committee's
inquiry.

The information to which the Committee staff
needs access and which is held by the National Security
Agency is all outlines and summaries and biographical
data relating to the Cuban Intelligence network of
Premier Castro covering the period from 1959 - December 31,
1964 with emphasis on operations by Cuban Intelligence
operatives in the United States and other Latin American
countries, and any analyses of the direction and evaluation
of specific assassination operations.

In addition, the Committee requests that it be
provided access to any other materials you have relevant
to the assassination of President Kennedy or any
investigation into the assassination. Access to all
materials we will receive from the National Security
Agency will be restricted to staff members with a TOP
SECRET security clearance.

The Committee requests that it be provided with
these materials as soon as possible, and would very much
appreciate it if we could receive such access prior to
the end of December. Should you have any questions con-
cerning this request, please address them to myself or
our Chief Counsel, G. Robert Blakey.

” Chairman
