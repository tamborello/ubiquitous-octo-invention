Mr. Dennin. The Deputy being the COP?

Mr. Bissell. Correct.

Mr. Dennin. And the C/CA, that was the individual in the
office charged with what?

Mr. Bissell. Covert action.

Mr. Dennin. Specifically that would include provision of
things and getting advice on things like placing bombs?

Mr. Bissell. I suppose it would, although most of its

 

efforts had to do with political action.
Mr. Dennin. Turning to Tab K, that being a memorandum for

1

the record of the February 15 meeting in New York, the memorandum
of February 16, you will note on page 5 that that memoranda |
describes a meeting held between the Chief, WH3;, that branch
of the CIA having direct line responsibility for the Dominican
Republic.

Mr. Bissell. That is correct.

Mr. Bissell. I believe that's right.

See that, sir?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, I do.

Mr. Dennin. Now let me point out a couple of things
raised in this memorandum. Once again there is very specific
discussion of assassination, a method of assassinating Mr.
Trujillo which is discussed as using a powerful bomb. A
further method is putting poison in Trujillo's food or alter-
natively in his medicine, and finally, possible methods of

delivering arms and materials to the dissidents are discussed.

 

 

 

 

 

Specifically at the end of that Paragraph 3 you will note that

reports that @EMBECK! turned his attention away from arms ~

and started talking about delivery of other typas of materials,
exotic materials, powerful bombs,
Mr. Bissell. I am not finding that particular paragraph.
Mr. Dennin. Say the beginning of Paragraph 4. Let me

just read you the first sentence of Paragraph 4.

GAJsaid the object of obtaining this kind of help

 

anyway is the elimination of Trujillo and instead of using
arms or grenades, ha began to speak of more exotic materials
and methods." And then it goes on to talk about the powerful
“bomb that could be planted along the route of Trujillo's
evening walk.

Do you see that, sir?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, I do.

Mr. Dennin. Would you agr3e with me that there is no

1 Mr. Dennin. - Now, in Paragraph 2 of the same memorandum,

2 it is stated that these arms would presumably be used against

5 key members of the Trujillo regime?

4 Mr. Bissell. That's right.

5 Mr. Dennin. ‘That's the last sentence of Paragraph 2.

6 And you are aware, are you not, sir, that this memorandum was

in it. I could be wrong about that, but I am almost certain
that he was not.

Senator Schweiker. Mr. Chairman,-I would like to read
the whole paragraph so that nobody accuses me of excerpting
part or parcel of the paragraph. It tells a package, but it
has some names I'd like to ask the witness about. It says,
“Whether or not the zealots received direct orders from the
President or the Attorney General, they did receive orders to
eliminate Castro from power in Cuba. The secret war was a

“result of that policy, and Castro's assassination, if not
specified, was a logical objective of that war., Acting on the
President's authority, JMWAVE trained several thousand Cubans
in geurrilla tactics, armed then with weapons and explosives
‘and sent them down to the Caribbean with hopes of glory. «All
of them sought to end Castro's hold on Cuba, and many of them

made attempts on Castro's life in the impromptu tradition in

Mr. Smothers. Senator, we are now trying to track down

the other addressees on the 13 August memorandum. We have

 

heard from three of them, and one of them is the Ambassador to
Santo Domingo, and we are sending written interrogatories.
Another one, Mr. Wilson, is in today, and we have still another
one who is in South Carolina, and we will be talking with him.

After some further inquiry, it may be necessary, we will
probably have to make a decision whether we will need to. talk
to General Lansdale again. I believe we are already planning
for Mr. Maheu and if we are, we should certainly have that
picture clear in about another week.

The Chairman. Last night, Senator Tower and I met with
the leadership relative to the problem that the Committee faces
with finishing up its work on the assassination issue. It was

the strong feeling of the leadeership that the Committee should

issue a united report and that we should make every effort to

- SUBJECT: ™ Question 3. of. 4 Questions Developed during ssc 7s
- Hearing. of Mr. Richard Bissell on 12 June 1975:

     

“YA CIA ‘able’ (OUT’ 51708, “dated 1’ May 1961) 9 <-
contains a paragraph that certain informa-
tion from another cable or report was to

be withheld from the Department of State.

The Committee question is, What is it that

was to be withheld? Why? Was it actually
withheld and for how long?"

"RESPONSE TO QUESTION 3:
“This answer is based on our assumption that the

Committee's query concerns paragraph two, OUT 51708. iThe

background is this. Consul General Dearborn had instructed
the Chief of Station to determine from CIA whether or not
‘detailed information on plans of the dissidents to undertake

\
the assassination of Trujillo which the Consul General had

 

    

acquired and reported ‘to CIA (IN 44067, 30 April 1961) had
been given to the Department ‘of State. CIA Headquarters.

xveplied (OUT 51708) that the substantive intelligence ;con-

 

cerning the plans and identities of those who, according

to the report ~ articipate had been passed to: ‘the:

   

Department” ‘of: ‘Sted n* ‘L May 1961.5 °° a Bo 7

as paragraph two a query of its own. With parenthetical

that Consul General Dearborn had informed him that

“that CIA Headquarters ask .to plead ignorance if
