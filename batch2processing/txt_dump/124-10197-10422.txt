(2) Mrs. OSCAR ANGULO,

advised upon interview by Bureau Agents, that 3@O
appro#imately 3:05 AM, 1/20/68, she had received a call
at home from an individual whose voice she recognized
as that of ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA. She indicated she was
in frequent contact with BOSCH and was thoroughly familiar
with his voice. The caller asked for ANGULO, and upon
being told he was not at home, stated, "Tell him we put
a bomb on the plane for Merida," referring to the B-25
eargo plane which was destined for Merida, Mexico.
After this statement, the caller hung up. Mrs. ANGULO
advised she received a later call at about 6:50 AM from
a person believed to be the same individual, and she
advised him her husband had gone to the airport. She
also inquired if this s not BOSCH calling, after which
the caller hung up.

 

(3) RICARDO MORALES NAVARRETE, who was arrested
by local authorities on 2/14/68, and charged with one of the
local bombings on 1/25/68, has advised during interviews with
Bureau Agents, that HECTOR CORNILLOT LLANO,. his brother-in-
law, was responsible for the preparation of all anonymous
Cuban Power documents, utilizing the name "GERARDO TORRES
CONTRERAS," however, was not responsible for those signed
"ERNESTO, General Delegate," which leaflets were prepared

- by another faction unknown to him. Since MORALES* release
from jail on bond on the local charge on 3/1/68, according
to the statements of MORALES, ORLANDO BOSCH has sent several
messages to him to the effect that he wants to confer with
him. MORALES is of the opinion BOSCH wishes to confer with
him for the purpose of consolidating the two factions of
Cuban Power.
