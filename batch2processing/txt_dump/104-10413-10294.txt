-LIFEAT continued coverage of Judith FERRETO Segura has provided
a number of leads for possible agent candidates to assess and develop this
Costa Rican Communist exile.

(5) LIFEAT/American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM)

The information provided to the local ODENVY office from the coverage of
David DRUCKER and Charles SMALL (SMOLIKOFT) is most useful to that office
- for covering American leftists and Communists who travel to Mexico. Often
these travellers continue on to Cuba. Their contacts with members of ACGM

are of special interest to ODENVY.

(6) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous As noted in reference the
coverage of a former SMOTH agent is of interest to Headquarters, SMOTH and
the senior ODYOKE official in Mexico. Recent information from this coverage
indicates that this individual is continuing in his literary efforts against
PBPRIME interest.

- . LIFEAT, at Headquarters request, has undertaken coverage of two
targets of ZRKNICK interest. Although the coverage has not as yet been of
sufficient duration to Judge the take definitively, one of these coverages
appears to have potential in providing information of interest,

_ Processing workload of the LIFEAT processor/translator staff remains
“heavy, but no backlog has developed. With the recruitment of LIFEUD-28,
there will be a possible more equitable division of the work for the noted

LIFEUD-28 was granted a POA on 8 July 1963. This agent candidate is

presently being assessed, PRQ Part II will be forwarded at the earliest
possible date.

, (1) LIFEAT/Soviet, LIFEAT has continued its

daily coverage of the home phones of two known Soviet Intelligence Officers.
| This has enabled the interested Station officer to monitor the daily activities
' of these officers including clandestine contacts of one and lately the appar-
; .ent- involvement of the other in an affair with the wife of another Soviet
oh official stationed in Mexico.

t (2) LIFEAT/Polish During the final weeks of

‘| BEKNAVE's stay in Mexico, LIFEAT provided continuing support to the attempted
‘| approach to BEKNAVE. This support included periods of “live-monitoring" the
_target lines to give early warning of BEKNAVE's exact departure plans as well
- as the movements of BEKNAVE. LIV EAT also initiated coverage of the Polish

|. Commercial Office in support of the interested Station officer's attempt to

, gain more information on that installation and the personnel assigned thereto.

(3) LIFEAT/Cuban LIFEAT coverage of two

targets related to the AMSTRUT operation are of great. interest to Ne and
Headquarters. od:
Meskly to these customers. A recent and excellent roundup of aNSTRUTe 8 done
by Headquarters drew heavily on LIFEAT provided information. This roundup
Jwas very well done and greatly appreciated by the Station. During the re-
porting period nothing of interest was obtained from the coverage of the
home of.a Cuban Commercial Attache and it is planned to cut this coverage in
the. near future if it remains unproductive, :

~ | eerning ESLARD-1L's planned travel to both Central America and PBPRIME was

a ion fully reported from this coverage. LIFEAT information enables the Station

‘ mation of his exact departure date and mode of travel.

ven if the crew had then attempted to checkout the routing it would have
been impossible. No direct damage was done to LIFEAT as a result of this
discovery but it was agreed that if possible LIENVOY should assume the
Yugoslav coverage in the future. If such will not: prove feasible, a cool.
off period will ensue prior to LIFEAT attempting to re-establish the note
