- Copies of this communication are being furnished
to Departmental Attorney, Civil Rights Division, United
States Department of Justice at Pine Ridge, South Dakota,
and to the United States Attorney, District of South Dakota,
Sioux Falls, South Dakota,

On April 12, 1973, Gary Rowe Thomas, Attorney,
Legal Aid Services, Fort Thompson, South Dakota, advised
. that he had received uncomfirmed information indicating
that Lillian Richards, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, had been
beaten by Richard Wilson's "Goon Squad" and required
hospitalization,

Richard "Dick" Wilson is the duly elected
President of the Oglala-Sioux Tribal Council,
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, and in this
position he has taken a strong stand against
the American Indian Movement (AIM) and its
objectives. Impeachment action has been taken
against Wilson on numerous occasions by members
of the Tribal Council sympathetic to AIM, and
his removal has been a primary objective of
AIM at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. He and his
supporters, commonly referred to as his “goon
squad", have been the subjects of numerous
civil rights complaints that have been made
during the negotiations at Wounded Knee.
