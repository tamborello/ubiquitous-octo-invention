MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

VIA: Executive Director
Director, Center for the
Study of Intelligence

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: Declassification of Microfilm
in Kennedy Assassination Records

1. This memorandum provides a status report, and
requests your decision on an option to accelerate
declassification (para. 5).

2. As you directed, we have begun reviewing for
declassification the microfilmed records contained in the
collection of materials related to President Kennedy's
assassination. As you recall, we have transferred to the
National Archives all the hard copy documents that were
releasable. The 73 reels of microfilm contain the
equivalent of about 150,000 pages of material, some of which
duplicate the hard copy records.

3. We have assigned all available members of the
Historical Review Group to the task of declassifying the
microfilm. This includes 9 staff officers and 7 annuitants.
With this level of effort we would expect to complete review
of the microfilm within five-six months. The rate of review
is affected by our need to divert resources to examine the
large volume of JFK documents that other agencies, such as
the FBI, are continuing to send us for coordination.

4. You may find the pace of declassification described
above unsatisfactory. Therefore, we present another option
for your consideration in the following paragraph.

5. We have estimated what additional resources would
be needed to permit us to cut the time for declassification
of the microfilm approximately in half. It would probably
require an additional number of annuitants equivalent to 12
full-time reviewers to enable us to complete the task by the
