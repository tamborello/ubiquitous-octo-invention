PRESIDENT. KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION A ZIONIST CONSPIRACY

25 Nov 63

Msg Nr: --

The assassination:of the great President KENNEDY was a shock
to Palestinians. Pleasé,convey our sincere sympathy to the KENNEDY
family and to the people of the United States.

Behind the mysterious crime, is ‘a carefully plotted Zionist
conspiracy. Review of the secret and overt Zionist criminal conspira-
cies against Lord MOWEEN BERNANDOTTE, the Egyptian and German
scientists, as well as the terrorist: method adopted in kidnaping
EICHMAN and many others, provides the’-evidence to question the
position of their secret organizations... _ The late President was likely
to win the coming presidency elections: without supplicating the
Zionist sympathy or seeking the Jews votes, . Aware of the fact that

_ their influence and power in the United States are based upon the
Jews votes, the Zionists murdered the courageous President who was
‘about to destroy that legend of theirs. His asqassetien is a warning
to the rest of the honorable leaders. .

 

Reveal their conspiracy to the supreme judgement of the world,
Be careful, you are the hope of. the Palestinians.
