use KUBARK funds to promote his personal interests and,
consequently, he was terninated in Ucteber of 1959.

6. «ith regard to Subject's assertions as reported in
reference, we wish to comment that:

a. Although we cannot confirm gy controvert nis
status as vice-president of FINA, in April cf 1963 he allowed
.to ODENVY at Atlanta that he was president of Communications
International, Inc. GDENVY pad cohtacted Subject to determine
his possible connection with Or, Elmer Henry LOUGILIn, who
has recently been indiged as an unregistered agent of the
saitian Government.

b. while his claim of past KUTWIN service is true,

_the degree of his friendship with that service's well-known

director remains open to speculation, for there are no
indications that the two were even acguainted.

c. The nature and extent of his relationship with
many important Central American officials is scored by an
episode which occurred in August-September 1962, when he tried
to secure the recognition by several Central American countries
of a Cuban government in exile. In this undertaking, for
example, he offered a Nicaraguan governtent spokesman
$100,000 to secure that country's recognition. And, in
October of 1962,he reportedly tried, through an intermediary,
to purchase used military aircraft in PBPRIME ostensibly for
use in the Dominican Republic to train Latin American pilots
for a thrust against Cuba. /Yn this October report, Subject
is cited as being a forver public reiations representative
here tor the Trujillo reginey7

7. Further to the above, in Cctober of 1962 Subject was
being investigated by GUENVY for his possible involvenent in
1959 in the shipping of arms to Ecuador.

8. The above salient features as to Subject's background,
should be sufficient to discourage any operational use of
subject, and to indicate the need fur cauticn on ReTIniK Ss
part should he have any further contact with him, At the sane
time, deadquarters considers that information on Sub ject*<
local activities and contacts, as could affect ODYOKE interests,
should be reported as such becones known to the Station,

1, In response to the Station's request contained in |
reference for information on -Mitcheli Livingston WER-BELL, IIT, !
this is to provide the Station with sone pertinent personal data |
on him, and to recommend that the Staticn, i.e., Theodore &, KETTNER, |
avoid contact with him in operational matters but, to the extent i
securely possible, monitor his activities in the area. |

2. WER-BELL, born on 8 March 1918 in Phi lade iphia,
Pennsylvania, was married in 1942 to sdildegarde Elizabeth
HEMMERICH, and has six children. He was an Army first lieutenant H
when recruited by KUTWIN, with which service he saw duty with some i
distinction in the China Theater during the second half of 1945,

3. In 1953 he established his own business, Mitchell Werbell
Public Relations and Advertising Company, in Atlanta, Ceorgia,
which went out of business in 1959, due to insolvency caused .
priadrily by his injudicious and unorthodox trade practices.

@ Subject is well-known to KUSARK, whose officers have
categorized him variously as unscrupUlous, a "wheeler-dealer",
and a promoter of grandiose schemes; as a man who lives beyond
his means; and as a high-pressure advertising and promotion

man,

‘S, In the summer of 1959 Subject offered his services to ‘
KUBARK, claiming knowledge of Cuban and Vominican affairs. ‘
Although a POA was granted on 4 August 1959 for his use as a i
source of information on revolutionary activities in the 1
Caribbean area, it evolved that the information he provided was :
of littie value, It was further judged that Subject wished to
