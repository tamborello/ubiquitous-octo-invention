field and it would seem logical that more construction would ‘
occur in the area. Old wiring to the EARL QIEZ residence and
the residence of FRANK | A. NZALES was replaced. by this new
construction and they are served from this same cable. EARL

to their sister CONCHITA. The entire open field is owned by
members of this family.

Puritan Road, shown on the cable diagram. The outlet box was
located on a telephone pole at this location.

The print of the connector circuit entitled "CONNECTOR
CIRCUIT local & toll - 2 digit - terminal per station -
controlled ring" is the print of connections in the company
which would be associated with the subscriber's telephone.

Regarding tests previously made to determine
resistance which would bring up dial tone, these tests
were made on a party line. The telephone company was able
to upgrade the subscriber's service and he was placed on a
private line as a result of the new cable installation.
Instead of the USC type 80 telephone, a white Starlite
telephone with. extension bell was installed for the subscriber.
i The bell rings on a frequency of 30 cycles at 130 volts. LM,
| An emergency power failure generator would furnish 120 volts
at 30 cycles to this telephone.

 

This change to private line service would make
necessary a recheck of the resistance needed to bring up
dial tone. It is noted, however, that the new SPMT} ty device ¥)(V,.
which can be installed in the subscriber’ s hom recently
developed by the FBI Laboratory, would make further resistance *
measurements unnecessary. It is believed that installation of
this device in the subscriber's home other than in the telephone 1
will be more practical in view of the limited space available !
in the Starlite telephone and because the subscriber has several '
telephone outlets in his home where connecting wire would be |
available. :

| Tests to determine the effect of connecting a 3,000-ohm

! . resistor across the subscriber's line were made on both party ~ .

: ; lines using the HSC type 80 telephone and the Starlite telephone

with extension bell. The test on the HSC type 80 telephone. : ‘
revealed that the 3,000-ohm resistor made a very noticeable

change in the ringing sound of the telephone. The ring sounded
muffled. It made no noticeable change in the level of the talk

or listen current at the subscriber telephone or at the calling
party telephone. The same test on an installation where the
Starlite telephone and extension bell were used made no notice-

able difference in the ringi or in talk or listen conditions.

It is felt that the new SPut}aevice would be ideal for use with Bi
the HSC type 80, or the Starlite telephone as compared to the

(Spur Jpreviously available. Gy) :

With regard to information requested in referenced
communication, information has been obtained as follows:

   

Thé normally closed ringing“relay*that will respond
to the ringing frequencies of the lines involved is the
"D Relay" available through the Automatic Electric Company.

. The ringing voltage is 130 volts, as stated above,
with 120 volts available under emergency conditions. Ringing
frequency is 30 cycles.

 

 

The talk voltage is 48 volts with the operating
current dependent upon resistance in the circuit. It was
calculated that the current at the subscriber's line would
be about 54 ma depending upon the position of the carbon ~
granules in the microphone. Actual operating current for
the subscriber's line was not available, but measurements
made on a similar line under actual conditions revealed a
40 ma current when the handset was removed from the hangup
position, .

The two HSC type 80 telephones previously submitted
to the Bureau’ should not be altered and should be returned to) «+
the Tampa Division for return to the telephone company after *
the FBI Laboratory has examined the telephones and made tests
for possible [RFMTTuse as was previously requested. (u)

The telephone number assigned to the subscriber is
WE 8-1209, working out of a substation in Temple Terrace, Florida.
