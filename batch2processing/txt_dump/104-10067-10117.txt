Office of Legislative Counsel

Chief Counsel and Director Co
Select Committee on Assassinations -
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Bob: a
Herewith are comments on the Nosenko draft.

In commencing, it should be noted that Tennent Bagley remains |

under cover, retired abroad. We are obliged to honor that cover, . :

which he has not moved to have modified. ‘lo expose his true

status as a former CIA employée could have repercussions in his

present situation that we must accept as significant. When he

was here in November 1978, he was advised of steps necessary’

to remove his cover, in the event he decided to go overt in this

matter; he took no steps to alter his cover status. It remains 7 '

classified. We therefore request that the example set in the ; . I
’, Hart testimony, of referring. to Mr. Bagley by the title of Deputy : ; i

Chief, SB Division, be followed in this draft. | : . ;

 

Following are detailed comments:
