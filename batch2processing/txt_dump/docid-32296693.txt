Comandos Libres Nacionalistas (CLIN) , is contemplating approaching
JOSE PEREZ-LINARES of the ASI to enlist his aid in obtaining ;
explosivese ; . ;

This information appears to dovetail with information OX
set forth on page 1 of the LHM attached to referenced MM airtel, a i
copy, of which was designated. for Newark. Specifically, the
referenced MM communication reported that a leading figure in

the ASI had disclosed that a secret agreement had been negotiated
between the ASI and 3 other action groups in New York City to coor=
dinate attacks in NYC in the future. Ce

It would appear from the information in re NYtel that
MINGUILLON's group; the CLN, is one of the 3 action groups that
are party to the aforementioned secret agreement with the ASI. The
other two groups are probably the Cuban Nationalist Movement and
Abéala. Moreover, it is noted that the ASI and Abdala are head-
quartered on the same floor in the same building in NYC.
