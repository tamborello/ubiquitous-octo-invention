Oey
1. According to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Lee OSWALD

was at the Soviet Embassy there on 28 September 1963 and spoke with the
Consul, Veleriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV. “\This was learned when OSWALD called ..
the Soviet Enbassy or 1 October, - identifying himself by name and speaking :
broken Russian, stating the above. and asking the guard who answered the phone’
whether there was\ "énything’ new: concerning the telegram to Washington."
The guard checked and then told OSWALD that a request had been sent, but
nothing had as yet beerhgecdived. (MEXI 6453, 9 Octoher 1963) The FBI liaison
officer, Mr. Pappich, told me on 23 November that the Bureau. has reason to
believe that OSWALD's visit was to get Soviet support for .a U.S. passport or

_ visa matter /ferhaps the new passport mentioned in the press articles.

L. BEKRENEV, in a ‘top secret lectus to a Soviet Military Intelligence course
at Military-Dipl c Acodeny, 1960, said,

    
   

"Case offic use as cover, let us say, the Soviet Trade
Representation, TASS or Sovinformburo, can. use their cover “~~
assignments as Kstopping for non-clandestine meetings with
certain agents’) “Whose particular activities officially associate
‘then. with. the ‘previously mentioned Soviet institutions<>. -Howevery.
uch non-clandestine meetings within a legal residenty should be
restricted 40a minimum both as to place end times. Meetings of
Se eee eee She should be be carried out Sees in exceptional See

tes cointerintelligence service ag service adnan Re a eer the ‘Soviet festetletion
rare Sed_as cover. Such meetings are held as a rale in the wo met the work -

offices of the case officer or 2 agent during working hours.

It is nécessary that such meetings be conducted naturally, that - ‘
they do not attract the attention of outsiders, and that the receipt
and transmittal of intelligence matters, properly camouflaged, be
carried out discreetly. In setting up such meetings, measures against
tapoing must be taken. One must bear in mind that a meeting with
persons outside official premises and during non-working hours usually
signifies a relationship ' between the two parties that is above and
beyond official matters."

 

  
    

  

Also, such contact in official dustel ations nay-be caused bythe. sgentis own
carelessusss. Again Admiral BEKRENEV Speaks,

. "Some agents, because of inexperience or ‘because of deliberate
