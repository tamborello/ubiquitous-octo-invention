: As you may be aware, this Committee's relationship with
iMr. Patterson parallels that of the Bureau's. To put it mildly,
;it has not been wholely satisfactory. Mr. Patterson provided
information to the Committee under a promise of confidentiality.
‘He was not a Committee informant in the sense that he received
compensation for the information. Only witness fees were paid
to him. Nevertheless, that he was cooperating with the Com-
‘mittee ultimately came to the attention of the Ray family and
‘Mark\Lane. Apparently, out of a concern for his personal safety,
-he reptdiated his relationship with the Committee and has been
a source of a variety of false charges against staff employees.

I have to assume that the materials in the possession of
Mr. Weisberg were obtained from Mr. Patterson. If I am correct
in this assumption, what was seemingly a release of sensitive
materials to the public by the Committee can be placed in a
proper context.

. I regret that this instance may have caused you any con-
jcern. If my understanding of the facts are correct, in fact
‘nothing has gotten into the public domain through Mr. Patterson's
Yactions that he was not capable of releasing independent of the
Bureau's or this Committee's actions.

. You may rest assured that the Committee will in the weeks
jahead continue to afford that material that you have made avail~
‘able to it all measure of confidentiality. As I am sure Danny
‘Coulson and the other men working with the Committee will assure
‘you, every step is being taken in the development of the final
“report to see to it that the spirit, as well as the tenets, of
the Memorandum of Understanding are adhered to.

Sincerely,

ea

Q Dear Mr. Director: ; oe

3 . Chairman Stokes asked me to respond to your letter of
»% (December 6, 1978 in reference to materials furnished to the
Bureau by the Department from Harold Weisberg.

NY

Ry I, too, share your concern that materials that are of a
Vay [sensitive character not enter the public domain.

NX

Yy f My letter to Mr. Weisberg, of course, is not sensitive,

‘nor are his two letters to me, both of which he apparently re-~
tained copies of.

The other material, a copy of which was attached.to your
letter, constitutes the typewritten notes that one Oliver “Patter-
son gave to the Federal Bureau of Investigation while he was
serving as an informant for the Bureau, providing the Bureau
information on J. B. Stoney. naEdward Fields, and the National
States Rights Party. I do*not know if Mr. Patterson retained l4
copies of the materials he rovided ureau.

P peg a fé Y Ee / YO.

 

in any event, iy the course of thi’ Committee! s investi-
gation of the possible involvement of Stoner and the National
States Rights Party in the assassination of Dr. King, Oliver
Patterson was identified as a possible witness. He was inter-
viewed by staff investigators and he acknowledged that he had
been an informant for the FBI. He also provided to the Com-
mittee a waiver of his confidential relationship with the Bureau.
It was based on this waiver that my letter of January 26, 1978
requested access to Mr. Patterson's informant files, in order
that the Committee could verify Mr. Patterson's present recol-~-"“
lection of events of a number of years ago. I understood, at
the time, that your release to the Committee of these materials:
was done with the understanding that since they stemmed from
Mr. Patterson, it was contemplated that there was ne.ebjeetion «

to Mr. awe having what he had originally given to the
Bureau. 4
