Cuban revolutionary activities for the past four years,
advised GEORGE TANNER, West Palm Beach, Florida, who calls
“A

 

formed the Anti-Gommunist et oaneiree’ an organization
of American adventurers, to participate in some military .
action to overthrow the Cuban Government. TANNER ‘subsequent-
ly set up a training camp in the Florida Keys, where the :
