ROTE:

The extremely sensitive source referred to in instant
letter is NY 694-S%,

Susan Frank and her husband, Richard, are suspected
of being agents for the Chinese Communists in the U. $., not
only by the Bureau but by CP, USA, It appears that liaison with
Chinese Communists is maintained through Israel Epstein and
TANG Ming-chao, who have headquarters in the office of a member
_ of British CP in Londen. fIf-we can persuade British to intensify -
coverage of individuals i ndon, posstiigyy exists, .we may
ultimately learn details re Chinese Communt sts, eetivities in U. $16)
