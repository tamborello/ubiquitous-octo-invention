| ' The Louisville Division, at the present time, is
employing no highly confidential sources in connection with
captioned matter, and none are currently contemplated.

The Louisville Division, through its live criminal |
informants, has maintained a high degree of coverage concerning
operations of the gambling and hoodlum element in Headquarters
City and the Newport-Covington, Kentucky area, among whom and
in which vicinities the "Commission", if active in the Louisville
Division, would be most likely to be operating.
