would discuss was whether they should talk to Sylvia Duran
in Mexico at the Consulate. (Cable Headquarters to Mexico
City Station, April 8, 1964, DIR 13026, CIA No. 698)
Headquarters further cabled that the Warren Commission staf-
fers knew that the Central Intelligence Agency had tap
assets and that they might have guessed from the coverage
that they had photo points and a source in the Cuban Em-
bassy, but that they did not know the details on the Agency's
arrangements with the Mexicans. Headquarters stressed
that the Chief of Station should lend them all the needed

assistance with the minimum possible disclosure of assets

At this point the House Select Committee on Assassi-~
nations has determined that the Central Intelligence Agency Lond”
thought their continuing electronic surveillance operation on ty
extremely sensitive and important. The Warren Commission _s
would have needed to disclose sensitive information to
contradict Sylvia Duran's story. The Central Intelligence

Agency had input into what could go in the Warren Report.
