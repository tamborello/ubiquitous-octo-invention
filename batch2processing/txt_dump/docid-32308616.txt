Madrid 92-7 TORN

:

The. writer questioned the caller at several different te
times as to his identity and each time received the reply that _ '
the caller was the "Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy in Pariet \)

Inasmuch as the Madrid file on this matter reflected
that Assistant. Legat KEENAN had handled coverage on the subject :
in November 1961, -when the subject was in Madrid, through OTHER 4.

of the Directorate General of Security,
actual surveillance of the subject having been arranged by
Mr.[___]with the Alien Brigade of the Directorate General of
Security, Mr. was contacted on 12-22-61 and requested to
verify whether the call concerning the subject and the other '
two individuals had originated with his office or with the '
Alien Brigade. ur. [~~] subsequently advised on the same date H
that the call had not’ come from his office and that he had
checked with the Alien “ottied ley ws been told that no call
|
|
|

 

 

had been made from that offic iS w)
Le

Inasmuch as Mr. HAROLD MOSS, U. S. Treasury repre-

sentative in the Embassy in Paris, had previously expressed
‘an interest in this matter, the Paris Office was telephonically
contacted on 12-22-61 to ascertain whether the information
contained in the telephone call may have originated with

Mr. MOSS. The Paris Office subsequently advised on the same
date that contact with Mr. MOSS and his office in Paris had
failed to develop any information indicating that they were {
responsible for the call. £5 4) ‘ae os |

The Madrid Office is presently endeavoring to verify
through Mr. POZO whether EMIL ARNSTEIN and ROBERT SCHIFF
| actually arrived in Madrid on 12-23-61, it being noted that
| ‘ reference Bureau cable indicated that subject GIANCANA., had
been in Chicago and that there was no indication that he planned
to return to Europe in the immediate futur¢g) Z7(v)

.The Madrid Office file on this matter reflects that
one[L__Jof the Alien Brigade of the Directorate General
of Security was the one who apparently handled the surveillance
on the*subject in November and who reported on .the matter to
Assistant Legat KEENAN. A copy of this letter is being sent
direct to the Paris Office with the request that Mr. KEENAN
advise whether he recalls if the telephone number of the_direct
line in the Madrid Office, 2 26°61 99, was furnished to ww

‘ in the course of his investigation of the subject in Novembeygy>
