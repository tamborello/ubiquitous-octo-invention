The meeting was opened by TAFT.

the rights party and to start clubs wherever possible.
He said there had been a club in Lakeland in about 1960, but
it disbanded.

TAFT stated he will be working all over Florida
trying to get the party set up in every town. TAFT turned

integrate. He stated the Negro has said they will not be ©
