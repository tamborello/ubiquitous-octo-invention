East Grant, Indiana, Pennsylvania. Alsoinoted in attendance :

/ were JOSEPH MALLAMO, brother of DOMINICK, and PAUL and MIKE
ROMEO of Campbell and Poland, Ohio, a11 alleged members of
the "organization". Due to the steady rainfall at the time
of the funeral, no doubt the number of persons in attendance
may have been limited, however, there were about 20 cars in
the funeral’ cortege. ; .

cos Referenced Pittsburgh letter to Bureau, 1/14/64,
captioned "PG 694-PC;. Top Echelon Criminal Informant Program"
and "CAVBOMB", set forth a lead at Campbell, Ohio; for the
Cleveland office to advise whether or not MIKE ROMEO, aka
MIKE ROMANO , was fired upon sometime shortly before CAVALLARO
was dynami ted.

It is noted that PAUL ROMEO of canpibe11 has been
previously reported as being the retired head of the’
"Calabrese Organization" in the Youngstown area, which’.
organization is under the jurisdiction of the "Calabrese —

: Organization" in Cleveland, allegedly headed by TONY MILANO
y and FRANK DE AUGUSTINI. MIKE ROMEO df Campbell, Ohio, is a.
son of old PAUL ROMEO and MIKE ROMEO of Poland, Ohio, is” ”

-. a brother of old PAUL ROMEO. ‘The ROMANO who was fired upon,

~ or an attempt madé to murder him by use of a shotgun, was

JOSEPH ROMANO, aka "STONEFACE", a Sicilian, who was.

seriously wounded following shotgun blasts about his” body”

in the yard of his home on 6/4/60 at Youngstown, ‘which was’

about ak years before the CAVALLARO bombing. ~Informants have
reported that possibly BILLY NAPLES, bombing - murder victim
at Youngstown on 7/1/62, was responsible for the attempt on

ROMANO. ROMANO recovered and. left Youngstown and'moved to

Chicago, Illinois, however, informants & Youngstown havé  —~

stated they have heard that ROMANO is currently spending his

: It is further to be noted that there are two iv
distinct groups in the Youngstown area, the "Calabrese :
organization" and the "Sicilian organization," '

Re lead at Struthers, Ohio, to identify "BILLY SUNDAY"
and evaluate information furnished by informant concérning
him, It is to be noted that the above no doubt refers to
WILLIAM LANTINI, aka "BILLY SUNDAY", who resides at 2005
Glenwood Avenue, Youngstown, and is 65 years of age, i's
naturalized, and a Sicilian by birth. LANTINI has FBI #
22716, and when arrested in the past, has used the names

game in operation h the Youngstown area at the present. time,
and the last that the game operated was on the night of
11/22/62., which was the night preceeding the bombing - murder
of CAVALLARO. The game at. that time was operated in Campbell, - |
Ohio, having been moved from Struthers, Ohio, during the :
latter part of June, 1962, just prior to the bombing
murder of BILLY NAPLES on 7/1/62, It is agreed that LANTINI ;
was connected with the barbut game when it operated, and i ‘i
it appears that he had a connection with each barbut game .
that has operated in the Youngstown area,

PG 694-PC also stated that VINCENT J, DE NIRO,~
‘bombing - murder victim, 7/17/61 bankrolled the Sans Souci

Las Vegas, which closed, and that EDDIE TOBIN, formerly of .
Youngstown, was an employee of the Club. ; ; !

\ Regarding the shotgun murder of SANDY NAPLES ato”
Youngstown, Ohio, mentioned by PG 694-PC that DE NIRO arranged’.
for this murder which occured on 3/11/60; it is to be notéd
that it is the consensus of opinion by Youngstown informants
that NAPLES was murdered because le would not give in to the
