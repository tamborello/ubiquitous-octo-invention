The decision was made. during the same week of 18 Noven-

cently completed their basic radio training. During the December
operation, one of the radio operators, AHAKA-1, vould accompany
AMICE-i4 and the two boatmen, ANTRUNK-7.and ~S,. on the Boston
Whaler to provide rapid communications between the ANTRUNK infil/ — |

     
   
   
     

exfiltration area and JMWAVE. The other radio operator, AMAGREE=1,_
would begin tradecraft training with AMTRUNK-13 in early. December. -
to prepare for a January infiltration. Either or both radio ~~
operators could then be used to provide a communications link with
the infil/exfil area on an operation of short duration or could

‘be infiltrated for a longer period of time to function as com
municator for either AMTRUNK-9 or -10. AMICE-14 will also explore
with both AHTRUNK-9 and -10 the possibility of their recruiting a
qualified radio telegraphist who could be trained in KUBARK'’s sys—
tem of W/? to remain in place. :

In preparation for December, AMICE-14, AMAKA~1, and
ANTRUNK~-7 and ~8 received maritime refresher training and ran
additional tests on the 16' 7" Boston Whaler during the week of
25 November.
