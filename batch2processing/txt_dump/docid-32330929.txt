said he possessed no derogatory“informdtion on BERISIARTU, who
had been a close friend of MANOLO” RAY, “hor is now in.Puerto Rico).

a

Spanish concerning "THE HEMISPHERIC. FREEDOM FUND", and

another report entitled "ACTIVITIES IN THE CUBAN .AFFAIR",
relating to his plan of action against CASTRO. Translations
have been made of both these reports, but neither is being
furnished the Bureau for dissemination in view of BERISIARTU's
very questionable reliability. Lo .

On 3-6-62, BERISIARTU curda bite a typed report in (4)

On 4-12-62, after he refused to produce alleged
handwriting specimens of. CIENFUEGOS as promised by him, he

‘was asked by SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR., if he would be willing

to take a lie detector test. He answered in the negative
stating that‘would be beneath his dignity. \

Attention is directed to his failure to’ produce
evidence after offering to do so, and his unwillingness to
take a lie detector test.

. ‘Ever since the disappearance of CIENFUEGOS in
October 1959, it has been presumed that he is dead. However,
the corpus délicti was never produced nor were any traces of
his companions and his plane ever found.

In view of BERISIARTU's alleged efforts to sell the
rights to this story of CIENFUEGOS to Time Magazine, it is felt
that representatives of that concern may contact the Bureau
for confirmation. :

_ Copies of this communication are furnished Cincinnati,
New York, San Juan and the WFO for information purposes, but
Miami feels that BERISIARTU's allegations are undeserving of

further investigation in the absence of. additional information.

Also, Miami is giving no further consideration to
the development of BERISIARTU as a PSI. ;

In the event the HEMISPHERIC FREEDOM FUND materializes,
this office will conduct appropriate .inyestigation. Translations
of the two reports furnished by BERISIA UY, described above, are
being retained by Miami in this éasei;i); 7
