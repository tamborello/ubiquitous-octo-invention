Title: JFK Task Force

Synopsis: Future electronic communications from the JFK Task
Force (JFKTF) to Criminal Intelligence Division(CID); National
Security Division (NSD), and'the Office of the General Counsel
(OGC) will be to advise what information the Assassination
Records Review Board (the Board) released at their last meeting.
“OPCA rarely will be seeking recommendations for appeals, sincé
the FBI withdrew the foreign counterintelligence appeals in
December 1996. -

Details: The Board began reviewing FBI documents with postponed
information in July 1995. The ;JFKTF provided evidence to justify:
the redaction of information ba'sed on a conservative approach to.
the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 .
(the Act). The Board members were briefed by FBI experts.in the .
areas covering informants, assets, technical devices, and foreign
counterintelligence information. However, once the Board began
their review and advised the FBI of their decisions, it-.was
obvious that the standard legal arguments and claims would not
suffice. The Board made it quite clear that they interpreted the
Act liberally, they were to disclose as much ag possible, and
they would be held accountable by the research community. for
their decisions. _ : Oe

; The Board supported the position that the postponed
information had to be justified on a singular basis for each
informant/asset as to current harm. They opined that the
pertinence and importance to the assassination outweigh any
current harm to the individuals or the FBI/United States foreign

documented releases of information from the same types of
categories, with no noticed harm to individuals or operati

Res 62-HQ-1029205, 03/17/1997

After a thorough review of the information available to the
public, the FBI reviewed its prior position and dropped the
appeals in December 1996. Therefore, there are very few and/or
limited issues significant enough for appeal.

For now the JFKTF will continue to provide evidence for
all informants/assets whether living, deceased or no record
found. Unless an unusual situation arises the Board’s decisions
will be managed the same way, as was decided in the Fall of 1995,
with no appeal of their decision. To be consistent with the
FBI’s December 1996 decision to drop the appeals, the JFKTF will
‘be declassifying documents related to the same issues. That
material still requiring classification will continue to be
justified to the Board.

Therefore, future electronic communications (EC) to
CID, NSD, and OGC will be for information purposes, unless noted
differently. The EC will continue to document the information (ie
names, singular information, source numbers, information from
foreign sources, etc.), but the photocopies of the documents will
no longer be attached. If you have any questions about the
information or documents, please contact Carol L. Keeley at
extension 4-9494, Barbara L. Hatch at extension 4-9482, or
Carl Valentine at extension 4-9476.
