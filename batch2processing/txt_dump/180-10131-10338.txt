Re

Mrs. Scaletti. I went to the Agency, to the office of
Genéral Counsel to find out what my rights were, what restric-
tions were placed on me. They told me I had no restrictions
placed on me and I could have counsel with me today if I
wanted to. .

Mr. Goldsmith. Did anyone in the Agency discuss the
substance of. the testimony with you?

Mrs. Scaletti. No. TI discussed with him only -- they

did not discuss with me what I should say or in any way I could)

say it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Have you spoken to ant present or former
Agency employee about testimony or statements which those
persons have given to the Committee in the past?

Mrs. Scaletti. No, I have not.

-Mr. Goldsmith. Is it fair to say that other than the
interview you had previously with staff members of this Commit-
tee you have not discussed the substance of this case with any-
one?

Mrs. Scaletti. No. Just OGC and OLC about my rights

and procedures, et cetera.
Mr. Goldsmith. Mrs. Scaletti, for how many years were
you employed by the CIA?
. Mrs. Scaletti. Twenty-six plus.
Mr. Goldsmith: What years were you working for the

Agency?
