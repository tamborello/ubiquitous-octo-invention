GUERRIERO, better known as "PIPPY' is auspected
of being a member of the_DE. CAVALCANTE. "Family" in New
Jersey, This suspicion is founded on his close association
with FRANK CARBONE, a known member of this “family" and .
the fact that GUERRIERO'’s car has been observed at meetings
of the DE CAVALCANTE "Family" in New Jersey,

 

 

GUERRIERO has been reliably reported as an
equal partner inia policy operation, with DANNY TEDESCO,
previously described as a protection man for CARBONE.
‘The policy operation is centered in Hartford and N New
Britain, Connecticut, which is a suburb of Hartford.

 

 

 

 

GUERRIERO is known to have the exclusive Negro
numbers action in New Britain. urx naw 101a)2

Jury in June of 1968, and invoked the Fifth Amendment
relative to his gambling activities. .

Y) ANTHONY LA SELVA, a brother of JOSEPH who is a
\./ known _member_and_- _"Underboss._.of the DE _CAVALCANTE...Family",
S) operates the General Automatic Transmission Company in

Waterbury with JOSEPH. Because of his close association
with his brother, JOSEPH, he is suspected as being a member
of the DE CAVALCANTE "Pamily" and this probable membership
is also. borne out by reason of ANTHONY's car being observed
at a meeting of the DE CAVALCANTE "Family" in New Jersey.
