In the opinion of this office, a Neutrality Act

MM 105-2855

During that conference, BOSCH asked MM 639-S to
meet him outside the MIRR office privately. MM 639-S
complied and BOSCH propositioned MM 639-S about serving as .
pilot on a bombing raid in the near future, MM 639-S
expressed interest, and on 3/28/66, BOSCH, accompanied by
M4RCELINO GARCIA JIMINEZ, of MIRR, contacted MM 639-S at
his home and elaborated upon his plans, BOSCH explained that
he had met with a very important man who agreed to pay
B.SCH $1,000 for a small raid and that if it succeeds, this +
man, identity unknown to MM 639-S, would furnish $20,000
to BOSCH for a big raid. BOSCH had charts in his possession
and pointed out to MM 639-S the target, Nuevitas, a sugar
exporting town on the north coast of Camaguey Province, BOSCH 74
said that he would provide a Cuban to serve as bombardier, . \
four 100-pound bombs and money for MM 639-S to rent a plane,
He said that after the raid succeeded, he would make certain
that MM 639-S receives the sum of $1500, for serving as pilot,
B°SCH emphasized that only three people, BOSCH, GARCIA and
"MIMO" (GERVELIO GUTIERREZ CONCEPCION) know about these
plans, in addition to MM 639-S, HQ)

 

 

 

On April 1, 1966, MM 639-S reported that on
March 30, 1966, he accompanied BOSCH and a Cuban known to 4
him only as "GUAJIRO" to Marathon, Florida, in the Keys |
where they inspected the airport and BOSCH decided upon a
plan for the raiding plane to depart from this point for
Cuba, He desires MM 639-S to rent an Aerocommander twin-
- engine plane in the Miami area, fly it to Marathon, Fla,
and land about 5:00 P, M,, on the day of the scheduled raid,
He suggested that MM 639-S leave the plane at a particular
location on this field, go into Marathon, and then return to
the field shortly after midnight, In the meantime, four :
bombs and a Cuban bombardier will have been placed on the oo
Aerocommander, BOSCH explained that the bombs and bombardier
would be transported from Miami to Marathon by car during
the evening hours prior to the scheduled 2:00 A, M,, de=-
parture of the plane on its raid, He implied that he,

himself, would be among’ those transporting the bombs, and
that a station wagon belonging to "GUAJIRO" would be used, HY)

 

. On the night of March 31, BOSCH picked up MM 639~
in a car, and after considerable "dry cleaning" and counter-
a surveillance by "MIMO" and "GUAJIRO," he proceeded to a w)

"Safehouse." Shortly thereafter, "MIMI" and "GUAJIRO"
arrived and exhibited to MM 639-S, a 100 pound bomb (not
loaded) farhis inspection, Four bombs. of similar con-
struction loaded with C-4 are to be used on the raid, C

MM 639-S obtained the license number 1W-47512
(1966 Fla.) of “GUAJIRO's" station wagon, Car is registered
to JOSE ANTONIO MULET, 201 NW 35th Ave., Miami, who is
the subject of a closed file entitled, "JOSE ANTONIO MULET
GONZALEZ, aka,, "Guajiro", IS-Cuba," Bufile 105-121159,
Miami file 105-7736, This file reflects that MULET is
a former employee and confidant of JOSE "PEPIN" BOSCH,
head of the Bacardi Rum Company, who has reportedly, financed
several previous raids, or attempted raids, cc) W :

On the night of March 31, 1966, "GUAJIRO" pulled i
a roll of bills from his pocket and gave MM 639-S a $50.00 i

bill, upon instructions of ORLANDO BOSCH, for his. pre- fi
liminary Services, "GUAJIRO" also paid for the expenses f

: of the trip to Marathon ..(ay) w

It, therefore, appears that "JOSE "PEPIN" BOSCH
may be the financial backer of the MIRR in this plan. & Ww

No specific date has yet been set for this raid,
and ORLANDO BOSCH has told MM 639-S that he can choose the
date since he will be the pilot.@¥ (y ; . :

BOSCH also disclosed that the MIRR has 20 or 25 H
additional bombs of the type exhibited to MM 639-8.) v) . z

Above details have been purposely omitted from
attached LHM in order to protect MM 639-S, who is obviously

in a highly vulnerable postsien YW)
