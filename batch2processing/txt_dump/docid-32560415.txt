viduals for any information regarding the gambling casino
in the Hotel Plaza in Havana, Cuba, primarily as to the

On September 12, 1960 the Philadelphia Evening
Bulletin contained an article captioned "Plan to Haul
Trash on Barges Dropped as Too Costly." In this article
it stated plans to take trash by barge from Philadelphia
to landfill sites along the Delaware River, have been :
temporarily abandoned by the city. It quoted Deputy Streets
Commissioner ABRAHAM MICHAELS as saying that the project
was "neither economical nor feasible at this time."

Ameri¢an Gambling Activities
Havana, Cuba

: As previously reported, ANGELO BRUNO allegedly
had an interest in a gambling casino in Havana, Cuba, with -
a group of New Jersey racket men, some of whom were identi-
fied as CARL PAPPY IPPOLITO, CHARLES TOURIN aka The Blade,
and an individual named DAYLIGHT. It should be noted that
in July 1959 ANGELO BRUNO's wife told a confidential source
of information as previously reported that BRUNO's invest~
ments in Cuba totaled approximately $180,000. In April 1960
BRUNO's wife told the same informant that most of the. money
invested by BRUNO in the gambling casino in Cuba had been
obtained by him but this informant did not knowhow BRUNO
was able to bring this money out of Cuba. This information
was furnished to PH T-6.

Previous investigation has established that
BRUNO is one of the persons interested in the holdings
of the Hotel Plaza gambling casino in Havana, Cuba.

On October 18, 1960, BRUNO advised T-4 that
he had arranged through’ Lloyds of London and an undisclosed
insurance agency to insure his gambling casino in Havana
for an unknown amount. The insurance agent accordi to
BRUNO manipulated the papers so that BRUNO received $180, 000.
T-4 advised that BRUNO was impressed with the insurance
agent's refusal to accept $20,000 for this "favor," T-4
was told that there had been a fire at the gambling casino
after which it was discovered that the insurance premiums
had not been paid at the time of the fire. .T-4 also stated
that MARIO MAGGIO told BRUNO recently that CAPPELLO (phonetic )
had been constantly trying to contact BRUNO about -a
