On this occasion informant learned that BRUNO's
proposed contract with the City of Philadelphia had gone to
the extent that the City Council had appropriated money for
the proposed contract. It was said that BRUNO's associates
in this contract would have to bid for the contract but that
it appeared that. this bid would be only to comply with
formality. It was reported that BRUNO's associates had not
at this time made final payment on the land to be purchased
in Salem County, N. J., where the garbage will be dumped.

On 12/18/59, informant said that he had met with
City Councilman SAMUEL ROSE on.12/14/59 and thought that
in the near future he would have details on the latest
development of ANGELO BRUNO's contemplated contract with
the City of Philadelphia.

On 12/21/59, informant said that he had been
consulted by BRUNO and his associates regarding the securing
of a contract for the City of Philadelphia after conference
with Councilman ROSE. Informant said that it now appears
that the original deal would not go through due basically '
to strong opposition developed near the proposed dumping i
site in Salem, N. J. Informant was reported to have dis-
cussed with ROSE the possibility of handling garbage disposal
and dumping in Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pa., which
according to the informant may have in some way brought about |
the present situation in order that the informant could '
secure the contract for himself. Informant pointed out that 4
if he secured the contract, BRUNO would in no way enter
into the business.

The following information, even though not derived
from a confidential source, is included in this portion 4
of the cover letter as it would have no meaning if included
in instant report without benefit of thepreceding information:

Philadelphia Inquirer 12/23/59 reported that a
"storm of opposition" developed being led by the Mayor of
Bridgeton, N. J., and a State Senator from Cumberland County,
N. J., all opposed to using grounds for the dumping of refuse,
based on the danger to health and loss of natural wildlife.
