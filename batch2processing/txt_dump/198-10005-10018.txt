"Soviet fishing boats, “under cover of ‘fishing Atlantic waters, _
“are transporting contraband arms to Latin American countries.” ":
: The boats are met-outside the territorial waters of those

' countries, and arms are transferred in small quantities.

“. On board the Soviet boats are only Soviets and a very few

Cubans or other Latin Americans who talk with those who
’ pick up the arms. The arms being delivered are of American

manufacture, including those obtained during the Batista
.. regime and those. taken during the Playa Giron invasion. The

‘Soviet fishing boats also carry propaganda. and pamphiets
- containing, military instructions, the same type of material

being .sent by diplomatic pouch from Mexico. :

om

A Belgian in Habana who says he represents: a Belgian ‘firm,
‘- has offered the Cuban Government any type and nationality Joe
. of arms for payment in dollars. The Belgian has made a
. Similar offer of .sale of arms to a representative of an
..anti-Castro group in Habana. - .

- In August 1962 ‘a fisherman in Santiago de Cuba said that
“on several occasions he had been forced by the Government
to use his boat for. transporting small groups of men, in
_ civilian clothes, and supplies of arms. He also knew of

other fishermen who had been forced to do the same. The men
and arms were carried to small islands or transferred to other
boats at sea. Such trips sometimes lasted as long.as four or
five days. The fisherman. did not know the purpose or final
destination of the men and AMS.”
