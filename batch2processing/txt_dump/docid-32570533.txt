near Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, Mr. SHANLEY .
answered that the case was not workable from Miaml
since the subjects at Miami might take no action for
an extended period, and Customs as a matter of policy
did not handle cases involving explosives wherein the
explosives would be under the control or within the
knowledge of Customs and at the same time present the
considerable danger which explosives constitute. He
stated: that the Customs Service makes every effort to
avoid being a party to the moving of explosives, as.
when done by sub jects of a case with knowledge of
