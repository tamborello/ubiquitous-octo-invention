Ancros VEGA Ferez orlitnally desipnated his wife
ang child ag dependents and named another sister
ag Trustee, Information obtained trom AMTIXI aa
and various records available, fLudcdeate that VEGA i
jJearnod that his wife was a GOC follower and directed s
that tho present Trustee, another sister, assume i
control of the money, This could account for the
dincrepancy betweon the amount of money now hold
in trust and the total amount of money paid from ;
1961-1965 since the new trusteeship was not created : }
until much of the money had been spent, In order to {
protect the intorests of the prisoner, some procedure i

‘will probably be dovised by which a long-range
projection can be mado for actuary purposes and the i
trustceship torminated, Recommendations for handling
this case will bo subuwitted to JNWAVE in the near

future,

: 3. In order to arrive at tho exact amount of money to
be saved by tho immedinte and future termination of payments
to certain dependents, a definite criteria must be established
concerning adjustments for secondary dependents when the
first depondent has been terminated, In discussions between
#llen F, MARGANY, during her recent TDY to JMWAVE, and
Mumphrey 0, TIHANUS, it was MARGANY's uuderstanding that the
procedure ia to raise the second dependent to tho status

of firat dependent when the Original first dependent igs
terminatod for cause. For example, the first child would
receive the amount originally paid to the mother, instead

of the customary $50 paid to a second dependent, und the third
dependent would then become the. second dopendont and receive
$50 instead of the original $25, This procedure was not
followed in case # 44 where the second dependent payment
remained at $50 after the remarriage of the mother, Case

# 25 where child, now sole dependent, does not receive full
lst dependent payment, nor in the contentious CUERYO-RUBIO
case (# 54) where an attempt to hold the second dependent

to $50 precipitated considerable unpleasantness. However,
in cage # 86, the procedure of raising the payment level

of the second and third dopendents aftor the remurriage of
the mother, was followed. Logically, the termination of
payments to dependents in any of the top categorios would
automatically lead to an adjustment in status and payment

to not only children, but in some cases parents as well,
! _depending on their position of inheritance. A cedarifteation
: of Station's past proceduro, any known committments to

dependents, and present views as to firm criteria to be

followed in such cases is urgently. requested. Not only is
such a fixed criteria. necessary to determine the Amount of
savings involved in the recommended immediate termination,
and to provide accurate. long-range figures for the actuary
study, but also for the purpose of avoiding any possible
repercussions such ag occurred in the CUERVO-RUBIO case,
