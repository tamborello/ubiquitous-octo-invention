This statement is uninformed speculation. I know
snothir about Mr. WHITE's evaluation of the interrogation of
the DURANs which so far as I know, had nothing to do with the
.etory about “the alleged party subsequently ‘related by Migs’
GARRO. My “belief” was based on the investigation conducted
by this office as reported in Mexico City letter and letterhead
memorandum of 12/11/64, and the Bureau's concurring evaluation
as set forth im Bureau airtel 12/22/65 and Bulet of 2/15/66.

(5) With:regard to paragraph 10 in which Mr. THOMAS
Commented that “whereas the FBI has discounted ELENA GARRO’s
allegations, the.CIA is still considerably disturbed by them":

 

 

ode ; I am aware of no foundations for this observation that
: CIA is “still considerably disturbed" by Mies GARRO's story.
wal My. WINSTON SCOTT gave absolutely mo indication of such reactions
to me, but on the contrary indicated that he was well aware of
. Mies GARRO's unreliability.

 

With regard to Mr. THOMAS’ claim that CIA may not
have pressed further investigation for several reasons including
“considering the sensitive overlap and subtle competition between
two intelligence collection agencies, it had to yield to the
PBI's jurisdiction”:

4 This can only be described as a product of Mr. THOMAS’
: imagination. During the period in question, relations between
thia office and CIA in Mexico were maintained on a friendly,
mutually cooperative basis with respect for the authority and
responsibilities of the two parent agencies. The principal
function of CIA in Mexico in connection with the investigation
of the OSWALD case was in checking out allegations concerning
possible Cuban aspecte through their established sources and
confidential converage. The remaining pointes covered by Mr.
THOMAS under items 2, 3 and 4, paragraph 10, are extransous
to Mies GARRO's story and appear to have been included
gratuitously in his memorandum to the Secretary of State.

(6) With regard to Mr. THOMAS’ terminal comment in
paragraph 13 that the records should show that a representative
of a major American publication has at least some knowledge of
Mias GARRO’s story:

This office has no information indicating such to
be a fact or that either Mir. THOMAS had given the story to euch
an individual. or that Mise GARRO herself, in spite of her .

‘ repeated ‘protestations that she should not be revealed as the

source of this information, had passed the story on to such an
individual. :

Comments

The significance is not known as to why the State
Department disseminated Mr. THOMAS' memorandum under the subject
“CHARLES WILLIAM THOMAS", instead of under the LEB HARVEY OSWALD
investigation as Mr. THOMAS captioned his memorandua.

It appears that Mir. THOMAS has undergone a change in
attitude since his departure from Mexico which is difficult to
understand. This may poesibly be a reaction to his separation
from Foreign Service. According to Embassy sources, Mr. THOMAS
ig believed to have been “selected out", a phrase used when an
officer is “retired” after having been in one gradé for. the
maximum period of time and is not considered qualified for
promotion to a higher grade. This involuntary separation from
the Foreign Service may account for his present attitude which
otherwise ia difficult to comprehend.

During the time after I took over as Legal Attache on
12/16/65 until bis departure from Mexico in 1967, I and other
personnel of this office had very limited contact with Mr. THOMAS
He was one of various officers assigned to the Political Section
and although he was ostensibly friendly, his aseignment had
Little in common with the work of this office and therefore our
relations, both official and persenal, were closer with other
officers in the Politien] Section. The only official contact
I bad with him was in conmection with instant matter. Although
at that time he exhibited somewhat of a “detective complex” in
desiring to probe into the story recounted by Mies GARRO, he at
no time demonstrated a desire to take over the OSWALD inves tiga-
tion from the authorized authorities.

©

Myr. THOMAS’ current attitude as set out in his letter
and menorandum to the Secretary of State dated 7/25/69 is obvious
from his statement, "Since I waa the Eubassy officer in Mexico

memoranda were sent.on-a circulation basis te Mr. THOMAS’
superier, the Counselor for Political Affaire, who also had
received a copy of Ir. THOMAS’ memoranda. It can ‘only be
concluded ‘that’ the ‘Counselor for Political Affairs did net’
route this office's memorandum of 2/23/66 to Mir. THOMAS or
that Mr. THOMAS doos not recall it.

(3) Regarding paragraph 6 concerning Mr. THOMAS’
interview with me relative to Miss GARRO again having changed
_ the date of the alleged party to the end of September ;

I never interviewed Mr. THOMAS alone. The firat time
I saw him was in the presence of Mr. SCOTY., When he visited
my office I called the Agent to whom the case had been asasigned
to come in and sit in on the interview. I did not tell his that
Mise GARRO had given the late September date “accurately” when
' @he had come to the Enbassy and made her first report. I did

there were no Americans there. Frankly, although I had reviewed
the file after this matter firat came up in December 1965, I
did not memorize all of the details and I did not recall this
fact which I did not become aware of until my current review
im connection with Mr. THOMAS' recent allegations. Neither did
I tell him that I considered the case “closed”. I would not
have considered it to be of concern to him whether the case was
eloged or not. I did tell him in response to his inquiry, that
it would not be necessary for him to pursue this matter any
further with Hiss GARRO since we had heard her story before and
it had been checked out without being substantiated and I
therefore considered her story to be a clased iasue.

(4) Regarding paragraph 9 in which Mr. THOMAS referred
to Mr. ALLEN WHITE’s alleged statement that the Federal Security
Police’ interrogation of the DURANs was unsatisfactory and
coment, “This transcript may be the source of Mir. FERRIS’ belief
that ELENA GARRO'’s story had been checked’out and found to be
untrue”:

._ Gi) With regard to paragraph 3 in which he refers to
his meeting with me and Mr. WINSTON SCOTT, then head of CIA,
Mexico: ; ;
: I first met Mr. THOMAS, one of the officers assigned

to the Political Section of the Embassy on 12/17/65, the day
after I took over as Legal Attache, when Mr. SCOTT told me he

had received a memorandum which he believed I should see. It .
was Mr. THOMAS' memorandum dated 12/10/65. As originally prepared
that memorandum was designated for the Ambassador, ithe Deputy
Chief of Mission, the Political Section, Political Researeh (CIA),
and the Central Biographic Department. He subsequently furnished
this office a copy although that dissemination does not show on
the Babassy file copy of his memorandum. In view of the nature
‘Of the ‘information, Mr. THOMAS was asked to join Mr. SCOTT and

me in a conference. Since the investigation of the OSWALD case
had been handled by a previous Legal Attache, I remained non=-
committal about the allegations made by Miss GARRO, but pointed
out the Bureau's interest in that case. It was algo pointed out
to My. THOMAS that the information in his memorandum was in-
complete in many respects, including the fact that Misa GARBRO did
not pinpoint the date of the alleged party but described it only as
“in September 1963, shortly after her return from Europe". He
stated that Miss GARRO was extremely reluctant: to discuss the
matter and doubted that she would discuss it with anyone else.

He therefore volunteered to raise the subject again with her to
obtain more details. He was thanked at that time for his
cooperation.

 

(2) Regarding paragraph 5 in which Mr. THOMAS stated
“he got no reaction from Messrs. SCOTT and FERRIS regarding hia
menorandum of 12/26/65":

In view of the expressed interest of the Ambassador and
the Deputy Chief of Mission whe had received copies of Mr. THOMAS'
mmnoranda of 12/10 and 12/25/65 in the factualness of Miss GARRO's
story, they were advised by memoranda from this office dated
S 12/27/65 and 2/23/66, copies of which are enclosed, that in view
ot of the fact that Miss GARRO’s allegations had previously been

1 checked out without substantiation, no further action was being
taken concerning her recent repetition of those allegations. These
memoranda were based on Buairtel 12/22/65 and Bulet 2/16/66. Both

Background WHERE GHC z.

ELEMA GABRO DE PAZ, or Migs GARRO as Mr. THOMAS calls
her, ig a weil known figure in Mexican political, social and
literary circles. She was a playwright and well known to many
officials of the Embassy including the them Ambassador FULTON
FREEMAN, the then Deputy Chief of Mission CLARBNCE A. BOONSTRA,
and many others. All of those officials expressed to me on.
various occasions the opinion that Mies GARRO is a very interesting
person and a scintillating conversationalist, but that she has a
vivid imagination and frequently appears to be unable to distinguish
| between truth and fiction. Although interesting, they all considered
her as highly unreliable as a source of information except for
|

Mr. THOMAS who apparently placed coneistent credence in what Misa
GAR3O said. ;

merely been introduced at the party as "ALEJANDRO", was made on
the basis of correspondence received by her daughter from ARIO

ALEJANDRO LAVAGNINI STENIUS after the party.. Miss GARRO was

“dinsiatent “that-her daughter had ‘not ‘mét that young man prior
te the party. When it was pointed out te her that the letter
froma ARIO ALEJANDRO LAVAGNINI STENIUS was dated 9/1/63 and
postmarked 9/2/63, she merely commented that probably the
couminists have facilities for falsifying postmarks.

When LAVAGHINI was interviewed, he was unable to fix
the date of the party but he believed it was probably early in
September and neither he nor the two acquaintances of his who
accompanied him to the party could recall any Americana having
been present.

On 12/10/65 while talking to former Foreign Service .
Officer CHARLES W. THOMAS, Mias GARRO claimed that the party
where she had met OSWALD was held at the home of RUBEN DURAN
“in September 1963, shortly after her return from abroad” as
reported in Mr. THOMAS' memorandum of 12/10/65,

In her conversation with Mr. THOMAS on 12/25/65 as
reported in his memorandum of that date, Migs GARRO claimed that
she believed the party wag about September 2 or 3, 1963, "a few
days before the visit of Soviet astronaut GAGARIN"

Inagmuch ag the Bureau is in possession of all of Mr.
THOMAS’ memoranda concerning ELENA GARRO DE PAS’ story except
his memorandum of 12/10/65 (his memoranda are dated the date of
his conversations and net the date typed), copies of that
nenorandum are enclosed herewith for the completion of the
Bureau's files. The Bureau will note that all the pertinent
information contained therein is set forth in Mexico City cable~

“CACHITA" "ke PROENZA DE ROJAS, ‘complained that Cuba has

become a police state and that Cuban authorities have the
family "all tied up." ROJAS and his wife told MEX 197. that
a Cuban communist named JUAN MARINE is a friend of the family.

“On one trip to Cuba, CACHITA, ROJAS asked him to look into the

situation of her sister TERESA PROENZA to see how it could

* be straightened out, MARINE recently visited Mexico "incognito" -

and informed the ROJAS that.the situation now is extraordinarily
good but that TERESA was once under a death Sentence because
she had dealt with LEE HARVEY CSWALD while assigned to the

‘Cuban Embassy prior to the assassination of JOHN F, KENNEDY.
- Her friends interceded for her and her life was spared, ROJAS

told MEY 197 that MARINE warned them not to tell the Cuban -

Embassy in ilexico city that he had spoken to them about this

matter. . .

‘The source stated that JORGE ROJAS and his wife

7 de not know how to cope with the present situation. They

fear going to Cuba and they are speaking out against the Cuban
‘revolution in a most forthright manner. The bitterness dis-
played by ROJAS! wife far exceeds any ‘that the source :
can recall in the. past.

“The source stated that some years:ago, as best he
could recall, he heard JUANA LUISA PROENZA, a sister of CACRITA
who died some years ago, telling a similar story of how TERESA
PROENZA was somehow involved with LEE HARVEY OSWALD at the
Cuban Embassy. At the time TERESA was employed at the embassy,
she lived with JUANA. ‘LUISA and another sister, Within the

family it has always been said that JUANA LUISA worried herself -

to death after TERESA was ordered to Cuba,

The Mexico Sity Cffice has conducted a review of
“references to TERESA PROENZA: especially those dealing’ with the *
OSWALD investigation and it “is noted that as set forth in
Mexico City letter to the Bureau 1/24/64 in. the CSWALD case

MEY 18 and MEX 19, both of whom have furnished reliable infor- |

mation in. the past, reported on 1/13/64 that they had conversed.
with ELIZABETH CATLETT MORA, Bufile 100-395934, who told them
of a conversation she held with TERESA PROENZA, the Cultural
Attache of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. According to
MORA, TERESA PROENZA had told her that OSWALD walked in "cold"
to the Cuban Hmbassy and the first person he talked to was
PROENZA. Since PROENZA did not speak English, she turned him

for a visit to Mexi¢,
in 1/64, . .

- -. By report "dated 1/14/65 the CIA reported on the in-

vestigation by the guban government of old line communist
JOAQUIN ORSCSUI MESA. In this report it was indicated that
TERESA PROTNSA had been arrested at her home and was being
held incommunicado, :

 

A review of the foregoing material indicates that

TRRESA PROENZA got into trouble with the Cuban government more
-as a result of her criticism of the handling of the CSWALU

matter following the assassination of President XENNEDY than
because of anything: she did when OSWALD visited the Cuban
Embassy. Her harsh criticism of nigh Cuban officials (the
bwbassador and Foreign. Minister) was apparently well isnown

in the embassy and hardly helped her case. it fails to
_d4ndicate that she cid anything for CSWAL)? that would substantiate
the remarks made by JORG® NCJAS and his. wife. to Max 157 that
TERESA PROENZA had nearly. been.executed because of her activities
during CSYALD's visit to the Cuban’Embassy in 1963.. In the
absence of additional information regarding this activity, no
further investigation is contemplatec at this time. it is

noted. that it is not féasible to directly interrogate JORGE
RCJAS or his wife. However, MBE 197 will closely follow this
matter with then and any additional, significant developments
will be called promptly to the attention of the Bureau.
