| MEMORANDUM FOR: Special Assistant to the Associate
Deputy Director for Operations

| FROM: Frank Most
HRG Senior Review Officer

SUBJECT: Organization Crypts in the JFK File

‘1. The cryptonyms listed below appear frequently in
‘the Oswald 201 files and the JFK collection. It is not

| unusual for the delection of these crypts to be the only:
‘sanitization in the text of the documents. Each crypt is
‘inactive (cancelled), and some have been publicly exposed.
According to your memorandum on "Release of JFK
‘Assassination Records" dated 25 June 1993, “if the crypt has
‘been retired, does not relate to existing or another project
‘and does not contain a valid digraph," it may be released in)
‘some cases. These cryptonyms meet the criteria set forth in
‘your memorandum and, under the JFK Assassination Records Act
‘of 1992, are not protectable.

Ze As part of the rereview of the "Denied in Full" and
‘"ganitizeda" documents in the JFK Collection, HRG will be
‘releasing the following crypts:

. 1. . KUBARK - CIA
2. KUDOVE - Clandestine Services
3. KUDESK - counterintelligence Division
4. GPFLOOR - Oswald
5. GPFOCUS ~- Kennedy, Robert F.:
6. GPIDEAL - Kennedy, John F.
7. ODACID - State
