Mr, JOHNSON said that the late President had inspired humanity
with fresh hope, which he sheared with 2 new generation of world
leaders. KENNEDY had addressed himself to the future, and
wanted to forget the disunity of the past. The world should
follow his example. :

It is true that the world knows more about how to destroy
itself than how to live together in understanding, but the
United Nations has been too successful for one to despair of the
future. President JOHNSON pointed to successes in the Congo
and Middle East, to the slowing of the arms race, to ‘the progress
of decolonization, to the furthering of human rights: The
United Nations should provide opportunities for constructive
action and not become a platform for name-calling.

The President does not desire only bilateral assistance to
underdeveloped countries, but lays great stress on collective
international action. Just as he wishes to create the impression
among Americans that he is liberal and progressive, so did he
take this opportunity to convince the Assembly that he is deeply
interested in the fight against illiteracy, poverty, and disease.
Just as 30 years ago under ROOSEVELT he helped eliminate poverty
in America, so does he now wish to contribute to the elimination
of misery throughout the world.

Above all else, however , he sees his task as the maintenance
of peace. Thanks to KENNEDY, the world has become a little
' safer and the road to the future a little easier, The’ greatest
tribute one can pay to President KENNEDY is to continue his work
for a peaceful future. On this note the new President; ended his
brief, reassuring speech.
