MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: RODRIGUEZ, Emilio A.
ferbuhe

1. Ellin Glenn, Executive Secretary, HMAB, contacted the writer
to determine whether or not the Intelligence Medal of Merit awarded
the Subject could be released to his immediate family now that the
Subject is deceased.

2. As will be noted from the file, Rodriguez has been involved
in covert activities with the Agency under one cover or another for
a number of years. The Central Cover Staff (Tom Strange) was asked
to provide the Office of Security with a "reading" of whether or not
there was an objection to presenting this award as requested.

3. On 29 November, Hi Steele, Benefits and Services Division,
Office of Personnel, brought for the attention of EAB a BEC claim
being processed in behalf of the Subject's widow, a claim which
alleges that the rigors and tension of the activities carried on by
Rodriguez probably caused his fatal heart attack. Steele stated he
had been in discussion with members of the family, and the Subject 's
sons, who are aware of the award, had asked him if it might now be
released.

kh, The Central Cover Staff reported that a contact with the
WH Division and a thorough discussion of the case had led to a de-
cision that the award should not be released to the Subject's family
at this time ~- primarily as a safety measure due to the very sensi-
tive activities in which Rodriguez had recently been involved. All
parties are aware of the security consciousness of Rodriguez's family
put feel that the added factor of safety in this case is perhaps the
better judgement.

5. The writer has informed Ellin Glenn, ES/HMAB, and Hi Steele
of the decision and has suggested a recheck of this case in one year.
