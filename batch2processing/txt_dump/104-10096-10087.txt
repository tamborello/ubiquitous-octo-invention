LA CO/ 207-7

MEMORANDUM FOR:  SA/ADBO

 

FROM: Raymond A. Warren
Chief, Latin Awerica Division

SUBJECT : SLHORIZON-1 Report Mentioning Cuban
Minister-Counsellor Statement on the
Assassination of President kennedy

REFERENCE: LA/CO/235-77 Dated 30 September 1977

1. The referent memorandum reported information from
a ZRWAHOO intelligence report of a statement made by the
Minister-Counsellor (MC) of the Cuban Embassy in Kingston,
Jamaica, on 24 September 1977, that "Cuban exiles such as
DIAZ Lan (fnu) (sic) and others had been involved in the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy." We believe
that this could refer either to Pedro DIAZ Lanz, or his
brother Marcos DIAZ Lanz, formerly Chief and Deputy Chief,
respectively, of the Cuban Revolutionary Air Force. Both
entered the U.S. from Cuba as exiles in mid-1959. Since
that time the DIAZ Lanz »Srothers reportedly have heen
closely associated with, and involved in numerous activities
with, Frank STURGIS (aka FIORINI) of Watergate fame. The
Agency assisted in the evacuation of Marcos, and Pedro
entered the U.S. on his own. Alithough both were debriefed
by the Agency, there is no indication that they were ever
considered Agency assets.

2. Kingston Station queried source for further infor-
mation as promised in paragraph 4 of the reference. The
source said that the MC referred to the Kennedy assassina-
tion during a pep talk to party members to maintain good
security. Further, that the MC said that "recent infor-
mation had arrived" implicating DIAZ Lan (fnu)} (sic),
former air force officer, in the Kennedy assassination
but did not mention any other Cuban exiles by name or give
any further details. Although the MC did not identify the

 

 

source of his information, source had
the impression that the information might have heen included
in a cable from the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ‘The
source is unable to elicit further information from the MC
without jeopardizing his security. *
