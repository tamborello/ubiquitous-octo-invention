Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am writing on behalf of Director Louis J. Freeh to
inform you of the status of the FBI’s response to the "President
John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992"
(the Act), and to provide projections regarding completion of the
work that remains to be done pursuant to the Act. This is an
update from Director Freeh’s letter to you of November 24, 1993,
and a reiteration of much of the information conveyed to
Legislation and National Security Subcommittee (LNSS) Staff
Director James C. Turner by FBI JFK Task Force Director Terry T.
O’Connor in a meeting on June 14, 1994, and a telephone
conversation on June 20, 1994.

The FBI has maintained its commitment to a speedy and
full response to the Act and, to date, has transferred 463,395
pages of JFK documents to the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA). This represents almost half of the nearly
one million pages of assassination-related documents that the
Task Force can now estimate have been in FBI files. The files
that have been transferred include all Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack
Ruby, "related subjects" (e.g. Marina Oswald), and Warren
