; 2 The address Grazhdan-

rather large spartaent building in
Leningrad. .

variations thereof) listed in the
1961 Leningrad Telephone Directory,
one A.A. PRINISEV is listed for the

of Leningrad, at the rest home
near Leningrad. Marina advised .
that PRIZENTSEV had "an amorous
interest in Irina VOLKOVA /q.v./

sided in a three-room apartment at
Kondrat'yevekiy Prospekt 63, Apt.

the 1961 Leningrad Directory is
one A.K. IVANOV who is listed with
