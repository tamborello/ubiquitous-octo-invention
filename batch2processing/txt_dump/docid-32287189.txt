In view of the foregoing, it appears that the same
individual who constructed the two-bombs recovered in Ottawa
may be identical to the individual who constructed the
electronic firing device in the BOSCH cases

The following investigation was conducted:

MM 1337-S, who furnished valuable information in
the BOSCH case, recalled that on one occasion BOSCH introduced
him to a Cuban exile who was employed at Thurow Electronics,
located at N. W. 23rd Street and 18th Avenue, Miami, and
indicated that this individual was responsible for constructing
the firing device used on BOSCH's Poms «4 (U, J

On May 22, 1972, Mr. HAROLD BELINKY, who operates
Thurow Electronics, which is a subsidiary of Lykes Electronics,
searched his records and advised that JESUS GARCIA, 95
Ne. We 117th Street, Miami, a Cuban exile, Social Security
Number 261~-74-4530, worked for him as a driver from January
11, 1968, to February 29, 1969, and is now | emphoyed by Atlas
TV, Miami Beach. ;

On May 24, 1972, INS records revealed that JESUS —
GARCIA FERNANDEZ, Alien Number Al2 490 266, born January 31,-
1936, Havana, Cuba, Social Security Number! 261-74-4530,
resides at 95 N. We 117th Street, Miami,

GARCIA resided at 431 Audubon Avenue, New York
City, from February, 1963, to October, 1965, and at. 561
West 187th Street, New York City, from October, 1965, to .
November, 1966.

This file disclosed that he was a member of the
Movimiento Insurrecional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria
(MIRR). This is the organization of which ORLANDO BOSCH
was the leader. The file also reflected that GARCIA informed

INS at time of his arrival in the United States on September
9, 1961, that he had worked for RCA in Havana from 1947 to
1953, after CASTRO took over and while serving in the Cuban
militia he became a member of the underground anti~CASTRO
organization known as Triple A. His immediate chief was .
JORGE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ, who had been an ex=Major in the
Revolutionary Army (GONZALEZ was one of the defendants in
the BOSCH case and is now serving a prison term), GARCIA
told INS that he was involved in various acts of sabotage
and destroyed a valuable piece of machinery while he was
working for the Compania Litographia de Cuba before seeking
asylum in the Venezuelan Embassy when he learned that the
Dier (Cuban Intelligence) was searching for him. ,

A photograph of GARCIA was obtained from INS and
on May 24, 1972, MM 1337-S identified this photograph as-.
being identical to the individual to whom he had been
introduced at Thurow Electronics by ORLANDO. BOSCH, Ox(u) .

This photograph refreshed the recollection of
MM 1337-S and he was then able to relate the following

information uC (u) , . |

* Somet ime during the early part of 1968 BOSCH asked
MM 1337~S to drive him to Thurow Electronics, MM 1337-S :
complied and when they arrived at this establishment BOSCH
got out and went inside alone and returned about five minutes
later with GARCIA. When introducing GARCIA to MM 1337-S,
BOSCH stated, “This is the professional electronics technician
who manufactures the bombs," GARCIA then said to BOSCH,
"ORLANDO, don't forget we need the relay. Place a call to
ORLANDO MIRANDA.” BOSCH turned to MM 1337=S and said, "I
need your address so that the relay can be sent to your

_ address, for security Teasons. ‘yd Uy)

Subsequently, MM 1337+S received the relay and it
was subsequently turned over to BOSCH. ae)
