to CIA solely or jointly. The tasks have been reviewed by this
Agency, and it has been determined that substantially all reporting

and planning deadlines can be met. Work on all tasks, with and °

 

 

 

without assigned dates for completion, is in progress. The
following detailed observations are keyed to General Lansdale's

of 15 February. Because communication with singleton agents is

of the Cuban regime whose personal characteristics indicate he
