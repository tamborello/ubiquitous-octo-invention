Re: Status of CLA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

Iam writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board’s requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have’been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

‘As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

**CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City Station.

The Review Board has for some time been attempting to determine whether it
has had access to all of CIA‘s surveillance “take” from the Cuban and Soviet
facilities in Mexico City at the time of the Oswald visit and in the immediate
wake of the assassination. On numerous occasions, the Review Board has asked
whether there was any surveillance take in addition to what is currently in the

collection.

On March 18, 1997, the Review Board provided additional leads to CIA to assist
it in answering these questions. The DO has agreed to check Headquarters
records for the file referenced in HMMW 12454, to search for the crypts cited in
this document, and to search for HMMA 20307 and other cables or dispatches
cited in this document. The DS&T will query its offices for possible records on
Mexico City and Cuba and for the t location of Staff D records. Regardless
of the outcome of these particular searthés, the Review Board continues to seek a
full accounting for all surveillance conducted during the relevant time periods.
