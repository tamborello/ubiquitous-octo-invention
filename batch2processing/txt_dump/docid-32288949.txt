TRAFFICANTE prior to going te Cuba in the 1950's
spent all of his time in Tampa and all of his four brothers
and long time associatés continue to reside in the Tampa area
and the allegations persist that TRAFFICANTE receives a cut

' from all gambling operations in Tampa and South Florida. Tampa

does. not at this time have a source sufficiently versed in :
TRAFFICANTE activities to be able to predict TRAFFICANTE's
location at any given time. According to member sources. in
addition to TRAFFICANTE there are two other identified LCN
members in the Tampa area identified as ARTURO MISURACA, aka
Art Price and GIOVANNI (JOHN) MISURACA, To date no informa-
tion has been developed ‘which would indicate any association
between MISURACAS and TRAFFICANTE or TRAFFICANTE's brothers.
Investigation has. shown some association between ARTURO

- MISURACA and. TRAFFICANTE associate TOMMY SCAGLIONE.

In the Miami area TRAFFICANTE has been known to
associate with STEFANO ANTHONY RANDAZZO,- an LCN Cleveland
family member; THOMAS ALTAMURA, member of the ‘CARLO GAMBINO
"family"; JOHN PHILLIP CERONE, SR., a member of the Chicago
"family" and AGOSTINO Amato, *captain" in the GAMBINO ."family.

~ Bureau requested ‘to grant Omaha. authority to permit:
ou 148~C-TE: to travel to, Florida for the express purpose of

making contact with TRAFFICANTE and. eliciting such “information .

as possible: ‘from such ‘contact.

Tampa prefers that such’ ‘contact be first attempted

in: the Tampa | area in the view of: the following ::

4

re a “TRAFFICANTE' 's long time residents .in- the Tampa
‘area and the assumption that persons who might be members of
~bis "family" would be his associates residing in the Tampa
area and possibly. his ‘brothers: .

2.- Allegations that TRAFFICANTE controls all .
gambling action and juke box operatinns in the Tampa area.
However, Tampa is of the opinion that if Bureau grants Omaha
such authority, Omaha should discuss with OM 148-C-TE the
possible approaches to TRAFFICANTE and allow the informant -
to suggest whether his approach should be attempted in 1 the *
Miami or “Tampa area. , ;

TP 92-1

In addition to the possibility of contacting
TRAFFICANTE in either the Miami or Tampa area informant
has indicated a close association with CHARLES C, HUTTER,
aka Snooks, JK File 92-31, Bufile 92-3489 who is currently
operating a Used Car lot in the Daytona Beach, Florida area
and who is reportedly a representative of NICK CIVELLA.
Therefore possibility exists that the informant could use
the desire to visit HUTTER as his excuse or reason for
traveling to the Florida area.

If the Bureau does authorize such a trip “omaha .
is requested to advise@Jacksonville, Tampa&xand Miami as
to the suggested or adopted procedure to be used by the
informant. It is further suggested that if such trip is’ _
authorized informant should meet with SAS JOHN A. AMBLER mee,
of Tampa and WENDELL W, HALL of Miami, both of whom are a
assigned to SANTO TRAFFICANTE before his attempted contact ™
with TRAFFICANTE and it is suggested that such meeting take
place in a.locality removed from Tampa and Miami.
