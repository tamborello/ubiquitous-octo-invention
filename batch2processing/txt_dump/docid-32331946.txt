ADMINISTRATIVE

SALLY KRAJCIK, 1515 Lincolnway West, Wooster, Ohio,
advised SA VINCENT R. NAPOLI on April 2, 1959, after viewing
a photograph of MAZIL HANNA, aka. Daniel Hanna, that she had
never seen him before and has never heard his name mentioned
by LOUIS MARTINEZ. She said she had no information about him
which would indicate that he was an associate of MARTINEZ,

In regard to the letter postmarked August ll, 1958,
which she sent to LOUIS MARTINEZ, c/o Ponce de Leon Hotel,
Miami, Florida, regarding an "$800 deal", KRAJCIK informed
that letter referred to a personal matter in which MARTINEZ
was not personally involved. She said the letter had nothing
to do with the issue at hand in this case, namely the theft
of the weapons from the Canton Armory, and she stated she did
not want to disclose the facts to which she referred in the
letter. She added that no one that has ever been previously
mentioned by her or to her in this case has anything to do
with the "deal" she referred to in the letter, pointing out
that this letter was written far before the date the theft in
instant case was committed.

In regard to MARTINEZ, KRAJCIK stated that from
January 4, 1959, to approximately January 30, 1959, he
was staying in Cuba at the Havana Hilton Hotel. She remarked
he called her either two or three times from there just to
say "hello", She stated that she had no other contact with
him during that period but recalled that on March 17,°1959,
at 11:00 PM, she was watching the late news broadcast on

-KYW-TV, Channel 3, Cleveland, Ohio, when she heard the com-

mentator mention that LOUIS MARTINEZ of Canton, Ohio, was in
jail in Havana, Cuba, because of failing to pay his hotel
bill at the Havana Hilton.

She said this news was a surprise to her, and the
next day she went to see MARTINEZ! brother in Canton, Ohio,
to find out more about it. His brother said he didn't know
any of the details and was going to try to find out what had
happened,

Continuing, KRAJCIK informed that on March 22, 1959,
at'11:00 PM, she received a call from MARTINEZ asking her to.
pick him up at the Cleveland airport at 6:00 AM on March 23,
1959, as he was returning to the United States on that flight.
She said she met him as he asked and returned to-.Wooster, Ohio,
where MARTINEZ borrowed her car to go to Canton, Ohio. At
that time he explained to her that someone named "MORGAN" from
somewhere in Ohio, who was .in Cuba when MARTINEZ was there,
and who evidently had some connection with the present Cuban
administration, had reported MARTINEZ as a "phony" and traitor
to CASTRO, thereby causing him to be jailed and charged as-
being anti-CASTRO. He also informed her that CASTRO himself
got him out of the trouble, and somehow MARTINEZ was able to
raise the money for the hotel bill.

Continuing, KRAJCIK informed MARTINEZ stayed in
Canton until the following Wednesday, March 25, 1959; when
he went to New York City, supposedly on "business" and to
see someone named "RIFE" (phonetic). She said she again
heard from him the following Sunday, March 29, 1959, at which
time he asked her to meet him at the PRR Station, Canton,
Ohio, at 10:00 AM, She said shé met him as he asked, and he
continued to stay in Canton and contact her periodically.
She said she last heard from him by phone on the evening of
April 1, 1959, at which time he said he would be going to
New York City at 3:00 PM on April 2, 1959, again on business.

KRAJCIK said MARTINEZ is financially embarrased,
and he is trying to promote some sort of bond scheme to raise
money. She said she understands from him and. from a recent
article appearing in the Canton Times that MARTINEZ is in
good standing with CASTRO, .
