in the downtown New Orelans area during which tme thre was little
conversation other than "how are you,"etc. Did not see Shaw at al
‘after 1965, presumably because Shaw had retired from Trade Mart

6/3/76 Internal from J. Walton Moore

 

Indicates concern for response re: Shaw's connection with
CIA. Can reconstruct contact by Leake, but "since we
cannot determine the nature of DCD's relationship with
Shaw from our files, we ouwld wppreciate your summarizing
it for us."

File contains reports made by Clay Shaw pursuant to contacts by
CIA between 1949-1956; memoranda which followed the course of the
Shaw trial and investigation because of alleged CIA involvement.
CIA tried to determine relationship between Shaw and Permindex or
World Trade Center. There appears to be none.
