I. GENERAL SUMMARIES: REVIEW OF CLASSIFIED AGENCY AND WARREN
‘COMMISSION MATERIALS

 

(A) FBI
The FBI has an extensive and efficient data retrieval system.

Each filed document is indexed and serialized. An abstract of
every document is prepared and filed separately by author and
subject. The system ensures that it is virtually impossible to
destroy the record of a document's existence once that document
has been filed. However, the Committee is not itself allowed to use
this data retrieval system; we have been required to make requests
to the FBI and rely upon a good faith compliance. Thus, gaining
access to FBI materials has always been for the Committee a tedious
and time consuming project. It became even more difficult after the
Committee announced an expiration date of February 29, 1976.

Unlike the CIA, the Bureau refused to make their Oswald and
assassination investigation files available en toto for our review.

This necessitated a series of lengthy Committee document requests.

‘

 

One copy of each of these requests has been included in the
separate book forwarded herewith for your review.

In addition to the standard FBI multilayered screening and
approval process for Committee document requests (which informs
the Bureau as to the areas into which we are inquiring), the
latest "procedural technique" adopted by the Bureau is worth
mentioning: viz., the Bureau's refusal to even begin gathering
documents pursuant.to our requests until they receive a copy of
our request from the Justice Department. This would not be
especially noteworthy, except for the Bureau's earlier suggestion
that we copy them on all of our requests to expedite the process,
and their subsequent failure to inform the Committee's Justice
liaison -- who under the established procedure correctly saw no
reason to forward our requests to the Bureau with all deliberate
speed -- of the changed procedure.

Eventually, documents have come forth from the Bureau for our
review. We have been able to somewhat expedite our review by
initially examining abstracts of correspondence and memoranda rather
than the documents themselves, and, subsequently, selecting certain
materials to be reviewed in their entirety. However, even the use
of abstracts has not allowed us to even familiarize ourselves with
FBI materials in other than the few areas to which we decided to

direct our attention. Our inability to review even the relevant

intelligence Agency attitudes -- such as the demonstrated re-
luctance to disclose information obtained from sensitive operations,
informants, sources, or techniques (whether legal or illegal) --
suggested certain areas where deficiencies were more likely to

have occurred. It is to these areas, and to the areas identified
by allegations publicly advanced over the past twelve years, that

the staff has directed its efforts.

bling a thorough review of the Commission's findings and con-
clusions; a process that would require us to construct and sub-
stitute findings and conclusions where we found the Commission's
deficient.* Indeed, we estimate that just to review and cate-
gorize the relevant Agency materials would take us from six
months to a year.

The Warren Commission relied almost entirely upon the intell-
igence community, and, in particular, the FBI, as the provider
of facts upon which the Commission based its finding and con-
clusions. The Select Committee's "intelligence expertise” com-
bined with its established access to Agency personnel and materials
suggested a preliminary inquiry designed to determine (1) whether
evidence was not provided to the Commission, and; (2) whether the
intelligence Agency's assassination investigation was deficient
-- an inquiry well within the letter and spirit of S. Res. 21.

In mid-November, we sought and received your approval to

conduct such an inquiry. However, it soon became apparent that

our limited resources precluded even a preliminary examination
of all possible substantive areas in which disclosure or investi-

gative deficiencies might have occurred. Our knowledge of certain

 

 

* It is, in any event, doubtful whether, under S. Res. 21, we
would have the authority to conduct a "full-scale" review of the
Warren Commission's findings and conclusions, even if we had the
resources to do it.

INTRODUCTION

Although a good deal of the evidentiary record compiled to
date is well known to you by virtue of your extensive participa-
tion in the interviews and executive session testimony, the staff
has admittedly been somewhat derelict in providing the detailed
information developed pursuant to our review of classified
Agency materials. In partial justification, we wanted to first
ourselves wade through the factual morass that has engulfed the
Warren Commission's report over the past twelve years.. The instant
report treats in summary fashion all aspects of the investigatory
course pursued by the subcommittee staff over the past three ©
months and sets forth the findings, albeit tentative, that can be
drawn from the evidence reviewed.

Since early June, Dan Dwyer and Ed Greissing devoted a con-
siderable amount of time to Warren Commission-related matters.

Paul Wallach began work in this area in late October; Jim Johnston

and Tom Dawson (part-time) began in late November. The subcommittee's
staff -- which has functioned as an autonomous unit within the
Committee -- has never been more than two counsel -- Jim and Paul --
and three members of the research staff.

By early November, it became apparent that we had to restructure
and restrict our inquiry to allow for limitations of (1) time; (2)
staff, and; (3) investigative expertise. The factual complexity

of the issues involved precluded our undertaking anything resem-

MEMORANDUM
TO : Senator Schweiker and Senator Hart (Colorado)
FROM : Select Committee Staff

DATE ° February 20, 1976

SUBJECT: Preliminary Report of Investigation into the Assassination
of President Kennedy

The purpose of this report is to provide you with a comprehensive
summary of the significant evidence developed in the course of this in-
vestigation, together with the staff's analysis of that evidence. Since
the staff desired to give you the opportunity to begin reviewing this
report, certain sections are not yet in this booklet. For example, re-
ports on various allegations of CIA connections with persons involved
in the Garrison investigation are not finished. Likewise, ‘the report
on the FBI's role in the investigation is incomplete, but should be
ready on Monday. ;

This booklet is a narrative of the evidence we have developed. It
is divided into sections, marked by Tabs, in accordance with the attach-
ed Table of Contents. There are only three copies of this booklet and
each has been registered with the Committee's document custodian be-
cause of the extremely sensitive material contained in it.

In addition to this report, the staff has prepared three booklets
of documents generated by its investigation. These are maintained in
only one copy. Two booklets -- one for FBI and one for CIA -- contain
the documents designated in this report as TAB . We did not feel it
was necessary for you to examine these documents since they are summarized
in the narrative portion of this report; however, the booklets of docu-
“ments are available at your request.

The fourth booklet contains a copy of all requests to the agencies,
together with their responses. It serves as a record of the course and
nature of the investigation. It, too, is available at your request.

Finally, you should be aware of the fact that the staff investiga-
tion is continuing. Several very significant: requests have not yet
been met by the agencies. However, rather than delay this report by
waiting for these documents, the staff will supplement this report if
new information is developed.
