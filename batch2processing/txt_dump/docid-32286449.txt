Representatives of this office have been in daily :
contact with Attorney JORGE VAZQUEZ ROBLES of Mexican Immigration,
and his office has taken. no further action in this matter to date.
The observations in Chicago teletype 7/27/6%, instructions in
Bureau cable 7/28/67, and the importance of the relationship
between this Office and Mexican Immigration make it inadvisable

to try to influence the latter agency to take any specific

action in this matter at the present time. It has been repeatedly
emphasized, however, that this Office desires be advised, of
any pertinent.“developments regarding subject. Ah,

When questioned concerning Nubes 2, DORENBERG only
acknowledged that she had handled the sale of this property.
She noted that the property formerly belonged to Mr. ANDRES
and currently belongs to the company Las Nubes, S.A., which
is administered-by Attorney JORGE CASTILLO. She would not
identify the resident of the address but stated that no one
was currently in residence at that address¢ ¢ ps

Based on this information, it would appear that
subject is not currently in Cuernavaca, and Chicago should be
alert to his possible presence in the United. States.
