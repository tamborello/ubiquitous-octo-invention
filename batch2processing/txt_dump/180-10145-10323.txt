“F1110852

Wash Post news article indicates Ricardo Morales
_ Venez. Intelligence offical, reported to FBI that he had been
told of a plot to kill Pascal (Luis Andres Pascal Allende-
relative of Allende). Otero said he went to DINA officials
and identified himself as a fugitive from the US. At DINA HQs
said he was told the secret police support the Cuban exiles
cause and would provide funds and arms for them in return
for a “favor." The favor was to kill Pascal and Anne Marie
 Brussier -sic- Beausire - in Costa Rica before 2/22/76.
Bosch to be back-up if Otero failed in the mission.
According to Otero, he refused to do the favor , left Chile and
told Morales. Returned to Santiago and arrested two week s
earlier.

Bosch arrested 2/19/ entering Costa Rica and charged with

- false passport and plotting to kill Secy of State Henry Kissinger, ~

Pascal and Brussier. No trial, Bosch deported. Returned to
Santiago and apparently remained there until going to Carribean
to organize CORU.

This info suppressed at 76 sept trila of Otero- Otero found
innocent.

Otero had lived in FL until late December 1975 when he was told

by FBI informant that FBI was preparing to have him indicted on
bombing charges. Otero then went to Dom Rep where he was
arrested and paroled. When Miami Fed Grand Jury reurned indictmen
against Otero, he flew to caracas where stayed with Morales. Info
in reports alleges that Otero was told that if Venez. authorities
moved to arrest him, he could receive asylum with new Chilean .
ambassador. While in Cracas, Otero allegedly told Morales that

he had committed the bombings in Miami ans Morales passed this
information to the FBI.

Much of info on plot to kill Pascal and Brussier could have
come from Morales -- in FBi report. Morales was source

of numerous secret Service reports during Kissinger visit to
Caracas 2/76 on reprted attempt to kill Kissinger.
