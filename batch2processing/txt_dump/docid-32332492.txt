The title of this case has been marked "changed" to include

the MRP, an anti-CASTRO organization which has been operat-—

ing jointly with the SNFE, utilizing the same office space,

+ and one of whose members, NOEL SALAS, was captured in Cuba
with ELOY GUTIERREZ MENOYO, The name Alianza Revolucionaria
is also being added to the title, since the combination of
the SNFE, ALPHA 66, and MRP frequently refer to themselves sf
by this ‘name. Several members of the Federacion Estudiantil 3
Universitaria (FEU) are active with the SNFE, but the FEU, v
a8 a group, is not, and is of such minor significance that_
it is not being included in the new title. ~

interview RAFAEL FRAGA and SERGIO DIAZ, who were report-
edly sent from New York to Florida to join the military
DIAZ and FRAGA are two of the

Cubans who participated in the SNFE walk from New York

In view of the capture of GUTIERREZ MENOYO
in Cuba on January 23, 1965, it is not believed that in-
terview with DIAZ and FRAGA would be of value at the
present time, and these interviews will not be conducted,
