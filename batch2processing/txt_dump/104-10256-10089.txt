in Mitchell Livingston WerBell Ii

In answer to our inquiry to the Office of Security regarding the formulation

of an answer to the State Department inquiry on WerBell, Mr. Vic White

authorized a statement along the following Itnes on 9 January 1968:

“The Central Intelligence Agency has no professional interest in
nor business contact with subject. He is, however, an indtvidual known
to us who, over a considerable period of time, has attempted to volunteer
information to various officers at different locations of this Agency. It
is our interpretation that his actions were primarily designed to gain
access to us in order to benefit his own business undertakings. Some of
his actions would lead us to believe be has somewhat of an erratic

personality.”
