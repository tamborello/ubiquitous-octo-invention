8. The Branch has developed component parts for other development
and engineering branch projects.

9. The Branch is involved in a radiation health badge service for .
personnel overseas,

The Chemical Branch has not been engaged in any experimentation with
drugs which influence the mind or behavior. They have not been involved
at all with drugs that would in any way affect humans. If any branch
would carry on such activity, it would be the Chemical Branch.

t The Manufacture of Poison Capsules

 

If poison capsules had been manufactured by CIA, the most likely place
for such manufacture would have been the Biological Branch of CTS or
TSD. Boston states that the Branch did have some capsules when he
first came aboard (he doesn't know who developed them; they have since
been destroyed). These were hydrogen-cyanide capsules for suicides.
They could not be given to a human unknowingly as the person taking
the capsule had to crush a gas capsule with his teeth and then suck back
sharply.

Boston is not aware of any other poison capsules which have been manu-
factured by the Chemical Branch. or by the Biological Branch between

- 1961 and 1968. Boston reiterated that if a tasteless poison were to be
developed in capsule form, witha delayed lethal reaction, it would
almost surely be developed by the Biological Branch of TSD,

Boston stated that the Biological Branch was working with Fort Dietrich
on a dart launcher which would shoot a tiny dart which could not be felt
by the victim. The dart was large enough to carry lethal material but
it was being developed to simply immobilize victims and it apparently
was not large enough to carry sufficient amounts of knock-out material.

Boston believes he would have heard of a poison capsule project but he
is not sure. The requirement may have come to a specific individual
if it was a sensitive job. .

Miscellaneous Matters

Those Persons who may have been involved in early drug Programs
include Dr, Treichler, Dr, Bortner (dead) and Dr. Gotlieb (in India)...
Other old-timers in the Chemistry Branch include Dr, Lashbrook
(retired in 1960).

1. The development of power Sources. This is by far the Chemical
Branch's most important activity, taking UP about two-thirds of its time,
These PoWer sources are the types which are used by @gents in trang-
mitters, etc., used in the field. These batteries must be of long-life

2. The analytical facility Previously Operated by the Biological
Branch is NOW operated by the Chemical Branch.
