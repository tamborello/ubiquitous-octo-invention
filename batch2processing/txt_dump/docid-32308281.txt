During contact set out in enclosed LHM, DIAZ
LANZ furnished an eight-page leaflet captioned "Major
Diaz And the Press". This leaflet, a reprint of an "American
Opinion” article, sets. out alleged’ press distortions. of h
testimony given by DIAZ LANZ before the Senate Internal .
Security subcommittee in July, 1959, following his
defection from Cuba. He also furnished a paperback copy
of "Its Very Simple", subcaptioned "The True Story of
Civil Rights". This 1965 book by ALAN STANG seeks to
substantiate the author's charge that "the Civil Rights
Movement is for the most part a Communist operation under
the cloak of which the Communists hope to capture this
country"; DIAZ LANZ also furnished a one page Spanish .
language handout warning Cuban exiles not to participate
ina "Replica"-sponsored street protest on behalf of
ORLANDO BOSCH and other arrested Cuban Power members. The
handout asserted that this public activity, like Negro
street demonstrations in various cities, was initiated
by Communists in the hope of provoking violence between
marchers and civil authorities. The handout was signed
"PEDRO LUIS DIAZ LANZ". DIAZ LANZ indicated that he has
ideas for more such handouts and owns a duplicating machine,
but lacks paper and does not presently have the funds to
purchase same.

 

The above-mentioned paperback is a newsstand
item and has no significance in this matter. It is therefore
not being maintained. The eight-page leaflet and one
page handout are being maintained in the 1-A section of
the MM 105-1598 file.

DIAZ LANZ during contact set out in endosed ;
LHM, gave no indication that he is deranged or emotionally |
unstable; however, as DIAZ LANZ has renewed his right '
wing lectures‘and has shown himself eager to participate |
