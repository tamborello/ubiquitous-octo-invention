Item #4 was obtaine@d from Lt. JOSEPH J, SMITH, -

Guard, 501 N.E, First Ave., Room 301, Miami, Fla. ‘

On 8/27/68, Captain BRODIE advised that through
arrangements with the Port of Miami Harbor Patrol Boat, the
area in the vicinity of Pier Til, Old Port, Miami, where the
"Caribbean Venture" had docked, was dragged with a magnet
for possible fragments or other evidence of the explosion
that occurred aboard that vessel. In. connection with this
search three pieces of chain have been recovered which appeared
to be mauled and twisted and broken. Also found was a piece
of twisted metal, similar in appearance to other metal: frag-
ments found inside the "Caribbean Venture" and previously
forwarded to the FBI Laboratory. This piece of metal has a
curvature in it similar to. the contour of chain fragments.
These items are being prepared for forwarding to the FBI
Laboratory. Cos .

‘In this connection it is noted. that on 8/28/68,
an entire bomb was found attached to the British vessel
"Lancastrian Princess" and all items contained therein were
forwarded to the FBI Laboratory in a separate case on that —
matter (Miami File 45-1172). It is noted that the device on
the "Lancastrian Princess".was attached by a link of chain
which was woven through some grill work on the bottom of that
ship. rv ‘
