; Mr. PELOQUIN | stated he: desired,:if. possible,
that the’ record: of BRAY's travel ‘to and from Chicago at.
“the” time he made the trip and changed the ‘Central Casualty
stock so that it appeared in EGAN'S name rather than his:
name be determined. He also requested that, if possible,
the public stenographer BRAY and. EGAN contacted about June
| of 1961, to have the bond typed up, be contacted. It was
pointed’ out to Mr. PELOQUIN that the record of, Central |
Casualty Company public stenographic bill in the amount of
$6.00 for stenographic services rendered on May 11,'1961,
from an address of 69 N..W. 26th Avenue, was found. Mr.
PELOQUIN advised it is quite possible that this is the
contact with the public stenographer that EGAN said might
have occurred in June of 1961.

[

 

 

 

“Mr. PELOQUIN stated that/if the travel date. :

BRAY made this trip to Chicago and back could be determined, :
it is his plan to prepare an indictment against BRAY and ‘
possibly present it to the next sessi Jury ;
‘ pach ff expected: to meet on or about} in .

y

Mr. PELOQUIN stated that an Interstate Transporta-
tion in Aid of Racketeering violation against ALDERISIO
and TRAFFICANTE would require considerably more work and,
therefore, he did not expect to be able to have an indictment I
returned against either or both of these individuals in the  .-
next session of this Grand Jury. . Mr. PELOQUIN pointed out
that it would be necessary to prove the interstate travel
on the part of ALDERISIO and/or TRAFFICANTE in connection
with the ‘threats ALDERISIO made to EGAN. . Mr. PELOQUIN
stated since the exact dates of these threats have not
yet been ascertained it is his hope, through recontact
with EGAN and BRAY, contact with the Fontainebleau Hotel
and possibly a check of ALDERISIO's travels about. June of
- 1962, to be able to show ALDERISIO making interstate travel
: prior to the time he threatened ‘EGAN.

in the know in Cuba have confirmed, that for his: services —
to PHIL ALDERISIO--SANTC TRAFFICANTE, etc. he was given

a substantial interest in the. Deauville Gambling Casino and

about this he was crying about his loss of a vast fortune
occasioned by CASTRO. )

CHICAGO

At Chicago, Illinois:

Will maintain contact with a
CG6656-PC-TE as well as any other informants or sources
who know of ALDERISIO's activity for indications of
reaction on his part since he apparently suspects ‘the
investigation is under way and also for any indications
of his method of interstate travel to or from Miami about
May or June, 1962.

DENVER
At Denver, Colorado: -

Will re-interview EGAN, who Departmental Attormey
HARRINGTON states appears to be considerably more relaxed
now that he feels confident he will not be indicted on
this matter. However, because of EGAN's severe heart con-
dition, he should not be interviewed extensively, and all -
reasonable consideration should be given him since it appears
he is now cooperative, and, therefore, anything that might
excite him or tax his health should be avoided. EGAN should
be interviewed for all data he might: possess to establish
the date of the meeting in: KAY's office at Miami Beach, >
which meeting BRAY indicated was probably in late May, 1962,°-
or sometime in early June, 1962. In the event EGAN was a
guest at the Nautilus Hotel on any dates later than those
listed in this report, the approximate dates should be
ascertained. If EGAN is able to recall the hotel where he
was staying when he met ALDERISIO in KAY's office, it might .
be possible .to establish the date of this meeting. Also,
EGAN mentioned he would search his records| at home since
he might have check stubs or travel coupons’ “to! show the date
of his travel to Miami Beach about late May or early.June,
1962. Since BRAY has apparently been in contact with EGAN
since EGAN returned from the Miami Grand Jury, EGAN should
be interviewed to determine what data he learned from BRAY.

ADMINISTRATIVE

 

When Departmental Attorney HARRINGTON tele- a
Phonically advised SA LENIHAN on 7/26/63 of the fact t
that he and PELOQUIN had interviewed BRAY, SA LENIHAN
was engaged full time in a lengthy trial on case cap-
tioned "MICHAEL ROSA, aka. et al, ITSP; CONSPIRACY, "

Bureau file No. 87-69249,. Therefore, there was no
opportunity to immediately interview HARRINGTON to
determine the results of his interview with BRAY.

| INFORMANTS:

On 7/8/63, former MM 722-C. advised SA PRUE C,
CLINKSCALES he had just learned of a severe fire at the - >
Fireside Restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in which z
that restaurant was completely burned. Source advised that
he had been in Chicago during the period from mid June to
July 2, 1903, and while there was in almost daily contact
with Bureau Agents of the Chicago Office, He said that he
learned of an intensified investigation being made by the : i.
Chicago FBI Office believed to be at the specific request . i
of the Department of Justice, concerning the fires at :*
several large restaurants in the Chicago area in which
arson was suspected. Such restaurants in Chicago are ; |

reportedly owned by numerous "syndicate" or "outfit"
boys who are suspected of burning such restaurants
because of business failure. .

Source advised that as best he can learn
"Milwaukee Phil," whose correct name he could not furnish
immediately but who is well-known to various FBI Offices,
reportedly had a financial interest in one or more of the
restaurants in Chicago which had burned and wcording to
information he had received, "Milwaukee Phil" also had

. & financial interest in the Fireside Restaurant, at

Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which burned either the night

of 7/6 or 7/7/63. Source continued that it is entirely
possible that "Milwaukee Phil" is not the owner or partner
‘of record" but 1s merely a silent or hidden partner in
the Fireside Restaurant which burned.

Por eo ane CG6656-PC-TE both advised
that they are famillar w ALDERISIO's current activities.
Both of these individuals stated that it is impossible

to determine as to whether ALDERISIO was in Miami, Florida,
in March or April, 1962, because ‘in dealing with ALDERISIO
no one asks him any questions or delves into his business.
