On September 17, 1963, SJ T-1, a Cuban exile (we)
residing in Puerto Rico, who is in a position to know |
certain aspects of Cuban and Haitian activity in Puerto
Rico, advised he had learned that the JURE had held a
@lebration on September 15, 1963, at Juana Diaz, Puerto
Rico, commemorating the first anniversary of the JURE.

At this celebration the JURE announced the signing of a pact
for mutual help with the Fuerzas Unificadas de Liberacion
Haitiana (Unified Forces for the Liberation of Haiti) (FUL).
The purpose of the signing of this pact was for one or

‘the other group to lend its assistance when Cuba or Haiti

is liberated from their respective governments. -

The September 17, 1963, issue of "El Mundo", a
daily San Juan, Puerto Rico, Spanish language newspaper,
carried an article entitled "Cuban Group signs Pact with
Haitians". This article indicated in part that the
first anniversary of JURE had been celebrated on
September 15, 1963 at Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico. At this
celebration, EMILIO GUEDE, chief of propaganda for JURE,
announced the signing of a pact’of mutual help between
the FUL and JURE in order that when one or the other, Cuba
or Haiti, is free from dictatorship, the other would help in
the fight for liberation. Mr. GUEDE told "El Mundo" that
the pact had been signed about one month ago by MANUEL
RAY and Dr. ROLANDO AGRAMONTE, secretary of exterior
relations, both of JURE, and PAUL VERNA and GEORGES LACOMBE
of the FUL. It was indicated that VERNA was from Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic, and LACOMBE from San Juan,
Puerto Rico and that both are Haitians.
