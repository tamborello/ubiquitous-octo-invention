Peiping Approaches Cambodian
risis Carefully

The Chinese Communists are
showing considerable caution

in their reactions to Prince
Sihanouk's apparently unsolicited
outbursts concerning his inten-
sions to turn to them for aid,
although they are attempting to

appear responsive to his position.

In a 21 November government state-
ment, the Chinese carefully
avoided any real commitment to
Cambodia and were studiously
vague about the extent to which
they intend to support Sihanouk.

The Chinese hesitated for
over two weeks before issuing
their statement and they is-
sued it then because of the
pressure of a situation over
which they have no control.
The statement avoids the ques—
tion of economic or technical
aid. It does offer "all-out
support" for Cambodia in the
event of an invasion by the US,

South Vietnam, or Thailand. Even
this high-sounding promise,
however, is carefully hedged
with a preliminary reference to
the 1954 Geneva agreements, sug-
gesting that "all-out support”

ganda calls for joint action
under the International Control
Commission and would not include
unilateral Chinese Communist
military aid.

. While Peiping probably
could supplant US aid to Cam-
bodia, its enthusiasm is appar-
ently considerably dampened by
Sihanouk's unpredictability.
The Chinese are well aware that
previous expressions of similar
desires by Sihanouk were used
as pressure tactics to enhance
Cambodia's position. Although
in the present crisis Sihanouk
appears more serious than in
earlier ones, the Chinese are
unwilling to leap in before they
are certain of the outcome.

Rumania’s Industrial Development

Rumanian party first secre-
tary Gheorghiu-Dej has just com—
pleted another tour of industrial
construction sites throughout
Rumania--his sixth such trip in
the last two months. The exten-
sive Rumanian press coverage of
the trip is designed to show
both Rumania's rapid economic
growth and its broadening trade
contacts with the West. —

The Rumanian public has
been officially informed for
the first time of the extent
of West European participation
in the construction of indus-
trial installations in Rumania.
It is also the first time that
detailed information has been
given to the public regarding
industrial installations. Press
coverage divulges statistics on
production capacities. of the
various installations as well
as on the items they produce.
Information on the planning
and construction of the facto--.
ries also is unusually detailed.

On 13 November the party
visited Slatina, the site of
an aluminum plant whose con-
struction is just beginning.
According to the Rumanian press,
the plant ultimately will have
an annual production capacity
of 50,000 tons of aluminum and
alloys and will be completed in
the next 18 months with help of
a French firm. Other sources

indicate, however, that the
French firm is assisting in, con-
struction of the first stage of
the plant, which will have a
30,000-ton capacity. | Equipment
is being provided by several
West European countries, the
press reported.

The Craiova chemical com-
bine will include 14 factories
having a capacity of about 300,-
000 tons of ammonium nitrate
fertilizer and 100,000 tons of
urea, according to the press
which also reported that the
ammonia, nitric acid, and ammo-
nium nitrate factories-~-planned
and equipped by the USSR-~- are
over two thirds completed.
Belgium, Holland, and West Ger-
many are supplying equipment
for portions of the combine.

From various sources it is
known that during 1960-61 West-
ern firms added several ‘catalyti
refining installations to the
Brazi oil refinery, built in
1934. The Rumanian press now
reports that the Rumanians re-
cently completed construction
of a crude :oil distillation
unit with a three-million-ton
capacity. This unit will boost
the plant's capacity from 1.5
million tons to 4.5 million tons
per year. Brazi is one of the
three major refineries in which
Rumania plans to concentrate
its refining capacity. The press

French Aid to Cambodia \

circles over Sihanouk's recent
actions, the prince's direct
appeal for French aid has posed
a dilemma for Paris. A flat
rejection could adversely affect
France's position in Africa and
the Middle East, as well as in
Southeast Asia. On the other
hand, Paris is probably reluc-
tant to take over the recently
canceled US financial commitments
in Cambodia. i :

of offering Phnom Penh $5 million
in economic and cultural aid,
plus either larger loans or
greater export credits.

Perhaps related to their
plans’ to assist Cambodia is the
strong possibility that French
Defense Minister Messmer will
be sent to Cambodia in January.

Since 1956, French grant
aid has amounted to $15 million.
Negotiations for an additional
$2 million have been deadlocked
for the past 18 months by dis-
agreements over exchange rates.

noting that the UK also faces

World Reaction to Change of US
ministration

World reaction to the as-
sassination of President Ken~
nedy and its aftermath is in-
creasingly preoccupied with
speculation over the possible
effects on US foreign and do-
mestic policies.

Oswald's Communist back-
ground, however, and his dra-
matic murder while in police
custody are being exploited for
almost every conceivable propa-
ganda line. The USSR continues
to reflect sensitivity over Os-
wald's political motivations;
Khrushchev, talking with Am-
bassador Kohler on 23 November,
recalled that Lenin had con-
demned "nihilist" activities
and asserted the Soviet Communist
Party is traditionally opposed
to terrorism.

Pravda, citing a denial by
the US Communist. Party that Os-
waid had ever been a member,
suggested he was linked to
"American Trotskyites," but con-
cluded that the Kennedy assas-
Sination was the work of "fasc~
ist forces" trying to destroy
the detente atmosphere.

Papers in West Germany,
Belgium, and Lebanon, among
others, theorize Oswald was
killed by associates to silence
him. A Cairo newspaper calls
his killer "one Jack Rubenstein,
a Jew of course." The US Em-
bassy in Beirut has received
many telegrams speculating that

SECRET

GENERAL

Oswald's killing is evidence of
a Communist plot against the US.
The émbassy notes with dismay
the probable foreign impact of
dramatic news photos showing the
escorting officer apparently
looking away while Oswald is
shot.

An Afrikaans paper in
Johannesburg editorialized that
while US racial difficulties
might not be "directly concerned
with the assassination," they
had become a vehicle for the
undermining of the state by the
Communists and Afro-Asians.

: A Cairo editorial expresses
concern that President Johnson,
while committed to the policies
of his predecessor, may have to
compromise and. postpone decisions
in order to avoid antagonisms
as the US enters an election
year. Syrian Vice President
Bitar commented to Ambassador
Knight on 25 November that the
Arab cause might suffer from
the loss of President Kennedy,
“who had shown signs of increas-
ingly better understanding of
the Arabs and their problems."

West German and French
press commentaries range from
expectations of initial uncer-
tainty or temporizing in US for-
eign policy to the gloomy view
of Der Spiegel that it is "doomed
to immobility™ for the next
year. Some segments of the
British press had suggested
