AR

: NO 1435-C-TE advised on 7/5/67 that he had a
lengthy discussion with CARLOS MARCELLO relative to the
construction of an Italian - American Club. MARCELLO advised
informant that numerous out-of-State visitors that he has had
in the past have often mentioned to him there should be an
exclusive Italian club in the New Orleans area where they
could hold meetings. MARCELLO indicated that many of his
close associates in the New Orleans area think this is an
excellent idea.

 

Accordingly, CARLOS MARCELLO proposed that the
informant build and manage such a club. MARCELLO offered to
finance this deal, however, informant is very reluctant to
accept the money from MARCELLO as he never would get any of
the profits.

Informant believes he can obtain the money from
! the Small Business Administration as he understands from |
his attorney that the Small Business Administration is
“pushing money".

Informant pointed out he has a very poor credit

Fl rating and that this fact will probably OC his a)
