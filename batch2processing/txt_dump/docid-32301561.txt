Later on December 24, 1963, MM T-1 said that
Bosch announced to his party that it had become neces-
sary again to postpone the bombing raid from December
25, 1963, to a later date due to rough seas which would
endanger the boat. One of Bosch's associates indicated
that the boat would probably leave Miami on_ Friday,
December 27, 1963. (It is to be. noted that a cold front
Swept over the Miami area on the early morning of
December 24, 1963, and seas were reportedly rough. )

cember 26, 1963, MM T-1 advised that the
pilot ould take both an afternoon and night
practice t with the Piper Aztee plane in possession

of Charles Bush at Broward International Airport. Bosch
provided money to the pilot for the flight.

MM T-1 said that Bosch disclosed that the boat
is now scheduled to depart Miami hetween 5:30 p.m. and
6:00 p.m. on December 27, 1963, for Bimini. T-1 said
there will be no additional practice flights by the pilot
after December 26, 1963. 5

It is to be noted that on December 26, 1963,
the skies in the Miami area were clear and sunny, and
weather conditions were reportedly favorable at sea.

On December 20, 1963, MM T-1 advised that
Doctor Bosch planned to have the raiding party drop
propaganda leaflets over Cuba. MM T-1 furnished the
propaganda leaflet, which is in the Spanish language and
which has been translated as follows:

a Cuban exile who,has been involved in anti-Fidel Castro

activit send veral years, reflects that Doctor
Orland ivila, head of the Movimiento Insurrecional
ec era a Revolucionaria (MIRR), an anti-Fidel

Castro organization of Cuban exiles, has been planning
a bombing raid against an oil refinery at Nuevitas,
Camaguey Province of Cuba. This raid was originally
scheduled for the night of December 14, or 15, 1963.
It was then postponed, and as of December 18, 1963,

Bosch indicated the last and final practive flight in an
Aero Commander airplane, registration N26-24-B, preparatory
to the raid would take place on the night of December 20,

1963, at Broward International Airport in Florida,

0, 1963, MM T-1 advised that

he Cuban pilot scheduled to
pilo¥ the plane in this bombing raid, went to Broward
International Airport where Charles Bush, owner of the
Aero Commander, informed the pilot that one of the
motors of the plane had "burned out," and the plane
could not be flown without en pone! repairs.
MM T-1 said that the pilot,

examined the plane

and verified that one of the motors was in fact not oper-~
able. Bush promised he would make another plane avail-

able to Doctor Orlando Bosch.

On the safe day, MM T-1 learned that someone
other than Charles”Bush would pilot whatever plane was
selected from Broward International Airport to Bimini,
Bahama Islands, preparatory to the bombing raid. The

individual selected to pilot this plane would park the
plane on the Bimini airport and register at a hotel in
the town of Bimini, leaving the plane unattended over-

at Bimini under cover of darkness from Miami and load the

._ * On December 22, 1963, MM T-1 advised that Charles
Bush informed Alpizar that he would substitute a Piper
Aztec plane for the Aero Commander. MM T-1 said that Bush
had such a plane at his company at Broward International

rport.

. ._ On December 23, 1963, Mr. Fay Linehan, Super-
vising Inspector, Federal Aviation Agency, Miami, advised
that Charles Bush has leased a Piper Aztec plane bearing
registration N4811-P from the Fleet Rental Leasing Corpor-.
ation, Box 948, Clarkesburg, West Virginia, effective in
April, 1963. Mr. Linehan advises this 1s the Aztec plane
which Bush maintains at his place of business.

On December 23, 1963, MM T-1 advised that
Doctor Bosch advised that the boat which he planned to use
in transporting the airplane crew and the bombs from Miami
to Bimini would depart from Miami on Christmas Day at about
10:00 a.m. or 12:00 a.m. He said this boat has a speed of
only 10 miles per: hour, and consequently would have to
depart early in the day instead of during the evening as
was originally -planned had a faster boat been obtained,
Bosch said the plane would leave later in the day after
receiving a radio signal from the boat that everything was

proceeding according to plan. , a are
MM T-1 said that wssrsgi(foroson, who made

arrangements for the securing of this boat on behalf of
Bosch, disclosed that the Coral Gables canal would be a
better place to depart :from than the place which Bosch had
in mind. :
