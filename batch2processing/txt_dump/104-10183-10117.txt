had aot been in Rome one to two weeks carlier. AMWHIP/1 said that
he had not. BUNCE said that he was surprised because he had
information that AMWHIP/I had stayed for two days and nights in a
hotel on the Piazza Barberini. Leoking quite flustered, AMWHIP,/1
‘said that he could not understand tox this fact had slipped his
mind, Of course he had been here! BUNCE pointed out that the
coverage here in Rome is obviously efficient and that he should
bear this fact in mind. A®WHIP/1 repeated that he could not
understand how he had forgotten his prior visit. The remainder

_ ofthe brief conversation was cordial,

. -° 6. En route to BUNCE's quarters BUNCE asked AMWHIP/2 whether
AMWHIP/1 had told him about a visit made ten days to two weeks
earlier, AMWHIP/2 said that AMWEIP.] had not divulged this trip
until the preceding evening, 10 Mewember 1964. He said that he 4
then learned that_AMWHIP/1 had bee= accompanied By his mistress, f
Tdentity A, AMWHIP/2 lamented the relationship, He said that —
some time ago he had called AMWHIP“L's New York apartment on
‘ business and had been told by his wife to try to reach AMWHIP/1

“ at the store in the’ morning. In this way, he explained, he first
learned that even in New York AMWRIP/1 sleeps with Identity A rathe
than at home, He said that Identity A has AMWHIP/1 completely
under her thumb. BUNCE-asked whether he considered it possible
or even. probable that ANSHIP/1 discusses his work for us (i.e.,
KUBARK) with Identity A, AMWHIP,"2 said that he was positive he
tells her everything. He said, “I am not just 99% sure of this.
I am 100% sure." He added that ANYHIP/1 also confides in
Identity A all details about their various business transactions.

     
 

7. BUNCE asked whetner AM#HIP’2 has any reason to suspect
that Identity A works for the PBRUWEN 1S or has any other connections,
direct or indirect, through which information which she obtains
_ fron AMWHIP/1 might be relayed to the PBRUMEN IS or government.
AMWHIP/2 answered that he does not think so, He said that Ideatity A
is not a Communist and is anti-AMTHUG, He also described her as

stupid.

8. Although AMWHIP/2 did not place restrictions upon our use
of this information, BUNCE does not know how widely known is either
the AMWHIP.’l-Identity A relationship or the extent of AMWHIP/1's
disclosures to Identity A, It may be that if AMWHIP/1 were
confronted directly with this matter and charged with insecurity,
he would spot AMWHIP/2 as the source of our information, This
possibility is strengthened by the fact that immediately after
BUNCE brought up AMWHIP/1's visit to Rome, AMM#HIP/2 and BUNCE left
to spend the evening together, as AM*HIP/1 knows, What action,
if any, should be taken in respect to AMWHIP,’1 is plainly a matter
for Headquarters decision, It is requested, however, that action
which would tend to pinpoint AMAHIP ‘2.as the source of our infor +
mation be avoided, It is also requested that we be advised of the

action taken, 41 any.

9. Further information supplied by AMWHIP/2 is being reported
separately,

4. During a meeting of 11 December 1964 wi th (DEVIGIL/27)
BUNCE mentioned the presence of ANWHIP/1 in Italy DW such a way
as to suggest that we had known about it all along but that it was
merely a pleasure trip. In point of fact, however, AMWHIP/1 did
not get in touch with SMITHAM or BUNCE during his 28 to 39 November

stay in Rome.

5. On 10 December 1964 AMWHIP/2 telephoned BUNCE's home from
his store here, and arrangements were made for BUNCE to pick him
up there the following evening because AMNHIP/2 wanted to take BUNCE
and wife to dinner, When BUNCE arrived on 11 December, AMWHIP/1
was also at the store. BUNCE talked with ANMWHIP/! for ten minutes,

his earlier visit to Rome, BUNCE then asked him HG th prs if he
