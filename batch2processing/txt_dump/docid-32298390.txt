that the majority of Cuban exiles in Miami believed that this
attack was made by forces directed by Fidel. Castro in order
to embarrass the United States and perhaps to make the oper-
ation of Cuban exiles against Cuba more difficult in the
future (X/ a ;

MM T-3 also reported that the Cuban Government gun-
boat "24 de Febrero" had been in the immediate area of this
attack and that very shortly thereafter Cuban radio stations
were claiming that United States planes had interfered with
the intended rescue operations of the Cuban gunboat, MM T-3

SEPTEMBER. 13,1964  ‘wegssoe-BX!

NEUTRALITY MATTERS REASOL
BACKGROUND : DAT

Reference is made to previous memoranda entitled
"Secret Organization of Continental Action (OSAC)" relating
to reports that the Spanish merchant vessel "Sierra Aranzazu"
was attacked off Great Inagua, Bahamas, on September 13,1964,

It is noted, as previously reported, that the Sep-

_tember 16, 1964 issue of the "Miami News" a daily newspaper
published at Miami, contained an article stating that one

' Telmo Alvarez had called a news agency (United Press Inter- . é

national) and claimed his group, the Secret Organization of -

Continental Action (OSAC), was responsible for this attack.

In contradiction to this claim, it is noted that

Juan Mesa Rodriguez, a member of OSAC, when interviewed on
September 21, 1964, said he had not been consulted prior to
the press notification claiming OSAC responsibility and that
OSAC had not been connected in any way with the attack upon
the “Sierra oe .
It is also noted that on September 18, 1964, MM T-1,

a Cuban exile with contacts. in the Movimiento de Recuperacion
_Revolucionaria (MRR), an anti~Castro organization based in the

Caribbean, furnished information which he had received from
associates. in the MRR to the effect that two launches and a Pa
large boat operated by MRR personnel participated in the attack.
on the Spanish merchant vessel, in the mistaken belief they
were attacking a Cuban vessel. Wa)

Re: Attack on Spanish Vessel "Sierra Aranzazu", September 13, 1964

‘said Los Juramentados was definitely not involved in the attack.
They suggested the possibility that Castro had ordered the
attack to embarrass the United States, but said they had no
information to support this theory. mz :

I¥, MISCELLANEOUS

Antonio Perez Quesada, 365 Northwest North River
Drive, Miami, a Cuban exile who is currently occupied as a
fisherman in the Bahamas, and who in the past participated
in Some attacks on the north coast of Cuba, advised on Sep-
tember 22, 1964, that he had no knowledge concerning the
identity of the people who attacked the Spanish vessel. -He
expressed the opinion that the boats involved would have had
to be either very large boats or to have been based at a lo-
cation near the eastern end of Cuba, since the attack occurred
too far from the,United States to haye been launched from

this ee Mm) -

On ptember 22, 1964, MM T-2, a Cuban refugee with ,.
some knowledge of pro- and anti-Castro activities in the Miami -
area, reported that on the evening of September 19, 1964, he *
had overheard a conversation going on among a small group .of
exiled Cuban newspaper men regarding the sinking of the
Spanish vessel on September 13, 1964. MM T-2 said the news-
paper men agreed that the ship had been attacked by a launch
of the Cuban Navy and, according to this source, agreed on
this theory because it was unacceptable to them that the at-= ot
tack could have been made by an anti-Castro group due to the ~-
‘long-standing friendship between Cuba and Spain, as well as
the fact that Spa has been giving considerable assistance
to Cuban exiles / ma) . :
