GLEASON contacted LEVINE and LEVINE told him
-he could probably get the loan for the corporation to repay
the Savings and Loan Association. LEVINE did not produce for
six weeks and a meeting came about in. the informant's office.
At this meeting, LEVINE indicated he wanted money. CRISONA —
agreed to put up $10,000 in escrow. ‘The informant stated that
he would not accept escrow money. He felt that CRISONA, from
the tone of his conversation, would realize there was a
possibility LEVINE. was attempting to con him. CRISONA
readily agreed to furnish $10,000.f He wrote a check for
$10,000 to the informant, who, infturn, wrote a check to
LEVINE for $6,000. He stated he/is holding $4,000 for
incidental expenses concerning Ahis loan. Informant advised
that LEVINE is sending §' K,, a NewYork attorney to
Montreal, Canada, to attempt fo get this loan from the
National Canadian Bank.

 

 

Recommendation

It is recommended that the above information be used
by the Bureau to institute an investigation in the Washington,
D.C. area. It is possible that the Savings and Loan Association,
through OGILVEY acted in violation of the banking laws in
granting loans.

It is suggested that an attempt be made to identify
OGILVEY and the Federal Savings and Loan Association with which
he was connected. It is further suggested that appropriate |
bank officials be contacted at this institution and advised :
that information had been received from an anonymous source 1
indicating inproper activities on the part of OGILVEY. !

It is believed that investigation in this matter, if
instituted in the Washington, D.C. area, will not compromise
the informant. However, it is suggested that no disclosure
be made of this particular loan to Rock Hill to officials
of this bank. Informant advised he has not engaged in any
illegal activity concerning this loan, but has merely been
the middleman in the transaction involving GEORGE LEVINE's
attempt to obtain refinancing for this corporation.
