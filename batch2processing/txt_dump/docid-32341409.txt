L. BEKRENEV, in a top secret lecture to a Soviet Military Intelligence course
at Military-Diplomatic Academy, 1960, said,

 

"Case officers who use as cover, let.us say, the Soviet Trade
Representation, TASS or Sovinformburo, can use their cover
assignments as backstopping for non-clandestine meetings with
certain agents whose particular activities officially associate
them with the previously mentioned Soviet institutions. However,
such non-clandestine meetings within a legal residency should be.
restricted to a minimum both as ‘to place and time. Meetings of.
this type should be carried out only in exceptional cases with A
tested and reliable agents in order to avoid provocation by the ©
local counterintelligence service against the Soviet installation
being used as cover. Such meetings are held as a rule in the work
offices of the case officer or of the agent during working hours.

  

It is necessary that such meetings be conducted natirally, that °>~ ee

they do not attract the attention of outsiders, and that the receipt |
and transmittal of intelligence matters, properly camouflaged, be
carried out discreetly. In setting up such meetings, measures against
tapping must be taken. One must bear in mind’ithet-a meeting with (2
persons outside official premises and. during ~working hours usually
signifies a relationship between the two. parties that is above and .. .
beyond official matters." URE, .

 

  

 

   

  

Also, such contact in official installations may be caused by the agent's ow
carelessness. Again Admiral BEKRENEV speaks:

 

"Some agents, because of inexperience ‘or, because of deliberate
violation of the rules of security through peculiar personal
rashness,.... approached our case officers at places not stipulated
as operational meeting sites, others ‘telephoned the case officer at.
his Soviet installation and discussed personal” contact arrangements,
while others still showed up personally at the Soviet installation in
order to contact the case officer."

4, I called the above connections to the attention of Mr. Pappich by

phone to his FBI office at 1030 hours on 23 November.

SUBJECT: Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV

a

KOSTIKOV, who was born on 17 March 1933 in Moscow, was
assigned to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City as Vice Consul
on 19 September 1961.

A fluent Spanish speaker, he had travelled abroad at least
three times before this permanent assignment; moreover, in 1959
KOSTIKOV applied for a visa to accompany Premier Nikita Sergeye-
vich KHRUSHCHEV's party to the United States as an official of
the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but we have no record
of his having come to this country at that time. KOSTIKOV
served as an interpreter at international conferences at Madrid
‘and Barcelona in 1958 and 1959. In late 1959 and early 1960
he attended Soviet exhibitions in Mexico City and Havana; he
is known to have been in Cuba from 6 January to 7 March 1960.

The physical description of KOSTIKOV quite accurately fits
that of a Soviet case officer who nearly a year ago met in
Mexico an FBI-controlled double agent. This double agent's
Soviet case officer in the United States has been Oleg Danile-
vich BRYKIN of the Thirteenth Department, KGB First Chief
Directorate, occupying the overt position of translator-trainee,
U.N. Secretariat, New York City. BRYKIN was stationed in New
York City from December 1960 to July of this year.

Since arriving in Mexico, KOSTIKOV is known to have travelled
three times outside the capital: In March 1963 and again for the
first two weeks of September he went to Tijuana, Ensenada, and
Mexicali, ostensibly for the purpose of purchasing cotton. The
U.S. Department of State, however, has reported that during
these trips KOSTIKOV met local representatives of Movimento
Liberation National and Central Compesine Independienta, both
large Communist front organizations. In addition, according to
FBI sources, KOSTIKOV was accompanied on the September trip by
Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERYEV, and he contacted in Ensenada several
persons including Communist sympathizers who previously had been
associated with Soviet officials stationed in Mexico City.

ALFERYEV, a PRAVDA correspondent in Mexico, was in close

contact with Cuban diplomats and local Communist leaders during
a February 1962 visit to Quito.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director, Plans

FROM: Acting Chief, SR Division S

SUBJECT: O Contact of Lee OSWALD with a member of Soviet KGB
: Assassination Department

i. According to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Lee OSWALD
was at the Soviet Embassy there on 28’ September 1963 and spoke with the
Consul, Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV. - This was learned when OSWALD called
the Soviet Embassy on 1 October, identifying himself by name and’ speaking
broken Russian, stating the above and asking the guard who answered the phone
whether there was "anything new concerning the telegram to Washington."

The guard checked and then told OSWALD that a request had been sent, but
nothing had as yet been received. (MEXI 6453, 9 October 1963) The FBI liaison
officer, Mr. Pappich, told me on 23 November that the Bureau has reason to
believe that OSWALD's visit was to get Soviet support for a U.S. passport or
visa matter /perhaps the new passport mentioned in the press articles).

2. KOSTIKOV is an identified_KGB officer. He was a case officer in an
operation which is evidently sponsored by the KGB's 13th Department (responsible
for sabotage and assassination). This operation, which is controlled by the
FBI under the cryptonym TUMBLEWEED, involved a German-national resident of
Oklahoma who was recruited in Europe, and met this year with KOSTIKOV in Mexico
City and shortly thereafter with a known 13th Department officer, Oleg BRYKIN,
in New York. The instructions given TUMBLEWEED by the two officers, (pinpointing
objectives for sabotage) and the circumstances of their involvement in the case,
left no doubt that both of them were working for the same KGB component, the
13th. :
