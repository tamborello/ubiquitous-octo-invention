4. She was given a post office box address to use to contact
the Station in the event that she does return to Mexico

and feels it necessary to do so. _ But no committment was

made to her regarding any future contact or payment for

information.

2. 5. She was previously told that the telephone number of the
~ New York KUBARK office is listed in the directory and

she could call that office if contact were necessary while

 

she was in the United States. She asked if that would
still be the case and was told that it was but only to
: : attempt such contact for an important or urgent matter. ;
: , a But since she tends to liberally apply importance to a
_ wide variety of events and subjects, and since she is
likely to be short of money shortly after arriving, it

would not be surprising if she did try to establish such

contact.

Draft of Dispatch

LICOOKY-1 has been terminated effective 1 July 1966.
The last meeting with her was held on 23 June. She was
paid her salary through 30 June, her income tax refund
for the period 1 January 1965 - 30 June 1966 and given
money fur one-way air fare to New York City. She was

completely satisfied with the financial terms of the

signed in true

settlement. A Termination Secrecy Oath,

name, was obtained.

L-1 plans to return to New York on or about 1 July. She

said she will look for a job there, and is confident she
will have no difficulty obtaining one. Ske does not yet
know where she will be living. :

L-1 is subletting the apartment she occupies here. She

has purchased the KUBARK-owned household effects which
had been loaned to her for that apartment. For this
reason, in addition to the fact that she has acquired
many close friends and interests here as a result of tive
years residence, the Station expects that she. will return

to Hexico, although she insists she has no plans to do

so. ‘
