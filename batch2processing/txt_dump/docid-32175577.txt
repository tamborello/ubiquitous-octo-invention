Memorandum D. Ryan to Mr. Baifley
Re: House Select Committee on Assassinations

Appendix-Volume XIII - MLK

Item 1: On page 117, last paragraph, the panel
report, in paragraph 32, lists the results of fingerprint
comparisons on numerous photographs. In paragraph 33, the
panel report states that the HSCA panel, in examining these
reports, agreed with earlier findings of the FBI. However,
the report stated that "In addition, the panel determined
that the previously unidentified photograph 115, developed
from a. coupon from Eric S. Galt to Modern Photo Bookstore,
bears an impression made by the left thumb of James Earl Ray."

It was pointed out to Mr. Blakey that this sentence
is misleading and incorrect in view of the fact that the FBI
initially identified photograph 115 as an impression of Ray's
left thumb, and therefore the HSCA only confirmed this finding.

Mr. Blakey agreed to make the following changes in
the report: (1) On page 116, under photograph 115, the Q
number of 326 was added in parentheses following the word
"Store"; (2) on page 117, information concerning the identifi-
cation of photograph 115 would be listed in the correct chrono-
logical order under paragraph 32; (3) the sentence in the last
Paragraph on page 117, in paragraph 33, beginning with "In
addition," would therefore be deleted.

Item 2: On page.127, bottom of the page, under item (c),
there appears the sentence|"The FBI received this specime
from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on June 4, 1968. Tw uy
(wy \ [the FBI objected to inclusion of this information
because it disclosed the FBI's relationshipp with a foreign

intelligence service.| Mr. Blakey agreed to delete this
sentence.

Memorandum D, Ryan to Mr. Batley .
Re: House Select Committee on Assassinations

Item 7: On page 217, small paragraph numbered 4, the
report states, "The committee identified the FBI informant
in SCLC without the assistance of the FBI. He acknowledged
his former informant status in a committee interview in which
he was also asked about the nature of his relationship with
the Bureau:"

The FBI objected to this wording because it implied
that the HSCA learned of informant's identity through a
review of FBI files.

Mr. Blakey agreed to a revised wording of this sen-
tence, which is as follows: "The committee learned of the
identity of the FBI's SCLC informant when he acknowledged his
former status in a committee interview. He was asked about
the nature of his relationship with the Bureau;:”

Item 8: On page 240, paragraph 7, the report states
that the FBI‘sS conduct was "morally reprehensible, illegal,
felonious, and unconstitutional." The FBI objected to this
statement in discussing the FBI Counterintelligence Program
because the HSCA, in its report, failed to point out suffi-
cient evidence to warrant such language. Mr. Blakey refused
to make any change in this statement.

Item 9: On page 247, paragraph 1, the report states,
“Washington instructed the FBI legal attache in Ottawa to con-
duct a similar review of Canadian passports, with the assis-
tance of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .|y,a(127)" ~
HU
The FBI objected to this statement (4) use it tended
5 to refer to the FBI's relationship with a foreign intelligence

service. (Z\(u)
Mr. Blakey agreed to revise wording in this para-

graph, which is as follows: "Washington requested Canadian
authorities to review Canadian passport records. . (127)"
