Enclosed letterhead memorandum has been classified
"Confidential" because it contains information from the
above current sources of the PBI. It is felt the un- ;
authorized disclosure of information attributed to these
sources could compromise thesé sources and thus be
injurious to the national defense.

Two copies of this communication are being
forwarded to the Dallas Division in view of their
“interest in this matter.

For the information of the Bureau, subject's
lecture serles entitled "Who Killed Kennedy?" starting
8/25/64, will be covered in a future letterhead
memorandum. .

The pretext on 8/11/64, was conducted by
SA RONALD E. YOUNG of the Citizens’ Committee of :
Inquiry, 156 5th Avenue, NYC, under the guise of being : {
a person interested in attending a LANE lecture.

 

Investigation continuing at New York.
