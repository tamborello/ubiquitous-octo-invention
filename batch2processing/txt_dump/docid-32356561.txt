proposal were:

a.. The majority of the Cuban people are
against Castro, but mainly because of fear they.
-did nothing about it. Castro's primary support
comes from the young teenage militia group.

be. Many high ranking military officers are
anti-Communist and many are convinced Castro must
go but they are afraid to organize or even talk
against Castro to other people. “This fear and
Castro's control of the Government apparatus
(security, military, defense committee, economy,
etc.) make it extremely difficult to organize a
coup against him. : -

ce. if Castro falls, the military will
probably break up into four or five groups.
Without Castro, the present regime will dis-
integrate. Unless there is strong and immediate
support, the situation can easily become chaotic.
Nothing of an operational nature was discussed
at this meeting. After the meeting, CUBELA
stated he was satisfied with the policy discussion
put he now desired to know what technical support
we could provide him. ; :

8. On 19 November 1963 it was decided at
Headquarters that we would advise CUBELA
would receive a cache inside Cuba. If he
requested it, the cache would include sabotage
material, C-4 and equipment, high power rifles
with scopes, hand grenades, pistols, etc.

9. On 22 November 1963, "Sanson" met CUBELA who
asked for 20 hand grenades, two high powered
-pifles with scopes and approximately 20
pounds. of C-4 and related equipment in the
cache. He had refused to carry any in-

20 lbs of C-4 with firing devices and allied
equipment including time pencils and clocks.

 

On 3 May 1964, CUBELA asked for an FAL
silencer. According to the news, the cache
was discovered by a small boy. In February
1965, CUBELA said portions of the cache were
recovered by a fisherman. The pesos were
not usable due to type. He never received
any part of the cache, he said.

‘On 30 August 1964, Jorge Carlos ROBRENO
(AMLASH/2 "El Mago", a-’Cuban refugee in
Madrid, and Cdte.. Efigenio Ameifeiras, Vice
Minister of Special Affairs MINFAR, put out
feelers to AMWORLD saying they were out of

AMBIDDY/1 (Artime). ROBRENO was staying

with Jose Luis GONZALEZ Gallarreta (QUHOPS/1),
an attache at the Cuban Embassy in Madrid. .
Then Alberto BLANCO Romariz (AMLASH/3) arrived
in Madrid on.2 September 1964 as a refugee.
‘He talked to Mr. James.Noel and Anthony
Sileo on 15 September 1964 with Gonzalez
Gallarreta making the introduction. He
spoke vaguely about CUBELA'S plan to-
assassinate Castro. He said that Tepedino
was responsible for delivering. into Cuba one

BLANCO and said their conversation was all

a waste of time. . . :

BIOGRAPHIC DATA — Rolando CUBELA Secades was one of the activist

student leaders who assisted in the overthrow

regime because of disaffection with communism.

As early as March 1952,.CUBELA was working

against Batista. With student friends, including
the four Humboldt Street martyrs made famous
in. the Marcos Rodriguez trial, CUBELA re-instituted
the University Student Federation or Directorate -
FEU or DR, as it is called. In 1956, CUBELA
participated in the assassination of Lt. Col. -
‘Antonio BLANCO Rico of Batista's Military
Intelligence (SIM). Fleeing to the USA, he
_ became involved in military planning and purchasing
arms until 1 February 1958, when he and 16 other
students returned clandestinely and into the

: Escambray to fight. He led a famous column,

-. became the overall DR military leader. Although

the DR joined military forces with Castro's
26 July Movement, they refused Ernesto "Che"
Guevarra's military leadership, fighting only
under CUBELA'S orders. They occupied the :
Presidential Palace when Batista fled on
1 January 1959 and initially declined to turn
it over to Guevara and Castro. In October 1959,
CUBELA became president of the government-

World Youth Festival where he was met by
Tepedino who introduced William Wainwright
under the alias William "Bill" Thompson.
This was a follow up to the first meeting
with the objective of inducing and
facilitating CUBELA'S defection. However,
due to CUBELA'S plans, the objective became
an attempt to set up an internal dissident
group for the overthrow of the Government
and sabotage. CUBELA said. he was not in- con
terested in any small undertaking, and declared.
the assassination of Fidel and other leaders
would be the most effective way to rescue
the revolution from the Conmunists. .

i

3. Later in August 1962 CUBELA "went on vacation"
in Paris where he met "Bill Thompson" again
and KUBARK sought more information on his
proposal to overthrow Castro. CUBELA aiso
discussed the need for the U.S. to become

- more deeply involved with LA students who,
ten years later, would be on the road to
becoming key. figures in LA governments.
Tepedino was present at most of these meetings.

4. In late August-early September 1962, CUBELA -
was taken to a U.S. Air Force Base in
southern France where he was givena
demonstration in explosives. CUBELA had
thought of blowing up an oil refinery and
was also considering the elimination of . .
Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, the Soviet Ambassador,
and Fidel himself. CUBELA was not given any
sabotage equipment but. was trained in SW.
Earl Williamson (true name) accompanied
..__.CUBELA on this trip but was always called
"Jaime by CUBELA. Jack-*Ked" Stent (as
Jack Stevens) and a TSD SW technician under

also accompanied CUBELA.

"Nicolas Sanson". Tepedino was also
at these meetings. CUBELA claimed ‘he had
written two SW messages with FI (one was
received): but nothing significant had ‘bee
happening in Cuba. He said he was reluctant
. to use SW because he feared the efficiency

of the Cuba rpostal censorship.

He cited a group of Cuban military officers
and discussed ways to approach them. The
problem was, he explained, that although
many of them were anti-Communist, they were
loyal to Fidel or they were so afraid, they
were reluctant to discuss any conspiracies
for fear they might be provocations. | CUBELA
. was of the’ opinion that. there was no organized
conspiracy within the military or in other
groups in the country. Internal security
and controls were effective and improving
daily. At this meeting CUBELA volunteered
the information that he thought highly
of Ramon GUIN Diaz (AMTRUNK/10) who was
hiding Miguel DIAZ Isalgue (AMICE/14, an
infiltration asset who was. sent in to recruit |
Guin, and did so). CUBELA said he planned
to use Guin but he was concerned about his
nervous condition and the fact he drank
heavily. CUBELA was told to assist Guin
and let him remain in Cuba rather than help
to leave the country as CUBELA proposed.

From Porto Alegre, CUBELA went to Paris on

14 September 1963 where he met with Tepedino,
"Nicolas Sanson", Jack "Red" Stent, Richard
Long. CUBELA was attending the Alliance ©
