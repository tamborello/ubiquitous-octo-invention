Involvement in Kennedy Assassination %4/-07% £9 4/¢

1. On 31 December 1991, a Soviet,,volunteer to
Station,. Boris Vladimirovich ZHURA , claimed that Lee
Harvey OSWALD was in fact a Ukrainian KGB intel source (code
name Velktor) who had additionally been a controlled agent
of the UKGB. ZHURAVLEV stated that OSWALD had actively
