Il THE DOUBLE AGENT OPERATION:
GENERAL PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS

A discussion of operational details appears in Part V
of this guide, Here the purpose is to present basic infor-
mation and principles about the beginnings of DA operations.
A. Definition.

A double agent is a person who engages in clandestine

_ activity for two intelligence or security services (or more

in joint operations), who provides information about one to
the other or about each to the other, and who is wittingly
withholding significant information from one on the instruc-
tions of the other or is unwittingly manipulated by one so
that significant information is withheld from the other
service, Peddlers, fabricators, and others who do not per-
form a service for an intelligence organization, but only for
themselves, are not agents at all and therefore are not
DA's, As a-rule the DA has an agent relationship with both
services, a fact which distinguishes him from the penetration
agent, who usually serves the CI service as an agent but the
target or adversary service as a staff member or in a staff
capacity. Multiple agents frequently draw a variety of
assignments from several services, Although they may pro-
vide counterintelligence information, and although they
present difficulties in handling and security which resemble
these problems in the double agent operation, the two types
are distinct. The DA is usually directed against a single
adversary, whereas the multiple agent resembles a private
detective with a number of clients.

The part of the definition which stipulates the with-
holding of significant information results from the fact that
an agent who tells everything he knows to both sides becomes,
unless unwittingly manipulated by one of the services, an un-
authorized liaison channel with the enemy. Such situations
are unprofitable and cease to be operations.

B, Types of DA Operations by Origin.

Almost all double agent operations begin in one of three
ways: a walk-in or talk-in, hostile agent detected and
doubled, or a provocation, KUBARK often acquires a DA
case by transfer from another ODYOKE service or from
liaison; when it does, it is important that the type of origin
be included in the information obtained from the transferring
service, A DA case can also result if one service offers
recruitment to the agent of another not because of provoca-
tion or stake-out but by chance,

1, The Transferred Agent,

Analysis suggests that nearly two-thirds of KUBARK's
DA operations begin (for KUBARK) by transfer from another
service, Usually, however, the transferring service merely
made initial contact with a walk-in and turned him over to
KUBARK without having used him operationally, If a going
operation is transferred, it is vital that the base or case
officer accepting jurisdiction obtain the case records of the
prior service, If these are unavailable, knowledgeable
representatives of the transferring service should be de-
briefed as completely as possible. Flaws imbedded in the
operation may make it unsuitable for exploitation or may
require correction, In addition to determining origin, the
KUBARK case officer should obtain the prior service's
assessment of the DA, both as person and as agent, - Even

_ if the case officer considers that the earlier handling was

defective, he should give due weight to such an assessment,
In a few operations KUBARK has repeated the mistakes of
the transferring service through failure to obtain an assess-
ment or through ignoring the earlier record, :

2. The Walk-In and Talk-In,

More than half of KUBARK's DA cases start because
an agent of an adversary service volunteers information to a

‘Field Guide for Double Agent Operations
I, INTRODUCTION

For the past two years KUDESK has been engaged ina
detailed analysis of KUBARK double agent cases. The
results have been collated, and the findings have been dis-
seminated within headquarters in a study which is also
available to the field upon request.

This guide is intended for field use by case officers and
others concerned with DA operations. It represents both
the above research and the views of a number of experienced
and senior KUBARK officers.

If field reporting of double agent operations includes all
essentials discussed here, further research on this subject
will be facilitated and further guidance will result, ina
continuing cycle. . .

‘The comments and views of the users of this guide are
solicited,
