- Details: (U) Details: (U) On 10/26/92, President George Bush

signed the legislation bringing the Act to fruition. The Act
requires that Government records related to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy (JFK) be reviewed and processed for
release and sent to the National Archives for public access.
Congress initiated and passed the legislation because of the
renewed public interest in the history and theories of President
Kennedy’s assassination. The Act facilitates the release of
information normally exempt from disclosure under the Executive
Order and/or the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts (FOIPA).

(U) While the Act contemplates maximum disclosure of
JFK records, certain information may be withheld if it meets the
Board’s interpretation of the Act’s postponement requirements.
The postponement requirements are standards for redactions
established by Congress to limit deletions, }since their
intentions were for all the information to be released by the
year 2017. The only exception to this is if the President of the
United States certifies that unique information should never be

released. Attached is a copy of the Act, which specifies the
basis for.any postponements, defines the requirements of the
Board and their decision making procedures, and the process for
handling the JFK assassination records.

(U) The FBI’s goal and standard operating procedure
under the Act is to maximize the release of information to the
public. Postponements have only been requested where there is
compelling justification for doing so. In July 1995, the Board
began reviewing the FBI’s documents containing postponed
material. The FBI prepared evidence concerning the various
postponements for criminal informants, national security assets,
classified information, and foreign government information.
Concerning the informants and assets, the FBI presented the
judicially accepted legal arguments for protecting the identities
of the informants. However, the Board has not always accepted
our justification for postponement and believed the public
interest outweighed the reason for postponement.

Currently, HERU’s standard operating procedures
include using more liberal guidelines releasing as much
information as possible and providing evidence that notes if the
informant was living, deceased, or if no record could be found
identifiable with the informant. In addition, the Board may
request to review the asset/informant file should they believe
the information provided is germane to the assassination or
theories of the President’s death, which has happened with
information from[™™ 4501-OA7] (6)

[imas01-oa}Was an associate of Antonio Vecianna.
Vecianna had related stories that there was a conspiracy
concerning the Kennedy assassination. The Board is releasing
information from the informant’s file related to the stories
about Vecianna and wants to have evidence as to the assets need:
for protection.
