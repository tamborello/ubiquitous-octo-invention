MR, SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE
OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ; Ae’
DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967

My memorandum of 9/14/67 set forth for the Director's
information data concerning antipoverty workers' involvement in
racial disturbances for his possible use at the forthcoming
luncheon conference mentioned above,

The following additional information received from the
Dallas Office today is being submitted for the Director's
consideration in connection with this luncheon.

PILLD IN Pa. Jos

In response to a request from Mr. Randolf Ratliff,
Director of the Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty in
Dallas, Texas, a representative of this Bureau explained the
FBI's jurisdiction in racial matters to members of Ratliff's
staff, who work in the poverty areas in Dallas County Texas, on’’/
9/6/67, The Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty is funded
by the Office of Economic Opportunity. : H

UNRECORDED COE

On 9/13/67 one of Ratliff's staff workers confidentially
advised that after our representative had left the above meeting,
Ratliff instructed his staff members to give the FBI no informa-
tion and said that the FBI “is the white man's police and they
want nothing but "stool pigeons,'' This individual further
alleged that all of Ratliff's 44 staff members were hand-picked
by Ratliff and that most of them are racial agitators. He
charged that Ratliff and most of the staff members are working
at creating racial incidents in order to stir me local Negro ,

Memorandum to Mr, Sullivan

RE: LUNCHEON ENGAGEMENT OF THE DIRECTOR
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND
MR. SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE
OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY
DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967

communities. He further alleged that Ratliff is the driving
force behind a program of racial agitation in Dallas County
and that his statements to staff members are antiwhite and
antipolice, He said it is his belief that Ratliff is trying
to create a crisis in Dallas in order to receive additional
antipoverty funds.

The source of the above information also alleged
that in April of this year Ratliff was vigorously critical of
the Dallas Police Department regarding the arrest of a 15-year-
old Negro female on a charge of disturbing the peace and was in
the process of organizing a march on city hall to protest the
arrest when officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity
learned of his activity and told him to desist, He stated that
in another instance several months ago, Albert Lipscomb (phonetic),
staff member, learned of a plot by a group of Negro men who were
in possession of rifles and Molotov cocktails to initiate a riot,
He claimed that: Lipscomb personally prevented the riot by calming
the Negro group and personally collecting the rifles and Molotov
cocktails but that when Ratliff learned of Lipscomb's role in
preventing the riot, he officially took credit for the action.
Our source stated that Ratliff unofficially considers Lipscomb
an "Uncle Tom."

The above information is being made available to
Mrs, Stegall at the White House, Mr, Shrivet of the Office of
Economic Opportunity, and the Attorney General by letters dated
9/18/67.

ACTION:

Submitted for the Director's possible use,
