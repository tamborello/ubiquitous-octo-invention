Bear Mr. Hoover:

  

later visited again in 1965 and 1966.

It is of interest to rote that on both of
the latter occasions he was in contact with a representative
of the Nosth Vietnamese Commercial Mission in Paris. This
is ali the more significant, advises the Yrénch, when
it is understood that at that time the North Vietnamese
Commercial Mission handled ali kinds of activities
including intelligence. It was not limited to commercial
matters. This Mission has since heen elevated to the
status of a General Delegation. OY (y

 

   

 

   
   
  
   
  
     
     
    
   
     

In 1958, this person requested accreditation
for "Time" magazine and gave a Paris residence. On pow
June 21-23, 1969, he gave the Hotel Iinter¢ontinental,
Paris, as his address and on June 29, 1969, he gave
the Hotel George V, Paris, as his place of abode . P¢5(U)

 

As I previously advised you this person is not
now officially assigned or accredited as a correspondent in

Dear ‘Mr. Hoover: Lesenh Laath ee ;
I heard from Legat Philcox this morning. In

regard to the man in Paris in whom we are interested,
facts are these;

1) He registered at the hotel on June 29 and as
previously indicated plans to leave next Monday. He has
no regular assignment in Paris and comes and goes througzrout

Europe. |

2) Because of the hotei he is staying in and the
elaborate switchboard, it is not -possibie to put a telephone
surveillance on his room extension. ;

3) I told Philcox to push the French and see if “
we could get a microphone in his room. This they are trying
to do. The question was raised as to whether they should
take anyone at the hotel into confidehce should it be necessary
in order to place the installation. I said,no do not take
anyone into confidence at the hotel.

I am folowing this matter very closely and yo
will be kept advised. .

Respectfully submitted,

Dear Mr. Hoover:

 

 

Tnis is to advise you that the French
have overcome some very difficult operational
problems and have installed a microphone in this
fellow's room. As I mentioned yesterday the
elabcrate switchboard prevents using a telephone
surveillance. Qs5Cu)

Just as soon as they get an adequate
product, it will be sent into me irmediately and
I will handle the translatior under very secure
conditions.

 

You will kept promptly advised of fen
developments.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

 

In regard to the columnist we discussed this
morning, I have learned that hig wife and daughter are
presently en route to Paris. All three will be leaving
Paris on Monday, July 7, 1969, for a three-week vacation
touring Italy. Following this, he intends to go on to
. Bucharest and to Moscow. Tt is assumed that the Bucharest,
Romania, visit will be in connection with President Nixon's
presence there. He intends to return to the United States
August 10, 1969, by way of Paris.

 

As of the moment, efforts are being made to get Ker
the installation in, If the switchboard at the hotel
makes a technical surveillance impossible, an effort will

2 be made to place a microphone in his room,

ARIS—President Nixon's forth-

coming visit to Roniania repre-
” sents a break from the administra-
tion's central policy of swectening
up the Russians for a super-duper

i diplomatic big deal. And because

> the visit to a Communist dissident
‘departs from the Moscow First po-

| Uey, it looks like big-league stuff.

: + But the Bucharest stopover can
. ‘be truly important only if Wash-
ington follows up with a more
forthcoming attitude toward other

. Communist dissidents—notably in
Ching and in North and South
Vietnam. And the probability is

+ that instead of following up, Mr.
Nixon will content himself with a
showy visit that will be seen, in
retrospect, to have been much exe
aggerated.

The Moscow First policy of the
Nixon administration can be seen
in every corner of the world, but
most of all in the corner of the
world inhabited by the dissident

| Communists of Eastern Europe. *

«Backward on Trade
! fhe Nixon administration has
; gone backward, not forward, on
* East-West trade, the prime Ameri-
can vehicle for knitting up rela~
* tions with the East European coun-
tries, As ambassadors, it has con-
ferred open those nations regular
foreign Service officers with no
qlout in Washington, who, besides,
fee Eastern Europe chiefly as an
{aiunct of either Russian or Ger~
ian policy.

A particularly striking example
of the disposition of the Nixon ad-
ministration to subordinate Eastern.
Europe to Sovict policy came
in connection with the ouster
of Alexander Dubcek, the in-
deperdent-minded former First
Secretary of the Czech Com-
mvunist party, A few hours

« after Dubcek wes sacked, Washing~
tion announced that it had warned
1 Moscow about such a change. By
{ publishing the warning after rather
i than before the dirty deed had
been done, the Nixon administra~
} tion made it plain beyond any doubt
: Just how unwiiling i¢ has been to
lay its prestige on the line for the
- sake of an East European state
. at odds with Russia.

The same pattern is apparent in
dealings with the major rebel in
the Communist camp. Shortly af-
ter Mr. Nixon was elected, the Chi-
nese Communists extended an olive
branch in the’ form of an invita-
tion to renew the Sino-American
mectings in Warsaw,

Mr, Nixon brushed off this over-
ture at his first presidential press
, conference, His administration, de-
. Spite hroad Chinese hints of trouble
, to come, then took over a Chinese

agent who had defected to Holland.

Though it was Peking that can-
+ eeled the scheduled Warsaw meet~
ing, the general opinion among
: Communist countries—notably Ay
» Homanla—was that the Nixon age
8 inistration had spurned a Chinese

& Visit to Bucha

By Joseph Kraft.

In the Near East. the Nixon ad-

 

ministration has played patsy for:

the Russians even more cgregiously,
Soviet chestnuts are in the fire
there because of the humiliation of
Moscow's Arab proteges by Isracl,
and the closing of Russia’s gateway
to Arabia and East Africa—the
Suez Canal.

But Washington has been run-
ning after the Russians in Big Two
and Big Four sessions on the Near
East as though American interests
in the area were in jeopardy. Why?
Not because there is a chance of
settling the conflict between Israel
and the Arabs, as the jatest word
from Cairo makes abundantly clear,
On the contrary, Weshington’s ob-
jeclive has been a political cease-
fire in the Near East between the
United States and Russia that
would open the road to a wider
Big Two deal.

Precisely the same logic runs
through the president’s policy in
Western Europe. True to the word
passed on his visit here last spring,
Mr. Nixon has been at great pains
not to interfere in West European
business, and to consult the allies
on larger strategic questions, Why?
Because basically what the presi-
dent wants from Western Europe
and notably from France and
West Germany—is a clear road for
doing business with the Russians,

Nor has there been any mystery
about what the business is suppos-
ed to be. The subject of the admin-
istration’s most intense and elaho-
rate planning and staffing effort
has been the coming strategic arms
limitation talks with the Russians.
And despite repeated evidence that
the présent leadership in Moscow

is unsure of itself, Washington has
been approaching these talks as
though they would provide the big-
gest diplomatic deal of all time,
the capstone to détente—"a quali-
tative change in relations between
Russia and the United States,”
as one very high American official
has phrased it,

Given that single-minded focus
on doing a deal with Russia, the
president's forthcoming visit to
Romania is a mere tactical baga-
telle, a slight deviation from the
main path in order to put more
‘pressure on Moscow. To be truly
important, the Bucharest visit
would have to yield a change of
stance In Washington. The Nixon
administration would have to show
Willingness to treat with the other
Communist dissidents—the Chinese,
the North Vietnamese, and, most
important of all now, the Provi-
sional Revolutionary Government
of South Vietnam.

Bucharest is obviously going to
put to Mr. Nixon the case for poly-
centric dealing by Washington with
the whole Communist world. Butt
whether Mr, Nixon will respond re4
mains in doubt. In the past, any+
how, he has shown a lamentable,
Weakness for highly-publicized in-
ternational meetings that lead no-
where.

Moreover, much as the balance
of American dealings with the Com-
munist world needs to be righted
in favor of the dissidents,-there is
a central strategic fact that keeps
asserting the importance of Big
Two relations. That fact is that
Russia and the United States—
but not anybody else—can blow up
the world.
