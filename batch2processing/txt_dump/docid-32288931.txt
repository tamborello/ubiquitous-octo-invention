ENCLOSURES:

TO BUREAU

Original and one copy of a letterhead’ memorandum
characterizing informants utilized in this report.

ADMINISTRATIVE:

Because of the volume of investigative material being

‘accumulated at Miami, the Miami- office will now submit pending.

reports in this case.

Referenced Tampa report of 2/9/67 refers to the Miami
fisur of the subject making a telephone call from a public '

telephone booth in Miami, This telephone call was of a very

short duration and appeared to be local. in nature, as the
subject made no unusual deposit of-coin for the call. The Miaini
office feels that a Jreview!of*the:toll calls charged to this

telephone would be unnecessary at. this time. -
