Miscellaneous

The April 7, 1962, edition of the "Daily Dispatch," a daily
newspaper published in New Kensington, Pa., carried an
article captioned “MANNARINO Las Vegas Link Cited." This
article set out that on the preceding day MICHAEL MAC. DOUGALL,
an Investigator, Nevada Gaming Control Board, in a speech
before the Chemical Sales Association in Pittsburgh, stated
that the "MANNARINO miob of New Kensington, Pa.," is one of
several racket combines having financial interests in Las
Vegas gambling casinos. He said that "gangsters" such as
the MANNARINOs, remnants of the Detroit Purple Mob, Egan's
Rats from St. Louis, WILLIE MORETTI's mob, FRANK COSTELLO's
men, and "Greasy" GUZIK's outfit, have pieces of some Las
Vegas casinos. :

E. LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISES
on April 25, 1962, PG 1-39 advised:

Recently, MIKE GENOVESE stated that “the mob" is planning to
puild a large motel in the Monroeville, iPas,.area, but they
are having trouble with the zoning laws, According to
GENOVESE, ARCHIE NELSON is the front man in connection with
this motel, but NELSON is being packed by the MANNARINOs and
the LA ROCCA groups

On May 11, 1962, PG T-2 advised as follows:

On May 9, 1962, While at the Bonfire Restaurant, Route 58,
Teechburg, Pa., MANNARINO stated he was in "dire need of
money." He said he recently flew to New York City with an
unnamed friend in an effort to borrow money put had no

success. MANNARINO claimed he had over $1,000,000 worth of
property but could not borrow anything-on it. He said he was
thinking of attempting to sell the restaurant and the property
where the Family Drive-In Theater was located. MANNARINO
claimed the Ken Iron and Steel Company scrap metal business

4n New Kensington was costing him too much to operate; ‘He’
complained that the scrap metal for which he had paid $40.00
per ton is now only selling for $20.00 per ton. MANNARINO
4ndicated he would like to close.down this operation for a while,
put he feared that he would get a much smaller price for an
inactive property should he convince the City of New Kensington
to buy it. Informant suggested MANNARINO burn the place down,
and MANNARINO replied he had thought of it but knows that

He has heard SAM MANNARINO attempting to convince drug store
owners and chain managers to install F & F Lozenges, using
the sales approach that these lozenges, which sell for 10¢
can be purchased for 5¢ while Life Savers cost 8¢ and only
sell for 10¢. However, the individuals MANNARINO has talked
to in informant's presence are not enthusiastic about
accepting his product, and it would appear that this business
is not doing as well as MANNARINO had hoped. Recently, SAM
MANNARINO said that he was going to install a golf driving
range at the road side on his tract of land near Route 58,
Allegheny Township, Westmoreland County, Pas

F, PENDING PROSECUTIVE ACTION

There is no known pending prosecutive action against SAMUEL
MANNARINO at this time. However, a Federal Grand Jury
continues to sit from time to time in Pittsburgh, Pao,
conducting an inquiry into the activities of the MANNARINO
organization.

ARCHIE NELSON and their respective lieutenants. Informant
stated he would make an effort to ascertain where such a
meeting place could be.

On May 22, 1962, PG T-39 advised:

From inquiries he has made as casually as possible among

minor racketeering figures in the Pittsburgh area, he has
determined to his own satisfaction that the leading racketeering
figures in Western Pennsylvania meet occasionally in Rooms 39-40,
a bridal suite, at the Phoenix Motel, Monroeville, Pa. MIKE
GENOVESE, who is considered as the top lieutenant in the JOHN

LA ROCCA organization, has invited informant to attend a

_ gathering on Thursday evening, May 24, 1962, at the Phoenix

Motel, and GENOVESE stated that the MANNARINOs and LA ROCCA
would probably. be present. Informant has no idea of the
purpose of this or any other meeting.

On May 2, 1962, PG T-35 advised: \

During the week before and the week after Easter, 1962,

GABRIEL MANNARINO, SAMUEL MANNARINO, ROMEO LENZI of Vandergrift,
Pa., and one (FNUS VOLPE of Wilmerding, Pa., met in the

21 Room of the Sea Gull Hotel, Miami Beach, Florida, for the
purpose of discussing a recent trend in which politicians were
bypassing the top racket figures in favor of direct dealings
with the individual bookies. They hoped, through their
discussion, to come up with a way in which they could get

these politicians "back in line." Informant is not aware of
the actual result of this discussion.

‘Gambling ;

On May 23, 1962, PG T-3 advised:

Currently, rumors are circulating among gamblers in the New
Kensington, Pa., area that the MANNARINOs have somehow

"gotten to" Mayor EDWARD ZALESKI of New Kensington, Pa., and
that gambling will again flourish in the city in approximately
two weeks. These rumors are to the effect that the city will
be "re-opened" and that the craps, barbout, card and other
games will resume. However, nobody seems to know as yet
whether these activities will take place at the former casino
located in the Garibaldi Building, New Kensington, or at some
new Location.
