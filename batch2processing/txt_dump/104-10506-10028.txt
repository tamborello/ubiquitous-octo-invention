CHRONOLOGY OF FINDINGS

Anti-Castro Activities - Cuba 19-9-9

HVCA 11020 dated 28 February 1964

A Caracas Station asset reported an operation called
“Plan Judas" being constructed at that time inside
Cuba. The plan reportedly involved an internal
uprising with the support of certain Cuban military
figures conspiring against Fidel CASTRO. Key figures
reportedly included Juan ALMEIDA, Efigenio AMEIJEIRAS
Delgado, Pepin NARANJO, Regino BOTTI, and two COSSIO
brothers. On 24 February 1964, Francisco SUAREZ
Quinones, a JURE (Revolutionary Junta) member in
Caracas, told U.S. Embassy officials that JURE was
then sponsoring a plan to assassinate Fidel CASTRO and
other high-ranking Cuban Government officials as part
of an operation designed to incite an internal rebellion
in Cuba. The Station reported this plan, speculating

that it may be connected in some way with Plan Judas.

DBA 77673 dated 15 July 1964 (FBI)

Reported plan of Cuban exile leaders to assassinate
selected Cuban Government leaders. Individuals involved
included Byron CAMERON, owner of m.v. "Cayman Hope,"

on the basis of these data, including the heading Findings.
This heading lists the specific document number (s) and
other pertinent data, and a few lines providing the gist
of the document (s) for purpose of easy and quick

subject, in hard-back green folders as part of the official
LAD/JFK Task Force files under the official classification
number 019-604-001 (Volumes XI through XX). Also included
in the records are two folders (Volumes IX and X) con-

of the Senate Select Committee Final Report on the
Assassination. (Book V, and a 23 May 1967
Memorandum for the Record by the Inspector General
on Plots to Assassinate Fidel Castro, were required
reading for the researchers.) In addition to the
Terms of Reference, the group remained alert to other
items of interest brought to its attention by the IG
staff, on an ad hoc basis. A name trace was always
run, and/or 201 dossier, if available, reviewed, on
any individual allegedly involved in an assassination
plot against President Kennedy or Fidel Castro. This
task was made somewhat easier as the result of a
memorandum prepared by the Cuba Desk, in August 1975,
based on traces of the names in the Black Book that
Fidel Castro passed to George McGovern which dealt
with individuals allegedly involved in assassination
attempts against Castro.

c. Findings and Organization of the Findings:

Each researcher submitted a draft paper noting the

Subject of the folder (s) reviewed, a brief description of the
activity, and a copy of the document (s) (findings) which
contained information believed to be pertinent to the re-
view. Also included were Job numbers, Official File
numbers, inclusive dates of material researched, and
number of volumes reviewed. Beginning in January 1977, at
the request of the IG Staff, the researchers also began

noting FBI and/or other government agencies knowledge of

SUBJECT: Latin America Division/JFK Task Force How

Research was Conducted

1. The LA Division Task Force to investigate records
in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy
was formally organized in mid-October 1976. Its purpose,
basically, was to research all Agency operations conducted
against Cuba from 1 January 1960 to 1 January 1965
(concentrating on the period up to 22 November 1963) for
any evidence that such operations might have provoked the
Government of Cuba to take executive action against

President Kennedy. Researchers were also alert to activities

seemingly directed against the U.S./CIA.

2. Reference to material for this research was obtained
from the LAD Registry, the Cuba Desk machine runs, and a
special comprehensive file listing prepared for this purpose
by ISS (Information Services Staff). It was originally
thought that material pertinent to the search would number
approximately 900 operational folders, plus related 201
dossiers. It was later determined, however, that a thorough
review should include additional operational and subject
files which brought the total to well over two thousand files.

In view of the date of the material, much of it, both operational

at Headquarters. This material is easily retrievable
through the use of specific job numbers and file reference

files (too numerous to cite herein.)
