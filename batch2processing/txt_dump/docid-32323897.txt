apparently has untold resources and that he is most
anxious and willing to underwrite any @nterprise so
long as he can be assured of a ten percent profit on
his investment. CIVELLO reportedly complains that he
is hurting financially because the trial concerning the
Apalachin meeting cost him between $35,000 and $50,000.

&® loud-mouth "Da; 3" who talks too wich at times and whe could
be used Ag back hen up ageinst the wall te force cooperation.

PCI stated FRANK TOR'TORIBLIA bears considerable
watching as he appears to be loaded with money, is very
clese to JOB CIVELLO sna mekes frequent and numerous trips
to Chicago (probably runner). PCr has stated that CIVELLO
has been backing the Pedigo’s Drive-In Grocery, approximately
6 to 7 throughout Dallas. He is presently financing the
construction of a big Pedigo Drive-In Grocery #¢ the inter-
section of Fitzhugh and ‘Cole.

PCI stated that approximately 2 ot 4 months ago he

was looking for a drive-in grocery himself and had made

prelimiaary negotiations with the Meteger Dairy people to

assist in a financing of 4 new location. While he was

negotiating for this new location he was contacted by JOE

CIVELLO whom he knew of previously, but did not know personally.

CIVELLO told him that he had heard that he was interested in

going into.the drive-in grocery business and that he should

deal with CIVELLO as CIVELLO could finance everything and

anything be needed. As & result of this contact with CIVELLO

he met CIVELLO at CIVELLO’s instructions each day at approxi-

mately 9 AM at the “pump” (Gulf Station on Ross) and they

would ride around town looking for new locations. This went

on for approximately 1 weeks. PCI stated that a decision

was made for him to open up #2 drive-in grocery at the inter-

section of Inwood and Lemmon Avenue. CIVELLO would put up

$90,000 to lease the property and PCI would have to pay

$400 @ month rent for the property over a 5 year period

with a 5 year option for renewal. PCI stated that CIVELLO

is extremely cagey and non-ccosmittal and when he came to draw

up the contract PCI was concerned as CIVELLO’s name did not }
_ appear anywhere in the transaction. He inquired of CIVELLO ;
- @s$ to where he would stand if the thing fell through acd

CIVELLO told him that he would have no worry that he, CIVELLO,

would take care of everything for him. PCI stated that ~
CIVELLO wants a minimum of 10% profit from all investments of f

this type he undertakes. Before the contract was fully
7 negotiated there was some difficulty in the actual obtaining
” of the property, therefore, PCI was able to get out of -
the agreement. He was having considerable trouble by his . \ '
wife's pressure being brought on him not to negotiate with Yoo
CIVELLO and this was @ graceful way for him_-not to deal with
CIVELLO. PCI stated that , PE i \
