IDENTIFICATION OF PHOTOGRAPHS (Cuban diplomatic in-
stallation)

8. In view of the departure from Mexico of LITAMIL/9,.
who in the past has made most LIONION photo identifica-
tions, the. Station feels that the bulk of the LIONION
photographs should perhaps be quickly transmitted to
JMWAVE for review by such assets as AMMUG/1 and AMNIP/1.
As with previous transmittals of LIONION photographs to
Headquarters, the pulse camera films would be processed
only through the negative stage by the Station and

printing would have to be done in PBPRIME.

3. It will be recalled that in the hast progress report

{see above ] the Station requested Headquarters and JMWAVE

views on forwarding LIONION photographs to JMWAVE. This
request was promptly answered by HMMW 13645 and photo-
graphs have accordingly been sent to JMWAVE which, by
having AMMUG/1 screen them, has already made one impor-

tant DGI identification.
