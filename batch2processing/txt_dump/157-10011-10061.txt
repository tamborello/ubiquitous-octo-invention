information before they heard from us and they do not reference
in here the Exhibit 4 which tells them to discontinue the
operation or to not pursue the matter.

This was apparently sent before they had received
Exhibit 4, and their contact in which they had, in which they
had discussed what could be done as a harassment during the
flight, they had discussed this prior to the receipt of our --
of my Exhibit 1.

Mr. Kelley. Does it appear to you that that cable,
Hinkle Exhibit 5, refers to an assassination or to harassment
and water ditching, and maybe making the trip abort, but
not kill anybody?

Mr. Hinkle. That would be, that would appear to be
correct.

Mr. Kelley. You testified earlier that the station

in its two earlier cables, I believe Hinkle Exhibits 2 and 3,

 

did not, was not suggesting assassination or looking for
authority to assassinate?
Mr. Hinkle. Reading Exhibits 2 and 3 at this point,

that is correct.

Mr. Kelley. And as Hinkle Exhibit No. 6 we will mark

a routing and record sheet, form 610 from

dated January 17, 1975, to the Deputy Director for Operations

 

 

and the Inspector General, and attached to that is a memorandum

for the Inspector General, dated January 17th, 1975, through
