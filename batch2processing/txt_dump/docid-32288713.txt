’ Prosecutors contemplate subpoenaing other persons
who were threatened by ALDERISIO even though those persons
refuse to discuss it. The strategy is that the presence
of these people around the courtroom would discourage
ALDERISIO taking stand in his own defense which would be
an advantage to the prosecution.

: will probably subpoena|_——_—idtand
from Los Angeles, and’ probably SEGAL, who
was threatened by ALDERISIO in New York City. New York

and Los Angeles advised of this as victim might contact that |
office and prosecutors will probably be in’ phone contact with is,
these witnesses and might subpoena New York agents who an
worked on SEGAL matter.

 

By radiogram dated 10/6/64, Bureau was requested 4
to locate fingerprint card on EGAN'’s U. S; Air Force
enlistment and forward serial number to St. Louis, in order
that EGAN’s service record might be checked.

BRAY obtained. $200,000. loan from Exchange National Bank

on loan was his assignment of anticipated commissions from
United Benefit Fire Insurance Co. and Oxford Agency, which
he expected to earn by writing bonds for the Teamsters Union.

Chicazo is requested to contact Exchange National
Bank and obtain a summary of the records they have relating
to this transaction as well as identify person who could
testify to same, since prosecutors may desire to issue «2
subpoena duces tecum on matter. -<
