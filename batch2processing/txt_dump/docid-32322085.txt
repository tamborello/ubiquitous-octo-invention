Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection
* Act of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The JFK Task Force (JFKTF) requests Chicago to search
for records and forward records to the JFKTF.

Enclosure: ARRB letter requesting material; copy of EC forwarded
to Chicago on 3/24/1998 and attachments.

OC Details: In 1992, Congress signed the Act mandating federal
agencies to release all documents concerning the presidential
assassination or information related by conspiracy theory to the
assassination. The Act narrowly defined the types of information
that agencies could still protect by postponement until the year
2017. The Act also established the Board as a separate entity to
oversee the release of material from federal agencies to the
National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Beyond the
Board's oversight responsibilities, the Act charged the Board
with the duties of reviewing agencies' proposed postponements
with the agencies' evidence for approval or denial and
researching additional areas of information for any new material
related to the assassination. The FBI has been working with the
Board since its inception to meet the requirements of the Act.

On November 29, 1996, the Board wrote a letter to the

FBI setting forth a formal compliance program. The letter
requested the FBI's cooperation with the Board “in discharging
its responsibility of assuring Congress and the American people
that the goals of the JFK Act will be accomplished to the
greatest reasonable extent.” The compliance program is the
Board's answer to demonstrating “to the American public that a
thorough, good-faith, and diligent effort has been made to locate
and release all remaining assassination-related records within
the control of the United States government (and that the

‘ Government is not hiding any such materials from public

‘C) disclosure).” With this philosophy in mind, the Board has
forwarded letters to the FBI requesting additional information

for their review and possible inclusion in the JFK collection. |

On March 23, 1998, the JFKTF received a letter from the
Board requesting field files from Chicago regarding Harry Dean.
By EC dated 03/24/1998, the JFKTF requested Chicago to search for
files and references to Harry Dean and to forward any responsive
documents to the JFKTF. Records of the JFKTF do not indicate a
response from Chicago. '

The original documents are necessary to meet the
requirements of the Act. Should the Board determine the
documents to be assassination records the originals will

_ eventually be transferred to NARA. Therefore, any responsive

documents should be copied before forwarding to the JFKTF. If

the Board decides the documents do not fall within the realm of
the Act, the documents will be returned to your office, but not
until the Board completes this project.

Chicago should respond even if the search is negative.
The response is important for the FBI's compliance with the Act.
If you have any questions, please contact Catherine Lamey at
(202) 324-6185.
