Assassination Records Review Board

Request for Unescorted Official Visitor Badge

ADDENDUM: _ SECURITY COUNTERMEASURES SECTION  (SCMS
NATIONAL SECURITY DIVISION (NSD 6/26/95 FEB: feb

 

The Security Programs Manager (SPM), SCMS, approves the
request for an unescorted Official Visitor Badge for
Assassination Record Review Board (ARRB), employee Tammi S. Long,
DOB 6/1/68, POB Brooklyn, New York, SSAN 249-21-0975. Ms. Long
will be reviewing records relating to the assassination of former
President John F. Kennedy, and will therefore need access to Room
6712 on a daily basis for approximately one year. Ms. Carol L.
Keeley, Extension 9465, Room 6712, is the point of contact for
Ms. Long.

On 6/26/95, appropriate FBIHQ record checks were
conducted on Ms. Long by a representative of the
Industrial/Facility Security Unit (I/FSU), SCMS; no derogatory
information was disclosed.

 

On 6/20/95, a representative of the SCMS verified that
Ms. Long has the appropriate clearance, term certified for a
period of one year, to be granted unescorted access to FBIHQ and
to be granted access to classified material up to and including
Top Secret. It should be noted, barring additional changes,
Ms. Long's clearance certification will expire 6/19/96, prior to
which time it will have to be recertified for her to continue to
have unescorted access to FBIHQ.

It is requested that Ms. Keeley return Ms. Long's badge
to the Security Unit, Personnel Division, Room 1127, at the
completion of her assignment. Ms. Keeley should also notify
Ms. F. Brice, I/FSU, SCMS, Extension 6875, when Ms. Long no
longer requires access to the J. E. H. Building so I/FSU records
can be updated accordingly.
