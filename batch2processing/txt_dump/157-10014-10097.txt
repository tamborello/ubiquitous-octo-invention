The Hanorable Edvard H. Levi
The Attorney General
Washington, DB. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

: On May 12, 1975, I wrote to you making a general request
for documents in the possession of the Department of Justice
| (inetuding the FBI) which relate to the subject of plasued or
attespted or actual assagsinations. JI also specifically referred;
te a Justice Department file relating to the possible prosecution:
of ea Mr. Gianeana, and perhaps of others, for an allegedly illegai<.
wiretap. On May 20, 1975, Departuent of Justice file #82-16-5

   
  

review by Messrs. Schvars and Smothers. On June 3, 1973, five
additional documents vere made available to Messrs. Schwars and
Smothers at the Department of Justice. From our counsels' review
of the foregoing, it appears that there must be certain additional
documents ineluding:

(1) @ memorandum written ty Former Director Hoover
reflecting a meeting between him and Former Attorney General
Robert F. Kennedy on May 9, 1962; and

(2) underlying material seflecting an interview or
interviews by the FBI of Mr. Sheffield Edwards, formerly
Director of Security of the CIA and Robert Mehwu, » suspect

  

: % appears that there must be seme such under~
ae from our uoderstanding under usual practice,
; it appears that the description of such interviews in the
: May 22, 1961 memorandum sent to the Justice Department by the FBI
is slightly different than the description of those matters in the
Mareh 6, 1967 letters from Mr. Wannall to Mr. Sullivan end from
the Director of the FBI to the Attornay General.

jie te our instructions, the Chief Counsel has
already ‘infirantly requsted the shove material but I understand

: % you wanted « letter from the Committee iteelf, Accordingly,
foday the Comittee untoimeusly concluded that a1) the decunents
referred te above should be delivered,

The matter ve ve are investigating is of utmost sapartance
under cur mandate. The President has, moreover,
Committees and the publie thes all the seterial Gill be delivered
to us. Obviously we will handle the uaterial with the appropriate
care as required by our Rules and agreements.

Since the material (or at least the parts specified

above) is already collected, we would expect that it could be
delivered forthwith.

Sincerely yours,

Frank Charch
Chairman :

 

Of course, it is possible that counsels’ netes, based upon
reading of both seta of documents, are incomplete but that simply
illustrates way it ia se important that the Committes have the
satual documents.
