Gn 11/15/60, alis! Bender; met with Ray in complete privacy.
"Unquestio: > the & smassuming,. almost—huntle Ray.

is.a natural leader of highest intellect, deepest sincerity ani convietion."

Ray's political posture doubtful as far as U.S. government acceptance is
concerned.

Expleined to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all Cuban exiles
unified in their efforts. Ray..says MEP does not wish to reinstate 1950
constitution. Provisional goveramant of 30 honorable Cubans would be
established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passed
at beginning of his regime to be promlgated. State would regulate -

private investment and utilities would be nationalized.

Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" -~ each member to have specific
responsibilities ani feel important to revolution.

Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba ani U.S. Also
asked for $10,000 by next Wednesday -- Bender made conumitment.

- believes net result of meeting was establishment of private MRP-

“ 78. Tink and door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD.
Ray agrees to discuss this with Miro Cardona. -Of all the groups being
supported, FRD, MRP and MRR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem
to be looking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of
the above three. How long current flexibility can be maintained is

problematical.

Subject: Meeting with King and Esterline on subject of handling
MRP, 11/18/60

Consensus was that Ray did not politically represent anything to cheer
about. Writer felt MRP opposed to joining FRD and recognized need to
control MRP and wean it away to the extent possible from its leaders.
Could be done by controlling financial and military support. It was
agreed in meeting with Mr. Barnes that financial and military support

for MRP be channelled through FRD.

Subject: Alleged "New York Times" Publicity Build-up for Manolo Ray

Hal Hendrix, Scripps-Howard L.A. correspondent believes NY Times publicity
buildup for Ray in full swing. Tad Szule reporting Ray's war movements from
Miami. Also with Szulc is close friend, Hemry Raymont of the Times.

Henirix said Times playing up Ray while downplaying Artime and Gutierrez
Menoyo. Think's Times exaggerating Ray's plans to teke teams of highly
trained guerrillas into Cuba, and that Ray's “war” is little more than an
MGM-type New York Times production so far. .

months. Primary purpose today is (a) assassination of top leaders in Castro
regime and (B) sabotage of important industriel and government installations
in Havana. Strength of MRP in Havana estimated to exceed 1,000 -- success

to get rid of Castro. Claimed that prior to invasion, is was possible to
puy almost anything in Cuba from Castro officials -- they were tainted by
corruption. Since Castro's victory at Bay of Pigs, his popular support is
estimated to be around 80-85%. Most support is out of fear because the
people believe he will be in power permanently. Borja said DRE outside of
