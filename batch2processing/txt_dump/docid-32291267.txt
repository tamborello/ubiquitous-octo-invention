still possesses some control and authority at the Fontaine-

hotel, was successful in having the mortgages on the Fon-
tainebleau Hotel refinanced by the Guarantee Life Insurance
Co. of New York City and is now out of the "red". He stated

ROSENBERG, owner of Star Liquors in New York City, and SONNY
ZEEMAN, also connected with Star Liquors.
