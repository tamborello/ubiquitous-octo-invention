Airtel to Miami
Re: MM

approximately 13 members of the Bonanno and Gambino "families"
were in attendance. Among those he identified were Paul Vario
and Carmine Tramunti. It is noted Bureau sources have
reviously reported these two individuals are members of the

chese "family." The informant should be pressed for full
details regarding this meeting, including its exact location
and identity of all in attendance.

 

mu(__c-re has also stated that Joe Bonanno fox
maintained “execution squads" throughout the country and s
specifically in Los Angeles, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Chicago, :
and eisewhere. The informant should be interviewed in detail
pn gana this situation in an effort to obtain complete
details.

It is recognized that the informant, as a veteran
hoodlum, has an exceptional potential to assist the Bureau.
Interviews with him should be aimed at obtaining very precise
information regarding his knowledge and possible involvement
in LCN activity. ©

In reporting the results of the interview of MM
concerning this matter, designate copies for Bureau file 4,
"La Cosa Nostra, AR - Conspiracy," and the New York Office.

The above-captioned source should be interviewed in
detail regarding his knowledge of La Cosa Nostra (LCN)
activity in an effort to obtain clarifying data with respect
to information he has previously furnished regarding this
underworld organization.

This source has reported that he was "made" a member
of the Bonanno “family” approximately 20 years ago, however, he
stated there was no initiation ceremony involved in connection
with his induction. It is noted that his account of becoming
a member of the Bonanno "family" substantially differs from
that furnished by other Bureau sources who are members of the
Bonanno "family." These sources have advised there was a
formal ceremony at the time they became full-fledged members.

The Bureau's experience in connection with the
development of member-informants in LCN discloses that some of
these sources are initially reluctant to provide intimate
details of their initiation, however, with additional well-
planned interviews, these source have furnished complete
information regarding the specific circumstances existing when
they became members of LCN.

Miami airtel to the Bureau and New York dated 9/5/67,
entitled "La Cosa Nostra, AR - Conspiracy" advises the
informant furnished information regarding an LCN meeting which
he attended on Long Island, New York. This source reported
