The following agencies were contacted for the purpose
of effecting close liaison and to determine what action these
agencies were taking to prevent the departure of unauthorized
anti-CASTRO raiding groups from the San Juan area:

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) TYRUS E,
MINNIX, Deputy District Director, advised his office in San Juan
has received no instuctions regarding steps he should take
to prevent the departure of unauthorized anti-CASTRO rading
groups. He stated he would contact his office in Miami, Florida,
regarding the crew of the "Angelina" and would request the Miami
office of INS to obtain from the coordinator of Cuban affmirs their 4:.-
vice relative to the serving of prevention of departure notices
on the members of the crew of the "Angelina." He stacea that the
serving of this notice is the only action which his agency can
take to discourage unauthorized anti-CASTRO raids. He also
advised he would, in the future, take the same steps regarding
any aliens that came to his attention as possibly being involved
in plans to initiate raids against Cuba.

U. S. Coast Guard - RICHARD J. HIGHSTREET, Captain
of the Port Office, advised the Coast Guard is periodically
boarding the "Angelina" so that the crew of the "Angelina"
will be aware that the Coast Guard does not intend to allow
that boat to leave the island with arms aboard.

Guard does mt have specific plans to discourage anti-CASTRO

U. S. Customs - JESUS M, MARTINEZ, Customs Agent
in Charge, and MANUEL F. CASANOVA, Assistant Customs Agent
in Charge, advised the interest of their agency lies in possible
violations of the Neutrality Act by the exportation of arms
or munitions from San Juan for the purpose of carrying out
acts of aggression against Cuba. In this regard, they
stated they had boarded the "Angelina" on two occasions and
had not encountered any arms or munitions. They stated that
on receipt of specific information relating to planned departures
of exiled groups from San Juan in the possession of arms or
munitions, their agency would cooperate in every way in the seizure
of these arms and munition, They further indicated they had
received no instructions from their headquarters in Miami, advis-
ing them to conduct any investigation relative to planned anti-
