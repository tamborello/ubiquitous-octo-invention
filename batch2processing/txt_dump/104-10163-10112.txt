. CG» Identity B was very sympathetic and arranged to
have my suit for reinstatement take:. by Identity D which handled
most ODYOKE legal business locally. In 1951 Identity D referred
my case to a ZRMETAL law firm whose name I cannot recall exactly ~
but which initiated: legislative action for me, 1% travelled to
ZRMETAL once, to lobby on my own behalf, and-was able to speak
with Identity E who promised to make a favorable recommendation,
Travel costs and other problems’ prevented: my following up,
however, and nothing ever came of the bill as far as 1 know,

d. In 1959 Icentity D called me and told me that my
services would be needed again in view of the Communist tendencies
of the AMTHUG~1 regime, I agreed to cooperate without hesitation,
and was introduced to Identity F, KUBARK Chief of Station, who
assigned me to Identity G. Together we organized a group to
infiltrate the PBRUMEN government, I was evacuated to the JMWAVE
area with my family in the fall of 1960, and was met by Identity

» In the course of my relations with him and Identity I, I was
promised thet my citizenship status would be inquired into
officially, and that my service to KUBARK would resolve any doubts
that. might have existed in the case,

. e, In the summer of 1961, I decided in sheer desperation
to drive to ZRMETAL and to ask Identity. 1 for direct help in the
citizenship matter, My JMWAVE contacts, I explained, claimed that
‘there was no record of my quest for citizenship reinstatement. -
Identity I sent someone to take notes on my case, and also intro-

. duced me to Identity J as my next supervisor in the JMWAVE area,
Identity J later advised me that my file had been mislaid, Fut
that the case was being reactivated,

2. In March 1962, cover business provided an opportunity
for me to leave the. country long enough to re-enter with a. —

permanent residence visa, At that time 1 was told by the Immi-
gration officer (to my dismay) that my five-year waiting period for
‘citizenship would begin on the date of my re-entry, On another
eover trip in April 1963, I met Identity K who said that he could
not believe that my citizenship had not been reinstated by that

time, He said that he and Identity I had been given to understand
that it was all taken care of,

' @ %I wish to make the record clear that I have never .
applicd fer citizenship in any other country; that I did everything -
possible undex the above circumstances to maintain my PBPRIME :
‘citizenship; that I tried by every means available to have my
citizenship reinstated after I learned that it had heen taken from
me (without a hearing, by the way): and thet the PERUMEN passport
used in my evacuation was procured only after-assurances from
Identity ¥ that the action would not have an adverse effect upon
attempts <o reiastate ny citizenship. :

2. It would be apprectated if Headquarters could find some — |

way o2 expediting AHCLATTER-~1'’s case, Bringing this predicamont to

a satisfactory conulusion would relieve him of a personal dilemma
which might weigh heavily to the detriment of his operational :
effectiveness, Any questions or instructions on the matter up until

20 August should he referred to AMCLATYER~2 through ids tiadning

ease officer (note refersace and previous correspondence for train=-
ning site), :

REF: WAVE 9311, 14 July 1964

1. Prior to his current trip for training, AMCLATTER/1
requested permission to make a stopover in ZAMETAL on his return
to JMWAVE to inquire about the status of his citizenship, We
offered instead to have the matter looked into during his ‘train-
ing course and then, if there was anything his presence in
ZRMETAL could accomplish, to have arrangements made for appropriate
contacts, To this end he submitted a memorandum outlining his

recollection of the history of his case, It is paraphrased in
sterile form below,

a. In 1949-50, for approximately 16 month,, I worked

in Identity A, Before taking the appointment I consulted with
Identity B, who warned me that I wae endangering my citizenship,

but also promised to help in cass of trouble because I had offered
- te cooperate fully with ODEARL, It so happened that I quickly
Worked my way up to the rank of Sergeant and was detailed to liaison
, With ODYOKE agencies, This facilitated ny volunteering information
not normally given in liaison contacts, and even my fulfilling of -
requirements levied by them, particularly ODEARL and ODACID, :

b, I believe that it must have been Identity C who
made the charge that deprived me of ny citizenship on the techni~
cality that to have achieved my rank and position I must be
considered a PBRUMEN citizen, Identity C and I had crossed
swords over a fri--d of mine who had beer refused a PEPRIKE visa,

Later Identity C was fired for having beea involved in a visa
selling racket,
