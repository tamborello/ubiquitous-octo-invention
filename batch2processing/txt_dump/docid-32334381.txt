Bogalusa, J.ouisiana
September 1, 1965

Source advised he had recent conversation with
Tv, W. ARD who advised his nephew RICHARD ARD had attended a
meeting of the Pine Unit of the Original Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan (OKKKK) on the night of August 30, 1965. RICHARD.
ARD told T, W, ARD that only a few members were present for
a short meeting, in which was discussed ways to persuade
members to become more active. Source states he will attempt
to determine present active membership of the Pine Unit. He
states as of a few weeks ago, the-most active members of the
Pine Unit consisted of those mentioned below.

Source estimated that perhaps 90 per cent of the
people in the rural Washington Parish area are either Klansmen
or Klan sympathizers; however, the vast majority ceased being
active about the time the FBI came in force into the area,

He states the open active members of the Pine Unit are for
the most part the lower element who have little to loose by
peing Klansmen. He states TALMADGE JENKINS, investigator
for the Pine Unit, and CURT1S NOBLES are both known to him

as never trusting each other and in recent months friction
between them has increased. He states JENKINS some time

ago learned that NOBLES had told some lies about him and when
NOBLES was confronted by JENKINS, he admitted same and
apologized. Source stated NOBLES and JENKINS have never
trusted each other due to personal differences unknown to

source,

  
 
 
 
 
  
 

Source stated "BUTTERMILK" WILSON, who is very
aetive in one of the Bogalusa units of the OKKKK recently
told him that the Klan leaders in Bogalusa are responsible
for getting ROBERT DE PUGH to speak at the Bogalusa rally
on Labor Day, 1965, WILSON told source that the Bogalusa
leaders are expected to confer with DE PUGH for assistance
in the organization of a Minuteman unit for the Bogalusa
area. - .
