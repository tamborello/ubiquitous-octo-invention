Dear Mr. Elder ae

This is to ‘confirm our discussion of February 20
regarding the deposition of certain requests of the Select
Committee: . :

: @ With regard to the Comaittee* s letter of February 6,
and CIA's letter response 76-0200/1 of February 11, I asked
that a further attempt be made to identify the initials
"G.N.N.“. Those’ initials follow handwritten comments on a

_ March 1965.document in the AMLASH file which proposed giving

the Cuban government information which might compromise
AMLASH. . , oe,

(2) With regard to the Committee's letter of January
12, and CIA*s letter response 76-0062/1 of February 11, I
asked that CIA review its files.on Osvaldo Dorticos, Presi-
dent of Cuba, to determine if the message received by Dr.
Portell-Villa was placed in those files.

(3) Dan Dwyer and I reviewed the list of CTA person-
nel at the Mexico City station referenced in CIA's letter 76-
0083/3 of February 11 and agreed the list should remain at
- the Agency.

. {4) I requested the Select Committee be provided the
current address’ and telephone number of Mr.’ John Whiten, the
Desk Chief for Mexico in 1963.

“@) With regard to the Committee' s letter of January
29, xrequesting that two current Agency employees be made
available for interviews, we agreed the Agency should provide ;
the Committee-a letter: stating whether or not these ° yees
were readily available for interviews. WIS | |

Mr. Walter Elder

(&) Tan [wyer and I reviewed Agency originated
documezts in CIA's 201 File on Gilberto Policarpo Lopez.
It is cur «nderstanding you would reconsider CIA's decision to

deny. the Cecmittee's request for a copy of these documents.

.

i) With regard to the Committee's letter of January 30,

we agreed:

{2) We would for the time being narrow the request
in paregraph 1 to include only contacts of Director McCone;

“(b)- We would not alter the requests in paragraphs
2 and 3. - ‘

I trust this summary accords with your understanding of
our discussion,. but please let me know if there is any
misunderstending.

Sincerely,

ly oe

James H. Johnston
