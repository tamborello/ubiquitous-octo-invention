In his letter to the HSCA and in his oral testimony, Bagley
mentioned CIA's possession of a Secret KGB document concerning
disinformation. This document was received many years ago from
an East European intelligence officer defector. Therefore, we
cannot make a strong case for deleting reference to it, although
we wish that Bagley had not mentioned it.

I understand from your conversation with Rodger that-you would |
welcome a letter from the Agency, on this section of the report, |
for inclusion with it in the final report. Could we have more
details? ©

‘Very truly yours,

‘Ss. D. Breckinridge .
-Principal Coordinator, HSCA

THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505
Office of Legislative Counsel OLC 79-0113/n . -

Mr. G. Robert Blakey

Chief Counsel and Director

Select Committee on Assassinations
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Bob:
Herewith are comments on the Nosenko draft.

In commencing, it should be noted that Tennent Bagley remains
under cover, retired abroad. We are obliged to honor that cover,
which he has not moved to have modified. ‘To expose his true
status as a former CIA employee could have repercussions in his
present situation that we must accept as significant. When he
was here in November 1978, he was advised of steps necessary
to remove his cover, in the event he decided to go overt in this

- matter; he took no steps to alter his cover status. It remains
classified. We therefore request that the example set in the ee
Hart. testimony, of referring to Mr. Bagley by the title of Deputy
Chief, SB Division, be followed in this draft.

Following are detailed comments:
. NOSENKO
Testimony of Nosenko
Page g lines 15 and 18. KGB agents should read KGB officers.
Page g lines 3 through 20.

+» Suggest the following
rewrite: .
