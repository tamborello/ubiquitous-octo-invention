Re visit of Supervisor CHARLES K. CORBET, of the
Laboratory, to Phila. 4/5/65.

Phone company contact has furnished a tabulation of
resistances requested as follows:

Customer to MArket 7 exchange, 9th and Race Streets
204 ohms

 

MA 7 exchange to Federal Building, 9th and Market Streets
72 ohms

  

4th floor Main Frame, Federal Bullding, to Room 66 in
basement 25 ohms

   

Sincé.the last two figures would require pairs both! ¥
to and from these locations, these figures should be doubled.

Accordingly, the total resistance would be 204 plus 144, plus
50, equals 398 ohms.

    
      
    
   
  

Sufficient spare pairs are available between the
Federal Building and the MA 7 exchange so that extra pairs
could be used to halve that resistance.

 

Contact recalled telling SA CORBETT that customer was
in transmission zone 1. A check revealed customer is actually
in transmission zone 2. He noted, however, that this Pibden
