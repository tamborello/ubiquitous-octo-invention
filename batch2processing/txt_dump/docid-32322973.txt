; , - A review of Los Angeles indices reflects that

| informant was the subject of case entitled "JUSTO RAMON
LEON SANTOS, aka Jimmy De Leon, registered as Justo
Raymond Leon, SSN 40- ~29-487, SSA, 1948", Bufile |

: 25-322346, Les Angeles file 25-52101. Investigation

' in this case was initiated to determine if JUSTO RAMON

‘ LEON was identical with registrant JUSTO RAMON LEON
SANTOS. Investigation determined that he was and it.
was subsequently determined that LEON was in the Army |
and prosecution declined for this reason. In connection
therewith, LEON was contacted and at this time it was
determined that he was given a Medical Discharge for
hallucinations and mental problems. .

: Concerning the above, it is noted that in all
three contacts and interviews by Agents with LEON, he
has in no way manifested any mental or emotional problems.
His position as owner of two of the most elaborate
restaurants in the Los Angeles area would tend to bear
credence to this fact. Los Angeles will continually
remain alert for any signs of emotional instability. -
To date investigation has in no way reflected that this
informant has furnished any false information. :

Informant resides with his wife and children
; at 2548 Laurel Pass, Hollywood, California, telephone ;

i OL 6-7068. He owns and operates the Ia Scala Restaurant

and the Au Petit Jean Restaurant in Beverly Hills,

California.

| Police Department and Los Angeles Sheriff's Office were
i reviewed negatively by IC STEVEN T. SCHOENBAUM.

F -- On 1/25/62 a negative review was made of

the records of the Retail Merchants Credit Association,
Los Angeles, by IC TED W. CRAWFORD.
