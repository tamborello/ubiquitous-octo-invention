Chief Counsel and Director

Select Commuittee on Assassinations

Dear Mr. Blakey:

Along with other requests, your letter of
6 July 1978 seeks access to the Office of Personnel
files of certain employees. We have some reservations
about making available everything contained in these
employees' files.

First, there is a variety of personal information,
the revelation of which would intrude unnecessarily on
the employee's privacy. Further, an Agency officer's
file is more than just a compendium of his career; there
is much detail on assignments, including the countries
where he served, the cover used, a rather detailed de-
scription of duties, and information on a wide variety
of operations which are outside our understanding of |
the scope of your investigation. Perhaps it would be
possible for a member of my staff to discuss the specific
area(s) of HSCA interest with your representative. A
mutually agreeable solution should be available.

; Since your investigator/researchers have had the
opportunity to interview or depose employees of interest,
it would appear that the above course of action would
supplement whatever narrow areas the personal interview
left uncovered.

 

Sincerely,

S. D. Breckinridge
Principal Coordinator, HSCA

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations
: Deputy Director for Administration
Inspector General
. Special Assistant, Deputy Director
of Central Intelligence

FROM : S. D. Breckinridge

SUBJECT : Draft Letter to HSCA on Request for
0/Personnel File of Operations Officers

1. The attached draft letter is prepared as a
result of a decision of the DCI at the Morning Meeting
on Friday, 28 July, concerning general requests by the
HSCA for access to the Official Personnel Folders of
Agency employees. Some of the reasons advanced in the
letter for not providing blanket access refer to-classi-
fied considerations; however, these statements do not,
in themselves, seem classified. If you differ, the
letter can be assigned a classification.

2. Your comments would be appreciated. As this
issue dates back to 6 July, your prompt attention would.

be helpful.
