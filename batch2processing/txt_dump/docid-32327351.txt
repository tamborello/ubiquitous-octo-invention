ABICH of Elizabeth, New Jersey, is a refugee who works hard
for the overthrow of tho CASTRO Ragine. ABICK has collected
money for i though he is not a formal member of JURE or

DIEGO ABRANAM ABICH CHAVAN is believed icentical with
JOE (LNU).&

On 2/10/64 JORGINA ABICH (designated NK T-1 in enclosed

Btterhead Hemorandun) telephonically contacted the Newark
Gffice and advised that she is very concernei over the
activities of her brother DIEGO ABIC!H and - wished to furnish
information regarding his activitios, aL

On 2/12/64 JORGINA ABICE stated she is very concerned.
over the activities of her brother because their parents reside |
in Santiago de Cuba and-are nlanning an imminent trip to Spain as/
refugees and already have their tickets. Eis actions she is /
afraid, will jeopardise their parents position in Cuba. %

She also stated that she is concerned that DIEGO
might find out that she has furnished information concerning
his activities, Also her sister has recently called CISNEROS.
about their parents* problens and her concern about DIZGO's
activities, ¥%&

She also requested that in any intervicw of mombers
of JURE in cliami that her brother's name not be mentioned as
he would eventually find out about it and would suspect that
she furnished the infcrmation or else JURE officials would
Suspect he was an informant.&

Referenced iHami report reveals that in Decenber of
1963 KAY was interested in obtaining 500 to 1,000 pounds of
C-4 explosives and had funds available for the purchase. &

_ Fron dnformatioa available it appears probable that
JURZ has plans for aa itizinent. raid on Cuba and that ADICH
had attempted to secure arus and explosives for JURE although
he appears to have abandoned this attempt stating they had
made other arrangements, 1
