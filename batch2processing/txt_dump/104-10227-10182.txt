Payments to Dependents of "Heroes and Martyra”

ACHON FEUD - EE POHEIELD

See Paragraph 3
DIR 06846

an 1. Forwarded under separate cover {6 a listing of all payments
presently being made by AMIRON to dependents of heroes and martyrs. In addition
* to the AMIRON payments JMWAVE to directly paying the widow of AMCLAD-1 (sea °
reference) and $30 per month to the widow of AMCUSP-L.

2. It 18 considered most inadvisable to torminate benefits to these
dependents aspecially so long as subsistence payments are ‘continued to dependents
of captured, missing and deceased strike force personnel. If these faw payments
were discontinued while the large group remained in a "pay" status the local

_ Yepercussions would-be loud and most embarrassing.

. 3. In any event it is difficult to arrive at a doller figure that
would constitute an cquitable lump-sum cettlement in such cases, ° Instead it
1a suggested that these payments be continued until such time as a decision is
reached on dependenta of deceased strike force personnel and final -acttlements
be patterned after those decided on- for the strike force group.
