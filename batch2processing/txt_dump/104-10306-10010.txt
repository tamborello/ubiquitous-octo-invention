Otherwise the operation was approved.

Alexis Johnson and Mr. Bundy raised: questions of the conse quences
of finding an arms cache or knocking over an infiltration at the time of the
OAS debate on the Venezuelan problem. Arguments were persuasive that _
we should go slowly during this period. I read from the February 25th
Cuban checklist of the deterioration of the spirit of the people of Cuba,. the
feeling that we were about to recognize the Castro government. and the apathy
toward further resistance as evidence of the price we are paying for
slow-downs and deferments of action against Cuba. I said that I thought our
Cuban program was incomplete disarray. We had no policy or covert
operations. We now are hesitating on infiltration and exfiltration, our
economic denial program was failing, while Castro is making significant

1. Erne question of #) the ‘extent of the SAC planes operations in South
Vietnam was discussed against the background of Dr. McMillan's

: With respect to “4,, instructions were to be given that the primary

' purpose of the flights was to survey border activity and the 30 mile shot

‘| McMillan's proposal that if the SAC planes were to go as far north as the
2ist parallel, then they should go all the way to the China border and the
proposed CIA operation out of Takhli should be abandoned. This raised the
question of whether civilian or military planes and pilots should be over
North Vietnam to the extent which could not be explained as being "off |
course"
limited as outlined above or should cover the entire country.
decided to refer the matter to higher authority for decision.
no objection to SAC's overflight of North Vietnam but merely took the
position that if they went as far north as proposed by McMillan, they i

should cover the entire country. oat

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Special Group Meeting (5412) - 2 April 1964

l. Briefly reviewed the status of North Viet Nam operations 34A,
All concluded that the results have been negative and disappointing.
I took the position this was to be expected but that now the period of
organization had past, we 2 might. get some better_r results. eee

 

The CLA IDEA LIST- cra thce program was s approved except ;
for the North Korean flight. Defense interposed an objection to this . ;
flight on the grounds that they were nearing agreement for the release
of helicopter crews which have been held in North Korean custody.

ACTION: This particular flight should be withheld. USIB i
and most particularly DIA should be informed in the meeting

and the Swedish captains. This was recognizedas a must. It was agreed

I pointed out that copies of the Memorandum had been sent
to the Attorney General and the Department of Justice but there had been
no conversation on the subject.

ACTION: Discuss with General Carter and Mr. Helms
steps we should take to establish the
credibility of the report; also communicate
with the FBI through Mr. Papich. Also l
should call the Attorney General personally.

4. Prior to the meeting Mr. Vance asked my opinion of using
the 22 million psyops leaflets which inadvertently had been printed on
U.S. manufactured. white sulphite paper, all as reported in MACV
cable MAC SOG 5050-dated 18 June 1964 (IN 09143). I told Vance that I felt
we should go ahead. It was too bad it had been done this way, but it is one of
‘those things that. a person not thoroughly acquainted with this type of operation

might overlook. He was in agreement and presumably will instruct the release
of the leaflets. : .

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

‘SUBJECT: 303 Committee Meeting - 18 June 1964

1.” Item I: Autonomous Operations.

This was raised in view of Manuel Ray's request for
- $25, 000 and indications that he is attempting to make a new expedition to
Cuba in a chartered ship. Various courses of possible action with Ray
were discussed, ranging from cutting him off altogether to giving him
the money. It developed that Ray is acting inconsistently with the agreement
with him which was that he would operate outside the United States. Therefore
it was decided that we would tell him that he must abide by the agreement,
that he must find.a base of operations outside the United.States and if he does
we will endeavor to secure the release of his ship which is now in Puerto Rico,
and that we will give him financial support.

we 2. With respect to Artime on was pointed out that Artime's

operations are very costly. CIA has pol ft this operation
this year - the future bill will be large, bUt not as great. FitzGerald
reported that Artime planned one hit and run.operation a month, but he noted
he would be lucky if he could pull off one every 3 months. Bundy seemed to
feel Artime was more of a threat than an operator and should be maintained
for that purpose and operations discouraged. FitzGerald pointed out this is
not practical, It was agreed to proceed with Artime recognizing that U.S.
or CIA support of him would probably be "blown''. Furthermore it was.
suggested that he be cautioned to be careful and not follow unduly reckless
courses of action.

 

3. There was a long discussion on the implications of the CIA
Junel0th memorandum reporting plans of Cuban exiles to assassinate leading
Cuban government leaders. This report was taken most seriously by the group.
It was felt that the purpose of advising us through CIA of these plans was to
put us on notice and therefore we-should not fail to take appropriate precautionary
actions to see that no assassination attempt of which we had knowledge was
carried out. It was decided that appropriate authorities, i.e. Department of
Justice and the FBI, . should be notified and urged to take appropriate action
against the individuals. involved. .

I took the position that we are overly exercised, that I was
inclined to write the whole thing off as Miami cocktail party talk rather than
definite plans. Had I seen the Memo before it was distributed, I would have
investigated the sources and the credibility of the whole thing before taking
action. However the group were more concerned than I and therefore planning to
discuss the subject with the Attorney General and possibly Mr. Hoover.
