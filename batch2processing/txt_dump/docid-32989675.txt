*’ The Bureau has been advised of all the above

co Bureau authority is requested to continue
investigation of the NGP.

: Bureau's attention is invited to the fact that
KARL HAND has placed major emphasis on the recruiting of
high school students, age 14 to 17, for the White Youth
Alliance.

. In view of the above, Buffalo will not conduct
active investigation on individuals falling within the ages
of 14 to 17 without Bureau approval.

Although KARL HAND makes claims to a large
following, investigation has indicated that his claims
are greatly exaggerated and essentially without substance.
