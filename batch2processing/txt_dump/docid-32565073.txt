PH T-7 on January 16, 1964, advised that a party
for about 16 people was held by VITO SANTORO at his new
restaurant, Casa Mia La Fontana, at which RUSSELL BUFALINO
served as the cook.

PH T-15 on January 21, 1964, said that the subject,
RUSSELL BUFALINO, was described as being the "head boss out
there", This referred, according to the informant, to the
Pittston - Wilkes-Barre, Pa., area. This information was
heard by the informant. The informant said that the only one
in Philadelphia who was on the "commission" was ANGELO BRUNO.
T-15 stated that in referring to the connections of BUFALINO
and BRUNO he meant their connections with Cosa Nostra.

Previous reports set forth information concerning a
telephone call made from the Hotel Forrest and charged to rooms
occupied. by the subject and members of his party during 1963.
One of the numbers called was 45037 at Guadalajara, Mexico.

On January 13, 1964, Captain LUIS DE LA BARREDA,
Federal Security Police, Mexico City, advised that telephone
number 45037 at Guadalajara,Mexico, according to information
received from Guadalajara, is listed to JORGE CONTRERAS BOBADILLA,
residence Calle 42 #242, Sector Hidalgo.

The Guadalajara Telephone Directory dated February
1963 lists this individual as Cap. JORGE CONTRERAS BOBADILLA,
with the same address as mentioned previously. It should. be
noted that the abbreviation "Cap." refers to his title as a
Captain (probably in some branch of the Mexican armed forces)

Previous report reflected that in about January 1964
the subject and ANGELO SON had contacted the operator of a
bowling alley and had considered loaning him some money to
settle with part or all of his debts.

PH.T-5 on January 31, 1964, advised that the bowling
alley operator referred to above was ROBERT HAYWARD who operates
Umpire Lanes-at Carbondale, Pa. HAYWARD lived in Philadelphia
for several years and presently owns a loan company there. In
addition to Umpire Lanes, he also has invested heavily ‘in the
local-airport at Forty Fort, Pa. For years HAYWARD has been .
a friend of NICK PERUGINO who operates PERUGINO's Bar at Kingston,
Pa. The Umpire Lanes are doing well and HAYWARD intended to expand

Administrative Data

Investigative period of this report predates referenced
report because results of investigation conducted prior to the
submission of referenced report were not received until after the
report was submitted.

The following information is being set forth under the
administrative section because of the fact that it cannot be
properly evaluated at this time and possibly when further investi-
gation is made, some significance may be attached to this infor-
mation. :

ANTHONY DE STEFANO had met with STEVE MAGADDINO, VINCENT SCRO,
and CHARLES. MONTANA in Buffalo, N.Y.: During this meeting, JOSEPH
FALCONE began to explain to MAGADDINO why he had- gone. to. New York
City to see MAGADDINO.

“A young man came to Utica from Long Island to see me.

He mentioned MAGLIOCCO to me. sesvvecccccecsccssecvee
2c0000000000000CARMINE. I have never met this CARMINE

but once and hardly knew him. He mentioned MAGLIOCCO

to me (CARMINE may possibly be CARMINE PERSICO, Jr.).

So ROSARIO MANCUSO, that is ROSARIO BUFFALINO, told me
that these fellows were in a tight spot™ and maybe I

could help. .-Now I happen to be in New York on the CAPUTO
matter, you know, when this CARMINE and three others

came to see me with the head lieutenant".

of RUSS BUFALINO was mentioned in connection with this deal.
However, due to the low tone of the conversation, it was not
clear just what connection BUFALINO had with the deal.

The deal apparently centered around the town of Hegins,
Pa.

Investigation to date has not definitely identified
MIKE LERUE (ph). .

Chief of Police LYLE CLARK on 1/28/64 advised SA WALKER
WHITE, Jr., that located in Hegins, Pa., is the Twin Valley
Farmer's Exchange, one of the largest shippers of eggs in Pennsyl-
vania.. This is operated by WALTER and LEON ESHELMAN, father and
son who are believed to be completely reliable and reputable
businessmen. This company ships most. of the eggs to the New York
City area-and has several trucks leaving for that area every night.
One of the drivers who has the New York City route is: FRANK. ZONO
who makes about $80.00 a week. ZONO has recently been observed
driving a 1963 or 1964 Cadillac which he apparently owns.

Several days prior to 1/28/64, Chief CLARK received an
anonymous telephone call advising him to write down what was
being -said since he could not repeat-it and would have to talk
fast. The caller advised that the Twin Valley Farmer's Exchange
trucks going to New York City were carrying bootleg whiskey with
the eggs packed in the same type egg cartons. The caller hung
up before Chief CLARK could ask any questions.

PH 665-C-TE-has advised that recently the subject-has
been trying to persuade JANE COLLINS to lie concerning his
association. with her if she is called as a witness before: the
INS hearing presently being conducted at Philadelphia, Pa.

JOSEPH VALACHI, who is presently incarcerated in a
Washington, D.C., jail,was interviewed on 2/3/64 by SA JOHN M.
FLATLEY. -VALACHI advised he knows several BUFALINOs and: would
like to see a photograph of RUSSELL BUFALINO in discussing his
knowledge of -him and his background. He feels he remembers: meeting
BUFALINO many years ago or that he was told.by another "member"
that BUFALINO was a "member". He said that if this latter method
was the way he learned of BUFALINO's affiliation with .Cose Nostra,
"It is good enough for me. I would take an oath that he was a
‘member' if another 'member' told me so". VALACHI said consequently

he could know that BUFALINO was a "member" and know nothing
else concerning his background. Photographs of the subject
will be sent to WFO under separate cover for display to VALACHI
concerning his knowledge of the subject; however, it appears
from the above that it is unlikely that he has any personal
knowledge of the subject's affiliation with the Cosa Nostra.

PCI GEORGE KRAUCHEUNAS on 4/6/64 advised SA JOHN W.
REINHARD that he had no knowledge of any JACK COULTER, "LEFTY",
or "LITTLE HARRY" in the Scranton area.

PH 559=C on 4/6/64 advised SA JOHN W. REINHARD that
he did not know any JACK COULTER or individuals using the names
"LEFTY" or "LITTLE HARRY" who are involved in the rackets or
the dress business in the Scranton area.

PH 521-C on 3/13/64 and 3/27/64 reported no necitient
information concerning the subject.

The Newark Office by letter. of 2/25/64 reported that
efforts were unsuccessful in locating E. DRISCOLL, 158 DeHeart
Street, and CARMELLA THERESA NAVARRO, 81 Grove Street, both .
Elizabeth, N.J., for interview.

The 1963 Elizabeth, N.J., City Directory reflects
GASPER R. (VIRGINIA) NAVARRO residesat 81 Grove Street, Elizabeth,
N.J. GASPER R. NAVARRO is | veportedly employed as a pipe fitter
in Rahway, N.J.

; Elizabeth City Directory reflects EDWARD V. DRISCOLL

Avenue, Elizabeth, N.J. The City Directory dated 1963 reflected
the telephone number of E, DRISCOLL as 3547239.

The telephone number set forth above is the same as
the telephone number which was called from a room occupied by
the subject at Hotel Forrest, New York City, between 8/13/63 and
8/23/63.

Corporal ROY PETERS, Pennsylvania State Police, "ening.

Pasy on 3/16/64 and 4/6/64 advised that he could furnish no
