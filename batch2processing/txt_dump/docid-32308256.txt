MM 105-1598

U. S. Border Patrol and U. S. Customs immediately
instituted physical surveillances at Polk City and North
Perry Airports.

, Miami Office immediately contacted MM 639-S,

‘ who is in touch with STURGIS, and MM 635-S, who is in
contact with DIAZ LANZ. Both informants advised infor-
mation received by Border Patrol highly unlikely in that
STURGIS and LANZ at the present time have no such plans 7

on 7/28/63, Border Patrol stated nothing had
_ developed, apparently the information was false, no
Bellanca airplane ever appeared or was identified, this
might have been a publicity stunt by STURGIS and the
surveillance would be discontinued at midnight.

t On 7/29/63, Border Patrol advised that as of
12:01 AM the surveillance was discontinued, the infor- ;
: mation was obviously false and they were taking no :

i further action in this matter. ,

: The above information is not being set forth '
in form suitable for dissemination inasmuch as it appears |
that Border Patrol had received false information, Miami

' Office did not participate and Miami informants immediately

i advised that the allegation was highly unlikely and no

: : such plans existed. -
