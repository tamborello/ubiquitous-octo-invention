He is searching for anyone who has seen the draft report or anyone | -
who ‘knows what names were deleted. He is offering $25,000 for each. |

geta statue’ erected: in Havana.-He hinted he has ‘tentatively identified’ **
ten unpublished names and only needs ten more. ‘This information has
_been passed to the FBI. : Cob oe Tea)
