Kh) On 1/17/83, source was queried concerning any
knowledge he might have of the NOSENKO matter. He advised
that "officially" the KGB never discusses defectors and
generally all one would hear would be rumor and gossip.
NOSENKO is considered a "tyrajtor" in the eyes of the KGB
as far as-source is aware (XV a1)

. The source assumed that NOSENKO told western
intelligence everything concerning Second Chief Directorate
(SCD) activities in Moscow and further assumes that, as is
custom, a "special Commission" of the SCD was convened

fis an act NOSENKO's defection to do a damage assessment.
A

  

  

 

    

S an aside, source noted that {his defection would be
examined" by members of the K Directorate of the First
Chief Directorgte and by members of the 9th Department of the
S Directorate fs) .

Source has no knowledge concerning any connection a
between the NOSENKO defection in 1964 and LEE HARVEY OSWALD's
, assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963. Asked
to. give his opinion on the merits of some speculation that
' NOSENKO defected under: the direction of the KGB to convince
the US that the KGB had nothing to do with OSWALD's actions,
‘ source did not believe that to be the case. In source's
\ opinion, NOSENKO's defection and all the information he furnished
\ about the SCD wo have been too great a price to pay "to
‘save one man. "(eVee)

Source does not believe thatf{the KGB would risk
"blowing an illegal" by tasking the illégal te, attempt to
locate a defector such as NOSENKO in the wes] Likewise,
source has never heard that the KGB killed or attempted to kill
a defector. Such actions, if they ever occurred, certajnly
ended{after OLEG LYALIN's:.defection in England in 1971%6)

COMMENT: ;

In 1969, [the ATLAST illegal]was, in fact, ordered

by the KGB to attempt to verify NOSENKO's pr gence ata
