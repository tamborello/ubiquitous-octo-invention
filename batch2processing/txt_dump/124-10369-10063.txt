Anonymous Telephone Message

G)
1. ‘he following{eable from the CIA Station in Londof]vas reported
orally to Mr, Samuel Papich at 0980 on 23 November:

@. ‘the British Security Service (MI-5) has reported that at
1805 GMT on 22 Nevember an anonymous telephone call was made in
Cambridge, England, to the senior reporter of the Cambridge News. The
caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the
Ameriean Embassy in London for some big news and then hung up.

3. After the word of the President's death was received the re-
porter informed the Cambridge police of the anonymous dall and the
police informed MI-5. The important point is that the cali was made,
according to MI-5 calculations, about 25 minutes before the President
was shot. The Cambridge reporter had never received a call of this
kind before and Mi-5 state that he is knéwn to them as a sound and loyal
person with no security record.

h, MI-5 noted that similar anonymous phone calls of a strangely
coincidental nature have been received by pérsons in the U. K. over the
past year, particularly in connection with the case of Dr. Ward.

5. The British Security Serviee stated its desire to assist in

every possible way on any follow-up investigations required within
the United Kingdom.
