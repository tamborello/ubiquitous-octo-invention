Laundry, Drycleaning and Dye House Workers International Union,
Local 218, Atlantay.Georgia (159-2651), related several incidents which
had happened recently. He believed the purpose of these incidents
was to scare him into allowing hoodlums into his union in Miami and
felt it was an attempt by "the Mafia" or a big-shot hoodlum, David
Yaras in Miami, to get a man into his union as a business agent in
that area. Bennie Husick, "leg man" for Yaras, had-called Abercrombie
and asked for a job with his union as a business agent. When
Abercrombie told Husick he could not have the job because of his
police record, Husick told Abercrombie he hoped that he (Abercrombie )
was never in Miami when Yaras was in town. After this conversation
Abercrombie received several messages to call David and he assumed
they might have been from Yaras. He did not ever try to contact
Yaras.
