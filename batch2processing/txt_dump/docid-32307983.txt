IV, CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

; Plot to "Hit" FRANK PETER BALISTRIERI

‘During the past year, MI T-1 has reported a number of
clandestine type meetings attended by SANTO MARINO, VITO AIELLO,
| JOHN AIELLO, and the informant, all of whom are d1d-timers
in the Milwaukee LCN family, who are extremely unhappy with the
one=j=man dictatorial rule of this family by the boss, FRANK PETER
4°, BALISTRIERI. According to MI T-1, MARINO and the AIELLOs were
“. talking seriously of a "hit" on BALISTRIERI to get him out: of
the way and -have a turno (meeting) of the family membership
to select a new boss. Those three members were urging infor-
mant to do the job on BALISTRIERI which informant declined to
have any part of and suggested that BALISTRIERI might go to
prison when sentenced (9/18/67) on his Federal income tax
conviction (BALISTRIERI was convicted 3/23/67, in USDC, SDI,
at Springfield, Illinois).

 

In most recent discussions, MARINO, the AIJELLOs, and
several other disgruntled Milwaukee LCN members have been
talking in terms OF ap teleee the Milwaukee family members
to vote on ousting RI from his position as boss
- rather than resort to violence to get BALISTRIERI out of the: ‘WAY «.

: ‘Regarding MI T=-1's previously reported information

of 5/4/65, that AUGUST CHIAVEROTTI and WALTER "BLACKIE" ,.BROCCA,
Milwaukee hoodlums but not LCN members, had incurred the wrath
of FRANK PETER BALISTRIERI over business and financial matters
to the extent they feared for their lives, informant noted in
the past year that CHIAVEROTTI and BROCCA returned to Milwaukee
from the West Coast where they took refuge and obtained jobs,
Informant said that since returning to Milwaukee, they have

been seen with BALISTRIERI and apparently are no longer in BALI-
STRIERI's disfavor. :

SECURITY OF INFORMANTS

; ‘New York airtel to the Bureau and auxiliary offices, dated
5/16/66, set out certain suggestions regarding uniform reporting in
the Membership Section’ of reports prepared by auxiliary offices,

To the extent possible, New York's recommendations have been
followed with certain exceptions, as explained below:

Milwaukee's report is set out alphabetically as ‘to
membérs within the breakdowns of the several LCN families identi-
' fied. This is done to avoid repetition after each member's name
‘is listed. Likewise, the best source is set out at the beginning
of the listing of members by families,

T symbols, rather than informant symbol numbers
have been used in referring to the best source of membership,
In this regard Milwaukee's best source of all memberships is
MI 623-C-TE, who has been given T-1 and T-2 symbols to further
protect his identity in the listings of members, %should also
be noted that this informant is probably the best source of the
Rockford, Illinois LCN family membership and in some instances
may be the best source of some Chicago, Illinois family members.
If MI 623-C-TE were.to be identified as such in both Milwaukee
and Chicago Division reports, this informant would be exposed to
compromise and jeopardy of his personal safety, especially in
view of his close ties with members of the Rockford family and
his LCN membership and identity with the Milwaukee family. To
futher protect MI 623-C-TE, his identity under T symbols in
the details will not show that he is a member of the Milwaukee
family in view of possible dissemination of this report...

i ‘The initial period of instant report predates referenced
Milwaukee report, since some informant information received prior
to the date of referenced report was not available when that
report was prepared,

INFORMATION EXCLUDED FROM DETAILS OF REPORT

The following information is being set out’ in the

Administrative Pages of instant. report to insure that the
identity of MI 623-C-TE (MI T-1 and MI T-2) is not compromised,
To report this information in the details along with the possi-
bility of dissemination of this report could logically compromise .
this informant, Accordingly this information is of necessity.
confined to the Administrative Pages. This information is broken
down into Sections>:to ‘correspond ‘with the: manner: iti would other .
wise be set out in the details. :
