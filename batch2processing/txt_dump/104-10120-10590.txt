combining the FBI with Santa Claus with the British East India Company
with Barnum & Bailey and the Ringling Bros. Circus. And before we
get lost in the derision that this implies, let's take pause on two
very positive possibilities. One, that this may not be such a bad
idea at that. It may take its form among the great diversions."

WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT - #52hl2h (De BAGGIO, Thomas)

Thomas De BAGGIO, editor of the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT, a newspaper
described as part of the Underground Press Syndicate, was brought to your
attention in May 1967 a 27) employee, who resides in
the same apartment house as BAGGIO and who was concerned about
meeting De BAGGIO because of the nature of the paper published by De
BAGGIO. OS conducted inquiries on De BAGGIO and furnished the results to
Mr. GOODWIN's office who had had a request from De BAGGIO to verify
GOLENIEWSKI's CIA employment. At the time De BAGGIO called GOODWIN's
office he mentioned he knew Herman KIMSEY but had not seen him recently.
GOODWIN's office gave De BAGGIO a “No comment" reply. Of interest is
Mr. SAYLE's’ memo for the record dtd 6 June 1967 in which he speculates

. that Capital Hill editor for the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT, Charles BOISE,

may be identical to Carl BLOISE, new Washington correspondent for
the PEOPLE's WORLD and reputed stringer for SUNDAY RAMPARTS.

Also, of note is the fact that De BAGGIO appeared on the same
Barry FARBER show as noted above for Guy RICHARDS.

SPECTRUM

OS indices are negative on SPECTRUM. (NOTE: Speculation would be
that SPECTRUM may be a new name for the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT. This

could be verified.)

WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT - fsehhok (RICHARDS , Guy)

Reference file contains a transcript of the Barry FARBER Show over
Station WOR-AM, New York, on 3 May 1967 entitled "Journalists Discuss

of the Agency. Quote RICHARDS: “Now, let's take a look, for example,
