Re report of SA HAROLD J, EDGERTON dated 4/30/68 at ,

Dallas, Texas. ,
For the intornathoh a the-Bureau, Dallas is probing ©

., the activities of the subject with-two specific objectives.
ph One, he is a bookmaker as will bé& readily observed in referenced
y); report; two, in this connection he is believéd to be tied in
jor with PHILIP STEPHENAB0SCO,/,DL 92-331, LCN suspect and known
* -° elose associate of “JOSEPH“FRANCIS#€IVELLO, LCN. Not too much
is known about subject's earliér-years—in~Dallas, and this is
being developed, but it has been established that he has been
bookmaking for some time-and according to DL 369-C, who at one
time was subject's collector, subject has "fattened" himself
on his bookmaking activities, This, together with his verified
contacts with BOSCO, raise a logical question as to whether he’
is part of the CIVELLO group. His birth ‘has not been verified,
and through INS this will be verified.

' Dallas is asking the Bureau to approve a review of lc
- telephone records for toll calls on all telephones available

to subject not only to assist in identifying his contacts, but

also whether his bookmaking activities reach outside of Texas.

At this time, such review would be strictly of investigative
interest in our efforts to pin down the two aspects mentioned
above. Review of such records will be ‘handled through JAMES

M, VAUGHAN, JR., Area Security Manager, Southwestern Bell
Telephone Company, SAC contact and former SA, with full security
