-modernization trom MAAG Military Grant Assistance since the Trujillo era ended in
‘1961. - This assistance precluded small arms since the Dominican inventory was loaded
‘with their own Cristobal carbines, Spanish CETME!s, German G-3's, Mauser Rifles and
“Carbines, and FAL 7.62 (NATO) Rifles. Prior, during, and following the Revolution
_of 1965 many of the Government's small arms and munitions were stolen or diverted
to revolutionaries and’ have been used since for terrorist-purposes, mostly in Santo
Domingo. The Arms Manufacturing Plant at San Cristobal and the Chemical and
Explosives Plant at Villa Mella have been on a caretaker basis since the early

of money, new machinery and foreign expertise. Following ‘President BALAGUER's
election in 1966 and his austerity program, the military: was. forced to draw in thei

arrangement with}Interarmco, Alexandria, Virginia. However no major arms pur-
chases have been made since the '65 Revolution, although several unsuccessful .

| attempts were made by U.S, and other Arms dealers periodically to sell various

| weapons systems, ie., FAL, Stoner, AR18's, etc. Each time the actual arms bids

i were boosted 10% by whoever was promoting the "deal"; in the old Trujillo manner. °:

2. (c) Speculators °

i a. Mr. Sam Cummins, President of Interarmco, Monaco, made his start following

still remember both with affection and greed. Much of the Army is still equipped .
with this Interarmco surplus (tanks, armored cars, artillery, machine guns, mortars
H etc.). His agent still has 1st chance at any bartering and selling.

b. Mr. Irving Davidson, Washington, D.C., is another power in Dominican selling
! circles and much quoted on any type speculation.. He is considered. the top contact:
in the U.S. by Dominican dealers. oF ;

speculation (AR 18 sales). The Peguero's (father-and 2 brothers) are well connected
politically, financially, and socially in the DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. oo ;
