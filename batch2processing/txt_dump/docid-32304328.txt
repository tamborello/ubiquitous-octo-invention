"End This Confusion"

_

v\ . The editor of the "Herald Express" today demands
PT\ that the law governing wiretapping must be amended... "to
‘ protect the rights of law-abiding citizens; and amended in
such clear language that the shield of ‘elvil rights!
en cannot be employed by hoodluns, murderers, kidnapers."

He points out that evidence obtained by wire-
a tapping cannot be used in federal cases, and other courts,
_-- state and federal, have held that this prohibition extends
— to states in which the iaws permit the use of wiretapping
for gathering evidence in criminal cases,

"Without legal wiretapping, law enforcement
agencies would be powerless to deal with many kinds of
criminal activities, and the imposition of the federal
stricture upon the states would, in the opinion of police
and prosecutors, result in a ‘gigantic legal jailbreak.1'"

The decision of a U.S. Appeals Court that federal
courts should not interfere with state prosecutions in
which state-approved wiretap information is used as evidence,
is acclaimed by the "Herald Express" editor because it
"“peturned the element of common sense to the law." However,
he does not feel that this ruling is enough. He thinks the ,
Federal Communications Act, Section 605, needs to be spelled ‘
out "so that even judges and justices can understand it.

"It was never meant to protect the eriminal,
but has been so conatrued in hair-splitting decisions."

KENNY DUNCAN's
Swing Parties

KENNY. DUNCAN has such uncanny ability with guns
that for several" years he has performed the trick shooting
for actor Gq UTRY. Such ability naturally begets a

a of partners - KENNY DUNCAN has at least so far been immine
to interference by Hollywood vice officers. According to
LA 4062-C who has been DUNCAN's guest on more than one
occasion, the parties in DUNCAN's apartment have never been
interrupted by the law.
