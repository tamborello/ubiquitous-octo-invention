PARFET that JACK MORAN, a former sergeant in RICHARD CAIN's
investigative unit with Cook County Sheriff's Police was
vitally afraid of being questioned regarding his association

On 1/15 and 24/68, CG 6775-C furnished the following
information to SA JOSEPH B. GRAFF:

In about 1951 Captain JOHN SCHERPING (deceased),

SCHERPING confided to Informant that he was certain that CAIN
had stolen this money. Informant knew he had not stolen the
money, and he regarded SCHERPING as completely trustworthy.
At the time the partnership was dissolved, SCHERPING told
Informant that he did not want CAIN retained in any way in
this firm...

With regard to CAIN's true name, Informant was
told by CAIN that his ancestry was not Italian, and that his
mother was married to an Italian, but he was born after she
had remarried, and his father's name is CAIN. He indicated
that authorities could never locate a birth certificate
reflecting that his father was Italian.

In about October or early November, 1967, CAIN called.

Informant, and after a couple. of minutes of small talk,
CAIN asked Informant if he would do some work for him, CAIN,
and it was apparent that this work would involve bugging a
telephone, and Informant then told CAIN that he would not
do it. CAIN never mentioned the name of any party.

On 1/19/68, ART PETACQUE made available a copy of

a letter received by the "Chicago Sun-Times" written over
the signature of RICHARD CAIN. :
