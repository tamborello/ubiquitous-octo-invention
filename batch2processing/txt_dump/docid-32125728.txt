RE: UNKNOWN SUBJECTS; BOMBING OF
SIXTEENTH STREET BAPTIST CHURCH

 

 

: As. a result of conferences of Agents working on the
bombing cases in Birmingham, it was agreed that the following
remain as prime suspects: ‘Thomas Blanton, Jr., Charles Cagle,
Robert Chambliss, Troy Ingram, Levi Yarborough, Secondary

NSRP members. Coleman implied he has a connection with the
Governor's office and said "we" intend to "pull the rug out from
