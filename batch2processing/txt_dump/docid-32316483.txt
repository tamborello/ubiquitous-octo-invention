ADMINISTRATIVE : (CONT'D)

It will be noted that NY 4318-C, who is NY T-1
in the details of this report, is a close friend of FRANK
CONNOLLY, former official of Local 707 and mentioned also
in the details of this report.

NY 4318-C is endeavoring to persuade CONNOLLY to
cooperate with the FBI in bringing to light shakedowns and
other matters relative to Local 707.

In a meeting between the informant and CONNOLLY
during July, 1964, CONNOLLY indicated a desire to cooperate
with the FBI, but several confusing issues concerning control
of the union have arisen and he (CONNOLLY) did not desire to
talk to anyone just yet.

This matter is being followed closely with the
informant so that CONNOLLY will be interviewed at the most
advantageous time in an attempt to obtain his fullest
cooperation.
