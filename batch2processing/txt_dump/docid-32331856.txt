load: himself but did not have enough money to swing the

deal, and encouraged ZERVOS to put up half the money so
oe they could buy the load together.

ZERVOS refused because he had only been recently released.
from the Western State Penitentiary after serving 224
years after conviction for murder and suggested to ABRAHAM
that they take,the cigarettes to GABRIEL MANNARINO :
(Pittsburgh top noodium) who owned the S&S Distributing
Co., a cigarette vending machine concern.

In the preserice of ZERVOS, ABRAHAM told the Syrian man and
MAINER that if ZERVOS would not. put up any money he was
not in a position to take the load himself but offered to
take them to MANNARINO in his own car. ABRAHAM left with
the *two individuals and looked up GABRIEL MANNARINO who

i presumably bought the entire stolen shipment.

ZERVOS noticed the Syrian man in New Kensington,a number

wagon,not further described, and assumes that he regularly
supplied the S&S Distributing Company with stolen
cigarettes for at least three or fourimonths sinee during
; his first meeting with the group, the Syrian man offered

i to supply cigarettes regularly. /

for the past year and one-half but observed MAINER several
bo ‘times after their initial meeting in the lobby of the Ken
Mar Hotel and also in the Laetus Club.

ZERV OS also speculated that MAINER and his companion could

YSLONDANO, ake, “RED " operator of the Bachelor's club in
“New Kensington, ‘and a long-time fence. (Cleveland note

| ag GLORDANO is a suspect in this case in connection with his
| Te purchases of burlap bags).

ZERVOS is of the opinion that MAINER's connections in
New Kensington would be with members of the MANNARINO

PG 52-1687

ZERVOS is extremely reluctant to make any open inquiries
concerning MAINER in New Kensington and considers it
highly inadvisable for him to do so at the risk of
disclosure as a source of information. ;

ZERVOS examined photographs of GEORGE VICTOR ZUGRAVE,
FBI #2878523, SAMUEL JOSEPH MESSARIS; FBI. #840808, and
FLOREA, but was unable to recognize them.

Photographs of the above were also displayed to PG~545-C
on 1/6/59 by SA RICHARD GORDON DOUCE without making an
identification. Co .

In light of the position of the S& Distributing Company's
obvious involvement in fis case, the foregoing information
furnished by ZERVOS could have a very definite bearing on

‘the solution of this case. Tt seems reasonable to assume that

FLOREA; MAINER and their confederates would be logical
candidates. for the burglary of the armory in Canton, ;
especially in view of the alleged dealing in stolen cigarettes,
as outlined above, it would place MAINER in contact with
MANNARINO and the S&S Distributing Company. ;

Files of the Pittsburgh office indicate that MAINER and
FLOYD D. VINCENTI, FBI #843750C were reportedly. overheard
planning a.bank, robbery..in Gary, Indiana, presumably during
11/58. In addition, MAINER is under investigation by the
Cleveland Office in a TFIS matter involving the theft of
200 television sets. w

Unless inadvisable in the light of current investigations

not related to this matter, it is suggested that Cleveland con-
sider requesting Indianapolis or Chicago to locate and inter-
view MAINER to determine his alibi for 10/14/58 and

11/4/58. .

Cleveland should also consider setting out jleads to have
FLOREA interviewed along the same lines and ‘the fingerprints
of MAINER, FLOREA, VINCENTI, Etal, mentioned in reairtel
should be .examined by the. Latent Fingerprint Section for
comparisons with the latents developed on the five gallon

oil can recovered at the Allegheny Valley Airport on 11/5/58.
