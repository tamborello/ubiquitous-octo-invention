KEN FLANERY, who reportedly "set up" the recent
attempted hijacking of the Canadian Country Club is a close
friend of Informant, Informant has heard similar rumors about
FLANERY and although he considers him capable of such an
act, he does not believe FLANERY would become involved in any
hijacking inasmuch as FLANERY has "too much to lose" in
connection with the building and construction business,
Informant recalled that FLANERY's name had also been mentioned
in connection with the hijacking of the Pennsylvania Club in 1963
when it was being operated by GEORGE BARNES. Informant said
BARNES had talked to FLANERY at that time and had elimimted
him as.a suspect.

Informant stated he too has been accused of having
a part in the attémpted hijacking of the Canadian Country Club,
possibly because he is a former employee and is presently
"somewhat .at odds" with FLETCHER HANDLEY, owner of the Canadian
Country Glub. Informant :talked to GEORGE BARNES and JUNK
JOHNSTON the previous week and is certain he convinced them
that he had no part in the attempted hijacking. (BARNES and
JOHNSTON operate the gambling room at the Canadian Country
Club.) ;

Informant said that BARNES uses R. D. MATHEWS, a
Dallas, Texas, hoodlum, as a strong-arm man, but that to
