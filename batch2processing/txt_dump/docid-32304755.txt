They questioned informant as to his financial means and

told him they would make a report to "YONNIE," "YONNIE"
subsequently told the informant that he had received a report
that the informant had money and did not need any more.
"YONNIE" said he would not approve the loan in view of this
report. —

“Commission” but that he is sickly now and lives in either

Mexico or Los Angeles, He said FRANK MILANO hs a brother, ;

power and might be considered on the fringe. He said. TONY ; :

because of his brother FRANK, He said that at the present

time, JOHN SCALISH is the top man in the Cleveland area and

that JOHN DE MARCO is his lieutenant. He commented that

these two attended the Apalachin meeting in 1957, and that

the reason there were so many in attendance at the Apalachin

meeting was because each "Commission" member brought along

bodyguards because they always fear for their lives and

wanted somebody along for their own protection. Informant

they are located clear across the United States. \

With regard to JAMES LICAVOLI, aka., Jack White,

Cleveland areas. He said LICAVOLI does not come under
SCALISH but that SCALISH certainly holds more power than
LICAVOLI, He said he also met LICAVOLI while the informant
and LICAVCLI were serving terms in the United States ; \
Penitentiary at Levenworth many years ago.

 

During the interview, the name AL POLIZZI was. “

business in Cleveland is TONYNPANZARELLA, who is closely a
associated with ALEX SHONDORABIRNS in the numbers business.
He added that the numbers business in Cleveland is operated
_ almost exclusively by Negroes, except for the clearing-
house layoff which has been handled by BIRNS. He stated
that in his opinion the Negroes would not stand still for f
any payoffs to “the outfit" in the Cleveland area since
business has been bad for a number of years and they just
could not afford it. He added that another reason, in his
opinion, “the outfit" is not in the numbers business in a
Cleveland is the fact that they do not need it and they do . :
not Want the headaches it would cause since apparently
' JOHN T, SCALISH, through his interest in the Desert Inn
in Las Vegas, gets enough to take care of himself and his
associates in Cleveland without resorting to the numbers
usiness.

With regard to TONY and JIMMY LA FATCH, who he
feels are definitely members of "the outfit" in Akron,
Ohio, these individuals used to control the numbers business
in the. City of Akron and today probably exert some control
over bookmaking in that city. ‘
; _ With regard to Trumbull and Mahoning Counties in
Ohio, informant stated that in his opinion this is the
territory of JAMES LICAVOLI, aka., Jack White, He stated
that in his opinion, WHITE inherited this territory from
FRANK CAMMARATA, who was ordered deported several years ago.
He stated that it has always been his impresion that WHITE
answers to PETE LICAVOLI in Detroit rather than JOHN T.
SCALISH in Cleveland, ‘

He added that WHITE is never seen with SCALISH.
He stated that WHITE does, however, make occasional trips
to Florida and Hot Springs, Arkansas.

He stated that it was his understanding that WHITE
was given the Warren and Youngstown, Ohio, territory by PETE
LICAVOLI, and that TONY "DOPE" DELSANTER is WHITE's : !
lieutenant in that territory and is probably a member of
“the outfit."
