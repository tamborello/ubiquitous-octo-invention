MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

 

SUBJECT: ‘Meeting with HSCA Chief Counsel G. Robert -Blakey

1, In the course of a meeting with Mr, Blakey this morning, we
discussed the method by which questions would be put to the agent
in Mexico, It developed that he has in mind two agents, the one about
whom we knew (Durant) and one with which we were not familiar
(Manuel Calvillo), I think he was not entirely clear as to these two
people, although his alternative approaches place on us a requirement
to be sure that we identify them properly for purposes of his questions.
They are discussed below:

a.» Durant. He recalled that Durant operated the photo-
graphic surveillance post of the Soviet Embassy. I told
him that I understood that Durant was in charge of the
Cuban coverage,

be Manuel Calvillo. He understood that Calvillo ran the
_ Cuban photographic surveillance site. Beyond this,
however, Calvillo was of interest to him for other
reasons. Elena Garo dePaz told of seeing Oswald at
various parties. in Mexico City, at the time of his
visit there in 1963, She also said that 'a couple of
days" after the assassination of President Kennedy,
Calvillo picked her up, took her to a hotel and inter-
rogated her,

2. Given the possible confusion of who operated the Cuban and
Soviet OPs, Mr. Blakey said that he would want the individuals
correctly identified and have the questions addressed to them.

3, Additionally, Mr. Blakey wants such information as we have

on Calvillo. : . :
