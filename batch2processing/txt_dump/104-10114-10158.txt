FROM : M. D. Stevens
SUBJECT: OSWALD CASE

1. Reference is made to the attached copy of an incoming
State Department telegram dated 19 December 1963, in connection vith
the Harvey Lee OSWALD Case (see fab A). This telegram concerns a Mr.
and Mrs. DEMOBRENSCHILDT who appear to have lived in Dalles, Texas,
but on 2 June 1963 went to Haiti end have not since returned to the
United States,

2. According to this telegran, the DEMOBRENSCHIIDTs vere
interviewed at Port au Prince on 19 December 1963 at which time they
stated that they left Dalles on for New York

Philadelphia; and returned to Dallas for two days near the end of Mey
final arrangements for their trip to Haltl; but aia not contact
OSWALD on their May visit to Dalles.

3. The above referred to incoming telegram makes reference to

prior messages of which I have not received copies anf it is impossible
to determine what connection the DEMOBRENSCHILDTs bave with the OSWAID
Case. The telegram refers to the fact that Mra. DEMOBRENSCHILDE believed
she "saw gun at apartment" in Oakleaf, a Dallas suburb. (The Eew York
Times of 20 December 1963, in referring to the arrest of Russell W. NcLARRY
of Dallas on charges of having threatened on 21 Novezber 1963 that he was
going to kill Presidéit Kennedy the next day, stated that McLARRY lives in
an apartment house "in the Oakeliff section of Dallas, a sprawling area
where OSWALD lived". (See paragraph -3 of Tab A). It appears from information
in the telegram tit the DEMORRENSCHIID?s were well acquainted with the
OSWAIDs. Mre. DEMOHRENSCHILDT took Mrs. OSWALD in her ear from Fort Worth

. to Dallas for dental treatment. & week or two after they first met OSWAID.

; 4, According to Mr. and Mrs. DEMOBRENSCHILOT, they ware
interested in the OSWALDs solely in helping them as “unfortunate people",
J They named the following Pperseys who might have additional information
Aan / regarding the OSWALDs: Samuelj BALLEN, an, investment banker in Dallas,

 

to whom OSWALD applied for a > Theo, MELLER and his Russian wife.

‘ (See Tab A, paragraphs 5 and 6) Security Yndices contain no information

“!\ on BALLEN or MELLER. BALLEN was mentioned 6 length in a Washington Post
article on 1 December 1963 as a petroleum economist who interviewed OSWALD
for a job.
