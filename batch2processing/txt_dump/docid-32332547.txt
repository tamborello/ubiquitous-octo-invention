-At 8:30 p.m. today, the writer had a confidential
talk with HUMBERTO LOPEZ, SR., who advised that the leaders of
the Cuban Liberation Front had agreed not to carry out reprisals
against WOBA,. since the company was not really a threat to the
{ plans of the Front. However, they discussed the possibility

: of a terrorist attack against Mr. EMILIO MILIAN, Program and
News Director of that radio station, since he was the only one
to blame for the attacks against the Front made by that radio
station. LOPEZ pointed out that nothing would be done against
MILIAN ‘immediately, and that he is opposed and will continue
\ i to oppose this attack.

  

- HUMBERTO LOPEZ also stated that there really was
an attack on the writer's life, and that this attack had been
carried out by people connected with MAX LESNIK and ORLANDO
BOSCH, since the Cuban Action Movement is practically at war
with the National Liberation Front of Cuba, and ORLANDO
BOSCH feels that the writer is connected with or part of the
Front. Finally, LOPEZ said that LESNIK is now saying that
the writer wants to kill him, and according to LOPEZ, this
seems very strange to him.

. . At 9:30 a.m. today, Mr. RUBEN DARIO came to the
offices of WFAB. He is leader of Abdala and a member of
the propaganda section of the terrorist group "National
Liberation Front of Cuba". DARIO requested a copy of the
AP. cable in- which newsman IKE FLORES: announced an inter-
view with the leader of "Cuban Action." DARIO commented
privately that it was idiotic for ORLANDO BOSCH to have
given a personal interview to newsman FLORES, since if
FLORES were called by a Grand Jury, he would be obliged
to testify about the interview, and naturally, he would
give the name of ORLANDO BOSCH. DARIO said that in the
story, BOSCH tried to link himself with the Liberation
Front, but this is not true, since the Front would never
make any pact with Cuban Action, because BOSCH will not
be careful, and at any moment he may be arrested again.

’ At 9:30 a.m., the writer had a’ confidential talk
with HUMBERTO LOPEZ, SR. who advised that a communique sent
from outside the country advised that Abdala was 4 screen
for a Communist organization called ‘the'National Liberation —
Front of Cuba. This communique stated that RUBEN DARIO

was an sgent of Fidel Castro. LOPEZ said that he is very
suspicious about the Commmist leanings of RUBEN DARIO,

but he has no proof. He also said he has learned that the
communication making these charges was written by ORLANDO
BOSCH, leader of Accion Cubana, based only on the fact

that he is jealous of the work being done by the Liberation
Front. Finally, he said that the Front is trying to prove
that this document was sponsored by ORLANDO BOSCH, and if
they are able to prove this, BOSCH will be murdered by

the men of the. Front. .

conversation he said that one of the principal men of action

‘stated that they are now setting up secret cells, independent
of each other, in various parts of the U.S. and Puerto Rico,
so that in case the 'Feds" aré able to capture one cell,
the others will have no problems. During the long talk
concerning the Front, he said that the movement has
several young men who are American citizens and as such, can
move freely anywhere in the world. Finally, PEREZ said
