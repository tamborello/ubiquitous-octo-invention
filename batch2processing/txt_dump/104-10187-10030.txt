Communists and Leftists; (2) MLN (Kationa] Liberation
Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Cuba Communist Front; and
(3) CCI (Independent Peasants’ Center), radical, anti-Meaican
Government organization, Having been banished from Mexico
until after the 1964 elections for anti-government activities,
MALDONADO is currently in Europe and secking admittance to
the USSR, obstensibly to visit his daughter who is a student
at the Friendship University in Moscow.

3. Alonso AGUILAR Monteverde

AGUILAR is a prominent pro-Communist Mexican intellectual
who is the titular head of the MLN (National Liberation
Movement), rabidly anti-~U.S., pro-Communist front. He is a

Headquarters will note from the above that three lines were disconnected in
order to cover three Yugoslav lines. Two of the lines which were diaconnected
were Cuban Embasay lines, both were not in use by the Cubans, One was in
the apartment which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobas and not occupied by
other Cubans. The other was a telephone in the Cuban Rmbassy which was
never answered, The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas' line moved to the
Embassy. They have also asked fog the telephone company to repair Wo Flehd,
As soon aa these lines are working again, coverage of two of the Yugoslav
Embagay linea will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which

are presumed to have a much higher priority. ~
