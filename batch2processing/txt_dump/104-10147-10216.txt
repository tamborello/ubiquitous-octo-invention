MEMORANDUM FOR : Mr. Ray Reardon
Office of Security.

FROM : S. D. Breckinridge
SUBJECT : Agency Employees with the Surname of
Bishop

1. The Office of Personnel is gathering files of
present and past employees of the Agency who were on
board in the 60's. Attached are brief excerpts from the
OPFs of the first group shown to me by Doris Houdesheldt.

2. I am trying to assemble a book of photographs
of these different employees to show to the two witnesses
who think they knew a man named Morris Bishop in the 60's.
The photograph or photographs that you may have concern-
ing the persons listed on the attached pages as near as
possible to the first half of the 60's would be helpful.

3. I expect to have more names in the near future
and will forward those to you as soon as they are
available.

4. It would be appreciated if you could give this

some priority attention. -,
