Calling attention to yesterday's Washington Post
article on AMLASH, Bolten said this is the first time
Cubela's name and the full extent of his activities have
appeared in print. He said this stems from the SSC's report
on assassinations, which gave the journalist, George Crile,
enough information to permit him to piece the story together.

Thuermer noted that Time magazine editors have offered
the Director an opportunity to comment on the SSC report.
The Director asked Thuermer to decline this offer. Thuermer
also advised that Strobe Talbott has withdrawn his request
to see the Director. :

Bolten reported that he will meet with a member of the
House Ethics Committee team investigating the leak of the
HSC report and that the investigator may also wish to talk
with CIA officers who had access to the report.

Bolten suggested that we maintain a good record of
foreign ‘and public reactions to the SSC report for possible
use with our oversight committees to illustrate damage
resulting from publicity of the report. Bolten stated his
belief that the Agency has been hurt most by allegations
of CIA involvement in Watergate and President Kennedy's
assasSination. In this connection, he said a study on
the Warren Commission will be published by the SSC next
month; the theme they are developing is that, because of
CIA plots against Castro, the latter retaliated and was
connected with President Kennedy's assassination. Bolten
suggested it might be worthwhile to talk with Senators
Schweicker and Gary Hart, the principals behind the study,
as this could prove more damaging domestically than the
SSC report. In response to the Director's query, Bolten
said that the SSC thoroughly investigated- allegations of
CIA involvement in the JFK assassination but could find no
indications of such involvement. Chamberlain added that,
although investigations could not prove that Castro knew
about CIA plots against him and took retaliatory action
against JFK, they did not disprove this either.

Bolten reported difficulties encountered yesterday
when SSC Counsel Fritz Schwartz objected to an OGC staffer
reading a portion of the SSC's final report. He asked to
be advised of any further problems in this regard.

In response to a note received from the DCI yesterday,
Bolten assured that the Agency would not make any substantive
comments on the SSC's final report. The Director said we
must be careful not to leave the impression that the Agency

-is endorsing the report.
