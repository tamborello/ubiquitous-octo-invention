NOTE: SL 1495-E (former) (Bureau file 134-19686) was operated

' from January, 1970, to approximately September, 1971,
primarily targeted against White Hate Groups. In 1971, he traveled
to Savannah, Georgia, at which time he reported on activities of the
National States Rights Party office and that Jerry Ray, brother of
James Earl] Ray, stated he new there was another party involved in
the killing of King and that his brother was the one who pulled the
trigger. This is the apparent HSCA interest in informant.

Referenced communications concern previous informal
requests by the HSCA that we contact SL 1495-E to determine if he
would be willing to be interviewed by the Committee. St. Louis con-
tacted informant on 1/27/78 and he agreed, but two days later submitted
a letter to St. Louis declining to be interviewed by the HSCA, Subse-
quently, the HSCA determined informant's identity through its investi-
gation and contacted him, at which time, according to the HSCA, he
agreed to interview. By letter to the Attorney. General dated 1 /26/"8,
the HSCA has asked for all information at FBI Headquarters and in

the field concerning informant.

 

This matter has been coordinated with SA D, O, Coulson,
Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel Division,
and SA M. V. Hale, Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal
Investigative Division.
