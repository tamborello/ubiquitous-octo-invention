Re your airtel 11/17/61 captioned "Criminal Intelligence

Program, New Orleans Division, We " In referenced
airtel you advised that PCI has received
information in the form of an unconfirmed rumor that Marcello

returned to the United States after deportation to Guatemala
in a shrimp boat operated by Felix Golina, Patterson, Louisiana.

By return airtel advise the Bureau the results of
the file review in your office for Felix Golina, Patterson,
Louisiana, and state whether or not there is any indication
he has had previous contacts or been in association with
Marcello.

You should insure that if additional information is

Bureau informed of further developments. q

This has been the subject of memorandum for the Director and a
