File No. April. 28, 1970

MR.KEITH HOSKINGS.

On April 20, 1970, a check of records of New
Scotland Yard, London, England, reflected that KEITH
HOSKINGS was born. October 8, 1928, in St. Kitts, British
West Indies. He arrived in’ the United Kingdom in 1958
and resides with his mother at 16, Gap Road, Wimbledon,
London. §.W. 19. In 1960 he was arrested and convicted
for theft and as of April 27, 1970 was about to be ar~
rested again by Metropolitan’ Police, London, for larceny
of money from his employer,

On April 24, 1970, Detective: Sergeant ‘FRED
PARISH, New Scotland. Yard, London, interviewed HOSKINGS
at his residence. He described HOSKINGS as a white male
with West Indian accent. He has persisted in saying to
the police that he was not well enough to stand trial
for his present offence of larceny from his employer and
it is believed that the letters he has written to the
F.B.1. at Washington and Dallas, as well as letters to '
American Embassy, London, U.S. Air Force Headquarters, -
England, and New Scotland Yard, London, have-all been an
attempt on his part to say that he has been cooperating
with New Scotland Yard and the F.B.1. in solving major
crimes, which he hoped would act in mitigation for his t
current offense ‘of larceny ; from his employer.

‘ When interviewed by Sgt. PARISH, he professed
intimate knowledge of all the current major crimes in London,
including a kidnaping and murder case and an espionage case
currently béing tried. He also claimed to have been a member

of she Mafia sent to England, .

“ Sergeant. PARISH is of the opinion that because of

; subject's mental instability he ‘thought he mightebe immedi-.
ately: brought to the. U. ‘S.. to assist U.S. authorities, thus
saving. himself: from; being, arrested and sentenced. cin London.
