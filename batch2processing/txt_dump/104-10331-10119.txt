1. This is to convey our appreciation for the fine briefing
tha provided on 16 October to the JFK Assassination
Records Review Board (ARRB). The Board was appointed by
President Clinton under a statue establishing the Board to
oversee the release of all government records related to the
assassination of President Kennedy. The briefing was part of a
program that, included a meeting with Executive Director Slatkin,
the DDO, and the General Counsel.

2. Judge John Tunheim (ARRB Chairman) and the other four
Board members, as well as their Executive Director and General
Counsel, all told me that they found Tom's briefing interesting
and informative. They appreciated Tom's helpful responses to the
various questions that they asked about the functions and
organization of the Ops Center.

3. Tom's performance was professional and reflected a good
knowkedge of his responsibilities. His enthusiasm and ability to
put the activities of the Ops Center in perspective clearly made
a positive impression on the visitors.

4. Thanks for making Tom available for the Board's visit.
His efforts contributed to the good relationship that the Agency
has maintained with the Board.
