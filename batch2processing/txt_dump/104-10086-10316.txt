SUBJECT

 

1. We would like to take time out in our investigation of the President's i
assassination to appraise the role of the Mexico City Station in the whole affair.
Since the early afternoon of 22 November 1963, Mexico City has been the only
major overseas reporter in the case. While this is p stly dictated by the
facts of Lee OSWALD's life, we have not overlooked - ceally outstanding per-
formance of Mexico City's major assets and the spee; ‘precision, and perception
with which the data was forwarded. Here it wa <i within minutes to the
White House, ODACID, and ODENYY.

   
  
  
  
   

 

2. Your LIENYOY data, the statenents. o! ilvia DURAN, and your analyses
were major factors in the quick clar ‘ati

ion of the case, blanking out the really
ominous spectre of foreign backing:

able to send you so little information in

for a jump to Tia Juana. We have quickly
he whole case but we do not yet have a copy for
romise your sources. Basically, what the New York !

3. We have meanwhile been flooded with fabrications, of which the ALVARADO
story was the most troublesome. They are still coming in. .

CONTINUATION OF
s DISPATCH

 

 

-4. You have ha@ good support from your liaison, but as usual the really
outstanding features were Mexico Station's famous generalship and the skill and
devotion of its personnel. Please convey our admiration to all who participated,
down to the last technician, translator, and monitor. We know that the work
your Station did during the President's 1962 visit made you feel this tragedy

with particular keemess, as did we.
