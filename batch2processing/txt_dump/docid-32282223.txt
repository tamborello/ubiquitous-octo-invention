HW 53244

This meeting is complicated by a 14 May 1972 memorandum (which
is in your folder). It describeds the 7 May meeting in terms of
obfuscation, avoiding any discussion of "assassination."' I view
this as clearly a cover memorandum -- Senator Church will probably
view it as an indication that Kennedy did not approve or mow about

the assassination program.

Interesting Note: Helms recalls that the State Department had
a man engaged in a full-time effort to try and arrange a group to

take over the government of Cuba upon the assassination of Castro.

 

Post-1961 Specific Phase II Operations.
(1) On 18 April 1962 poison pills were delivered by CIA Sy

 

item to Harvey to be sent into Cuba. Later memoranda indicate
that these pills were actually sent to Cuba. Additionally, memo -
randa indicate that the pills were "in place" ready for the attempt.

(2) Guns and explosives were given by Harvey and JMWAVE Chief
Shackley to Cuban asset Verona at a cost of $5,000.

(3) In June of 1962 and later in September documents indicate
that three-man teams were sent into Cuba by Harvey's operatives for
assassination attempts. Indeed, in December 1962/January 1963 a
$2700 payment was made by Harvey to Verona for expenses’ of the

three-man teams. : ¢

 

Docld: 32282223 Page 3
(4) April/May 1963. Helms approves Harvey's meeting with
Roselli as a kind of "close-out" of the Roselli relationship.

FBI has Roselli under surveillance -- calls Harvey and says they
must tell Hoover -- Harvey calls Helms -- Helms says no need to
brief McCone. Note: Senator Church may view this as another indi-
cation of Helms acting on his own.

(5) In 1963 CIA's TSD implements a skin-diving suit with
poison and proposes a scheme regarding an exploding seashell.
Helms will say they were only wacky proposals by underlings which
never got anywhere. While this may be true as to the latter, the
skindiving suit/TSD must have had his approval -- TSD reports
directly to DDP.

@ (6) October 1963. Des Fitzgerald (now deceased) goes to
Paris to meet Cuban asset Cubella. Cubella wants to assassinate
Castro. Documents indicate that Helms tells Fitzgerald he may
use the Attorney General's name without seeking approval from

Kennedy.

   

(7) Circa November 22, 1963. % CIA prepares poison
pen which is delivered-to Cubella in Paris. Documents unclear as
to whether Cubella accepts it or not.

(8) 7 March 1966. Helms sends memorandum to Secretary Rusk
denying Agency use of Cubella in assassination scheme. While Helms
may have a technical interpretation which makes the memorandum cor-

rect it doesn't disclose any of the CIA's contacts with Cubella.

Note: This again be used to argue no executive approval.
