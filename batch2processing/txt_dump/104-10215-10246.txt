1 Regarding reference (a) the Station concurs fully with the proposed promotion
: of Arthur G. Vaivada and desires also at this time to bring to the attention
of Headquarters the merits of granting Vaivada stelf status either
concurrently with the cromotion or as soon thereafter as may prove feasibles

2. be agent himself has expressed a keen interest in acquiring such status,

“for a mmber of obvious reasons. As a contract agent, Veivada has not been
entitled tc the standard step increases that accrue to regular GS enployees .
Horeover he has not had the venefix of recent legislative increases in basic
salary rates, such that his salary, originally set 16 August 1954 st the then
GS-9 level, is still $5060.CO per anmum. Perhaps of more importance than

‘ the foregoing considerations is the fact that this agent. has been and is ‘
losing out in terms of the retirement, health insurance, and otner more lonz-
term advantages available to steff personnel. The agent has several tines

   
    
  
 

... he is not receiving retirement credits with his years of services Vaivada's -
expressed career interests lie in contimed employment by KUBARK, more
especially in the area of | Jassignments in the field, and in
view of his qualities of character end high level of performance for KUBARK
the Station has no hesitation in recommending to Headcuarters that he be
awarded the desired change in status.

 

 

In view of the agent's present salary level it is reconmended‘that the
’ pronotion from his present grade be to the equivalent of a GS-10 at a per

 

annum _salary_ of _§5,915.00.._If_ Headcuarters_concurs_in_the_recomnendation—
