in the church's
was being sought

SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH,

on about July 13, 1959; Father FUSCO asked PCI if he would

give SAM MANNARINO a thorough physical
replied that if cancer were indicated,

examination. PCI
he could do nothing

for MANNARINO,:at which point Father FUSCO indicated he knew
that MANNARINO was suffering.from a malignancy, PCI feels
there are only two reasons why he should be approached to
examine. MANNARINO: éithe SAM MANNARINO is frightened and
looking desperately for other, contrary.medical opinion;

or. MANNARINO -intends to "use" PCI-by having him subpoenaed

at a later date to testify that MANNARINO is too ill to appear
in any court proceeding. PCI wanted to‘know if there was any
reason the FBI would not want him to examine SAM MANNARINO,

and PCI was advised ‘that any decision along this line was his

- alone.

On September 15, 1959, PCI- MoCLOWRY advised that Father _
FUSCO and his chauffeur departed on September 11; 1959, by
jet airline flight to Rome, Italy, purpose of visit unknown,

PCL stated that this ‘trip was. paid. for.
the MANNARINOs., PCI also advised that

in its entirety by
prior to Father

FUSCO's. depature, ‘Father FUSCO told PCI that it would not
be necessary for him to give a physical. examination to
SAMUEL MANNARINO; inasmuch as MANNARINO has become more or
less Pesigned to the inevitability of his death from his

cancer,
