‘Dear David:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 7 November 1995
to Director of Central Intelligence Deutch describing’ the
Assassination Records: Review Board's recent formal deter--
minations with respect to CIA records.

‘The ‘appropriate. Agency components have again reviewed
the 198 documents which the Board has decided to release,
either fully or with some information postponed. With one
potential exception, the Agency does not plan to appeal to
the President for. additional postponements with respect to
the documents listed in your letter. The potential
exception is document no. 104-10017-10015. As we discussed,
the Board, because of a technical error on our part, made a
determination on this:document without having full
information available. We plan to withhold judgement on
this document pending further. review by the Board.

We understand that further review will be needed this
month to determine if additional names in a number of the
documents can be released. We would be pleased to discuss
with the Board and your staff any issues that may arise with
regard to declassifying and releasing CIA-originated ©
information. ; ;

Sincerely,

 

John F. Pereira
