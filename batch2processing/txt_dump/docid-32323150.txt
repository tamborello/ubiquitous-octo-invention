_held criticism of GARCIA’ s remarks because he realized the

fallacy of them; that there was no one to replace GARCIA,

and he (LANDIN) had often, since that rally, wondered if
GARCIA was the right person to head PASO. _ LOWERY and
ESTRADA contended. that’ GARCIA was the ‘logical ‘person for that

‘position since no one else could, at this time, replace hin.

JOE LANDIN. recalled the very fine work GARCIA. had done. He
wondered if getting other PASO members to constructively

 eriticize J.°O. GARCIA when he made such derogatory remarks

would do the. trick ...‘BILL LOWERY and ESTRADA urged ‘him to do
that... JOE LANDIN reported that at the. GI. Forum meeting the
CONTRERAS brothers had. discussed Cuba with him | While the
meeting. was an inforrial one, the discussion had been ‘a good
one. The two brothers believed that the. Cubans could provoke
ae third World ‘War; they were sure that they had created an
economic problem in the U. S. _- competing with other:
minorities forjobs. It seemed they surmised, that all the
rich, Cubans came to the United States while. the. servants

and ‘other menial workers remained slaves in CASTRO's. Cuba.
Their mother, RICHARD CONTRERAS said, had told some Cubans
that the suffering. they claimed to have undergone was really
nothing, ‘that she and her neighbors. had been herded off like
cattle and shipped away from their homes. (CONTREARAS did -
not Ssay., where this, happened.) BILL LOWERY. and. ESTRADA
were glad’ that this discussion had taken place even though,
the’ meeting, ‘had been an informal one. :

 

‘Informant determinéd that Congressman WILLIAM
CLAYTON ° ‘POWELL was discussed by BILL LOWERY, at which time
LOWERYsaid™ he ° did not know what to believe about POWELL,
JOE LANDIN. said he believed the man was an opportunist ; a
bad represéntative for his people. He said he, at one time,
had. attended.an Afro-Asian Conference and pictured America.
as a_haven for Negroes. ESTRADA recalled that POWELL had
gone there to-undo the- good that. PAUL ROBESON had done.

It was stated that WINSTON and DAVIES, two. CP members, had

- even tried to discourage him from making that trip.

‘Informant had no additional information.
