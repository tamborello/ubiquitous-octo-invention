Summary of Deposition of Orest Pena Page 2

'

Pena contends that there is a connection between the
Kennedy assassination and Cuban training camps ‘in New Orleans.
(pp. 14, 15, 28, 33)

Pena did not testify on all relevant issues before
the Warren Commission, because de Brueys had threatened
him before he was scheduled to testify, and because -
Commission Counsel Wesley Liebeler did not cooperate. (pp. 18, 19) °°

. Pena told a number of people, including Mark Lane fa
and Harold Weisberg, that Oswald was an FBI informant. (pp. 20, 21)

In 1975 Pena publicly alleged that Oswald was an FBI informant

on CBS television. (p. 18)

Oswald once entered Pena's, bar with two or three Spanish-
. tooking individuals and ordered lemonade. (pp. 23, 24, 25)

“Pena saw Oswald handing out Fair Play for Cuba Committee
_ pamphlets in New..Orleans. (p. 22) He saw the fight between
Oswald and Bringuier. (p. 22) Pena later F posted bond for
Bringuier. (p: 23) .

“Pena has- ‘been told that he ‘and Oswald each applied for
a passport in New Orleans on June 24, 1963. (p. 25) He does
not remember seeing Oswald at that time. (p. 25, 26) He thinks
che would have remembered seeing Oswald if he and Oswald had
applied at the same time. (p. 26) He does not know why his
name was omitted from a State Department list (Warren Commission
Exhibit 952).which included the names of people who applied
for passports in New Orleans on June 24, 1963. (p..26) He
thinks that his name might have been omitted purposely on
account of ‘his informant status. (pp. 26, 27) Pena does not
believe he traveled to Mexico in the Fall of 1963. (p. 27)
He never saw Oswald in Mexico. (p. 27) He never traveled
to Mexico or to any other countries on any intelligence missions.
