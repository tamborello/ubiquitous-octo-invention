This individual was an official of the Movimiento
~Revolucionario del Pueblo (Peoples Revolutionary Movement ) (MRP)
_ am anti-CASTRO organization, who resigned on May 27, 1961.- :

- In the past; he has reportedly made rather vague, conflicting

|; statements regarding his position on the legality of. the

' Cuban Communist Party (GP). Recently, he hag been mostly
active ‘in Puerto Rico.~ “ : oe

I The following information was submitted by MM T-1,
: an eminent. Cuban physician who is widely acquainted with
. Cuban political leaders and who has furnished reliable
information in the past, on February 19, 19623 u)

MM T-1 stated he had known RAY RIVERO singe the

latter was born, and had observed from time to' time his

leanings from one side to the other amd rather unusual
and contradictory political statements. (¥) (1 )

MM. T-1 stated he learned in Januaty of 1962, that

RAY. was holding conferences in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He

. ascertained that, RAY. and several of his friends, who are
engineers and architects, were holding a series of
conferences on democracy, RAY beeame involved at one of

' big conferencee in a discussion in which he stated he was
a Socialist. When he was asked for elarification by some
of those present, he fell into the evasive manner of
answering which hag been characteristic of the’ political

 

life and activity of RAY. » I Uy) 1c SNE
