’ ADMINISTRATIVE

On 2/21/77, CG 7539-TE advised SA WILLIAM F.
ROEMER, Jr., that ALEX was worried because he had been
subpoenaed and has appeared before the Dade County,
Florida, State's Attorney in regards to the investigation
of the gangland slaying of Chicago hoodlum JOHN ROSELLI.

CG 7539-TE advised that ALEX was very concemed that °
he may be granted immunity in the ROSELLI investigation,
and that this concern has caused ALEX. some anxiety.

a CG 7539-TE stated that ALEX was considering, if
granted immunity, whether he should attempt to "play off"
the State's Attorney by providing inaccurate information,
which would subject him to imprisonment for perjury, or
whether he should just refuse to answer questions and take
a chance on being cited for contempt of court.

For information, a current investigation is being
’ conducted by Chicago in regards. to information that re-impor-

tation of bingo type pinball machines into the Chicago area
is being conducted by Apex Amusements. ALEX and EDDIE VOGEL
are close associates and officers in the Apex Amusements
Corporation. The bingo. machines are reportedly first purchased
and sent to Puerto Rico and then re~imported. Special Attorney
JEFF JOHNSON, Chicago Strike Force, has advised that the bingo
machines are defined as gambling devices by Federal, State
and Local statutes. ~
