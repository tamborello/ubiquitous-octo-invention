REPORT FROM WASHINGTON IN IMMEDIATE SEESNATH OF PRESIDENT" Ss

Prince BERNHARD: left Washington on Monday evening; ‘since
he had to be back in the Netherlands early Tuesday without fail.
Before leaving, he was able to see Mrs. KENNEDY, who received
all the distinguished guests in the White House after the funeral.
The Prince:.was treated with especial courtesy by the Chief of
Staff of the Air Force General LEMAY, who called in person at the
Embassy to take him to the airport, where he made a plane available
to fly him direct to Zolsterberg,

 

 

Princess BEATRIX, after visiting the White House, attended
the reception at the State Department, where she spoke atcsome
length with Mrs, JOHNSON, who was seated between the Dutch
Princess and Queen FREDERIKA of Greece.

Mr. LUNS: left at about 1300 on Tuesday. We had ‘a brief
talk with him that morning. He believes that RUSK will now come
more to the fore, because of JOHNSON's previous preoccupation
with domestic politics. He considers it a favorable:omen ‘that
the new President recently spent three days in Hollahd. LUNS
assumes that there will be no abrupt change in American policy,
but one must be prepared to note nuances, Officially, JOHNSON
has always conformed to KENNEDY's policies, but he has always
been a few degrees more conservative, and it remains to be seen
how much of his earlier outlook will carry over,

The White House atmosphere will undoubtedly change, Bor it is
hard to believe that personal collaborators of KENNEDY such as
BUNDY and SCHLESINGER will be on the JOHNSON team. The influence

of ROSTOW, the planning head in the State Department, could decline,

as will, of course, that of ROBERT KENNEDY,

At the Monday evening reception in the State Department,
JOHNSON had a cordially interested greeting for each guest.
He had a two-handed handshake for LUNS, who was a accompanied by
the Princess and VAN ROIJEN, The former received hearty applause
from the crowd when she left the building.

Americans are deeply appreciative of DE GAULLE's coming
to Washington, but LUNS has not got the impression that there
will be a change intthe American attitude toward France.

At the reception, LUNS had rather long conversations with
ERHARD and Indonesian Defense Minister NASUTION, with which he
was very satisfied, ERHARD had just visited Paris, and it can
easily be guessed what he and LUNS talked about,

LUNS will remain Wednesday in New York. He will arrive in
Amsterdam on Thursday morning and go direct to Strassburg, where
the European Parliament seems quite anxious that he speak as ,
Soon as possible.

On Tuesday, RUSK had talks with several important visitors,
including MIKOYAN, ERHARD, and HOME, He also received a group
of Latin American representatives, In all these talks the
President ((B)) assured hi's guests that American policy | toward
their countries would not change.

On the same day, many people visited President KENNEDY's
grave across the river, Queen FREDERIKA laid an olive wreath
as a symbol of peace,

On Wednesday, President JOHNSON will deliver to the
Congress a speech which is awaited with interest, However, it

does not seem likely that he will hold a press conference this
week, since Thursday is Thanksgiving Day, This was originally
a festival of thanks for the harvest, and later became a day of
general thanksgiving. This year it will be an unprecedentedly
somber day for America, What one can be thankful for at this
moment is that political institutions provide for a quick and
peaceful take-over in the event of the sudden death of the
President.
