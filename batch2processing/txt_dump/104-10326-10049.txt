HEADQUARTERS OF THE KURDISH WORKERS’ PARTY (PKK), THE ANARCHIST

PARTY, AND A BAR WHERE MANY MIDDLE EASTERNERS WOULD CONGREGATE.

HE THEN POINTED OUT THESE PLACES TO IDENS WHEN WE WENT TO HIS

APARTMENT. HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THERE WAS.NO WAY HE COULD DEFEND

HIMSELF FROM ANY ATTACK.

  

    

WHITTEN ALSO STATED THAT HE HAS BEEN RETIRED FOR ALMOST AS
LONG AS HE WORKED FOR THE CIA, AND THAT HE HAS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT LIFE NOW IN VIENNA. HE AND HIS WIFE HAVE LIVED IN
VIENNA APPROXIMATELY 25 YEARS. HE IS A MEMBER OF VARIOUS MUSICAL
AND ART SOCIETIES. HE SINGS IN A PROMINENT VIENNA MEN’S CHOIR.
HE HAS PUBLISHED VARIOUS ARTICLES ON MUSIC (HIS SPECIALITY IS
JOHANN STRAUSS). HE HAS RECEIVED MANY MEDALS FOR HIS WORK IN THE
ARTS IN VIENNA WHICH WE SAW WHEN WE WENT TO HIS APARTMENT.

WHITTEN IS ALSO GREATLY WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE
COMMITTED PERJURY WHEN APPLYING FOR AUSTRIAN RESIDENCY BY STATING
HE WORKED | HE BELIEVES THIS. COULD
SUBJECT HIM TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES IN AUSTRIA. HE STATED ON .
SEVERAL OCCASIONS, SHOULD HIS AFFILIATION BECOME KNOWN, HE WOULD
HAVE TO LEAVE AUSTRIA. ON OTHER OCCASIONS, HE STATED THAT HE
WOULD TURN HIMSELF IN TO THE VIENNESE AUTHORITIES AND OFFER HIS
SERVICES AS. A CONSULTANT TO THE POLICE OR INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.
HE OBVIOUSLY WAS EXTREMELY DISTRAUGHT AND WAS VOICING WHAT HE
BELIEVED WERE HIS OPTIONS SHOULD HIS NAME BE RELEASED BY THE
BOARD, ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT DECIDED ON A PARTICULAR COURSE OF
ACTION. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHITTEN WAS ADAMANT THAT NO MATTER,
WHAT HAPPENS HE WOULD NEVER BETRAY THE CIA BY TELLING ANYONE ABOUT
HIS WORK AS AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.

 

 

 

BY THE END OF THE EVENING, WHITTEN STATED THAT HE FELT MUCH
BETTER ABOUT THE STATE OF EVENTS. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, IDEN B
‘HAD ASSURED HIM THAT CIA WAS DOING EVERYTHING TO PROTECT HIM AND
IDEN A STATED HE WOULD ARGUE, FOR HIS PROTECTION TO THE BOARD. HE
CLEARLY LOOKED UPON IDENS AS HIS ALLIES IN THIS PROCESS AND EVEN
STATED THAT HE HAD A "WONDERFUL" DAY TALKING TO IDENS. IDENS
‘LEFT HIM, THEY BELIEVE, FEELING HAPPY AND CONFIDENT ALL WOULD TURN
OUT WELL. -

_ AFTER THE MEETING, IDENS SPOKE ABOUT HOW THIS ISSUE WOULD BE
HANDLED BY THE BOARD. IDEN A BELIEVED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN
LIKELY THAT THE BOARD WOULD AGREE TO PROTECT HIM AND THAT HE WOULD
MAKE THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT HE COULD TO THEM. THE BOARD WILL MAKE
ITS DECISION IN IT’S NEXT MEETING IN MID-MAY. IDEN B DID NOT
THINK IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR ANYONE FROM CIA TO COME DOWN TO
THAT MEETING. WE AGREED THAT SHOULD THE BOARD MAKE THE
REPREHENSIBLE DECISION OF RELEASING WHITTEN’S NAME, THAT WE COULD
NOT IMAGINE A STRONGER CASE ON WHICH TO BRING AN APPEAL TO THE
PRESIDENT.

 

  
       
       
   

 

3. IDEN B EXTENDS HER THANKS FOR ARRANGING
THE INTERVIEW AND HER HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS. SHE SAID EVERYTHING
WENT EXTREMELY SMOOTHLY. HQS WILL APPRISE BOARD’S
DECISION REGARDING WHITTEN (PROBABLY MID-MAY). REGARDS.

VERGE OF TEARS. ALTHOUGH IDEN B WAS EXPECTING HIM TO BE ANGRY
WITH CIA AND THE BOARD, INSTEAD, HE CLEARLY FELT HURT AND .
BETRAYED. HIS OBVIOUS PHYSICAL PROBLEMS ADD TO THIS FEELING OF
BEING VULNERABLE. PHYSICALLY HE IS NOT WELL; HE IS PARALYZED ON
