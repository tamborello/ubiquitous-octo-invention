Mr. Genzman. Do you know why SIG had this particular
responsibility?

Mr. Hartman. That's the way the staff was set up.
Primarily, of course, when the staff was set up, someone had to
be concerned with the problem of Americans who were dealing wit
or playing footsy with the Bloc outside of the U.S. -

In the U.S., the Bureau did it; outside the U.S. it was th
Agency's responsibility, in coordination with the FBI.

But we have never had an American Desk, so to speak. In
other words, we have had branches covering the world except the
United States, and so it had to be placed somewhere, and
inasmuch as a defector becomes a counterintelligence concern, I
presume that's why SIG was given that chore.

Mr. Genzman. Thank you.

I would next like to show you a document which is labeled
according to a CIA page number -- |

Mr. Hartman. . May I insert something?

The Office of Security also, of course, dealt with
questions concerning Americans, and in particular if Americans
were applying for employment, but also other cases, cranks and
all sorts of weirdos and that type of thing; so it is not
inconceivable tht the Office of Security within the Agency migh

have come into play here. I don't know.

Mr. Genzman. I would next like to show you a document

labeled, "CIA page 788." That is a 201 file opening form used

DoclId: 37263403 Page 9
1 to open the file on Lee Harvey Oswald?
. e 2 Mr. Hartman. Right.
3 Mr. Genzman. Have you seen this page before?
4 Mr. Hartman. Oh, many times.
5 Mr. Genzman. Why was the file opened by CI/SIG?
6 Mr. Hartman. I really cannot give you a factual answer, .

7 but I can make a supposition based on the way things were

operating at the time.

8
9 Inasmuch as SIG had the responsibility concerning Americang,

10 they would have received traffic concerning Oswald, and I know

iW that as a result of, the postassassination period that they

12 received traffic before the assassination. I did noteknow it
e@ 13 at the time, of course; and having received documents concernin

14 a person, when you begin to accumulate several, instead of

15 just keeping them loosely somewhere, you can and are permitted

16 to open a 201 file in order to have an orderly, structured

7 situation; also in order to permit the indexing of that

18 person's name, that would then lead a searcher to that file.

19 Mr. Genzman. Do you know why the file was opened by Ann

Egerter?

20 ;

21 Mr. Hartman. Well, she was one o£ the employees in SIG, on

22 of the senior analysts, and a very learned lady; and she at tha

93 time, I presume, and I know now as a result of postassassinatio

9° information, that she had some cables and some papers concernin
@

Oswald; therefore, she would have opened the file.

1 question about transition and exactly who would take over and
2 so on.
3 Mr. Genzman. Thank you.
4 At this time, Mr. Hartman,.I would like to ask you questions
5 ‘with regard to several documents which we will now show you.
6 The first document is labeled "JFK Exhibit F-534." It is
7 a cable dated October 31, 1959, from the U.S. Embassy in
8 Moscow to the Department of State, which discusses Lee Harvey

Oswald's desire to defect.

9
10 Would you please read this cable at this time?
nN Mr. Hartman. Let's go off for a second.
2 (Discussion off the record.)

@ 13 Mr. Hartman. I have read it.
14 Mr. Genzman. Which component at CIA Headquarters would
1s have received this information?
16 Mr. Hartman. ‘I honestly don't know, because I had no
v7 connection with the case at that time. I really don't know. I
18 "presume that it would have been SIG of the ‘cr staff... “If che
19 cI staff at all received it, I presume it would have been the
20 SIG Section, because this man was an American and SIG primarily
21 dealt with counterintelligence problems concerning Americans.
22 . Mr. Genzman. Did SIG deal with American defectors and

23 similar cases?
24 Mr. Hartman. It was within their general responsibility,

25 yes.

1 i) until I left the agency.

During the first period I dia ad hoc chores; whatever was

3 given to me, I did.

4 I was also given a very general chore of keeping -- well,’
5 let's change that ~- of making certain that the file was being
6 kept in as good an order as we could under the circumstances.

7 The second period, however, auring the second period I was

8 in effect the custodian of the file, made sure that the paper

9 flowed into it, whatever paper came to us, and, that the file wa

10 generally in good order.

1 | This does not_mean -~ I want to insert —-- this does not

12 mean that I personally did the filing and all of the computer
© 13 work that was entailed. As I said, I was mainly charged with

14 making certain that the file was kept in that order, but I

15 didn't do the direct work.

16 Mr. Genzman. How long were you in charge of maintaining
i ?
17 the file?
18 Mr. Hartman. Until I left the Agency.
“49 Mr. Genzman. Which was in 1975?
20 Mr. Hartman. 1976.
21 Mr. Genzman. Excuse me.
22 Who took over your position when you left with regard to
the file?
23

24 Mr. Hartman. I was told that it was a fellow named Russ

25 ‘Holmes, but I wasn't certain of that. I think there was a

can work that out with the people at the Agency.

Mr. Genzman. That is correct, and if you have any problems
or any questions about any of our questions, we can go off the
record and discuss it.

Mr. Hartman. That would be fine. I just want to be sure
that you understand that I don't know who retired under cover
and who is still working under cover, and I wouldn't want to
jeopardize anybody who has a cover situation.

Mr. Genzman. Please understand that the deposition will
be classified and that declassification is something that will
have to be worked out with the Agency.

Mr. Hartman. Right.

Mr. Genzman. Mr. Hartman, what was your position in 1963
and 1964?

Mr. Hartman. I was an operations officer in the Counter-
intelligence Staff.

Mr. Genzman. Whom did you work under?

Mr. Hartman. My immediate boss was Raymond G. Rocca,
R-o-c-c-a.

Mr. Genzman. Did you have any expertise in records and

filing?

Mr. Hartman. Well, yes, records.
Mr. Genzman. What specific component did you work in?
Mr. Hartman. Within the staff, you mean?

Mr. Genzman. Yes.

263408 Page 5
1 Mr. Hartman. The Research and Analysis Group.
2 Mr. Genzman. Would you explain the functions of that groug?
3 Mr. Hartman. The functions of the group were very broad

4 and I don't really know because of compartmentization exactly
5 " what everybody did; but I did know my functions, of course, and
6 some of my colleagues, but I had no way of knowing all of the

7 functions of all the people.

8 Mr. Genzman. Would you classify yourself as a records
9 expert?
10 Mr. Hartman. Well, let's put it a little differently: I
i think I would: be considered an expert to a degree in- the Agency {s
12 clandestine service records system. I am not an overall
e@ 13 records expert and never have claimed to be.
14 Mr. Genzman. In the course of your duties with the CIA.
15 did you ever do any work in conjunction with the investigation
16 of the Kennedy assassination?
17 Mr. Hartman. Yes, such as the Agency was doing.
18 Mr. Genzman. Would you briefly explain your duties and
19 functions?
20 Mr. Hartman. Well, you could break it down into two
21 general periods: One period was during the time immediately
22 following the assassination through the period of the existence
23 of the Warren Commission. ‘
@ 24 ‘The second period ~- again, this will be a general term --
25 would be following the dissolution of the Warren Commission and
