The file indicates that she and Subject were married
on October 14, 1961, in Tlahuapan, Puebla. Q/u)

According to this file, Subject was deported from

Mexico on 6/4/62, via Braniff Airlines destined for San Antonio, :
for furnishing false information, The details of this false
information are not set out. However, Attorney JORGE VAZQUEZ
ROBLES advised it appeared that Subject had a permit only to
make a study as to establishing a business in Mexico, whereas

he actually established business with offices at Sinaloa

#19-201, Mexico City. we)

The file contains a business card indicating the name
of this business as Richard 8. Cain y Asociades, VAZQUEZ advised
that this was an academy for teaching lie detection and police
matters, He stated that Subject gave classes in the use of lie
detection equipment at the Banco de Mexico and to the Fiscal
Police of the Treasury Department, He actually carried credentials
from this latter agency. He was also known at the Jefatura
(Metropolitan, Police) and the Judicial Police of the Federal
District. Ln )

reference to his association with ROMAN LUGO of the Judicial . !
Police and Dr, QUIROZ CUARON of the Banco de Mexico, Ly)

An order from the Ministry of the Interior was placed I.
‘ to deny Subject the right to re-enter Mexico, However, this ‘
4 order was later ified so that he technically could re-enter ;

Mexico as an imigrante rentista. In this connection, he deposited !
180,000 pesos ($14,400 US.) with the Banco Nacional de Mexico.

It is indicated that Subject*s attorney was JORGE
CASTILLO Z.,; 32 Plaza de la Republica, fa)

This matter was discussed unofficially with Attorney
JORGE VASQUEZ ROBLES of the Mexican Immigration Service, who
advised that from Subject*s file with the Mexican Government,
he could legally be in Mexico for a limited stay and under the
limited conditions imposed on tourists, However, he advised
that the Mexican Government would be most interested in learn-
ing if the Subject were in Mexico and of any activities on the
part of the Subject in Mexico, There is an inference that the
Mexican Government might request CAIN to depart if he were -
located within Mexico, Mus

In the absence of any specific leads, no further
investigation is being conducted concerning this Subject. Oa)
