5. Mr. Helms' 3 dune 1964 memorandum for the Warren Commission on
the de Mohrenschiidts ts attached at C. it describes the Agency's
interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de Mohrenschildt in 1957 as a
result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year. Contact Division (now
Domestic Coliection Division - DCB) had its resident agent in Dallas,
Mr..J. Walton Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschiidt at that time. The

’ history of Mr. Moore's relationship with Mr. de Mohrenschildt from 1957
to .1961 is also attached at C. As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested
“traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt. The trace results (attached at DB) con-
tained sufficient derogatory information to preclude further extensive
contact with the de Mohrenschildts. (An OS summary on Mr. de Mohrenschildt
prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D.)

6. Our files show that a mail cover was placed on letters addressed
to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to |
1966. (This was probably not uncovered at the time of the external in-
vestigations.) This included opening and photographing the contents of:
some letters by the CIA Station there. The results of this operation
were shared with the FBI.

7. Mr. de Mohrenschildt came to the attention of this office during
the Rockefeller Commission investigations. We were asked to respond to a
memorandum submitted to the Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled "CIA
Activities and the Warren Commission Investigation." Mr. Hoch called for
an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and
asked what Mr. Moore knew about Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de
Mohrenschildt about him. Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission is
attached at E.

8. The most recent information we have on Mr. de Mohrenschildt comes
from Mr. J. Walton Moore wno was contacted in May and Juiy 1976 by writers
connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press andthe Deli
Publishing Company. Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and
Mr. de Mohrenschildt. Mr. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached
at F. . . :

Conciusions:

9. Mr. de Mohrenschildt appears to have lead an adventurous and
colorful life as a petroleum engineer and businessman. He is’ both weil

and poorly connected, and some of his association’Nin the past. have
raised serious questions. Certainly his relationship with the
Oswalds ‘has caused him considerable trouble and may nave caused this
Agency and the FBI to spend more time and energy on him in the past
than was necessary. : ; ,

10. Both the FBI and this Agency, however, had dropped their
interests in Mr. de Mohrenschildt’s activities by the mid-to-late
1960's. We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could
either be from local authorities in Dalijas or. from media representa-
tives on the trail of a-warmed over story concerning the assassination
of President Kennedy. We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond
Mr. Moore's reports attached at F. What we can say is that we have
‘found no indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active
interest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent years. . ; -
