17. Remarks (continued) :

The Pittsburgh Office is looking for a great deal more, as

far as specific criminal intelligence information is concerned,
in relation to the GENOVESE-LA ROCCA organization. In my -
opinion the position of prominence this phase of our activity
has attained, as well as the issuance of recent Bureau
instructions in this regard, and the information received thus
far by the Pittsburgh Office justifies the continuation of this
installation.

The Bureau will be promptly advised of the extent of any
possible violations developed as a result of this technical
surveillance. The LA ROCCA investigation and this coverage in
particular is being given my personal attention on a continuing
basis and I will insure that constant efforts are made to
establish a Federal violation against this individual. When
information of immediate interest or significance is received, i
it will be promptly brought to the Bureau's attention in the
daily teletype being submitted relative to LA ROCCA.

IN VIEW OF THE CONVICTION OF LA ROCCA FOR ASSAULT WITH INTENT

TO KILL AND HIS ARREST FOR CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON, HE MAY
BE ARMED AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.

Insert to FD-143 entitled, "JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUATION OF
TECHNICAL OR MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCE. "

The most important information furnished by this informant
since the submission of the last FD-143 on 3/22/62
concerns a meeting of JOHN CONTI, alleged nephew of
SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, who is general manager at

the North Star Cement Block Company in Pittsburgh, and
SAMUEL MANNARINO of the MANNARINO organization of New :
Kensington, Pa., on whom an intensification target-type bo,
investigation is being conducted. It was noted by the :
informant that these two met last on a business Proposition 7
,on Sunday, 6/3/62.

It was indicated that MANNARINO owns 600 acres of ground
and is now dealing with the North Star Cement Block Company
to build homes on his property. Thebbuilding of 123 — :
of these homes was to begin immediately and it was '
indicated that MANNARINO is definitely part of the
entire proposition.

As a result of this information, the Bureau has advised
that this matter should be given thorough investigative
attention in connection with disruption objectives

and Possible future: prosecution,

On 6/11/62, the Pittsburgh Office ascertained that there
was considerable inductance and cross-talk on cable 56,
counts 341 through 50 as well as considerable AC voltage
running as high as two volts on count 348. CSPG 175-S
was contacted concerning this undesirable condition and
he immediately referred the matter to the Engineering
Department of the Bell Telephone Co. Due to the complexity :
of these existing conditions monitoring of the misur :
_and tesur operations was discontinued on 6/11/62 until
the lines can-.be cleared and balanced. The Pittsburgh ‘
Office has not, therefore, had the benefit of the knowledge

of the operations within the North Star Cement Block . \
Co. since the aforementioned date o's, :
