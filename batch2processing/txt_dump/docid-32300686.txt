Court, Pittsburgh, for giving false testimony at a
naturalization hearing in which he testified that a
fellow countryman from Greece. was deserving of citizenship
in the United States and had no prior convictions.

had several past arrests which were brought to light
and HAZIDAKIS was convicted and sentenced.to serve
several months in ‘the Westmoreland County Jail. T-1
pointed out that HAZIDAKIS has a wife and teen-age son
living in Athens, Greece, and that HAZIDAKIS has told

pack to the United States or sent someone over to Greece
to bring him back, T-1 said that HAZIDAKIS is actually
terrified.of KELLY MANNARINO and in his opinion only

stays in the United States for fear of winding up with.a
pullet in his head if he refuses to follow KELLY MANNARINO's
orders, According to°T-1, HAZIDAKIS. is also afraid‘ that
he is dying of cancer and has consulted many doctors and
visited severdl of the major medical clinics in the United
