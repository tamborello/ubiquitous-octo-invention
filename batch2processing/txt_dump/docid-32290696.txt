MM 105-4719

According to source, this set now installed :
in IRIGOYEN’s home, will be used to transmit messages
to Cuba and to communicate with a boat, possibly the
"Barcarolle," owned by the Montecristo Group and
docked at 8th Avenue N.W. near the bridge. wx) (u)

On October 9, 1961, MM T-4, who is personally
acquainted with CELSO LUIS PIMIENTA, advised he had
learned that the latter individual had said an anti-
CASTRO group called the 30th of November had purchased
an HT-4 radio transmitter and a BC-348 receiver from
Aircraft Radio Marine Company, located at Northwest
36th Street, Miami, Florida, for the sum of thirteen
hundred dollars. IMIENTA said this equipment was set
up for clandestise operation in the home of a woman
named LEONORMTALAVERA, located at_.1500_Northwest_25 25th |
Avenue, Miami,Florida. PIMIENTA said a woman was
going to operate the equipment; however, it was sub-
sequently learned that the woman was not qualified
to operate the equipment, and the idea was dropped.

PIMIENTA related that the 30th of November
group thereafter contacted PIMIENTA and asked him if
he would operate the equipment from the above described
residence. PIMIENTA said he told the group he did not
want to have anything to do with that equipment, but
1f anything, he would use his own personal transmitter.

PIMIENTA said:he thereafter took his trans-
mitter to the above described residence, but he never
made a contact with anyone in Cuba, or any other
country for that matter, and indicated he subsequently
took his radio equipment out of that residence.

PIMIENTA said he believed the 30th of November
group was bluffing, and contrary to their statements,
