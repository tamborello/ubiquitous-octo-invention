ue . ¢ ‘he
PCI and DONOHUE believed that through LAVERNEA DUFFY, USE
whom PCI described as an Assistant Attorney General,

they could make arrangements to Have MARCELLO furnish

to the Department of Justice witnesses against HOFFA

who would stand up in Court in return for which the
Government would give MARCELLO a clean bill on his
deportation proceedings. Informant and DONOHUE be-

lieved that they could make a sizable amount of. money
"legally" by setting up such arrangements with DONOHUE
makéng the Government contacts and PCI making the

MARCELLO contacts.

on 3/20/62, PCI telephonically contacted SAM MARCELLO
from Milwaukee to the Jefferson Music Company, Gretna,
La., in order to determine whether or not. SAM and his
family were still willing to pay for arrangements to
get the deportation proceedings killed. At this time
SAM told informant, "Don't spend a buck on it. Every-
thing is taken care of." Informant then contacted
DONOHUE by long distance telephone on 3/22/62 and.
advised him of this information, whereupon DONOHUE said
that it was still his best information that MARCELLO was
number 1 to be deported.

Of the two, informant is more inclined to believe

that MARCELLO knows what the actual facts are, and
informant further believes that because of his current
attitude as contrasted with his attitude of six months
ago, that the MARCELLOs have "spread the million
dollars around in high Government circles" whereby
MARCELLO need no longer worry about deportation.

PCI has advised that he has discussed MARCELLO's status
further, after these conversations, with FRANK PETER
BALISTRIERI, and the.latter has said that he will try
to find out MARCELLO's status. DONOHUE likewise will
keep PCI informed, and PCI has promised to keep this
office informed.

As indicated, Milwaukee is unable to evaluate the above
information for lack of knowledge as to MARCELLO's
current status.

PCI explained that the Government had for years been
endeavoring. to deport MARCELLO, who was born in
Tunisia, but because of MARCELLO's payoffs in Government
circles in Tunisia, Italy and France, none of those
countries would receive him. The current attempt was

to have a phony birth certificate prepared in the
Dominican Republic for MARCELLO and leak back information
whereby the Government of the U.S. could discover the
existence of this birth certificate and deport MARCELLO:
to the Dominican Republic rather than to a European or
an African country. TRUJILLO was to get $200,000 if
this plan went through, and PCI was to hold the money
in escrow for this purpose.

Before the plans could be completed for this, MARCELLO
was "grabbed and hustled to Guadamala by Army airplane"
and what his attorney described as a kidnaping by the
Government of the U.S. while his deportation case was
still under appeal.

PCI thereafter furnished through MARCELLO's brother,
SAM, two names of Guadamalan officials--one being the
head of the Guadamalan Air Force and the other being
an individual who at the present time is Guadamalan
representative to the United Nations, name unrecalled.

Within a very short time after this, PCI heard that
MARCELLO was back in the U.S., and as recently as six
months ago in talking to MARCELLO's brother, SAM, by
telephone, PCI learned that the MARCELLO family was
willing to spend a million dollars, if necessary, to
keep MARCELLO in the country so he could spend the
rest of his life with his family.

PCI had further discussions with DONOHUE relative to

this matter and learned that MARCELLO was Number 1 on
the list to be deported and that although the Attorney
General was personally very interested in getting
MARCELLO deported, this interest was second to his
interest in getting JAMES R. HOFFA in jail, which he has
been unable to accomplish for.lack of witnesses whdai will
stand up in Court. oS

\ RE: CARLOS MARCELLO

that a better evaluation can be made concerning the reported
friendship between these two individuals. You should recontact
| and attempt to obtain more specific information as to
the times, dates and places that the various incidents occurred,
which are described in your letter in order. that, effort can be
made to verify information furnished by him prior to dissemi-
nation of same.. You should obtain more details concerning the
identity of Donohue and Duffy and furnish same to Washington
Field in order that an effort can. be made to further identify
and develop information concerning these individuals. It is
noted there. is no one employed in the Department of Justice -

by the name of Laverne Duffy; however, one Lavern Duffy has
been. an investigator for the McClellan Committee,

New Orleans, ‘through established contacts in the
telephone company, should review appropriate records in an
effort to determine if the Marcello group has been in
telephonic contact with PcI L___] in Milwaukee. New Orleans
also advise of any information in its possession which may
be of significance to the information furnished by Milwaukee. .

After. receipt of desired data from Milwaukee, Washington
Field should discreetly handle logical investigations which would
assist. in verifying any allegations made by. PCIL

: This matter must be handled promptly and results
furnished to ‘the. Bureau.

Milwaukee and New Orleans should handle this matter
promptly and furnish results to Washington Field, in order
that logical investigation can be conducted by them.

NOTE continued:. deported from the United States. Marcello is a
notorious New Orleans hoodlum_o om four Federal indictments
are presently outstanding. — Claims he was placed in

with Marcello by Fra alistrieri, Milwaukee hoodlum.
— claims Marcello will give a million dollars to a

make arrangements for avoiding his deportation. ]
plans to make arrangements for same and act as a go-between wit
the Marcello group, while Donohue will act as a go-between with -
“high" Government officials. One of Donohue's reported contacts
is one Laverne Duffy, who informant described as an Assistant

Attorney General. There is no one in the Department by that name.

However, there is an individual by same name who in the past has
been an investigator with the McClellan Committee. One of the
schemes involved in this matter would be to arrange to have
Marcello make witnesses available in the Hoffa case, since the

Government is having considerable difficulty in developing witnesses

who can assist in the prosecution of him. After details were
worked out between — and Donohue, L____] contacted’ Sam
Marcello and was informed that there was_no need for further
action. "Everything is taken care of." believes the
Marcellos have already made arrangments to avo his deportation
by distributing the million dollars in high Government circles.
This airtel is being forwarded in an effort to prove or disprove
allegations made by] ;
