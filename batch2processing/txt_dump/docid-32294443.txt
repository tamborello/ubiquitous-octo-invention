that the voice on the both of these recordings sounded like
the anonymous caller who has previously contacted the
BENJOCHEA residence and he still believed that this is the
voice of JOSE RICARDO GARCIGA. BENJOCHEA, SR., who has never
talked to the extortionist by telephone, expressed the
opinion that the voice sounds like that of GARCIGA, whom he
has talked to in person.

On 1/22/65 the Miami Office sent to the FBI
Laboratory typewritten specimen obtained on 1/15/65 by
MM 635-S, who went to the Abbey Clinic to consult Dr. BOSCH
as a patient for a foot ailment. He observed BOSCH type
this specimen on ais old Underwood typewriter, A non-
professional comparison of this specimen with the extortion
letter which was sent to the home of MENDOZA reflects great
similarity, and it is hoped that this typewriter may be
identiéiéd as being the one used in the MENDOZA letter.

CONTEMPLATED INVESTIGATION

Miami will conduct investigation to identify the
anonymous caller and igsattempting to bring this case to another
“payoff. Miami will also attempt to catch subjects in the
act of making a telephone call to one of the victims, if
possible.

Efforts will continue to obtain specimens from
typewriters in possession of subjects and suspects. Voice
recordings obtained from IGLESIAS will be played back to
additional victims and witnesses for identification purposes.
