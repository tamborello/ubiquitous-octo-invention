regardless of individual circumstances, that Congress rejected in enacting the JFK
Act. :

Moreover, even if for some reason information about McCall might pose a
threat to HO 1125-C, there is no basis for redacting it here because the FBI has
already released the same information elsewhere. The Dallas Field Office copy of
the document in question contains a handwritten cross-reference to “serial 1343.”
This notation is not redacted. Serial 1343 of the same Dallas file,“* which in turn
refers back to the document at issue, contains the following unredacted notes:

Hostess: Batcher [sic] Club Dallas
Fixer
“Payoff Contact’
“No Accident’

Obviously, the other party to the phone conversation reported in the earlier
serial -- described therein as a “fixer” and “pay-off contact” with the Dallas police
and as the source of the story that Oswald’s death was “no accident” -- was the
hostess at the “Batcher Club” in Dallas.

Serial 1343 contains further handwritten information that has also been
released to the public: the name “Marianne McCloskey,” followed by an address
and phone number. Plainly, the writer of this notation had concluded, or at least
suspected, that Marianne McCloskey was the same person as HO 1125-C’s “Mary
Ann McCall.” A researcher working only with documents in which “Mary Ann
McCall” is redacted also could easily conclude that McCloskey was the source of the
“no accident” story. Serial 1343 sets out a “lead” for the Dallas FBI to interview the
woman who originated the story, and McCloskey is the only person whose name, .’
address, and phone number is written on the document.

This haphazard application of the FBI's "principle" of protecting informants is
by no means unique. The Review Board staff frequently has found duplicate

MAssassination Record Number 124-10075-10209, FBI File Number 44-1639-
1343 (attached at Exhibit 11). FBI file 44-1639 is the Dallas Field Office’s case file for
Ruby’s shooting of Oswald. (Redacted information highlighted in yellow and not
yet reviewed by the Review Board.)

Re: FBI Appeal of .JFK Assassination Records
Review Board Determination Concerning
Release of FBI Documents - August 8, 1995

Dear Mr. President:

After reviewing the Assassination Records Review
Board's reply to my August 8th request for postponement ‘of ©
disclosure of. certain portions of nine. FBI documents,’I believe

it necessary to offer the following additional comments for your
consideration. Lo

First, the Board's analysis regarding. disclosure: of the
information’‘which would reveal its source as the Swiss government
entirely misses the most salient point behind.this. portion of the
appeal: the Swiss have, upon being asked, flatly refused to
consent to its disclosure. That we may have disclosed some of
the information at issue in years past under different
circumstances does not now detract from the fact that the Swiss--

even when informed of the past disclosures--object strongly to
its release today. . .

: It is the current and future Yelationship between our
two countries, not that of the past, that we seek to protect by -
requesting postponement. The resolve shown by the Swiss coupled
with the views of the State Department outlined ‘in the enclosure

are, we believe, clear and convincing evidence that’ the Board's

decision will compromise the current understanding of
confidentiality that exists between our two countries. i

(a). Exhibits 1 and 2.° “C1 291-S,” “CI 300-8,” and “CI 104-S”are symbol
numbers for informants who provided information regarding thé actions of leaders
of the Communist Party-USA immediately before and after the assassination. They
also reported to the FBI on the reactions of these leaders to the assassination and to
contacts between their Party and the accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.

From the first of these documents (Exhibit 1), the FBI wishes to withhold the
symbol numbers and almost an entire page of the information the informants "
provided, while releasing two of the informants’ file numbers: 134-63A and 134-
229A. (The "134-" prefix designates a security informant file number.) Yet in the
second document (Exhibit 2), the FBI releases all of the information provided
therein, but withholds the same two informant file numbers released in the first
document. As discussed further below, these contradictory results reveal the FBI’s
inconsistent application of its "principle" of informant protection.

In support of these inconsistent redactions, the FBI provided the Review
Board with no document-specific evidence. The FBI did not provide the Review
Board with the identities or present locations of these informants, or even any
indication whether they are living or dead. In fact, the FBI provided no evidence
whatsoever about these informants. Instead, it chose to "justify" its position by
appealing to its institutional policies, and reiterating its contention, specifically
rejected by the JFK Act, that there is a current need to keep this information secret,
regardless of whether these informants are living or dead, active or inactive, safe or
at risk.

Given the FBI's refusal to provide any evidence -- even information readily
available in its own files for these informants -- regarding a current need to protect

interest in disclosure against whatever harm the FBI imagines. Even so, the Board
concluded that the public interest in “fully informing the American people about the
history surrounding the assassination" of President Kennedy (JFK Act, Section
3(10)), will be substantially served by releasing these assassination records in full.

(b). Exhibit 3.* “HO 1125-C” is a symbol number for a criminal informant
who provided, at the least, a tantalizing lead to the FBI. HO 1125-C, according to
the assassination records that the FBI wishes to keep redacted, spoke on the phone
with his (or her) long-time acquaintance, Mary Ann McCall, on November 25, 1963.
HO 1125-C reportedly knew McCall to be a“ ‘fixer’ and ‘pay-off contact’ between
Dallas police and criminal element.”” Their conversation turned to the events of
the previous day, when Jack Ruby had killed Lee Harvey Oswald while Oswald was
in police custody in the basement of the Dallas Police and Courts Building. McCall
repeatedly told informant HO 1125-C that Oswald's death was not an “accident,”
but refused to elaborate beyond saying, “You know how it works.” HO 1125-C was
to see McCall while on a business trip to Dallas, attempt to get more information
about Oswald’s murder, and report back to the FBI.

The FBI wishes to redact the symbol number HO 1125-C, as well as McCall’s
name and occupation as hostess at the “Bachelor’s Club” in Dallas -- all purportedly
in order to protect its confidential relationship with HO 1125-C. Yet it has provided:
no evidence whatsoever as to whether HO .1125-C, whoever he or she may have
been, may still require protection, or whether McCall still poses (or ever did pose) a
threat to an exposed HO 1125-C. As explained above, at least some information
relevant to these questions should be found in its own informant files for HO 1125-
C. But rather than, at a minimum, consulting its own files for this informant, the FBI
chose to rely on the assertions of a blanket need to protect every informant,

support of its redactions in this document, the FBI had kept secret this
: characterization of McCall -- ostensibly to protect its confidential relationship with
i HO 1125-C. ,
