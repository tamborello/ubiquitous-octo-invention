want another crisis with the Soviet Union so soon after the 1963
Cuban missile crisis.

After leaving government service in December 1968, I did not lose
my fervor in the fight against atheistic Marxist-Leninist communism.
I kept on speaking out against this menace. The following is a list of
lectures which I gave on various aspects of the communist threat:

September 9, 1968 - lecture at a meeting of the Arlington, *
Virginia Lions Club at the Washington Golf & Country
Chup. :

January 12, 1971 - lecture before the Rotary Clubot McLean,

Virginia,

November 7, 14, 21, 28, 1971-aseries of four lectures at the

Cherrydale United Methodist Church, Arlington, Virginia.

January 30, 19784. - lecture at a meeting of the Bethesda,
Chevy Chase Rotary Club at the Kenwood Country Club

in Bethesda, Maryland.

April 26, 1974 - lecture before the Methodist Men's Group of

espionage evidence was located in his rcom at the Hotel Latham.
When he was arrested he also reportedly indicated he wanted attorney
Abt. Colonel Abel was convicted of espionage and served his prison
sentence until 1962, when he was exchanged for U-2 pilot Francis
Gary Powers after long negotiations by attorney James “ Denovan,

When Oswald visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in 1963.
the man he went to see was the Soviet official in charge of issting
visas. This seemed quite reasonable as the excuse by’ Ogwald for
visiting the Embassy was to obtain a visa to visit Cuba. The iroriy of
this situation is that the Soviet official in charge of issuing visas was
also the KGB Soviet espigopnage agent reportedly connected with EGB
Department 13 activities, which included assassinations.

The third thing that intrigued me about the Oswald case was the

fact that.this young former U.S. Marine was able to bring his Russian

wife home from the Soviet Union when colonels and other American
businessmen were unable to bring their Russian wives home from the
Soviet Union. Why was Oswald allowed this special treatment?

The above information worried me and and when I got back to CIA
Headquarters, I prepared a memo for the CIA official who had been in
liaison with the Warren Commission. The "1970 Information Please
Almanac! states that on September 27, 1964, the President's
commission on the assassination of President Kennedy issued its
report (Warren Report} which concludes that Lee Harvy Oswald acted
alone in the assassination of President Kennedy. I believe the heads of
the FBI, CIA and President Johnson in the White House wanted the

Oswald case brought to a conclusion as fast as possible as they did not

Headquarters trying to find a spot to work after coming from abroad.
Contracts were not being renewed and it was with regret that I left the
CIA. -

My service in CIA was varied. In the Spring of 1965, I was sent to
Mexico City: my assignment to review all the files on Soviet Personnel
in Mexico which were located at the U.S . Embassy: I spent 30 days
determining from the known activities of each person as to what extent
he may have been engaged in espionage activities. From the
information gathered, it was possible to determine more than 50
percent were engaged in varying degrees of espionage activitv. When
l returned to CIA Headquarters in McLean, Virginia, I prepared an 85
pase monograph that was used as a training manual for CIA agents
assigned to Latin American countries in contact with Soviet
activities.

During the course of mv review of the files on Soviet personnel, I
ran across the following information that related to Lee Harvey
Oswald and the November 1963 assassination of President John F.
Kennedy! First I was somewhat startled to learn that when Oswald
was arrested in Dallas in November 1963, he was asked if he wanted
an attorney. Oswald reportedly replied, "Yes, I want attorney Abt." It

“turns out that Abt was the New York City attorney for the Soviet
Purchasing Commission and the Soviet Embassy. Colonel
Rudolf Abel, a suspected key Soviet KGB agent was arrested in New

During my 23 vears of service in the FBI, I received 17 letters of

Department of Justice Building, where the eight Nazi saboteurs were
tried, Director J. Edgar Hoover attended. I do not recall that Director

You asked me fo review an excerpt of a manuscript titled Communism: The 20th Century Red Plague, by
Herman O. Bly labelled as copyrighted, and determine whether it should be released to NARA for
inclusion in the collection of administrative files relating to JFK. These “administrative” files include

 

Kristi A. Kenniston documents such as this one, which might be considered substantive JFK records, discovered after the
Office: ClOLGL bulk of the JFK collection was constructed. After further discussion, | found that the document is atready
renee ree in NARA’s custody but not yet accessible to the public; the issue is whether to pull it out of the collection,
AS 03/19/03 10:10 AM authorize NARA to release it in full, or redact it in some fashion. Although ClO/Legal's preference is to
ms take it out of the collection, we understand the political difficulties in doing so (specifically an anticipated
ran baannaann . strong objection from NARA) and consequently endorse tedacting the document, as well as the attached

cover letter and statement of background information, in fuli for as tong as allowable under the JFK Act.

The draft was sent to the Agency in 1997; along with a statement of background information, with a cover
letter requesting review by the CIA Publications Review Board (PRB). None of these documents should
To: Mary V. Amoia-Y-@DO have been considered relevant to the JFK Act. The cover letter and statement of background information
ce. Lisa V, Studtmann@DA, Richard J. Puhl@D, D. Elizabeth Cross@DA, contain no information about JFK whatsoever. The draft itself, while it does include a small amount of
Allison K. Fong@DA . information on JFK, is not a Goverment record and is consequently not responsive to the Act.
Subject: Bly Manuscript in JFK Coection A PROouer PRIVILEGEO Manuscripts submitted for review to the PRB and housed in its fies. such as the draft at issue here,
INFORMATION/ATTORNE contain only non-official views, and are not used to further Government business. The information in this
manuscript is only the personal view of an ex-employee in his non-official capacity. The copyright label is
a further indication that this was at no time meant to be considered a Government record, but the personal
record of an author.

Nonetheless, because the documents have been released to NARA atready, the best solution is to
withhold them for as long as NARA will allow us to do so. Because the records will have been
accessioned to NARA by the time they will be released, NARA is the proper agency to address whether
the information is actually copyrighted, and how that impacts release to the public,

Please let me know if my factual understanding is incorrect, or if you have any questions.
