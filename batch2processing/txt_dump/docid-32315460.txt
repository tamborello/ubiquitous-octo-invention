CI said TONY GIACALONE has not lost face with any of the

top hoodlums because of his recent arrest. They feel that GIACALONE

was completely circumspect in his contacts because he névr. had a ;

face to face meeting with Sgt. THOMAS. In addition, they do not.

believe that the police have a strong enough case to obtain a con-

viction, CI said that without the testimony of CLAUDE WILLIAMS

the case against GIACALONE is weak, . He added that WILLIAMS "de-

cided to disappear even before GIACALONE was released on bond."

CI strongly implied that CLAUDE WILLIAMS has been killed. He did

not specifically say so but he said he sympathized with the fellows

who have the job of trying to locate WILLIAMS,

In discussing the GIACALONE case the CI stated that. the numbers

racket has been hard hit because of the investigations conducted

by the FBI and IRS, He mentioned that he has not yet received his
salary check for June, He volunteered that it is the "copper nut"
which is so extremely high. At the present time he does not make.
payments to any officers personally as he has done in the past. He
said he has refused to handle such payments at the present time.

He then explaind that he could not refuse pojnt blank but he had
presented persuasive arguments which relieved him of such duties.

@ stated he estimates the "copper nut" to be about $20,000.00 per
month at present. He also said that he has been very careful not
to be seen on the streets with persons like TONY GIACALONE. He
said he has had meetings with him but they are arranged in such a
way that no one would see them together, CI blamed the present
high payments to police for the state of revenue from the numbers. .
He said he believes that the top hoodlums will be eventually forced
to get out of the numbers racket, and said PETE LICAVOLI had con-
sidered several week ago discontinuing the Green Sheet altho at the
present time it is not handled directly by any Sicilians or Syrians,

CI also stated that he has been urged to develop Inspector .
O'Neil, He said he has discussed this matter with MOSSIE MASSU and
beth of them suspect that someone has gotten to. O'Neil before this
time because he dees appear to leave them alone and does not seem
to bother their activities. CI said he can't understand why he has
been asked to try to develop O'NEIL if he is already in someone's
pocket. He said he has no personal knowledge that O'NEIL has been
corrupted and added that both O'NEIL and his wife have separate in-
comes so may be satisfies with their incomes,

CI menthoned that "BREEZY" is a partner of MIKE RUBINO, He
is a downriver bookie. .
I-stated that TONY CIMINI is often with TONY GIACALONE. He
does not think that any particular person will replace TONY GIACA-
LONE as the top. man on the street. —
