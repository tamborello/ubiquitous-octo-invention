When New York's latest national summary report’ was received
at the Bureau and careful review commenced during mid-July, 1963, we
were aware that the Department had released voluminous data to the
"Saturday Evening Post" for preparation of a feature article on cap=
tioned organization. ‘Utmost caution was, therefore, necessary in
reviewing, this material to guard against compromising our top sources
in the criminal intelligence field. When an advanced draft of the
"Saturday Evening Post" article was received shortly thereafter, it
became increasingly apparent that the Department was making full dis-
closure of our information on this organization and that special pre- i
cautions would be necessary to protect our most sensitive sources j
from being pinpointed by Department release, :

 

We had only to reflect on the fact that one of our top
member-sources, Alfredo Sanantonio, had been murdered in gang style OTHER 4
in New York on July 11, 1963, a week or so before, to realize the
necessity of utmost caution. _

‘Inasmuch as New York's report contained specific data wnscn /
we had received in the : m a hewly developed member-~ 4
source in Los Angeles, | who is our most valuable
source in southern California, «it was necessary to delete certain
of his information and to reword other data furnished by him which,

  
 

if released, would tend to pinpoint him as the source.
EX 3 7 — COS¢L— FOS
Additionally, this report. contained Considerable Specific

detail regarding the Las Vegas skimming operation which, if released
by the Department, would seriously endanger our key sources covering
this operation, On this point we, of course, had.to take into consid-
eration that sensitive data on the skimming operation had previously
been leaked to the underworld shortly following dissemination of such
material to the Department. Therefore, it was necessary that consid-
erable material’ in this report concerning skimming be amended and
expressed in more general terms to avoid Pinpainting.ournckey sources,

and amended pages have been in rted: in our copies of this report,
