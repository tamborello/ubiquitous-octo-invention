SF T-1 advised on June 23, 1964, that he had
received, information through ALEX CAMARATA, Martinez, L
California, son-in-law of JOHN MISURACA of Irvington, to
New Jersey, that MISURACA is one of the important leaders ce
in the PROFACI family of. New York City. MISURACA indicated
in a letter to the CAMARATA'S that there would be more
"heads roll" in the organization in the future. CAMARATA
was unable to furnish any further details or to explain what
was meant by MISURACA's remark.

 

SF T-1 advised on December 10, 1963, that in a tl
recent conversation with ALEX CAMARATA, member of La Cosa .
Nostra of Martinez, California, CAMARATA recalled their ;
having a meeting at San Jose, California, over two years
ago in which THOMAS NICOSIA was relieved of his position
as secretary of the La Cosa Nostra due to ill health and
was replaced by STEFANO ZOCCOLI. MANNY FIGLIA, "Capo", +
at San Jose, California, argued at this meeting that his
father, VINCENZO FIGLIA, deceased, should be made secretary.
Those in attendance at this meeting reportedly had a heated
argument over this matter which ultimately resulted in:
3 ZOCCOLI being made secretary. Informant further recalled
h ; that the office of secretary prior to NICOSIA was held by
ANTHONY SCAVUZZO, an elderly member of La Cosa Nostra of
: San. Jose. Informant was not able to attend this meeting
t due to his employment.

 

‘ SF T-1 advised on December 19, 1963, that plans

i had been made.for ALEX CAMARATA, SALVATORE COSTANZA, both

: of Martinez, and ANGELO GIAMMONA of Modesto, California,
to meet at the Used Car Lot of EMANUEL FIGLIA, "Capo", in
San Jose on December 21, 1963, at which time they were to

i go to the California: Cheese Company for a get-together

‘ of La Cosa Nostra members. Informant subsequently reported
this propdsed gathering had been canceled possibly due to
the close scrutiny being given members of La Cosa Nostra
by various Federal agencies.

! SF T-6 advised on March 13, 1964, that STEVE
: ZOCCOLI, council member of La Cosa Nostra of San Jose,

: met with JAMES LANZA, "Don" of San Francisco in the office
of the latter, They discussed the fact that ANGELO MARINO,
"Capo" of the organization in San Jose had been interviewed
by the FBI. LANZA indicated—there is nothing going on in
this area,and.MARINO should have told the agent that his
factawere a bunch of lies. Both agreed they did not think
