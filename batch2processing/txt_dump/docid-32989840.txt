In regard to your Tetter of December 16, 1977,

of those dates.

Should you be able to inform us of a permanent date

and time with a minimum of four weeks‘ notice, we would be
delighted to attend and testify as to the FBI
Federal enforcemerit area within the State of Mississippi.

Sincerely,

Patrick W. Murray
Acting Special
