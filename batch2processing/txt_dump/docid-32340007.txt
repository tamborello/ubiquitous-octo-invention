On September 15, 1958, PCI Arthur. Newman (conceal), Credit

at the Nacional might be sold to MIKEZMc LANEY of Miami. -loNewman not
! _that while the deal was not final, ‘it was practically réady for signing.
( Source said if the deal goes through, the manager of the casino will
probably be an individual named SCHWARTZ, who formerly ran_a clandestine
gambling operation in Atlantic City, New. Jersey. ~"gource noted that hype
SCHWARTZ Had this gambling operation on an "off and on" basis in Cael —_
Atlantic City for about 20 years. Source stated that SCHWARTZ' |
place was ‘knocked over" by New Jersey State Police this past summer
and that the business had closed.
