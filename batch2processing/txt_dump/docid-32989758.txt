4) Was the investigation conducted with due regard for the

In order to answer these and other significant issues, the
Committee directed staff to undertake, as its first step, a

thorough review of pertinent investigative files from both the

(the official designation of the FBI's assassination investi-
gation was "MURKIN"); the Memphis FBI Field Office MURKIN File,
(Memphis was "office of origin" on the investigation"); and major
field office reports from sixteen separate FBI districts, including
the key cities of Atlanta, Birmingham, New Orleans, St. Louis,

INTRODUCTION: THE ISSUES AND THE APPROACH

Because of thé extensive effort made by the FBI in both
the security (COMINFIL) investigations and the COINTELPRO
operations carried out against Dr. King and the SCLC during
the 1960's, the House Select Committee on Assassiratioris was
faced with the troubling: question of whether that same agency
was either- willing or able. to conduct a thorough and far
reaching criminal investigation of the assassination itself.
Stated otherwise, could the FBI abandon the adversary posture
it had-assumed’ toward Dr. King, and’ carry out an objective
and agressive investigation of the person(s) responsible for

the murder?:

Beyond this overriding issue, the: Committee's review
of the -federal, assassination: investigation involved a number -

of additional important inquiries:

1) Did-the Justice Department, / properly exercise its

__ supervisory: authority over*the direction and ‘conduct of the

investigation? ©

2) Were all available: investigative resources committed to
the task of identifying and locating the person(s) responsible

for: Dr. King's death?
