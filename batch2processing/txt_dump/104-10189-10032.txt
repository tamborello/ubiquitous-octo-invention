‘The initial effort (about {eezingt the PUEUMEN, TPELIDE
terget wae @ PBIMPULSF (hot-:nihke telephone). It was
fatroduced into the target ueiag LIFEAT asseto and waa actuated
from the LIFEAT VI baechoure.

 

 

Subsequent to that (1960-1961), eight micropphoe/tracemitter
inatallations were made in the same target. These werw
called LIERODE installations, Cne or two were placed in the
senior official's office at various times during thie period.
These installations were monitored from a truck (not the LIFIRE
truck) mad an apartment (bavchouse Abie) and later & second,

cloeer apartment (baschouse Baker).

Basehouse Baker was always referred to ae the LIERODE
Base. . :

The laet micrepbone/transmitter installation ceased functioning
@uring tate 19619 and at that time work started on a sew
imstallation called LIFRODE/MKIRAP because the MKTRAP

technique was used.

The LIERODE/MKTRAP jestailation wae made vaing
LUPEAT aseeta and waa actuated from the LIFEAT-VI Sase

ésring March 1962.

At some time during the partod 1962-1963 photo operations
were put into effect using Basehouse Bakar (LIESODE Base).

During Nowember 1963, the LIERODE/MK TRAP inotallatioa
was re-actuated from a second LIFEAT Basehouse (Basehouse

Charlis).

In summary, vince there have been the following
technical operations from the foliowiag bases againat this
target
1. PBIMPULSE (hot-mike telephone) LIFEAT-VI
2. Mike/tranemitter installations (6 each) asenouse A & Blinwa)

3.- MKTRAP (hot-mike telephone) LIFEAT- VI and
