MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel

ATTENTION : Mr. Gary Breneman
VIA + SA/ADDO
SUBJECT : William J. Johnson, dr.

1. A thorough search of WHD, ISG and Station WH/Miami
indices has failed to turn up information on any connection
of Mr. Johnson with any Agency sponsored activity now and in
the past. The Office of Security advises that they have no
record of Subject. The indices checks did reveal that Subject
has been involved in anti-Castro activities since the early
1960's with Frank Anthony STURGIS aka Frank FIORINI.

2. In short, there is no record that William J. Johnson,dr.

has ever been employed by or officially connected with the Central
Intelligence Agency in any capacity whatsoever.
