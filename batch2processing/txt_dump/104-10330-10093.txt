Re: Submission of C1A’s Initial Statement of Compliance Under the JFK
Assassination Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107

Dear Barry:

In connection with the work of the CIA to locate and release records relating to
President Kennedy’s assassination pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (“JFK Act”), please submit to the Review
Board the CIA’s initial formal report regarding its work.

As you know, the procedures for documenting the CLA’s compliance with the JFK Act

_were set forth in the Review Board’s November 27, 1996 letter to the CIA Director.

These procedures entailed the submission of an intial report by the CIA, which we
referred to as an Initial Statement of Compliance. This past Spring, we informally
agreed to extend the time for submission of the Initial Compliance Statement pending
ongoing work of the CIA under the JFK Act.

To facilitate the completion of the CIA’s work by September 1998, including the
submission to Congress of a final report detailing the work accomplished by the CIA
and other Federal agencies under the JFK Act, please submit the CIA’s Initial
Compliance Statement to the Review Board no later than November 6, 1997.
