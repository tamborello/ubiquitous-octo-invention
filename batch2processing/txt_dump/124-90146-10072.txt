The "New York Times" on 3/24/61, in an article entitled

"US Asks Court Bar Questions On Castro Foes in Miami Area", by Peter
Kihss, reported that an unidentiffed US agency had intervened in a
murder trial in Miami asking: that questions about activities by Cubans
in that area seeking the overthrow of Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba be
barred in the trial. The article stated that the above intervention
became known while the FPCC called for a Congressional investigation of
CIA. Richard Gibson, acting national secretary of the FPCC, said he
based his call on an announcement of a "Revolutionary Council" set up
by the two major anti-Castro groups in Miami. Gibson said there had
been reports of CIA support; of an anti-Castro enterprise and that forces
had been using Florida as a training and staging point for attacks

+ against Cuba. He said that reckless.CIA action could lead the country

oS The following information was furnished by a
confidential source abread on February 4, 1972

According to the source, a pro-Palestinian erganization | °
called the Palestine Committee-Brussels was organized during ft
1970 within the Belgian National Palestine Committee for the hy
; purpose of supporting Palestinian revolutionary activities. ©), -

a
If

 

i The Brussels Committee was headed by Lue Bupire, a Belgian
national born on April ®, 1642, at Haine St. Paul, and the
National Palestine Committee by Aron Raindorf, a Belgian citigen \-
born on December 22, 1919, at St. Gilles,

Following a period during which the two. groups “
werked in. harmony, a schism took place in November, 1871, which,
resulted in a new group being formed by Dupire and Yvonne Sterck
which was called The Responsible Group for the National
Palestinian Committee and the Palestinian Committee-Brussels

7" ~ Without other members of either group being consulted. Raindor?, |
*; ,.aceerding to the source, is currently attempting to regain H
- @ontrol over divergent elements and te restore erder te the. Y
. groups involved. _*

 

In this connection, Rainderf traveled to London where
,he remained from Detembor 26 through December 28, 1971, and
jmet with one Gibson, described only as an American Negro journalist
j and with an individual imown as Manchanda,. described as being ~
! of Pakistani origin. The source indicated Manchanda is probably G&
identical to Albert Manchanda, a British citizen born on

April 9, 1919, in India. Raindorf also traveled to Beirut,
Lebanon, on January 20, 1872, and to Damascus, Syria; to meet :
with elements of the Fath and the ©.L.P.. which were not. further '
described by the BOUrLe .
