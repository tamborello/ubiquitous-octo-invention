The entry records were checked as of 4/17/67, with
no record found of the entry into Mexico of the 1958 cadiliac. (Gy)

General GONZALEZ. gave orders that he is personally
interested in this case and gave orders to report to him
personally night or day if this 1958 Cadillae with Florida
license plates appears. He said that he would "take the
Cadillac apart" looking for secret compartments and might
detain the occupants pending an investigation. He advised
that the only "probable cause" needed by him is his own

oe pleasure in the matter. General GONZALEZ was advised that
the FBI was not making any request that the car and occupants
be detained and that it was a Mexican matter within the
General's jurisdiction and that we had no suggestions to make
as to how he should handle such problems. ($} :
