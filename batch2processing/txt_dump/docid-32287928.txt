The New Garden Club continues to operate gambling
games at Gretna, La., and NO 1205-C reported that 21 tables
have operated in many of the clubs throughout Jefferson
Parish. NO 1205-C advised that an individual recently
attempted to operate a roulette game at the Cotton Club on
Jefferson Highway, and after one day's operation it was
closed by Major EARL ROLLING of the Jefferson Parish SO.

The next day Capt. SAM LE BLANC, Jefferson Parish SO,
rechecked to be sure that the club had closed down.

NO 1205-C advised the only explanation he can offer is that
the son of the owner of the Cotton Club was actively backing
another candidate in the first Democratic primary, and the
club was closed by Sheriff FITZGERALD because of this reason.

Sheriff JOHN JACK FITZGERALD was defeated in his
effort to be re-elected as sheriff in the first Democratic
primary, however, he will hold office until the first week
in May, 1964. Capt. CY DI LIBERTO on 1/8/64 advised that
it is a well-regarded fact that either of the two candidates
in the second primary will probably dismiss most of the
current employees of the Jefferson Parish SO, and he antici-
pates that most of the current deputies of the Jefferson
Parish staff will be hunting jobs between now and the first
week in May. DI LIBERTO indicated that Sheriff JOHN JACK
FITZGERALD has disregarded the operation of the Jefferson
Parish SO and for the time being the office is "running

 

itself".
