more explicit Information from MORA. The matter was discusse
again with the informants on 5/5/64, at which time they advised
that, according to MORA, she and CAMACHO are long-time friends
dating back to the time they were both residents of New York
City. The informants advised that MORA and CAMACHO correspond
frequently with MORA writing to CAMACHO approximately twice a
week and sending her toilet articles, warm socks, and similar
items which CAMACHO has needed while in Russia. They stated,
however, that MORA has ignored all opportunities persistently
created by the informants to say anything more about what
CAMACHO may have written her at one time or another regarding’

. that time and thereafter they have not been able to develop
any additional details and MORA has: not revealed any additional

information. SE AI” GY (

The Mexico City Office appreciates the Bureau's

; position that this matter must be pursued in depth and that the
informants should be made aware of the fact that the questions
raised by MORA‘s original information cannot be left unanswered.
The informants have been impressed repeatedly with. the need to
follow this case aggressively with MORA and to clarify. the :
original information. They repeatedly have created situations
which would open up a discussion of the previous information,
but have béen met with an apparent total lack of interest on
MORA's part, On 5/5/64 the informants pointed out that,
subsequent to MORA's original indication of interest. in. preés
reports concerning the OSWALD case pher, had. repeatedly called
her attention to various articles appearing in the press, .
including an article in "Life" magazine, but received no: x7
reaction whatsoever and no indication. of interest. — 7 WY)

~ Under instructions from this office the informants
have tried continuously to set up a two or threé-day trip :out
of Mexico City with MORA and her husband, FRANCISCO MORA.
Definite arrangements were made on three different. occasions '
for the proposed trip, and on each occasion MORA was enthusiastic
about it, desiring to get. away from the family and other problems
for a few days’ rest and relaxation. .On each occasion, however,
she postponed the trip due to financial - problems with the house
she and her husband are constructing, ill health of her mother,
or pressure of developments such as important visitors arriving
in Mexico whom she had to attend. The informants made a final,
effort to set up.a meeting wit ORA following the week end of -
5/9-10/64 and prior tobinex-19" eparture for the United State BY)
on 5/18/64, but. MORA again claimed that as much as she wanted
to take the trip, and muéh as she needed the rest she would not
be able to leave Mexico. City ‘because of the projects she had
pending. It does not appear that it wi be pogagible to set up
such a meeting in the’ future in view. of iex-18's feturn to the u)

United States.
Both “‘inforriants. have expressed the belief that further
efforts. to obtain more specific data from MORA on this matter
would be “working a dry well." On 5/5/64 they advised that in
their opinion MORA"s complete loss of interest in the OSWALD
case indicates that she has now decided that she and her
. associates were not actually involved with him. She, therefore,
! does not diseuss the matter any more aside from speculative | )
