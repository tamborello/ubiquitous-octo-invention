A. This is the decision they must face.

But it is equally important to know what
the Isracli position will be. Why should
the PLO take such a step unilaterally?

of-the relationship with our American
friends. We identified with principles
your forefathers held dear. We built
of mutual
respect, confidence and faith, and be-
yond that anything 1 did 10 cement
relations with the U.S. was based on-a
deep conviction about our common ob-
jectives—stability, peace and progress
in.the Middle East.

My duty is to develop my country, its
human resources, armed forces and sect-
rity and iittelligenc s to face the
tremendous threats that lie ahead. The
road is strewn with mines to sabotage the
peace process. One has just exploded in
Washington. There will be others. But
bear in mind that Jordan is not unique in
receiving such help. Israel falls into the

you choose to denude a vital arm that is
there to protect you, that is vour affair,
not Jordan’s.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Officer to the DDA

FROM : M. L.. Latta.
Deputy Chief, Plans and Review Group
Central Cover Staff

SUBJECT : Fairways Corporation

. 1. Per our telephone conversation ‘today, attorneys
for Victor Marchetti have requested release of the 168
‘items previously deleted by court order from the book,
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence. Fairways Corpora-
tion was referred to CCS by the SA/DO/O for review in .
this connection.

2. Fairways Corporation is the subject of four items
(107, 128, 129, 279, on pages 123, 132, 133, -and 403 respec-
tively,) in the original manuscript. The position of CCS on
all four items is that they are still classified, since they
describe intelligence sources and methods by identifying an
operational support facility located in the U.S., and are
therefore exempt from declassification under Section 5(B) (2)
of the General Declassification Schedule contained in Executive
Order 11652.

3. According to CCS files, in April 1975 Director Colby
was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways in connection with a planned TV documentary on Agency
proprietaries. CCS files are unclear on the point, but there
are indications that Director Colby may have responded to
the question in a manner which could have been construed as
admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways. In any case, CCS
files contain other evidence that the matter was considered
to be still classified as recently as December 1976, when
Director Bush wrote to the Administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration regarding CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways and asked that the subject be withheld from public
disclosure.

Hussein on

Following the disclosure that Jordan’s .

King Hussein had for years taken seeret
payments from the CIA, NEWSWHEK’S
Arnaud de Borchgrave
last week for an exclusive interview with
the King. The result was what Tu

called “my first and very last words?”
The Washington Post's rcuvlation of the
payments and their possible impact on
chances for peace in te Middle Bast.
Some excerpts: :

 

 

 

 

 
  

DE BORCHGRAVE: How much truth is
there in.the story that appeared in The Wash-
ington Post? ‘

HUSSEIN: The whole thing is ridicu-
Jons and insulting, But Lam prepared to
answer questions about it. :

Q. Your government spokesman said.the

story was a combination of “fabrication and
distortion.” What has been fabricated’ and
what has been distorted? :

A. What was fabricated in the story was
everything about funds hancled over. per-
sonally for private benefit. When friend-
‘ly Arab, countries extend and, ithas been

 

 

traditional for the checks to be made out’

to, the Head of State, which then are
deposited ‘in the state budget accorint.
This is nel an uncommon. practice. ATL
sistance received by us is handled in
the same w What is true is that fora
number of years, we have been offered
security and intelligence ance,
which the government of Jordan acce]
ed gratefully.

  

     

 

 

 

 

As for the story that the CIA paid for,

the protection of my children at schaol
in America. my request was made to the
State Department which kindly agreed
to ensure their security. Remember that
there have been many extremist plots
against me and my family and this was a
perfectly normal request. If Amy Carter
decided to come to school in’ Jordan
we would, needless to say, be responsi-
ble for her sectrity and would not be
sending a bill to the U.S. Government
for an elementary courtesy and ‘security
measure.

 

 

 

 

 

Q. How do you feel about President Carter
ordering the arrangement—code-named "No |
Beef"—stopped? . :

A. We had, T promise you, never he
anything about all this before. If the
reference is to the a wice we have
been receiving for security and intell-
gence, then TP have not been advised
about its suspension, either officially or
unofficially.

 

  

 

: Q. The intelligence Oversight Board set up
in February 1976 reported to President Forda

few months fater that they regarded the pay- -

nents as improper and he did nothing about

't. What do you feel was improper about those
aayments?

. A What is a proper way lo support a
friend and ally is strictly your business.

SUBJECT — : The CIA and -the Cult of Intelligence
by Victor Marchetti and John Dv Marks

 

1. Subject book was published in 1974 with 168
deleted items demanded by CIA and involved court
trial and decision. The lawyer for the authors has,
in effect, requested that a review be made of the
168 deleted items to determine which can now be
declassified and removed from the court's injunction,
particularly in view of the official disclosures
since the publication of the book. The Department of
Justice has advised that such a review is in order.

2. Since. the courts decided the 168 deleted
items were properly classifiable and classified in
accordance with the appropriate Executive Order in
effect at the time of the initial classification,
including Executive Order 11652, the review at this
time must include two points:

(a) Is the item still classified under
Executive Order 11652,

(b) Has the item been placed in the public
domain by official disclosure by the United
States, such as by an official in the Executive
Branch authorized to declassify the item, or by
a report of a Congressional committee, or by
the courts.

3. Each addressee is requested to appoint a
focal point officer to review each component's
respective items which are held by this office.

This office also has the DDO documentation submitted
in support of deleting each item in 1973. These can
be reviewed by each focal point official as necessary.

may have been cleared or released by CIA when
reviewing manuscripts submitted by other authors
since the publication of the Marchetti book. A

government for their review.
