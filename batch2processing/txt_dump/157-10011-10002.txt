MONGOOSE,/

Fitzgerald states it is too soon actually to state definitely :
what the effect of this policy (i.e. stopping raids) will have on our recruit-
ment program. The Agency's problem is not the number of recruits, but their
‘ quality. The unemployed, poorly educated, hungry are always with us. Some of
the more discerning Cuban types will avoid recruitment as they are convinced

 

that a priciplé reason for the U-7S:-action is to control who fights Castro in
order to insure who will succeed him.

OCCURRENCE?

Fitzgerald states Another advantage arising from the scrutiny

of U.S. agents will be the improvement and control and better clandestine
security practices on the part of the exiles. But as the U.S. restricts and
apprehends these men, confiscating goods and funds, the loci power will have

a tendency to move back to its traditional center: the exile--monied interests
such as the bosches, prlos and Batistas.

OCCURRENCE:

Fitzgerald states "The activist Cuban exiles will probably not be
deterred by the order (to stop hit and run raids). They may even profit by

the decree. It will now be a greater honor to engage in operations against
Fidel. The double jeopardy arising from the threat of detention by U.S. agents
and the chance for martyrdom at the hands of Fidel will be an even greater

 

 

challlenge.” Actually the supply of recruits for such hit and ron raids may

OCCURRENCE:

“~—~Lansdale states, "On October 30-31 for an 'Eyes Only’ back-
ground memorandum requested by Rosg¢gwell Gilpatric, information was requested
from CIA on the current status of all operations. CIA reported all militant
operations have been ordered held at a stop, although the volatile Cubans
‘were frustrated and not under complete control. The Matahambre operation
was not mentioned by the CIA in reporting in operational teams inside Cuba,

 

 

 

although I asked for specifics on -mititant_teams—insides—tTwo-action—teams :
CIA reported as being inside Cuba were described as in place only collecting
intelligence, not actions, (sabotage,etc.)*
