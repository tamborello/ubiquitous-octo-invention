Subject: Meeting with JUAN ESTEVEZ and JORGE BERUPF, 10/13/60
Cubans said Ray's group will not lower themselves to answer "Fidelismo

Review of Manuel Ray y Rivero Files, Volumes I - VIII

March 29, 1978
Volume I Undated to September 1960

I. cable Suggests that an offer of financial assistance to Ray's wife
and children from CIA rather than through the FRD may pay large future
dividends. Family to arrive circa September 1960.

2. Cable to Director .
From: MASH
19 September 1960

Increasing suspicion RAUL CHIBAS a Castro plant. Since exfiltration by
KAPPES, CHIBAS has laid low but back in picture as representative of RAY.
Common knowledge that CHIBAS brought KAPPES out of Cuba, but should be
noted that KAPPES has since been in and out of Cuba three times with

no apparent difficulties.

CHIBAS' sources of information:
Mason in U. S. government
Manuel de Jesus and Bender as FRD representatives
Nino Diaz as Alianza representative
Don Hogan Kappes as Alberto Fernandex representative.

This should get a good picture of the U.S. anti-Castro activities.

3. Summer 1960. Ray very actively recruited to become FRD member.

+-CIA considered him an important political asset. RAUL CHIBAS, Ray's

assistant, spoke for him with U.S. authorities. Urged strong organization
inside Cuba before outside help could be effective. CHIBAS meets with
Bender 9/7/60, says he is in favor of FRD but completely committed to

Ray and would check with him.

4, 27 September 1960.
Memo to Western Hemisphere/4 chief
From: Rudolph E. Gomez, Acting Chief, WH .
Subject; Approval from State to Include Manuel Ray Rivero in the
FRD Complex

At a 20 September 1960 meeting, Ray's name was suggested for inclusion
in FRD and State desired to look further into his background. Ray was
discussed again on 9/27/60 with Mr. Divine who further conferred with
Ambassador Mallory same day and Mallory approved Ray's inclusion.

5- September 29, 1960 cable from MASH to WHS indicates MASH somewhat
doubtful about Ray's feelings toward U.S. and continued dealings with
this group needs further policy consideration.

Subject: Alleged "New York Times" Publicity Build-up for Manolo Ray

Hal Hendrix, Scripps-Howard L.A. correspondent believes WY Times publicity

buildup for Ray in full swing. Tad Szule reporting Ray's war movements from

Miami. Also with Szule is close friend, Henry Raymont of the Times.

Yendrix said Times playing up Ray while downplaying Artime and Gutierrez
Menoyo. Think's Times exaggerating Ray's plans to take teams of highly
trained guerrillas into Cuba, and that Ray's "yar" is little more than an
MGM-type New York Times production so far.

A friend of his reports plans to assassinate top Castro leadership in Cuda.
To be done by poison -- "Clostridium Rotulinum"” which is strong, odorless,

corruption. Since Castro's victory at Bay of Pigs, his popular support is
