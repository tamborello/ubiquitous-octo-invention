NOTE FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM: Jeffrey H..Smith
General Counsel

SUBJECT: Response to Senator Specter's Request Concerning
Information to be Released Under the JFK Act

1. You asked me to obtain information to assist you in
responding to the questions from Senator Specter. Senator
Spector asked whether there was any information or documents to
be released by CIA under the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (JFK Act):

a. concerning Oswald's connection(s) to foreign powers
not previously disclosed; and

b. concerning Oswald's connection(s) to foreign powers
that CIA did not give to the Warren Commission.

2. My staff has checked with the Historical Review Group
(HRG), which is the component of the Center for the Study of ©
Intelligence that is processing the JFK collection under the JFK -
Act, regarding these two questions. Here is their response.

a. Response to Question 1: There is no information
to be disclosed that links Oswald to any foreign powers
other than those previously released (Cuba, USSR). However,
there will be additional details made public about these
contacts. For instance, the Russian intelligence officer
who met with Oswald in Mexico City has written a book that
has information not previously known to CIA. Also, under
the progressive declassification standards of the JFK Act,
many details on Oswald's activities have been declassified
and released (and the JFK Board may release more).

b. Response to Question 2: The HRG is unaware that
any of this information was not previously shared with the
Warren Commission. However, it is possible that there may
be some additional details or some specific documents that
the Warren Commission did not have. (FYI, The House Select
Committee on Assassinations' report indicated that the
information CIA had not shared with the Warren Commission
related to assassination plots against Castro, not to
Oswald's activities.) -

SUBJECT: Response to Senator Specter's Request Concerning

Information to be Released Under the JFK Act

3. In order to identify with precision any new details or
documents that may be released as a result of. the JFK Act, the
HRG would have to review the Warren Commission Report, then
compare the specific documents provided to the Warren Commission
with the documents in the collection to see if there is any
difference. Such a review and comparison would require the HRG
to dedicate a couple of reviewers to the task for a significant
period of time and inhibits its ability to complete the
processing required by the JFK Act.
