1. Forwarded under separate cover as Attachment A are two LIENVOY
transcripts of 12 November 1963 and two LIFNVOY + sranseripts of 123. Moves
1963 which Headquarters may consider for transmittal ta Stathior

 

e®, Wovrwarded under separate cover as Attachment Bis a photos:raph of
an unidentified male (who was accompanied by an unidenlified femole whose
photograph the Station asset did not obtain) who visited the Goviet Mmbas sy
at 100 hours on 12 November 1963. The Station believes this wale is iden-
tical with Subject since the male in the photograph is the only unidentified
male who was also accompanied by a woman ani, secondly, this male appears
to. be a nordic type. The Station recognizes, however, that Subject may havc
only claimed to he a Swede for cover purposes.

3. The following is the comment made hy Douglas J, FRINGLASS, the
Station's LIEWVOY translator, concerning Attachment A:

"The exact spelling of this neme could not be determined,
started by saying that it is - VW - A - H.. and then stopped, om
the two dots above A, It is very strange that he, being a Gwe
seck the aid of his Swedish Consulate, but applied to the Sov
bassy ond asked for a man, whom he mes by chanez (7) in © restuarant.

_ Mat stranger still is the response of the Embassy officials, who wen.
out of their way to find a ship for him, Usually requesis of chis
nature are brushed aside and quite offen in a very rude iaanner, dJnagis
from his non-British accent and almost flawless English, be m: have
lived in she United States or Canada for quite some time." (Tne Staion
REDMOON officer agrees with FEINGLASS' comncnt regarding the wal re-

— luctance of Soviet Embassy officials to lelp in a maiter of this type.)
Station Mexico has no record of any member of the Soviet NM cbassy

travelling to Oaxaca during this period.
