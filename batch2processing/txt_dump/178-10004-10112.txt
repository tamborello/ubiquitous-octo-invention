1 from the Agency because of his involvement in the assassination

 

 

  

 

2 plans ‘against Prime Minister Castro.

3 ” The facts are-that in June 1963 he was assigned

4 chiet 92 SE. and in February of '67 he was ..- 74:

5 reassigned to CIA Headquarters. He retired voluntarily under

6. our retirement system on 31 of December 1967. |

9 If I may, there is a reason why he was taken out and if I
| 8 could go off the record and mention that to the Committee. It

9 is a matter of his privacy.

10 Chairman Church. Very well, off the record.

1h (Off the record discussion)

12 ' Mx. Colby. - Back on the record.

13 Senator Schweiker .asked me whether Howard Hunt or James

14 McCord were in charge of Mexican overations at the time of

15 Président Kennedy's assassination on 22nd of November '63.

16 - Howard Hunt from “July ‘62 to August '64 was assigned as a

17 Section Chief in the Division of Plans Directorate, which is

18 now the Operations Directorate at CIA Headquarters, which had

no responsibility whatsoever for Mexican operations.

 

19
20 Senator Schweiker. What were those dates again?
21 Mr. Colby. July '62 to August '64.
22 Senator Schweiker. Wasn't he at some point in Mexico
23 city and in charge of that 0 office?
24 Mr. Knoche. Way back in the '50's he served in Mexico
‘City. Way back. He was not in-charge.

Affairs.

 

 

Mr. COLDy. ne was G Case oltticer then.

Senator Schweiker. So that is the period you are Saying
he had no jurisdiction in any way with Latin America or Mexicar.
oe
Mr. Colby. No, he was in what we call, and we have since

changed the name, to Domestic Operations Division at that time,

ur operations here in this country, and that is a whole

°

different subject I would have to explain some day.

Mr. McCord from June '62 to June '64 was assigned as a

  

CIA Security Officer in ¥
and he had no responsibilitics for Mexican operations at that
point.

Senator Morgan last time asked what information was given

to the Warren Commission concerning Agency assassination plans

concerning Castro, and I have been advised our records do not

_ indicate that the Warren Commission was provided with inforna-|

tion on this subject.

Allen Dulles, of course, I would nots, who was the CIA
pirsctoz until the fall of ‘61, was a member of the Warren
commission, but beyond thet fact I have nothing I could offer.

And then who made the decision not to provide it, if none
was given? ‘our records do not indicate that there was a CIA
decision on this matter not to tell the Warren Commission.

I could add that I believe the relationship with the
Wariten Commission was handled by one cf our St ASTOR

But I did want to clarify that. I think ‘I mentioned it
last time that there have been occasions on which this was i
done.

Chairman Church. Mr. Colby, would you in connection with
your review of this matter supply the Committee with the sve-
cifics in those cases where the Agency has in fact engaged
private investigators to do Agency work?

Mr. Colby. “I will certainly try to, Mr. Chairman. f
confess this may be a tough job to locate every case but I
certainly will do my best.

Chairman Church. wild You provide the Committee with the
opinion of your ‘Counsel with respect to the legality of such?

Mr. Colby. I will.

Chairman Church. Such use of private investigators?

Mr. Colby. Yes.

Chairman Church. And then I would ask the staff also
furnish the Committee with a brief on that guestion so that we
are-fully advised with respect to the law.

Mr. Colby. Right.

The second subject, Mr. Chairman. Senator Nondale asked
for our command and control regulations for the approval of ©
covert action projects. These were supplied to the staff on
the first of May and are available to the staff.

Thirdly, £1 was asked .if Mr. -Willian Harvey was removed

5 Nr. Colby. I have an answer to a few of the questions
6. that were raised at the meeting the other day and there are a
9 couple of clarifications I would like to make.

8 One, with' respect to the security investigations in the
9 United States. The question Was asked whether we ever used
10 private investigators, and I said we normally used our’ own
LL : investigators. We have some relationships with private

12 investigatory firms which provide cover for our investigators
13 and, secondly, we have a few firms which we cwn which are

14 proprietary: if you will, whereby our investigators appear to
15 be private. ~

16 I said that in the past it is. clear : that on occasion wea
7 dia ask for private investigator firms to help us to some

18 degree. It was usually the one that was giving us cover, and

~ .
for reasons of overload we asked them to have their own people

20 to do a few of the investigations.

21 My General Counsel says that this is illegal. I have a
22 strong question about its propriety, if not legality, and I
23 am undertaking to review this matter to see whether we can not
24 just eliminate that practics entirely, continuing the preprie-
25 tary and continuing the ase cf private investigators as cever
