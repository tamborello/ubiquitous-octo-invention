into the death of his wife, DERYLE CIOTTI.

generally related to the welfare of the children and his
plans to take the children out over the weekend.

children and JENNIE CLARK, DERYLE's younger sister.

hours prior to the time DERYLE CIOTTI's body was discovered.

of the individuals involved in cutting up the Charger used
in the Bensenville killing are "BUDDY" CIOTTI, "SONNY" GALE,
and JOSEPH CIMINO. Two Melrose Park detectives, possibly
TONY STALLATO (ph) and KENNY FURLINETTO (ph) saw blue acety-
line torch arc lights flashing in a garage at 3:00 AM, -
They found CIOTTI, GALE and CIMINO cutting up the aforemen-
tioned Charger. The three were taken to the Police Station

those involved. ; ;

June and July of 1975, that NICK CIOTTI refuses to discuss

INFORMANTS

0G 9561-PC advised on May 2, 1975 that the recent
Not Guilty verdict in the Teamster Union case came as a’

‘complete surprise to him and he felt certain that the defense

attorneys were equally surprised. A week or so before the’:
verdict was returned a very close friend of his had a con-
versation with JULIUS ECHLES, who represented RONALD DE ;
ANGELES, ECHLES told his friend in no uncertain terms that
IRWIN WEINER and his client RON DE ANGELES, were "sunk" and
that there was only an outside chance that ALLAN DORFMAN
would get off. Informant stated that he had not heard
anything indicating any irregularities about the procedures
of this case.

Informant went on to state that the prosecuting
attorneys are young and lack experience, in particular
concerning 'jury selections". -He stated the Government
has numerous prerogatives in jury selection compared to.
limited choices by the defense. He stated that if any

‘mistake was made it was made by the prosecuting attorneys

in not seeing to it that there were’ at least one or two
jurors who had some accounting or management experience.
Informant stated from what he heard this was a "below
average" type of a jury comprised mostly of housewives and
unemployed individuals. If this was the case, informant
stated there was no doubt in his mind this jury got lost in
the mise of evidence and could not-assemble the facts in
such a way that they were convinced "beyond a reasonable
doubt" that the defendants were guilty. :

Informant stated he heard there was. quite a.
celebration after the Not Guilty verdict and-he also
heard from several "friends" that the cost of the defense

“in attorneys fees amounted to $800,000.00 and most of

this was paid by ALLAN DORFMAN. Informant stated there
was no doubt where DORFMAN got his money to pay off this
huge amount.

CG 6890-CTE advised on May 1, 1975, that there
was a good deal of talk but no proof that "BUDDY" CIOTTI's |

'. wife was dead before she was placed in the car in the

CIOTTI garage where the charger was cut up. CIOTTI and
his wife did not get along. He knew that she was hanging
around the basement of the old Casa Madrid and that she was
being "banged" by a bunch of hillbillies and because of
this he used to beat her... CIOTTI claimed he found her in
his garage in a car with the motor running. No autopsy
was performed.

CG 6457-PC advised on May 5, 1975 that she was

“'not in a position to know exactly where VICKI CIMINO was

recently residing. PC indicated that the following telephone
numbers were listed for VICKI CIMINO, one of which was
supposed to be the apartment in which VICKI and JOSEPH

CIMINO resided, telephone 865-8242 (non-published), telephone
343-3443 (listed to Le A. SCORZA), 1634 Broadway, Melrose
Park, Illinois.
