i, Dr. Charles Bohrer recommesés (subject to Howard
Osborne's concurrence) that the tw: fellewing defectors
be added to the Brezhnev visit watch list:

a. Anatoliy GOLITZYN (AELADLE). Delusions of
> grandeur; expected much more from z3e U.S. Government than
he in fact received in terms of persenzal recognition. fFrus-
trated, reclusive. May take some ectioa to “get even,"

2 b. Yuri NOSSENKO (AEDONOR} Not seriously neurotic,
nes but because of the way in which he was handled he has reason
to be vengeful, and may take the Brezhnev visit as an oppor-

tunity to embarrass us.

1. Howard Osborn's recommendations for the Brezhnev
"watch list":

a. Delete NOSSENKO. He's happily rehabilitated,
well disposed toward CIA and the USG, well adjusted. -Not
a threat.

b. GOLENIEWSKI. Absolutely nutty. Put hin at
. the top of the list. He hates ‘the Soviet Government because
it's depriving him of the Romanov crown jewels. . o

VU c. Anatoliy GOLITZYN. Agree with Bohrer. Put
him on the list. :
