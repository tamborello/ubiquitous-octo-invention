a. Purging ce

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following: —

(1) Duplicate material, Le. exact copy(s) of a document.

fo (2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless | it has beea the basis for
the opening.

(3) All abstract slips.
(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.

(8) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch
cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments.

(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
by the Records Officer.

(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in-a 201 dossier
forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention |
in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized
officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret, classification. ~
authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained’ :

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-I; 27 October 1966

L INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM
The principal features of the 201 system are: .

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that _
individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form’ (Form ee
" 831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individ, ie, per- ° ~- oO
sonal history, current status, and prospects. cooots
ae : The ‘Master 20r Record: a “niaching ‘yeoord Ginetbied “by” the opening oF
a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 refererice for the Main Index and * °
stores the pertinent : information which may later be retrieved! for special listings.

: d. Matin Index Mester 01 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an .
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding di data items | or r lines will be moved up and the ref.
erence consolidated. .

e. OF Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 jper-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OF
codes for use by components: .

(1) general Ol codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OT codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.

A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned

paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.

f. 201 Mashine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

-The opening of a 201. dossier is the prerogative: of an Operational com

will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on { :
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per- ;
sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those } Sty
persons for whom provisional operational. approvals and operational approvals’, = 89 | =

persons who are only of local interest to a field station or ‘Headquarters desk
and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO
records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require-

ments.on ISG for automatic 201 openings én certain categories of persons whose -

names appear in incoming dispatches. These’ are listed in Attachment 2, 201

dossiers should be opened in the following categories: re

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-
proval requests, However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested
for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-
tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Person for whom the field requests a 201 opening.

(3) [SuFLxrURg) personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than
denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel. ~

_) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part 1

~ (8) Persons on whom a Main Index search teveals information in five .

or more documents (see DOI 70-20). ;

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/
ISR (opened only by IP/RMS).
b. Requesting a 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting
a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the

- master 201 record and 201 machine. listings and to register the assign-

ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists ‘of sample

201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's. A field -
“station anay requést the opening ‘of a 20) file by writing 201- in the Head- 2

" quarters file of- cross-réference box on the dispatch form and/or after’ the
subject’s name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for ¢ a 201 opening
is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by
placing 201- after'the term “File” on the last line of the transmission.-IP/AN

will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the résponsi-
bility of the desk to‘respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of

201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.
