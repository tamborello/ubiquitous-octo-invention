DE TOLVE is also the brother-in-law of GIANCANA. The reference
. to "them guys out south" is a reference to the hoodiums associated
-with MURRAY HUMPHREYS. .From the conversation, it is obvious
that D'ARCO was originally supported by. HUMPHREYS when he ran
for Alderman eight years ago. It would appear, however, that
D'ARCO is extremely reluctant to approach HUMPHREYS in regard
to.enlisting his support against GIANCANA and it would also
appear that GIANCANA has much more power concerning political
appointments than does HUMPHREYS even though heretofore it
has been felt by the Chicago Office that HUMPHREYS more or
less had the final say in regard to political affairs. From
the above it would appear that GIANCANA does not need the
‘approval of any other Chicago top hoodlum in order to make or
break public officials and politicians.

 

The reference to "TISH" is:apparently a reference
to ANTHONY TISCI. TISCI is.a Chicago public official who has
offices at 1 North LaSalle in Chicago and who is sponsored by
D'ARCO but is extremely close to GIANCANA.

. The reference to QUILICI is a reference to Judge
GEORGE QUILICI who for years,was a municipal judge but who
was elected last month to the Superior Court of Cook County.
Apparently GIANCANA ordered D'ARCO to elect QUILICI "or else."

. It is note hat QUILICI won a heavy majority of votes in the.
First Ward ka November.

The reference to "CAPONE's son*’s restaurant in
Florida" is a reference to the restaurant operated by SONNY
. CAPONE in Miami Beach. :

 

The reference to POPE is a reference to the now
deceased Judge POPE of the Superior Court of Cook County. —

The reference to PORKY is a reference to JOSEPH
PORCARO , who is the Republican Ward Committeeman of the 28th ‘
Ward. It is noted that CG 6498-PC recently advised that he i
met with GIANCANA surreptitiously in a restaurant in North {
Riverside, Illinois. - It was GIANCANA's purpose to request .
the PCI to support PORCARO in the 28th Ward for Alderman of that
Ward. It is noted that this PCI is the primary political -
power in the 28th Ward. CG 6498-PC advised that he has known
for many years that PORCARO is supported by TONY ACCARDO, :
who is referred to above as "JOE B."
