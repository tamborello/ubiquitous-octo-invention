that MORA stated OSWALD’s activities before he wept to Russia
and not his activities before’ he went to Nexico bx
Concerning the statement which MORA made to {iex- 18 Pa

and MEX- 1g) that OSWALD: was, well known in Russia among the
- Americans who were there at the same time as he was and that
he was "ot that much of a nut," meaning that he could not

ve undertaken gingly to assassinate President Kennedy, MIEICy
(MEX-18 and nex) consider that it was MORA 's thought that
j Subject could not have undertaken the assassination of
President Kennedy alone Mu)

 

As was noted in paragraph 3, page 2, of Mexico City
letterhead memorandum dated 3/16/64, MORA did not divulge her
source of her information regarding the impression of OSWALD Cu
gained by Americans in the Soviet Union. Since{MEX-18 and ® ;
| MEX-19f have heard MORA make the statement previously that
/ she has corresponded with MARY LOUISDARATTERSON, who has been
i residing in the Soviet Union, it is these informants’ belief
' that PATTERSON is the source in Russia Las \} vy that joe

was well known among Americans there. MAIN YU & fan . wae?

| / Girx- 18 and MEX- 1g}nave advised that they ‘hope to.
. determine from MORA furthey details regarding her previous’
statements about OSWALD. £/ a)

Gc Ne) Cu
\
From information which {iiex- 18 and MEX~ 19) hav ;

2 learned about MORA becoming a Mexican citizen, it is considered | |

that if MORA were interviewed, she would be antagonistic

because she js strongly aware_of her rights as a Mexican &) Al

citizen and{ MEX-18 and MEX-19fhave advised previously tha
i if any Mexican police attempt to at any time interview her,
i j they are going to run into "a tiger. If she were to be
: interviewed by the Mexican police or by any representative
of the United States Government, there are no grounds to
believe that she would be cooperative in any manner and the “al

 

probability exists that she would be astute enough to determine
that she has told only fiiex- 18 and MEX- xra]tne information and
. : this would expose these informants.

It is noted that [MEX- 18 and MEX-— -19] have advised
that they are unable to ascertain information from MORA
through direct questions. Whenever a question is made to
MORA, she ceases talking, and the only manner in which these
informants are able to ascertain data from MORA is to needle
- her, then sit Bay with a sympathetic ear listen to what

|
she has to sa
| " eg) (e) :
| : Gjex-18. ana wx ae? to learn from MORA addi-
tional details in order to answer the pertinent questions
which have arisen, and they intend to pursue vigorously the
objective set forth for them concerning any information MORA
has in her possession concerning OSWALD. o date these
informants have not been able to meet with MORA for a two
or three day period because of her illness and -her other
preoccupations. Present plans are for them to take MORA r
\on a two or three day "vacation" in the first half of April.
As soon as these informants have met with MORA, this will
be ‘reported immediately, and recommendations will b ade
as to any additional investigative steps to be taken) OXY“.

The reason for Mexico City letterhead memorandum
dated 3/16/64, being classified SECRET" is being detailed
fully as follows:

T letterhead me andum was classified "SECRET"
to protect |MEX-18 and MEX-19) ho are informants in Mexico CU)
furnishing highly sensitive information involving espionage

and information vital to the internal security of the United
States. It. is essential that the identities of these informants
be fully protected, especially since they are the only source.
which received the information and MORA is not known to have
discussed the information in the letterhead memorandum with .
anyone else. Under the circumstances, the protection of these
informants is of paramount interest to the continued operations
of the Bureau in Mexico, and for fhis reason the letterhead
memorandum bare classified : "3 e&)

on office will continue to direct (MEX-18 and
MEX-19}to vigorously pursue their proposed contact with MORA _
and t results will be promptly reported to the Bureau. a.)
