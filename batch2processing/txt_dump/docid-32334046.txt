had been given to the New

portion of the jewelry which
Jersey man to hold.

The informant was not aware just who had gone

into the victim's home at

the time of the robbery. It

was his impression from talking to MIKE SWIATEK that the
jewelry had gone to Chicago where it was subsequently
sold to RED STEINHART of New York. The informant was
not aware whether or not it actually went to STEINHART

in.smuch as the informant

was with MIKE SWIATEK in New

york the previous week, at which time they ran into
RED STEINHART and STEINHART was not known to SWIATEK.

It is noted that JOSEPH MEROLA was interviewed

by Pittsburgh SAs JOHN S.

PORTELLA and THOMAS G@. FORSYTH,

III in Miami at the request of MEROLA, made to Departmental
Attorneys WILLIAM KENNEY and WILLIAM KEHOE.

Prior to the commencement of the interview on
August 14, 1961, Departmental Attorneys KENNEY and KEHOE
spent approximately ten minutes alone with MEROLA, after
which SAs PORTELLA and FORSYTH were called into KENNEY's

office, Room 201, Federal

Building, Miami. Before. the

beginning of the interview, K&NNEY advised SAs PORTEJ.LA
and FORSYTH that MEROLA had vet the conditions that the

Departmental Attorneys be

from Fort Lauderdale, and has no desire to have anything to
do with him. He stated, however, that POLLACK called nie
yesterday, while he was out and left a message for him to
call back. ;

LASSNER stated that POLLACK has never discussed
his activities with him, but that he knows that .POLLACK
is broke and 1s probably ready to try for a "score". He
sala. that, despite his desire to remain away from POLLACK,
he will: maintain contact with him on behalf of the New
York Office for any information he can develop. He stated
that it-4s very likely that POLLACK might ask him (LASSNER)
to aocempany him to Cape Cod, if POLLACK goes there, since
he has invited LASSNER to go with him for.weekends in the
past, LASSNER s{iated that he would not accompany POLLACK
to Cape God, but will be alert to any conversation by
POLLACK regarding plans to go to Cape Cod and will notify
the New York Office immediately.

Concerning the pousibility that POLLACK intends
to "heist" the jewelry owned by PAT MAGEE, LASSNER advised
that this possibility is very likely, inasmuch as PAT
MAGBE has much valuable jewelry and POLLACK is desperate
for money. LASSNER stated that POLLACK would never even
hint to him of such plans,; however, because POLLACK knows
that ‘LASSNER has been a clese friend of PAT MAGEE for years
and that LASSNER dated PAT long before she met HEWITT...

In connection with information furnished by
LASSNER to former SA CARL ROOD about the activities of the
two "trigger men" named PAT and MIKE(from Chicago and their
allegad kidnapping and murder activities, LASSNER advised
that he received this information from HERKIE STYLES. He
stated that STYLES obtained some of the information from
living across the hall from PAT and MIKE and deduced some
of it as a result of questions asked of him by the FBI
concerning. PAT and MIKE, LASSNER stated that STYLES is
presently in New York and that if the FBI wishes to
re-interview him, LASSNER will contact him for the New
York ‘Office. ‘

fa _ LASSNER stated that, at no time, did he observe
any weapona containing silencers, while at MEROLA's home.
