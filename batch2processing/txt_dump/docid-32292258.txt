to the camp and was paid for by ALEX along with his account
when he left. BROWN states that BARNEY LAMM's Ball Lake
Lodge is probably the best in the Kenora area, rates being
around $40.00 a day. LAMM. is an American from around Detroit
Lakes, Minnesota, but has now become a naturalized Canadian.
BROWN states that LAMM has co-operated with him on many
occasions and he believes LAMM and his staff to be of the
highest order. . BROWN stated that there appeared to be

no reason for instant trip by ALEX to Ball Lake except for
ALEX and his associates to engage in some fishing and
relaxation. BROWN estimated that the bill for ALEX and

his associates came to approximately $300.00 on an individual .
basis for the time that they were at the camp. He was not
able to determine how the bill was paid. He could furnish

no information regarding any individual in ALEX's ‘group

lwing been called by the name of RIP. ,

at 3:42 PM on a North Central Flight from International. Falls,
Minnesota. The three then went directly to the United Air-
lines ticket counter where LADON made arrangements. for them
to leave on the 4:00 Flight. While LADON was making these
arrangements, VOGEL took three cardboard cartons about one
foot square and a red and white plastic bag and gave them to
a colored porter who placed the items in locker number 201,
While this was going on, GUS ALEX stood in the background.
A conference then insued between the three individuals after
which time LADON returned to the ticket counter and cancelled
the previous flight. arrangements and made arrangements to
leave on Flight. number 404, which was scheduled to leave

Minneapolis at 5:00 PM and arrive at Midway Airport, Chicago, —

at 7:00 PM. ‘LADON made the arrangements under the name of

These individuals did not bring any fish back, and
said they were not shipping any back but said fishing was
very good at Ball Lake. They also advised customs men they
had not been to Ball Lake before and this was the first
time they had met BARNEY LAMM. GUS ALEX was carrying what:
appeared to be an 8 mm movie camera.

At about 12:25 PM, on August 24, 1961, ROBERT.
PALMER, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Fort Frances, Canada
advised he had received word from his fellow employee RON .
BROWN at Kenora that subject and his companions had been at
Ball Lake with a SAM TAYLOR and another man and woman, A
few minutes later, STANLEY MEYER, United States Customs Agent
advised he had just checked a metallic purple 1961 Pontiac,
four-door, into the United States and this car had an Illinois
License, 3 people in the car, and the driver was a SAM TAYLOR.
The car and riders had been given the usual cursory check
and no additional data was obtained except that these indivi-
duals ha@ been to Ball Lake. Efforts were immediately c0-
ordinated between United States Customs, Border Patrol,
International Falls Police Department, and this Bureau to
locate the car in the United States. It was located travel-
ing South and the car was stopped at Orr, Minnesota, 55 miles
from International Falls. Here the individuals apparently stopped.
to stretch and went into the gas station. Also at this point
the United States Customs and United States Border Patrol made
contact with the passengers. SAM TAYLOR, the driver, did the
talking for the group. He was very arrogant and refused to
be searched or his car checked as he had been entered into
the United States at International Falls. Customs officer FRANK

‘DURZENSKI immediately telephonically checked with his office

and was advised he had the authority to examine the car and
occupants thoroughly even at this point and also that SAM
TAYLOR was listed on the "U. S. Attorney General's Racket
List." He also verified that GUS ALEX and VOGEL are listed
in the United States Customs Lookout Book. ~

The Pontiac had Illinois License GH 8848, Customs
determined the registered owner to be a DOMINIC SIBILANO,
5541 West Belmont, Chicago, Illinois, a furniture dealer.

Customs Officer DURZENSKI stated he seemed to
recall that SIBILANO was somehow associated with a, name
not recalled, undertaker in Chicago about 2h to 3 years ago
and this undertaker is now in jail for "dipping" into the
estate of some woman he had in the mortuary,

PERKOVICH mentioned to DURZENSKI that he and
Mr. and Mrs. TAYLOR had been at Ball Lake for the past
nine days. .

_ Royal Canadian Mounted Police PALMER advised on
August 24, 1961 that LAMM is a landed immigrant in Canada
but not a Canadian citizen.

: On August 21, 1961, SA KARL M, ZEIMES noted
subject ALEX was met at the Minneapolis Airport Terminal by
a person described as white, male, late 40s or early 50s,
dark complexion, approximatdy 6 feet tall, about 200 pounds,
wearing small black check sport coat and carrying tan top
coat and medium-sized. dark leather bag. . This person and ALEX
left on North Central Flight Number 683, 11:45 AM for
International Falls, Minnesota.

On August 31, 1961, Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Officer ROBERT PALMER, Fort Frances, Ontario, Canada, advised
that Corporal RON BROWN ‘of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Detachment at Kenora, Canada, had just been transferred to
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Detachment at Fort William,
Canada, and he may be somewhat late in furnishing whatever
information he had regarding subject's trip to Ball Lake,

On September 1, 1961, Corporal BROWN was telephonically
contacted at Fort William, Canada, at which time he advised
that he was in the process of transferring and he would
furnish what information he had in the near future. On
September 15, 1961, information was received from Corporal
BROWN that he was able to develope only very little information
at Ball Lake in this matter. He did determine that a phone
call was made by subject ALEX to a HARRY HOLLEY, telephone
number PI 8-0939, Chicago, Illinois. This call was billed
