Matula is an International Trustee of the Teamsters
Union. LA-4350=C has advised our LA office that when
Matula served time in the County Jail and County” honor
farm several years ago in connection with a perjury
conviction he became very depressed and actually cried.
As a result of this Matula reportedly would do, anything
to prevent himself from being incarcerated again... This
source stated that because of Matula's experience, he is’
very cautious in getting directly involved in situations
that could cause him trouble with law enforcement.

“- Matula is presently on parole in connection with this

perjury. conviction.

Matula has been contacted recently by our LA office
in an effort to obtain access to Local 396 records in

“connection with case captioned "Mike Harabedian; Frank J.

Matula, Jr. etal LMRA-IM Bufile 122-3019. Matula at time
of this contact advised he would first have to contact the
Union attorney to obtain permission.. The Union attorney
later advised our LA office that. the General. Counsél of
the Union desired a subpoena be issued for the books and
records.

“It is felt the above facts indicate an interview
with Matula as outlined in this airtel might be
benefitial and should be conducted.
