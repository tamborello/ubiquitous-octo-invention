While some of these travellers proceeded to Cuba by
other routes, the great majority passed through Mexico on
thelr way. Or the most conservative basis, then, it will
be seen that there cannot have been fewer than 4912 travellers
to Cuba during the year 1962, while the average monthly
number passing through Mexico for the first two months of
1963 is even higher than the 1962 average,

Of the total number visiting Cuba, the Central Intelli-
gence Agency estimates that at least 1500, and perhaps as
many as 2000, have received ideological indoctrination. or
guerrilla warfare training. Many of these are still in
Cuba. Others have returned to their homelands; Some BY ae?
legitimate means; some probably by illicit means,“

Prior to the October crisis, Latin Americans travelling
to Cuba usually moved by regular commercfal airlines or, on
occasion, by specially chartered Cubana flights. Some
travelled to Trinidad or Curacao and thence by regularly
scheduled Cubana.or KIM flights to Havana. ‘ Others travelled
to Mexico, and from there by Mexicana or Cubana commercial
flights to Havana. ‘With the cessation of service to Cuba
by. Pan American, KLM, Mexicana, and Iberia airlines in
October, the regular Cubana service between Mexico City
and Havana remained the sole direct and regular airline

connection betwen Cuba and the remainder of Latin America. ©

The Cubana service between Havana and Mexico is scheduled
to operate twice weekly, but sometimes only a single flight is
completed per week, Alreraft now employed are British Bri-_
tannias -~ an obsolescent model. Cubana has requested, but
has not yet received, Mexican approval to substitute Soviet
IL-18 transports for the old Britannias. Delay by the Mexicans

in granting this approval can have the favorable effect of |

 

impeding travel, as the Britannias are now in poor condition, -
If, in addition, the British and Canadians can be induced to
suspend delivery of spare parts, the planes will soon become
lnoperative.

Iberia airlines resumed its regular twice-monthly
flights from Madrid to Havana on 11.February. This flight
makes one stop, in the Azores, before reaching Havana. ~-

KLM has not yet resumed its regular flights to Cuba
from the Netherlands Antilles. However, it is now considering
doing so. In this regard it is cont eee rat resumption of
scheduled flights by a United States carrier could serve as
an encouragement to KLM and others to do the same. _

Soviet and Czech airlines serving Cuba do not stop
regularly at any other Latin American country, though: the
Soviet Aeroflot line has occasionally sought and received

permission from Brazil to land at Recife, en route to Cuba.

II. Nature and Scope of the Problem

We do not know enough about the movement of subversive
_ trainees into Cuba and - more important - out of Cuba. We
do not’ know enough about the volume of travel, or the media
employed, This is particularly true in the area of illicit
traffic, where our knowledge is extemely limited.
Regarding legitimate travel to Cuba, CIA presents the
following estimate: .

Second Working Draft

CUBA
‘THE MOVEMENT OF SUBVERSIVES
AND SUBVERSIVE TRAINEES

 

 

I. Introduction

The actions proposed herein are designed to impede the
flow of subversives between Cuba and other Latin American
countries, Execution of any one or more of the enumerated
actions will ameliorate the situation; execution of them
all will not completely solve it. The practical problems
involved are too numerous and complex. .

With respect to diminishing legitimate travel to Cubas
we face multiple problems in the policies and attitudes of
_those Latin American countries through which the subversive
traveller must pass. From the viewpoint of these nations
the direct actions required have strong political and some-
times legal implications; implications which cannot be over-
come easily, even where the leaders of these countries
choose to do so.

In the matter of clandestine travel, we are confronted
net enliy with the great depth of communist guile, born.of two

generations of experience in the international movement of

subversives, but with the inexperience, ineptitude and
lack of awareness in these same matters on the part of
the Latin.American community.

In spite of this, the advantages do not all reside
with the communists. Cuba is an island. Its insular
character.imposes certain sharp limitations upon personal
movement. Cuba has no frontiers’ with other states; every-
one who enters the country must do so either by water,
or air. There can be no slipping through the Lees wire,

On the other hand, this~same—geographic ebro Malo
makes clandestine entry and exit reasonably simple. There
are 3,825 linear miles of essentially unpatrolled Central
“American coastline, between 175 and 850 miles of Cuba. There
are. at least 93 airfields, other than United States, within.
700 miles of the island, and the ships and craft, indigenous
to the Caribbean and capable of supporting the subversive
ebb and flow, number well into the thousands.

Even in the face of these unfavorable factors, a
program of direct restraints, selected from among the actions»
enumerated herein, can have favorable effects. Under the.
proposed steps some travel would be stopped completely.

More - probably much more - would be rendered difficult,

Some hitherto legitimate movement would be driven underground.
