period of time that such installation could be operated, and
because the Pittsburgh Office had not developed any information
that people other than SAMUEL MANNARINO's secretary occupied
the motel unit.

phases of the activities of the MANNARINOs had agreed that

Westmoreland County raid of 9/17/61, the FGJ inquiry in
Pittsburgh, and the election of reform candidates for the
New Kensington city administration had all combined to make
an information vacwwnin that city, due to drastically
curtailed gambling and the resultant inactivity of the
MANNARINOs and their associates-employees,
