Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act
of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The Act established the Assassination Records Review
Board (ARRB) to oversee the governments’ production and
compliance with the Act. The ARRB reviews the proposed
postponements in documents sent to the National Archives and
Records Administration (NARA) and decides what postponements the
Act allows or opens the document in full. ‘The ARRB's
responsibilities include having agencies search other subjects
and areas to find any additional material not already identified
as assassination records. The establishment of the ARRB by the
Act also limited the time for their duties to be accomplished.
The ARRB must complete their tasks by September 1997. With this
deadline in mind, the ARRB sent a letter requesting additional
information. ;

Enclosures: ARRB letter requesting material

Details: On March 10, 1997, the ARRB sent a letter to the FBI
setting forth a formal request to receive and review additional
records. The ARRB's goal is to research every possible subject
that may have a bearing on assassination theories and to assure
Congress and the American public that all was done to accomplish
the intentions of the Act.
