Gonzalo¥Facio of Costa Rica are also on the list of persons
to be assassinated, he said.

Because of the importance of these revelations, PRENSA LATINA
is publishing the complete text of the interview granted by

Carlos Rivero Collado to Radio Havana Cuba.

MODERATOR: With us today is Carlos Rivero Collado, a former
Cuban counterrevolutionary leader who for the past few

years has been carrying out revolutionary activities abroad.
Because of his Social origin and family ties, he became 4
counterrevolutionary on the very day the Revolution triumphed.
He began to work with different groups and take active part in
counterrevolutionary activities, including the invasion of. . Playa
Giron. In most of these activities, he played important roles.

However, his personal experiences led him gradually to see the .
intrinsic amorality and repugnance of the enemies of the Revolu~
tion, and the decomposition and evils of the capitalist system.
He began to realize that the works of the Revolution were aimed
at safeguarding the Cuban nation's highest values and the best
interests of its people. From then on, and for several years,
Rivero Collado worked for the revolution outside the country,
expressing the political and ideological transformation he had
undergone in his every-day work.

We now give the floor to the newsmen. Comrade Pradoeoe
