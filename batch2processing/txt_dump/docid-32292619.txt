lot a total distance from the AL of approximately 60 ft.
_is situated three apartment buildings that extend westward
to the next street. These apartment buildings like the AL
front on Roosevelt Road facing south. To the rear of the
AL and the apartment buidd@ings is an alleyway that parallels
Roosevelt Road along side.of which runs an aerial telephone
cable feeding the buildings primarily facing south along
Roosevelt Road. (u) — .

Directly to the rear of the AL is a telephone pole
which mounts a terminal box that feeds the three telephone
instruments in the AL, One of these telephones is a coin
; phone and the others are a WC set number 554 (Western Electric)
! and its extension an HC set ngmber 306. The latter instrument
is situated in the room occupied by GIANCANA, which measures

approximately 14 X 16 ft. [U

 

. The only multiple of the number 306HC set within
r 1,000 ft. of the AL is situated in a terminal box mounted
: on the pole at the rear of 1135 Ferdinand Street. This pole

A the buildings in the area covered by the multiple appearance
it would appear that the residence of 1135 Ferdinand Street
is best suited for monitoring purposes. No contact
