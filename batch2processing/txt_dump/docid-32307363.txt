wired with burglar alarms, etc. It is to be noted FOREMAN's
‘office space is located in a row-type two story building,
for example, one door enters a bank then the next door enters
the lower stairway leading up to FOREMAN's office on the
second floor of the building. In addition, in this same row
block of buildings a restaurant, bar, etc, are located. It

"4s to be noted a survey of FOREMAN's building reflects the
premises have been undergoing remodeling in the past few
‘months, It is my sincere opinion that to utilize any ;
investigative technique other than a tesur the risk would be
‘too great for the anticipated results.

It ‘will be noted in referenced Dallas teletype.
Dallas requests that this office attempt to determine if’
CIVELLO was in Houston approximately one month ago, Although
no- information has been developed positively by this office to
this effect, it is only. natural to presume that CIVELLO was
in Houston to confer with FOREMAN inasmuch as on 4/15/61 when
Attorney FOREMAN telephonically contacted this office he
advised that CIVELLO was at that time in his, FOREMAN's,
office, This data was set forth to the Bureau and Dallas in
Houston airtel dated 4/18/61.

Dallas is “requested to'follow the activities of
EDWARD ARTHUR STRICKLAND through Dallas PCI, an attorney
representing STRICKLAND, in order that this office can be
advised in the event STRICKLAND contemplates coming to Houston
so that STRICKLAND and any of his associates might be placed
under appropriate surveillance to determine their contacts in
Houston, This would likewise apply to subject CIVELLO. ; /

‘Dallas is requested to immediately secure the most
recent photograph of STRICKLAND who was arrested by the Dallas
: Sheriff's Office 9/2/60, and forward same to this office for
, assistance in conducting a surveillance in the event Dallas
determines that STRICKLAND is coming to Houston,
