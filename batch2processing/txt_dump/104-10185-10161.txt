a d. The affiliation commission will form the initial
body of writers of che Community within a six-month
period. Thereafter, acceptance of new members will
be suspended for six months, but will then be renewed
? in order to facilitate the work of organizing the
Second Congress of the Latin American Cultural

Community.

-2. Carlos Pellicer and Juan Rulfo are respectively the president
. and vice-president of the Asociacion de Escritores Mexicanos,
° A.C. (Association of Mexicin Writers - AEMAC), see MEXI-6177
. of 5 February 1966, an organization dedicated ostensibly to
bettering tne welfare ot writers through increased fringe
* . benefits as well as better publication and distribution of
their works. Its constitution specifically forbade its in-
2 - volvement in political affairs or entanglement with inter-
. national organizations. Mario Monteforte is a member of
” this organization. During recent months, under. the aegis
of Pellicer and Rulfo, efforts have been underway to revise
this constitution in such a way as tc repeal these provisions
without at the same time alienating those of the members who
are opposed to dropping these provisions. Pellicer, it will
be remembered, attended the COMES meeting in Genoa last year,
at which the formation of the CLE was discussed.

 

3. Despite the vagueness of the wording of articles 3, 4 and
5 (see numbering in attached news clipping) there is no
disputing their political. nature. Monteforte alleged to
LICOOKY that he did hot feel the wording of these three
articles-is beyond the bounds of reason for a “non-political”
organization. LICOOKY concedes that their wording is subject
to the broadest interpretation if Monteforte should ever louse
the “conductor's baton." Both are guilty of disingenuousness
or at best naivete, since these articles seem to us to be not
only a license, but almost a-battle cry for political militancy

from community members. | .

4. During his trip, Monteforte claims to have met the Chilean
President and the Foreign Minister. The former, with whom
Monteforte discussed the idea of the comunidades, agreed to
write to President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz ef Mexico stressing to
him the importance of support for the comunidades. The impli-
cation is that Mexico's financial and m6ral support for the
next Cultural Congress will be sought in this ways

5.. The organizing commission for the Caribbean section of
the Comunidad Latinoamericana de Escritores (Community of Latin
American Writers - CLE) has begun issuing invitations to both
individuals and organizations to join. The AEMAC has received

such an invitation, but legally still must chaige its constitu-
1 can join, The letter 6 nvitation did not

“reprint—the-basic principles of the CCCL to which the invited
organization would be expected to subscribe. Whether this was
a deliberate omission in the nature of entrapment, or whether

it was felt articles such as the atiached had adequately covered
the ground, is not known,

6. Owing to LICOOKY-1's planned departure from the area

the end of June 1966, it is not likely Station will have the
same insight into the progress of the CLE,

CONTTRUATION OF DIEPATCE o}e FGA-29207

 

‘JT. The Station belLeves that most or all articles.attacking the Conference,
end particularly those mtacking LICOOKY-1, were Soviet inspired, and it is further
believed that SEM) wrote most if not all articles attacking the Conference which
appeared in La Vox, Polftica and Sucesos. The Soviets, who are protably aware of
previous Cuban charges tlhet LICOOXY-1 {9 an ODYOKE accent, probably feleethat es
en American closely eaesoctated with the AEMAC LICOOKY-] would be vulnerehle to

such an attack,

8 As a remit of the Sucesns article of 4 June 1036 an orfi
Ministry of Government did visit LICOGKY*l to check on her docune:
a official sald that he did not believe toe charres mate in the 81
but since Ler tourist vies had expired he advised ker to immediately leave the
he provided her with @ letter to show io

Mexicen bowler sutheritiesa permitting her exit.
is expected to return to Mexico in « few days. : |

9. Ag Headquarters 1a aware, LICOCKY-1 will be termingted effective
30 June lcds the decision to terminate her was mate some tlre ago, prior to the
occurrence of the Conference and the reculting edverse propacanda. While ahe
may be of some occealonal use should ghe retum: to and retain in Mexico, 4t ia
believed that the raceal adverse propecenda has lapolred her future usefulness
in Mexico, although wany Mexicans undoubtedly do uot believe the charves anuj
others ofiered to “come to her defeuse.”

16. A dispatch will be prepared and forverded vhen the termination has been
Completed, and any new devalopwents witb reepec!. to her alleced participation in
the above Conference will be included in that diepatch.
