REPUBLIC OF CONGO (LEOPOLDVILLE)

   
 

Minister of Defense

  

OFFICE OF
CENTRAL REFERENCE

   

: Jerome Anany, Minister of Defense since July
1962, is one of the most capable and honest men in
the Congo government ‘and has often been suggested
as a possible successor to Premier Cyrille Adoula.
Lacking. the finesse of Adoula in his dealings with
foreigners, Anany is neither an orator nor diplomat;
but a blunt, hard-working, and diligent person,
possessed with singlemindedness, a fair degree of
executive ability, impartiality and integrity. One
of the most popular men in the government, he has
been acclaimed by all parliamentary groups and was
one of few ministers to receive an ovation upon entering the Chamber of
Deputies room during the November 1962 parliamentary crisis; his name
appears on almost all projected cabinet lists of both governmental and
opposition groups. Were he named Premier, he would probably be more
decisive and more willing to exercise his authority than is °Adoula,
and would readily accept guidance from the moderate circle of advisors
who currently support Adoula. Conservative in his views, the Defense
Minister is staunchly anti-Communist, and friendly to Western interests,
although not necessarily ideologically motivated. Anany is founder and ,
one of the principal leaders of the Parti Democrat Congolais (PDC), a
political party which is moderate in nature and, although still in the
formative stages, may become a significant moderate national party.

Anany was born on 19 May 1919 at Lisala, (formerly Equateur province),
into a family originally from Kivu province -- it is in Kivu that his
political base lies. A man of limited education, he served as a clerk
for many years until he moved into politics .as vice president of the

‘Kivu section of the Union Congolaise. He joined the Parti National du
Progress (PNP) and soon became vice president of its Kivu section and
treasurer-general of the national organization. Entering national
politics shortly before independence, he attended the January-February
1960 Round Table Conference in Brussels and later that year was nemed
to head a study and information mission in Europe. He was a member of
the Congolese delegation to the Euro-African Interparliamentary Con- ~
ference on Conditions for Membership of African States in the Common
Market, Strasbourg, France, in June, 1961. . Elected a Senator from Kivu
province, he came into political prominance when he was appointed to
head an investigating committee following the Kindu and Kongolo massacres
in early 1962, was appointed extraordinary commissioner for Kivu in May
of that year, and entered the cabinet as Minister of Defense in July.

In October 1963 he was named head of a three-man state of emergency
committee constituted to govern the city of Leopoldville in view of in-
pending labor strikes.

ANANY (cont.) ,

Considerably older than most Congolese politicians, Anany possesses
a quiet dignity and soft-spoken manner. He is described as a man of
vision, concentration, determination and force. . Following his appoint-
ment to the cabinet in August 1962, he began his tenure by asserting
his authority over General Joseph Mobutu, Commander of the Congolese

‘National Army, and has gradually been earning increasing respect from

all governmental spheres. He has traveled extensively and continuously
throughout the country, gathering excellent first«hand knowledge of

situations in the bush, although he has a tendency to oversimplify these’.
