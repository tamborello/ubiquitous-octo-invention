“Mexico City - Oswald

 

This would not involve CIA directly. Appreciation
for our sensitivity on the sources-and-methods issue was
stated. They want to concentrate on Oswald in Mexico.
Who did he see, what company did he find, what did he do.

For instance, there is testimony that he threatened
‘President Kennedy when there. There is conflicting
testimony, and they want to introduce it.

We pointed out that the only real hard evidence of
Oswald's contacts with Cuban and Soviet officials was
from CIA teltaps. It was in this way that we knew that
he had dealt with Sylvia Duran in the Cuban Consulate,
so we had the Mexicans question her. The Warren Commission
was able to quote her, alluding to the existence of con-
firming evidence (thus protecting our telephone operations).
He stated that they hope to have her testify (although it
appears that her appearance is not yet sure). In any
event, CIA sources and methods are to be protected.

We noted that CIA was a source for other types of
reporting, but not constituting as firm evidence. The
HSCA approach to private citizens who had been reported
as saying. things about Oswald--without being operationally
connected with CIA--permitted direct evidence from then,
without reference to.CIA. He agreed in this, although —
he.did not state what witnesses in this category he
may use. , : .

; Blakey asked if photographs could be used to show
witnesses. They would be CIA surveillance photographs.
He thought they could be cropped, noting that others .

He asked if actual transcripts of telephone
conversations could be used. He spoke of techniques |
of cross-examination to get witnesses to acknowledge
or recall things they otherwise would not or had not
testified to. We made *the point that it probably.
would be very clear what the source was. Shepanek
pointed out that this would be equivalent to acknowledge-
ment of the teltap operations--implied confirmation.

‘Hawkins pointed out the extreme sensitivity of Mexican

officialdom to this publicity, in addition to its exposure
of an operational activity that continues.

We expressed pessimism about agreement, to this, but
undertook to study it upon receipt of the transcripts
the Committee wants to use. .
