TOP SECRET - SENSITIVE

 

 

to indicate a second purpose of @RRIFLE , probably, the estab-

lishment of an assassination Sar nd perhaps even a
“*plan to use one agent , Ese : ankele\(QUJWIN), in an
“assassination attempt in the Congo. I refer specifically to

documents summarized, in Tab C, at paragraph 11, page 4; para-

graph 24, page 7; paragraph 2, page 8; paragraph 1, page 9;
paragraph 3, page .

I definitely feel we should obtain copies of the .
documents underlined above, as well as one which indicates
some ZRRIFLE activity in the Miami area, summarized at para-
graph 4, page 9, Tab C. Also, we should obtain a copy of the
document, referred to above, in which McCone advocated that
dissident Cubans bring about "the eventual liquidation of the
Castro/communist entourage." I have prepared a letter for
your signature requesting them, attached hereto.
