BEYERS is married to a sister of JOHN PAUL SPICA,
an ex-convict involved several years ago in the HYZAK murder,
and hasseveral children, BEYERS drives two different auto-
mobiles, including a 1972 or 1973 skyblue four-door Chevrolet
with dark blue vinyl top and a 1973 Oldswobile two<door or
four-door sedan, gray~brown with light cream vinyl top. BEYERS
gives the appearance of a successful jewelry businessman, He
is believed to be engaged in contacting customers for Raiffee
Yending Co. equipment.

Informant has not had any contact with BEYERS in
any way whatsoever for the past month or more, Most recently,
| BEYERS was talking about pulling a burglary at the Hollander
: Galleries, St. Louis County, where there are more than $260,000
| worth of paintings stored, Reportedly, BEYERS has been are
rested many times, BEYERS adising informant that he had a
"long Hoover sheet",

 

- Informant advised he will immediately furnish any
: additional information received concerning these matters,

SL 13716185

At about that same time, informant recalled that
BEYERS inquired as.tc whether. he knew anyone by the name
of EUGENE ZIGLER who lives somewhere in West St. Louis
County. BEYERS referred to him as an old man, believed
by him to have stolen some paintings in Florida, BEYERS
said he intended to find out whether the man had the paint-
ings and if so, he intended to have them stolen from him,

About one month pricr to the date of the reported
burglary of the Jefferson Memorial, St. Louis, in which sev-
eral items of Lindbergh trophies were taken, exact date not
recalled, BEYERS came to his shop asking him if he was in~
terested in buying any articles from the Jefferson Memorial,
commenting specifically that he had.in mind seme "“commemora
tive pieces" that were included in the Lindbergh trophies,
Informant said he told him this would be “too hot to handis"
whereupon BEYERS said they could be used to "set up enemies"
by "stashing them in the trunk of somebody's car", Informant
said he told BEYERS he was not interested in that kind of.
job since he had been in trouble once (robbery of Four Seasons
Antique Shop} and did not care to get in that kind of troubie
again, Within several days, informant heard the news of the
breakin of the Jefferson Memorial and the theft of several
items there, A day or two after that publicity, BEYERS came
to informant's shop, advising that "now I’ve got my hands

.full - r've got a lot of problems", Informant recalled that

it appeared BEYERS had not shaven for several days, Ordi-
narily, BEYERS is a very conservatiia, well-dressed person,

BEYERS never again mentioned the Jefferson Memorial
items, and he never mentioned same to BEYERS, despite the
recent publicity,

He firmly believes that BEYERS at one time ‘had
both these items and the Norman Rockwell painting and may
still have same, He does not believe that BEYERS would ever
confess to anything, BEYERS having told him on one occasion
that the police would never get anywhere with him since he
absolutely would never talk, even if confronted with informa~
tion from other sources attributed to him. ‘ ,

BEYERS is further déseribed as follows:

known, and he inquired about a smali item in the store
that had been priced at akhout $50, but purchased for $15
in the St. Charles area, He offered to pay $15 for the
item, exhibiting considerable interest in and knowledge
of antiques. He left the store without buying anything,
but within a day or two returned to the store, also meeting
informant, and still having interest in the piece he had
previously looked at. This was the first meeting with in-
formant, This individual brought with him a small pottery
tea set, described as golden brown, with a set of cups and
saucers, pitcher, sugar, and creamer, having a gold~brown
shiny glaze. The set was believed to be worth about $100,
but he offered to sell it for $300. He then identified him~-
self as RUSSELL BEYERS. He is belkved to be a very intelli-
gent, perceptive person. No business was transacted, On
that occasion, however, BEYERS “opened up” with informant,
advising that he is personally represented by Attorney MURRAY
RANDALL (former attorney, USDJ, and former AUSA, EDMO), and
that he and RANDALL are very close personal friends, He said
he had inguired of an individual at OK Novelty Co., St. Lowis,
alse inguiring of informant as to “what kind ef guy" was the
informant. He said he had learned that he could taik to
informant, advising further that it was his understanding
that informant was not a "snitch", He also advised that he
had personally sent the aforementioned black couple inte
informant's shop to “have him knocked off", but that after
learning that he could be trusted, he had advised the black

+ couple against taking anything from him. He asserted that
if there was anything in St. Louis that informant wanted to
buy, he would have it stolen and seil it to him at the right
price, He came into inf@mantts shop at ieast once or twice
for the next several wekks, and shortly after the aforemen-
tioned second meeting in the shop, BEYERS told informant that
he had a painting recently stolen, referring to it as the
"Norman Rockwell", we said he intended "to have it on ice",
but would sell it to informant for $5,000. Informant advised
he personally contacted his lawyer, inquiring as to whether
it would be feasible to buy the painting and sell it to an
insuran@ company, Reportedly, this lawyer, not identified
by informant, made some inguiries and found that the involved
insurance company was not interested in paying that amount

for same. A few days later, BEYERS again came to the shop
offering to sell the painting for $3,000, and then made

a final offer to sell it for $2,000, BEYERS then said that
the painting was “going into cold storage", BEYERS has
hever again mentioned this painting. .

x

During the fall of 1973, five or six menths ago,
date not recalled, BEYERS came to the shop inquiring es to
whether they could get together to talk, and they later did
so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, Mo., in the area of a Broii=
Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled on business,
BEYERS talked freely about himself and his business, and
they later went to informant's house where BEYERS told a story
about visiting a lawyer in St. Louis County, now deceased,
not further identified, who had offered to give him a contract
to kill MARTIN LUTHER KING. He said that aiso present was a
short, stocky man, who walked with a limp. (Later, with 2=
gard to the latter individual, BEYERS commented that this
man was actually the individual who made the payoff cf JAMES
EARL RAY after the killing.) BEYERS said he had declined to
accept this contract. He did remark thutthis lawyer had
Confederate flags and cther items about the house that might

indicate that he was "a real rebel", BEYERS also commented
that he had been offered either $16,000 or $20,000 to Kild

KING. —

Sometime later, informant talked to JOSEPH "JO 00"
OLIVESTRO, a. known fence, with whom he is acquainted. This
individual advised informant that BEYERS truly is a "very
treacherous guy", cautioning him to stay away from him if
he wanted to stay out of trauble.

About two or three months ago, BEYERS telephoned
him at 7:00 on aight, probably a Monday night, date not .re-
called, advising that he was going te kill 2,North St. peouas
man, indicating that the man had "snitched. GE guns". said
BEYERS could have said that the man had vsnitened O?-drugs",
At 10:00 P.M, the same night, BEYERS again called him, ad=
vising that "the job is done", The next day, informant read
about a man being killed at his home or in front of his house
in North St. Louis, further details not recalled.
