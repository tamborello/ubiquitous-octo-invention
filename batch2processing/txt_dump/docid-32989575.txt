The Honorable Edward H. Levi
Attorney General of the United States
United States Department of Justice
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

It has come to the attention of the Senate
Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations
with.Respect to Intelligence Activities that on
February 2, 1976 the Department of Justice turned
over to plaintiffs in the Hampton v, City of Chi-
cago case certain Justice Department and FBI docu-
ments.

The Select Committee believes these documents
may be relevant to its investigation of the FBI's
role in the December 4, 1969 raid, and for this
reason I now request that these documents be sent
to the Select Committee.

 

Your promptest attention to this document
request will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Chairman

Mr. Gerald Warren
Editor
San Diego Union : "ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED.

P.O, Box 191 : HEREIN | LASSIFIE
’ San Diego, California 92112 . nel /O ERM YO

Dear Mr. Warren:

 

I was surprised to read the article entitled “Report Due on-
FBI Probe" which appeared on the front page of the San Diego Union
of January 27, 1976. The article contained statements attributed
to me which were false. I regret to say that I feel. this inaccu-
. fate reporting was done intentionally by your reporter, Mr. Dillon,
in a brazen attempt to buttress his earlier articles about the SAO.
Specifically, Dillon's article states:
"Madigan said his four-day visit to California has
confirmed most news reports about FBI involvement
with the SAO's guerrilla war against political
dissidents in San Diego during the early 1970's.
His article goes on to say:

"The FBI was ‘very much involved! with the Secret Army
Organization, a Senate investigator said here yesterday
after interviewing the SAO co-founder and former FBI
informant Howard Berry Godfrey."

Both of these statements attributed to me are false. I never made
such statements to Dillon or anyone else. To the contrary, what
few things I did say to Dillon were almost the opposite. More
particularly, I asked him where the evidence was for the statement
reported in his January 11, 1976 article which claimed that the FBI
“created a group known as the Secret Army Organization... ." I

told Dillon that our investigation had uncovered no such evidence.

With a sheepish smile, Dillon implied that he knew of no evidence

of the FBI's involvement with its informer Godfrey does not present
a pleasant picture, I now feel compelled to state publicly that,
in ny opinion, the San Diego Union articles by Mr. Dillon have
presented an exaggerated picture of ‘what really happened.

: . As I indicated in my telephone conversation on January 30,

1976 with Mr. McArthur of your newspaper, I am 1 requesting that

you print this letter as testimony of your newspaper's sense of

 

fair play, honesty and accurate reporting; a sense which your
_ reporter lacked. The people-of San Diego are entitled to no less.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mike:

Regarding the Select Committee's investigation
of the Secret Army Organization activities in relation
to the FBI in the San Diego area, the Committee requests
that a member of its staff be given access to the original
materials maintained at the San Diego field office of the
FBI. Such access should be initially to copies at FBI
headquarters, as previously arranged, and subsequently to
the originals at the field office. .

In addition, I thought that the Justice Depart-
ment and the FBI might be interested in the attached copy
of a letter from Committee counsel Michael J. Madigan to
the editor of the San Diego Union.
