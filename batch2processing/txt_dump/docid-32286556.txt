Re: Havana 92-1 10/20/59

* _Hav-33 reported that on August 21, 1959, at the Casino
Capri HENRY SAAVEDRA, SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JOHN WILLIAMS (Boston Top
Hoodlum), his brother ANTHONY WILLIAMS, and ANGELO DE CRISTOFARO
were talking about opening the Casino del Rio, which is on the road
to the Havana Airport of Rancho Boyeros, HAV-33 also reported
there was some discussion regarding the possibility of TRAFFICANTE's
opening the Oriental Park Race Track in Marianao; however, the :
"Havana Post", and several other public sources, announced on
September 23, 1959, that DAN CHAPPELL, described as a former .
President of the Florida State Breeders Association and one-time -
candidate for Florida State Governorship, planned to invest
$1,500,000 in Oriental Park, and newspapers officially announced
on October 7, 1959, that DAN CHAPPELL signed a 15-year contract a
on the previous day for the operation of Oriental Park. There
has been no indication that TRAFFICANTE is in any way connected
with the same, and HAV-33 has been unable to develop any informa-
tion indicating any interest of TRAFFICANTE in the race track.

 

On September 5, 1959, HAV~33 reported SANTO TRAFFICANTE betes
was in the casino of the Hotel Comodoro talking with his manager, :
BENNY FERNANDEZ, and SAMMY MONDELO. These two individuals are

described by informant as being from Tampa, Florida, and are ;
very much in the confidence of subject.

On September 15, 1959, informant reported that at the t
casino of the Hotel Capri TRAFFICANTE was present with HENRY
SAAVEDRA, MARVIN KRAUSE, ANGELO DE CRISTOFARO, and numerous other
gamblers, including JOHN WILLIAMS. Informant mentioned that one
of the important American gamblers who left Cuba because he was"
afraid of deportation was CHARLES WHITE, aka Charles Tourine,

A Cuban friend advised informant he had heard from TOURINE in
Europe, at which time TOURINE was inquiring regarding the gam-
bling situation in Cuba and the possibilities of returning,

Through October 5, 1959, nothing of any significance
regarding activities or movements of SANTO TRAFFICANTE was reported,
although his presence in Havana continued to be noted, It has 3
continued to be uniformly reported by HAV-33 and various other ‘

-sources, and it has been noted by personal observation, that the

gambling business-is very poor at this time and almost no American
tourists are observed in the various gambling casinos in Havana,

Sufficient copies of this letter are furnished for the . i
information of Albany, Miami, and New York,
