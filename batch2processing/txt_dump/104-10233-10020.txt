MEMORANDUM FOR: Passavoy ~
SUBJECT : Carlos Bandin and Alberto Junco

. rc

1. It has come to our attention that Miro has been
attempting to arrange a meeting with Carios Bandin, a
MRR faction leader. Rumor has it that Hiro is disturbed
by the attitude of that MRR Group represented by Guillot,
Caesar Baro and Dr. Lasaga which ia Presently affiliated
with the CRC, Miro should know that the Guidilot Group
is very effective operationally. We intend to gupport
this group as one of the very few capable groups presently
functioning. We have had experience with Bandin and his
group. Our findings were that the group is insecure,
dishonest and too competitive to deserve support,

2. For the past six months we have Waited for the
MDC to enter the fight actively. They have not. Alberto
Junco, one of our agents, ciaims a large MDC following
"inside" ond has been pressing for support. We directed
him to Miro. Junco claims his approach to the CRC was
Unproductive. Does Miro intend to continue the "do nothing"
Lucas faction? How does he regard Junco?

3. Yt will be appreciated i7 these matters are dis-

cugsed with Hiro. An indication of hig reaction will,
likewise, be appreciated, .
