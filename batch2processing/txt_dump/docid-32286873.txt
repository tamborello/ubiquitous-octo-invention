The Recorder of Deeds Office, in addition, on
12/28/61 reflected that MAX and BETTY EDER executed a
mortgage on the above property to the Washington Federal
Savings and Loan Association, Miami Beach, Fla., in the
amount of $28,000.00 on 12/19/61, which was filed and
recorded 12/20/61. ‘

MM 509-C, on 12/26/61, advised that JOSEPH
‘ INDELICATO (Miami file 92-404) has returned to the Patio
Bridge Club, Miami Beach, after a long absence and is again -
playing cards and shylocking out of that club.

DANIEL SULLIVAN, Operating Manager of the Crime
Commission of Greater Miami, on 12/28/61 advised he heard
Puccini's Restaurant, Miami, Fla., opened on 12/25/61 and
so far has complied with all the requests and licenses of
the City of Miami. JOE FISCHETTI (Miami file 92-99) has
an interest in this establishment. SULLIVAN stated FISCHETTI
and his associates remodeled two small buildings into one,
which adjoins the property of the restaurant, and apparently
intended to use it for a gambling setup. The ,City of Miami
made them tear down part of the new panel walls which
covered over the windows and make other corrections, as
well as securing a promise that these premises will be used
for no other purpose other than a residence for the manager.
SULLIVAN commented that this building, before the corrections
were made, hdd about 1000 feet of floor space, had newly ;
paneled walls throughout, four air conditioners, a ceiling
fan, a large pool table was in the center of the room, which
room had a plush red carpet, a men's and women's wash room,
and the two doors had three locks apiece on them.
