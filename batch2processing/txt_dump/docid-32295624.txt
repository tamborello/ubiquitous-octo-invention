advised he was traveling to Chicago and would give the source
the stamps for perusal. Source stated he would have his
business partner, the UCSA, look at the stamps and establish
their value. The next meeting was scheduled for Monday,
12/13/76.

Consensual monitoring of the telephone conversations
with MC KINNEY was obtained through SAC, Chicago authority
and with the consent of the Chicago Strike Force.

: The San Antonio Division is establishing a criminal
background for the UCSA at Del Rio, Texas, through FBI National
Academy established liaison. The El Paso Division will also
establish a criminal background and has suggested an entry for
the UCSA into the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) Drug
Enforcement Agency computer. The UCSA will have a background in
minimal narcotics suspicion arrests and would normally have an
entry in the computer especially since he is a pilot. The
EPIC entry could be discreetly covered to identify anyone who
makes inquiry of the computer information. All arrest finger-
print cards will be furnished to FBI. HQ when gathered at Chicago.
