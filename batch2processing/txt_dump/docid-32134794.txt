DN 2h9-c frequ ented Clover Bar we xt door to Sherman Hotel ’
Chicago, Illinois, 1946 to 1949. He described’ this bar-as a hgngout |
for the hoodlum element. At that time it was operated by IRA/COLITZ i
who was described as a personal friend of Colonel JACOBPARVEY y & wel 7
known Chicago political figure. COLITZ possibly was récéntly a _
candidate for Alderman in Chicago and resides in penthouse apartment.
on Michigan Boulevard.

The informant related JACK RUBY, whom he identified from
newspaper photographs, frequented the Clover Bar in about 1946 or
1947 and was an acquaintance of IRA COLITZ and possibly wes a former
school mate of COLITZ on the west side of Chicago. He does not know .
the nature of RUBY's activities in Chicago. oo, :

The informant stated that in about December, 19h9 » he was
in Dali.as, Texas, at which time, RUBY was operating a night club,
name unknown, with western band end western motif. The informant
visited this club and chatted briefly with RUBY who requested that
he convey RUBY's regards to COLITE when the informant returned to
Chicago.

The informant has not seen or heard from RUBY since 1949
and has never hed any specific information concerning RUBY's back-
ground or activities but has never had any reason to suspect him
of being inve:2ved in subversive activities.

11/26/63, CG 6498-PC advised that he had solicited information from
politicians of the 2lth Ward, the former voting residence of RUBY.

PC advised that he talked to two persons who appeared to know RUBY
from many years ago. They advised that: RUBY was never anything but
“a punk” and never had any hoodlum connections or associations. One
person advised that he recalls that RUBY attempted to sneak into a
prize fight in Chicago, believed to be the second DEMPSEY - TUNNEY
fight, and was ceught by a police officer who beat him over the head .
with his night stick. As a result of this beating, RUBY now has a
plate in his head. Apparently this causes pressure when RUBY becomes
excited and causes RUBY to act emotionelly.
