MENGRANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

' SUBJECT : Permanent Residence in the United States

for Vladimir RODRIGUEZ LaHera under
Provisions of Section 7 of the CIA Act
of 1949, as Amended,

1. It is recommended that Vladiniir RODRIGUEZ LaHera
be granted permanent residence in the United States under
Section 7 of Public Law 110. Subject’s family is not
included as they have entered the United States under
normal immigration procedures,

2, This action is deemed essential to the support
of the Cuban diplomatic and intelligence defector effort
and to retain the services of an individual able to be
of assistance in psychological warfare and political action

assignments.

3. Subject has been utilized by CIA since his de~
fection in April 1964. He has provided voluminous, accurate,
and valuable information on the organization of the Cuban
intelligence services, their operations, staff members,
and agents, Ee has been, is being, and will continue to
be used to effect recruitments and defections of nembers of
the Cuban intelligence and diplomatic services, He desires
to settle permanently in the U.S, and has been assured
this would be possible. His value to us will continue to
be considerable as a fluent spokesman for the anti-Castro
cause and in serving as a means of approach to high level
targets in the Cuban Government, particularly those in the
diplomatic and intelligence services. If Subject is not
assisted in his express desire fox permanent residence in
the U.S., this will immeasurably increase the difficulty in
encouraging other high level recruitments and defections
as Subject will provide living proof that CIA is not truste
worthy or is powerless to assist those who cooperate with
and depend upon us.

+ 4. Subject has ‘never been a merber of the Communist
Party. lowever, he is ineligible for an immigrant visa
ase to his service in the General Directorate of Intelligence,

the Cuban external intelligence service.
