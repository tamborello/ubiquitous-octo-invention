MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Special Group Meeting - Cuba

Special Vroup

Here is some miscellaneous information with regard to your Special Group
meeting this afternoon on Cuba.

6 . 1. Artime Cut-off - As you know, State is pressing toycut off Artime, large’.
because of his recent irresponsible activity. CIA opposes State on this one
for the usual reasons. DOD, reportedly, will also-'take a somewhat reluc-
tant line on cutting off Artime. Vance may express the view that a cutoff
will drive Artime up the wall and that he will go off and do something that
could cause us real trouble vis-a-vis our present conflict with the East.

For eximple, he might go off and sink a Soviet ship. DOD would probably

prefer that we phase him out slowly and keep 2 dialogue going over the cours

of the next few months. The advantage of this would be twofold - First, it

would keep Artime quiet; second, his residual power to hurt us, when we
“finally do cut him off, will be yeduced.

On this one, ‘Iam inclined towards the DOD view.

I don't like this one either.

3, Support to RECE - One question which will arise today is whether or not:
start giving some low-risk support to RECE. While State and DOD, at the
working levels, originally were in favor of it, they seem to. have changed th:
position. One reason - some of the arguments which are spelled out in the

Mr. Bundy , -2-  ° ’ March 4, 1965

attached memo on the subject. Another reason - State does not want to com- —
promise its position on Artime (i.e., Lf you give aid to RECE, how can you st.
aid to Artime?).

State and DOD will probably propose that, in turning dowh RECE, we give
them $17,000. The RECE people apparently had to tap 4 program fund of
its small contributors to keep going administratively over the last couple
months when Bosch cut them off; they want to return this money to the
small contributors. Arguments in favor of giving them the money are:

(a) it will lessen the shock of giving RECE a negative reply, (b) they will
not look bad among the exiles (we don't want them to look bad because they
are "good guys"), and (c) part of RECE's problem has not bgen their fault.
We have not been able to give RECE as prompt an answer as we would have
liked. :

I continue to be in favor of not getting involved with RECE; lagree that

$17, 000 is a small price to pay for a kiss-off.

4. Keating Gimmick - Both DOD and State are cold to the idea of having

Keating (l understand this now may be changed to Donovan) stir up trouble
between the Soviets and the Cubans. DOD feels that such goings-on might
be interpreted as some sort of Vietnam play. State feels that such a man

_ wouldn't get received at a high level; also, there are other ways to do the

job if it needs doing.

While I admire CIA's ingenuity and I sincerely think we should keep them
jnvention-minded, I must say that this one sounds like a Rube Goldberg con-

traption, Iam against it.

5. ClAts Paramilitary Capability - Both DOD and State will probably oppose
CIA's proposal to drop its paramilitary capability. lagree with State and DOP
that, with the present world situation as it stands, this is a good capability

to keep on hand if we possibly can. I would agree to an abandonment of this
capability only if it were demonstrated that we could crank it up again ina
very short space of time.
