eriere? by her doctors and an operetion nay be necessary In early 1964, \
It is therefore unlikely that she will be able to work during the coming

project year. Station does not plan to request cancellation of her operational
clearance at this time, but has not included salary payments to her in the 4
estizated costs of the project for the coming year. : .

 

be

The unusual salary inerease reflected for LIEMPTY-19 In the "Project Costs",
(velow) sectionfor the coming yenr is due to this anent's new duties of LIFEAT
processing in addition to her old duties as translator. Agent's OA was amended —
for this use on 2 January 1963. _
EFDROTIVGNESS. '

The comments mide concerning the project's ctfectiveness in the Projéct
Renewal of 1960 (HMMA 15979) vemain valid, Inieed the Station's neal for the
tyve of services provided by the assats of this project are at lenst as great
togey as they were when those comments vere orisinally forwanled.

PROBLEMS
There are presently no know majer problems facing the operation which vould

artees elther the sceurity or the ctrecviveness of this operation, The sceurity

protien racing the LICALLA portion of the operation ani deseribed in HMMA-15979

and subsequent renewal requests has been vesolved by the Cuban Government's release

of three KURIO? personnel enriter this year. As was noted previously, one of

this sroup had knowledge of the LICALLA operation.

Both SCANTLING and GERSNDE took the LCYLUTTER during the month of October
1065, No security problems were revealed by this test.

 

Tre Station considers that the project is operating at its optimum size and
does mot plan to expend it during the coming; year. Efforts will be continued to
refine ani better utilise the existing oroject organization and to Lmeprove ‘the
eomparimentation and security of the project.

$US 10,300 will be expended during the last two months of the project year.

Me Support of Lhe sencitive AMROD operatton, in which Raymond He
GUWNDE also played a vital role, was of strynlar importance to
the suecest of the overatton. SCANTLING's many fields of op-
erallonal experlenee “ere drawn on fully and ke thereby provided
a unbaie contribuiioan to the aperatton. Without the acsistance
ot GCANTLING and GAR NDE with their wilque qualitleations, this t
operation would have been difficult in the extreme Lf Indeed at

all possible.

2. "Po eclleet operationnl infomation ant identify opernttonal leads

handlod by GERVNDE, ts still the major contributor to this objective.

LIENTRAP operational enpiinsis centinuar to renin in the area of ‘phote stakeaut
of prominent Mexican Couruutists and is presently working Oulltime on previding—-
pictures of imilvidual Coarnnists, homes suspected of being meeling sites used
by the Comajunist Party and the Communist Party Heuiqguarters itself. LISNTRAP
has also reeently besun to be used on IRKNICK leads. It is expeeted that

ack tivities of bIeNiRAP in that latter area will expand in the coming year..

  

3. “Po provide operntional supgort to Station eperations ineluding the
reatlag of hotel rooms and sate ppartments, renting and servicing of post oftice
boxes, oni conducting counterssurvetllanecs." GERINDS'’s contribution to the
AMROD operntion was noted in parmmph T.A.3.n. above. GSRENDE'S compre
area knowkLedine and personal operntional capabtlittes enable him to mike a
valuable contribution tn cuc pernttons as AMHOD ant also enable him to orocure

re

   

 

 
 
  

 

    
   

   

 

the most destreabla rave sites tn support of Lhe Stailos operntions. The
project's musets, particularly GARENDs! int LIPMP’Y-10, presently provide 3c
‘

post orilee oun mail drops for use of Mexico City Sration and other Stations.

Althourh Lt {3 nlenned to reiuce this number considerably during the next sear,
(s inee other Gtatlon assets now can provide a number os Live nccommodat tan
addresses), 2 rember of vost offlee ‘bexts whil be retained for use in Suture

operat Long.”

The quality and quantity of operational inverwtion produced by the
photomrannic baces aml other activities under GERSNDE's control and mupervision
is constderea by the Siation worthwhile and in some cases unique. It is eon-
eluied, therefore, thas this suvment of the LEEMPTY -Profjeet shoull be continued.
