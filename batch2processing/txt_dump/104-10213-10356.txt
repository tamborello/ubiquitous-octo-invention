system at the time of President Kennedy's assassination.
One was a master 201 index card, one was an FBI report
classified (filed) into 100-300-011 and one was an FBT
report classified into 74-500. Both of these files are:
"Subject" files.

a. The file 100-300-011 is entitled “Fair
Play for Cuba Committee". It consists of 987
documents dated from 1958 through 1973. All but
approximately 20 are third agency (FBI, State,
etc.) documents. .

b. The file 74-500 is entitled "USSR Miscella-* _
neous”. The file consists of 427 documents, 90% of -—*
which are third agency documents. The documents :
cover the period 1948 through 1977.

(NOTE: A machine listing for the 100-300-011 file was
reviewed by HSCA Staff Member Betsy Wolf in May 1978).

SUBJECT: DDO Response to HSCA Letter dated 15 August 1978
(Questions 1 § 2)

1. In June 1960 a new form 831 (for opening 201's)
came into effect which made the old (Oct. 57) type form
used in the Oswald 201 obsolete. Since 201's are opened
by the individual offices and not a central point, the
Records Integration Division allowed for an overlap period
before not accepting the October 57 form 831's. The June
1960 form was obviously geared for machine input and
specifically has spaces for the machine codes. The
analyst (initials N.S.) who reviewed the 831 form on
Oswald and assigned the 201 number added the machine
codes to the old type opening sheet.

a. The OI Code (Other Identification) "AG"
means “actual or potential defectors to the East
or the SINO/SOVIET Bloc including Cuba". The
analyst added this O01 Code because CI/SIG (Egerter)
had stated that Oswald had defected to the USSR
in October 1959. Any person who could be described
as the above could have an OI Code "AG".

b. CI/SIG has been crossed out because the
space now required a machine code (as explained
in Paragraph 1 above). The number "731" is called
a "*non-country code" which means in machine input
language CI/SI (the office which had opened the
201 file)v

c. The number "074" is under Category #10°*
“Country of Residence", not "047" under Category
#12 "Second Country Interest", as stated in HSCA
letter of 15 August 1978. The number "074" is a
“country code" and means the USSR.

(NOTE: The machine codes in Paragraph la, b, & c were

Gbtdined from a Machine Listing produced by IMS/Procedures
Branch/EDIS (Electronic Data Input Section). It is a
computer listing to identify computer fields. The IMS
Analysts also have handbooks entitled "Handbook for
Analysis" which specifies this same information).
