On September 22, 1960, under Registry No. 38175
in Book 3, Volume 491, Page 74, No. 74, the capital of this
firm was increased to $500,000 pesos ($40,000.U.S.) A
meeting of the following stockholders was held at the address
Anatole France 71-501 on September 12, 1961:

EDWIN JOHN RYAN (McLAUGHLIN)
FERNANDO SCHROM MENDOZA

Lic. (Atty.) ALFONSO DE GARAY, JR.
Lic. (Atty. ) HAYDEE CRUZ OLIVA
Lic. (Atty. ) ARMANDO AMEZAGA ALVARADO

 

At this meeting, RYAN represented 300 shares, DeGARY
100, SCHROM 20, CRUZ OLIVA 30 and AMEZAGA 50 -- total 500 shares.

A second confidential source abread, who is unavailable
to testify or furnish a deposition and who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised on August 12, 1963, as follows:

The records of the Mexican Immigration Service reflect
that shortly after the incorporation of the Cia. Azteca de
Administracion, S.A., on April 20, 1960, a series of letters
was directed to the Mexican Immigration Service by this company
in an effort to obtain authorization for STEWART B. HOPPS to
assume charge of the conmipany. After several refusals, said
authorization was finally granted on June 13, 1961, but
apparently HOPPS did not enter Mexico as the Mexican Government
files fail to reflect any further action in this connection.

These same Mexican Government files reflect that JOHN
M. KEARNEY (CLEARY) was born March 20, 1895, at La Plata,
Maryland, and entered Mexico at Nuevo Laredo on October 20,
1920, and was engaged for many years at Veracruz and vicinity
as an employee of o11 companies (not specified). He is married
to MARIA TERESA NOLAN and he became a Mexican citizen on .
April 20, 1945.

The records of the Visa Section of the American
Embassy reflect that JOHN KEARNEY (CLEARY), Mexican citizen,
born March 20, 1895, at La Plata, Maryland, with residence
at Rio Tamesis #3, Mexico City, was issued visas on January 3,
1961, and December 26, 1962. He has an unlimited visa to
travel to the United States until December 26, 1963. Efforts
