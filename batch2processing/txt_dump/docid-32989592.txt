Re: ROBERT AMORY, JR. at
116-362245 fay

Gone tions in the Middle Hast, It has been productive in the past.
In view of the fact that United Nations is not now.in, session it is
believed that we can affor © discontinue chis coverase at this time
because information it might produce would probably be of less value

than that we may obtain from coverage of Amory. (€)

ACTION:

If you approve, the attached letter will be delivered to
the AG by Assistant Director Evans to secure authority for technical
surveillance on Amory's residence: (¢)

of the President. The President expressed personal interest in
receiving information concerning the current relationship between
Mr. Amory fand representatives of (ESL) Cc Bo

(J

y. Amory's position and his access to many high-level.
