wine and women - not necessarily in that order. He never saw LHO
on liberty, but adds he never looked for him, either. Doesn't recall
anyone ever mentioning anything about LHO on liberty.

Doesn't remember the other four men in their cubicle,
but there were regular changes anyway. Does recall LHO shooting him-
self. Knows he did because when he (Augg) arrived, there was LHO-
sitting on his (augg's) sack with a corpsman treating the arm wound.
He'd used his own "QQ" (Derringer pistol). It was still right there.
LHO said he shot himself. Didn't say why and Augg didn't. ask -
figured like the rest, LHO just didn't want to go on maneuvers in
the Philippines. “Asked if he could have wanted to remain at Atsugi
for a woman, Augg didn't know about that, but knew he resented author-
ity - all kinds and maneuvers were nothing but an exercise and just
that as far as he was concerned. Once he and LHO were on a detail
relative to securing the area due to reports of an incoming hurricane
which put him and LHO together for a period of time during which LHO
complained bitterly about authority and those being subjected to it.

Anyway, when they took LHO to sick bay for gunshot treat-
ment, that was the last time Augg (knowingly) saw him. He adds that
he was put on 30 days mess (duty) when they arrived at Corregidor
which was part of the sentence from the summary (court martial) from
the incident with the Captain. John Wayne stopped by on tour and
he and several others had pictures taken with the movie star. Later,
he saw photos of Wayne with his outfit and LHO was in the background
of one, butugg says he wasn't aware they were on mess at the same

time, notwithstanding. This was about 5/58 - not long after they -

arrived from Japan.

Generally, Augg described LHO as a regular’ man in
the outfit, inclined to be quiet, neat and clean (his sack, foot-
locker and. wall locker were always in good order. and located over
or alongside Augg's). To tell the truth, if he hadn't of shot him-
self, he wouldn't of rememberd him at all. .

He never showed any signs of having any more money
than anyone else.

His defection news came as a surprise.

Never had occasion to appraise his ability as a radar
Operator. Never heard any complaints in that regard and that's all
he probably would of remembered.

No information about what, if any, mail LHO received.

The name Martin Schrand sounds familiar. He vaguely
recalls the shooting on guard duty. He has no information on the
details - didn't know much then. He stood guard like everyone else,
but never had a problem. Never heard anything to link LHO with |
the shooting.

Doesn't know if LHO had a camera, was any kind of a
marksman and never heard anything concerning. any effeminate boys
around any base.

Thinks he shot JFK for reasons related to Cuba. Based
this on his reading "Legend".

Anyone of the guys could of taken photos of the W-2,
but no one did. They were told it was a weather plane and let it go at

that. Recalls two names: PFC John Radley and Cpl. Crawley.»

Interview: Mr. Augg recalls serving in U.S.M.C. with Lee Harvey ©

- Oswald, but not too many details. Somewhat of an effort inasmuch.

 

Sas he's not feeling well today: Got out of bed this evening “to speak
to me, but complained of "stomach pains" and within an hour and ten
minutes, indicated he was going back to bed. No conversationalist,
his replies were largely limited to one word answers, but he managed

to convey the following information:

 

He enlisted in the USMC 5-21-56. He was discharged
5-8-59. Met LHO in Atsuki (3apan) when the latter was sent there
some months after he (Augg) arrived. Housing consisted of a large
barracks divided into cubicles - six to a section and LHO "sacked" -
(bunked) in his cubicle - directly over him for that matter.

Although LHO didn't talk much, he talked to Augg and
found they had something in common. LHO followed Augg through

Radar/radio training at Kessler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi,

 

and, like Augg, was sent directly to Atsugi as an operator. Augg
doesn't recall what most of the guys thought of LHO, but he got along

with him. Once, he borrowed $2.00 from LHO. (About a year ago, “a guy"

came to Augg's home and interviewed him relative to that publication
"Legend." Later, he received a copy in the mail and found he's men-
tioned). Says he's read the story (Legend) describing LHO being
thrown in the shower. He doesn't recall anything like that.

Even he didn't have much in common with Lee Harvey
oswald- he didn't drink or play cards ("we played some poker -
not much 'cause there wasn't much money — but. mostly pinochle was
our main game). If LHO had any special interest in girls, it didn't
show. His thing was reading, not girlie magazines, put heavy stuff.
Augg assumed everything was in English. He wasn't aware LHO knew
anything else.

But they were both Privates .(Augg had enjoyed the PFC
promotion, but an indiscretion involving. a Captain cancelled that) and
were assigned to the same radar crew. Eight or nine men working to-
gether: 4 hours on, 8 off. Asked if this group's nickname was
"coffee mill" he said no - that was a call letter.

Recollection of dates is vague, but he arrived in
Atsugi around May, 1957 and LHO made it there in 1957 too, but a
few months later. Although T returned to their meeting, he couldn't
remember if LHO arrived alone or with a group. He was just another
new guy in the barracks to Augg.

LHO always went on liberty alone which wasn't signi-
ficant in itself. Several of the men did. Augg did if there wasn't
any plan including another man or group. ‘Liberty consisted of going

to Yamada (phonetic) or Yokahama - the two nearby towns — to seek
