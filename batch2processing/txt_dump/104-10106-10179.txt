MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

| Office of General Counsel

SUBJECT: “°° | PDLADLE: Outside Lawyer | to Draw wy Up i

1. PDLADLE is a high-level defector residing in New York who has
had advanced to him a number of large "loans" over the years, in addition
to his "salary." Some of these monies have gone into the purchase of
some real estate in the State of New York. The Agency now wants a
Deed of Trust executed in favor of one of its nominees on the New York

, . ER apparently (accordingly to Eric Sowers) has no objection

" to(Ms (—_leawing up the Deed of Trust;

 

b. another cleared lawyer. The clearance on any such lawyer
would have to be updated by Security. The best candidate
Bill Ashbaugh and I were able to locate off the Cleared Attorneys

c. the case officer for PDLADLE, MONCURE, who is apparently
a practicing N.Y. lawyer who at one time worked for the Agency.
This idea was suggested by Vasia Gmirkin of CI Staff, the
client component on the Deed of Trust. The idea would be that
since MONCURE already knows that PDLADLE and MONCURE
would be used only on this PDLADLE job, the security and cover
problems normally associated with allowing cleared attorneys
to become involved in operations would not be as pronounced as
