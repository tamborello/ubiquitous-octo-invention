CG *92—350

MARCY: He mentioned that.’ I was with him this morning,
at 9:30 (with GIANCANA). I told him, I said,
SAM, if you think you're breaking this guy's
back by making him a Congressman, you got the
wrong impression. He says, I don't care. All
ot I want to do is get him out of the (obs) Ward.
Just one term, and then we'll see,

D! ARCO: Now, what about the pinball machines and what
license?

MARCY: Liquor licenses. Tell him to stop revoking them
. licenses in the County. There's supposed to be
some bill or something the County is coming out
with on pinballs.

Attorney. We ought to have O'BRIEN talk to him.

D* ARCO: ‘Listen, SIMON is close to O'BRIEN, the District |
Lo j
He's closer than CULLERTON was. 7 |

! MARCY: . ‘Yeah, we could let CULLERTON get ahold of O'BRIEN
{ then to SIMON.

| D' ARCO: Was MOE satisfied with the Ward?
\ MARCY: © Yeah, I explained it to hin,

' The reference to MOE is obviously a reference to a
| 4 Chicago top hoodlum SAM GIANCANA. The reference to BERNIE se
NIESTE s a reference to the State Senator by that name.
' 4 Ss noted that NIESTEIN is close assgciate of Chicago
/ hoodlums CHUCKMENGLISH and SAMAENGLISH, 2@-WeT1 as GIANCANA.

The reference ¢t is a reference to ANDY FLANDO, who is
, a minor politician in the Chicago area, known to be a favorite
‘of GIANCANA. The reference to CAIN is a reference to RICHARD.
ACAIN, the Chief Investigator for the Cook County—Sheriff, jee

The reference to GIROLAMI is. a reference to CG 6498-PC.
, As the Bureau has been previously advised, on the last contact
' of GIROLAME he advised the Agent handling him that he understands
that he is “on bad paper" with GIANCANA and that GIANCANA intends
to take his political position away from him, This PCI also
advised that he understands that GIANCANA is "maneuvering" behind
the back of the PCI concerning Alderman AL TOMASO. TOMASO is
a protege of the PCI and was put into the Aldermanship of the ‘
28th Ward by the PCI who is the Ward Committeeman of that ward.
The reference to JOE JAMBRONE is a reference to the secretary
of the 28th Ward regular Democratic organization, who is in
his position through the sufferance of the PCI, The above
conversation obviously confirms the information given \to, the
