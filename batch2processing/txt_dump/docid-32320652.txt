Directo

The purpose of this note is to provide an update on the

| transfer of JFK documents to the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA), and the continuing dialogue between the

) Task Force and the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB).

On 11/3/95, the JFK Task Force is set to transfer more
than 11,380 pages of files reviewed by the House Select Committee
on Assassinations (HSCA) as it examined various conspiracy
theories. The files released at this time include organized
crime figure Carlos Marcello, anti-Castro activist Orlando Bosch
Avila and other persons of interest to the HSCA.

‘ Discussions have continued with the ARRB concerning
postponements of informant true names, symbol numbers and
“singular” information that would identify informants if
disclosed. (The ARRB has upheld the postponement of the numeric
portion of symbol numbers, but not the prefix or suffix or
singular information, for those we appealed to the President ) We
will pursue protection for other symbol: numbers in that manner
and will have to attempt to obtain protection for true names and
singular information. The informant issues are to be addressed
again at the ARRB meeting on 11/13 - 14/95.

The ARRB far, has denied protection for
cooperative citizens whowe identities weré protéé ted at their
sources” who provided i m, under a
confidentiality, but were not informants. A separate memo is
being submitted on the Tatest determination on these issues in

nine specific documents to ascertain if appeal is warranted.
