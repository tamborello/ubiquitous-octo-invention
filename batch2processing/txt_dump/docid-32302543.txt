” The area of Monroeville, Pa., along U. S. Route 22, is now
ial commonly referred to by gamblers from New Kensington, Pa.,

, - and from other sections of Western Pennsylvania as "The Strip."
The reason for this is that much of the highway commerce is made
up of nightclubs and cocktail lounges, usually operated in
connection with a motel. These places have become hangouts and

 

 

 

' ostensibly casual meeting places for racket figures, large and
small, and the MANNARINO underlings and associates are frequenting
these establishments more and more. GABRIEL MANNARINO shows up once
or twice a week, and SAM MANNARINO appears less frequently. Pringipal
among the places visited are the Holiday House, the Town House and \
the Phoenix Motel. - . : we |
