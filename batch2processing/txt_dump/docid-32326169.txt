RE: JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA

63-New

Beverly Hills, California. Matula on local probation and
used to be runner for Babe Mc Coy and Frank Brewster, former
Teamster officials. Matula wants out of Teamsters, is
deathly afraid of being arrested and is. ripe for intensified
interrogation."

"John B, Stevenson, former West Coast attorney for
Teamsters Union, is close associate of Brewster and. Dave Beck.
Stevenson now semi-retired and lives in Honolulu. His office
in Los Angeles is run by attorney Charles K, Hackler whom
Hoffa does not respect. Hackler pays Stevenson $400 monthly
although Stevenson does not work. Stevenson holds approximately
80% of Matula's cash, Stevenson has a boat in Honoluly where
it is suspected that currency may be hidden."

The Bureau has not disseminated any of the information
quoted above to the Department, Therefore, it is desired:
that the informant be reinterviewed immediately to obtain
further specifics with respect to this information. Efforts
should be made to pin down the informant. as to the sources
of his information on all of the above-mentioned points.

As ‘Soon as this has been done, Los Angeles should
incorporate ail information given by.,the informant on these
points (both at the time he mentioned’ ‘them originally and
upon subsequent recontacts) into a letterhead memorandum
suitable for dissemination to the Department. . The letterhead
memorandum should bear the same captionas. this airtel and

‘should be forwarded to the Bureau by cover:airtel. The

identity of the informant should not be revealed therein nor
should he be reférred to as[-__] The additional information
the informant furnishes also should be utilized as the basis
for further investigative leads in this case.

For the information of Los Angeles, the story told
by concerning Matula as set out in Los Angeles airtels
of 9/13/61 and 9/20/61 (LA file 62-4945) is being made available

to the Department, in paraphrased form, by the Bureau. Therefore,

Los Angeles's letterhead memorandum should not include or make
any reference to this information. A copy of the Bureau's
communication to the Department in. this regard is. being forwarded
to Los Angeles separately.
