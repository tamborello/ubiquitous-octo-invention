CG 92-350

i MARCY: ‘Who's the ex-copper you got in your office?
BILL: Oh he’s OK. I got 49% of that detective agency.

No I got this thing. I told that lawyer that
| I know that his man knows the other guy and I
7 told him that I want him. I'11 level with.
MITCH EDELSON is working apparently with the
{ bar association. Doing special work. And I
| think that maybe one of the ambulance chasers
\ wanted to get into my office to find out what
MITCH might have had on him. But anyway we
don't want nobody here on Saturdays.

Here, do you want some more JOHN, after all this
is only money. I don'twant you to sit there
\ and eat your heart out. This is only cash.
(counts out money)
} Following the above, D'ARCO and MARCY discussed el
..,plans for a retirement dinner for ppeaseabolice. Captain RALPH
OXSATANESE. They noted that GIROLAMI had taken two tables for
is dinner, State Senator BERNARD NEISTEIN one, Judge PASQUALE
"BUCK" SORRENTINO one table, and an unknown individual one
table. It is noted that CG 6498-PC has advised that he is
assisting in the organization of this dinner for CATANESE
who is retiring this month and that the dinner is to be held
later this month at the Chateau Royale in Chicago.

 

 

MARCY and D'ARCO then had the following conversation:
| MARCY: JOHN you got to get over this.

D* ARCO: I'm over it PAT. But I was bad there for awhile.
| Then when I saw what this little (obs) did,

{ I wanted to knock his head in. But BUDDY's
(JACOBSON) a goner,

MARCY: But JOHN, you got to start getting around again.
Listen when you get down in Florida you had
better see LOU KOREN. Bum around with him a
little bit. He's a good guy.

 

 

D' ARCO: Does he know what happened?
MARCY: I think he knows something happened but doesn’t

know just what. He asked me if we were all all
right and I told him that we were.
