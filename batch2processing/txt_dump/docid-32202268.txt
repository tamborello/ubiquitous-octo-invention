RE: Interview of Paoitch, former FBI liaison with CIA
May 25, 1975

June 5, 1975

Mr. Papitch was interviewed by John Eliff in the
presence of Burton Wides and myself in Room 607 of the
Carroll Arms for about 4 hours.

He appears to be a reflective, ingenuous, and agreeable
former FBI agent who has a considerable reservoir of ¥
experience and opinion. He was forthcoming and cooperative
but stated firmly that he has considerable concern for Bloc
Intelligence efforts and a great admiration for both the
CIA and the FBI.

@ At the onset, he presented a brief history of the CIA's
relations with the FBI and traced Hoover's suspicions
regarding the CIA -- as well as his aloofness from it --

to a residual resentment which sprang from both Hoover's
innate parochialism and the agency's recruitment of FBI
personnel -- particularly those with Latin American back-
grounds -- in the late '40's and early 'S0's. Papitch
stressed more than once that Hoover was a solitary silent
colossus who had his own sources and contacts and the best
sense of political realities of any official in Washington.

Directed toward the matter of operations, Panpitch
mentioned that the FBI and CIA ordinarly undertook no
joint efforts, and never co-operated on any electronic
surveillance efforts. In this regard, Papitch contrasted
the views of Belmont, whom he lauded, with those of Sullivan
and DeLoach. Papitch also adverted to the difficult "grey"
areas in which there was a confusion or duplication of
jurisdiction with the CIA, and cited specifically the
questions of penetration of foreign embassies and missions
in this country as well as the recruitment of counter
intelligence groups by CIA. (Papitch stated that he often
refused CIA requests for CIA recruitment efforts.)

Papitch reviewed the history of the Riha case
and outlined how confusion led to Hoover's abrupt
decision to terminate liaison with CIA. Papitch
also adverted to CIA's concern in '68 or '69 that
certain of its employees were being recruited by
radical associations and thus CIA sought the assistance
of the FBI.

Papitch also mentioned the following:

1) FBI had a San Juan, Puerto Rico, office as
well as a Mexico City office.

2) An FBI agent went to the Dominican Republic
during the 1965 crisis at President Johnson's ¢
direction to investigate.

3) Many problems arose from CIA's attempts to
recruit Cubans in Miami and several squabbles
@ developed from the conflicting interest of FBI
; and CIA.

4) On occasion CIA gave FBI "products" and "items of
interest" derived from its mail opening operation
in New York City.

5) Without exception, each and every American newsman
in Moscow has been approached and attempted to be
recruited by the KGB.

6) The CIA has provided the FBI information for
criminal prosecutions, but never information which
has tainted prosecutions.

7) Ober asked the FBI if the Bureau objected to the
insertion of an Agency asset in a domestic dissendent
group so that the asset could obtain "credentials"
for further foreign work. (Operation Lodestar)
Papitch agreed but asked for the identity of the
CIA "insertion".

8) In '69 an FBI source/asset went to Italy as a student
although Papitch recommended transfer of the source/
asset to the CIA.

\\ e 9) Papitch has no recollection of Jane Fonda or Robert
° Vesco and only a hazy recollection of notional
Marxist/Leninst groups and CIA funding of a
$2.9 million FBI Operation in New York Cityr(M-1-2
