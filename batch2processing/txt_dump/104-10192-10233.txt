Poland”... Me. ZAKRZEWSKI.'then continiied: that the aid which SOURCE would recoive
would ‘enable him to better devote himself to hia art because financial worries -
would be taken from his mind, "Is not this a straight deal?", Mr. ZAKRZEWSKE
asked, "you help us and we help you, and we know that your help will be worth the
"money". When SOURCE-asked what was meant by "ua" and "we" and what kind of |
"help" he: was expected to offer, Mr. ZAKRIEWSKI cautiously replied that, before
-being more, specific, he would need SOURCE's agreement to the proposition.
| "Please try ‘to understand", Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI sald, "I represent, as you have seen,
the government, and it is part of the deal that details of your mission will be ;
made known.to you the moment we know that you are willing to help." SQURCE then
refused by emphasizing that, as an artist, he folt in ao way competent for the’
mission which doubtlessly will te assigned to him in-Germany. His nerves would
not stand. the strain and, sooner or later, he would fail, and thus ruin himself.
Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI..accepted SOURCE's refusal without the slizhtest.sign of dis~  .
appointment, impatience or anger. He. Listened to SOURCK's words with a friendly

 

 

 

 

,.gmile on his face, and commented that: such a reaction was enly natural and even
reasonable from -@ man like SOURCE, and it was only furthér proof of SOURCE's

inordifiate Intelligence and integrity. He assured SOURCE that there was no

hurry, and important things quite naturally need some time to be carefully thought |

over. . Inviting SOURCE to carefully feconsider the offer, he asked for permission ,
to approach’ the matter a second time in a few weeks, in this occasion, SOURCE 7
should be prepared, after Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI's telephone call, to come to the hotel
"ARISTOL-on ULICA PIERSZEGO MAJA" (First of May Road}, where matters could be

discussed more easily. SOURCE agreed to this arranvement because he was afraid

that, by a flat and uncompromising refusal, he would jeopardize his exit permit. :

The hotel "BRISTOL" was an impressive four-storied building with a tavern
and a night-club,-which had been renovated in 1960. It was patronized by well-to-
‘do members of the intelligentsia and tourists. fle remembered having heard from
fellow members of his painters’ club that the secret police had rented a wing in
one of the upper stories of this hotel. . The rooms, aunber unknown, were said to
be furnished as offices and club rooms.
