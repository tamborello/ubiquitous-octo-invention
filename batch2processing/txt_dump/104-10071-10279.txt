3. How will this affect the, fl ‘operation? ti We are afraid that

MOSEY will be suspected of perticipating in ‘some sort of clandestine

activities ahd that she was rather close to: A. ‘in Erussels for an
extended period of time; that her continuous efforts to recontact A

will most likely not go unnoticed; and that! may become sus speoted™

of having clandestine relationships with MOSBY, causing” ‘him to come under
surveillance. Even if the MVD determines that this relationship is purely
social, | __Al. fwill still have a black mark on his record and possibly
pe prevented ‘from ever going to the West avain. Even if the results of MOSBY's
activities in Moscow are not a5 drastic as outlined above, we fear that
aa a “Jui feel thst the AIS has failed to protect him and the oper ration,
“and he therefore might break contact with uSe

Lee we would appreciate headquarter's comments and views on the above,
