A) Re Watts/Bem telecon, 10 September (MIAMI THX 12584)

B) The meeting took place the morning

of 7 September 1974 in Miami. Joe Merola

telephoned Matt MacYane at his home on

7 September 1974 to pass on this informa-

tion. The telecon was unsolicited by

MacVane, who no longer contacts Merola

per DCD Headquarters instructions. Com

Rebinson flew in from Nassau to meet with

doe Merola and Mike Yamanis (Yamanis is

apparently from Ft. Lauderdale and like

Merola he has close ties to arms dealers

and mercenaries). Robinson plans to meet

again with Merola and Yaman{s after com-

plete financial details have been worked

out in assau. ,

Sipecently has made foreign enquiries into the possibility of hiring

arms dealers, that took place outside of the Bahamas Robinson
stated that he represents elements of the Bay Street merchants

- of: Nassau, and that funds are available for action against the
Bahamfan Government. According to Robinson, his group is looking

. for foreign assistance in the Planning. equipping, and: execution of
a coup against the Government. He said that there are many Bahamians

who are in sympathy with his planned course of action, and that
after full details are worked out and the required funds are set
aside, he will convene another meeting with the foreigners in order
to finalize the appropriate arrangements.
