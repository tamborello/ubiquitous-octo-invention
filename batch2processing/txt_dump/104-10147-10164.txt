MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT : HSCA Interest in Nosenko

of 1. Ray Reardon of the Office of Security has been

7 interviewing Agency employees connected in some way with

| the handling of Nosenko during the period of his confine-
. ment, to see in particular if any drugs had been administered
to him. One employee, Tom Ryan of SE Division, was not
interviewed as he was awaiting interview and deposition by
HSCA personnel; as he was deposed last week Ray and I inter-
viewed him today. In essence, he recalled no such use;
Reardon will do a separate memo on that point.

 

2. We had heard that Ryan had been told that he
might be called to testify at public hearings, and asked
him if he minded telling us what the interests of the
HSCA investigator were. He stated that he was asked about
the treatment of Nosenko, including the question of drugs.
One general question was asked about the question of bona
fides, which he avoided answering by saying that any
answer would have to be a long one, and that what he
felt at different times would be different; the questioner
did not persist.

oi 3. One swallow does not make a spring, but this may
be an indication that the HSCA is now focusing on the treat-
ment of Nosenko, rather than the issue of bona fides. So
far as Ryan is concerned, he is under| |
cover and would be unable to testify at public hearings
without severely complicating his future service. Pea
