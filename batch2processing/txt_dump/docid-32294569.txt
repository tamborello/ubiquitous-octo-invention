"66, °T EXPRESSED °D ISMAY TO WILLS OVER THE DEVELOPMENT:

  

I REMINDED HIM OF OUR COOPERATION. HE SUGGESTED THAT
I FIND A WAY TO TALK TO BURNHAM. WILLS ASKED,
HOWEVER, THAT I NOT LET BURNHAM KNOW I HAD LEARNED
OF THE PNC DEMONSTRATION FROM THE FONMIN'S OFFICE,

Te COMMENT : [4 BRITISH OFFICIAL SOURCE }TOLD ME
THIS MORNING THAT A GUYANESE OFFICIAL AHD REPORTED
THAT WILLS, FOLLOWING HIS INVESTIGATION TRIP, HAD
PALYED UPON BURNHAM’S SUSPICIONS OF "IMPERIALIST"
INVOLVEMENT IN THE CUBANA CRASH, BUT IF WILLS IS
PALYING A DOUBLE GAME, HE IS DOING SO EXTREMELY
CONVINCINGLY. HIS ANGER AT BEING INFORMED OF THE
DEMONSTRATION APPEARED GENUINE. I LEARNED DURING
A MEETING AT MID-DAY WITH BURNHAM THAT THE
DECISIONTO PICKET THE EMBASSY HAD BEEN TAKEN
DURING A PNC PARTY MEETING DURING THE NIGHT.
