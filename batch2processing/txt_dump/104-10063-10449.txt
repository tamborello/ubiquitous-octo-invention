MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

‘SUBJECT: "American Defectors to thé USSR"

1, The attached material was part of a soit file entitled
"American Defectors to the USSR", which was set up by SR /6

‘*. (Support) around 1960 and ma intained by various SR components
‘until ca, 1963, The compilations were derived from a variety

of sources, and contain both classified and overt data,

2. Inthe fall of 1966, the files were turned over to CI —
Staff, In most instances, basic information was then abstracted
for the US Defector Machine Program, In all instances in which :
the material was unique, or represented a valuable collation effort,
it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with
a copy of this memorandum,

3. Itis suggested that any dissemination of this data should
be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MROQ), in -
view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that
disseminations have already been made through the us Defector
Machine Program,
