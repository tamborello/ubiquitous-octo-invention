MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

The Department of Defense has now approved, with some’
modifications, a plan developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
to implement your instructions that renewed attention be given
to the induction of Cuban refugees into the U.S. Armed Forces.

Mental, moral and physical standards will be essentially
those in effect for the induction of. Puerto Ricans, with some
relaxations. These modifications include: lowering the mental
test score to 40 from 62, and no disqualification for dependents
or lack of facility in English.

‘The individuals accepted will be organized into Cuban units
through basic and advanced individual training. At the end of
that time, they will either be selected for special forces training,
integrated into regular units or separated for the convenience of
the government.

It is hoped that as many as 1500 men can meet the reduced

standards. Personally, I am very doubtful that any such figure
can be reached, primarily because of the problem of motivation.
As of 8 June 1961, 4152 Cubans had been interviewed. 734 had been
found acceptable under the old standards, and 122 volunteered for

’ induction into the armed services as follows: 17 Army, 15 Navy,
18 Marine Corps, 72 Air Force. Of the 17 Army inductees, 8 requested
and received discharges at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on 14 June
1962, upon finding that they were not being trained in preparation
for an invasion of Cuba.

Whether the new program.will be more successful remains to

    

   

   
 

be seen.
