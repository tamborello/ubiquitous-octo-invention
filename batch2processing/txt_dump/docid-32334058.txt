York City, these individuals are from Chicago, but :
apparently have worked and are known to jewel thieves in
the New York area. Although he could not be certain,

MM 722-C stated his opinion that JOSEPH MEROLA could

very possibly have been "the man behind the robbery of the
owners of Hofbrau Haus".

On April 3, 1961, MM 722-C advised that he had
just learned that during the past two or three weeks,
MEROLA reportedly sold to the two men working for hia,
known to MM 722-C only as PAT and MIKE, a 1959 Chris
Craft speed boat, about 20 feet long, for which MEROLA had
Previously told MM 722-C he had paid $6,300.00.

Informant did not learn the name or any identification
number for this boat, and stated that due to circimstances
at the time, he had been unable to make any further
inquiry along this line.

In preparation for interview of MEROLA concerning
this theft, SA H. WAYNE SWINNEY telephonically contacted
MM 722-C on the night of April 3, 1961, for any additional
information. Informant advised SA SWINNEY that he was
reluctant to make the following a matter of record, as he
felt certain only he (MM 722-C) knew this information.

He continued that he had learned from MEL ADLER, a mutual
acquaintance of MM 722-C and JOSEPH MEROLA, that MEROLA
had come into possession of some expensive jewelry
immediately following the robbery of the owners of the
Hofbrau Haus Restaurant. Informant advised ADLER told
him MEROLA had sold two pieces of this jewelry locally

in order to obtain $5,000.00 to give to his "two boys”
for them to use in getting out of town until things
“cooled down". MM 722-C advised both he and ADLER
surmised that was part of the Hofbrau Haus jewelry, but
could not be certain. Informant continued, cautioning
that this information should be treated most confidential,
that in conversation with CHARLES DELMONICO, son of ve

MM 644-C is presently incarcerated at Raiford
State Prison, Raiford, Florida, and is not available for
interview. Prior to his being incarcerated, MM 644-c
mentioned that EDWARD PURDY had discussed with the
informant the fact that the owners of the Hofbrau Haus
would be a good "score",

Miami sources who have in the past been aware of
PURDY's preseiice in the area, were contacted and none
have known PURDY to be in this vicinity during the month
of March, 1961.

On the afternoon of March 21, 1961, MM 722-c
telephonically contacted SA H. WAYKE SWINNEY from Jackson-
ville, Florida, advising he had just read a newspaper
account of the robbery of the owners of the Hofbrau Haus
Restaurant, Hallandale. Informant volunteered his opinion
this score might well have been pulled by JOSEPH MEROLA
of Miami Beach, inasmuch as MM 722-C in the past had
heard MEROLA comment concerning the expensive jewelry in
Possession of these victims. Informant advised the
conversation referred to had taken Place several years ago
and MM 722-C had heard MEROLA had been attending the horse
races at Gulfstream Park (located near the Hofbrau Haus
Restaurant), and might have stopped into the Hofbrau
Haus Restaurant, all of which possibly reminded MEROLA
of this score. .

. Informant further advised he had learned in the
Past that EDWARD PURDY, formerly of Miami but for the
past year or longer has lived in Chicago, had also been
interested in this score aid MM 722-C had heard PURDY
discuss same several years ago.

MM 722-C stated that jewelry owned by these
victims was beautiful and expensive jewelry; that he
himself had observed this jewelry several times, and that
most all the jewel thieves known to MM 722-C knew of the
jewelry in victim's possession.

New York City, making reference to information. furnished |

who asked MM 722-C if he would be interested in handling
a jewelry theft or "heist" in New York, involving an
elderly woman. MM 722-C reported he told this
acquaintance that because of other personal business in
which MM 722-C was engaged at that time, he declined to
handle the score for this acquaintance, but indicated

was in need of immediate cash; that the acquaintance had
been trying to get in touch with JOSEPH MEROLA's two boys,
names stated only as PAT and MIKE, but these two
individuals had been busy working for MEROLA and the

scores, had confidence in their ability to pull scores,
and that the two individuals had been busy handling jobs
for MEROLA,
