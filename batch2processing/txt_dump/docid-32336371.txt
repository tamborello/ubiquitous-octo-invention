their money. PARVIN desires to purchase source's
property as a device to obtain a kickback of one million
dollars under the table in order to make this money
available to the unknown Italians. Source agreed |

to sell his land for four million dollars and go ahead
with their proposal to attempt to compromise PARVIN,
KORSHAK and SILBERT.in this matter. SILBERT said

the price was too high but invited source to travel
with he and KORSHAK to Las Vegas on 9/20/66 to further
discuss the deal. Source stated that the Italians!
names were never mentioned but speculated they would
probably include JERRY CATENA of New Jersey because

he was previously assocated with prior owners of the
Fremont Hotel,

to Las Vegas on 9/20/66 with KORSHAK and SILBERT and
they stayed at the Riviera Hotel. Source again. presented

. Source said there has never been any doubt
in his mind that the Desert Inn, the Stardust, and the

time. There may be others also guilty but these are
the ones source has reason to believe are: guilty. -

in aman known as the spotter, who is the same man that
TEITELBAUM uses in Miami Beach, who drilled peep holes , :
in the ceiling and was able to signal with a transmitter .
to FRIEDMAN so that he would know what cards to play. :
FRIEDMAN used AL MATHES as a partner playing against KARL ; ‘
and BRISKIN. Source was told this by MATHES who was
not in on the deal but found out about it later. After
Several months play, KARL and BRISKIN reportedly lost
several thousand dollars and never knew they had been ; 3

 

cheated.

being used. in Las Vegas and said possibly the only.
honest casino in his opinion was the Golden Nugget, where

possibly the Sahara and then maybe the Tropicana.
