Sidiary Company of New York (Hertz Reservation Office, 660

Accordingly, Messrs. Hertz AG. of Zurich kept this
particular car ready (registration number, LU 29044). On

the Grand Hotel Dolder, Zurich, and was then delivered to
ALEX, who signed contract Nr. 06476 (as per enclosed photo-
copy Nr. 2) by paying the necessary deposit of US $100. 7

The car in question was returned to Hertz AG. in
Naples (Italy) on January 8, 1963, where ALEX paid the
