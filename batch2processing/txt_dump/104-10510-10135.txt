Counselor tsterton{ ony

: Previous to. his ocning here, counselor talked to the Counoll for the
+ Blind -ad;th

a nothing we could do for him and actually it: waa
‘ogulations to accept him since the medical roport

 
  

contrary to

“ {ndtoatod that'he ws industrially blinds Tho Council for tho Blind .

Af ho could. speak Fnglish they would attenpt to work with
Gourse, with his glaucoma, it would be difficult for hia

At the ond of “the interview, fontod t bodause oe his
general debilitated : ‘etndition, he did not actually wish to get into any
training program or adtuslly get into any work. situation aa hovhed just
about onvugh etrengh to ait up. Cf aourso, glavccaa is pretty generally
@onaidered to be progressive in nature and everything convernod and

n ntfoned above leaves thio counselor with the inpression that this
individual will be a Mabllity on sone one for the root of hin life and

1s not exployable.

Thoroforos of course, he is not boing accopted into thie rehabilitation
program, It would be this counsélor's reconmondation that if it sere
possible, that ho be drecred from the. Ci pregran and put on the Cuban”
Fofugoe programe Thia reocemendation is in view of the fnot that this
will be a long indefinite welfare case and it de likely that the Cuban
Refugee genorol program sill be going on long after the CEO is closed
an! vory Tikely, even shen the Cubsn Refugee program 1s closed, they
would continue on the State “elfaro. Cf course, I am in no position to

know whother thid is legally possible.
