1. In discussing the paragraph 3 requirement in
reference A for name of the Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of
the 6 Research Section in 1960-62 with one of the former
Deputy Branch Chiefs of SR-6, we were made aware of the fact
that SR-6 had a Section called the Research Section which
later was called the Operational Support Section. We had been
under the impression that the HSCA was interested in the
identities of the Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of SR- 6, which was
provided under reference CC. -

2. As nearly as we can determine at this time, the

Research Section of SR-6 ‘had no Chief:or Deputy’ in~1960..

Mr. Rudolph Balaban was made Section Chief from September
1961-62. Mr. Balaban resigned in 1970 and we have no
address. He had been assigned to the Section from August
1960 to April 1964.

3. One of the ranking officers in the Section and an
Acting Chief was Mr. Donald E. Poole, retired, c/o Marvin
Hayes, 3006 Scotty Drive, Jacksonville, Florida 32216,
