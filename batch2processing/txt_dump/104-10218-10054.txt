3. Ricardo *MIRANDA Aldana (201-787306), Guatemalan

Communist who received guerrilla training in Cuba February -
October 1962, MIRANDA has said that he was in contact with
Subject when he was in Mexico in January ~ February 1962 on

his way to Cuba. MIRANDA also said that he had met Subject
before whe> Subject was witht Auastes MIKCYAN ia Cuba (in
February 1960), MIRANDA has said that Subject has been a

close friend of Guatemalan Communist leader Bernardo LEMUS
Mendoza (P-5025, 201-091575) since 1953 (when Subject first
came to Mexico). (Source: captured documents), On 7 December
1966 a "friend from Guatemala" called Subject's office, saying
that he already knew Subject but that Subject did not know

that he was in Mexico and that he did not want to go to Subject's
office or use the telephone, He was told to call back the next
day. The next day "MIRANDA" (probably Ricardo MIRANDA Aldana)
called Subject's office, and Subject asked him to come to his
houge {fans as office) the following day at 1000 hours. (Source:
LIFEAT).

4. Liliam JIMENEZ Consuegra de LEIVA (P-5169, 201-228386),
Salvadoran Communist employed at the Imprenta Madero to proof-
read the Soviet Information Bulletin and paid by the Soviet
Press Office. She {6 married to Raul LEIVA Munoz, a Guatemalan
Communist writer, Liliam has been occasionally reported asking
for an appointment with Subject in order to discuss unspecified
matters, For example, on 22 September 1967 she said she had
an urgent matter to discuss with Subject, and Subject agreed
to see her at her house at 0900 hours on Honday, 25 September

5. Ldose Maria‘ ALVAREZ Posada (P-4415) is a Spanish Con-
munist employed by the Soviet Press Office as an editor for

' their Bulletin. He seems to be very active among Spanish

Communists in Mexico and also frequently sets up meetings be-
tween Subject and Juan REJANO Porras (P-1027, 201-109935).

The latter is one of the leaders of the Spanish Communist

Party in Mexico but also has close ties to other Communist
groups, particularly the Cubans and Czechs as well as the
Mexicans, and on at least one occasion he was seen going to

the Cuban Embassy with one of the leaders of the Guatemalan
Communist Party in Nexico. REJANO is in almost daily contact
with ALVAREZ Posada, often says that he needs to.see Subject,
urgently, has several times asked about scholarships to the
USSR for unidentified persons, On 21 July 1967 it was reported
that Subject had given ALVAREZ Posada a letter that was to be
returned to REJANO, but often Subject arranges to see REJANO
personally at the latter's house. (Source: LIFEAT).

     

6. In view of ALVAREZ Posada's apparent acting as a cute
out for Subject, as described above, the following item may
also be connected with Subject. On 29 June 1967 "Max" told
ALVAREZ Posada that there was a letter "there" from Guatemala
that had been there since 22 June but "Max" had not been able
to reach ALVAREZ Posada before. ALVAREZ Posada said he would
-be home after 1600 hours (so that "Max" could bring him the
letter). (Source: LIFEAT). Although it is pure guesswork,
the Station suggests that "Max" might be Maximiliano *SALAZAR
Garcia (201-183293), a Guatemalan Communist living in Mexico. -
SALAZAR has been very quiet recently, but on 14 July 1965 he
was reported in contact with Carlos ILLESCAS Aguirre (cf. below)
about finding housing and a job for an unidentified boy, and
it is entirely possible that he continues to. be active behind
the scenes in Guatemalan exile affairs. —

2, Lorenzo CARDENAS. Barajas = 5 . n April-May 1962

a Guatemalan Communist source was dealing with CARDENAS in
procuring arias for Guatemala, and CARDENAS told the source that
he had a great friend in the Soviet Embassy who was aware o-
-CARDENAS' arms procurement activities (Source: LINLUCK). On

19 April 1963 Subject was observed holding a‘ half-hour meeting
in a restaurant under obviously clandestine circiimstances with
CARDENAS (Source: LIEMBRACE). On 31 May 1963 the Station placed
an article in a Mexico City newspaper stating that Subject was
working with CARDENAS on smuggling arms to Central American
countries. On 21 February 1967 Subject's car was seen passing
slowly by CARDENAS, who was standing on a street corner with

a friend; Subject's wife was driving the car (Source: LIEMBRACE).
On 30 March 1967 Subject, with his wife as passenger, drove
twice within a few minutes past CARDENAS, who was sitting at an
outdoor cafe with two friends (Source: LIEMBRACE).

7. Since June 1965 until as recently as March 1967
Subject has been reported receiving telephone calls from a
"Carlos" with a non-Mexican accent. Normally Subject and
"Carlos" simply agree to meet, without naming the place,

Twice “Senor Jacobo" has been mentioned in an unclear context
during their conversations. (Source: LIFEAT), Although "Carlos"
. a8 a name is not much of a lead, the Station suggests that he
il might be identical with Carlos.ILLESCAS Aguirre (Hernandez)
(P-1901, 201~764855), Guatemalan Communist living in Mexico.
f\iasteas ILLESCAS has been very quiet since 1964, when the

 

Mexican authorities clamped down on him, he is known to have
been used by the Soviets in the past and probably still works
with them, In 1953, when ILLESCAS was still working at the
Guatemalan Embassy in Mexico, he reportedly was very active
as a courier for the Soviets (Source: LINLUCK). In 1959

 

: ys ILLESCAS was reported in contact with Nikolay Vasilyevich

AKSENOV (201-106469) ,\suspect KGB officer who was then
Assistant Soviet Cultural Attache,>a job later taken over by
Subject (Source: LIFEAT). In 1931-62 ILLESCAS was reported
to be still in contact with the Soviets in regard to guerrilla
plans for Guatemala (Source: LINLUCK). On 23 August 1967 it
was reported that ILLESCAS passed 22,000 Mexican pesos to one
of the Guatemalan Communist leaders in Mexico, This money was
described as a monthly subsidy from either the Cubans or the
Soviets intended to help the Guatemalan Communists in jail in

. Mexico. (Source: LIREBEL-2). The above references to "Senor
Jacobo" might possibly have meant Jacobo ARBENZ Guzman, former
president of Guatemala; unfortunately the tapes of the conver-
sations have been erased and the exact context in which this
name was mentioned can no longer be reconstructed.

a 8. Hava (Eva) (P-11484), wife of Guatemalan Communist
_Sergic de la PENA, was reported to have met Subject in May 1965,
On 29 May 1965 Subject invited Hava to dinner, apparently at the
suggestion of Enrique SENO Calev, Mexican Communist leader.

Subject told Hava that he was interested in her contacts with

other embassies and particularly asked her to put him in touch
with Americans, Hava was subsequently reported having Subject
and his wife to dinner on several occasions. (Source: LIFEAT).
(It seems obvious that Subject was fishing for leads through :
Hava; however, Hava's Guatemalan contacts may well have been of
no interest to Synjoct.) -

9. Victor RICO Galan (P-7354, 201-336474), Spanish~born
Mexican Communist journalist ,<agent of Cuban government known
to have been sent by the Cubans to talk to Guatemalan guer-

 

 

was in frequent contact with Subject in 1965-66, They usually
simply arranged to see each other to discuss undisclosed
matters, and Subject apparently called RICO from a pay phone
rather than from his office. (Source: LIFEAT) (Subject has
apparently provided RICO with propaganda for news articles,

but they appear to have had other common interests as well, one
of which could well have been RICO's guerrilla activities.)
