the Russian Government, Army, and people. Duririg this period, Subject has
stated that he was certain that Russia would dominate the peace conferences
which would result from this war, and has stated that the mistakes of the last
peace conference would not be repéated, inasmuch as Russia has the position of
guardian of the people of the world, and would not. permit them to be "duped"!

' again. He stated that this would be possible because of the great numbers of

people who are now organized in the labor movement. Subject continued in this
vien, stating that he did not believe that Russia would act to institute Com
munism immediately after the war, but. stated rather that Ruesia would permit

the democracies to be re-built before. it actively engaged in agitation for
"progress." Attention is invited to the Subject's choice of the word "progress."

. On the same date, Subject expressed happiness at WENDELL
WILKI£'S acceptance of the appeal before the United States Supreme Court of
WILLIAM SCHNEIDERMAN, Conmunist presently found guilty of criminal syndicalism
by the State Courts of California, He stated that he believed this was signifi- .
cant, inasmuch as WILKI# represents "Wall Street,” and the moneyed interests,
and that he believed he would ultimately accept Communism. He stated further
that WENDELL WILKI£ in his recent trip to Hollywood had appeared before a group
of motion picture and other Hollywood executives and made an "off the record"
speech. Subject stated that while he had not attended this luncheon, hé had been
told that in his speech, WILKIE stated that the reason why the people of Russia
were fighting so valiently was because they had formerly lived under a Government
which had not given them the fruits of their labors and had set up one which did.
He stated also that WILKIE had said that they were fighting strongly and bravely
to protect this country, Subject then went on to say that WILKI# had stated that
the days of big profits and the economic system which we Imow were over, and that
what Russia was doing was one of the future problems with which the businessmen
of America would have to deal. On this same date, reporting agent while speaking
to temporary Confidential National Defense Informant Number 3, who was present at
the speech, which Subject referred to, asked him whether or not WILKIE had made
any of the foregoing statements, and the Informant advised that he had not.

- Throughout the period of instant report, Subject has been
presenting the typical Communist propaganda to reporting agent, and on December
4, 1941; presented Agent with a gift in the form of a novel by EDWARD BELLAMY,
entitled, "LOOKING BACKWARD." On the flyleaf of this book, Subject made an —
appropriate and sentimental inscription, and signed it, under the name of December
4, 1941. It is noted that this book contains an introduction by thé late HEYWOOD
BROUN, in which he states, "BELLAMY did see with cleqr vision things and factors -
such tore important than the possibility of hearing a sermon without going to church.
Much which is now established in Soviet lussia bears at. least a likeness.to the
industrial army visioned in this proplieti¢.book.s However, Communiam can scareely
claim BELLAMY as its own, for he emphasizes repeatedly the non-violent features
of the revolution which he imagined, Indeed, at one point he argues that the left-
wingers of his own day impeded change by the very. excesses of their technical
philosophy.< ; : .
