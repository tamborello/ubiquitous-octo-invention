ADMINISTRATIVE

A photograph of the subject has been forwarded to.
the Bureau.

The extensive investigative period of this report
has been noted by Dallas; however, this matter has received
continuous attention throughout this period and has been kept
current through referenced communications,

 

By letter dated 12-9-65, the Dallas Office designated
the subject as a target for development under the Top Echelon '
Criminal Informant Program and requested Bureau authority to
contact and interview the subject.

By letter dated 12-21-65, (Dailas file 137-1777)
Bureau authority was received, and by letter dated 12~20-65,
the Bureau instructed that a report be submitted in this
matter along with recommendations as to whether additional
investigation was warranted in view of the subject's desig-
nation as a top echelon criminal informant target.

A copy of this report is being designated for the.
Dallas informant file concerning the subject as it contains :
background information of the subject.

In view of the subject's designation as a target

and the lack of: any information developed to date that he is
actively engaged in any criminal activities, it is not believed
by Dallas that any further investigation in the captioned case
is warranted and therefore this matter is being placed in a
closed status by Dallas. The Bureau will be kept advised of

. all pertinent developments.in connection with the deve lopment

. of the subject as a top echelon criminal informant.
