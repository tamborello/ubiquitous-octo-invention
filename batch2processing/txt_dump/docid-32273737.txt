Due to requirements of preparing background materials as quickly

Dear Mr. Schwars:

I have your letters of July 14 aod 15 to Dr. Rhoads, who is away this
week and next, and I want to acknowkedge both of them for him.

Since the first letter arrived, Dr. Dantel J. Reed, Assistant Archivist
for Presidential Libraries, has discussed with Mr. Wilderotter the re-
quest it contained and received fron him’ instructions for the Kennedy,
Johnsen and Eisenhower libraries. Unfortunately there were sone
initial misunderstandings between your staff and. Mr. Wilderotter which
I hope have now been worked out to your satisfaction. If there is
anything further I, Dr. Rhoads, or Dr. Reed can do to assist your
investigation, please let us know.

Sincerely,

2 OT heit

Dear Dr. Rhoads:

As the Select Committee proceeds with its investigation of
paramilitary operations--in particular in Laos--it finds that it
needs to review minutes (or memoranda of conversation) from meetings

Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, as well as notes, memos, studies

of National Security Council bodies. conducted during the Eisenhower, \
>

at and other materials on this subject lodged in the Presidential

N q libraries.

Members of the Committee staff have been in touch with Dr. Reed

eV: of your staff, who indicated that NSC material should fall within

pv the "section 11" category for White House documents—-that is, docu-
ran a ments to which the Archives can grant access on its own authority.
ip Dr. Reed did indicate that you would, of course, consult with the
rae ee White House; that should be no problem given the understanding the
ate ft Committee has with the White House about access to documents neces—
ae u sary to our inquiry. . Our contact point at the White House is
Mr. James Wilderotter (4pe- 7094), who should.be able to provide the
necessary clearance. a

Members of the Committee staff have been or willbe contacting
the three libraries notifying them of our need to review these mater-
ials. We understand that an oral assurance from you that the clear-
ance has been obtained will suffice. :

At this time, we are interested in reviewing documents pertaining
to paramilitary. operations in general and to Laos in particular for
the period mid- 1950! s through the 1960's.

Members of the Committee staff who will be reviewing these docu-
ments are (with the security clearances each possesses):
