Re speech by OREN _FENTO! POTITO, St. Petersburg, Florida,
January 16, 1964, : ey

. On January 17,'1964 TP 100 PCI (RAC) furnished to SAs JAMES
P, O'NEIL and JAMES E, WALLACE . the following information:

“On the evening of January 16, 1964 a dinner sponsored by
OREN FENTON POTITO was held at Donat's "Restaurant, 6001 Haines Road,
North St. Petersburg, Florida. The dinner meeting was informal pub—
lie in nature and approximately 41 persons were in attendance.

The source has identified POTITO as a member_of_ the Natisual
States _Rights.Party, (NSRP) in the Spring of 1963 at which time’ POTI7TO
resigned while holding. the office of National Organizer. Sincé that
time POTITO has held meetings of a public nature under various titles
all of which are non-existent organizations. He is not known to have
any national affiliation at the present, time although he is in con-_.
tact with various leaders of- rightwing groups in the United States.

In the course of his speech of some 3 hours following the
dinner POTITO touched on ‘the association between. LEE HARVEY OSWALD
and RUBY. .

, By 2 \

‘POTITO identified RUBY, redl name RUBENSTEIN, as a Commun-—
ist Party Member since 1929 and. through this connection linked -him
to OSWALD. He identified OSWALD as a Communist through his association
with the Fair Play. for Cuba Committee (FPCC).

According to POTITO only two organizations knew the route
of the parade in Dallas on November 22, 1963 for any period of time
prior to the parade and thesetwo were the United States Secret Ser-
vice and the Dallas Police Department. RUBY had insinuated himself
into the Police Department-circle, obtained the route and arranged
with OSWALD to take the job at the state school building along the
routeto Carry out the assasination, —

POTITO said ‘the "Surgeon Generals report" on the assassi-
nation stated the first bullet entereu the President's throat be1ow
the adams apple clearly showing that two persons were involved with
the first shot being fired from the bridge across the park way in
front of the car. To further substantiate thie, POTITO said there
was a bullet hole in the wind shield of the President's car.
