of the San Francisco Office have advised that it is an
excellent likeness of the Subject.

light of current criteria for SI subjects and it is believed
that he continues to meet the standards and his retention
as an SI subject is recommended,

is not deemed advisable in view of his participation in
recent CP Conventions and CP-sponsored affairs, as well
as his employment on the PW newspaper,
