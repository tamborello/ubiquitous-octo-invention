Progressive Labor Group is a catchall for the Negro Nationalists

who are now leaving the CPUSA. She also stated there were
more Negro Nationalists in SNCC and CORE than in the NaacPh<(W

On April 22, 1964, informants advised that ELIZABETH
MORA had told them that FRANCISCO MORA had just made an arrange-
ment to rent an isolated hacienda near the City of Pachuca for
the use of a group of important visiting Negroes from the United
States who are expected to arrive in Mexico about the weekend of
May 8, 9, 1964. She did not further identify the visitors nor
indicate the purpose of their visit but invited the informants
to joim the group at the hacienda after the visitors arrived.
On May 12, 1964, however, the informants advised that the pro-
posed weekend in the hacienda did not materialize. ELIZABETH
MORA had dropped the question, and the informants received the
impression that either visitors did not arrive as scheduled
or, if they did, objected to the presence of two white persons
on the ranch so that the invitation was dropped although
on both April, 26 and 29, 1964, MORA had again confirmed the
invitation. HU)

 

On May 15, 1964, the informants advised that on

the previous two days ELIZABETH MORA stated that she had_
received a letter from ROBERT WILLIAMS in Cuba which she said
proposed far more violent and emphatic procedures against
white people than had previously been offered by anyone else. :
She said she was astounded that he would assume her support in '
this matter as he knows her to be a member of the Mexican : ;
Communist Party, implying that such membership would preclude
her from approving such violent means. MORA also claimed that

Negro woman, AUDREY or AUDIE MORE or_AUDREY or AUDIE MOORE |
(phonetic) in Los Angeles, who was formerly a communist, is :
now carried on the mast head of WILLIAMS! publication "The
Crusader" as an editor of some type. MORA indicated she was - ; :
disgusted with WILLIAMS. MORA read to MEX-18 portions of one ‘
of WILLIAMS' letters which stated that guns must be obtained
and aimed at white men from the windows of homes. The infor-
mant observed that this is the type of statement made nightly
by WILLIAMS on his radio broadcast, but MORA stated she does
not listen to hig programs since their radio does not receive
Cuban stations (RY) oo

MEX-18 advised ELIZABETH MORA of the statements made
regarding her by GERTRUDE SOLTKER, but MORA stated she was not
concerned over any misunderstanding of her situation at the
Czechosiovakian Embassy or with any friends she wanted to have.

To prove her point, she stated that she and FRANCISCO MORA

had been guests of the Czechoslovakians twice that week. MORA
claimed that one of those meetings was a dinner attended by the -
Czechoslovakian Ambassador; the Ghana Ambassador, with two

other Ghana Embassy officers; and two American Negroes whom

MORA claimed were important members of MALCOLM X's staff. She
claimed that during the dinner MALCOLM X and Black Nationalism

were toasted frequently and there were two toasts for China

and several for the Czechoslovakians but none for either Russia

or KHRUSHCHEV. Subsequently, that evening MORA went to the

' Ghana Embassy to act as translator for a member of the
Czechoslovakian Embassy who went there but could not under-

stand the version of English spoken by the Ghana diplomats.

The meeting at the Ghana Embassy was not attended by the

alleged representatives of MALCOIM X. Informants were unable

to ascertain the complete purpose of those meetings but MORA NS)
stated that MALCOLM X was going to tour Africa and particularly
wanted to go to Ghana. MORA advised the informants that the
meeting at the Czechoslovakian Embassy was not the meeting she
had ‘previously stated would be held with the important Negro
visitors. from the United States, but that it was part of the —
same thing. Rwy

said that she had thought of someone in SNCC but did not have

the name or address. SMALL asked if she meant she wanted to
send material to SNCC and she stated she did not, but that ;

She desired some names and addresses from SMALL for the Academy

world-wide affair and that the President of Mexico would
open 1t. MORA stated that if SMALL knew of any "progressive"
teachers, organizations, or student organizations, or promi-
nent cultural figures that he thought would be good at such a
Congress, she would like to have their names and addresses.
She claimed that she was also making up a list and that any
dist SMALL might provide could overlap but that she wanted to
have a very good list, She added that persons attending the
Congress would have to pay their own transportation but that
their hotel and all expenses would be paid for during the
duration of the Congress. MORA cited as example of persons
she had in mind were one MARGARET (LNU) who has a small museum
in New York and Chicago and works with the uthside Community
Art Center (apparently in Chicago) and, very active in the
National Negro Art Movement, and LINU ULING (Bufile 100-353404)

In May and June, 1963, the ‘source advised that,
according to MORA, the communist revolution in Mexico is no
longer a wild dream. She claimed that the PCM had concocted
a feasible plan calling for taking over in Mexico within ten
years. She claimed that the revolution would necessitate
bloodshed and that trained soldiers would be necessary. She
stated that leaders, both Mexican and foreign, had been
trained to set up small units similar to the ones operating
in Venezuela and many of their skirmishes never reached the
newspapers. She also stated that the PCM, within the previous
year, had operated a school in Mexico to train leaders for
that revolution. She stated that when. the revolution comes,
it will need outside help which has been promised from Cuba
although Cuba will not necessarily be the country of origin.
She implied that financial support would come from the
Russians or, more probably, the Chinese. The PCM will have
a support function providing assistance and an underground,
as well as food, shelter, and men when possible. She claimed
the PCM could provide cover temporarily and finally furnish
provisional local government in areas which are taken over.
It was expected that fighting men would be recruited from among
the controlled PCM farmers! organizations Ww) .

On September 17, 1963, MEX-18 advised that the subject
introduced the source to an individual, subsequently identified
as GURGUEN. MAKSAB who is now a member of the Federal

 
 
 

ittee of the PCM. MORA claimed to the subject
that MAKSABEDIAN was a member of her branch which was described
as the leadership branch of the PCM although admittedly that was
a descriptive title and not the name of the branch. MAKSABEDIAN
subsequently outlined to the informant his concept of how the PCM
could take over Mexico through exploitation of the discontented
_middie class, and when the informant discussed this matter with
MORA, MORA stated she was. aware of the plan and it was already
being implemented which was why FRANCISCO MORA wanted to-quit
the PCM since FRANCISCO MORA did not consider such a program
to be a genuine communist revolution. According to MORA, the
so-called Leadership Branch was composed of leaders in various
fields and she qualified because of her position as a .department
head at the University of Mexico San Carlos Campus and*her ;
husband was in the Branch "on a pass", indicating that it was fy{w)
