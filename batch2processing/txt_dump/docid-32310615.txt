RAMIREZ now expects that he will be called to Havana to
. explain about his resignation and hopes that he will, as
SECRET he will now, be able to say that he will continue working
> but must have sufficient money on which to live. He
stated that he estimated that he would need about. $400.
and that if the question comes up in any disucssion, that
is _the figure that he will name. He said that, ad Jest ;

   

in ‘the Cuban State ‘Department and-was - the person. who” —

_ obtained RAMIREZ’ job for him, FERNANDEZ has charge of
all the consulates in the world and serves as an inspector.
RAMIREZ feels that FERNANDEZ will take his part in any
trouble which may atise.

: RAMIREZ stated that LEON received a reprimand —
from RAUL ROA, Cuban head of the State Department because
recently LEON has refused to validate the certificate which

_ those Cuban pensioners living in the United States have
signed in order to receive their pensions. One of these -
which he tefused to sign was tl of a Mrs, ALEMAN, the — be
mother of JOSE ALEMAN, JOSE was the former owner of Els
the Tradewinds Motel on Mi: ‘Beach and at one time head Zz, we
ef the Cuban Revolutionary Organization, "Cuba Rebelde," _
and a pro-revelutionary figure, Also, the ALEMAN family
had control of Aero Postal Airlines and were prominent
figures. When the signing of her paper was refused, she
went to Cuba and made a complaint and it resulted in a
cablegram asking LEON what was the matter with him for
refusing to sign. This caused more trouble in the consulate.
