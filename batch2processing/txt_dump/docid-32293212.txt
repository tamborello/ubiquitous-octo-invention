11. Possibilities of obtaining desired information by other means

” (Explain in detail):
Attempts to develop-information concerning MARCELLO's
activities and existence of La Cosa Nostra through inter-
views with hoodlum subordinates of MARCELLO have to date
been unsuccessful. While we have a number of potential’:
Top Echelon Criminal Informants under development, none
have identified existence of La Cosa Nostra and CARLOS
MARCELLO's leadership of this organization.

12... Risks of detection involved:
As noted above, the Town House management has furnished
to this office for our exclusive use table lamps which ’
are the same as those used in all rooms and suites in
the Town House Motel. It is anticipated that Mutt
Microphones will be installed in these lamps by the
Laboratory for use on this misur. If the installation
of these microphones, in the lamps in not feasible, it
is anticipated that this misur will be effected by use
of two Wasp Plugs. It is felt that the risks of detection
are negligible using this type of equipment.

 

13. Probable length of technical surveillance:

90 days. However, misur will last only one to two days
at intervals of once every four to six weeks. ;

14, Request made for technical surveillance by any outside agency
(name specific official, title and agency):
None
