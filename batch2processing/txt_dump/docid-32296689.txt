MM T-1 is MM 1337-8.

For the information of the Bureau, in order to
protect MM 1337-S, prior to interviewing RODRIGUEZ, Special 7 |
Agents WILLIS E, WALTON and GEORGE E, DAVIS, JR. interviewed :
ANDRES NAZARIO SARGEN, head of Alpha 66, and JUAN JOSE PERUYERO, ;
head of Brigade 2506, and notified them that they were being :
served with a warning that the U.S. Government would vigorously
investigate and prosecute any violations of Federal law
occasioned by Cuban exiles in opposition to the hijacking agreement
between the United States and Cuba. Both of these individuals
were requested to pass the word along to other Cuban exile
organizations and individuals. This was done in order to protect
MM 1337-S by giving RODRIGUEZ the impression that his interview
by FBI Agents was the result of a general program.

Also, as an additional means of causing RODRIGUEZ to .
cancel out his plans against SUCHLICKI, MM 1337-S was instructed
to notify RODRIGUEZ that he had researched SUCHLICKI by making Ht
inquiry of some of his contacts at the University of Miami and | :
had determined it would be a grave mistake for RODRIGUEZ to i
attack SUCHLICKI in any way since SUCHLICKI is an ardent anti-~ i
Communist and anti-CASTRO. |
