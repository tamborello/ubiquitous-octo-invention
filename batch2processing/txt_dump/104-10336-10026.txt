SUBJECT:

1.(AIUO) Six volumes of the Oswaid files were released to HRG/CSI for review and
eventual release to the AARB. Volume V, the missing volume was never found and the conclusion
was that it either never existed and there was a numbering error or that the material from that
volume was incorporated into the other volumes.

2. (AIUO) If we send copies of the files on Nagell, Novel and Ruby to J. Barry Harrelson,
Barry's office will be responsible for determining what may be released to the AARB, and as
appropriate referring third party documents to the originating agency. He will coordinate with us
prior to releasing the files to the AARB.

3. (U) We are waiting for C/OPS concurrence prior to reproducing the files.

MEMORANDUM FOR: (Semet"A-ECRTand | ;

FROM: J. Barry Harrelson
Senior Reviewer

SUBJECT: Requested “Mission Statement” re
HRP/ARRB

1. This is in response to your request asking that HRP
provide you with a “mission statement” concerning HRP and
its relationship to the Assassination Records Review Board.
It flows from the fact that the ARRB staff has declared the
OPS files of Nagell, Novel and Ruby to “assassination
records” and our subsequent request that the files or copies
thereof be forwarded to HRP. Also, certain portions of the
files of Walter Sheridan and Harold Weisberg have or will be
declared assassination records.

2. The Historical Review Project (formerly the
Historical Review Group, CSI, DCI) has among its several
projects the responsibility to deal with the presidentially
appointed Assassination Records Review Board and its legal
mandate to find and transfer to the National Archives all
U.S. Government records relating to the Assassination of
President Kennedy. The authority of the ARRB is fairly
broad and includes: the authority to designate
files/documents “assassination records,” to determine if a
particular record or certain information within it must be
released to the Archives or postponed until 2007, and, the
power to issue subpoenas in the pursuit of its assigned
activities.

3. In the instant case, the Board staff has designated
the Nagell, Novel and Ruby security files assassination
records. Copies of them must now be processed by HRP
according to its current guidelines for release/protection
of information and the files released to the Archives. With
respect to the files on Sheridan and Weisberg, further
review by the Board is necessary to designate which, if any,
portions of them are assassination records.

4. I hope that the above fulfills your requirement in
this matter and I look forward to receipt of the files.

Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board's requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to

several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of -..- <1 -- - an

requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be ~
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April-1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

'As identified more fully below, the issues are: CLA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03 a
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.
