INTERNAL SECURITY « Cy

Rerep Special Agent John L. Fagan dated 1/3/64
at New York.

It is noted that the FD-305 submitted with rerep
indicates the report is being classified “Confidential”
but that certain information furnished by UF 1491<3%
should be classified “Secret,” Since the report contains
information attributed to WF 1491-8* under the symbol T-6,
the report should have been classified "Secret" rather than
"Confidential" as all reports on Security Index subjects
are disseminated to the Department of Justice. Wi ale

tion

Additionally, on page 5 of rerep, the
received from T-6 is set forth. It is believed that this
information requires additional clarification, if available.
The source of the contributions received by Forer should be
set forth if known since it 4s ambiguous as to whether this
money represents “contributions” actually money
received in payment of legal toes. (ys

Abt recently received nationwide publicity when
Lee Harvey Oswald publicly stated following his arrest that
he wanted Abt as his attorney. . The report makes no mention
of this fact, and it is believed it should ‘be set forth in
the report. — ve

Dissenination of the report is being held in

abeyance and it is desired you make appropriate changes
and submit same to the Bureau
