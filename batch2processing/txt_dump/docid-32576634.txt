LUIGI MORICI, the boss in Baltimore
JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI ;
FRANK MALVASO__ .
CHARLIE BARBERA
MARIO.ANELLO —
FRANK CORBI
‘JIMMY CARONA, @lso known as Jimmy Russo
a : a oo Ay .
Informant stated he recalled that his father had
told him that PATSY CORBI, brother of FRANK CORBI, had
been a member ofthe Mafia in West Virginia. Informant
.sbelieved that FRANK CORBI is a member of La Cosa Nostra
because of. his close association with LUIGI MORICI. He.
also felt that FRANK CORBI would have to be a member since
he heard that he was shaking down his nephew, EDDIE CORBI,

the bondsman on Baltimore Street.

.. Informant..stated that JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI had been
active in the numbers rackets’ in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
prior to°20 years ago, but had been run out of Pittsburgh
by other racketeers. GIGLIOTTI had been friendly with the
VOLPE brothers in Pittsburgh,.who were murdered about that
time. GIGLIOTTI had been tried for a killing in the Pittsburgh
area, but not.convicted and informant believed he is considered
a "gun" for La Cosa Nostra. Informant commented that it
is.a mark of: dishonor for an Italian to have his face cut
and that he believed GIGLIOTTI had also taken part in this
type of criminal activity. He said that he had no proof
or even anyyarticular incident in mind, but he suspected
that GIGLIOTTI may have made trips out of Baltimore for
the purpese of carrying out some’ sentence of La Cosa Nostra.

On October 21, 1965, Confidential Informant BA T-1
advised that GIACOMO ROMANO, also known as Jimmie’ Romano,
1 Riverside Drive, Essex, Maryland, had referred to the
age and illness of LUIGI MORICI and stated that "we are a
family without a father." He had said that his leaders were
then JIMMY RUSSO, also known as Jimmy Carona, and one of
the CORBI brothers who operate on "The Block", Baltimore
night.club district. Informant therefore assumed that these
persons were members of a local Italian syndicate.
