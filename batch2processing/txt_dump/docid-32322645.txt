The originals removed from these files and replaced with
duplicate copies of the original were accessioned to the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) pursuant to the JFK
Records Collection Act of 1992. Provision of the JFK Act allowed for
certain information to be postponed from public release until the
year 2017; therefore, the pages have NOT necessarily been released

-for public review in their entirety.

Under the JFK Act, originals to all material deemed
assassination records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of
whether the material is open in full or released with information
postponed. Therefore, any documents or pages from FBI files
accessioned to NARA pursuant to the JFK Act are no longer considered
the possession of the FBI. The duplicate pages have been inserted
strictly for research purposes.

: The copies contained within the previously mentioned
file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date classification.
