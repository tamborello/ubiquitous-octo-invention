: . and when the strike is settled, they sign a contract

mo, that has tutilit y:", The five barns that sign the first . . r
contract should get a chance to change their contract to

put in 'utility.? ." -

The disucssion continued, and was generally inaudible
because of the three individuals talking at once, but uv
'. JULIUS was heard to’ remark, "560 drivers - TONY PRO" and :

v : JULIUS apparently is referring to the fact that some of
the barns or companies have employees who are members of
“Local 560 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
It is noted-that TONY PRO, true name TONY PROVENZANO, is
an official in Local 560, IBT.

JULIUS stated, "RED MIKE gave you Local 641 men." and _.
CONNIE agreed, making an inaudible remark, and then stated,
"JIMMY wants (inaudible) ."

An unknown number of individuals joined the conversa-
tion, ahd all went into the outer. office. NOONAN and FUREY
returned to NOONAN's office, and spoke in low tones, NOONAN >
remarked, "I'm in trouble now. Bad trouble (inaudible).
Yeah, but he's different." The remainder of the. conversa~
tion is inaudible; however, mention is made of two shop :

‘ stewards, and, later on in the conversation, NOONAN quoted

: an unknown individual, "I can't afford a strike, I'll sign
anything." The informant was of the opinion that this
conversation was a continuation of the previous. conversation
concerning the present negotiations. | . ‘

 

With respect to the question of "utility", it is noted

' that this question has been a major point with Local 1730 of
the ILA. NY 1716-c has previously explained that the members
of Local 1730 generally work under the so-called checker
system, where certain individuals are authorized to work the
Hi-Lo Machines, and other individuals are authorized to work
as checkers. ‘Under the "utility" system, all individuals
could be utilized as the situation warranted, either as
Hi-Izo operators, or as checkers.

_ On 1/25/63, NY 1716-c advised that a meeting was
held on -1/23/63, at Local 1730, ILA, Union Hall, and this
was a meeting of the wage-scale committee, The informant
advised only two. shop stewards at the meeting were holding
out against "utility". THOMAS-W, "TEDDY" GLEASON, Treasurer
of Local 1730, talked to these two shop stewards, and
told them they could not stop the wheels of progress,
| and that if these two shop stewards continue to block
; "utility", he, GLEASON, would send them pack to JIMMY,
Informant advised GLEASON apparently was referring to
the fact that JIMMY "BLUE EYES" (VINCENT ALO) had been :
helpful in placing both of these shop stewards in their ao ff
union positions. °

x

Informant also stated that CONNIE NOONAN told |
one of the shop stewards that he was getting out of line, | ,
and that even though he, NOONAN, was a "general" in the :
organization, he had to take orders too, and that the .
_ orders were "to get utility”. '

- The informant pointed out that this is the first
time GLEASON had committed himself for "utility", and |
informant believes that outside pressure is being put on
GLEASON, aS GLEASON is the real head.of Local 1730.

THE ABOVE INFORMATION FURNISHED BY NY 1716-C IS:

AND A FOURTH PARTY, ‘THEREFORE, EXTREME CARE SHOULD BE
