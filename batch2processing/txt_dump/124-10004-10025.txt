who acquired this intelligence information, I feel a so
responsibility for seeing it through (to its final evaluation."
It appears, therefore, that Mr. THOMAS has now decided that he

and not the FBI or the Department of Justic¢e is the one to

decide how the story given’ by Miss GARRO is to be evaluated.

The concept that every person who passes on to another govern-
ment agency information relating to matters within the jurisdiction
of that agency has the responsibility and authority to review

and expla Cd action taken by that agency is, of course,
untenable. ON

Further question concerning Mr. THOMAS’ judgment is
raised@xby item 3 of paragraph 10 of his memorand furn
the Secretary of State. Any reference to the
relationship between the head of CIA Mexico and top Mexican
officiais,if true, is a very highly classified matter and any
"leak" or revelation to unauthorized individuais concerning such
an arrangement would, in view of the delicate Mexican political
situation, be disastrous to the Mexican Government as well as
to Mexican-American relations. The delicacy of the situation
has recently been greatly augmented by the published Cuban
allegation that one of the officers of the Mexican Embassy in
Havana ent (urs as a CIA spy with the knowledge of the Mexican

 

 

Government.| Mr. THOMAS, however, included such a highly
classifie eference in a memorandum which he classified dnly
as "confidential", contrary to regulations relative to classification
of documents. While this reference relates to the activities and
operations of another Government agency and therefore is not of
primary concern te the Bureau, it is nevertheless called to the
Bureau's attention fo; onsideration in evaluating Mr. THOMAS'
current allegations. cal : :

An additional copy of this letter is being forwarded
for use in the event the Bureau desires to forward a copy to

Dallas which received a copy of referenced totter. C2)
