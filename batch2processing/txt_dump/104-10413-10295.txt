III, Planning for the Future

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes
to remain uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditures of |
a-great portion of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one
target...such as Soviet Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically,
however, that should the need arise for LIFEAT to again assume such
responsibilities, it is fully able to do so, Until such time LIFEAT
will continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employment of its

assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish
to reveal

Expenditures

Approval for. renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 August 1962 for
FY 1963 in the amount’ of $99,000.00. The proposed budget for FY 1964
is broken down in the attached Field Project Outline Renewal Request,
Part II,, and totals$83, 808.

 

. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those noted in the project outline
‘ submitted herewith and in the individual contracts and oral agreements

(memoranda of oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the
various LIFEAT personnel.

of the ACGM including their travel plans to Mexico and in some cases
Cuba, As noted in paragraph I. E. above, the local office of ODENVY
considers this coverage "quite valuable". As also noted in previous
renewals, LIFEAT ability to give the interested case officers a check
on active and former agents increases the security of present opera-
tions and provides greater security for long term assets who may have
“been in contact with now terminated agents,

H, ‘Conelusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided
other Station operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the i
ability of the unilateral LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets
‘without revealing Station interest to the liaison forces, well justify
the expenditure of funds, time, personnel and security risk, As it has
_ been noted in the past, that even.:with the Station's envolvement in the
parallel, but liaison-type LIENVOY operation, a change in e
ra change i
could end KUBARK participation in tha *
LIFEAT, in addition to maintaining i heavy
| coverage, must be available to once again undertake coverage of the
official Soviet and Czech official targets in Mexico City, Therefore,
-LIFEAT! s present orientation, though toward supporting Station operations
“and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positive
J:intelligence, leaves it readily available for recall into the Soviet-
.€zech coverage, It is the Station's firm opinion that the LIFEAT

‘operations.

Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and
are therefore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of
- time, For this reason percentage fipures as to completion of project
objectives cannot be drawn, However, an indication of the coverage
provided in working toward fulfillment of the objectives can be noted
in that approximately 12,500 pages of raw text were produced in the
period July. 1961 through April 1963, LIFEAT has been in daily opera-
tion during the review period with the average number of lines covered
“ per month being 18, and a high in October 1962 of 25 lines covered,

LIFEAT/Soviet: The valuable assistance which LIFEAT rendered Station
efforts in this area was amply displayed in its support of Station
assets mounting a technical surveillance operation targeted against
the home of a known Soviet intelligence officer stationed in Mexico.

«City under official cover, LIFEAT information provided vital infor-
mation which enabled the Station to establish a pattern of action

.. of both the family of the Soviet officer and. his maid. This infor-

. mation made possible the setting of a time for the actual entry into
the target, and continuing coverage (including live monitoring of the
target line immediately preceeding the operation) by LIFEAT made

“possible a degree of security for this operation which would not have
been possible without the support of a unilateral tap operation,
Further LIFEAT coverage has, in addition to giving information on

“the daily activities and contacts of Soviet officials, provided an ex-
cellent check on the contacts of three KUBARK: controlled double agents

‘with their Soviet Case Officers, This coverage has enabled the respon-

.uSible Case Officer to guide his operations with increased assurance

'. that his agents continue to be fully cooperative and under his control,

LIFEAT/Cuban: LIFEAT activities in this area were concerned primarily
with support to the AMSTRUT operation. Coverage of relatives of
AMSTRUT-2 provided an excellent "window" into the operation which
enabled the responsible Case Officers to move with more certainty
‘and security in developingthis operation. The Case Officers involved —
considered the LIFEAT coverage an essential check on the activities of
. the principals in the case which was especially valuable during the
_ dmitial stages of the operation, Travel plans of AMSTRUT-2 provided
| by LIFEAT were also essential to the timing of the operation. Also
_. in the Cuban area LIFEAT coverage of G-2 agent enabled the Station
eto gain an insight into his contacts and activities. Further, recent
' Anitiation of coverage of a Cuban Commercial Official gives evidence
of producing solid information of commercial transactions and Mexican
Commercial contacts of the Cuban Government, :

 

LIFEAT/Polish: LIFEAT continued its coverage in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK

operation, (See previous project renewal for background of this case

and the LIFEAT participation in it.) Of great interest to this operation

was LIFEAT information indicating that the wife of BEKNAVE had become

aware of his interest in another woman, and later revelation of reassign-
- ment and travel plans of BEKNAVE.

- year, In particular, LIFEAT coverage of

 

 

LIFEAT/Yugoslav: In addition to the usual information concerning
the Yugoslav officials and their daily contacts and activities,
LIFEAT provided leads which could pay off in future operations.

- One example was a lead which revealed that a diplomatic courier

would. be travelling alone and taking a new travel route while
earrying an official pouch. With this early warning, the Station
was able to plan an operation to provide access to this correspon-
dence, Although Headquarters finally vetoed this particular oper-
ation, sufficient early warning was given by LIFEAT so that the
operation could have been carried out. Another example of this
type of lead was the data available from LIFEAT coverage that a
new location was being sought for the Yugoslav Embassy, and which

"specific locations were under consideration, Armed with this informa-

tion the Station has been able to make a technical casing of one of
the prospective sites and obtain information necessary for entry into
the other sites,

LIFEAT/Exile: As noted previously, LIFEAT coverage of the exile
activities was the single major effort by LIFEAT during the project

 

 

 

 

which included lengthy periods of “live-monitoring”, on occasion
ealled for coverage of five lines. Cabled summaries of LIFEAT
information were provided Headquarters and Station Guatemala, It
is. believed that the importance of this LIFEAT coverage can not be
stressed too much, LIFEAT Coverage of a Costa Rican Communist exile
resident in Mexico City has lead to a wealth of operational leads
including the discovery of this person's envolvement in a Communist
funding mechanism. Also, LIFEAT was active in covering the Spanish

“Republican exile community in Mexico City during the GPIDEAL visit

to Mexico, LIFEAT coverage in this case was considered necessary

~ to. reveal immediately any renewal of an earlier planned attempt on

the life of an ODYOKE official by one group of the Republican Exiles,
Ultimately, LIFEAT revealed the departure from Mexico of two of the
ringleaders in the plot.

on a former SMOTH agent whose past actions gav or some suspicion of
his present activities, Product from this line has revealed an effort
by a group of this individual's friends to discredit the senior ODACID
official in Mexico, Early warning by LIFEAT has made possible the
preparation of counter action (see HMMA-21364). LIFEAT has also
provided coverage of a suspected RIS support agent. This coverage
had provided the background material necessary for checking on the
activities of this suspect agent, Continuing LIFEAT reporting on the
American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM) has provided ODENVY with
great quantities of information on activities of leftist friends of

Yugoslav Coverage

LIFEAT coverage of the Yugoslav official installation in Mexico City
-has provided a wealth of information on the contacts, activities, and
travel of members of that mission. Since the Station's effort against
‘this target was greatly increased within the last year, LIFEAT infor-
mation has been used extensively to provide the basic operational and
personality data necessary for this stepped-up program, Examples of

_ LIFEAT produced positive intelligence and general operational informa-
_tion.on this target are as follows: :

Cuban Coverage

During the reporting period LIFEAT coverage of the Cuban target was
directed toward the support of KUBARK operations in this field and was,

anol.-dssimned-io-provids_nosiiive intelligence. LIFEAT covered 2 total.
of 10 lines in direct support of operations in this field, Most of

the product of this area of operation was forwarded by cable to JMWAVE
and Headquarters, Examples of pouch communications in this field are:

American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM)

_ As noted in past project reviews, most of the targets in this group
have been covered at the request of ODENVY, and the raw take has been
processed by them, During the period July 1962 through May 1963
‘approximately 390 reels of take were passed to the local ODENVY for

; their processing. On 23 August 1962 the local ODENVY advised, "This
' loffice feels the coverage mentioned is quite valuable and many useful
leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly with regard to
travel in and out of Mexico of American Communists who are in contact
with: individuals on whom coverage is maintained", Typical examples
of reporting based on LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM are:

Exile and Revolutionary Activities

During the past year this area of activity, in addition to the already

- noted Cuban coverage, accounted for the greatest percentage of the
_LIFEAT effort. Most of the information provided by LIFEAT in its

coverage of targets in this area was not available from other sources,

operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting the
operations of Mexico City Station through the production of leads and
the providing. of information on selected targets in the manner available
only through the use of a unilateral telephone tap operation. Indeed,
it is in this area, secure support tothe Station's operations, that
LIFEAT is of greatest and unique value to the Station. The following
