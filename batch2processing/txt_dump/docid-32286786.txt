extremely desirous that an up- ~to-date contact be, maintained

WILLIAMSON is in a position to furnish the most up-to-date
coverage of GIANCANA regarding GIANCANA's activities while

out of the Chicago Division. In this regard, it is felt that
in order to serve the best interests of the Bureau and to
maintain up-to-date coverage of GIANCANA, the Kansas City Officg
should endeavor to convince ROBERT MARTIN that WILLIAMSON should
be convinced of the necessity of meeting with agents in either
New York or Chicago. It should be stressed to MARTIN that
complete security would be assured WILLIAMSON in any meetings

CG 92-349

-In the event MARTIN is unable to convince WILLIAMSON
of the necessity of meeting with agents in Chicago or New
York, MARTIN should determine from WILLIAMSON the city frequented
the most by WILLIAMSON during his travels and arrangements
can be made through the division covering said city to
arrange an appropriate meeting with WILLIAMSON at such times
as WILLIAMSON visits the city in question. (L)

f

 

 

It is further pointed out that the Kansas City .
Division should stress to MARTIN the need for WILLIAMSON to
furnish information concerning GIANCANA's activities, '
immediately upon his learning of same so that proper coverage \
can be afforded these activities, The Kansas City Division
is requested to advise MARTIN that should WILLIAMSON desire

to make contact with the Chicago Division, he should attempt
to contact SA MARSHALL E. RUTLAND to whom the GIANCANA case +

 

is assigned. (Wo

Should WILLIAMSON continue to be adverse to meeting
with agents in either Chicago or New York and a third city i
be selected by WILLIAMSON, the Chicago Division suggests that \
the Bureau allow either Chicago or New York Agents to make
contact with WILLIAMSON at the designated city, the contacting
agents being determined by the proximity to either New York
or Chicago. It is felt that the most desirable situation
would be for Chicago Agents knowledgeable with GIANCANA's
activities, associates, and movements, if at all possible, :
be allowed to make these contacts: g2émwedD vv AWAGCGEROUS. |
