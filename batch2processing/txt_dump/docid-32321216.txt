If, on the other hand, the concern is about information withheld in other
assassination records, the Review Board is open to any evidence of a current national-*
security need to postpone its release. The Review Board has voted on thousands of
redactions of classified information, upholding postponements where the requirements
of the JFK Act were satisfied. The Review Board is committed to applying the JFK Act
to the merits of each proposed redaction, rather than to broad-brush categories of
assertedly sensitive information.

D. The Government of Russia Has Officially Acknowledged That, in Past
: American Embassy in Moscow.

By way of underscoring the evils that allegedly would follow upon release of
these records, the FBI states that, to its knowledge, "no other country officially
acknowledges using specific investigative techniques to target the establishments or
officials of foreign countries within their territory or elsewhere." FBI Petition, p. 11.

The State Department knows otherwise. In remarks to the National Press Club
on December 13, 1991, then-Ambassador to Russia Robert S. Strauss related in dramatic
terms how KGB Chief Vadim V. Bakatin had personally admitted to him "not only...
that his agency had bugged the new American Embassy in Moscow but also turned
over detailed plans that he said showed how it had been done,” along with a suitcase
filled with electronic equipment.® Additionally, one of the authors of this
memorandum was personally assured by an American Embassy official in Warsaw,
Poland, on Wednesday, April 17, 1996, that the Polish intelligence service had advised

 

“The FBI cites as potentially damaging disclosure of intelligence activities
directed atlallies such as France, Israel, and Venezuela\FBI Petition, p. 10). The Review Cs]
Board has voted on postponements relating to the FBI's electronic surveillance on
establishments of all three of these countries. In these records, where immediate release
in full posed a more plausible threat to foreign relations, the Review Board voted to
protect most of the information the FBI had classified. The FBI did not appeal the
additional releases.

FBI's claim for postponement.”

The FBI also asserts that the Review Board's decision in Exhibit 10 to postpone
the symbol number for this tap, while releasing the names of the conversants and other
identifying information, is inconsistent. Petition, p. 8. In this regard, the FBI fails to
mention that, in another record of an intercept from this same tap, the FBI unilaterally
released the identities of the conversants and the entire report of their conversation,
while postponing only the symbol number designating the tap.” Given this release, it
would have been inconsistent for the Review Board to have protected anything more
than the symbol number in Exhibit 10. The "inconsistency," therefore, lies with the
Bureau and not the Review Board.

The FBI further suggests regarding Exhibit 10 that the Review Board's decision
would disclose that, in 1963, the FBI was tapping a transoceanic cable for a circuit
dedicated to phone traffic between the United States and the Soviet Union. Petition,
p.9. This is not accurate. The Review Board's decision discloses only the fact of the
intercepts and does not disclose the method by which the intercepts were made. That
the intercepts were accomplished through a tap on the transoceanic cable, rather than,
for example, a tap or listening device specifically targeting a conversant, is not
revealed.”

The FBI finally argues that release of such information would "reveal the speed
with which we were able to translate and digest these conversations|,] . . . our interests,
and priorities, and what we considered important or trivial. Such information will be -
used to develop and deploy effective countermeasures." Petition, p.9. But

 

*Section 6(1)(B) of the JFK Act requires, among other things, that a postponed
source or method be "currently utilized, or reasonably expected to be utilized."

See Assassination Record Number 124-10062-10391.

comparing records and seeing that the same source in New York intercepted phone
conversations between Moscow and New York and also between Fort Worth and

was not looking at the proposed redactions, which say nothing about the circumstances,
abilities, interests, or uses of the information, whereas the information released by the
Church Committee and the Bureau itself does. If the circumstances of the Z-coverage
program are among the Bureau’s most "closely guarded secrets," one fears for those
secrets that are not so closely guarded.

D. Electronic Surveillance (Exhibits 10 - 12)

The Bureau proposes to redact information in three documents that relate to
electronic intercepts of telephone and teletype communications involving Russian,
Polish, and Cuban officials.

Exhibit Number — Text of FBI’s Proposed Redactions

Ex. 10 (10396) [Miscellaneous redactions on pages 1 and 2]
Ex. 11 (10048) ‘ "1498-8*,4 "Polish national," "Polish newspaper," [and C. $3

numerous redactions on pages 3 and 4]

Ex. 12 (10222) [according to]{'WF 1196-S* hdvised that the Cuban. $ 3
Ministry of Foreign Relations advised the Cuban
Mission to the United Nations (UN) that,” [and
additional redactions on page 2]

The Bureau offers essentially two reason to support these postponements: first,
the decisions regarding which lines to tap are secrets, and second, disclosing the
information would have the adverse foreign policy ramification of revealing the
particular targets of investigative interest. ;

; (a) The Government already has acknowledged that the FBI conducted
extensive electronic surveillance of foreign establishments during the 1960s. The
Bureau has already disclosed that, in 1963, it installed 244 national security wiretaps

also, the Review Board cannot agree to postponement of this information under the JFK
Act. .

(b) The Bureau has failed to offer any evidence showing why disclosure of
these particular intercepts would compromise the national interest. The issue,
therefore, is not whether electronic surveillance itself is a secret. Rather, the issue is
whether the disclosure of the particular intercepts at issue here would reveal a source
or method currently requiring protection. The Review Board staff repeatedly invited
the Bureau to provide evidence that:there is some particular sensitivity associated with
the specific intercepts at issue. The Review Board staff suggested, for example, that if
the same telephone or teletype lines are used today or if individuals whose
conversations were intercepted are of current operational interest, such information
would be highly relevant under the standards of the JFK Act.

The Bureau, however, was unable to provide evidence that any of the appealed
intercepts have any current operational significance. Rather than providing the specific
evidence contemplated by the JFK Act, the Bureau resorted to citing its policy against
disclosure of such information generally.” In fact, the evidence that is available
suggests that there is no current intelligence interest in the telephone and teletype
intercepts now at issue. The Bureau's Petition does not disclose that the source in
Exhibit 10 was actually discontinued in 1970” -- a fact that seriously undermines the

 

conversations and retained the tapes for several years); William C. Sullivan, The Bureau:
My Thirty Years in Hoover's FBI 178-79 (1979) (former Assistant to FBI Director describes
FBI phone taps on Soviet and Czech Embassies); Pierre Thomas & John Mintz, Petty
Officer Arrested on Spy Charges, The Washington Post, Apr. 24, 1996, at A3 (wiretaps used
on "Russian embassies and other facilities"); John Mintz, Spy Watchers Outmanned by ~
Communist Operatives, The Washington Post, Aug. 4, 1985, at Al (FBI monitored Soviet
Embassy phone conversations in 1980).

 

7For example, rather than provide the specific evidence requested, the Bureau
merely states that the "[h]ow, when, where, and under what circumstances" the Bureau
implements electronic intercepts are among its "closely guarded secrets." Petition, p. 6.

 

See Assassination Record Number 124-10067-10273. The FBI has advised the
Review Board that the source discussed in this record was(NY 1519-S*.} ()

Dear Mr. President:

We believe that when the redactions at issue are carefully analyzed, with due regard to
the information that is already a matter of public record, it will be clear that there are no
meaningful “national security” or “foreign relations” concerns that warrant suppression
of the information from the public.

Under the controlling legislation, you have the:
a

sole and nondelegable authority to require the disclosure or post-
ponement of such record[s] or information under the standards set forth
in section 6, and the President shall provide the Review Board with an
