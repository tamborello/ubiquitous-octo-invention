SD 92-184

; DALITZ and COHEN met SD 1064-C-TE and ROSELLI
i _at Hyatt House and they all then went to the Brow
Derby Restaurant nearby.

Informant advised that ROSELLI thereafter informed

DALITZ he wanted money he felt was due him. During the

discussion, ROSELLI claimed that he had a major part in

| sale of Desert Inn to HOWARD HUGHES by DALITZ and claimed

: that through his efforts DALITZ remained on, in a managerial

capacity, in the Desert Inn and Stardust Hotéls, Las Vegas,

after the sale’to HUGHES, ROSELLI claimed that during the

i presale negotiations he was presént with GEORGE GORDAN

‘ and MORRIS KLEINMAN and that he (ROSELLI) was supposed to
get $60,000 per month from the time of thé sale until €ime

: DALITZ left the hotels. He indicated that he received none

: o£ this' money. He also indicated that his $60,000 a month

f. due him was not for him alone but that he also had

ty to distribute some of it to "his people," nodding toward the

informant. ROSELLI indicated that as a result of his

i> efforts, HUGHES was able to purchase the Desert Inn and later

the Stardust and that DALITZ thereafter was in a position to la

continue skimming money. ROSELLI explained that he was now short .

of money as the result of continued legal pressure and

convictions.

 

Informant advised that DALITZ denied having any ee
knowledge or remembering any details-to7such an agreement i
with ROSELLI. DALITZ told ROSELLI that if he was trying
to shake him down he was not going to stand for it. DALITZ
claimed that he has: always been "100% straight" and at this
late date he was not going to stand for a shake down.

 

 

. DALITZ further told ROSELLI that he always
considered ROSELLI to be a millionaire and did not know
that he was in need of money at this time. He told
ROSELLI that if money meant keeping him out of jail it
was a different story and he would assist him but again
stressed the fact that he was not going to be the victim
of a shake down.

   

ROSELLI continued to claim that DALITZ and his
group owed him $60,000 a month from the time HUGHES
purchased the hotel until DALITZ's group left the
Management.

“DALITZ ended the discussion by saying that he
_ would go to Miami and discuss it with KLEINMAN, GEORGY

 

SVR Yes .
