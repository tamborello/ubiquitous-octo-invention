Re San Antonio letter to Miami, 10-19-67.

An additional copy of this letter is being submitted
to the Bureau for information of their file on "LEE HARVEY
OSWALD, IS - RUSSIA - CUBA".

For information of the Bureau and other offices,
at approximately 9:00 P.M., 10-16-67, an individual, who did
not wish to furnish his identity, telephoned the San Antonio
= FBI office. He advised that he wanted to furnish that office
some information about a Mexican citizen named ROBERTO NIETO.
The caller said that NIETO is a personal friend of FIDEL CASTRO
_ and that he has traveled_to Cuba at least three times in the
“last 18 months to see CASTRO. NIETO, according to the caller,
is presently living in, or has been living in, Miami. His
purpose there is to keep track of the Cuban refugees in
Miami. He was supposedly enrolled in one of the local

The caller advised that NIETO is a very wealthy ~
man, that he had a concession from the Mexican Government
to transport oil and butane from Mexico into the interior,

and lost his concession. The caller further stated that
NIETO is an extreme liberal. He did not know NIETO's address
in Miami and could not furnish a description of him. The
