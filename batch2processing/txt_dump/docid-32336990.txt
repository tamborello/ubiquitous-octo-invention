cause is the liberty of Cuba, their politics,
liberty and loyalty only to the people of Cuba.

on fighting. They do not make political propaganda,
and the truth is that they would exchange all the
politicians for a single + rifle with which to fight |
BATISTA. .

- pay attention, because they have a burning desire for —
liberty, for here the credo of all is Liberty or Death.

_ are fighting against oppression in a form very similar ‘4
i to that used, by the founders of our country... _
