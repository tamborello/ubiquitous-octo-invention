In order to further evaluate question of whether

. inet 6235S is telling full truth in this matter, possibility

should be considered that he was among individuals who met

resolve thig point, you should exhibit photograph of
informant to Mra. Taaffe. However, in view of Mrs. Taaffe
doubtful reliability, photograph of UM 635¢S should be
included in group of photographs of other Cuban nationals.
