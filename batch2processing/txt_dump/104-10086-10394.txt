street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

‘LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental |

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion receiyed word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was

. being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

‘ graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in-the middle of |

“the block south. It had a planted view of the front gate of the Soviet °

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The -

‘purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen,. the son of an American mother

“and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILyRIC sites three times a week. The film was. then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early (1959! due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

‘processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes. .

The Station also conducted a unilateral mail intercept operation,

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1953)

1. umaauconnce: REPRODUCTION pe On!

From the time the Mexico Station was opened (in April 794)
the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of. StationCin 1955; the Station ‘had

 

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile surveillance.team and a

mail] intercept operation.

 

 

 

i: Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by

 

 

 

handled by a Station case officer. The number

 

 

of lines tapped was limited only by the availability of a listening post

 

_ nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
-. American recruited agents. .
Three photographic sites were handied by a Station case officer —
--assisted by technicians on TDY From Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both.a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The'gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

SUBJECT: Review of Mexico City Station Files
at the Record's Center

 

 

 

 

1. On_2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture
visited the Record's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search of additional photographs of the
“unidentified man". We were unable to locate any such
photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have
been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and
that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters
for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed
and pertinent notations re re-use of the old folders:

SU"JECT: elay insending the first cable about
OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the dela (bt the Mexico
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book as a
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (wich
in my view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know what he was’ talking about).

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 October
convers ation ‘would have been picked up on theg
2nd of October. The Russian language portig#
to the Russ ian/English transcriber, on the
trans lation’ would have been returned 1 vi
at aich time, the Soviet case office

in the station before the 7th singe the’

Seywas picked up probably on

of the name alone but that wasn't the way Win Scott ran that
Station. He wanted the thotographic coverage tied in with the

license number. .It was also part of the "numbers game" of
