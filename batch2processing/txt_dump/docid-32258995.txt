United States Senator

1190C Wilchire Boulevard
Los Angeles, California

Dear Senator,

As a registered Democrat that has supported you in the
past, I find that I must now eall on you for help. I am
_writing to you on behalf of my husband, Loran E. Hall, who
has been having difficulty with several Federal governmental
agencies. : :
First, he recently applied for his DD-214, GI Eligibility

“for a home loan, through a local mortgage company. Hs was

subsequently informed that there had been a fire in the Records
Center in St. Louis and that there was no record of his
military service. Now what? :
: Secondly, he sent a request to the FAA Headquarters in
Oklahoma City for a duplicate copy af his pilot's license
and was told that they can find no record of that. I really
find that hard to believe.

If you will have your office contact us, I will be happy..
to supply you with all the necessary dstails. Any assistance

thet you can previde will be sincerely anpreciated. ’
Thanking you-in advance for your consideration and “proiipt

attention to this matter. 2S

Very truly yours,

Mes. Judith & Hall
