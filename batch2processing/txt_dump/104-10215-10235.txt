his whole career as President FEU.
29 November 1956: Batista's SIM agents picked up Dr. Armando de

had arrived carrying a machine gun and that he hid both for 4 days.
He also admitted under pressure that he was a homosexual and that
Cubela was his intimate friend. Source: Ours, from Cuban govern- |
ment official. Also reported that Carlos Prio Socarras, former

heme in the Camp Columbia Ags, Raul and Cubela were surprised while |
making obvious homosexual advances toward one another. Cubela later |
fell into disgrace with the regime. It is not kuown whether this was
due to his unsatisfactory performance as a student leader or whether
he had had a “Lover's Quarzel" with Raul. Source: Latin American
revolutionary who lived in Cuba until August 1962 and personally met
high Cuban officials. (Ed Note: Perhaps his performance as one-half

of the homosexual teag was unsetisfactory!!?)

This report called him an individual without principles or scruples,
greedy, ambitious, and one who would betray the regime without qualms
& should it suit his own interests. OPS #1139. (Ed Note: We must have
put this report out, for another card said the following: Among his ;
victims were Miguel Angel QUEVEDO y Lastra, the former editor of the ,
weekly magazine BOHEMIA (now in exile in ‘the. Us. and’ working for us;
however, it is true that QUEVEDO is and was openly known to be a ;
homos2xual, and one Dr. Cardenas, fnu, Chief Surgeon of the University
Hospital. However, it appears to the editor that source is speaking

of Dr. Armando de Cardenas Aranguren, a pathologist who admitted
homosexual relations with Cubela during an interrogation by SIM after
the killing of Lt. Col. Antonio BLANCO Rico. However, there is no
doubt that Cerdenas still considered himself a friend to Cubela and
as late as 1961 was trying to help get Cubela out of Cuba; this would
hardly be true if Cubela had been blackmailing him for years. There
are other indications that they appear to be good friends. In any case,
this type of blackmail could work both ways - the individuals con-
cerned could put the same charge against the blackmailer, no?:
December 1960: Following derog info subject: Gained prominence FEU
(Federacion Estudiantil Univrs‘tario) through Raul Castro. Common
knowledge that he sold out morally and poltically to Raul. Subject
actually shared quarters with Raul and much talk of homo relationships.
Subject became sort of mediator between Cowaie and anti-Commie groups
in University of Havana after January 1959. But soon his lack of. \
character and political force became known and Raul forced him upon i:
