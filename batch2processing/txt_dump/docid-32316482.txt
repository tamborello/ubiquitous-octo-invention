that CONNOLLY is the only one really, qualified to operate
the union, due to his pst experience. It is CONNOLLY's
opportunity to make himself a big man if he operates. the
union wisely and with "guts" in standing up to any meéiis:
who try to push him, ~ : : -7 : 7

: Informant felt that CONNOLLY started out. wrong
being connected in.any.way with PROVENZANO, but now —
that he is in,he could wholly disassociate himself from
PROVENZANO and get on his own,which would unite the
union behind him (CONNOLLY). —

NY T-2 again contacted on February 18, 1965,
advised that Mrs.” (FNU) GANNON is now.the clerk at
Local 707, having replaced EDDIE TOMIZEK, TOMIZEK is
apparently going to work in the office of Local 807,
TBT, which is in-the. same building. , : ;

formerly the private secretary of TOM HICKEY (now deceased),

former president of Local 807, IBT,. Upon HICKEY's death
GANNON became the secretary to JOHN STRONG, who became

the new president “of Local 807 after the death of HICKEY.
. Informant further advised that GANNON later went with

Local 707 for several years but left and has been absent
from the labor scene for sevewl years. Informant felt
that GANNON will be a valuable asset to Local 707 with

‘guys who look like "hoods" at the office of Local 707
since: the new officials assumed office. Informant did
not have any specific names but was only commenting on

' the looks of the individuals.

_ Informant further stated that- things are’ quiet
in the office of Local 707 and FRANK CONNOLLY, new -
Secretary-Treasurer, appears to be playing a lesser role
than previously anticipated. The new president, LOUIS ~
ALIMENA appears’ to be a strong man in the front for all
activities, at least in the first months of his new

- position,
