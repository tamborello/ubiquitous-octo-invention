A On June 10, 1968, Police Headquarters, Italian
National Police, Palermo, Sicily, made available the
following information:

. The trial of VINCENZO MARTINEZ and sixteen
other persons charged in Italy with aggravated criminal
conspiracy resumed on June 6, 1968. The attorney for
one of the defendants, SANTO SORGE, filed a motion re-
questing that all of the volumes of testimony issued by
the McClellan Subcommittee on Investigations be translated
into the Italian language. The court approved this motion
and another motion that the defendants be granted pro-
visional liberty because at least five months time would
be necessary to translate the Subcommittee testimony. -

declaring that the testimony of the McClellan Subcommittee
has already been translated into Italian, is in the hands
of Investigating Magistrate ALDO VIGNERI and available for
production in court, The court overruled itself and ordered
