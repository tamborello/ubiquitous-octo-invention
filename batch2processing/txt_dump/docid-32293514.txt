ReBulet,, 1/28/63, to New York and numerous other offices, *

Concerned with the investigation of "Causa Nostra," San Francisco
has noted the use of this term in numerous communications by
Eastern offices where the information obviously came from

misur coverage, Since SF-~2550-C-TE states that the correct
wording and spelling is "Cossa Nostra"---meaning "our thing,"
rather than “our cause," could it be possible that we have

taken the phonetic word as heard over misurs and given it the
wrong spelling and the wrong meaning?

It is the understanding of the San Francisco Office that the
word, "Causa," in Italian would be pronounced "cow" rather

than "coe." If the offices receiving copies of this com-
munication have run into this situation where the correct

word is "cossa" rather than "causa," it would be appreciated __
if they would promptly notify beth the Bureau and San Francisco.
These offices could very easily obtain this information from
the employees who monitor the misurs,
