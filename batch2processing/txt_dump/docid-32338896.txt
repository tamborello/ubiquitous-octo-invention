“Goaference Organizing Committee" of a “conference to strengthen American

'goviet relations’ held at Los Angeles on February 5, 1950.

BACKGROUND:

_As you know John Howard Lawson has been a long-time leader of
Comminist activities in the Hollywood area. He is one of the "Hollywood
fen" and has been convicted for contempt of Congress because of his refusal
to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1947.
His case has been under appeal to the Supreme Court, however, the Supreme
Court, on April 10, 1950, refused to review the case. He is considered a -
key figure in the Los Angeles Division and our investigation of him continues. .

: _ hos ‘Angeles bas advised that on February 5, 1950, a "Conference
Organizing Committee" held a."call to a@ conference to-strengthen American-
Soviet relations" at’ Parkview Manor in Los Angéles, on February 5, 1950.
fhig.meeting has been reported as having resulted in the formation of

the/ (Southern, California Council of American-Soviet Friendship."

LA~3287, a paid and reliable informant, advised that subject-

following: He said that American Imperialism started in 1918 and that
Willian C..Bullitt was in that year sent to Russia. He stated that it
was worthwhile for everyone to read United States Diplomatic Correspondence
of 1918 entitled "Russia! wherein one could find such correspondence as
"Russia is in the hands of a few men --mostly Jews," signed Winston Churchill
In the same correspondence Hoover wrote to Wilson in 1919, "The time has
arrived for ‘us to analyze Bolshevism, being formulated by the Jews." © Lawson
said the forces of évil;rour 19
terror reigned across ‘the land. He* sait that the die which was cast has not
changed very much ‘as: there are still ctgvo, “men ‘reigning terror across the land’. :
and both names are Hoover:-- Herbert Hoover and J- fdgar Hoover, doing
hatchet jobs on-pegple's rights. He said J. Bdgar Hoover was an apprentice
