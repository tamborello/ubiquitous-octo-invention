We have been conducting a hard-hitting aggressive
counterintelligence program against the UKA in the State of
North Carolina. This particular group was chosen-‘as the
focal point of our attack because North“Carolina has the
largest concentration of klansmen in the United States. It
is believed that if a death~dealing blow can be dealt to
the UKA in North Carolina, the entire Klan organization in

the United States will collapse. . <
