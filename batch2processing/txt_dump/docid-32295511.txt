authority of the various members, The chain of command runs
from STEFANO MAGADDINO through FREDRICO RANDACCIO to the
lowest members who are depicted on the bottom of the chart.

LA DUCA, ANTONIO MAGADDINO, JOHN Gc, MONTANA, and SALVATORE
PIERI represent individuals who act as counselors to STEFANO
MAGADDINO, although they may possess authority, such as
authority exercised by LA DUCA and PIERI which may or may not

BU 92-337

SAMUEL (COSMO) BROCATO, Bufile 73-12883
aka

PASCAL FRANK POLITANO, a former PCI of this
office, was a subject in a bank burglary investigation
in 1958 (Bufile 91-10250) in which prosecution was
declined. He is a former tavern operator who has most
recently received publicity after being arrested on an a
arson charge and being shot several times. His \
assailant was identified and is serving a sentence,

Indices of this office have numerous references
to PAUL A, BRIANDI, aka Bobby Ross, Paul Ross, FBI No,
375990. He has not been the subject of a substantive or
intelligence type investigation since his activities
did not apparently warrant the latter,

For information of the Bureau, positions of
importance assigned various individuals on attached chart
are not substantiated through investigations by Buffalo
Office, e.g, JAMES V, LA DUCA, ANTONIO MAGADDINO, SALVATORE
BONITO, SAM LAGATTUTA, etc. Highly Confidential Sources a
(HCS) of this office have repeatedly emphasized the position of s
FRED G, RANDACCIO, This chart also fails to show the
position and influence of such individuals as VINCENT A. SCRO /
and SAM RANGATORE as developed through HCS,
