Page 46 contains a very fanciful article which is supposed to relate
some of the high points of the Bureau career of former Special Agent Harvey Burstein,-
Wriiten in a very braggadocio manner, this item contends that Burstein made himself
invaluable to the FBI because he had the distinction of being the first Yiddish and
Hebrew speaking Special Agent, The article does make the point that BurStein was”
not the first member of the Jewish faith employed bypthe PBI, dr Sy web G/B

f ;

The article is replete with cldis that cannot be substantiated by a remiew
of Burstein’s personnel file, and with outright errors. He is identified as a wartime
Agent who, in 1941, was assigned to "all aspects of internal security, the tasks of
espionage and foreign intelligence, The war was raging in Europe, and tensions were
mounting between Japan and the United States."" Burstein actually entered the FBI on
8-25-41, as a clerk, and was assigned as a student fingerprint classifier. He resigned
his position on 6-22-42 to enter military service. He was reinstated on 7-26-48 as a

clerk, and did not receive an appointment as Special Agent until 10-25-48, He resigned
from the Bureau again on 8-14-53, having served in Chicago and Washindton Fiekt.

Re: SYLVAN LEBOW HARVEY BURSTEIN

   
    
 
  
    

The article, however, relates an incident that supposedly took place in 1941 with the
discovery by a citizen in New York City of a metal container supposedly containing a coded
message, .

i

 

A courier.was rushed to Washington with the "coded message," according |!

to the article, and orders were issued to "Get ‘Agent? Burstein on the double." The °

article goes on to state that Burstein entered a room where Agents were crowded around a :

desk on which the container rested. Burstein took one look and supposedly said: }

"Gentlemen, this is the Sh'ma, the basic credo of the Jewish faith--nothing to worry about"

‘The container was a mezuzah.

The article then states that down the long corridors of the FBI went the word,
that if "anything comes across any desk in a foreign language, call Burstein," i

INFORMATION IN BUFILES:

 

Bufiles contain no derogatory information identifiable with Sylvan Lebow,.
Harvey Burstein’s services were satisfactory, however, in a memorandum dated |
ij L1- 14-88, former Assistant Director Tamm set forth a summary of Burstein's FBI record, |
Mr. Tamm knew Burstein and said he felt he was an opportunist who had an exaggerated
:1 Opinion of his own ability; that he did not feel he could be trusted ror that he would do any-
| tine for the FBI except to use it to further his owi interests; and that he felt we should
deal with Burstein circumspectly. The Director noted, "I think this is a proper
evaluation,"

OBSERVATIONS:

We have been very circumspect in our relationship with Burstein and it is
felt nothing would be gained by calling his hand on this rather absurd article, It bears
out the evaluation made of the man in 1958. It is believed Mr. Lebow sent the magazine to
the Director because of the speech excerpts and the picture, and not in connection with the
article on Burstein,

RECOMMENDATION:

%* That the attached letter of thanks be forwarded to Sylvan Lebow for sending
the magazine to the Director.
