Memorandum to Mr. Rosen
Re: March on Washington
August 28, 1963
Summaries Re Principals Involved

,

. There are set forth below brief summaries concerning
the individuals who have been identified by literature
concerning the March and by Bureau sources as comprising the
principals in the event.

TRAEN:
2 s P i a ’ Cpasd
Roy Wilkins (age 62) “3 ree ft

Executive Secretary, NAACP .

Wilkins has been associated with the NAACP since
approximately 1931, During the 1930's and 1940's various
communist publications carried articles concerning Wilkins'
activities when those activities coincided with prosranms
sponsored by the Communist Party (CP). No information has
been received, however, that Wilkins has ever been sympathetic
to comatinist ideolory. It has been reported that Wilkins
has vigorously opposed communist infiltration in the NAACP
and through the years has advocated peaceful methods of
attaining racial equality... In June, 1963, he was arrested
in Jackson, Mississippi, on a local charge in connection with
integration activities.

A, Philip’Randolph (age 74) re ree
President, NALC creme

. Randolph has had a long career in the labor
movement and was founder and president for many years of

the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, He

was the subject of a security-type investigation in 1944

when allegations were received that he was affiliated with
various communist front groups, It was determined that in
1940 he had publicly announced withdrawal from one such

group because of reported conmtnist influence in the
organization and had, from time to time, disassociated himself
from other sroups for the same reason. His integration
activities have, at times, paralleled CP activities; however,
no information has been developed indicating Randolph is in
sympathy with communist aims, Randolph has also been an
advocate of pacificism.
