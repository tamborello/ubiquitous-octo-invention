that. time and thereafter ‘they have not been able to develop
any additional details, and MORA™“has not revealed any additional
information. n-

 

The Mexico. City. Office appreciates the Bureau's
position that this matter must be pursued in depth and that the
_informants should be made aware of the fact that the .questions
“raised by MORA’s original ‘information, eannot be left unanswered.
“The informants. ‘have been impressed ‘repeatedly with the need. to
follow this case aggressively. with MORA. and to clarify ‘the

original information, They. repeatedly have created. situations
which would open up a discussion of the previous information,
but have been met with an apparent total lack. of interest on
MORA's part. On 5/5/64 the informants pointed out that,
subsequent to MORA's | original indicpe ion of interest in press
reports. concerning the OSWALD case @&they, had repeatedly. called
her attention to various articles appearing in the press,
including an article in "Life" magazine, but received no: ,-
reaction whatsoever and no indication of interest. rw.

“Under instructions from this office the Aled

have ‘tried continuously to set up a two or three-day trip ‘out.
of Mexico City with MORA and her husband, FRANCISCO MORA, —

Definite arrangements were made on three "different occasions:
for the proposed trip, and on each occasion MORA was enthusiastic
about it, desiring to get away from the family and other problems
for a few days' rest and relaxation, Gn: each occasion, however ,
she postponed the trip due to financial problems with ‘the house
she and her husband are’ constructing, ill health of her mother,.
or ‘pressure of developments such as important visitors. arriving
in Mexico whom. she had ‘to attend. The informants made a final
effort to set up a meeting wit ORA following the week end of
5/9=10/64 and prior t HEE: 10" eHtparture for the United: Beater i/ w)
on 5/18/64, but MORA again clafmed that as much as she wanted
to take the trip and much.as.she needed the rest she would not
be able. to leave Mexico. City because of the. projects she had -
pending. It. does not appear. that it w be possible to set up
such a méeting- in the future in. view o plisx=1' espe turn to nef 4)

Both informants have expressed the belief that further
efforts to obtain more specific data from MORA on this matter — :
would be “working a dry well." On 5/5/64 ‘they advised. that in '
their opinion MORA's complete. loss of interest in the OSWALD ©
