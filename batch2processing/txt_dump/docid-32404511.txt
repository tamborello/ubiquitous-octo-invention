 

Talking Points with DDO on JFK Board Issues

HW 53217 DoclId

We are coming very close to finalizing what has been a significant resource draw on

both the DO and HRP/OIM over the past four years.

Most issues have been resolved satisfactorily through negotiation in good faith by the

Board and ourselves.

There is a desirability to resolving remaining issues in a way which does not result in

rancor or accusations of withholding by CIA—-If possible we would like to avoid an

appeal to the President.

There are, however, a number of documents upon which we have not been able to

come to resolution. Among them are:

¢ Elder Document (Angleton/embassy break-in). The EXDIR, without OIM
input, has decided to appeal this document. We believe that there is a
possibility the Board would take it off the table if, per their request, we
provide the true names of the idents to the cleared Board members (which are
incidently, available already in a widely dissiminated book on Angleton).

¢ Mexico City Station History. Chuck Briggs and Barry Harrelson are
continuing to negotiate between the DO and a JFK staffer on issues which are
peripheral to the JFK story.

¢ Directorate declarations which supported the EXDIR’s declaration of
Compliance. We have resisted provision of these “internal documents” to the
Board, and the IROs were led at the time of preparation to believe that they
would not be provided to the Board. However, as a last minute decision, the
Board has sought them as supporting “administrative records” which reflect
the extent of the searches conducted (comparable to what other agencies are
providing) If we’provided them, we would be in a position to delay further
review of sensitive material in these documents until at least the year 2017.
In our view we cannot legally withhold these documents if the Board declares
them “Assassination Records,” which they have the right to do. Provision of
these documents would enable us to close this issue and avoid further
controversy. The Fred Wickham has been unwilling to permit his declaration
to be provided.

¢ Ci History Pages. JFK Board Staff recommendations are currently being
reviewed by DO/CIC. We believe this can be resolved through discussions.

* Miscellaneous. There are a number of remaining documents on which we
have disagreements and in which we may lose some information, including
privacy information, but over which we are still discussing the details.

What is not solved today will go the Board and be voted upon either this afternoon or

tomorrow and we need to have the DO’s final view on providing the idents on Elder

and the DO declaration as well as authority to negotiate the remain peripheral issues.

T would like to call Judge Tunheim and suggest further discussions between him and

myself which would be final. : :
