oil leases. HUNT had bid $3,000,000 and put up enough money

is 300,000 to 400,000 cases of tomatoes short and is still
interested in buying the canneries. He said that HUNT is
involved with someSreedan movement and is presently occupied
but it is going to be all right and they are all going to
made a lot of money. CIVELLO then requested source to put
AL back on thephone who informed CIVELLO that he was going to
Las Vegas and will be staying at the Tropicana Hotel.

Beverly Hilcrest Hotel, Room 604, MARSHAL called JOE
CIVELLO at about 6:15 PM, at AD8-6983, and put source on the
phone. Source told JOE GIVELLO that FRANK was sick in the
hospital and source desired to protect FRANK's interest and to
see that anything FRANK had coming went to his mother, be-
cause he did not think FRANK was going to make it. JOE said
that he could not come out and for source to tell Dr. JOE
DESIMONE, brother of FRANK, that he would not come out for the
funeral, in the event of FRANK's death, because of the em-
barrassment it might cause the family. JOE asked source to
kep in touch with him on this matter,

 

Source and MARSHAL then had dinner at the hotel.
MARSHAL talked about the news in the papers about cheating
at the Friar's Club in Beverly Hills and said that he knows
HARRY KARL, whose name was mentioned in the newspapers on
7/27 and’ 7/28/67. MARSHAL said that he would like to bring
a guy from Minnesota to take off some rich suckers in Palm
Springs. (It is noted that BILLY DOUGLAS, true name VERNELL
FURLONG, is from Minnesota and a subject in the current
Friar's Club investigation in Los Angeles, in the case
captioned, "JOHN ROSSELLI, aka ET AL, ITAR - GAMBLING -
PURGERY, Los Angeles 166- 1048", ) MARSHAL also mentioned that
TONY GIZZ0 put out the contract to kill CHARLES BANAGIO on
4/6/50; in Kansas City.

 

Source invited MARSHAL to source's residence for
dinner on the night of 6/3/67. MARSHAL mentioned that he ‘
was expecting a $1,700 cashier's check on 8/4/67 and wanted
source to cash it for him. They discussed the Friar's Club
and MARSHAL mentioned that he had met JOHN ROSSELLI once when
ROSSELLI had just been released from prison-and was intro-
duced by FRANK DESIMONE, at the Beverly-Wilshire Hotel, about
13 years ago. He never saw him again. MARSHAL, according
to source, is extremely knowlegeable, and has a pnominal
memory for names, dates, and places.

MARSHAL attempted to call source on 6/3/67, from
Dallas, did not reach source who was in the hospital. Source
received a letter from MARSHAL on 6/6/67, with a return address
of Kirkwood Hotel, but it did not furnish any information of
value. Again on 6/6/67, source received a call from AL MARSHAL
from the Kirkwood Hotel. Source informed MARSHAL that the
California cannery owners would not deal with HUNT or his re-
presentative because of previous problems in particular because
HUNT has tried to buy at a ridiculous low price. MARSHAL said
he was surprised and was going to call Dallas and tell JOE
CIVELLO about this development, MARSHAL said that HUNT's
purchasing agent lives across the street from CIVELLO.
MARSHAL said he would have CIVELLO call source on the morning
of 6/7/67, in order for source to explain this development
personally.

 

On 6/7/67,° at about 11:15 AM, JOE CIVELLO called
source and left a message that he would call back at 11:30 AM.
CIVELLO did call back at about that time at a pay phone and
told source that HUNT's man lives across the street from him.
He said that HUNT is tight with money and crazy. He told
source that he is going to have to find a cannery that HUNT
has not quoted a price or a price or make arrangements to
build two canneries for HUNT. He also has other people in-
terested in buying the same deal. He hoped source could
put this together and they could make some money together.
CIVELLO said that he did not think AL did anything wrong and
pressed the point that it was not AL's fault because he did
not know. CIVELLO told source to keep in touch with AL, who
would keep CIVELLO informed of the progress. Source called
AL MARSHAL on 6/13/67, at the Statler-Hilton Hotel, Washington,
D. C., and related to him information he had received from
RALPH BRIGANTINO that the GANGI Brothers wanted a million and
a half for their cannery. RALPH suggested that they could add
$150,000 on the price so the buyer would not know this to be
the brokerage fee. RALPH suggested he would receive 25 percent
of the $150,000, and would give 75 percent to source to share
with his people. Source told MARSHAL to relate this information
to CIVELLO. :

anything on the canneries. ‘

‘concerning his experience and knowledge and contacts with |
AL MARSHAL, FBI No. 479 888, JOSEPH CIVELLO, JOSEPH IANNI,
and NICHOLAS. CIVELLA:

In December 1966, source was contacted by CARL
THOMPSON, runner and reported bag man for attorney HARRY
WEISS, concerning KENNETH CHILDS of Wichita, Kansas, who was
on Federal Probation and who desired his probation be terminated.

 

, In an. effort to determine the contacts of FRANK a
DESIMONE (Los Angeles LCN Boss, deceased 8/4/67), source i
mentioned the CHILDS matter to DESIMONE on 1/1/67, when *
both were at the residence of Attorney JOHN MARSHAL, DESIMONE
suggested they take a ride, Source and DESIMONE went to a
public phone nearby, on Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles. DESIMONE
called the Kirkwood Hotel, Des Moines, Iowa, phone 515-244-9191,
and asked for AL MARSHAL, stating Mr. FRANK was calling. He
told MARSHAL to go to a pay phone and call him back at the pay
phone DESIMONE was calling from. MARSHAL did call back and
DESIMONE introduced source to MARSHAL on the phone who explained
the CHILDS matter. MARSHAL said he knows Judge WESLEY BROWN's
best friend, in Wichita, who is a corporation lawyer and he
was sure the matter could be handled in obtaining termination
of probation for CHILDS. MARSHAL said he would go to Wichita
and return Wednesday. .

 

DESIMONE came back on the phone with MARSHAL and
after hanging up, told source that MARSHAL needed $300 expense ‘
money. Source agreed and on the following day, 1/2/67, he
sent $300 by Western Union Money Order to AL MARSHAL, Kirkwood
Hotel, signed Mr. DAN.

On 1/3/67, at about 11:30 AM, MARSHAL called source
advising he was going to Wichita on 1/4/67, and would be in.
Los ‘Angeles on 1/6/67. He said he had to come to Los Angeles
any way because he has a large civil suit pending in court.

When source advised DESIMONE on the same day,
DESIMONE said that source should not give MARSHAL any more
money for expenses. If money is. needed, it should be placed
in escrow and DESIMONE would be glad to act as the escrow.

On 1/5/67, MARSHAL called source from Wichita at
- about 11:35 AM, advising he was staying at the Broadview

Hotel, Room 429.. He said there is nothing any one can do
concerning CHILDS getting off Federal Probation in Wichita.
According to MARSHAL, CHILDS was about to be indicted both
Federally and locally concerning a security theft of $3,000,000.
He said he had been in touch with Judge BROWN's best friend,
and had been advised that the matter could not be pursued.
MARSHAL wanted $200 more for expense money and requested
source to ask DESIMONE to call MARSHAL that evening.

 

Source called DESIMONE the same day and after each
of them going to a pay phone, source related his conversation
with MARSHAL. DESIMONE said that's the way it goes and source
should not give MARSHAL any more money. DESIMONE said he
would call MARSHAL as requested.

On 3/24/67, source received a letter from MARSHAL
on Kirkwood Hotel stationery, advising that he was going to
come out to Los Angeles that week and wanted to meet with
source and DESIMONE. Enclosed was a sealed envelope marked,
FRANK D., Personal, with instructions for source to give it
to DESIMONE. Source gave the envelope to DESIMONE on 3/27/67, i
who read it and then handed it to source. The message read ;
to the effect that nothing was going on and the law suit had
bogged down. He wanted to seeFRANK and source and talk
business. '

Source subsequently mentioned to FRANK DESIMONE
that Attorney HARRY WEISS has a pending Internal Revenue Tax
case and WEISS might be indicted. DESIMONE said he would mention
it to AL MARSHAL.
