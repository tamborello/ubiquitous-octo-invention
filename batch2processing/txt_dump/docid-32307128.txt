MANUEL RAY

 

formerly in the Intelligence Service in Cuba, stated that he
had never heard. of anyone hearing ESTEVEZ denounce the
communist system, but only "CASTRO and company." FERNANDEZ
estimates that JURE has approximately one hundred fifty members
in the Los Angeles area, and it cooperates with another
anti-CASTRO organization, Alphe 66, which has approximately
fifty members. He states that he has heard that JURE is putting
out propaganda now that they will invade Cuba by May 20, 1964.

fornia, who resides at 1008 Vest 37th Strect, San Pedro, Cali-
fornia, advised that MAN GONZALEZ, an employee of Felix

MANUEL RAY

On March 12, 1964, JOSE GIRALDEZ, a Cuban source
who resides at 2109 Zoe Street, Huntington Park, California,
when being interviewed concerning another matter, advised
that JOSE ESTEVEZ, whom he does not know personally, was
reputed to be a delegate of MANUEL RAY and in charge of
activities of JURE in Los Angeles. GIRALDEZ stated that he
heard MANUEL RAY speak in Los Angeles about three months
ago as either leader of JURE or Segundo Frente Escambrey,
and he endeavored to sell bonds at $92.00 each in order to
raise money to bring about the overthrow of CASTRO. According
to GIRALDEZ, RAY told of the struggle in Cuba. GIRALDEZ
stated that it is rumored that JURE has in it many who were
formerly members of the July 26th Movement and others who
were pro-FIDEL CASTRO.

On March 19, 1964, JOSE FERNANDEZ, a Cuban source
who resides at 812 Waterloo Street, Los Angeles, California,
while being interviewed concerning another matter stated
that he does not know JOSE M. ESTEVEZ personally but knows
of him and some of his activities. He stated that he heard
ESTEVEZ speak recently in Los Angeles at a meeting of JURE. es
He stated that ESTEVEZ did not make any statements which were,
of a questionable nature, but pointed out that ESTEVEZ formerly
held the rank of Captain with the CASTRO forces. and was .
President of a tribunal of five that decided on punishment
for the foes of CASTRO, which included the followers of
BATISTA, as well as those individuals who had previously been
with CASTRO and turned against him. Mr. FERNANDEZ stated
that at the time ESTEVEZ held this position in Cuba he was
a staunch supporter of CASTRO and was.loud in his praise of
the Soviet Union and the communist system. He stated that
eventually ESTEVEZ grew to dislike and hate CASTRO as a leader
and left Cuba; however, he never turned against the communist
ideology or the communist system of government, which CASTRO ~
had initiated. Mr. FERNANDEZ stated that ESTEVEZ is in charge .
of JURE in California, and shares the opinion of MANUEL RAY,
as both want to overthrow CASTRO and his regime in order that
RAY and his group can replace them. FERNANDEZ, who was
