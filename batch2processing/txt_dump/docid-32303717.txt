the ownership of OSCAI RD, a known associate of, RUGGIERO BOIARDO,
In November, 1950, GIRARD sold The Grotto to JOSE Ss, a

relative, and JAMESXPROCACCINA, both of Newark, Although there //

was no date of termination given in the record, it was noted that
The Grotto had had repeated citations for various violations,
the last being in September, 1953. ;

In 1952, The Grotto was described as a favorite hoodlum
hangout and it was alleged that TONY BOY BOIARDO had a financial
interest in it. In September, 1955, NK 1846-C reported that
following a vacation period, fhe Grotto was scheduled to reopen
on 9/12/55, but had not yet done so on 9/27/55, The site on which
The Grotto stood has since been included in a large tract used
for a freeway and housing project, both of which have been completed
for at least five years.

All references in Newark indices to HARRY, HAROLD, LITTLE
HARRY and LITTLE HAROLD have been reviewed, but none could be
identified with the victim, In additional] jewelers listed in
the classified section of Newark city directories for the period
1937 to 1957, with a first name of HARRY or HAROLD, were searched :
through indices with negative results, ‘

In the event NK 2251-C* or any other source provides
additional information which might lead to the identification
of RUSSO's victim, appropriate action will be taken,

Concerning the reference in relet to the physical layout
. of RUGGIE RDO's Livingston estate, Agents who interviewed
“po him on the premises have advised that the grounds occupy about 20
“acres of which much is woodland, There are four houses on the
property; BOIARDO's own residence and one each occupied by a
married daughter, There is at least one large barn and several
out buildings, The main house is at the end of a lane winding
about 200 yards from a semi-rural road, The Agents observed
that for a considerable distance to the rear of the house, there
were gardens, animal and bird cages and statuary; however,
because of the rolling terrain, no greenhouse was visible.

Newark will remain alert for any opportunity to survey
BOIARDO's estate discreetly in order to locate the pit described
by RUSSO:
