one of the most aggressive and well-organized criminal combinations
operating in the eastern part of the U.S. Gabriel Mannarino

Pittsburgh advises that a rustic 4-room cottage is
currently being constructed for Sam Mannarino in a remote area
near New Kensington, Pa. PG 545-C has obtained information -
indicating the cottage will be turned over to Gabriel Mannarino

Re SAC Letter dated 6/11/59 stressing the necessity for
being alert to. situations in which extraordinary techniques
could be used to advantage. .

Pittsburgh national top hoodlums GABRIEL and SAM MANNARINO
head one of the most aggressive and well organized criminal
combinations operating in the eastern part of the United States
today. GABRIEL MANNARINO attended the conference of hoodlums
at Apalachin, N..¥., on 11/14/57. His-present status in the
matter entitled "UNITED STATES vs, BONANNO, ET AL" (BUFILE
92-4225) is that of an un-indicted co-conspirator.

The MANNARINO mob is currently under investigation in
connection with two major theft matters with international
ramifications. One case involves an alleged plot to

finance FIDEL CASTRO's 26th July Movement through the :
Proceeds of twelve million dollars worth of stolen Canadian
bonds, jewelry and cash, apparently in exchange for

exclusive slot machine and gambling casino rights following
the defeat of the BATISTA Government. The other matter
concerns a conspiracy to transport weapons stolen from a a
National Guard Armory in Ohio to assist in the rebel movemefst, :
during the uprising in Cuba. ae

 

.Recently unverified reports,have been received from a MANNARINO

confederate confined to the Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg,
Pa., linking SAM MANNARINO with a conspiracy to smuggie opium
and heroin into the United States during 1956 through sources
of supply in Guatemala and Mexico.

Since the inception of the Top Hoodlum Program the Pittsburgh
Office has waged a vigorous campaign against the MANNARINO
organization and has long recognized the urgent need for
coverage at a regular meeting place. Early in the Top Hoodlum

PG 66-24635.%: o

New Kensington, were urged to remain alert for evidence

of any new homes or buildings under construction for either
of the MANNARINO brothers.

PG 545-C on 12/4/59 reported that the Fiorina and Murin
Construction Company, known front for the MANNARINO mob,

was then in the process of completing a rustic, four room,
cottage for SAM MANNARINO, located on a secluded and densely
wooded ten acre hillside tract approximately two hundred yards
off the Shearsburg Road in Allegheny- Township, Pa. Asa
matter of information, Allegheny Township is a small village
located in a remote area near New Kensington.

 

The, informant recalled that during 1956 when he was hekping
SAM MANNARINO acquire over three hundred acres of.land’in the
Same area, MANNARINO remarked that he might use, one of the
tracts as a possible site for a lodge. Moreover, the informant
recalled MANNARINO specifically mentioned that the lodge,

if constructed, would be used as a meeting place and stop-
over point for out of state associates on cross-country
trips. The informant also remembered MANNARINO mentioning
that the land in Allegheny Township would be ideally suited
for such an undertaking because of the secluded nature of

the area.

On 12/15/59, PG 545-C was requested to contact SAM and
GABRIEL MANNARINO in their office at the Ken Iron and Steel i
Company for the purpose of obtaining additional information

regarding the cottage in Allegheny Township. During

conversation with the MANNARINO brothers on the afternoon

of 12/15/59, the informant learned that SAM MANNARINO had
turned over the ten acre tract on which the cottage is
located to his brother GABRIEL and that the cottage would be zy
GABRIEL MANNARINO's new summer home. The informant was :
present when the MANNARINO brothers discussed plans to move

certain pieces of furniture from their respective homes into

the new cottage once it: is completed.

Informant stated that judging from the actions and. expressions
of the MANNARINOs in discussing the new construction in
Allegheny Township, it was obvious to him that the cottage
would actually be the private meeting place mentioned by

‘SAM MANNARINO in 1956, and not GABRIEL MANNARINO's summer
home.
