will be a mutt installed in a lamp operating at approximately
38.5 megacycles. This lamp is part of the regular furniture
presently located in the motel office. After installation,

it will be returned to its original place in the office and

the installation will therefore constitute a trespass. The
telephone instrument in the motel will not be utilized in any manner.
- Type of case involved:

PECORA is under development as a Top Echelon Criminal Informant,
having symbol number NO 1283-PC. In the past, he has also been
the subject of an AR case. He is a known associate of such well-
known hoodlums as JOSEPH PORETTO, HENRY ERNST, and THOMAS

AMATO, In the late 1950's when the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
listed suspected Mafia members, PECORA was on this list. The
Tropical Tourist Court is a known hangout for hoodlums, such

as those mentioned above. . :

7. Connection or status of subject in the case:

PECORA. is the principal subject in this case.

8. Specific information being sought:

It is felt this coverage may develop information as to the
existence of a La Cosa Nostra group in New Orleans. It is
also felt that this coverage will develop information as to
the identity of individuals contemplating major crimes in
the South Central States, as persons frequenting this motel
office are well-known major criminals.

9. Reasons for believing the specific information will be obtained by the
technical surveillance: : .

It is felt specifically that any conversations between JOSEPH ;
'PORETTO and PECORA Gould very well be the link to determining : |
the identity of La Cosa Nostra members in the Greater New
Orleans area. Both PORETTO and PECORA are well-known associates ;

of CARLOS MARCELLO, suspected head of any. "family" in New :
Orleans. .

10. Importance of case and subject: , : -

This coverage will represent the first technical coverage in
the New Orleans Office of a suspected Mafia member and at
present there is no technical coverage inexistence that would

develop this type of information. To date, no information has
been developed through live informants concerning La Cosa
Nostra membership in the New Orleans or Louisiana area.

11. Possibilities of obtaining desired information by other means
(Explain in detail): ; ;

As noted previously, New Orleans has been unable to develop
information concerning the existence of La Cosa Nostra in New
Orleans or Louisiana through live informants. In order to
develop PECORA into a top echelon criminal informant, it is
not felt at the present time that direct contact with him
would result in his providing any information concerning
La Cosa Nostra or information he might have concerning the
activities of the major criminals and hoodlums in the Louisiana
area. During previous contacts with PECORA, he has provided
no information of significance and in such instances has been
uncooperative. :

12. Risks.of detection involved: .
The misur will be a radio operation with no wiring from the
building and no contact with the telephone company necessary.
As the radio will be completely concealed within a lamp,
which is presently part of the office equipment at the motel,
it is felt that the risks of detection with this type of
equipment are negligible. : :

13. Probable length of technical surveillance:
90 days

14. Request made for technical surveillance by any outside agency
(name specific official, title and agency) :

None
