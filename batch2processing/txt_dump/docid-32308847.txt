Miami informant, MM-639S, advised on 8-13-58 he ‘had / eceived
_information Cuba Rebelde, Cuban revolutionary organization,.. -headed i

(/Agans by. Jos avAleman , owner ofthe Tradewinds Hotel, Miami, plans” ‘. .

Taunch — expedit nm against Cuba composed of 200 to 300 members of Cuba
Rebelde. It is reported they will land fully armed in Pinar del Rio
Province, Cuba, and establish a second front. The informant learned the
Cuba Rebelde has rifles, carbines, machine guns, mortars and hand grenades
but still needs rifle grenades which would be obtained in about four days.
Miami has advised Customs and. we disseminated the information to State,
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the armed. services intelligence
agencies, the Department, Immigration . and Naturalization Service (INS) -
and to Customs here, on 8-14-58. L (uy mn

‘This again involves possible violations of statutes under our
jurisaiction (organizing a military or naval expedition, Title 18,
ection 960 usc) and possible illegal exportation of arms under the -

; jurisdiction of Customs, We have an agreement with Customs that if we

receive an allegation of arms violation we will refer it to Customs and
Customs will handle all matters arising therefrom, On the other hand
if we receive an allegation of possible violation of Section 960, we
would handle even though it was subsequently developed arms were involved.
This case does not fall squarely under the agreement because the .
allegation which we received first, alleges both a possible violation
under our jurisdiction and an arms violation under the jurisdiction of
Customs, It is not believed, therefore, that we could insist that
Customs handle all phases of the case at this time. Customs, however,
has seizure powers which we do not have and can make arrests and seize
arms without warrants, In the event arms are about to be started on
their way, Customs would haye an immediate violation. and would no doubt
make the seizures ‘and-arrests, Our Violation would not come into
existence until the expedition. leaves», While, our relations with Customs
are such that we could participate ‘inthe arrests with Customs, since
Customs has seizure powers which we do not have and arrests would be made ,,
without warrants on short notice, i gould appear inadvisable for us...ta.
