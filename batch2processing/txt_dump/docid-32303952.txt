On July 9, 1965, EILEEN CURRY telephonically
advised that she was unsuccessful in her effort to ascertain

“The information obtained from the Geneva, Ohio

SPRAGUE, who has requested that her identity be protected.
The information relating to telephone numb er YE22-2614
was furnished by CS CV-506-S,

It is recognized that the investigative period
of this report is somewhat lengthy; however, this case is
presently in the process of being presented to te Federal
Grand Jury and the United States Marshal has been experiencing
difficulty in locating witnesses for service of subpoenaes,
and Assistant United States Attorney JAMES J, CASEY, who
has been handling the presentation, has been busy with other
matters and a tour of duty with the National Guard. All
investigative leads have been covered immediately and it is
felt that submission of an earlier report would have been
for status purposes only.
