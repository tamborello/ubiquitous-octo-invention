12, Miss| said that she believed that she could obtain
additional inform: nm about Novel by writing to a friend of hers,
Mr. Aaron M. Kohn, who is the managing director of the
Metropolitan Crime Commission in New Orleans. She asked whether
there was any objection to her doing so. She was told that there
was no objection as long as her inquiry was couched within the
frame of reference of her own business and had nothing to do with
CIA. She then penned a note to Mr. Kohn, inquiring about Novel
as a customer of her service and read it aloud. She was assured
that there was no objection. She added that Mr. Kohn had done fine
jobs of cleaning up first Denver, then New Orleans, (Comment:
Kohn is a firm antagonist of Garrison.) Miss cautioned
that she may not get a reply for several weeks. She will give CIA
any information about Novel that Kohn may provide.

13. Novel's motives remain obscure. As was reported earlier,
there is a clear possibility that he remained an ally of Garrison
after their seeming antagonism developed. If so, his efforts to link
himself publicly with CIA could be part of Garrison's attack upon
the Agency. This theory would also explain Novel's relationship to a
Garrison crony like Willard Robertson. Another possibility is that
the feudis genuine. (Novel has made very strong accusations against
Garrison in major radio broadcasts; these include charges of
occasional homosexuality and possible direct involvement in the
alleged murder of David Ferrie.) Mis formed a clear
impression that Novel's dislike of Garrison is genuine. If so, his
persistent attempts to link himself to CIA may be part of a campaign
to create for International Dynamics Corporation an aura of prestige

as a result of supposed ties to the federal government. He listed the
U.S. government with{ has one of his clients. His |
relationship to Willard Robertson might then be explained by his

repeated assertion that he has a penetration in Garrison's entourage.

6. Novel told Mis that he had been associated in
some way with Senator Robert Kennedy. (Comment: The reference
may have been to Walter Sheridan, who served as an investigator
for Robert Kennedy when the latter was Attorney General. )

location and then to record the calls in Washington. She said no.

8. Novel listed his own current address as 566 E. Main St. ’

context), and William Turner (a staff writer for Ramparts who has
been closely associated with Garrison and his investigation). Novel
also told Mis that he has a penetration of Garrison's

penetration he learned that he was to appear prominently in a

Ramparts article which would list him as a client o
Chand would also list jas a Cover or

front for CIA operations cae with internal (i.e., domestic)

 

 

affairs. Novel told Miss not to be concerned because he
had sent word back to Garrison that if such an article appeared,
‘)would sue. He later learned that the idea of
publishing such an article had been dropped. He told this story to
ith the air of one who had done her a favor. Miss
had the impression, however, that Novel himself did not
e allegation about her firm and CIA.
