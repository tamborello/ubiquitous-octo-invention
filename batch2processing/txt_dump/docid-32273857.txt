Dear Dr. Rhoads:

in the course of preparing their report, the staff of

the Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States
has indicated a need to have access to CIA material either
located in or designated for storage in Presidential
Libraries. As you are undoubtedly aware, a good deal of
this material is maintained on a segregated basis at CIA's
Archives and Records Center. Other material is actually
located in the libraries under your custody.

The matter of at¢éss to’ these documents has been. raised’

‘with Mr. Colby and he has requested that I.ask you to make ~
whatever arrangements are necessary to permit. access: to any |
CIA material in the Presidential Library system upon the re-
quest of Mr. David W. Belin,:.Executive Director of -the Com-
mission staff or by any other staff member designated by him.
It is our desire that such access be permitted regardless of
‘classification of the documents and in any manner that would
_be consistent with your procedures. If it would be helpful.
to you, I would be pleased to assist in facilitating arrange-
ments between the Commission staff and whomever you designate
to work on this matter.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Blake:
In response ‘to your lettar of May 20, 1975, concerning a request

by the Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States for
access to CIA materials located in the Preaidentiol | library systen,

 

the materials "regardless of classification” was ineluded ‘with our
noti¢e to the libraries.

Since CIA materiale may be found in numerous files among a library's
holdings, it will be necessary for a library staff member to work
closely with the Commission's representative to identify the perti-
new’ material and to correlate thesa materials whith documents from -
other agencies whose permission for aécess has béan sought and

“granted. Therefore, in order to facilitate accesa, Mr. David W.

 

, Executive Ditector of the Commission, showild contaet the
library directors individually regarding specific a¥Yangeménts, for
authorized members of the Commission staff to vieit a particular |
library.

A tist of the Presidential libraries, their addresses, and the names
of their directors {1s attac¢hed. If there is any way in which I may
be of further asaistanés, please don't hesitate to ¢all.
