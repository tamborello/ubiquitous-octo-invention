ffice or one of the directorates)? What DCI brie: ill exist for the
eriod August 1, 196 1964?
Answer 10:

If the ODCI briefed the Office of the President, then there would be a briefing book with
any background material and notes in the folders retired for that DCI’s term.

If the briefing were to be given by another directorate, it should have been filed on a
temporary basis within the ER files and not retired.

The following briefing books during that timeframe were located in our records:

1DEC63 - Key Elements of Soviet Military & Economic Strengths

(1284A/10)
DCI (McCone) Meetings with the President (Johnson) 3 folders
(1285A/5- 6).
ion LU: records might still exi on any eCone information from
the directorates following the assassination? For example, any request o1 ilanc

ie i i ion during LHO’s visit.”

Answer 11: Warren Commission folder holds a document to David Berlin/EXDIR/WC
stating that Mexico City Station did take photographs. Hill briefing on Oswald indicating
that we were not surveilling him at the time of his visit to Mexico City. The McCone files
have recently been recalled by history staff. Thus far in the efforts of this search, | have
not located any reference to DCI taskings to the directorates.

MEMORANDUM FOR DCVIRO
winu: encree “S86 R—

DATE: April/May 1997
SUBJECT: - Proposed Topics/Questions for DCI Office Briefings to ARRB
FROM: , DC/DCVER

. ACTION TAKEN: Since documents in this timeframe were not logged into a searchable

system, AARC keyword and visual shelf list searchs were utilized.. Executive Registry has
identified seven (7) shelf lists containing documents during the referenced timeframe (60’s
to mid-70’s):

80M01009A
80M01048A
-80R01284A
80B01285A
80R01580R
80B01676R
80RO1731R.

Each question was treated as a separate search effort with appropriate keyword and
AARC shelf list searches/reviews. Due to the timeframe, many of the applicable boxes are
being utilized by historians at the present time (shelf lists are annotated accordingly). As
of 30 April thrity-three (33) boxes of documents have been recalled/reviewed.

ion 1: How e rec of the DCI, DDCI and the heads of the directorates
indexed? : :

Answer I: The records which pass through Executive Registry are incorporated into.our
subjectitopic files. Front Office working files which are turned over to the registry as a
DCI/DDCI/EXDIR leaves the position are categorized by material type; i.e.,
calendars/cards, meetings, trips, chronos, etc. High level weekly meetings are
categorized by agency name: NSC, STATE, DEFENSE, ATTORNEY GENERAL, etc.

Juestion 2: In a Cold Warrior foomote, To 1M ngold reports that as any of Cl
hief James Angleton’s files were destroye: complete record was carefully maint ‘ned
what had been-don Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI’s office

was notified. (p. 143) What records would the DCI’s office have maintained on this
destruction?

 

 
13-00000

Answer 2: The keywords ANGLETON & KALARIS were utilized in this search; plus
through the perusal of shelflists a folder with DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION was
reviewed. The folder with “destruction” in the title contained paramaters set for
retention of documents during the various investigations/committees. None of the reviews
surfaced any authorization or reference to or listing of Angleton documents being
destroyed. If the timeframe for the said destruction were provided and the position held
by Kalaris were known, the appropriate DCI Chronos and position liaison files could be
searched.

uestion 3: ich office controls the unredacted version of the Family Jewels memo?

Answer 3: Executive Registry shelf lists record two (2) retired boxes containing material
identifiable as “Family Jewels” . At the present time those two boxes are being utilized

. by the DCHIRO for the Levy search. (79MO1476A; boxes 16 & 17). One of the testimony

documents located in a folder titled “White House Correpsondence re: Congressional
Investigations” referenced the “Family Jewels”. Per a conversation with DCIIRG on
30 April. 1997, the GC has found the unredacted version.

 

Ling hi wake of. the i ¥ 963-Se ember 3

Answer 4: The shelf lists for the above timeframe did not indicate high level meetings
with either of the two agencies, therefore, the NSA and FBI liaison folders for 1963/1964
were reviewed. There were no responsive documents in these compartments. The
McCone files are under review by David Borage.
