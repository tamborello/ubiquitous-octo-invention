On November 21, 1956, PG 545-C, who in the past has supplied reliable
information, advised SA JOHN S. PORTELLA that about one month ago he was” {7
talking with "Hog" WILSON, Merwin, Pennsylvania, regarding an option on wy

a real estate agent in New Kensington, was also interested in the land.
Informant said he had heard that both the Aluminum Company of America and
Westinghouse had this land site in mind for a research center and informant
could not understand MORAN's interest in the property. Informant said he .
went to MORAN and talked to him about the property and MORAN denied that
he was interested in it in any sense, Informant said that on the same date {('|, }
he went to SAM INO's office at the Nu-Ken Iron and Steel Company and

saw on SAM's desk a note from MORAN, who wanted SAM to call him back imme- (|)
diately about the WILSON. property. Informant said he never connected MORAN d
with the MANNARINOs until this incident. Informant said that since this
incident he has talked to MANNARINO, who has indicated that he does now
have an interest in the WILSON property. Informant described WILSON as an
old millionaire farmer who owns thousands of acres in the New Kensington
area and who also owns a large part of the Kiski Bank. Informant advised

cash. Informant said that MANNARINO recently purchased 300 acres at $100
an acre near Weinels Crossing and MANNARINO has told informant that he has

brother KELLY MANNARINO and informant has no idea where KELLY is getting it.
