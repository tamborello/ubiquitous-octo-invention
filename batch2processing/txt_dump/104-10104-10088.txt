arreigoament in March 1967. He was indicted along with ©3
Rolande Masferrer fer plotting an invasion of Haiti, mcf ___|
said that they had ne operational interest in Leen, but sources
had indicated Leon might be.considered a political asest in the post
Davallier era in Halti. Mr, ked my opinion as te
whether or net this possible use of Leon might have an
effect on ges being dropped against him. I teld

Mr. ( that it seemed highly unlikely that the Judge or

the United States Atterney would consider dropping the charges

since Leon had failed to appear befere the court when eo ordered,

 

2 {called Mr. Morris, Internal Security Divisien,
Department of Justice, the attorney handling beth the Masferrer
and Bosch prosecutions, and teld him that Leen had been arrasted.
it wae in a previcus conversation with Mr. Morris that he teld
me that the United States Attorney expected to obtain the indictment
ageinat Bosch on 31 May 1967. Myr. Merris said that both the
United States Attorney and the Department of Justice were
considering pestpening the date of bringing the tadictment against
Beech because of the problems which had develeped in Miami after
a Cuban refugee named Rivere had been arrected. The information
available indieates that Orlande Besch has been the leader af the
protest demonstrations against Rivere’s arrest. & would therefore
seem prudent te delay the indictment rather than precipitate
greater demonstrations ia the Cuban community of Miami.
