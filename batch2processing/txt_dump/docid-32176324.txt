first two years of the FPCCts existence there was a struggle

intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any
other organization, This source stated that Lee believed
that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the United States and should
support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution
without interference from other nations, Lee did not
advocate supporting the Cuban revolution per se. v)

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York
Times" reported that Senator Thomas J, Dodd of Connecticut
had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of
the Castro network in the United States." It is to be noted

that Senator Dodd was a member of the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on [v)
the FPCC,

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York
World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro
FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime
activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro- . !
Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, and the |
|

direction of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal
travel-to-Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of
life was attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public
opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed
FPCC financing by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and
ultimately, the bad publicity which the FPCC received from
disclosure of activities on its’ behalf by suspected (o}

presidential assassin Lee H. wald,
