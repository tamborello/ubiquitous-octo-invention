il. “Recording to an ini erceptea phone call in Mexico City; Lee OSWALD
was at the Soviet Embassy there on 28 September 1963 and spoke with the.
Consul, Veleriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOY. ‘This was learned when OSWALD called .
the Soviet Exbessy on 1 October, identifying himself by name and speaking
“broken Russian, steting the above and asking the. guard who answered. the phone
whether there vas. "enything new concerning the telegram to Washington." -

The guard checked and then told OSWALD thet a request had been sent, but Sool.
nothing hed as yet been received. (MEXI 6453, 9 October 1953) The FBE liatson
officer, Mr. Pappich, told me on 23 November that the Bureau has reason to:- .

believe that OSUALD's visit was to get Soviet support for a U.S. passport or
visa natter {perhaps the 1 new passport mentioned in the press articles). .
