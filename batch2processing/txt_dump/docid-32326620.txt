improve the facilities and believes that the public utilities
should be owned and operated by private investors, NY. T-1 stated
that the FRD and the MRP also came to the agreement that
properties illegally confiscated by the Castro Government

would be returned to their rightful owners and for properties
confiscated the Cuban Government would pay in bonds for twenty
