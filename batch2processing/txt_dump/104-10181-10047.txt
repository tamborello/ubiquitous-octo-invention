The method of authentication employe? in both eases involved songe
broadcast et a certain time over the Group of Soviet Forces,
Germany (GSO) radio freilities. The phraseology and contents -
indicated that the letter. had been prepered by the same agency and
possibly written by the seme pergon. The oimilerity to earlier
spproach letters, tentatively identiried ac having been written by
the Cormittee for State Seovr ity (xcs), suggests that the KGB was
also involved in these vperations.

“Fhe lead on. the civilion employee apperently was provided ty
USAREUR intelligence elector Vlad inir SLOBODA, who deserted in
August 1960 and sought reylum in the USSR. The initial telephone
call edvislng thet the letter had been delivered is elso believad
to have been made by SIOBDA. The dead on the warrant officer was
probably obtained by the SIS from Polish Intellivence which see~
ceeded in neutrelizing several sources handled by the varrant
