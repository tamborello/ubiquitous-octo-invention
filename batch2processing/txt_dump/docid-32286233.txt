business interests. PCI is anxious to obtain financial
backing ‘on a partnership ‘basis in this venture. In July,
1963, he read an article “in the magazine section of a. ( ’

. Miami, Fla., newspaper indicating that SAM GIANCANA, the e
well-known Chicago hoodlum, was seeking partnership arrange -
ments with American businessmen who. could obtain gambling 7
concessions in the Caribbean area and South America, which

\ Subsequently, PCI. contacted an acquaintance,
DAVIDYSAX, of Chicago, owner or former ‘owner of Saxony Hotel,
, Miami, Fla., and now a banker in Chicago, formerly a manufacturer
FeL,of punt boards. He told him of the article and asked
how GIANCANA could be approached. SAX told the PCI he
knew one of GIANCANA's close business associates and could
arrange a contact. J

Some time later, PCI received telephone call from
one DAVE (LNU) and TEDDY (LNU), who claimed to be GIANCANA's
business associates and desired a meeting to discuss the
matter.

.

 

. 4
PCI met DAVE and TEDDY in Miami, Fla., and they
seemed to know considerable about his financial standing,
the fact that his resources were committed and that the
brother of PCI was principal controller of their business
interests. U .

At first, DAVE and TEDDY wanted to know something
- of PCI's connections to assure, themselves he could get
gambling concessions in Puerto Rico and/or another Caribbean

area.) j

In the presence of DAVE and TEDDY, PCI called
L, 0. PENDLING, a Negro attorney and member of Parliament,
Nassau, Bahamas, with whom PC had had prior business
associations and made appointment to meet PENDLING in
Washington, D.C., in late August, 1963. PENDLING was unable
to keep the appointment since the March on Washington made
it impossible to get hotel reservations. |)

On or about 10-19-63 PCI met TEDDY and DAVE at
The Americana Hotel, New York City. At this meeting, DAVE
and TEDDY began talking about "protection" and ability of GIANCANA
Syndicate to furnish slot machines for gambling operation.
d With this turn in the negotiations, based on PCI's original
J understanding.that GIANCANA desired to invest money, he
: insisted on seeing GIANCANA. DAVE and TEDDY gave him no
encouragement along this line and told PCI it was not
necessary to contact them, but they would: contact him
always from a pay phone from wherever they were calling. ¥
