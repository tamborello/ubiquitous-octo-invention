1. The Washington Post, Septenber 6, 1962, carried an article
éatelined Miami, Florida, September 6, 1962; which io quoted as
follows: ne ; ;

“She Cuban Revolurticnary Council sald last night that

aras shipments being cent into Cuba by the Soviet Unien |

would be used to interfere with United States missile a

Jeunchings. Jose Miro Cardona, president of the Cuban 7

: exile group, said in a statement: "In different sections ;

: of Cuba, principally in the north coast of the province «Ge!

u of Pinay del Rio, missile rocket bases and electronic . 2:

equipment ave being installed for warlike operations. ‘ a

My, Cardona said the equipment would be used by the : g

f, Pidel Castro regime to ‘detect and interfere with the 5
fe: launchings from Cape Canaveral in Florida. '"

2 It would be appreciated if you would furnish any informatian
in your possession concerning the validity of the information appearing 4
in paragranh 1 of this memorandum. It would be helpful to know the \
‘type: of electronic equigment being installed in order to detexmine if \
such equipment is capable of interfering with launchings thro:gh intros
duction of false signals or nullification of intended signals.

3. Similiar requests have been directed to the Deparimentsof the
Amy ond Air Force, and the Central Intelligence Agency.
