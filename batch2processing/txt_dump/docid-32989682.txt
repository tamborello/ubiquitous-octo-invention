to Mosque #7, NYC. This represents a total of $14.00
from cach member. With approximately 500 people in
NOL contributing dues and psaper money each week, the
NYC Mosque is able to te¥e in approximately $72,000.00

taken up each Sunday, Wednesday and Friday mights, plus
the Savicrss Day collection for which each member is
expected to contribute $100.00. In addition, the
restuarants, bazaars and bakeries all contribute money
to the Mosque. Admittedly, a good portion of this money
eventually finds its way to ELIJAH MUHAMMAD im Chicago;

It is ‘also to be noted that FARRAKHAN, OWENS and

the NY area. When this publication is disseminated to
the membership,,it could caus? these above three
individuals to feel that the. literature was made up
by -. - other NOI leaders in the NY area who desire
to get rid of these three individuals and takeover the

NOI in NY for themselves. In other words, it is hoped

that the dissemination of this publication will result
in internal strife, distrust and disorder within the NOL
itself, .

place the above described counter-intelligence device

actual size of these publications is being left to the

To date, the NYO has been unable to make a
penetration into the top leadership of the NOI in NY,
as fer as informant development is concerned. Some
penetration of the top leadership might occur when
their economic security is jeopardized; when funds and
Salaries sre diminished and the NOI itself is threatened.
Efforts must be made to shake the confidence of the
membership in their leaders.

po The information that ample NOI funds are _
available to the leaders of the NOI must be made known
to individual NOI members.

‘In order to make this information known to
the members, the NYO Has prepared the following:

A large comic-book type publication made up
‘to ridicule, the leaders, This book depicts FARRAKHAN,
OWENS and GRAVITT, who is commonly known as Captain
JOSEPH, living the good life, having good homes, big
cars and wearing fine suits. It is felt that this type
‘publication would be an effective method of securing

Writial interest and would appesl: to a wide, a generally

uneducated audience. .

Shoe yar

‘The publication ‘would be mailed in ‘unmarked

- envelopes, purchased locally and would be sent to 36

‘members of the NOI who are on the Security Index of

. the NYO. It would also be mailed to a selective number

of 237 other individuals in the NYC area whose names
have appeared on membership records of the NOI. These
latter individuals reportedly joined the organization in
1963 and 196) and in all probability many of them are
still members or have close friends in the organization.

When the membership receives the publication,
it can reasonably be assumed that it will cause some of
them to start thinking and begin asking questions concerning
the leadership. They may become disenchanted in the
organization, cause others to be disillusioned and perhaps
future membership might also be reduced.
