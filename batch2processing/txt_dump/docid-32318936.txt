Re Bureau teletype dated 6/1/92.

 

Enclosed are copies two serials from Hong Kong file
190-0. The transfer of these serials is directly due to an
indices search at Headquarters of Hong Kong’s manual indices.

The manual indices search also indicated 89-00 and
62-49 contained information regarding the JFK assassination.
Upon review of files in Hong Kong, it was determined 89-00
contains only general information regarding assassinations,
nothing specifically relating the the JFK assassination. File
62-49 was destroyed in September, 1980, authority is not

 

known.
Hopefully, this information satisfies Bureau
request.
