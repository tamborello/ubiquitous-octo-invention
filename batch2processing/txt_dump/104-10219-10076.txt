MITCHELL, only once.. The meeting took place at Subject's
apartment in Source‘s former apartment complex. Source only
knows that MITCHELL is leading 4 normal life ns a mathematician.
Source described MITCHELL - in comparison with Subject - as a

Subject’s current lifestyle. Subject continuos to live a life
of imsorality and wastefulness on the 400 ruble a month dole

the methoda of exfiltration used by the Soviets to get Subject
froma Washington, D.C. to Moscow.

constantly by the K.G.B. and that the circle of reprobates
and profligates which has gathered around Subject is infiltrated
by a large number of K.G.B. informers. However, Source could

suspicion of being K.G.B. informers reporting on Subject.
Subject did inform Source that he had signed a document promiving
the Soviet Government that he will not travel more than 30 klas.
outside of Moscow. If Subject is ever found to have traveled
outside this limit, the document provides that he may be
indicted as a spy solely on that basis. -
