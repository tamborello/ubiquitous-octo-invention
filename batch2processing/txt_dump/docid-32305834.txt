it has been previously pointed out that, one of our
primary goals in the Criminal Inteiligence Program is the full
identification and subsequent prosecution of the membership of _
La Coga Nestra (LCN), the dominant group in organized crime 7:
in this country. With an ever~increasing public awareness of i
the significance of LCN on a national basis and in consideration sd
of the Bureau's vast responsibilities in the field ef organized
evime, it is necessary that complete intelligence he develeped
regarding LON.

 
 

A review of progress reported in the identification
of LCN members discloses that a substantial number have been |
identified. Your office has reported an increase in the number
of LCN members residing in your territory from 30 to 41 within
the past one-year peried. It is acted, however, that the
structure of the Detroit “family” has not been completely
developed. There currently existe a need for your office to
identify “caporegimas" and the membership assigned te each in
your division.

oy meubers, but as you know, he has been relatively inactive in LCN

we affairs in the recent past. Yo appropriately discharge your

provide accurate and authentic data regarding LCE. Their
importance cannot be overemphasized.

 

‘Your fop Echelon Criminal Informant Program must be
specifically aimed at a further penetration of LOW. Fo this end,
you should maintain an aggressive and continuous Pop Echelon
