° purchased 2,000 shares of Jubilee on April 27, 1965, at $2.75
per share, all of which were later sold at a price ranging from
$4.10 to $4.75. Led. FORGET & Co, Ltd. handled this purchase
for ROSELLI, after the latter had been vouched for by a George
PALLAY of 345 - 8th Avenue, New York City. PALLAY is known to 7%)
be a ‘close friend of John C. DOYLE, PALLAY is also known to
maintain a residence at the Friar's Club in Los Angeles,
however, as of June 10, 1965, he was known to be residing
at the Desert Inn in Las Vegas.

occasion he has had dealings with L.J. FORGET & Co. Ltd.
