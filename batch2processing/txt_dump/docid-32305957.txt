19893 Mrs. Myrtle McGourty, manager, Airport Motel, Bay Avenue, Port
“Newark, New Jersey, is reported to have told the interviewer that her

with Fr. tO.

that Riela told her he drove or went up to Apalachin with Zito,

In view of this it would be appreciated if we can be fur-
nished with any further information that may be available concerning 3
the interview or the fact that Riela and Zito went to Apalachin together.

An attempt is also be made jerfocate original registration
cards for Frank Zito and Ja olletti’ ‘at the Airport Motel during ad
November, 1957. If any stich documents are in the possession.of the
Bureau it would be appreciated if they could be forwarded to us.
