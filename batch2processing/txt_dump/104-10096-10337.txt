MEMORANDUM FOR: .. JHA: _ een

  

Shep phoned to say that James Wileott, Jie, a finance
clerk vith the Agency from 1957 (EOD.as GS-4), who served
“dn Tokyo 1960 to October 1964, has told HSCA people that
CTA hired Lee. Harvey Oswald when Oswald served im Atsusiy
Wilecott, after returning from Tokyo was assigned to JMIAVE
in 1965, and resigneyretired ip. 1966.

I noted that Oswald rebired from the Marine Corps in
September 1959. and went to the USSR in Oftobeb!:that ver,
returning tothhe US in June 1962, He was gone from Japan
by the time Shep told me Wilcott got there, / Anything tht
Wilcott thinks he knew had to be second handy. I said that
Russ Holmes inherited the so-called Oswald files, but that
he has assured me the Agency had no contact with Oswald. If] |.
there are contrary records they would have to be in EA file;

at WIC, and EA should be on it right away to identify what
is involved, When anything turns up to be checked, 0/Fin
Should then get at ip tight avays He is after ity
