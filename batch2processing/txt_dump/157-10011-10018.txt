Senator Tower. May I pursue that just a moment further?

You might say one thing in sworn testimony before a
committee like this, but say another thing publicly, is that
what you mean? .

Mr. Bissell. That is exactly what I mean.

fhe Chairman. Have you lied to this committee?

Mr. Bissell. No, sir. ;

The Chairman. Would you lie to this committee?

Mr. Bissell. No, sir.

.Senator Tower. I think that distinction/has tocbe made.
I think I would have lied about the uU-2 myself!

The Chairman. Shall we proceed with the questions?

Mr. Schwarz. The remaining topic I have is Trujillo.
It is respectfully indicated, and involves a lot of documents.
And we have some procedural matters that we need to take up.
I know we can't finish Trujillo before 12:30, and I would
suggest that. we ask the witness and whatever Sénators that
can return to. come back this afternoon on Trujillo.

The Chairman. We have a -Senate order that there will

be no further committee meetings this afternoon.

I doubt that we can obtain unanimous consent.

Mr.Bissell. In the case specifically of (Ehe°USKT, |
I would answer in the affirmative. I also believe, however,
that the Chief of the Intelligence Service of any one of those
countries would flatly deny that the chief of state had
knowledge of such action.
Senator Goldwater. Thank you.
Senator Baker. Would you deny it?
Mr. Bissell. In our case here?:

Senator Baker. Yes, sir.

 

Mr. Bissell. Yes, it would be appropriate to do so.
Senator Baker. Have you done so? . ’
Mr. Bissell. I have not had occasion to,| because I am
unaware of any high level assassination that occurred by
the U.S.
Senator Baker. Doesn't that amount to a denial?
Mr. Bissell. It is a denial that any has occurred,

at least in the period that I am aware of.

 

Mr. Schwarz. Was your answer to Senator Baker meant to

indicate that you would perjure yourself on this matter?

Mr. Bissell. It depends a little bit on ‘the context.
there are occasions when I would go a tong way {to protect the
President of the United States from certain kinds of embarrass-
ment. |

quoting a cable concerning the asset WIROGUE, who was sent
to the Congo in the fall of 1960.
The Chairman. Mr. Bissell, the memorandum to which
counsel has referred reads as follows:
"In recommending the agent or asset ROGUE), (the Chief ]

Station, Leopoldville, the Chief of the Agency's African

 

Division, probably Bronson Tweedy, wrote in late 1960:

‘He is indeed aware of the precepts of right and wrong,
but if he is given an assignment, which may. be morally wrong
in the eyes of the world,but necessary because his case offi-
cer ordered him to carry it out, then it is right, and he
will dutifully undertake appropriate action for, its execution
without pangs of conscience. In a word, he can rationalize
all actions'".

Is that fairly representative of the philosophy that
applied to such matters at the time?

Mr. Bissell. Well, it certainly applied within the

range of matters that would have come under SRRIFLE.

  

Could Tsay, Mr. Chairman, that I know of no way in

a i.
which it is possible to operate a secret intelligence agency
or a secret service unless it has at least a number of
employees who are willing to and can be depended upon to

carry out orders involving acts of this sort.

The Chairman. That assumes, of course, |that the

 

United States ought to assassinate foreign leaders.

Mr. Bissell. It was not meant to suggest that it was

entirely comparable, but the individual whom I have mentioned

were all perceived in their time and place as menaces to

their own countries and the U.S. interests.

Senator Goldwater. Might I ask a question based on his

experience?

From my readings in trying to learn more about intelli-

9 clearance?
10 Mr. Bissell. I can't answer you that, simply because
ll no specific target was ever recommended. And to the best
12 of my knowledge and belief, other than the case we have discussled

Mr. Schwarz. Why did you seek to assassinate Mr.
Lumumba?
Mr. Bissell. I didn't seek to assassinate him. I
told a member of the clandestine service to make plans and
develop the capability so to do if it were approved and
ordered.
Senator Goldwater. Approved by who?
Mr. Bissell. It would have then had to have approval
at the highest level of government.
The Chairman. Where did the idea come from?
Mr. Bissell. I don't remember, Mr. Chairman. It could
possibly have been mine.
The Chairman. It could possibly have been yours?

far? How many murders did you contemplate?
