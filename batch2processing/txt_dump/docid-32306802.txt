purpose of the meeting appeared to have something to do with
financial backing, at that time possibly buying land in the
area of the new Dallas-Fort Worth airport. .

It is also suggested that before interviewing MATRANGA,
Houston.check with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in Houston,
as the reporting Agent in reviewing files of that agency in
Dallas, noted its files make reference to a JOHN MATRANGA from
Houston in the 1930's who was strongly implicated in a narcotics
operation between Houston and Kansas City, Missouri. No identi-
fication of MATRANGA was available in the files here, mt it is
thought that if during the interview of JOHN F, MATRANGA sufficient
background data can be elicited from him it will assist Dallas in
determining whether the two are identical. It would also be
pertinent to determine from MATRANGA whether or not he is related os
by marriage or otherwise with CIVELLO and if not how their association ;
started and when. Bear in mind that any information by way of back-
ground obtained from MATRANGA will mt only be helpful to Dallas
but may assist Houston in its investigation of LCN there. Houston
should use caution in mentiming to MATRANGA that he was seen in
Dallas to protect informant, however, there is no objection to
asking him if he has ever visited CIVELLO in Dallas. Houston
note MATRANGA previously admitted acquaintance with the MACEO
brothers SAM and ROSE. ‘from Galveston, who were also known con-
tacts of CIVELLO prior to their deaths.

1959, to arrange for the lease of the property. Source stated

and was the one who gave CHARLES CIVELLO instructions: on

: ; Under date of 11/29/68, the San Diego Office furnished
the following information obtained from SD 1064-C-TE wherein on

11/19/68, informant mentioned and furnished information concern-
ing subject CIVELLO:

The following information came about as result of
meeting of the LCN Family on 11/9/68, at the home of San
Diego Capo JOE ADAMO,

At one point during the meeting NICK LICATA, LCN
Boss, Los Angeles, told the group that his consigliere, TOMMY
PALERMO, was not in attendance as he was on vacation in Texas,
visiting with his first cousin, LCN Boss JOE CIVELLO of Dallas.

At another point LICATA told the informant that his
consigliere, TOMMY PALERMO, had recently returned from Dallas,
Texas, where he had been in contact with his first cousin, LCN
Boss JOE CIVELLO. The informant advised that for many years
BENNIESAINE been a close friend of Las Vegas casino operator
BENNIEZBINION aka Cowboy, owner of the Horseshoe Club. BINION
has recently received @ couple of anonymous threatening tele-
phone calls demanding "money or else". Apparently BINION has
contacted CIVELLO for assistance. CIVELLO asked PALERMO to
contact his family and attempt to determine if the LCN is
behind this in any way in an attempt to shake him down, LICATA
told the informant that to his knowledge his Los Angeles LCN
family is not involved in this in any way. He wanted the
informant to contact FRATIANNO to determine if he is responsible
for it. Informant later was in personal contact with
FRATIANNO and FRATIANNO assured him he was not responsible
for these telephone calls. He reported this to LICATA,

In regard to CIVELLO,. the informant advised that he
has not seen him since about 1953. In the old days CIVELLO
frequently came to Southern California and would go to
Tijuana, B.C., Mexico, with the informant and others to eat -
quail in a favorite Tijuana restaurant. They also used this
occasion to conduct meetings with other visiting LCN bosses.
In those days, CIVELLO frequently went to Los Angeles. He
believed PALERMO is a first cousin and Frank Desimone was a
second or third cousin to CIVELLO. He believed also that in

' some way CIVELLO was related to JIMMY LANZA, LCN boss in San

Francisco although to his knowledge CIVELLO never went up to
San Francisco, but remained in the Southern California area
when visiting there. -
