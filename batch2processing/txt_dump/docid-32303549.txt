It had been intended that all details concerning
the attendees at MANNARINO's wake and funeral, plus
reorganization of activities in his sphere of control,
would be included in this report, which accounts for the
lapse of time in its preparation; but it has now been decided
to report all such information under the investigation of
his brother, GABRIEL MANNARINO, who handled all phases of the
funeral and whe should now accede to all of SAM MANNARINO's
areas of influence and control.
