CV 105-4509
ADMINISTRATIVE

Since there has been no indication that
subject has been in the Cleveland area and since CV 428-c
has ascertained that BAPST's relationship with DOMINICK
EDWARD BARTONE is reportedly.in connection with
importing sugar from Cuba, transshipped to the
United States through another island, no further inquiries
concerning subject will be made’ at this time at Cleveland
in order to avoid the-possibility of compromising cV 428-c.

It is noted that in the report of SA STAFFORD
dated December 30, 1960 at Miami, it was reported that
subject indicated he had gone to the Dominican Republic
to see an official on a "sugar deal".
