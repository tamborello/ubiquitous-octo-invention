é its origin in instructions issued by President Franklin D.
* Roosevelt as early as 1934.

On May 8, 1934, President Roosevelt ordered the FBI

to conduct an intelligence-type investigation to determine

whether there was a connection between the Nazi movement in

“the United States and German diplomatic and other official
representatives in this country. This investigation of the
Nazi movement ‘was conducted along the specified quidelines set
by the President and was not expanded to include ‘other groups
or movements.

However, on August -24 and August 25, 1936, President

ope: ., Roosevelt instructed former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to

information" concerning "subversive activities in the |
United States, particularly Fascism and Communism." .

_in response to President Roosevelt's request, FBI
Director Hoover issued instructions for the development of an
investigative program which would be responsive to the require-
ment imposed upon the Bureau by the President. The investigative
program undertaken by the FBI pursuant to these instructions
is being continued today in accordance with directives embodied

in’ Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 0.85, which
