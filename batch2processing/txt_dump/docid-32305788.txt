AT DALLAS, TEXAS _

A, EXISTENCE

7
There has been no change in the established existence
of the La Cosa Nostra "group" in Dallas, Texas, since last
reported. This is briefly restated as follows:

On March 31, 1959, DL T=-1 advised that during the 1920's
there had been an Italian organization in the Dallas, Texas area,
at that time under the control of CARLO T. PIRANIO. Following the
death of PIRANIO on February 20, 1930, his brother and business part-
ner JOSEPH T, PIRANIO continued as head of the organization until his
death by suicide on Ocrober 27, 1956. JOSEPH FRANCIS CIVELLO upon
the death of JOSEPH T, PIRANIO succeeded JOSEPH T, PIRANIO as head
man of the organization in Dallas, Texas. DL T=-l-on the above re
occasion described CIVELLO as the had man in Dallas and is the Dallas i
representative of the nationwide Italian criminal organization.

 

 

As to the makeup of the Italian organization in Dallas, as
described by DL T-1 above, DL T-3, reported the following on May 31,
1966, which information is alleged to have been furnished to DL T-3
directly by a very close associate of CIVELLO who indicated that he
had obtained the information directly from CIVELLO. DL T=-3 had
obtained the information from his source on May 28, 1966. This. infor-
mation is summarized as follows:

During the 1920's a "group" of Italians in Dallas, Texas,
had has their "boss" CARLOW PIRANIO and the “under boss" was CARLO'S
brother, JOSEPH PIRANIO. JOSEPH PIRANIO took over as "boss" upon. the
death of his brother in 1930. Members of that group in addition
to the PIRANIO brothers were JOSEPH CIVELLO, ROSS MUSSO, FRANK IANNI, .
RALPH PATRONO, PHILIP CIVELLO, CARLOS CAMPISI, PETER DUCA (PETER MICHAEL
DUCA), and ROSS INTERRANTE, This group engaged in some narcotics,
gambling and fencing, but never on a large scale as all of the rackets
in Dallas were then controlled by non-Italian hoodlums. Through the
PIRANIO brothers the group had connections with an Italian group in the
Houston ~ Galveston, Texas areas, but the PIPANIO brothers were the
bosses for both groups.. CIVELLO had bragged that under the PIRANIO .
brothers that at that time the group was small, but well ‘organized, and
through the PIRANIOs the group also had connections "up East" and
CIVELLO had identified one of these contacts as ROCCO PELLEGRINO (of
White Plains, New York, identified member of the La Cosa Nostra).
