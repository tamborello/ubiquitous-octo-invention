--Q, «Start again, tell me what happened? A. Mark took off his
-,Clothes.” At: first Phyllis, I think the first thing she did, she
put one. candle with a big end in his rectum -and then another |
.candle with-a smell end in. his rectum with vaseline and pushed |
-them ali the. way up so that about a foot of candle was in his |
-rectum. Then she plucked hair from his testicles with tweezers, .
-'and she put a cocktail stirrer in the hole of his penis and then
‘put alcohol on the cocktail stirrer and: put it in his penis and
-'then-put alcohol on his penis. And she gave him ar enema and my

 

him Hold the enema in him while he masturbated. He couldn't
-hold it any longer and had tc go and relieve himself. We beat
“him with a belt that raised welts on his buttocks, .We took
ihumiliating pictures of him. We-hig one of. the pictures that had
vhis' face in it.so-we would have it as evidence for something if -!}
“we ever needed it. And we repeated the same bit with the candle,
with the: enema, with the cocktail stirrer, with the tweezers and
with hit needles. We'got then hot over a cigarette lighter and.
poking them in his testicles and his rectum and beating him yith
the belt. And he wanted us to do it more and more. He didn t
want to stop. Pretty soon it got late and Phyllis had to feed “her
daughter and she left the room and I started doing these things,
:. beating him, with the cocktail.stirrer, with the alcohol, and
-then. instead of masturbating he wanted me to masturbate him.
Phyllis and I wanted him out of there, wanted to get him home, so
‘I thought maybe if he came he would go home. I tried and the nex

 

“|. to make love to me. He got my clothes half off of me. I was jus

“T trying nicely to push him away and he had most. of my clothes off
| .mé. Finally I said to hell with it, I'll take them off. . And :
Phyllis like came to the door and he told me to tell her not to

- come. in for a while. So I told her not. to- come in for a while.
He made love to me, .

G Now, tell. us what tests, so-called: ‘tests were! ‘conducted in ce
your apartsent-on January 18th, 1962 in complete detail,and just.
what you did and what Lee did and uhat Mark did?. A Thesfirst-- ~
thing was Mr. Lane had his temperature taken. First he. ‘undressed
rimself as far as the shorts were concerned. and then ‘he laid’ face AG
.dovm on the bed and I.said, "You- have to. remove your jockey shorts).
-too,” and he slid them of2 down and in that I assisted him. _ After
that I inserted a candle into’ Mark anaily. . after that I. tweezed
some pubic hair. And then Lee then beat Mark with his own belt:
on the buttocks. Then pins were inserted around the anal. xxmq
area and into the testicles. Then he got an enema. Both of us ~
gave him the enema. I believe held the bag and I.'put it: in and
then he started to masterbate afte? the enema was completely in|.
nim and he wasn't supposed to relieve himself until after he .—
uzszx maesterbated, but he claimed that’ he had to relieve. himself,
so he did, and then when Mark cee back into the room the next:

go it later. So then Lee chen inserted a ‘candle into his ‘anus an

obscene pictures. Before the pictures, the first set of pins -- |
; xucc or needles, whatever you want to- call then, ‘were just regular

according to the instruction sheet. “Mark: was,also supposed to — |
have inserted into himself red hot needles, So Lee dit ‘the: needles
end I put them in and we both did it.. a ' ;

     
  
 

Q When you say you inserted. the: needles. “where “aid you. “insert”

| these needles? & The same place as before; the tésticles and
around the angl opening. Then ut that point; to. the’ ‘best ofemy
knowledge, I believe was when the next instruction was to be for ae
