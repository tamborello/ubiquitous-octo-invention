subscribers to the publication "Fair Play" was included in |
this material. g#Ae voluminous mailing list was included in
this material but there was no way to determine whether a
code system is being used on this list in order to designate
members orf subscribers.

  
 
   
 

Among the material furnished by the informant’ | was . :
a list of names entitled, "NYC, FPCC Committee Members: Monthly: ||
Pledges." This was a list of Approximately 50 to 60 names :
and most of them had a committee designation next to the name, -
such as Membership Committee, and so forth. a

The informant also furnished a list of names of members MW:
of student groups. This was a list of approximately 80 names & a
and appears to be the name of the head of the student group I
at different colleges throughout the country.

Curl) X NY 3164 _Shavisea SA JAMES M, KENNY om 6/5/61, that x -

he heard NLEY FAULKNER, FPCC attorney, say that, They would
never turn the membership list over to the SISS,’

THOMAS M, TREACY - PSI advised SA ROBERT C. BURNS on | $3}
5/5/61, that & a meeting of FPCC on 4/27/61, RICHARD GIBSON, | | :
Chairman of the Meeting, suggested a vote be taken on a motion
to permit other organizations to join FPCC. Discussion arose u ;
concerning who should vote and it was decided that only members TB |
should vote. Apparently the method to be used to determine who :
was a member was that everyone voting was to show his membership |
ecard. After some discussion on this procedure, the entire matter |
was referred to the FPCC Executive Committee to report on membership 4
at the next meeting.

‘

(Ey 1286- sMfoovises on 5/3/61, that STANLEY FAULKNER , i
informed ISADORE GIBBY NEEDLEMAN (Attorney for Amtorg Trading
Corporation in many matters) that a hearing for FPCC had been , 2

FPCC was supposed to have produced certain records. He mentioned
that the Committee wanted a membership list but would not get. a 4
it as there was none { ;

CG 6464~S* advised that at a meeting of the Executive
Committee, FPCC, Chicago Chapter, held on 5/20/61,RICHARD.
GIBSON was in attendance. He stated that the organization: wantedl
to protect anyone who is a member or a sympathizer with FPCC, He
stated that the National Office destroyed all its membership . 4
lists ‘in January, 1961, and the only list in the whole world = Ae
concerning membership in the FPCC as of January, 1961, #s- ‘in the
personal possession of ROBERT TABER, who is now in Havana,’ :
Cuba. He said that insofar as his area was concerned, membership wh
cards were the cue to membership and that such a card is a
requirement for voting privileges at FPCC meetings. . Lotte

Koc 6259-8 advised SA RAYMOND E, MOOMEY, on 5 /23/eg RUA) 7
that at this same Chicago meeting on 5/20/61, GIBSON mentioned j
that the National Conference of FPCC will be held almost certainly i
in NYC. One vote will be allotted to every 100 persons in the po
areas covered by the chapters and either one vote or 4 vote will f :
ia
t
U

 

 

be allotted to each student chapter. Any FPCC member (as decided
by presentation of membership cards) may attend any of the \
sessions but only authorized delegates may vote. The Henry i
Hudson Hotel was considered to be a likely site for the sessions.
GIBSON pointed out there would probably be more names on each © i
area's mailing list at the National Office than there are members ‘
but that this cannot be helped. ;
Inasmuch as the above information does not specifically i.
contradict the testimony given by GIBSON, no attempt at determining ,
willingness of the sources to testify to this information is ‘A
being made. . ; ;
