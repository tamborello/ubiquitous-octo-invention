CHAIRMAN STOKES APPEARS TO HAVE ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE
PROPOSAL FOR OBTAINING ANSWERS FROM MEXICO AGENT TO WRITTEN
was
UAee ANOTHER MEXICO AGENT ABOUT WHOM HEADQUARTERS{NOT

veboaes IS TO BE ADDED TO THE ACTIVITY.

CONSIDERATION NOW FOCUSSING ON HOW TO DO IT. TWO ALTER-
NATIVE PROPOSALS NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION. ONE WOULD INVOLVE
RECENT MILITARY ADDITION TO IG STAFF. OTHER INVOLVES USE OF
IOB STAFFER BURT WIDES (IF IOB WOULD AGREE).

NOTHING FIRM YET, BUT DIRECTION SEEMS TO ACCEPT OUR
OBJECTIONS TO DIRECT ACCESS BY HSCA PEOPLE TO OUR AGENT. I0B
COURSE WOULD INVOLVE ACCESS BY NON-AGENCY PERSON TO OUR AGENT,

 

ALTHOUGH HE COULD BE PRESENTED TO AGENT AS AGENCY PERSON.

OBVIOUSLY PROBLEMS REMAIN, BUT PROGRESS SEEMS RIGHT
DIRECTION.
