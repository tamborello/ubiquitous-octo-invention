PARSONS related that MILLER told him there was a Denver
and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RG) train derailed in the area
of the east portal of the Moffat Tunnel near Tolland, Colorado,
by MM members to show their ability to create havoc and sabotage
to transportation facilities.

(Our sources at D&RG have reported that they have
received no information that the cause of the derailment of a
freight train near the east portal of the Moffat Tunnel was
caused by any planned sabotage.) ;

PARSONS also told this source that HARRIS MILLER told
PARSONS not to contact MILLER again until "the heat was of£"
md to"lay low until CIA pressure was off.'' PARSONS also advised
source that MILLER said PARSONS should check around quietly
and without suspicion to find out if any members or potential
members had been questioned by the FBI or CIA Agents.

On March 14, 1965, PARSONS told source that he had
arranged for DAVID LUDVIGSEN, an employee of the PSC, to meet
with HARRIS MILLER and two of MILLER's associates. LUDVIGSEN
later told PARSONS that he did not join MM due to the fact the
group demanded "blind faith in their group" and that he, LUDVIGSEN,
might have to assassinate commmists in the Government.

DAVID MARENTI LUDVIGSEN, 1180 Yosemite, Aurora, Colorado,
advised on March 15, 1965, that he worked for the PSC in the
Appliance Section. He stated that he had known DAVID EUGENE
PARSONS approximately three or four years. He stated that both
he and PARSONS, prior to the November, 1964, elections, worked
on behalf of the candidacy of Senator BARRY GOLDWATER, He stated
that PARSONS and he apparently had the same political beliefs
and considered themselves conservatives. ,

MILLER told PARSONS that Mr. LEARNED was a CIA Agent
who Lived at "681" Oneida Street, Denver, and then gave PARSONS
a description of Mr. LEARNED, MILLER told PARSONS to drive by
Mr. LEARNED's home and observe and pick up information about him.
PARSONS indicated to this source that he liked and enjoyed this —
assignment and that he had planned to drive by LEARNED's residence.

(Special Agent JOSEPH C, LEARNED, Denver FBI Office,
interviewed HARRIS BENJAMIN MILLER on April 23, 1964, in connec-
tion with investigation of the MM organization, at which time
MILLER would neither deny nor affirm his activities in, connection
with the MM organization. It is to be noted that SA LEARNED's
residence is listed in the Denver telephone directory as 636
Oneida Street, Denver, Colorado. SA LEARNED has not contacted
MILLER since April 23, 1964.)

PARSONS related to the source that MILLER told hin’
the CIA director in Denver, who was killed in an automobile
collision on March 12, 1965, was probably killed by MM agents
to prove to the Federal Government and citizens who were communist
followers that they (MM) were a powerful and secret group with
the means to strike out at anyone, anywhere, and at any time.

(The local press in Denver on March 12 and 13, 1965,
reported the death of General H. LYNN OSTLER in an automobile
accident which happened near Eagle, Colorado, on the morning of
March 12, 1965. The press identified General OSTLER as the
Regional Director of CIA.’ Through our sources connected with
CIA, it was known on March 12, 1965, that General OSTLER's death
was caused by a head-on collision of OSTLER's automobile with a
truck which happened at approximately 7:00 A.M. on a main mountain
highway located near Eagle, Colorado.)
