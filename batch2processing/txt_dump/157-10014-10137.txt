The Following testimony regarding the relationship
between "the White douse” and the executive action capability
was obtained by the Committee:

Harvey: Harvey testified that his missing notes indica:
ted that Bissell mentioned White House urgings to develop an execu-
tive action capability (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 37). Harvey said that
he "particularly remember [ed]" that Bissell said that he received
“more than one" urging from the White House (llarvey, 6/25/75,
pp. 36-37; 2/21/75, p.-59).. However, he had no direct evidence
that Bissell actually had any such discussion with "the White House."
No specific individual in the White House was named to Harvey
(arvey, 6/25/75, p. 31). Moreover, ‘he said that it would have been

Bissell did not recall "a specific conversation with anybody in
‘the White House. as the origin” of his instruction to, Harvey (Bissell,
6/9/75, p. 51).

During the course of several appearances before the
Committee, Bissell's testimony varied as to whether or not he had
been urged by the White House to develop an ‘executive action

capability.

In his initial appearances: before the Committee on June 9 and
11, 1975, Bissell made statements that tended to indicate that White
House authorization had been given. In response to the "twice urged"

: quotation of Harvey's notes in the Inspector General’s Report,
Bissell said, "I have no reason to believe that Harvey ‘s quote is
wrong." (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 51). Bissell accordingly said in his .
initial testimony that as far as he knew, it was true that he was
asked by the White House to create a general stand-by. assassination
capability. (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 49).

Based again upon Ilarvey's missing notes ("White House urging")
and his initial statement that he ‘had no reason to challenge their:
accuracy, Bissell initially gave the opinion that HeGeorge Bundy
(Id., 6/9/75, p. 49), Special Assistant to President Kennedy , for

National Security Affairs, and walt Rostow (Id. P- 51), Deputy

 

“Assistant to President. Kennedy during 1961, were the two people from
- whom such a request was most likely to have’ come (Id., 53), because
“ they were. "the .two members of the White ‘House staff who were closest
to CIA operations." -(Id., p. 54):
At another point in his initial testimony, Bissell. said ‘that
the creation of the capability "may have been initiated within the.
Agency" (Id., p. 81). And still later he said: “there is lictle ,;
doubt in my mind that Project RIFLE was discussed with Rostow and
possibly Bundy" ‘(Bis ssell, 6/11/75, Pp. 46).
When Bisse ul returned to the, Committee on july 17 and 22, his

testimony, given in light of information gained since his earlier

 

HW. 50955 Docld: 32423525 Page 10
Harvey testified that the “executive action" capability
was intended to include assassinations (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 35).
His cryptic handwritten. notes of the January 25/26 meetings; pre-’

served at the CIA, contain phrases which suggest:a discussion of

assassination--and Harvey confirmed this interpretation: “last
resort beyond last resort and a confession of weakness", "the
magic an and "never mention.word assassination". (Harvey,
Ex. 1,-6/25/75) :* .

The Inspector General's Report did not mention these
notes, or their ‘dates. ‘However, in describing Richard Bissell's
initial assignment of the “executive action" project to Harvey, °.
it referred to another set of- Harvey’ s notes, which were destroyed
after the preparation of the Report. The excerpt from these notes

quoted Bissell as saying: to Harvey, "The White House had twice

wo urged me to create such a capability" (1.G:, P. 37). Harvey also

. testified that this "urging" was mentioned in his initial dis-

: cussion of "executive action” with Bissell (Harvey, 6/25/75, ‘p. 37).
However, the- testimony’ from Bissell and White House aides ‘in the
“Kennedy and Eisenhower Administrations ‘is in conflict with Harvey!s.
testimony as ‘to whether such “urging” had in fact been given .to

Bissell.

* Harvey's notes also contained a-phrase which suggests his con-
cern that any U.S. assassination attempts might breed retaliation
from other governments: “dangers of RIS (Russian Intelligence
Service) counter-action and monitor if they are blamed." (Harvey,

might have transpired in “early January" (Harvey, 6/25/75, p.

about the timing of their initial discussion (Bissell, T7175,

p. 10).

nation with Arnold Silver, and this discussion, at the ‘very
least, had to take place after I know Bissell already had
discussed the matter with Silver. (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 52).

Harvey had also testified that, after receiving Bissell's initial in-
‘structions to establish an executive action capability:

the first thing I did’. .°. was discuss in theoretical
terms with a few officers whom I trusted quite implicitly
the whole subject. of assassination, ‘our possible assets;

and properly, securely and discreetly, -(Harvey, 6/25/75, —

pp. 37-A, 38). . os

“|: The Inspector General's Report connected Silver and Gottlieb ‘to the
“early stages of the executive action project as follows:

Harvey says that’ Bissell had already discussed certain
aspects of the problem with Arnold Silver and with Sidney
Gottlieb. Since Silver was already cut in, Harvey -used
him in developing the Executive Action Capability....
Harvey's mention of him [Gottlieb] in this connection

may explain a notation by Dr. Gunn that Harvey instructed
Gunn to discuss techniques with Gottlieb without associa-
ting the discussion with the Castro operation. (1.G.
Report, “pp. 37-38).

It is evident from the testimony of Harvey and Bissell that the turn-
= ‘over to Harvey of the Roselli contact in November 1961 was discussed
‘aS part of ZRRIFLE (see Section (d), infra). Thus, their initial
‘discussion of- executive action can, at the least, “be dated before
November 1961 and the "25/1" and "26/1" notations would have to. .
refer to January 1961.

by assassination capability; more specifically, it involved —
“spotting” potential agents and “researching” assassination:
techniques that might be used (Bissell, 7/17/75, p. 11 and 6/9/75,
p. 73; Harvey, 6/25/75, pp. 37-A, 45). Bissell characterized
Project ZR/RIFLE as "internal and purely preparatory" (Bissell,
7/22/75, p. 32). The 1.G. Report’: of 1967 found “no indication

in the file that the Executive Action Capability of ZR/RIFLE-
QJ/WIN was ever used", but said that “after Harvey took over the
Castro operation, he ran it as one aspect of ZR/RIFLE". (1.G.
pp. 40-41.)*

(b) The Question of White House Initiation, Authorization,
or Knowledge of the Executive Action Project

.There is general agreement on one fact: at some point in
early 1961 Bissell discussed the executive action capability with.

the evidence varied widely. , | 7
Harvey testified that Bissell had told him that "the
-White House" ‘had twice urged the creation of such a capability
and ‘the Inspector - General's Report quoted notes of Harvey's (mo
longer in existence) to that effect. Bissell did not recall. any

specific conversation with the White House" ‘However, his initial

" testimony assumed the correctness of Harvey's notes: ». and stated

that, while he could have created the capability on his own, any
-urgings would have come from Bundy or Walt Rostow. In a later
appearance, however, Bissell said he merely informed Bundy of
the capability -and that the context was a briefing by hin and
not .urging by Bundy. Bundy said he received a briefing and,
gave no urging, though he raised no objections. Rostow said-he
never heard of the project.

William Harvey testified that he was "almost certain"
that on January 25 and 26, 1961, he met. with CIA officials Sidney
“Gottlieb. the new Chief of CIA's Technical Services Division, and
Arnold Silver, a CIA recruiting officer, to discuss the feasibility
of creating a capability within the Agency for "executive action"

meetings ,* Harvey testified that they took place after his: initial,

tations "25/1-Sid G" and "26/1-AS" indicate that he spoke to Sidney

‘fied as follows: .

Q: “And is’ it ‘your judgment that’ that is January 26, 1961 and

Harvey: Yes, it is.

Harvey: .... [WJell, when I first looked at this, 1 thought

now that it is not. If this is true, this might place the.-
first discussion that I. had with Dick Bissell in early

‘ January and this is difficult to pinpoint because there were
several such discussions in varying degrees of detail during
the period in the spring, and very early in '6l to the fall
of '61 period, but I did find out fairly early on that Silver

The “Executive Action" Capability

 

Along with the question of authorization for actual assas-~-

sination attempts, the Committee considéred the extent and nature

of authorization for a CIA project which included, as one element,

the development of an assassination capability.
(a) Introduction 7
Sometime in early 1961, Richard Bissell (Deputy Director
of Plans) instructed William Harvey, who was at that time the
Chief of one of CIA's Foreign Intelligence staffs, to establish
an “executive action capability" which included research into a
capability to assassinate foreign leaders. (Bissell 6/9/75, p. 51;
Harvey, 6/25/75, pp. 36-37.) At some time within the same period,
Bissell and McGeorge Bundy (Special Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs) had a conversation about the matter.
Bissell, Harvey and Helms all.agreed that the “generalized”

capability was never used" (Bissell 6/9/75, p. 87; Harvey 6/25/75,

7p. 45; Helms 6/13/75, p. 52).

"Executive action" is a CIA, euphemism, défined © by the

"testimony before the Committee as a project for esearch into.

developing means. for ‘overthrowing foreign political leaders, ineclud-

ing a “capability to perform assassinations". (Harvey 6/25/75,

p. 34.) Bissell indicated that executive action covered a “wide

spectrum of actions" to "eliminate the effectiveness" of foreign

leaders, with assassination as the "most extreme" action on the

spectrum (Bissell, 7/22/75; p. 32). The Inspector General's Report

described executive action as a “general stand-by capability” to
carry out. assassination when required (1.G., p. 37). The project
was given the code name ‘ZR/RIFLE by the CIA.*

A single agent Casset"), given the cryptonym QS/WIN,

was placed under Harvey's supervision for the ZR/RIFLE project,

‘but never used in connection with any actual assassination efforts.

Richard: Helms described. QJ/WIN's “capability':

"If you needed somebody to carry out murder, I guess you
had a man who might be prepared to carry it out." (Helms,
6/13/75, ps 53). ae ;

Harvey did use agent QJ/WIN, however , to spot "individuals

-with criminal and underworld connections in Europe -for possible

"multi-purpose use" (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 50). For example, QJ/WIN-

reported that a potential asset. in the Middle East was "the leader

of a gambling syndicate" with "an available: pool of assassins"

However, Harvey testified that:
"during the entire existence of the ‘entire ZRRIFLE project
no agent was recruited for the purpose of assassina-
tion, and no even tentative targeting or target list was
ever drawn." (Harvey, 6/25/75, p.. 45.) ° :
Project ZR/RIFLE involved,’ generally, assessing the
problems and requirements of assassination and developing a-stand:+

:

 

* ZR/RIFLE was a cryptonym relating to two programs. One was
the executive action assassination capability. The other was
another program which is not part of the subject matter of this
report: (William Harvey had been in charge of the CIA section
with general responsibility-for such programs.) This second
program was genuine, but it was also to provide a..cover. for any
executive action operation. (Harvey, 6/25/75, p.. 49.) .
