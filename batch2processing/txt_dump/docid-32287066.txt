of knowing whether MARCI wished to have him have RIORDAN

present at this luncheon but was told by MARCI that he

wished to discuss the situation with REYNOLDS before talking

to RIORDAN. It appeared to the source that REYNOLDS has '
already, or will by the time of the luncheon, have talked with

RIORDAN and determined what his orders are in regard to the

strip joints in the Loop. From the information he furnishes

MARCI, MARCI will then determine what tack to take with

RIORDAN at such time as they meet. 4

Later in the day MARCI was joined by one SAM (LNU),
a Democratic Precinct Captain within the 28th Ward, who met
with MARCI to discuss the possibility of his being nominated ‘
as the potential Alderman for this Ward. It is pointed out
that the former Alderman of this Ward was one ANTHONY GIROLAMI, ‘
presently the Clerk of the Probate Court who is identical .
with CG 6498-PC, Their conversation was as follows:

to the post of First District Commander. REYNOLDS was desirous

MARCI: I know there's a lot of guys shootin' for it.
I haven't heard anything about it. If I tell you
not to go for it, I might be hurting your
chances. There's a possibility.

SAM: Who can I talk to? I can talk to you, I can
talk to JOHN, but there's nobody else.

MARCI: I don't know if they've got anybody in mind or
not. It wasn't discussed yet. Maybe they were '
waiting to see if TONY (GIROLAMI) was elected.
Now they'll get busy. I don't know if they'll
. take a guy that belongs to the organization or
one that doesn't belong to the organization. ‘
As soon as I know that they are considering
guys I'11 let you know about it. Unless you go
to TONY and tell him that you'd like to be
considered. I think you should.

 

in SAM: I'd be very happy to do that.

MARCI: That's where I'd start. Then if he gets to say
who it is you got a chance. If he told who
it will be that's something else. But up to
my knowledge I know it isn't gone yet. I
don't even know who's in front. There's so 4
many guys going I don't know who the front

runners are.

CG 92-350

In reference to the above it is noted that CG 6498-PC
has advised mncerning several contacts which have been made
with him during the past year or so by Chicago top hoodlunms,

SAM GIANCANA and MURRAY HUMPHREYS. This PCI, who is the

leading political power in his Ward, advised SA WILLIAM F.
ROEMER last week that considerable pressure has been put on

him to lend his influence, which is tantamount to the Democratic
nomination and therefore to election, to certain individuals

in their campaign to become Aldermen of the 28th Ward, a

Ward located on the west side of Chicago in a predominantly
Italian section. The PCI has advised that GIANCANA is
interested in the nomination of BOBBY PETRONE, mentioned

above by MARCI. The PCI also advised that several lesser
hoodlums, probably including JOE GAGLIANO, have approached

him concerning the candidacy of JOE GARAMBRONE, mentioned

above by MARCI, It is noted that GARAMBRONE is presently the
PCI’s secretary in his Ward organization and is also the ,
brother of MOUSEY GARAMBRONE, who is a chief lieutenant of the “
GUS ALEX - LOUIE BRIATTA gambling organization in the First

Ward of Chicago. However, last week the PCI advised that

he has not yet announced it and is keeping it quiet but has

decided to lend his support to AL TOMASO. TOMASO was formerly

the head of the Chicago Office of the Illinois Secretary of

State, is a former school teacher in Chicago, is a graduate .
of DePaul Law School, is a former student for the priesthood f
who now has a son studying for the priesthood, and to the ‘
knowledge of the PCI has never been tainted by association 4
: with hoodlums or by an arrest. PCI stated that he is very

Hyk sincerely trying to find the best man in his Ward organization
F contrary to the desires of the hoodlum and gambling interests
there.
