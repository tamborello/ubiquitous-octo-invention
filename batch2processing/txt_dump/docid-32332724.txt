General Information of ‘a Criminal Nature Relating tothe

overage.

 

PG T-1 has advised that there is a definite possibility that -
the PRUNER--brothers, officials at LA ROCCA's North Star
Cement Block Company in Pittsburgh, have transferred stock
in AT &T to LA ROCCA and that neither LA ROCCA nor the PRUNERS
have listed this stock on their income tax returns. He further-
explained that although LA ROCCA has sold stock in the North
Star. Cement. Block.Company, he is holding this stock as security

- for his employees until they can come up with a set sum. The
informant stated that.he does not. think that either LA ROGCA or
his employees have. paid tax on this stock and that the PRUNER
brothers. have threatened to "talk" -if the stocks are not returned
to. them so they can be transferred and LA ROCCA given his money.
The informant estimated that ROY VEY, another company executive,
and the PRUNER brothers owe roughly $40,000 to LA ROCCA personally
or $80,000 to the corporation, and that if either of these amounts
is paid, the stock will be returned to them. :

GEORGE ARMSTRONG, Vice-President, Stock Issue Corporation, AT & T,
50 Varick Street, New York City, advised on April 25, 1961, that
a thorough review of all his records fails to indicate that.

' ALDO and ALMO PRUNER hold any stock in AT & T nor have they
held any stock at any time in the past.

On May 3, 1961, ARMSTRONG advised that JOHN S. LA ROCCA and
MARY. LA ROCCA, 900 West Ingomar Road, Pittsburgh, Pa., opened an
account with AT & T on April 21, 1961, with a purchase of 39
shares of AT & T stock on that date. The stock records note
them as. joint tenants with right of -survivorship. mo
