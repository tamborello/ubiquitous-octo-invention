18. The "Unidentified individual" remains to this day
unidentified. There is still no credible evidence, as far as

CIA is aware, that the individual in the photograph had any

connection with Lee Harvey OSWALD or the assassination of

President Kennedy.

11. one ‘additional element of background must be
stipulated now as the final precondition to understanding the
relevance (or irrelevance) of the photo of the unknown
individual placed in the. chain of evidence on 23 November in
Dallas by the FBI agent: what was the. totality of CIA Mexico! s
coverage of OSWALD's activity as of the afternoon of the 23rd
when all: available coverage had been checked? -

12. The totality of Mexico Station coverage on or reasonably
inferable to be OSWALD: consisted of five (5) voice intercepts.

_ Each of these items,. including the text of the raw intercepts, _

_ were read by, discussed with, and examined by Warren Commission
staffers -in ‘Headquarters and at the Mexico Station during a stay
from 8-13 April 1964. ~All were made available promptly to. :

. 13. At about mid-day on 1 October, the camera registered

the entry into an Embassy of a white- shirted individual. In the
opinion of the Station, among_ all the persons photographed that
day, he appeared to be the only non-Latin and possibly American

‘who entered. On the. chance that there could be an association -

between the identification data derived. from the voice inter-
cept and the descriptive data derived from the photograph, the
Station reported the two elements as separate. facts in its cable
to Headquarters on 8 October. oe

14. ‘The: Station' s action was not unusual and really amounted
to an analytic “quantum leap," in terms of the primitive ‘status
of the OSWALD identification. Many examples of a similar kind “of

thing can be found in the day-to-day record of Station-Headquarters

: 15. On 22 ‘November 1963 the Mexico Station “cabled Head-
quarters at 2229Z time after learning of the arrest of: Lee H.
OSWALD, age 24, possibly in connection. with ‘the. assassination,
and referenced its earlier messages of 8-9 and 15 October and |
Headquarters” reply of 10 October. The Station requested by:

, “priority. pouch a photo of OSWALD so that Station
can check all recent coverage for. OSWALD. "-Forward-
ing soonest copies of only visitor on 1 October who
could be identical with OSWALD." .

16. This obviously was for comparison at the Station

which had estimated the age. of the unidentified male whose
: photograph it had selected. as having the "apparent age of 35."
17. .The Station meanwhile had begun an exhaustive and —-
accelerated review of all its technical and photographic intel- -—
‘ ligence. A dispatch was prepared in accordance. with the So
. indication given in the cable of 22 November. The “dispatch |
noted that photo coverage of the unidentified individual had
turned up on 4 and 15 October. “The text of the 22 November 1963
pouched dispatch read: i

“L. Attached are copies of. the only snctoginte”*

obtained. . .on i October 1963 which appeared to be

an American. This same man visited {ari Embassy on.

compounding this erroneous conclusion was the fact that, when
- she had been shown a copy. of the same photograph in her appearance
before the Commission, ‘it had been’ cropped by the FBI in Washing- —
“ton in a. slightly different manner. - , .
‘4, Although in no way related to Lee Harvey OSWALD or his
stay in Mexico City from the morning: of 27. September 1963 to the —
, morning of 2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the ~
unidentified man originated during OSWALD's stay there. ‘Itv is
_- important, therefore, to an understanding of the acquisition and
handling of the photographs by the Mexico Station to review what.
| the Station ascertained and did with the information it developed
about OSWALD in Mexico city, together with Headquarters action ‘on 7
that information. , ,
5. From all credible evidence known to this time (mone,
“incidentally, added since the exhaustive work of the Warren Com-
mission), Lee Harvey OSWALD spent four (4) full days’ and ‘two. (2)
partial days" -- about 116 hours in all -- in Mexico City from about
10:00 a.m. 27 September. 1963 to about 8:30 a. m. 2 October 1963.
‘His place of residence was a small commercial traveler hotel, not oor
‘frequented by "gringos” -- the Hotel Commercio -- where he was: -
registered under alias. Exhaustive and detailed interviews and
interrogation by the Mexican authorities and the FBI after. the
assassination established that, in the recollection of all hotel
personnel, he left and returned late each day of his stay.
6. Allowing for the fact of late arrival and early departure,
and assuming that he slept one-third of the time of his stay

(38 or 39 hours), there remain some 78 hours of activity to be

accounted for. Overall, CIA's information can account only for
very brief periods during 28, 29 September and 1 October. All
coverage by CIA during the entire period was technical. The
Station had no live ‘source (living agent) coverage.

7. It should be noted that OSWALD was in no sense “under
investigation." None of the facts of his defection and stay in
the USSR and return to the U. S., 1959 -- 1962, were known to the
Mexico. Station or in its files before 10 October 1963. On that
date, the bare bones of his biography were forwarded by Head-
quarters in response to a Station cabled report of 8 October
which had forwarded,-on a routine basis, what appeared to be a
contact by an American for a visa to Cuba in transit to the USSR.
‘This was indicated and deduced from technically acquired infor-
mation on 1 October, which was the first and only occasion on that |
visit in which OSWALD was recorded as identifying himself —
(partially) by true name. .

8. At no time during his stay in Mexico City did the CIA
acquire a photo of OSWALD. A careful review of all coverage ---
technical as well.as photographic -- was conducted by the Station
on 22 and 23 November 1963 after the assassination, including
materials back to August 1963. This confirmed that there was no

CIA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his Mexico trip
or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a cabled
request: on 15 October, the Mexico Station had no photo of OSWALD
in its records, nor did it receive one from Headquarters -- which

did not have one either.-- before 22 November 1963.

9. -It must .be stressed that what technical information the
Station had was not (and normally is not) ‘processed in "real
time. The means of acquisition and the volume of ‘the: infor-

mation preclude anything. but the spot reporting of items judged

“to be of more than ordinary interest and, therefore, noted in

summary logs. Full texts of selected items require consultation

of the tape and either a full transcription or full translation

“or both. Photo coverage tends to become available in quantity . -

lots which requires scanning and selection on a rapid and

“accelerated basis in four or five day "peaks." One. of the

"triggers" ‘that normally operates to focus. and accelerate more

speedy review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is’

the mention of a name. ‘This was precisely what occurred: in- the

“second of two conversations on 1. October, during which the

speaker said he was "Lee OSWALD." It was” this information -

"reported by the Station to Headquarters in its first indication

on OSWALD on 8 October. 1963.

‘10. -The Mexico. Station did one more thing in its 8 October

report on Lee OSWALD based on the 1 October information: “it

coupled the data with descriptive information it had acquired. _

‘from a sensitive source -- a photograph of a male individual,

apparently an American, who was observed entering an Embassy ~

on‘1 October. The Station reported this detail on the 8th as

a matter of coincident fact. The Station did not assert or

suggest that the data led to any deduction that the photo’ was in.
