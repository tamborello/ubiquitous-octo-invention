It is noted that the above information concerns
all information involving GUSSIE ALEX which was supplied by
CG 6343-C* during the period 9/2/60 through 12/8/60.

On 8/5/60, RUSSELL LANG, Manager of the Kahler
Hotel, Rochester, Minnesota, advised SA ROBERT L, CARLSON
that GUS ALEX telephonically contacted him on 8/3 or 8/4/60
and requested a reservation at the hotel for EUGENE BERNSTEIN,
a Chicago Attorney, whanALEX referred to in conversation with
LANG as "my very good friend." It is noted that EUGENE
BERNSTEIN is a Chicago tax attorney with offices at 77 West
Washington in Chicago and that he has prepared income tax
returns during the past ten or 15 years for almost all Chicago
top hoodlums including ALEX. It is also noted that BERNSTEIN
has recently been very seriously ill with cancer of the
throat and it is felt very possible that the reason for his
visit to Rochester, Minnesota, involved treatment for this
condition at Mayo Clinic in Rochester,

It is noted that the Minneapolis Office has
previously instructed that the identity of Mr. LANG should be
protected at all times.

‘On 8/5/60, PCI TURA SATANA advised SA WILLIAM Fo
ROEMER that she was in contact with GUS ALEX five or six ~-
times during the two-week period prior to contact with her on
8/5/60. .It is noted TURA SATANA is one of the leading burlesque
dancers in this country and that she has been intimately
associated with ALEX and with HENRY SUSK during the past two
or three years. Miss SATANA advised that she believed she
saw ALEX every night during the week of 7/25/60 during the
evening hours at the Pontiac Agency of HENRY SUSK in the
1600 block of North Clark and accompanied him to the Red Star
Inn in the vicinity. She stated that on each occasion ALEX
was accompanied by his chauffeur, NATHAN "Butch" LADON, She
noted that it did not appear to her that ALEX was anxious
‘to get hometo his wife on these occasions. She also noted
that ALEX and SUSK no longer utilized Suite 14 E at the
St. Clair Hotel in order to entertain their girl friends.
It is noted that SUSK formerly maintained this suite under
the name JOE HENRY and that it has been utilized by practically
all Chicago top hoodlums. including ALEX during the past
couple of years.

“Due to the fact that on 9/21/60, ce 6343-C*
advised that ALEX was at that time out of town "visiting his

ALEX: That's all, NICK.

a From the above conversation between ALEX and BENEDETTO,
it would appear likely that the net profits from gambling in
the First Ward. during the month of August, 1960, amounted to
$12,194. It would not seem clear that this.is.a net figure
since it is possible that the $12,194 is a gross figure ..

_ including that amount of money due to the individual. book-. ;
makers. located in the First Ward... However,. from the experience
of the agents assigned to the Top Hoodlum Program, .it ‘would
seem that there are sufficient. handbooks located in the. First
Ward so that $12,000 would be a net figure after the. handbook
operators got their 50% cut. In this regard it is noted that
CG 6272-C has advised that ALEX has organized all handbook ;

\ operators in the First Ward under an arrangement whereby they _ _

' retain 50% of their profit and furnish the other 50% to the

ALEX organization, ordinarily through LOUIE BRIATTA. ;

: ; ._ GG 6343-C* advised that following the above conversation,
ALEX and FERRARO went over more figures and the shuffling and
counting of money was heard for an additional half hour or so.

vo _, CG 6343-C* also advised that during that. half hour

FERRARO was heard to make the following comment: . "We made
J it on the 6 for 5. 28 thousand. What do we get, 24, 52".
From the above it is apparent that FERRARO referred to the
“shylocking" or "6 for 5" business which ALEX controls in

the First Ward of Chicago. a

 

 

- CG 6232-C has advised that this business is..very pro-
ductive for ALEX in the First Ward, and that ordinarily "6 for
5" refers to the fact that ALEX and his subordinates loan

I'm there, All right. Oh sure. If you don't ,
_hear from me that means that I won't be there.

But I'm pretty sure that I will. Okay. No
. I won't be able to stay. I'm going to send BUTCH
? up there... I*°1ll call you one way. or the other.

I can't I have to work here. Know what I mean.

And they're not open tomorrow, that's why I have
to go today. I'll call you up there.

.Concerning ALEX's reference above to an airplane
flight which he intended to take, it is noted that investiga-
tion had been conducted at all airline offices concerning the
possibility of. locating ALEX's destination. It is noted that
the only possibility in this regard was TWA flight 436 which
leaves Midway Airport in Chicago daily at 1:45 p.m. and arrives
in South Bend, Indiana,. at 2:21 p.m, South Bend, Indiana, is
approximately 24 miles from Cassopolis, Michigan, where SAMMY
ALEX, a brother of GUS, has a 100 acre farm. It is noted that
considerable information has been, developed in the past con-
cerning the, fact that ALEX frequently. visits his brother's
farm and the Detroit Office has conducted a great deal of
investigation there concerning. the location of the farm, the
people involved, etc. It would, therefore, appear that ALEX
and LADON. were intending to fly with an ultimate destination
of Cassopolis. .

 

It ‘is noted. that PCI TURA SATANA has: advised that
LADON recently was confined to Columbus Hospital in Chicago
with prostrate trouble. It is therefore possible that LADON
intended to convalesce at the ALEX farm in Cassopolis.

. CG 6343-C* advised. on “September. 19, 1960, . that
MURRAY HUMPHREYS met with JACKIE CERONE and later GUS ALEX,
. Their conversation as ; best. determined by the informant was
as follows: :

HUMPHREYS: It's tough to get old and get. that way.
CERONE : A- ‘Lot of strange stuff.

HUMPHREYS: See, the only thing is, the Government! 8 voing to

. come back with all these things first,.you know.
And.the G guys to say that they interviewed,.'em
and that we didn’ t sell ‘em beer, Then.we say
that we did sell ‘em beer. How they gonna ovércome
it? It winds up a draw, doesn't it? What did
you do over the week end?

record. So come on out. PETE the Greek wanted
me to go out with him and I said, no, I wont go.
I had nothing to do with it but he gets mad at me.
MOONEY does. Not that I give a (obscene), but why
should he get mad at. me? So I wanted to tell MOE
what happened. He says what in the hell is PETE:

\ doing with the guy? Listen, GUSSIE, MOE wants me.
to get wrecked. I know that. I just want to clear
it first, ‘cause, Jesus Christ, you know, the. roof
caves in and he gets mad at everybody... Now, I
should'a told CURLEY. CURLEY wanted me to put
and I didn't want to put the kid in there, Did
I do right" That's what I want-to tell HUMP. I-
could put the kid in there, but I think its wrong.
to put the kid in there and make him an artist. I.
could put him on the payroll tomorrow. Let him work
there. ;

 

FERRARO: Well, maybe its the experience he wants.

HENRY : Well all right, then I'll do it. I just thought
the kid was better off. ,

Shortly after this conversation, many men appeared
at. Celano's and apparently joined ALEX and FERRARO in several
drinks from CELANO's bar>‘and all appeared to be in a highly
jovial frame of mind. During this party ALEX was observed
yelling to HENRY, who was in the other room, as follows:

"He tells me STEVIE has got ‘em in tights now too!"
HENRY answered, "No, in nightgowns, in little nightgowns'"

From the above this. would appear to identify’ HENRY
as. : HENRY SUSK, prominent Chicago Pontiac dealer. It is. noted
that PCI. TURA SATANA has advised .that HENRY SUSK is, in her.
opinion, -the owner. of the Huckster's Key Club located on the
near North Side of the City of Chicago. It is noted that this
private club during the week of above conversation initiated
a practice designed to compete with the Gaslight Club and
the Play Boy Club in Chicago by dressing their waitresses
in shorty. nightgowns. It is noted that this PCI is one of
the leading burlesque dancers in the country and is intimately
‘associated with SUSK and ALEX,
