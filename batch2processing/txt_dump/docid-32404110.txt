Dear Ms. Denk:

(C) Re: ARRB Request No. CIA-10, for Information
on the Interagency Source Register (ISR)

(U) The following is responsive to referent request.

(C) The ISR is simply a device whereby agencies within
the intelligence community which recruit or deal with
sources of foreign positive intelligence outside the United
States try to keep from bumping into each other in the :
pursuit of such information. It is for the further purpose
of ensuring a source cannot gain an unwarranted - advantage by
dealing with more than one agency. Each agency is
responsible for registering an individual as a source with
the ISR before using the individual.

(C) The ISR was established in 1957 by the Intelligence
Advisory Committee, predecessor to the U.S. Intelligence
Board. The ISR was not used extensively during the years
1958-1965 and we know of no system or procedure which took
its place.

(C) The first ISR regulations were in the form of basic
procedures each agency was to follow, procedures which have

‘gone through a number of reiterations. ARRB staff members

have reviewed the classified, current written instruction
governing the existence and use of the ISR.

(U) I believe that this information is fully responsive
to your request on the ISR and accordingly, completes our
work on CIA-10.

Sincerely,

J. Barry Harrelson
