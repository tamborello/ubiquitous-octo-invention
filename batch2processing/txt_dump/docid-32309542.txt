for this office, advising that investigation in the instant case
had been discontinued in the United States, but that the Habana

‘A check of the vecords. of the Cuban Gabinete Nacional

Habana, Guba; was employed for ten years at the Montmartre \, sl, ia a)

ment running gambling tables at the Montmartre- night elub and
other gambling establishments in Habana and thus rose above
Habana's lowest criminal element. This source stated he believed
BUSTO was the type who would do anything for money. He based
