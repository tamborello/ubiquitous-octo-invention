. LITENSOR said that he would give CURTIS all information
i Mexico had on Communism. He said he wished CURTIS to send
ASCHAM all information available in Mexico on eubversion. He
i said that he was very happy with the present arrangements

where we have complete exchange of information between himeelf
and ASCHAM's organization.

Both LITENSOK: and ASCHAM expressed tonfidence in
having CURTIS as the channel between them.

Finally, LITENSOR, said he wished ASCHAM to know that
he waa "withus'’. He said there is a Mexican Saying: "Each
person has his own method of killing fleas," and said that some-

times his method of “killing fleao'' might be different from that
which we would use.

—_ ASCHAM said "Just so we both kill them!"

LITENSOF. then said he had asked the Mexican Ambassador in
Washington to tell Secretary Herter, and he would like ASCHAM
to do the same, that although at times Mexico took a different road
from that taken by the U.S.A. the aim was to arrive at the same
place (in this fight against Communism).

LITENSOR was well pleased with the model pistol given to
him by ASCHAM. He called it “Preciosa” and said he had a “passion
for firearms". He said it would occupy the principal spot in his
collection.

He said that in Venezuela the problem is different; there the
“fertile soil for Communist subversion is found in Caracas in

the large number of unemployed. LITENSOB. said that Mexico
because of the success of her revolution and because of the
agrarian reform program which has been carried out could

resist Communism. He added that there were some thirty (leading)
Communists whose names and sayings appear over and over again
and who hope to establieh Communism there but he indicated that
they would not succeed.

LITENSOR then named some Communist leaders he now has
in jail: He named Demetrio VALLEJO, Dionisio ENCINA,
Valentin CAMPA, David ALFARO Siqueiros, and others. He said
i : he felt sure that the great majority of Mexicans are in favor of
his jailing these Communist leaders.

ASCHAM said President BETANCOURT was a capable man
but Venezuela was in a dangerous position. LITENSOR agreed
that BETANCOURT was “un hombre muy capaz"'~-but said BETAN-
COURT was in great difficulty.

LITENSOBR. said that Latin America's great need was for
long term, low interest loans for social development and housing.

; ASCHAM told. LITENSOR that private enterprise in the U.S.A.
had become frightened or concerned by the loss of near one billion
dollars (which they would probably never recover) in Cuba. ASCHAM
also said that, speaking frankly, U.S. businessmen had become

wary over certain etatemente and actions even in Mexico.

LITENSOB said his remark of 1960 that the Mexican Govern-
ment was "of the extreme left within the Constitution" had been mis-
represented by the press. He eaid they had frequently left out
“within the Constitution" and had made it appear that he had meant
merely “of the extreme left" and, hence, Communistically inclined.

LITENSOR himself brought up the Latin American Peace Con-
gress which is to be held in Mexico City in March 1961. He said
the Communists have chosen (for them) a very propitious time to
have this Congress in Mexico. He said: The railway workers'

 

: HW 53320 DocId:32401389 Page 5
union in Mexico will be re-negotiating a contract (and he did not
add Demetrio VALLEJO Martinez, their Communist leader, is

in Jail); the professional schools in Mexico will be opening a new
term; a new Rector will just have been chosen for the National
(Autonomous) University of Mexico (and he did not add that the
Communists will either have had a man acceptable to them chosen
or will be causing troubles over whomever else is selected).

ASCHAM aeked why LITENSOR could not preventthis
Latin American Peace Congress being held in Mexico. LITENSOR
said that he could not prevent its being held because of guarantees
of the Mexican Constitution. (He failed to mention not giving visas
to foreign Communists). LITENSOR said he preferred to have the
i : Congress held in Mexico to having it held in certain other Latin
i American countries. He said ‘we have better facilities for
coverage and control" in Mexice.

LITENSOR said the Congress would be unpleasant for him
personally because he would be vigorously attacked on the subject
of political prisoners. He added that, despite the high-sounding
and noble cause of peace which this Congress would pretend to
advocate, it was a Communist tool. He said the high-sounding
i “Peace" objectives had caused a number of well-meaning non-
Communists to get themselves involved in the World Peace Council.

At ASCHAM's suggestion, LITENSOR agreed to assist in
whatever he possibly could to disrupt and hamper this Peace Congress.
ASCHAM said we (KUBARK) would send some ideas and suggestions
on actions which might be taken to disrupt thie Congress. ASCHAM
told. LITENSOR that our new Government in Washington and U. S.
Businessmen would find it hard to understand why Mexico could
allow these Communists to assemble in Mexico and attack the U.S.A.

LITENSOR said he understood this; but reiterated that Con-
i atitutional guarantees of free speech and freedom of thought made it
imposeible to prevent this meeting.

LITENSOR told ASCHAM that he had complete confidence in
LIERGO and LIELEGANT and that they too would help in any way.
they could (along with him) in the fight against Communiam.

LITENSOR atated that he had been looking forward to meeting ASCHAM
for many months. He then said he would have known ASCHAM (in any

: place they might have met) to be related to his brother because of their
i physical resemblance. He talked of his two hour meeting with ASCHAM's
1 brother im December 1958; be said he found ASCHAM's brother te be
| exactly the opposite of the way he was depicted in newspapers. ASCHAM's
brother had an excellent sense of humor; they had several good jokes during
1 the two hour conversation. LITENSOR said he knew in December 1958 that

LITENSOK, also eaid he had known ASCHAM's nephew well for a five-
year period when LITENSOK. handled labor. He said this young man was
so modest that he (LITENSOR) had not realized until after the five years

: that he was the son of ASCHAM’s brother. He found ASCHAM's nephew
discreet, intelligent and an honest person whom he (LITENSOF) enjoyed
dealing with.

ASCHAM tola LITENSOR that he too had looked forward for many
months to this meeting. ASCHAM said he had anticipated having a dis-
cussion of mutual problems with LITENSOR

a problem for all Latin America as well as for the U.S.A. He said —
we in the U.S. Government are anxious to get the opinions of
Latin American Governmenta concerning possible solutions to the
Cuban problem--and we would hope that a majority of Latin American
‘ countries would join ue in solving this problem.

     

LITENSOEF, said Cuba wad not just a hemispheric problem but
was a world problem.

ASCHAM expressed doubt about the wisdom of bringing
European countries into this Western Hemisphere problem;
and with thie make it very difficult to deny that Russia, Com-
munist China and Czechoslovakia had rights to help solve this
Cuban problem. LITENSOR then backed off his point and agreed
that Europe should not be brought in. He said Mexico from events
: of the nineteenth century has very good historical reasons for
wishing to keep Europe out of Latin American internal (to the

Western hemisphere) problems.

LITENSOR said Mexico had a strict policy based upon a

! principle which forbade their interference in the internal affairs

i of any other country. For this reason he hoped the Cubans could
get rid of CASTRO and Communism and settle their probleme £
themselves.

ASCHAM said that with CASTRO's dictatorship and the
Sovicts, Communist Chinese and Czechoslovakians help it would
be very hard for the Cuban people to establish a good government.

LITENSOR said he would like to know the truth about the

\ feelings of the (majority of) Cuban people on the subjects of CASTRO
and Communism. He added that he did not feel the Cuban people

1 were people who could endure hardships and be disciplined as could
the Chinese. He said Mexicans could live ten years off herbs and

\ still fight for their revolution--but he believes the Cuban people
lack fiber of this kind. He said he believed that whether or not
CASTRO lasts for three years more will depend upon whether or
not Cubans get sufficient foad. He believes this constant parading
by the Cuban militia and these expressions of fear of an invasion

by the U.S.A. are crazy.

ASCHAM told him that these militia had to work during the day
' and parade at night; as a result the work is certain to suffer, these
workers will be too tired to do much.

' LITENSOR said the U.S.A. could look upon the Cuban Cam-
: munist problem ae one of an ‘international character" since there
was absolutely no chance of Castroism having any real internal

effect in the U.S.A. and its government. He said Mexico, on the

 

 

oat

HW 53320 DocId:32401389 Page 3
 

‘other hand, and he (LITENSOR) had to consider the possibility «
of internal security problems in Mexico because of Castroism.
LITENSOR eaid there is a large body of aympathy for CASTRO.
and his Revalution in Mexico.

 
   
 

LITENSOR said this factor (cf Mexican sympathy for CASTRQ)
had to be weighed by LITENSOR. in all actions concerning Cuba.
For this reason, he added, no overt action to overthrow CASTRO \
could be taken by Mexico. He said he personally wanted to get rid
of CASTRO, and to have Cuba become a democracy; he offered to
consider any recommended action by Mexico which ASCHAM wanted.
He eaid that if ASCHAM would send CURTIS any such recommenda
tion he and CURTIS would "analyze" it and he (LITENSOR) would
then determine whether or not he could take the action. He said
there are many things we should be able to do “baneath the table".

ASCHAM agreed.

LITENSOF. said that he personally was surprised when CASTRO
i adopted Communism. He said that when CASTRO was in Mexico
; he did not agree with Comnmnism; LITENSOR said he knew this
from several reliable Mexicans who knew CASTRO at this time.
ASCHAM eaid there was no doubt now but. that Cuba was in the hands
of the Communists.

 

LITENSOR eaid he attributed the failure of the Cuban Revolu-
tion te achieve its original (worthy) objectives to the youth,
inexperience and lack of ability of leaders--including CASTRO.

ASCHAM said that CASTRO is not content to have Communism
in Cuba; he is ambitious; he wishes to spread his philosophy to
other Latin American countries. ASCHAM spoke of the precarious
position of Venezuela and said that Peru, Colombia and some other
Latin American countries were having troubles as well.

LITENSOR eaid that in many Latin American countries the
Communists and CASTRO find fertile ground for their subversion
because the land in some of these countries (he did not specify
any country) is held by a very few individuals while the masses
live lives of misery and have no hopes under the present systems.
