CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS

One "T symbol" has been assigned to each cl, PCI or other
source required to be concealed, throughout the course of reporting
instant investigation, Thus, T= 1 or T-21 in early reports is the
same individuel as T+1 or Te2l in any later report, This system was
adopted before the current regulation requiring that informants in
each office territory be identified with the name of that office
preceding the symbol number, In view of the large number of T
informants in this lavestigation (131) and to avoid confusion in
review, it being noted that in each report only a portion of all
the informants are mentioned, no change-over has been: made and all
the informants continue to carry the designation Albany T-1, etc.,
instead of New York T-10, Los Angeles T-5 and so on,

The identitssof T symbol informants in the enclosed report
are as follows:
