OCCURRENCE:

On October 27, 1960 the Special Group read a paper outlining " the proposal

to aid Colonel Mobutu in working toward the eventual formation of a moderate
government...".

The Special Group approved the proposal with the understanding that the program
envisages complete recognition of Kasavubu as the legitimate head of state and
that Mobutu would remain in the background."

Mr. Merchant reported on discussions with Hammarskjold: "He has swung away
from a feeling that Lamumba must be removed, to a feeling that is the legitimate

prime minister and that we much live with him although acknowledging that his
title is somewhat clouded."

lines included various political efforts and "The group agreed that the action
contemplated is very much.in order." _.

There was also discussion which might be construed to refer to_an assassination

attempt: "Mr. Gray conmented, however, that his associates /The President?/
had expressed extremely. strong feelings on the necessity for very
straightforward action in this situation, and he wondered whether the
plans as outlined would be sufficient to accomplish this. Mr. Dulles

OCCURRENCE: /
On May 21, 1975 in an affidavit to the Rockefeller Commission Mr. Douglas Dillon stated

that in late July or early August of 1960 in attended a meeting in the Pentagon in which

the overall Congo problem was discussed. He state: "During the discussion, which covered
a great variety of matters, my recollection is that a question regarding a possibility of
an assassination attempt against Lamumba was briefly raised. The CIA representative indi-
cated that the agency did not undertake this sort of operation. This ended consideration

of this subject. With this one exception I never heard any discussion of assassination
attempts against anyone." ,
