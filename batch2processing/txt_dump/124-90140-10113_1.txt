on the VASQUEZ property near Princeton, Fla. on 8/26/60, Mr.
AL TARABOCHIA, Deputy, Dade County Department of Public Safety,
advised this matter was still under investigation by his office,

HW 50953

On 8/27/60, Mrs. VASQUEZ advised that she was becom-
ing desperate, because she and her husband had about a hundred
men who were anxious to participate in some action against
CASTRO; that she had planned to place these men at another camp
or on an island, and that she had been unable to receive any
satisfaction concerning the situation from Colonel MIGUEL PONS
of Washington, DC. She also stated she learned from Deputies
CLODE and LEONARD of the Dade County Department of Public
Safety, that the five American boys from Homestead who created
the incident,above, described, were to be charged with some
criminal violation by the sheriff's office, and that the Cubans
would merely be charged with vagrancy at most.

On 8/30/60, Mrs. VASQUEZ said that Deputies CLODE
and LEONARD told her that there was no reason why she should
not place an additional hundred men on this property, that the
sheriff's office intended to drop all charges against the Cubans.

Mrs. VASQUEZ states she now has 32 men at this camp. She
also stated that she was becoming more and more desperate about
the situation, fand she desired, if possible, to make direct
contact with a representative of CIA concerning this matter IGQ (Ut)

It is to be noted that at no time has the Miami Office
ever disclosed or indicated in any way to Mr. and Mrs. VASQUEZ
that CIA had any interest in MIGUEL PONS, her camp, or the
xecent sabotage boat trip to Cuba. RY) .

@- Above request of Mrs. VASQUEZ was conveyed immediately
Rin £ CIA, who stated that he would like to have Mr.
ROBERT HOPKINS, overt CIA representative in Miami, contact Mrs.
VASQUEZ and her husband, in order to remove the burden of this

matter from the FBI, although at that point, he was uncertain
as to whether or not CIA would be able to use them.
