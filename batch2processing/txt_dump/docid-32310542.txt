was the police official contacted by DR Consulate, Miami,
' for liaison purposes and once accepted invitation of Dominican
government to visit DR. It is further. noted that MM 768-C
on October 26, 1961, advised that ROBERT EMMETT JOHNSON, self-
described foreign affairs analyst for former Dominican leader
RAFAEL L. TRUJILLO MOLINA, 1956-60, claimed to MM 768-C that
SAPP for years had sold information to the Dominican government
and that the files in the DR should show this; however, it is
, ~.moted that JOHNSON was interviewed on two separate occasions
by the’Miami Office as a résult of his claims to knowledge of
Dominican intelligence operations. When specifically questioned
for positive information, he claimed to have no specific
knowledge.

It is further reflected in Miami files that on
October 12, 1958, EDUARDO HERNANDEZ, then serving as Cuban
Consul in Miami (identity should be protected), advised SA
ROBERT JAMES DWYER that Detective CHARLES SAPP of the Miami
Police Department had informed HERNANDEZ of the arrest of
HUGO GONZALEZ LAJONCHERE and furnished HERNANDEZ with a. police
report on the matter. HERNANDEZ had been contacted in connec-
tion with investigation of the case entitled "SERGIO SANJENIS
CABARROCAS, aka; ET AL," Bufile 2-1505. This case dealt with
the investigation of the possible formation of a demolition .
team to.operate against the then Cuban government which y
HERNANDEZ. then represented in Miami.

Miami files reflect that SAPP has in the past
furnished information in connection with criminal intelligence
matters to the Miami Office and continues to do so at the
present. time in connection with the hoodlum program.

On February 9, 1962, Lieutenant CLODOVEO EDMUNDO
//a, XNORTIZYCONZALEZ, former functionary of the SIM, informed~
———— “ “Specdal Agents JOSEPH L'ITALIEN and HEINRICH VON ECKARDT
that he did not know the full name of anyone named Sargento
Chars H. but that a few years ago, while visiting the captain
of the yacht which belonged to the then Dominican leader
RAFAEL L. TRUJILLO MOLINA, ORTIZ.heard from the crew that - bo
TRUJILLO had a close friend in Miami who was a Sergeant in
the Miami Police Department. When the yacht visited Miami,
-a Sergeant CHARLES would meet the yacht, board it, and state
that he was a personal friend of TRUJILLO. ORTIZ said that
he did not know this individual personally and could furnish
no further information concerning him.

 

-On March 6, 1962, MM T-1, a former D-R . official
who knows the subject, advised that Sergeant CHARLES H. SAPP
of the Miami Police Department Intelligence Unit had for
years been the person contacted by the Dominican Consulate
in matters requiring liaison between the Dominican Republic
Consulate and Miami police authorities. The informant said
that on one occasion some time ago, exact date not recalled,
SAPP and some other police officer were invited to take a
trip to the DR as guests of the government and SAPP made
the trip. Informant said that SAPP never acted as an agent
of the Dominican government and never received any money
for anything which he did as far as is known to the infor-
mant. Informant stated that the expenses of the trip to .
the DR were probably paid for by the Dominican government :
but the informant had no specific proof of this.
