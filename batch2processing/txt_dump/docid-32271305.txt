to denigrate the value of the information provided on
the unidentified alleged Cubana Airlines and unidenti-
fied passenger do not diminish the apparent negligence
of the agency in seriously pursuing the information as
it was received. The CIA is not to be faulted for the
strength of its intelligence gathering, but rather

for the judgement which kept that intelligence from the
Warren Commission. (The Warren Commission’ was mandated
to pass on the strength of exactly that kind of informa-
tion.)

Depsite what is now know about the alleged delay

of the Cubana Airlines flight and the unidentified pas-

sengéer, the Warren Commission may have wanted to abrigate

 

suspicions which would remain, and satisfy itself that

these circumstances did not indicate foreign involvement

the alleged activity involving the private twin-engined -
aircraft and passenger would have gone unnoticed or
unreported had it occurred. (1977 CIA I.G. Report,

TAB B, p. 12.)

Presumably, the discrepancies pointed out by the

'Inspector General are meant to explain the fact that

the CIA did not take more aggressive investigative

steps to ascertain whether there might have been some
connection between the delayed flight and the assassina-
tion of John F. Kennedy. In that regard, the 1977 In-
spector General report explains that the Agency had car-
ried the lead as far as it was able by reviewing the
surveillance file of the LIFRE and LIENVOY operations and

asking the Mexican surveillance team {(LITEMFO) about

 

any strange occurrences at the airport on November 22, -

(Ibid., p. 11) In addition, telephone tap operations
(LIENVOY) against the Cuban Embassy provided transcripts
-of conversations between the Cubana Airlines Office and
the Mexican Airport control Office. (Ibid., p. 11.)

The LIENVOY transcripts recorded a series of dis-
cussions concerning the status of the November 22, 1963
delayed Cubana flight--when it arrived and when it de-
parted. The transcripts showed that the flight arrived
at the airport at 1620 hours (All times used will be
Mexico City time to avoid confusion) Mexico City time.
(HSCA Staff Review of November 22, 1963 LIENVOY trans~
cripts) Prior to the arrival of the aircraft, one per-
son stated that the aircraft was due at 1630 hours and
"it will go" at 17390, suggesting a quick turnaround that
would have reduced unloading and loading time, as well as

: serving of aircraft to. a relatively § short period. (bid. )

‘Mexican surveillance team reported the arrival or depar-
ture flights of the November 22, 1963 Cubana Airlines
flight to Cuba) then I.G. concluded that there were major
differences between what the Senate Select Committee re-
ported about the alleged delayed Cubana flight and the
known facts. (Iibid., p. 12) The Cuban flight was on

the ground in Mexico City for a total of four hours and
about ten minutes. (Ibid. p. 12) It was not delayed five
hours as reported in Book V. (The Investigation of the
Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Performance of
the Intelligence Agencies, Book V, Senate Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations, 4/23/76, p. 30, Senate

One such lead discussed was a reported five-

hour delay (6:00 p.m. EST to 11:00 p.m. EST) of a Cu-

 

bana flight from Mexico City to Havana the evening of
President Kennedy's assassination, November 22, 1963.
(The Investigation of the Assassination of President
John F.. Kennedy: Performance of the Intelligence Agen-
cies, Book V, Select Committee to Study Governmental
Operations, 4/23/76, p. 30, Senate Report No. 94-755.)

The most intriguing aspect of the SSC account involved | |

 

the alleged delay of a Cubana flight to await the arri-
val at 10:30 p.m. EST of aprivate twin-engined aircraft.

(Ibid. p. 60.) The aircraft deposited an unidentified

passenger who boarded the Cubana aircraft without cus~ !
toms clearance and traveled to Havana in ‘the pilot's
cabin. (Ibia., p. 61.) The source of that lead was an

Italian diplomate, Mario Mauri, who allegedly was on the :

The Inspector General's report corrected the state-
ment in the Senate report that the "Central Intelligence
Agency had noX information indicating that a following
investigation was conducted to determine that a follow-
ing investigation was conducted to determine the iden-
tity of the passenger and had no further information
on the passenger, and no explanation for why a following
investigation was not conducted." (The Investigation of

mance of the Intelligence Agencies, Book V, Select com-
mittee to Study Governmental Operations, 4/23/76, p. 30,
