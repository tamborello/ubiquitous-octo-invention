~-6 said that in the LA ROCCA residence - ‘seven. murders were
committed within the period of a few years and that no one
was ever prosecuted for any. of these murders. - Informant
said that in 1922 JOHN LA ROCCA attempted to kill TERESA.
TRONZO and then after this attack the families of TRONZO
and LA ROCCA were constantly at odds:and that they all
earried firearms. T-6 said that the LA ROCCA family had
threatened to kidnap TERESA TRONZO and place her in a
house of prostitution unless the charges against ‘LA ROCCA
were dropped. (This offense has been previously reported
under the caption "Criminal Record.")

In October, 1942, Captain W. I. ‘ENGLISH, U.S. Engineers’ .

Office, Pittsburgh, advised SA DANTE DE LILLO that he had ©

information that JOHN LA ROCCA's- liaison with. the. Superin-

tendent of Police in Pittsburgh | was through one GEORGE

MESSER. (MESSER admittedly has been a partner to LA ROCCA

i in the numbers business in the East Liberty section of - .
Pittsburgh. ).

On. August 21,.. 1946; MESSER advised that he felt. that an
attempt. on his lite was brought about by JOHN LA ROCCA and .
‘that LA ROCCA's attempt to squeeze him out of business was
the purpose for this attempt. MESSER said that LA ROCCA
had exclusive numbers rights in the Eighth Ward and also
rights in part of the Thirteenth Ward of Pittsburgh.

on December 13, 1957, T-7, a representative of another
Government agency, advised that one MIKE GABLE and PRANK
VALENTI ‘and AL LADISH, now deceased, illegally entered the
residence of an individual and stole from the premises a

-45 caliber automatic pistol... T-7 stated that this allegedly
occurred in 1942, 1943 or 1944, This source said that FRANK
VALENTI left this gun with JOHN LA ROCCA for safekeeping

and that at a later date this same gun was used to kill one
GUS ‘GIANNI. T-7 said that his source claimed that FRANK
VALENTI had told many times that no act could be committed
without the permission of JOHN LA ROCCA and that because of
this the source felt that LA ROCCA had knowledge.of, and
concurred with, the murder of. GUS GIANNI.

T- -7 further advised that CARLA FERRARI, who was: a paramour
_of FRANK VALENTI at the time of the FREDDIE GARROW a

exist any longer because they have all been confiscated by
the Pennsylvania State Police during their various raids.

On February 27, 1958, GEORGE MESSER advised SA VOEGE that
he had been in the numbers writing activity since about
1928 and is still active in this regard. He said that most
of Pittsburgh's present day ‘big racket men" once depended
on him solely for protection purposes since he knew local
and state police figures and recalled that JOHN LA ROCCA
was one of these racketeers. MESSER stated that LA ROCCA
pecame acquainted with him in about 1941 or 1942 when
LA ROCCA was. handling all the numbers activity in the East
Liberty section of Pittsburgh and had set himself up as a
"little God." When LA ROCCA became dissatisfied with his
financial gains, he left Pittsburgh on a trip to Chicago
to see friends about paste reel machines with which he felt
he could make more money. MESSER said a paste reel was
Similar to a "one-armed bandit" with the exception that a
small paper-wrapped mint was dispensed after the coin was
placed in the slot and the play was registered. The —
Chicago manufacturer of this machine circumvented the
"strictly for gambling purposes" phraseology in the law in
this manner. .

While LA ROCCA was in Chicago, MESSER said he moved into the
East Liberty section and took over the entire numbers |
operation. He turned in his numbers returns to one GEORGE
CHRISTY (now deceased) in Pittsburgh. When LA ROCCA returned
to Pittsburgh he became angry with "MESSER and his move and
had someone drive a car over MESSER one night as he was
crossing a street. MESSER said when he was discharged from
the hospital he found out that his automobile had numerous
bullet holes in it. MESSER said that because he thought

he would make money in the East Liberty section he stayed

in the business of writing numbers and actually forced

LA ROCCA out of the numbers business.

MESSER advised that in about 1943 he and LA ROCCA became

friendly and LA ROCCA invited him to share equally in the '
ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company which
later set up offices at.5746 Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh.

MESSER recalled that LA ROCCA was completely bankrupt at

that time because of numbers setbacks but managed to raise

DETAILS:
A, PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND
1. Birth Data

Tal, a reliable source abroad, advised on April 30, 1958,
that SEBASTIAN LA ROCCA, the son of IGNAZIO and ROSARIA
SCANCARELLO, was born at Villa Rosa, Italy, on December 19,
1901. LA ROCCA departed Villa Rosa before 1927, the year
in which the registration of the inhabitants of. the com-
munity of Villa Rosa was begun.

2. citizenship Status

On December 12, 1957, SA WILLTAM R, WALL ascertained from

the records of the Immigration-and Naturalization: Service
(INS), Pittsburgh, Pa., that JOHN LA ROCCA entered the United
States on September 2;-1910; at New York, New York; aboard
the "Principe De Piemonte. "

These same INS records show that on May 12, 1950, LA. ROGCA
applied for U. S. citizenship. On January -20, 1953,
deportation warrant was issued for LA ROCCA by the district
Director, INS, Philadelphia, Pa.; said warrant was based on
Sections 241 (a) (4) and 212 (a)(12) of the Immigration
Nationality Act. He was arrested January 21, 1953, and
subsequently given a deportation hearing as an-undesirable
alien. This undesirable status was based on previous arrests
involving LA ROCCA on criminal-type charges. On August 31,
1953, LA ROCCA testified before an INS Hearing Board that he |
had been involved in the numbers racket, bootlegging, and
slot machines, but added that he was no-longer. involved in
anything other than legitimate enterprises. The "Pittsburgh
Press," a Pittsburgh daily newspaper, publicized portions of
LA ROCCA's testimony.on November 10, 1954, and reported that
LA ROCCA had testified that his financial holdings amounted
to approximately one-quarter of a million dollars and if
permitted to remain in the United States; LA ROCCA testified
he would not become a burden of the state.

A news release of the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" dated May 15,
1957, reported in part that a Federal indictment against
ex-racketeer JOHN LA ROCCA was ordered reinstated by the |
Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, Pa. In an
article dated October 11, 1957, this same newspaper reported
that LA ROCCA went on trial in Federal Court charged with
perjury and making false statements in connection with his
deportation hearing. Then on October 15, 1957, this same
newspaper reported in part that Federal Judge RABE F, MARSH
had ordered JOHN LA ROCCA acquitted on charges of perjury
and making false statements in connection. with his deporta-
tion hearing. Judge MARSH ruled that the Government had
failed to show clear and convincing proof to back up its
charges.

HAROLD LAUVER, Investigator, Immigration and Naturalization
Service, Pittsburgh, advised SA ROBERT A. VOEGE on March 13,
1958, that his office planned to take action concerning the -

-Betition of Naturalization filed by LA ROCCA on May 12, 1950,

and which had never been acted upon. Mr. LAUVER stated that

-although LA ROCCA had made no new request and had not "pushed"

for action to be taken on the petition filed, his office was
setting up a hearing and was gathering information regarding
LA ROCCA's moral character, known recent criminal associates
and identities of persons willing to bestity against LA ROCGA.

3. Education a

T-1 advised on April 20, 1958, that it was not possible to
ascertain whether or not LA ROCCA received any formal schooling
during the time that he was in Italy.

on February 13, 1958, FLOYD 0.. ‘SMITH, Supervising Principal,
and THOMAS J. ADDLEMAN, High School Principal, both of
Shannock Valley Joint School District, which includes Yates- -
boro, Pa., where LA ROCCA formerly resided, advised that the
Old Yatesboro School had been abandoned-and that records :
of attendance are not available for students who attended
from thirty to forty years ago. Both advised that although
they have been residents of Rural Valley-Yatesboro area for
forty or more years, they could not recall the LA ROCCA
family. . ;

With, regard to LA ROCCA's present residence, it is pointed

out that CASIMER J. PELLEGRINI, owner, Casimer J. Pellegrini
Associates, 201 South Craig Street, Pittsburgh, advised

SA ROBERT A VOEGE on April 24, 1958, that he designed and
directed the building of the home in which LA ROCCA now lives
and which he owns. He said that to duplicate this home today |
would cost between $150,000 to $175,000.

It is pointed out that LA ROCCA's whereabouts have not been
known to individuals in his neighborhood or to other avail-
able sources since about December, 1957. It is also pointed
out that the U. S. Marshal's Office in Pittsburgh has had a
subpoena for LA ROCCA to appear before a New York investigating
committee with ‘regard to LA ROCCA's possible presence at the
November 14, 1957, meeting at Apalachin, N. Y.
