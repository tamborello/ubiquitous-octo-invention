would approve of the action which he took. (2) ()

and the fines, it is possible that MANUEM/GARCIA. DEIABUSTO.... 4/4
a wealthy Cuban who has worked.with, CIA the past; was the
individual to whom ESTRADA-might have gone for the money ¢ u(

MANUEL GARCIA DEL BUSTO, Atlantic Tank Service,
Greenwich Street, NYC, advised on 7/21/65 that he had not
given ENRIQUE ESTRADA any money for the trip of Cuban exiles
to Washington, D.C. on 3/7/65, nor had he given ESTRADA $500
to pay the fines for the exiles arrested in Washington, D.C.
on 3/7/65.

The NYO contemplates no further contact with ENRIQUE
ESTRADA on this matter as he has in the past clearly indicated
