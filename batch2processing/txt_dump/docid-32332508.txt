of a gesture on the part of the FEU with no intention of anyone going to

That there is a definite tie-in between gome elements of the FEU
and Guatemala is demonstrated by the following: - a .

On May 25, 1954, a source at the Bureau of Investigations .

the FEU and that in this connection on May 22, 1954, at 1:15 P.M.
following telephone call from the FEU telephone was intercepted. a

Caracas Conference, rather than with any intention of recruiting people to
go to Guatemala to fight. The committee have every evidence of being
strongly backed by the local Communists if not actually organized by then.
CI HAV-2-S submitted the following summary concerning the activities of
this committee: . *
uv . ,

The recently organized "Comite Pro-Gratemala” of Cuba issued its

first public document last March 11, 1954. It follows?
%

"to the public opinion of Cuba and America.
ee

"The efforts of. the people of Guatemala and of its last two
governments to rescue the national richness and organize it to the service
of the nation and of the Guatemalan people, specially the Agrarian Reform
tending to expropriate the enormous holdings of the United Fruit Company,
have encountered an echo of sympathy in all America. The form in which
Guatemala has carried forward this nationalist policy, for the benefit of
all the sectors, of the peasantry and of the exploited Indian, through the
scrupulous authorization of the Constitution and the Law, and compensating

the Companies and individual owners, makes. even more respectable this. ra
democratic program. However, against Guatemala are directed today,
furiously, the forces. that insist in maintaining our countries under the

economic yoke and the most abominable backwardness. The United Fruit and
the representatives of this exploiting policy, have organized numerous:
attempts to oust by. violence: the Government of Guatemala; even now, this
Government has in forced to denounce a plot to Invade the country in
which aré involyéd notorious dictators such as AMSTASIO ani

RAFA NIDA: JILLO. And as a complement of these criminal designs,
they are planning to use the Caracas Conference -held in a country where
thousands of men are in jail for defending democracy -, with the presence
of representatives of governments created through coups d'etat, to favor
the interference in the sister country and violate ite sovereignty.

"It is necessary that the democratic forces of America. impede
this crime. It is possible that meny Americans who work hard to achieve .
the independent development of our countries may not agree with all the {
aspects of the interml policies of Guatemala. But nobody with aims of
freedom, democracy and national progress, can remin indifferent before
the grim attempt to suffocate the just national aspirations of the sister i
country. As in the case of Mexico and the oil expropriations of LAZARO !
CARDENAS, the destiny of Guatemala represents today the possibility of
constructing a Latin America free from oppressing ties. . :
