participated in the investigation and arrest of the subjects on 1/27/60.

Valdes had arrived in Miami from Cuba and was seeking contact with local
bolicé officer who would be willing to assist Cuban agents in-abducting

   

Rolando Masfer rT; anti-Castro leader. Miami arranged to have an agent, ™
SA William B. alloman, pose as local deputy sheriff and thereafter meet ;
with Valdes | tami hotel room. -At meeting, Valdes was accompanied by

Fernandez, representative of Cuban Wattorel Policey and Valdes. prepoc’” “oned
Holloman to assist in abduction of Masferrer for $25, 000. At conélusion :
of meeting and by prearranged signal, other Miami agents moved in and
arrested subjects on kidnap = conspiracy charge, a complaint having
breviously been authorized that day by local U.S. attorney. Subjects
