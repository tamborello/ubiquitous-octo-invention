DEAN first called the Chicago Office in August, 1960,
to report that he had been elected Recording Secretary, Chicago
Chapter, Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC). He did not

information concerning the leadership of this organization,
and said that he would be amenable to an interview with an
agent of the FBI.

charges. GRABOVAC said DEAN was a self-employed plasterer.

turbing a religious meeting and two arrests for using
indecent and obscene language. He was also AWOL from Fort
