6. Daily Routine:

a. The wake-up call was at 0700 in the morning. The
NCO on duty would come through the rooms and wake up anyone who
was still in bed. Source added that it was done in a true
"military fashion". The student had only a few minutes to put on
his jogging suit and to fall out for the morning roll call.
There was no time to brush the teeth or to wash the face. :

b. Following the roll call, the officer on duty opened
the main gate and the entire course (all four cycles) would go on
a 6km jogging run near the river and through the near-by park.
Source added that they would also pass the house where Lee Harvey
OSWALD used to live while in Minsk.
