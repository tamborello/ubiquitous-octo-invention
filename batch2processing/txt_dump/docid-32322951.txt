According to Informant, in December, 1961, Waikiki
Savings and Loan Association entered into an agreement with
the various unions who are members of Unity House, where
Waikiki Savings and Loan Association issued one share of
stock of the association to each member of the various unions
at Unity House, and the Unions agreed to open a $5 account in
the name of each member of the unions. Under the agreement,
the individual members had complete control of their share
of stock, and their $5 account. Informant noted that many of
the members have either sold their stock, and/or closed out
their account since December, 1961. Informant does not know 3
exactly how many shares of Waikiki Savings and Loan stock eawewcre .
disbursed in this manner, but believes the figure to total
between 6,500 shares and 8,500 shares.

Informant stated that prior to this distribution,
the legal problems connected with such disbursement was discussed
with various attorneys, and it was their opinion that the
disbursement was entirely legal.

‘ Informant said that no Teamsters money was involved
in the setting up of Waikiki Savings and Loan Association, and
that the Teamsters Union has absolutely nothing to do with
the ownership and/or management of Waikiki Savings and Loan
Association. Informant noted that some of the Teamsters
locals located in Honolulu might have. deposits in this
association, however, he has no definite information on this ;
point. \

 

 

Informant said the only Teamster official who
has any gtock in Waikiki Savings and Loan Association is
R » @ Teamster international organizer from St.
fouis, Missouri. KAWNER was an original subscriber to 500
shares of the original stock of the association, which
stock was sold at $1.50 per’share. Informant stated that
at the present time, Waikiki Savings and Loan Association is
a closed corporation; however, plans are under way to make a
public offering of stock which will take place in approximately
one year.

( (2) Informgat advised that some time ago, MATHEW
arlene rehased a block op<fva Plantation, stock, and that informant :
ve Sined MATHEW in this venture. According to informant,
: “Castle and Cooke, one of the big five in Honolulu, presently
“" own 51 per cent of Ewa Plantation stock. Informant said that |
some time ago, MATHEW made a complete study of Ewa Plantation
stock, and noted that the stockwds selling for approximately
$20 per share. It was MATHEW's opinion that the stock should
be selling at approximately $100 per share, and he was of
the opinion that Castle and Cooke was deliberately holding
the price down. Since Castle and Cooke owned 51 per cent of
the stock, they also had control of all of the Board of
Divectors of Ewa Plantation, and according to MATHEW, were
able to run the company for their own: benefit, —

_ Subsequently, MATHEW began purchasing Ewa i
Plantation stock, and at the present time, MATHEW and
his friends, who include the informant, own approximately
44 per cent of the stock, and at the next meeting of the
stockholders, MATHEW's group intends to obtain two seats
on the Board of Directors.

Informant stated that MATHEW hasvbeen having
discussions with Castle and Cook, and has offered to sell
Castle and Cooke all of the stock "8 controls at $50 per
share, or purchase all of the stock presently owned by Castle
and Cooke for $50 per share. Informant believes that this
situation will. be cleared up within the next three months,
and that either Castle and Cooke will buy the stock controlled
by MATHEW, or MATHEW will buy Castle and Cooke's stock,

 

Informant stated that nothing illegal is involved
in this situation, and that MATHEW is a shrewd enough
operator to be able to see that Castle and Cooke was
deliberately depressing the ‘Ewa Plantation stock, and is a
big enough man in the financial world to take advantage of
such a situation.

 

(3) Informant stated that he maintains two
offices in the Unity House in Honolulu, out of which he is
‘engaged in an import business, buying merchandise from Japan.
Informant stated that he has just started this business
