MEMORANDUM FOR: ‘chief, wD
SUBJECT ‘: | Material for possible Use in Discussion with Mr. Pawloy

‘l. The following are excerpts from a memorardum of conversation between
Thomas Jd. Flores and Jack Gillespie, dated 16 December 1959: +

Francisco ¢, CAJIGAS told GILLESPIE on 15 Decenber that wiliten
PAWLEY «ia back in Washington; that Generalisaimo THUJILIO had told
him (CAJIGAS) tliat PAWLEY had promised that he would have tnfoxmation
on the U. 3. offictal position on the Cuban matter within three days;
that an important person from thé Dominican Republic would go to the ~~
United States on 15 December to meet with PAWLEY on 15 to 16 December;
and that he (TRUJILLO) would hold the PEDRAZA forces until the United
States' position was known. On 16 December GILLESPIE said that ho
had received a call from Euilio NUNEZ Portuondo the night before and
NUNEZ said he had just secn PAWLEY, after the latter had dined with
Vice President NIXON, According to NUNEZ, PAWLEY claimed that: he
was to méet with the DCI at C900 on 16 December. NUNEZ also said
that TRUJILLO would not allow the revolutionary srmy to leave the
Deninican Republic without the approval of the United States Government.

Coument; NUNEZ, CASICAS, and GILLESPIE are mown to dislike
and/or distrust PAWLEY. PAWLEY's tecent break’ with NUNEZ is well
Igiown. CAJIGAS saya he fears and dislikes PAWLEY because of some
earlier transactions in Cuba dh which both were involved; he fears
PAWLEY's support of TRUJILLO which might involve scme future coumit-
ments; and considers PAWLEY "a meddler” who does more harm than good
to the Cuban cause. GILLESPIE has expressed persorul distrust of
PAWLEY and.said he had discussed PAWLEY with H. Graham Morison, former.
Assistant Attorney General now a prominent Washington attorney; MORISON
spoke adversely of PAWLEY, wham he characterized as a great opportunist.
GILLESPIZ considers CAJICAS a “great gentleman" and hes urged that
someone in CIA talk to him. Bernard REICHHARDT is also favorably
impressed by CAJIGAS and bas described hir as one of the most objective
and responsible Cubans he has talked to in Miami. :

ve

2. Recently the FBI reported (the DBF te being eirevlated and is not

Be

readily avaflable) that PAWLEY had been meeting with several Cuban exiles at the:
Mayflower Hotel and on leaving the meeting he told them he was going to meet
with Allen Dulles and Richard Nixon. Comment: This DBF. aloo said thet
PAWLEY had been known to compare THIJILLO with Abruhan Lincoln.
