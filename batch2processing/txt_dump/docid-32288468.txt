“MARCI: - We'll see. We're down flat..
STEVE: That's what I told him. I said you can hear a lot

‘of (obs) stories, but you can. take my word for it, MORGAN,
that we're flattened down completely. If there's anything

. going, they are going'on their own. There's nothing to do
with the chief (ph).. All right. he says.. What if he wants _

- to make a meet with somebody, all right I says you tell me
what he wants to do and I can set up a meet for him.

“MARCI: OK. Tell him you can't do nothing til we let you
know.

The above is. intéresting in that it lends credence
: ' “to the opinion held by Agents working top hoodlums matters)
eo in the Chicago Division to the effect that gambling has ’'been
‘down especially in the Loop area of Chicago. This also
‘would furnish a reason why MARCI, working on behalf of the
Syndicate, has worked so’ hard on the operations of strip.
: joints within the Loop, this being the main source of . -
| os revenue to top syndicate leaders at this time. Recent -
po , contact with CG 6443-C has developed that 50% of all proceeds
: from Loop strip joints with the exception of those operated.
i by LOUIE ARGER are given to the Syndicate. Because of: :
: ARGER's close relationship to GUS ALEX only 20% of the.
i proceeds of his clubs are turned over. It is interesting
! to note that these people feel that RIORDAN is now ready
‘to. be reached and that gambling can again be opened up . ; .
in this district. Following the departure of this indivi-. | 4
dual, D'ARCO and MARCI returned for a short while to a
discussion regarding the ‘Alderman’ s job which is as follows: cot

 

- D "ARCO: We'd heard about it if he was in the precinct. ,
i ue . BUDDY (JACOBSON) would shave heard.

MARCI:- He doésn't hear (obs). He'd run into him and think :

- ; nothing of it. Would you think anything of it? oo Lol
soy} . . .

D'ARCO;: GUSSIE told me “to tell BUDDY. _ Not to tell BUDDY

.. that he's workin’ out of .... : os .

MARCI: | Does GUSSIE know if he told that to MOE? ; so

The last several hours of the day were spent
mostly in D'ARCO's office discussing the possible change in
the Alderman's job. The following text is self- explanatory
with the exception of the fact that the TONY mentioned is
identical to ANTHONY GIROLAMI, Cook County | Probate Clerk,
who is a close friend of D' ARCO and who is identical with
CG 6498-PC. The conversation was as follows:

D'ARCO; You' got to tell. those guys PAT. If they want me
out tell ‘em I'm sick,

MARCI: I'll tell ‘em. Hell, I'm sick too, and I'm not
going to break in some new guy.

D' ARCO: It will work ‘out, don't you think.

MARCI: Yeah, don't worry.

D'ARCO: They must of talked about this before.

MARCI: JOHN, SLIM didn’t know a (obs) thing about it.

You mean TONY and them guys.
D'ARCO: Yeah, Listen, how are we gonna work this deal?

MARCI: ‘Don' t worry JOHN, we'll. (obs) him enough to get
him killed.

D'ARCO: | You know how I'd like to work this, I'a like to be.
the Alderman and let someone else be the ward
committeeman, And then will be ...the election.

MARCI: Let's not talk about it. Let's see if we can get it
straightened out first. .

JOHN calls BUDDY JACOBSON and tells him to come

to the office right away.

; D'ARCO returns to his office where several conver-
sations take place. JACOBSON arrives and goes into D'ARCO's
office. Door closes. Even with door closed D'ARCO can be
heard screaming loudly. Very excited. "I've always stood
up for you." "I said MOE I won't stay here." ‘They don't
say nothing, until after it's over." "MOE..." D'ARCO is
talking. about MOE continually now. Can't be picked up
clearly. . : .
