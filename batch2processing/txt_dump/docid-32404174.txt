SUBJECT: DCI Sources and Methods Authority With Respect to JFK
Assassination Records :

(A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently
requires protection; .

(B) an intelligence source or method which is
currently utilized, or reasonably expected to be
utilized, by the United States Government and which has
not been officially disclosed, the disclosure of which
would interfere with the conduct of intelligence
activities; or

 

 

 

(C) any other matter currently relating to...
intelligence operations ... the disclosure of which
would demonstrably impair the national security of the
United States."

 

ARCA § 6(1) (Emphasis added.)

4. The originating agency is to make the first review to
identify information that meets the standards for postponement.
ARCA § 4(c)(2)(D) (i). For CIA, this effort is being undertaken
by the Historical Review Group, in consultation with the
Directorate of Operations and other appropriate Agency
components. Information the originating agencies identify for
postponement must be transmitted to the Review Board. ARCA
§ 4(c) (2) (E). The Review Board "shall consider and render
decisions on a determination by a Government office to seek to

postpone the disclosure of assassination reccrds." ARCA §
.7(i) (1). Specifically, the "Review Board shal consider and
render decisions on ... whether an assassination record or

particular information in a record qualifies for postponement of
disclosure under the Act." ARCA § 7({i) (2) (B).

5. If the Review Board determines to order the disclosure
of information that. the originating agency feit met the criteria
for postponement, it "shall notify the head cf the originating
body of its determination and publish a copy of the determination
in the Federal Register within 14 days after the determination is
made." ARCA § 9(c) (4) (A). If the information contained in an
assassination record is "obtained or developed solely within the
executive branch, the President shall have the sole and
nondelegable authority to require the disclosure or postponement
of ... the information under the standards set forth in
Section 6." ARCA § 9(d)(1) (emphasis added). The President's
decision must be certified to the Review Board within 30 days of

_,the Review Boards determination. Id. Records postponed by the
“president must be re-reviewed every 5 years. ARCA § 9(d) (2).
