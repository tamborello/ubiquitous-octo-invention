Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Act of 1992 (the Act)
Synopsis: The JFK Task Force (JFKTF) requests Dallas to search
for records and forward records to the JFKTF.

Enclosure: ARRB letter requesting material; a copy of EC dated
4/1/97 requesting Dallas files 176-PCI and 137-1292.

Details: In 1992, Congress signed the Act mandating federal

O ' agencies to release all documents concerning the presidential
assassination or information related by conspiracy theory to the ~
assassination. The Act narrowly defined the types of information
that agencies could still protect by postponement until the year
2017. The Act also established the Board as a separate entity to
oversee the release of material from federal agencies to the
National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Beyond the
Board's oversight responsibilities, the Act charged the Board
with the duties of reviewing agencies' proposed postponements
with the agencies' evidence for approval or denial and
researching additional areas of information for any new material
related to the assassination. The FBI has been working with the

Board since its inception to meet “ne Far AG oad he $133

On November 29, 1996, the oh: w. i a letter to th

FBI setting forth a formal compliance program. The letter
-requested the FBI's cooperation with the Board “in discharging
its responsibility of assuring Congress and the American people
that the goals of the JFK Act will be accomplished to the
greatest reasonable extent.” The compliance program is the
Board's answer to demonstrating “to the American public that a
thorough, good-faith, and diligent effort has been made to locate
and release all remaining assassination-related records within
the control of the United States government (and that the
Government is not hiding any such materials from public
disclosure).” With this philosophy in mind, the Board has

C forwarded letters to the FBI requesting additional information
for their review and possible inclusion in the JFK collection.

Re: 62C-HQ-1029205, 04/30/1998

On 03/19/97, the JFKTF received a letter from the Board
requesting Dallas field office informant files. The JFKTF sent
an EC dated 04/01/97 requesting Dallas files 176-PCI and 137-
1292. The records of the JFKTF show no documentation that these
files were sent to HQ or were not located at Dallas. The JFKTF
therefore requests that Dallas conduct a search of its office for
these files and forward the documents, if located, to the JFKTF.

The original documents are necessary to meet the
requirements of the Act. Should the Board determine the
documents to be assassination records the originals will
eventually be transferred to NARA. Therefore, any responsive
documents should be copied before forwarding to the JFKTF. If
the Board decides the documents do not fall within the realm of
the Act, the documents will be returned to your office, but not
until the Board completes this project.

Dallas should respond even if the search is negative.
The response is important for the FBI's compliance with the Act.

If you have any questions, please contact Catherine Lamey at
(202) 324-6185.
