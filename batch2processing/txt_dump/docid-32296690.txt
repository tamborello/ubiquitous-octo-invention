membership in Miami and in the New York ~. New Jersey areas.

In August 1973, it was reported that RODRIGUEZ disclosed that..
‘the ASI and JCR had agreed secretly with these other ‘groups in.
New ‘York City to earry out attacks in that city.

On October: A, 1973, information was reported that

two Cuban fishing boats were attacked off the north coast of |

Cuba. A Havana radio broadcast. identified these boats at. the,

and the JCR appear: to be velatively dormant at the present
time. He advised that CONRADO RODRIGUEZ SANCHEZ, head of
the ASI and a Director of JCR, is circulating around
Dr. MANOLO REYES of Miami who has aspirations of becoming
President of a Cuban government in exile, however, REYES has
been unable to build up a following of. any significant
proportion.

It has been previously reported that action members &

of the ASI, ABDALA and the Golden Falcons have joined together S
to forma small terrorist organization. known as the Frente de si

Liferacion Nacional (FLNC) which..claims credit for a number of
attacks against Cuban fishing boats, the bombing of the 7
"“Mereghan-II" and two bombing attacks against the Cuban Embassy

in Mexico City during the past few months. However, investi=
