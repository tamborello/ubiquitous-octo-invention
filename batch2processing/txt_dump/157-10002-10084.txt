So they had agents in Cuba that were reporting foreign

reporting to them along the same lines that we did. ‘they'dia

Mr. Baron. In terms of paramilitary operations, if an
assassination operation had been run by Task Force W, would
you have assumed as Chief of Station in Miami you would have
been aware of such an operation?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not assume that.

Mr. Baron. Would it not have been sound managerial
dractice to let you know that thare was an operation that might
have been run through Florida into Cuba?

Mr. Halley. No.

You know, the Agency is a highly compartmented mechanism.
You know, let us dispel one thing very promptly here. If you

are asking me was I aware of all these contacts, you know, with

the Mafia -- and I think I can tell you frankly at that time I.

‘ 14 | Special Group in the White House which was part of the National

17 Mr. Halley. My understanding at the time that I conducted

19 | which was headed by Mr. Robert Kennedy that was conducting a

: 20 || survey to see what kind of activities could be conducted against

put them into rubber rafts, where they would paddle in or use
a silent outboard motor if the surf was high.

Mr. Baron. The people involved in manning those crafts
would not necessarily be employees of the Station directly?
They might be agents, even non-paid agents?

Mr. Halley. No, they were not paid. For instance, they
might work for a particular covar company. In other words, I
am only using this as an example. Let us say we had the ABC
Shipping Company. That shipping company’ was a subsidiary of
the Station, if you will,and the ABC Shipping Company ran
maybe one LCI and maybe two or three smaller boats which it
could deck load and that company might have fifty or seventy-
five employees, as an example, all Cubans, maybe some of them
was Nicaraguans or Costa Ricans as most of these vessels -- I
would have to go and look at each vessel.

Does that give you a feel for the size of the problem?

Mr. Baron. How many such companies would have been in
existence at that time, companies operating as CIA proprietaries
or companies in cover and supplying the JMWAVE Station with
personnel or with equipment?

Mr. Halley. We are talking about all of these companies,

they probably § I distinguish between

 

i
companies that were set up simply to provide cover as opposed
to companies that were proprietaries. You know, these terms

mean different things to me. The nature of the Agency's
