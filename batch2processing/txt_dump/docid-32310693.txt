and many other rackets.

Mr. EDWARD JONES, Investigator, New York City
Anti-Crime Committee, advised that he had received information
from a confidential source, who has furnished him reliable
information in the past, that on the afternoon of May 18,

1956, there was a meeting. of about 35 of the top racketeers “ .
who are members of the Eastern Syndicate of the United ~ .

ness as the head of the Eastern Syndicate was at an end v
and that an election should be held for a replacement

to replace COSTELLO as hee the Eastern Syndicate and

Mr. JONES advised that Suite 2003 at the Hotel
St. Moritz was rented on a long-term basis by a garment
manufacturer, one LEO MORRIS, who is connected with the
furrier firm of Morris, Susking and Reich, 2.3 West 30th
Street, New York City. Mr. JONES advised that top
hoodlum BENi'Y LEVINE and Fontainebleau Hotel owner BEN
NOVAK and NOVAK's sister, own Laurels City Club, Sackett :
Lake, New York, which is a well known New York summer resort.

In regard to VINCENT ALO, Mr. JONES advised that
on September 12, 1956, VINCENT ALO, MEYER LANSKY and Mayor
. GROGAN, of Jersey City, New Jersay, met in a suite on the
‘> “twelfth floor of the Hotel Linecpln, New York City. /
— Aecording to Mr. JONES, HARTA RRANER owner_of the Hotel / 4’ 5”

, Lincoln, is a close friend of the well known hoodlum, OWNEY
‘MADDEN. MADDEN stays at the Hotel LincoIn when in New Yorr.—

° 3S stated that the manager of the Hotel Lincoln is a vy
mob contact, and that when VINCENT ALO visits the Hotel aa
Lincoln, he shakes’ hands with the manager, giving him a
$100 bill. :

NY 1h)9-C advised in regard to the racket set-up Vv
in the garment area that 2 gangs control all criminal -
activities in these areas. He stated that one of these f
gangs, which is headed by VITO GENOVESE, cotitrols the
Italian element in thése.areas. The other gang consists ~
of the control of the Jewish element which'is controlled
by MEYER LANSKY. The informant stated VITO GENOVESE is the
biggest Hoodlum in the United States today, and that only
one man -is stronger than G=NOVESE in the United States,
and that man is FLSHETTI of Chicago, Illinois, He stated
that because of the vast power that GENOVESE presently
holds in the United States, he cannot adequately place
too much control in one area. Hence, his control in
the garment area of New York City is rather loose, and
the Jewish Gangs apparently at the present time, have a
stricter enforcement code to control this specific area.

 

The informant furnished the following information
concerning the control in the garment area by the Jewish
Gangs:

He stated that MEYER LANSKY is presently the
top man in this area. He continued that LANSKY recently
