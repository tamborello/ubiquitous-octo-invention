lost plane. She recalled that the registration number of
the plane contained the numerals 37 or 47.

Mrs. GUTIERREZ stated she was aware of the
recent news release by the MIRR concerning the three
members of the MIRR and Comandos L who were reportedly
captured in Oriente Province, Cuba. She stated that
although she knew several members of the MIRR and had
heard the names of others mentioned in conversation at
her house, she had never heard of the three individuals who
were reportedly captured in Oriente Province.

On December 7, 1966, MM T-1, a former Cuban
official now resident of Miami, who keeps closely informed
of news reports emanating from Cuba,- advised that Cuban
radio stations have made no mention of the capture of
three infiltraters in Oriente Province as announced by
Dr. ORLANDO BOSCH of the MIRR. He pointed out that the
Cuban radio had announced the airplane attack on the
chemical plant at Matanzas on November 13, 1966, which
mission was subsequently announced by ORLANDO BOSCH at
Miami.

'

On December 7, 1966, MM T-2, a Cuban exile at
Miami active in anti-CASTRO organizations, advised that
no one that he or his associates had spoken to seemed to
know the three individuals who were identified in the
press release by the MIRR as captured in Oriente Province.
He stated that consensus of opinion is that this press
release is a fictitious story by BOSCH or at the very least
the three names furnished by BOSCH are not correct names,

With respect to the aerial mission by the MIRR
on the chemical plant at Matanzas. on November 13, 1966,
Mr. I. I. PROBST, Lally Adjustment Bureau, Miami, Florida,
advised on November 26, 1966 that his firm was in the
process of settling an insurance claim made by the
Gateway Corporation of Jacksonville, Florida, for the loss
of a Piper Aztec aircraft, a two engine; plane; valued at
