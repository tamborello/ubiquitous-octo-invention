17. The subject has been involved in an alleged
kidnapping, an assault and possibly espionage activities

while in Washington, D. C., which have been previously

reported to the Bureau. The tesur was instituted to broaden

our coverage of his activities. Specifically, following the

break in diplomatic relations between the United ates and

Cuba and prior to the discontinuance of tir 1133-sHP/it was
reported by that informant that the subject and the Cuban
OAS Mission in Washington, D. C., would be used as the
contact point for communications between various July 26
Movement groups and Havana, Cuba, possibly for espionage
purposes. Since the source is in a position to furnish
valuable information which could not be obtained elsewhere

and in order for the Bureau to be able to fulfill its
responsibilities in the security field, it is recommended

that. the coverage be continued for another 30 days, to afford

a fair evaluation of this source. At that time, this matter

will be re-evaluated and appropriate recommendations will be
submitted. : :
