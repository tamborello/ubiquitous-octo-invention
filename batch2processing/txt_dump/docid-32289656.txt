He is a “elose friend of ARTURO. ‘ESPAILLAT, the former
Dominican Consul General in New York City, He first met

ESPAILLAT when they: were boyhood companions in Ciudad Trujillo.

They served together in the Dominican Army and continued their
friendship in New York City. When HERRERA was in New York .

and was in need of money, ESPAILLAT furnished him with money .

in amounts ranging from $20 to $100. This was done because
HERRERA was broke and on the basis of their friendship.

HERRERA stated he is acquainted with FRANK CHAVEZ ,
of the Teamsters Union in San Juan. He first met CHAVEZ
in the Dominican Republic on a farm belonging to ARTURO ES-
PAILLAT near Cludad Trujillo, HERRERA believes this meeting
took place approximately eight to ten months previously.

he hoped CHAVEZ would be able to assist HERRERA to obtain a
better job in San Juan, When HERRERA returned to the San
Juanarea, he contacted CHAVEZ on six or seven occasions in
the Teamsters office, but when he realized that CHAVEZ would not
be able to help him, HERRERA discontinued his contacts with
CHAVEZ. HERRERA stated he has not attempted to arrange for de-
ilvery of any material to CHAVEZ and knows of no business
