Title: JOHN F. KENNEDY RECORDS
‘ COLLECTION ACT OF 1992 (The Act)

Synopsis: Searches completed and pertinent index cards and
search slips being forwarded to FBIHQ.

Enclosures: Original index cards and search slips relating to
this request.

Details: By EC dated 07/08/1998 to All Field Offices, each
office was requested to search indices for any additional
assassination related information which may have been placed on
record since the previous searches.

A search of Albany's General, ACS, and ELSUR indices
failed to reveal any additional information which has not been
previously reported to FBIHQ. In addition, a consultation with
the secretary to the SAC failed to reveal that any information is
stored in that office.

Pursuant to referenced EC, enclosed are the General and
ACS indices search slips on those individuals who had additional
aliases and the ELSUR indices search concerning all the
individuals.

Also enclosed are twenty (20) original indices cards
from the Albany Division. Copies have been retained in the

general indices.
