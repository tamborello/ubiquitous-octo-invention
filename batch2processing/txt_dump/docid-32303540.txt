In our correspondence dated November 23,

1965 on the CAPOLINOs et al, it was mentioned that the
CAPOLINOs were very provocative to their guide during their
recent hunting trip in the interior of British Columbia.

The guide in question was one Franz PRUCKL, who enjoys a
good reputation with the Provincial Game Department and
operates the Beaver Ranch Outfitters, P.O. Box 88, Cheywynd,
B.C.

2. Recently, PRUCKL complained to our Detach-
ment at Prince George, B.C. that he is being subjected to 4
malicious campaign bly the CAPOLINOs to discredit his reputation
as a big game, guide and outfitter. According to Mr. PRUCKL,’

one RobentanGNELLO y approximately 35 years of age, who operates
a Plumbing and Heating firm at 182 - 28 80th Drive, Jamaica,
New York 11432, is writing letters-to-various persons in the™
; wale “UHITSa-Stztes trying to bring discredit to PRUCKL's reputation.
0a or raooneoe PRUCKL advised our members that, in the Fali of 1964, he was a
— guide for Robert AGNELLO and that AGNELLO had left B.C. after
. his hunting expedition very satisfied with the treatment given
> to him by Mr. PRUCKL. However, since the CAPOLINOs™ returned to
New York from their hunting expedition with PRUCKL in September ~
1965, apparently, there is some indication that the CAPOLINOs
have now asked Robert AGNELLO to support their disapproval of
PRUCKL, According to PRUCKL, there is some suggestion that the
CAPOLINOs, by some unknown means, are pressuring AGNELLO into
supporting their attack against PRUCKL,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. _ From investigation and information received
to date, it appears that PRUCKL's accusations are factual and :

it appears that the CAPOLINOs and Robert AGNELLO ©
could have more than one motive in mind in their
present vindictiveness against Mr. PRUCKL. Under

the circumstances, we would appreciate any background
