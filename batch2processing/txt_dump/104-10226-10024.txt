1. Please pouch additional information about the
proposed development of “the new AMFRAHE orranization” in
order to enable Hoadquarters to determine if there is any
conflict with the intent of the LNLOFY action approving
the termination of AMSCROLL.

 
   
   
     
     
 

2. As you may recall, it was originally thought that
distribution of economic data might be handled by AHHIM,
after termination of ANSCROLL, possibly by creation of an
AKHIM economic desk staffed by former AHSCROLL employees,
In any event, neither Headquarters nor LNLOFPT anticipated
that the termination of one orgunization would be followod
by development of another conducting the same operational
activities. On the contrary, our presentation to LNLOPT
emphasized furthor reductions of organizational support.

 
   
     
   
     
     
   

 
 

3. In addition to a detailed description of the
proposed organization and related administrative and operational
cost estimates, plouse rorward more information abogt plans

for distribution of the new series.
