Dear ‘Gertrude: oo a ne Be

oe ‘It séens that’ ‘we wna’ oy too much .
tdine to pass between letters. By the time’ r get around
to writing you and Stefan, °% find I have forgotten :
many of the. things I wanted,to say, and regret that I i
have not, made notes of them from - one moment to another.

 

: He spent a day down a ‘Taguna Hills with {

3 verb ua Ann Morais) and of course we talked of you, and!
: they ‘sent their cordial greetings. ‘. : ‘ ..

i

ra 1. waint especially to ‘mention a book ye
= ___about-mhich zy. howe had: sone-comeasondence. with the..; | -
author, . Ethel Bertolini | *;-She'is.sériding you a copy, {
and I trust you will give it: {as Z am sure you will) |: }
your genérous attention, The.book, AND MY BEART WAS |
AT HOHE, a fictionialized,. semi-documentary account of
the. lifes of people who faced: the bitter struggle ‘
against deportation. These stories ‘of the foreign-born, i
and of the remarkable work-of the Committee: for’ their
defensd,have 2 warmth and honesty which stems from
the feeling which went into the book. . h a

“The book has received a remarkable
response from working people-- not only those who
“; were related ‘to this experience, but, in general people
who do.not take much interest. in. "literature" have found
something that touches and moves them-- and}I imagine
this would be true of this sort of pcopic ‘in other
countries, She has some remarkable letters of the sort)” “

 

Bloat

Sue and I are well, ‘and both of us are i:
working hard,. I received an “Anvitation from the filn hc

: association ‘ in Hoscow ‘to come to the cinema celebra- °-

tion of the fiftyeth.annivergary, but it is not at all‘ j *
possible for us. to go sor ondiingn or in the foresceahle
future, - t

As 3 have’ noted in prévious letters, | |
I an concentrating (along with many incidental and time-!-
consuming fasks) on my autobiography, I finished one et
volume risndnd only through the twenties, and received: j
some fjattering comments, but I, decided that-the first. j
volume had to go through the thirties ‘in order to jo $

‘face thel Sdcial-political issues. because the account of
the cultural meaning-of what is cailed."Commitment" -cnd
how it affects the arts ‘is the core of the book . 5 :
matters, in.my opinion, on which there is wonderful io
: confusion. : ,

I wish only that’ we could sit down ‘with you,
and Stefan and really talk about these things. It is 7
nice to imagine, and sad that it caunot be realized. }

 

'

Sue’ joins in “love to you both, Oe hy l,
