7. (Internal Use Only - LLM) LIAISON Met with Senator H. John
Heinz (R., Pa.) and his aide, Mark Bisnow, and reviewed with them the
information we had retrieved on the ownership of Air Taxi Company,
Senator Heinz had two additional questions and he had no problem with
having these questions go through Ken McLean, Staff Director, Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. The questions related
to whether we had made an inquiry of former COS' who served in Tehran
in early 1970 and whether we had any information on a showing in Iran

".. of a Bell Helicopter film which was attended by the Shah of Iran and

General Khatami. The tenor of the questions from Bisnow and the Senator ~
seemed to suggest that they felt we should have been more active in
investigating all aspects in Iran which may be of interest to the Banking
Committee, but I said that we had no way of knowing what that would be,

and the only way we could provide was on the basis of specific questions,

"and the Senator agreed.

8 (Internal Use Only - LLM) LIAISON Saw Mike Epstein, Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence staff, to determine what role the Committee

ww felt would be their responsibility to play in determining releasing and
_ controlling access to testimony and material developed by the Church

Committee which the staff of the House Select Committee on Assassinations _ ;
is interested in reviewing. /

forwarded to Dorothy Fosdick, of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations staff, one copy of a recent
speéch given by Chinese diplomat Liao Cheng Chih,

10, (Unclassified - RJK) LIAISON Talked to a member of

Representative Charles Bennett's (D., Fla.) staff in response to their

HW 53294 _

reminder that they had not received a response to the Congressman's

inquiry on behalf of their constituent, Marcus Conant. I advised her

that a response had been sent out from our office on Monday, 30 January 1978,
and apparently our two letters crossed in the mail,
