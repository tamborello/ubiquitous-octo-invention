"J am pointing it out in this connection because I
feel sure that further such actions are going to
follow. I remember that, for instance, Treskow told
me who, incidentally, spoke a gocd German, that Hitler
had been a great teacher, namely to create unrest as
in Czecho-Slovakia, Austria and Poland, to br about
dissatisfaction. And that is what we want. @) \

The neve ibsequently advised that it had caused a i
search to be @ of the records of the West German Ministry ‘
of Justice and could locate only two letters written by BUSKE :
to that Ministry these being dated September 10, 1963, and :
December 12, 1963. Both contained general’ statements to the ;
effect that BUSKE. had valuable information and requested an
opportunity to present it. Neither of these letters made any :
reference to the assassination of President KENNEDY in any context, ee)

The Bundeskriminalamt - (BKA - West German Federal

Criminal Police) informed that it had arranged to have BUSKE
interviewed with regard to his alleged information possibly
bearing on the assassination of President KENNEDY. The BKA

- furnished a statement dated at Stade, Germany, July 31, 1964,
and signed by BUSKE and witnessed by Kriminalkommissar KOLLECKER. '
