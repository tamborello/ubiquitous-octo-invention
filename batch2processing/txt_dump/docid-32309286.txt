in Detroit. FRENCH advised that GROSBERG apparently had no
first-hand knowledge of the matter and could not provide more
specific information; and it was believed that CROWTHERSS
information was hearsay.

On 10/21/63, DE 643-C, who is familiar with local |
bankruptcy matters, advised that CHARLES A, HORIST, former
president of Redford Iron Works, Inc, (RIW), had been
discharged in bankruptcy in U.S. District Court, Detroit; and
among the debts so discharged was a. $240,000.00 guaranty by
HORIST to Public Bank in regard to indebtedness of RIW. ; ;
Informant was advised by HORIST that he had lost his stock ,
in RIW through a "fast shuffle" involving HARRY LEVINE; IRWIN
KASOFF, an attorney characterized as LEVINE's "boy"; and
JOSEPH VERHELLE, former president of Public Bank. VERHELLE ‘
allegedly had exerted pressure upon HORIST by calling for
payment of loans made by the bank to RIW, Informant did not
have specific information as to the dealings between the
above-mentioned individuals but believed HORIST might be
willing to discuss the matter.
