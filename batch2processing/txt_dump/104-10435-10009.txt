(2) Ynvolvernent in Garrison's investigation:
Nona known te data. During the week 21-23 December
1967 several U.S. newspapers reported that on 20
December Garrison's office had accused one Edgar
Eugene BRADLEY of Nerth Hollywood, California, of
conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy. On 27
December he was arraigned on a fugitive complaint and
xeleased on his own recognizance. Extradition is currently
macot. There is no CIA record of Edgar Eugene BRADLEY:
On or about 20 Dece:mber 1967, however, the Washington

bureau of the Los Angeles Times rade an inquiry of the

A/DCI regarding Leslie Norman BRADLEY. The Newsweek
iseue of 3 January 1968 speculated that Garrison might

kave confused Edgar Eugene with either of two other mon,

one of whom is". . . a sometime New Orleans pilot

named Bradley who was once jailed in Cuba for anti-Castro
activities.” This description fits Leslie Norman BRADLEY.

a this request, Leslis Norman BRADLEY
was met by the DCS office in Minneapolis for ona
