Re request 3/26/76 from FBI to IPS to confirm our previous
concurrence in-release of Warren Commission Document #1247:

iy .
FBI Report ‘dated 22 June 1964, at Dallas, Texas, ,
Subject: Lydia Dymitruk, Internal Security - R.

As a result of a December 1975 request from the FBI fora
determination on FBI reports in the Oswald case held at NARS,
some unknown person in CI Staff advised DDO/PIC that FBI

report identified as Warren Commission Document #1247 could

be declassified. (See FBI memorandum dated 12 December 1975.)
This declassification of Warren Commission Document #1247

did not take place and FBI, on review, came to the decision
that it might not be wise to declassify thé entire report.

 

I have this date concurred in the suggestion of Mr. Howard,

FOI/FBI, that FBI not release this [nC
source of most of the information is th Mr.
Howard indicated he would record the faé a € Source
document for this information is in our Oswald release. ~--

. For Your Information: Declassification of Warren Commission
Document #1247 (based on Warren Commission Document #844)
was authorized as reflected in Mr, Briggs' memorandum of
19 December 1975 to IPS. (Warren Commission Document #844 --
CIA Memorandum to J, Lee Rankin of Warren Commission, dated
24 April 1964 -~ was not processed against the Oswald 201 and
appears neither in the released nor denied list of documents. A
check with NARS reflects that Warren Commission Document
#844 was authorized for release in its entirety earlier in 1975.)

The same information is reflected in the Oswald package as
Item #282 (partial declassification) identified as:

. CSCI to FBI dated 22 April 1964, Subject: Assassina-
tion of President John F. Kennedy - Bio Info on Lydia
Dimytruk.

Since Warren Commission Document #844 is declassified in
its entirety, it appears Oswald Document #282 should be con-

sidered for declagsification in its entirety.
