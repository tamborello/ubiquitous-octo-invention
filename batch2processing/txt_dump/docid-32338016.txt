SUBJECT: [RENE PELLEYA Y rostti] G) $
SOURCE OF INFORMATIO P {
Reference is made to memorandum dated 9/3/63, from Mr. |
Wannall to Mr. Sullivan. [Liaison was instructed to review with CIA 4 |
the subject’ s relationship with Margarita Madrazo, to pass on to CIA
subject's observations concerning Madrazo, inform CIA that we would (fg
‘like to have the subject contact Raul Roa, Jr., in Brazil and that th v/
subject would be made available to CIA for a briefing prior to his 4,
departure. The Liaison Agent was also instructed to explore with CIA
steps which could be taken to prevent Madrazo from interfering with or |
i
i

jeopardizing this mers" QW

A preliminary discussion concerning this matter was held F
with Austin Horn, CIA, on 9/6/63, at which time Horn stated it would
be necessary to confer with certain CIA officials. On 9/12/63, the
Liaison Agent met with Al Rodriguez and as a result of the discussion ’
held, Rodriguez made the following statements: AY |

1. CIA believes that subject's trip to Bravil could
“ ° be worthwhile and ere appears to be nothing to
. lose. CIA believeS that the chances of promoting

a defection of Roa, Jr., are slim but the subject '
possibly could develop information of interest RYY H
_If the subject travels to Brazil, CIA would like

to brief him prior to his departure. If subject

so desires, CIA will brief him in Washington, D.C.,
and the Agency will be willing to pay his traveling
expenses from Salt Lake City to Washington, D.C.
These expenses would also cover his return trip to

Salt Lake City in the event subject found it necessar
to return to Utah prior to his departure for Brazil. MOY ;

3.. In Brazil, CIA would plan to have some , contact
with subject since this could be necessary in
order to give him a channel for any assistance
he may need and at the -same. time CIA would be
in a position to furnish him any last minute
briefing. 60 w

4. At this point, CIA does not feel that it should
cover subject's travel to and from Brazil. In
the opinion of the Agency, the expenses to be
incurred for such a trip do not seem to be
warranted.

5. CIA would like to debrief the subject upon his

return from Brazil. Bu)
6. As far as CIA is concerned, the Agency will have

.no reason to have Margarita Madrazo become involved
in any aspects of this matter. CIA suggested that,
if possible, the subject not make any stop in
Miami where Madrazo is currently located. ‘BY
