MOE, I got enother SPOteeeccecevecececeees just like,
last week, when they came into the joint......... we
all ran down into the basement. This guy was there,
that guy was there.

I DON'T WANT THAT JOINT 1 BE A HANGOUT.

MOONEY}, THERE WONT BE A HANGOUT THERE. I don't give a (obs).
There wont be no hangout there.

The G is in and out of there all the time.-

That night, just before you came in, these guys are
sitting at tables, talking, yelling, bla, bla, bla.
They hurt you, if the G can hear them. Then when you
wall in, they shut up, and everybody is like a lamb.
They don't respect nobody, except you. If these guys
come in, you can't chase them out.

I don't want these guys hanging around there.

That one night you was there, I was there to see FRANK,

I ate, and I left. The next night you came, I was working
in the kitchen, they had a leak in there. I usually
stay by the liquor store.

All day long, the G spots you guys going in there.

Well, ote night, it was FRANK SARNO's birthday. There was
yor i E spything, I told the mayor, KxX#
6621-PC), I said, listen, you know,
you and QHUCKIE (CHAB NE), you made a (obs) out of
M@.eeeeeshe- (Changes tsubject). I went to see a joint
Ama on Ra Road and \Elmhurst Road, you know, where

that Randhurst Shoppin& Center is? We can get that joint.
A lot of traffic around’ there, big shopping centers.

But MOE, if you sell those guys something, you go a week
and you're out of business. Thet's the only thing.

But let me open up until I get one of these spots going.
Just for a week or ten days. That place, there are no
cars around there. We leave some cars at the Franklin
House, some cars at the O'Hare Inn. There wont be no

cars around. It ain't like before. We got to watch
everything. The night they pinched the big game out
