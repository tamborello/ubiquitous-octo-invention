MI 92-262

always thought the name was MACCALUCCI, but he assumes
the slight difference in pronunciation was his own
error, At any rate, it was from conversation with
TONY MACK and JOE ZITTO at Rockford on 8/8/64 that
informant learned of GALLO's visit to the United
States. Informant said on 8/26/64 that he had heard
no more about GALLO, but undoubtedly will the next
time he can get to Rockford. If any of this
information on GALLO's visit is set out in details of
a report, the fact informant is from Milwaukee, that
he learned of the above in Rockford or that he
learned same through TONY MACK and JOE ZITTO, should
be ommitted and confined to the administrative pages
for the informant's security. .

On 8/26/64 MI 623-C-TE advised that on the night of
8/23/64 GUS GIAVINGO of Chicago was in Milwaukee and
was in contact with FRANK BALISTRIERI, boss of the
Milwaukee outfit. They were seen together at Fazio's
on 5th Street and were with JOHN AIELLO, JERRY.

DI MAGGIO and several other Milwaukeeans. Informant
said he did not know GIAVINGO's purpose but would try
to find out. He said that GIAVINGO was very close

to TONY MACK, previously mentioned, and was a member
of La Cosa Nostra in Chicago. He said he was about
50 years of age, 6 feet tall, 200 pounds or more with
dark hair which was graying.

On mention of the name JERRY DI MAGGIO informant

stated that this was a member of the Milwaukee family

of La Cosa Nostra whom he had previously overlooked.

He said that DI MAGGIO worked as a bartender for

FRANK BALISTRIERI and was trusted by BALISTRIERT.

DI MAGGIO is also the nephew:of CARLO DI MAGGIO, a member
of the Milwaukee family of long standing. A new case

is being opened on DI MAGGIO,
