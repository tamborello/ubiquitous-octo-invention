(c= 10/2/ ref eo JOSEPH O'CONNOR reviewed
the file Bertaining to EDWARD K. MOSS, born 6/23/16, at
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, at the Visa Office, USDS, WDC,
and no additional pertinent information was noted therein

which would supplement that already in possession of the
FBI.

  

A review of WFO files reveals that EDWARD KIPER
MOSS is identical with Bureau file 121-39985,. CSC had
requested the Bureau to identify «a FBI source who had
provided information that one JULIA CELLINI had a business
connection with EDWARD K. MOSS, "reportedly a pervert."
WF 1086-C who provided the above information refused to
consider openly identifying himself or to furnish testi- ~
mony under any circumstances. WFO recommended that CSC
be advised the identity of seurce could not be disclosed.

Additional references in WFO files indicate
that MOSS has been registered as Foreign Agent for
foreign countries performing public relations activities.

(Since the purpose of the visit to the Czech
Embassy was for purposes of obtaining a visa and
since MOSS would have a legitimate reason for visiting
this embassy, WFO recommends no additional action at this
cine Bij iew of MOSS at this time does not appear (wy
wa iifedand there is yu) for developing him

as a secuFity informant. | X4) .
