NY 3368-C-TE informed SA WARREN J, DONOVAN that
an individual he knew only as IGGY LEONE was a member of

. cacao N: aes

° New York indices were reviewed and were negative
concerning the name IGGY LEONE, or variations thereof. On
September 5, 1963, JOSEPH VALACHI was interviewed specifically
concerning the identity of IGGY LEONE as a member of Cosa
Nostra, or for any information he might be able to furnish,
concerning this individual. VALACHI said that the hame was
unknown to him either as a true name or nickname. He had
never heard this name mentioned as either a member of Cosa
Nostra or as a member of the "GENOVESE family."

The records of the Bureau of Criminal Identification,
and of the Central Investigations Bureau, New York City Police
Department, as well as the Credit Bureau of Greater New York,
were checked and no record identifiable with IGGY LEONE
could be located.

On September 19, 1963, NY 3368-C-TE was reinterviewed
concerning IGGY LEONE, at which time he stated that he could
furnish no additional information or descriptive data concerning
him. Informants generally familiar with top hoodlum and anti-
racketeering matters in the New York area have been contacted,
and in the absence of a physical description, photograph,.
or other identifying data, were unable to identify\ IGGY LEONE
as anyone known to them,

Since all logical investigation to further’ identify
this individual has been unsuccessful, this case is being
closed at this time. It will be reopened if further information
is received in the future which can substantiate NY 3368-C-TE's

information or which can furnish essential descriptive a.
necessary to identify this individual. af. OS CY 7,
