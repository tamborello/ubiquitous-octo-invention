CO~2-32682

TO : PRS - Files DaTz: November 23, 1962

From : SA Charlie Taylor - FO

SUBJECT: Cuban Plot to Assassinate President Kennedy

At 9:00 p.m. on November 21, 1962, I picked up an original letter
from a Mr. Antonio Rodriguez, driver for the Venezuelan Nelegacion

to the International American Defense Board, 23535 Ashmead Place N, W
Washington, 9. C. :

Working with me in this case for the Tederal Burea

are SA L. 8B. ‘IcMonald and Joseph Scullay who may call y
or other material relating to this case,

u oof Investigation
ou regarding this letter

 

_The investigation has disclosed that the letter was mis-sent by the
Post. Office Department and we are presently trying to find out if there is
an Antonio Rodriguez here in Washington that was the intended recipient
of this letter... ce

‘The letter was addressed to. Antonio Rodreguez, 9246 7MNWos 11432 Se,
Washington, 0. C. nostmarked Havanna, Cuba, November 14, 1962. As translated
by SA. NcDOnald, FBI, letter-reads as follows: :

; Comrad Rodraguez

In accordance with the nlanning and insistent attitude of Xennedy
to invade Cuba carry out the criminal attempt against this. Person in
the terms made. I won't give you more instructions because it is not necessary,
all that you have to know you already know, and for its own secutity
and effectiveness of the planning, I comply thus with superior orders. I
have not had means of cammunicating this with you by any other safer means,
for that reason I did it in this letter, In the United States they are not int
habit of opening letters for that reason I trust everything will zo well. A
good communist has to run these risks. We have to count: on our own :
energies because the USSR (Russia) is not adopting with Cuba a solid position,
These are things of a high level that a good communist of action can't discuss
nor doubt. . Tf he does it thar wav it will he for the rood of all communists
that are in the world. Cuba is noc all, Enough has already been done by Cuba.

The. news that T will senel vou if [ am able (will be) by a Far safer
method. . Answer me soon, [ am embracing vou..

Pepe

The FRI has advised that a aumber of possible associations o
Antonio Rodreguez will be forthcoming and these should be cross r

eferenc
to the file,
