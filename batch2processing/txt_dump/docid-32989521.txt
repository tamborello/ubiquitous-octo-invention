ReButel 6/5/78.

Enclosed are two copies of Houston letter to Bureau

Nationalists—Hate Group, Racial Intelligence".

The above letter was in response to Bureau airtel
entitled the same dated 3/4/68, There is no indication
Houston was in receipt of Bureau letter to Albany dated
8/25/67 captioned the same.

It is noted that this letter only refers to one
individual, F. D. KIRKPATRICK followed by the initials "SCLC".
There is no indication in any Houston file of any further
effort with regard to either KIRKPATRICK or the "SCLC" in
general since neither are again mentioned in that file.
