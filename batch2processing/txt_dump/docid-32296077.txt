Enclosed for the assistance of Philadelphia is one photograph
each of Pittsburgh top hoodlums GABRIEL MANNARINO, FBI
No. 854850, and SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, FBI No. 96725.

For the benefit of Philadelphia, PG 545-C, who has furnished :
considerable information concerning subjects' legitimate . i
enterprises particularly real estate transactions involving

SAM MANNARINO, advised during 2/58 that SAM MANNARINO during
early 1957 mentioned he had purchased a hunting lodge surrounded
by 200 acres of land. At the time PG 545-C understood
MANNARINO to say the lodge was located in Somerset.County, Pa.,
and extensive investigation has been conducted to date in an
effort .to identify the hunting “ledge since several sources

here believe the lodge would be an excellent hide-out for
GABRIEL MANNARINO, who disappeared from New Kensington, Pa.,

during 12/57 to-avoid being served with a subpoena before. Lek
a Federal Grand Jury in the Southern District of New York |
inquiring into the significance of the conference of .
hoodlums at Apalachin, New York, 11/14/57. As a matter of
information; Senator JOHN MC CLELLAN, Chairman of the U. 8S.
Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor
or Management Field, has -issued statements to the press that
he corisiders GABRIEL MANNARINO one of the most important
witnesses yet to be heard by the committee, Since MANNARINO!'s
disappearance from New Kensington in 12/57 various reports
have been received that MANNARINO and LA ROCCA are hiding,

out together. |

In connection with efforts to identify the location of the |
hunting lodge PG 545-C on 10/28/58 learned through JACK
KRUPA, a New Kensington, Pa... councilman.and life-long friend . ;
and hunting companion of the MANNARINO brothers, that SAM — : '
/ MANNARINO's hunting: lodge is not located in ‘Somerset County, ;
Pa., but.is actually a twenty room farm house generally
. referred to as a hunting lodge surrounded by approximately
200 acres of densely wooded land in Pennsylvania near the — j
Pennsylvania-Maryland border approximately a fifteen minute
a@rive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland. PG-545-C
was unable to obtain any additional identifying information |
 “‘pecause of the likelihood of arising KRUPA's suspicions. |

 

‘Examination of available maps of the area indicate’ that ° 4
the hunting lodge must be located in Franklin County
probably in the general vicinity of Waynesboro and
Greencastle, Pa. .

 

PG 545-C also recalled that he was in SAM MANNARINO's office
at the Ken Iron and Steel Company, New Kensington, during
12/57, when the press and radio carried the first accounts
Fe . of MANNARINO being called before the Federal Grand Jury”
| in New York, Informant stated that while he was at the
office Deputy Marshals were attempting to locate GABRIEL . ‘
MANNARINO when. his brother SAM rectived a phone call from :
. GABRIEL MANNARINO and hurriedly told him "They are trying Lf
to serve you with a subpoena, take off for the prush."”
PG 545-c said that in view of MANNARINO's prolonged
; _ disappearance it seems logical to assume that if SAM

‘ : way of telling GABRIEL to hide outfiat the -hunting lodge.

With respect ‘to background. information eoncetning the ‘lodge tt
or farm house near the.Maryland border’ PG 545-C pointed _ . :
_ out. that KRUPA who has been a frequent visitor to the location
told him that. SAM MANNARINO has: several four-wheel - i
drives trucks .and other heavy equipment parked on the
property:that’ are used from time to time by some of the
local residents. Informant said that. according to. KRUPA.
the general area is thickly populated with whiskey :
stills and that local game’ wardens are: reluctant to ,
enter the area.apparently because some of them have been. I
mistaken for ATU Agents and fired upon by moonshiners. ;
PG” 5A5=6° also developed from KRUPA. that occasionally while
on hunting trips. with SAM MANNARINO they would stay in a hotel
in.a nearby town (possibly Waynesboro) instead of “Sleeping
over: night at the farm house.

 

Philadelphia through Recorder. of. Deeds: for. Franklin County,
Pas, attempt. to-identify the 200 acres of land and hunting’ '
lodge owned by SAM MANNARINO. The property is probably . . ;
recorded in MANNARINO's name, however, if county records ve ;
‘fail to disclose desired information check names of the ~

followingywho: in the past. have, been used as legitimate business ‘
fronts by MANNARINO:. : : '
