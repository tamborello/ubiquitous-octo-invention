MATTERS; IS-c", a foe .

Referenced New York letterhead memorandum
of 3/13/64, reported that indications were. that RUSTIN
would assume the position of Northern Coordinator of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference in the near
future. However, referenced letterhead of 3/18/64,
reported that indications were that RUSTIN would not
assume the position. It appears that RUSTIN is no longer
inverestcd but instead, desires a free lance arrangement
rather than to work for any specific organization. He went
so far as to state to CLEVELAND ROBINSON that he was not
interested in working for the SCLC or for anyone.

SCLC does not need anyone other that ADELE KANTER,

His statement was made during: a discussion of the RUSTIN

Coordinator of the SCLC, :

Atlanta has given sertous consideration previ ous lyf y i
to monitoring bank accounts of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. and
: Southern Christian Leadership Conference. It has not been, ,
ew done to date because security woulé be lacking under the AT i241
& = - circumstances. The only Atlanta accounts of KING and ix aac NA

It is believéd that other sources ean determine
whether BAYARD RUSTIN is actually working for Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, At the “present time it
appears that he is not on their payroll based on information
from confidential sources both in Atlanta and in New York.
Therefore, Atlanta will make no recommendations at this time
for the monitoring of the account of KING or Southern
Christian , peasgrship Conference.

payments on these notes and aS a consequence, he was currently

her from the SCLC payroll.

Reurairtel dated 6/23/66.

Approval not granted at this time to conduct
background investigation of Yernona Clayton with view toward
possible use of inicrmation daveloned to diseredit Martin Luther
Ring, dz. and/or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC).

Should Clayton be dismissed from her position with
the SCLC, you may resubmit sugrested counterintelligence action.

HOTEs Zernona Clayton is “office hostess” at SCDC headquarters

in Atianta. She has engaged in promiscuous relations_with.

Martin luther Eine ics, aid has also been reported to be a Lesbian.

Other officers of SCLC have recommended terminating Clayton's
employment due to the poor financial condition of SCLC, Mine is
opposing such action because of his personal relationship with

Clayton, aud also because King signed notes for Clayton in connectio
with her purchase of an expensive residence in Atlanta, Suggestion

by Atlanta that discreet backcround investigation of Clayton be

conducted iocking toward possible use of information developed to

discredit King and/or SCLC, not believed desirable at this time.

Should Clayton be dismissed from her job with the SCLC, considerat
could be given at that time to possible counterinteliligence action.
