NATALIE ROSS and to-DAVE FREED. He said he could not include
JOE LAWRENCE and his wife because they were not interested in
politics any more. ‘They seemed too busy making money; they
now run their own business.

JOR LANOIN suggested that they do what he in=
tended to do, mail some of the literature to leading. Dallas
figures. Such literature should be. distributed aw much'as
possible. He though they just had to. get it into the hands of
the public. Specifically to those wha. belonged | to civic and
political organizations. They: already kiiew where liberals and
axsPurty members stood, BYLL LOWERY and ESTRADA approved of
the idea and suggested that a meeting be devoted. to thé madl=
ing of literature to influential people. BILL LOWERY suggested
PAULIA WEAVER of the Young Democrats and ESTRADA suggested
the RAmeS of IDA HORERO of the GI Forum and Rev. RHETT JAMES ,

Informant "a repert further: reflected that BILL
LOWERY, concerned about the ‘fairly recent” newspaper reports |
on Texas communists’, said he believed where the leak was
“that members of the State Committee had given out that infor-
mation. That they seened ‘to be the only ones who knew enough ‘
about’ the Party apparatus to give such inforniation. They 7
(the newspapers) had named AUGUSTIN and had’. 4180 “named” JOBN ~

- STANFORD and bad given his: post: ‘in the Party. He said” nobody
else: knew what STANFORD’ s- ‘position was: LOWERY: recalled how

the newspaper had. prematurely stated that Dallas had six te
members when there were only five. JOE LANDIN said. he under-.
stood that BILL LOWERY had reeruited MC KINNEY from Ft. Worth
and. had asked him ta meet with the Dalias group. . He said ~~...
that if that were the case, only AUGUSTIN ESTRADA, BILL LOWERY
and ‘MC KINNEY knew about the sixth member. JOE LANDIN added
that BILL LOWERY had recently told him. how. nysterious ‘MC KINNEY
had. acted one time when BILL LOWERY and AUGUSTIN were supposed
to meet with him. BILL LOWERY sald he had not réeruited the
sixth member as he had! been’ told. by the State Committee,
therefore, the leak must be-in the State Committee. BILL
LOWERY suggested a trap to catch the informer by having :

According to {nformant , BILL LOWERY. and AUGUSTIN |
ESTRADA plan to meet some’ night that week and finish’ a report
on the Mexican-Aneritan question. LANDIN was asked by. AUGUSTIN
to make a report on Cube.

Informant had no’additional information.
