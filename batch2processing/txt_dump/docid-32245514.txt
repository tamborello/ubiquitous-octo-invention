the Castro government. Ayres was called in to

brief Artime on everything he knew. The meeting
allegedly took place at a VIP safehouse on a golf course
near Coral Gables. The briefing was interrupted by

two Cuban visitors and Artime escorted them to the
library. Ayres overheard an argument between the two
men regarding money that was supposed to be hidden on
the island. A pirate's lair on Point Mary is the point

where the money was supposedly hidden.

Turner spoke briefly regarding OSMIT MOODY, stating
that he used Howard Hughes money for the Triple A
@ group in the early 1960's as was the apparent owner

of the island on which money and arms were hidden.

. CARROLL JARNIGAN. A witness that Turner feels may
. merit another look. Jarnigan is a lawyer from Texas,
a graduate of SMU, a chess champion, "brilliant" accord-
in to Turner. -Jarnigan wrote a letter to the FBI after
the JFK assassination describing an event alleged to
have taken place on October 3, 1963 at Jack Ruby's club
where Jarnigan had taken a girlfriend, While they were
waiting to be seated, a homosexual arrived, wearing a
windbreaker and identified as Oswald. Jarnigan said
the man said he had just gotten in from New Orleans and
@ was overheard talking about Robert Kennedy. FBI dis-

missed the story although Jarnigan took a lie detector

test. They declared Jarnigan believed the "fanciful"
story. ‘Turner went to see Jarnigan and interviewed
him regarding these events. He found him to be

impressive and believable.

. RONNIE CAIRE. An interview in early 1967 revealed

that Caire had met ARCACHA in December of 1961 when

he came to Caire's office to raise money for the

Cuban Revolutionary Front. (CRC). This led to the

formation of the Crusade to Free Cuba. Those induced

to head up the drive were: GILL MELLIN, Vice President

of the Whitney Bank and CARLOS GRIMADER, an accountant
@ ; who kept records for. Cuban groups (i.e., CRC). The

money was used to finance many different things including

acquisition of PT boats, etc. The Crusade lasted 3

months, but was a failure. Caire says he lost $10,000

and Arcacha pocketed most of it.

Caire's office on the 7th floor of the Cigali Building
in 1964 (the corner office on Canal Street side)... After
the Crusade, Arcacha.worked for Caire (from 2/12/62 to
9/18/62). Then Arcacha went to Mexico around July or
August 1962, probably under an assumed name, with
NESTOR MARQUEZ-DIAZ, an attorney and economist from
Algiers, Louisiana and a teacher at Nicholl's College.
® Caire was impressed with the veracity and character of

CARLOS QUIROGA. Quiroga had warned Caire early.on in

. FRED LEE CRISMAN. Turner was interested in Crisman
because of his physical similarity to one of the tramps
and his association with the 01d Orthodox Church and
Thomas: Beckham, He found that Crisman had been living
with a retired Army Colonel named WHERE, who is involved
with. Wide World Advertising in Seattle, Washington. To
Turner, it seemed that Crisman was involved in an
intelligence operation. Jim Garrison received an.
anonymous letter during the course of his investigation
which pointed to Crisman and claimed that Crisman was
travelling between Seattle and New Orleans all the time.

(See Crisman portion of Turner file for copy of letter.)

@

It was further alleged (source unknown) that Crisman
carried a diplomatic passport that he claimed to have
received through a Congressional committee. He also
reportedly was connected with SERGIO ARCACHA SMITH.

He had been in the Air Force. Crisman died in 1975.
Beckham, with whom Crisman was connected, was a courier
for the anti-Castro groups and acquainted with David
Ferrie. MCNABB, a soldier of fortune who works with
Turner, has) notes on CRISMAN/WHITE. McNabb lives in

St. Helena, California.

. CARLOS HERNANDEZ. Turner believes that Hernandez is

most likely the person known as "A" from the Senate

later that afternoon.) According to a person who
Turner considers reliable, Ellison had received a phone
call immediately after Ruby shot Oswald with a message
to relay back to Belli. The call was apparently
from a Las Vegas lawyer, with whom Ellison was familiar,
trying to reach Belli. Belli was travelling so the
caller told Ellison that "one of our boys" has .gotten
involved in the case and they wanted Belli to handle
Ruby's defense and that Belli could net a million
dollars. The caller later called Ellison again to say

that it was not one of their men after all.

With respect to Belli, Turner also mentioned JUDY
DOWES. Dowes hired Belli to help her brother out of
a Mexican jail in 1968.° She was alleged to have been
heavily involved with the soldier-of-fortune types

in Miami.

. BRADING/BRADEN. Following the assassination, Turner
dida motor vehicle check to track down JIM BRADEN and
located him at an office in Beverly Hills. A colleague.
of Turner's, McNabb, went to the office to check it out
and found that he was receiving mail there. (This
information was turned over to Peter Noyes who sub-

@ sequently investigated the Braden connection rather
thoroughly. Braden is alleged to have been connected
with Los Angeles Police Department intelligence and IRS

intelligence. )

Some of the points are listed below.

Through FELIPE DE DIEGO, Turner was able to get

some information on Operation 40. De Diego had

gone to intelligence school at Fort Benning prior

to the Bay of Pigs. He has gained more recent
notoriety following his indictment in connection
with the Ellsberg break-in. He told Turner about
Operation 40, a spin-off group of the 2506 Brigade
which was to coordinate the political transition
after the removal of Castro in the invasion. Turner
stated that Operation 40 was the intelligence branch
of the 2506 Brigade and brougltalong assassins. since
it was believed that some of the Cuban leaders would

have to be eliminated permanently. Members of this

group included COLONEL PIEDRA, who was also said to

be in contact with CARLOS BRINGUIER, and JOAQUIN
SANJENIS, who reputedly was with the CIA and is
alleged by Frank Sturgis to be his (Sturgis") CIA
contact officer. E. HOWARD HUNT is also supposed to

have been in charge of this group.

In connection with our interest in determining whether
ONI would have any significant information pertinent
to the investigation, we inquired about LUIS BALBUENA,

a Cuban said to have been an ONI consultant at Guantanamo

DocId:32245514 Page 5

Page 4

Base. Turner believes Balbuena sat on the council
of anti-Castro Cubans at Guantanamo (along with
ALBERTO "EDDY" BAYO, among others) and that the
naval contingent there must have been somewhat
knowledgeable of the CIA activities that were then
taking place. He specifically mentioned JACK
MODDESSETTE, the coordination officer of ONI at
Guantanamo as the person most likely to be helpful.
Moddessette is now in Texas. Turner said Bernard
Fensterwald is the person who connected Moddessette
with ONT. ‘Turner also believes ONI was involved or
knowledgeable about the CIA training camp at the

ola Algiers ammo dump near New Orleans. (The CIA
has: denied that there were any CIA-sponsored camps
in Louisiana although. one of the CIAts own .documents,
a debriefing interview with Grayston Lynch, reveals
that the Old Algiers camp was indeed backed by the ~
CIA. This document was reviewed by Team 3 members
at the CIA). ONI involvement in this camp should be
checked out. BERNARD BARKER would also probably be
helpful in substantiating ONI involvement, according

to Turner,

SEYMOUR "Sy" ELLISON, Melvin Belli's former law partner,

‘was also mentioned by: Turner (which complemented the

Melvin Belli interview John Hornbeck had with Belli

SUBJECT: Trip Report

 

DATE: January 25, 1978

On Thursday, December 22, 1977, John Hornbeck, Patricia
Orr, and Betsy Palmer travelled to the home of William
Turner in San Rafael, California to interview Mr. Turner
and review his files which he has-.accumulated. in connection
with a book he is writing on the assassination of President
Kennedy.

Turner isa former FBI agent and has written numerous
articles in the past fifteen years about the assassination
-and activities of exiled Cubans. Section A of this report
contains a sampling of such articles compiled for us by
the staff of the Library of Congress.

Turner's manuscript, The Cuba Project, deals extensively &
with Oswald in New Orléans, the activities centered around
544 Camp Street.in New Orleans, and Oswald's connection
with Cubans. He is also working on an area involving Jack
Ruby and his possible connection with organized crime. A
chapter-by-chapter summary of the manuscript is contained
in Section B.

_Turner is conversant on several issues involving
organized crime and anti-Castro Cubans because of his work on the

@ book and his investigative efforts over the years on the Kennedy
o .

case. He was somewhat reluctant to turn over all portions
of his manuscript for xeroxing for the Committee, expressing
concern that his materials might be misused (i.e., leaked)
before the book is published. However, we were able to
obtain copies of substantial portions of the book and gave
him-.our assurance that all of his material would be kept in
security safes at this office. Turner also promised to send
copies of his working drafts on chapters relating to Manuel
Artime, the MRR.and Operation MONGOOSE.

In addition to the manuscript, we brought back notes

r on the following subjects:

The Bayo-Pawley Affair

Interview notes, Robert K. Brown, re: Abaco Island

'-Suecession

Martin F. X. Casey Interview
