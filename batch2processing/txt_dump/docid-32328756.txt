fellow there. Apout a month ago. And
I know we don't like this guy so I spoke: to
VITO and told him I might have to make a trip.
He said whenever you're ready. I didn't
want to make it too soon. Because then a
lot of time lapses... I'd rather make it
as close as possible. So that's. about

FERRARO: OK GEORGIE.

It is noted that FERRARO referred to SAVARESE as
GEORGIE, however, GEORGIE is ain-all probability a common

exists that this may be VITO GENOVESE, New York top hoodlum.
