x Re Havana letter to the Bureau dated October 12, 1959.
“a : /
ma of HAV-33, who maintains constant contact with the casinos
ra in Havana, has advised on several occasions that the gambling

pusiness is very poor due to the lack of tourist trade. The
large ASTA (American Society of Travel Agents) convention: which
was in session in Havana on October 21, 1959, when the alleged '
"bombing" of Havana took place by, planes based in the United States,
was expected to greatly increase the tourist trade; however,
following the alleged "bombing" Prime Minister FIDEL CASTRO

lashed out in very bitter attacks on the United States and a

very negative impression was created on a majority of the ASTA -
delegates present in Cuba. -

It has been observed by SA Edwin L. Sweet on several
occasions that there are practically no hotel guests and no
American players present in the gambling casinos of the Hotels ae
Capri, Hilton, Nacional and Rivéera. HAV-33 has eported that }fl&
_ gambaing business is also very poor at the Hotel gomodoro_and ° oa

week-end of November 21, 1959, that the Hotéd{ Riviera was inter-
vened by the Cuban Revolutionary Government. t Was known and é

loss and the Cuban Government refused to allow the hotel to releas

entertainment offered at the hotel. : \

HAV-31 stated there is a “big fellow" with a mustache whose
first name is MARK (LNU) who formerly operated at the casino in the -
St. Johns Hotel who is now reported to be handling a deal for the
opening of a large gambling casino tin Puerto Rico. HAV-31 believes y,5
MARK is handling this deal for MIKE, HCEANEY or at least MIKE McLANEY.—~———
is fronting for the operation, HAV31 could furnish no concrete Cube
information as to the identity of the owners at the Hotel Nacional —---—~
casino but stated he believed a "big time" operator in New York .
actually is the owner of the casino and nay be the money behind the |
setup in Puerto Rico. This source ‘did not believe the casino in
Puerto Rico would be ready for operation before October, 1960.

On November 21, 1959, PCI Arthur Newman advised there is a
night club with a capacity for about 1200 people near the Hilton Hotel
in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and he understood that MIKE McLANEY is
fronting for the establishment of a gambling casino there. . This
: source thought the casino might be in operation shortly after the
Christmas holidays in order.to take advantage of some of the present

winter tourist trade. . .

November 5, 1959, PCI Alberto Suarez Aleman reported '
that SAN RAFFICANTE was departing the following day for. Tampa, l
Florida, for the alleged purpose of tending to some business and \
“prifiging his wife back to Cuba; however, on November 23, 1959, source
advised that TRAFFICANTE apparently had some difficulty over a tax
deal at Tampa and he had still not returned.

On November 25, 1959, HAV-33 reported that TRAFFICANTE had
gone to Tampa and had been involved in some difficulty regarding his |
taxes. HAV-33 also reported that as of November 23, 1959, JACK . |
LANSKY continues to be out of Cuba and informant believed he was
making some final financial arrangements withhis brother, MEYER LANSKY,
concerning their business at the Hgtel Riviera and the gambling casino J
which has been intervened by the Cuban Government.

HAV-33 concauded that on November 23, 1959, he ascertained
that the Hotel Capri has 40 guests and a visit to the casino on that
night reflected no players in the casino. .

 

Extra copies of this Letter have been prepared for forwarding
by the Bureau to the New York, Miami and San Juan offices. :

;
é

The activities of American gamblers operating in Havana will
continue to be followed and if any of the important gambling casinos
are closed, the same will be promptly reported to the Bureau.
