Re: EXPLOSION IN ENGINE ROOM |
OF BRITISH FREIGHTER “GRANWOOD”

 

On May 20, 1968, Lieutenant Commander D. F. Smith,
U. S. Coast Guard, Mobile, Alabama, advised that he examined
the damage to the "Granwood” which was then dry-docked
‘at Mobile, Alabama. Commander Smith advised that the damage
appeared to be caused by an explosion from outside the
ship near a grate through which water was being pumped \
to cool the engines, He stated that the explosion was
definitely from outside the ship and was of such force to
raise the deck of the engine room approximately four inches,

 

The "Miami. News” of June 1, 1968, carried an
article which stated, "Cuban Power, an exile terrorist
organization based in Miami, claimed today it was responsible
for bombing a Japanese freighter yesterday ata Tampa dock,

; and a British ship off Key West.

“A spokesman identified only as Ernesto, added
that ‘other ships are going to explode.’ He said Cuban. .
Power is warring against trade with Cuba,” , ;

The basis for this article was a telephone’ call
received by the Associated Press at Miami, Florida, from.
an individual who identified himself only as "Ernesto of:
Cuban Power."

in connection with this matter and investigation is con-
_tinuing by this organization in an effort to attempt to
identify any suspects in connection with this bombing and
to determine the validity of the claim by "Cuban Power" at
Miami that it was responsible for the bombing.
