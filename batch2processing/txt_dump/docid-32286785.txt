While in. Miami, SAM will usually stay at the .
Fountainbleau Hotel. [7] said he once saw SAM giving .
money to DUKE STEWART (ph), who is some sort of a manager at OTHER 4
the Fountainbleau. This was a secret kind of gift as SAM was
giving it to STEWART in the basement of the Fountainbleau. He
also visits Sonkens and Puccinis in Miami, Another favorite
spot in Miami is Capras Restaurant on Biscayne Boulevard.

As. a matter of fact, VINCENT CAPRA, on one occasions, while
SINATRA and GIANCANA were at the Fountainbleau, cooked a
number of meals for them and brought them from his

regtaurant to the Fountainbleau for them.

Concerning Las Vegas,[-_______]stated that at
one time he mentioned to PHYLLIS that it appeared that Jews
had the upper hand in Las Vegas. PHYLLIS stated that this is
not true, it’ just appears the Jews run things, that in reality,
the Italians. run it and put the Jews up as 4 front. (1)

SAM also supposedly owns the Cal-Neva. The Riviera
in Las Vegas, according to PHYLLIS, is also controlled by the
criminal element. () ;

On one occasion, PHYLLIS did state: that due to
the pressure from Fedral authorities, it is difficult for
the "members of the mob" to. meet and she. related that
sometimes they rent a hearse and meet in the hearse. U)

Cc] stated he himself is going to leave ‘
NYC and return to Calgary on either 5/25 or 26/63. He stated '
he will recontact the agents when he returns to NYC. ‘He will |
. y Check his telephone pill to determine if GIANCANA made any
calls from Calgary and if so, will furnish the numbers to-the

_ agentSe (wD
: In view of the above, as considered a PCI
and a case was opened in the NYOQo (WL

NY 92-793. : J

up with SAM as he can see no advantage to the MC GUIRE trio
to have PHYLLIS going with SAM. -He stated SAM is no good
for the MC GUIRES. (u)

He stated PHYLLIS met SAM about three years ago
in Las Vegas when she was-very “down in the dumps" as she
needed $28,000 very badly. At this time she started running
with SAM and he stated now PHYLLIS appears to be "power crazy''
and knows the only way for power is to have money. He said
SAM does give her money, but he does not know how much.
Likewise, SAM also gives her presents, but he does not know |
the value of these presents. (iL) '

He said SAM GIANCANA is trying to break up the |
trio. He keeps. making sly remarks of their act with his
purpose being to get PHYLLIS to do a solo. -He tells PHYLLIS
that he can make her a big movie star by herself if she will
only leave the trio. MURRAY KANE is the manager of the MC GUIRES
and has been for many years. The MC GUIRES make about $600,000
per year and this means about $58,000 per year for MURRAY KANE.
He feels sure that MURRAY KANE would be most happy to have GIANCANA
out of the picture. /)

Concerning the recent travels of -GIANCANA, cc OTHER 4
stated that the MC GUIRE sisters appeared at the Cave in Van Couver,
British Columbia, in the end of April, 1963, following which they
came to WILLIAMSON's home in Calgary, Canada. GIANCANA accompanied
PHYLLIS there.. They stayed three or four days when PHYLLIS and
SAM: went to Las Vegas and Palm Springs, Califorrfiia. . SAM had
obtained a part in FRANK SINATRA's movie ''C ow Your Horn" for Hf i}
PHYLLIS. SAM then went. to Hawaii_with ATRA and PHYLLIS. - eo
went.on to Pittsburgh. SINATRA is reportedly having trouble with
the Internal Revenue Service, not béing, able to show. how he earned,
all the money he is spending. LUCILLEXBALL (actress) is supposed
to have introduced SINATRA to a very wealthy widow, name unknown,
from Hawaii and SINATRA is considering marrying her to account
for the money he is spending. w .

| PHYLLIS did not know GIANCANA was going to Hawaii
and became furious with him and called him and he then joined
| the MC GUIRE sisters in Pittsburgh. From Pittsburgh, they all
came to NYC arriving on Sunday, 5/19/63. GIANCANA stayed ‘at
PHYLLIS' apartment, 525 Park Avenue, Manhattan. ((/))

. He stated GIANCANA left NY either Monday or Tuesday,
returning to Chicago. (\L

Concerning VIC COLLINS, (said he is a OTHER 4
Canadian citizen now applying for a-work permit in the United States.
COLLINS used to work with in Calgary and a
good worker while as present, but when
left, did not do anything. therefore, fired
COLLINS although there are no hard feelings between them and
COLLINS went to the sisters and got a job as a general handy
man for them; “He is presently staying at the Madison Hotel,
NYC, and is the one who got the ticket for SAM GIANCANA to
fly to Chicago either Monday or Tuesday. ( 1/)) .

    
 
 

Concerning his knowledge of GIANCANA, he said
GIANCANA does have a one-suiter suitcase which he takes with him
on his travels. SAM usually carries quite a large sum of money.
He has never seen SAM obtainingmoney from people in the various
cities they have visited. (U. ’ >

 

He stated GIANCANA likes Italian food and while
in NY, will usually visit the Chambord Restaurant, the La Scala,
the 21 Club or El Morocco. He stated SAM usually stays at
PHYLLIS' apartment in NYC, although he has heard of him staying
at the Waldorf-Astoria and also the Madison Hotel. (( \ .
