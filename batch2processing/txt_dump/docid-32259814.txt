Re: Article on Orlando Bosch in New Times by Blake Fleetwood.
6 hr. interview with Bosch. Traces Bosch's involvement in anti-
Castro terrorism.

Claimed he and Luis Posado (sic) among 6,000 Cuban exiles on CIA
payroll. Felt betrayed by Kennedy administration and CIA after

Cuban Missile crisis and subsequent USG reduction in anti-Castro
activities.

Went underground after Jose. Elias de la Torriente assass. which
he praised but on which he disclaimed responsibility and began

to direct the "internationalization of the war." Felt terrorists
should operate from Central and S. Amer. bases, his So
goal being to forge alliances with friendly govts. of Nicaragua,
D.R., C.R., Venezuela

Luis Posada
Sec. 6 Serials

Made gov. agreements starting '74, promising no more terrorist
acts in Venezuela if no WCL officials of Cuban regime allowed
in Venez.

Later made contacts in Chile with Right-Wing AA party and con-
spired to kill 2 Cuban diplomats who disappeared 8/9/76 and
haven't been heard of since.

Carlos Rivero Collade, former Cuban exile, claims Bosch trained
by Chilean National Intelligence Dep.

Bosch refused to take personal credit for bombing within US
because of FBI "heat" but boasted that CORU - coordination

of United Revolutionary organization had been responsible for
over 50 in Miami, NY, Venezuela, Panama, Mex, Argentina

‘76 - New Deal - assumed name, lived in Venezuela; could organize
terrorist alts for anywhere except Venezuela, ER, DR.

Things going well until Letelier murder... set up by Ricardo Govales
Navarette.

Fleetwood claims Cuban govt. claimed Arile hired Bosch to kill
Letelier and Bosch handed CORU money for assassination. His
group didn't assassinate; wouldn't say who did. Fleetwood says
conf. report. Bosch said at arrest that “Novo brothers were in-
volved."
