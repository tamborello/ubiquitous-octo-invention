A great deal of potential has been demonstrated by this informant
and information received on a daily basis is being utilized
continually by those Agents assigned to the Criminal Intelligence
. Program in the Pittsburgh Office. Financial developments relating
to the North Star Cement Block Company assume prime importance
when it is realized that LA ROCCA has been designated as the prime
target subject of an intensification program looking toward early
prosecution on any Federal violation. LA ROCCA and the Supervisory
employees of North Star have spoken freely enough for this informant
to ascertain their reactions to investigations being conducted by i

both the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI at Pittsburgh. (See
