. Review of Albany indices concerning names set
forth in referenced communications failed to develop any
positive information with the exception of LCN reports
prepared by the New York Office, which contain references
to CLYDE GEORGE SMALDONE, CLARENCE M. SMALDONE, EUGENE
SMALDONE and PAUL CLYDE VILLANO, all of whom are known or
suspected LCN members within the Denver Division. It is
noted that this same information was disseminated to both
Miami and Denver.

Albany TE member sources have been repeatedly i)
contacted regarding captioned matter and AL 3983-C-TE has

advised that RUSSELL A. BUFALINO (BUFALINO LCN Family) knew
the deceased victim very well. Source was unaware of details
of BUFALINO and ROSELLI's relationship, other than both are
LCN members. Source advised that the only reference to
ROSELLI's death was that of ANTHONY FRANK GUARNIERI (BUFALINO
LCN Caporegima), who commented that ROSELLI "probably went

to far," a reference which source assumes was made to ROSELLI's
having testified before the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence (SSCI).
