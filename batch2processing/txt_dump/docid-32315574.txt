- Informant advised that he was in company with JOE
VALENTI the previous weekend. He said that VALENTI was real
upset and was telling him that somebody "high up" in the™
syndicate was “doing a lot of talking” to the FBI. Informant
said that VALENTI told him of his interview the previous
Friday, 3/1/63, by the FBI. .He said that VALENTI told him
that the FBI had his car "bugged! apparently because "they knew
“all about him." Informant stated that VALENTI told him that the
FBI knew about his going to the Palm Furniture Co. and of his
contacts with SAMMY GIORDANO, Informant said that actually
VALENTI was never "tight" with SAMMY G,.and, in fact, VALENTI
hates GIORDANO, He added that VALENTI has been close to him
for years, however, he cannot. be sure if VALENTI knows JOBNNY
“AYOTTE or not. on
Informant advised that VALENTI told him that theFBI
showed him a $50.00 check from Palm Furniture Co. which'was |
endorsed by "JOE VARGA" but which had VALENTI's. true address
and telephone number of 12779 Evanston, LA 7-6173 and also
_VALENTI's previous Michigan auto license number GG 4261.
Informant stated that VALENTI admitted to him that he had
actually endorsed this check as “JOE VARGA" and that "JOE VARGA"
was the alias given to him by SAMMY 'G, during the two week .
period during June, 1960, in which he (VALENTI) had worked as t
a salesman at Palm Furniture. Informant said that VALENTI told
him that the check wasn't phony but that he had certainly made |
a mistake in putting down his own address, phone number and !
car license number. Informant added that VALENTI also told him
SAMMY G,. had used him-as a "front" for two weeks and had paid :
. him a salary of $100.00 a week. He stated that VALENTI seemed :
oO very relieved that he only worked at Palm Furniture two weeks
and VALENTI commented that he was thankful that the one order ;
he signed for at Palm Furmiture under the mame "JOE VARGA" was i
actually one of the orders which was paid for.

 

Informant advised that VALENTI commented that the
Palm Furniture check he signed, using the mame "JOE VARGA", was-
a check proffered to him by SAMMY GIORDANO one day while work-
ing in the store. VALENTI told him that it wasn't a salary
check and he cashed it only because GIORDANO needed some
cash. Informant said that VALENTI told him that he knew the
check was good so he gave GIORDANO the $50,00 cash. He advised ;
that VALENTI complained to him that when he went to cash the
Palm Furniture check at the Clark Gas Station the guy asked him
for all kinds ef identification and he confusedly gave the name j
"JOE VARGA" even though the check was made out to "cash" plus |
all his own identifying data. Imformant said that VALENTI told

,

him that he only went to work at Palm as he thought he could
make some money but, as it turned out, he “didn’t eat or
, drink", ie, make any money from the deal.

Informant advised that VALENTI told him that following
his interview the previous Friday by the FBI he had contacted
JOE "WHIP" TRIGLIA and gave "JOE WHIP" all the details of the |
interview. VALENTI told Informant that he asked TRIGLIA to get ~
in touch with RUBINO right away and find out what RUBINO wants
him (VALENTI) to do cr say in the whole matter.

On 3/11/63, Informant advised that VALENTI told him
that TRIGLIA had contacted him and gave him a message from MIKE
RUBINO to the effect "Don't bother me. [I've got troubles of my
own", Informant commented that VALENTI is now real hot at
RUBINO. He said that really RUBINO made a big mistake in
answering VALENTI's request like this as VALENTI's testimony
could help "buyy RUBINO". Informant commented that he does
not believe that VALENTI actually knows RUBINO, He said that
certainly VALENTI has seen RUBINO a few times around town but
that VALENTI, when he was associated with “the people" was
employed in the numbers in the old Murphy House, which is now
run by "FAT DOMINIC" CORRADO and TONY GIACALONE, and VALENTI
wouldn't have come in contact with RUBINO, who represented another
faction in the syndicate. He said that he knows that VALENTI
knows SAMMY G. but that VALENTI displays nothing but. contempt
now for GIORDANO,

Informant advised that VALENTI has been ranting and
raving about “the people” having no. sense of loyalty or morals.
Informant added that sot only does VALENTI realize this now
put he is still afraid of them. He offered that VALENTI is not *
afraid of,say, MIKE RUBINO or TONY GIACALONE, as a person but
because they represent a strong organization = the syndicate.
Informant remarked that VALENTI had been employed_as a
“pick-up man" and an office worker in the numbers for TONY
GIACALONE but that VALENTI and GIACALONE got in "a big beef"
one day and GIACALONE fired VALENTI., Informant said that
VALENTI missed a "pick-up" one day at a particularly large
"drop" and it caused a lot of confusion and the loss of “a
day’s business". Informant stated that VALENTI complained that
he "made a tail" and thus wasn't able to make the "stop". He
added that the two of them apparently got in a big hassle over
it and the upshot was that VALENTI lost his job. Informant ad-
vised that VALENTI is still "pretty hot" at GIACALONE over this

5 whole incident.
