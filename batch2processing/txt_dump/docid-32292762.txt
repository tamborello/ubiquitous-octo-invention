this matter drop and desires that FIO RITO make a determined {
stand in this matter and fight the investigation being \

not want to "lose face" in this situation and cannot afford

Mayor DALEY advised FIO RITO that he had two alternatives.

He told FIO RITO that FIO RITO could get up on the floor of
the City Council and take an oath that he had properly and
jegitimately met all residence requirements. DALEY specified,
however, that in the event FIO RITO did this, he wovld also
have to testify in a civil suit which would undoubtedly be
brought by Republican Alderman JOHN HOELLEN, who has introduced
a resolution that FIO RITO's residence be investigated, and
that not only FIO RITO but also his wife would be required to
testify in such action under pain of perjury. DALEY advised
FIO RITO at the meeting of April 29 that if FIO RITO felt

that his position was strong enough so that he would commit
himself and his wife to such action, he, Mayor DALEY, would
then back FIO RITO. However, if he refused to take an oath
as to his residence, then Mayor DALEY suggested to FIO RITO
that the other alternative would be to resign.

CG 6498-PC advised that he spent most of the morning
with FIO RITO on 4/30/63. FIO RITO advised him that he
had recently returned from Florida, where his wife and children
are now residing, and discussed the propémis of Mayor DALEY
with his wife. FIO RITO strongly indicated to the PCI
that he would not desire to put himself or his wife in the
position of taking oath and testifying as to his residence.
PCI advised that he feels that FIO RITO will resign in the
very near future,

Based on the above information, contacts were made
this date at the lst Ward Organization, at FIO RITO's law
office, and at the Conrad Hilton Hotel, where he is residing
in attempts to contact him. These attempts were negative,
and messages were left for him to contact either SA-ROEMERopr
SA RUTLAND, Within ten minutes following these calls,

CG 6498-PC contacted SA ROEMER and advised that he had just
been contacted, and informed that the FBI was attempting to
contact FIO RITO,

‘So#®G@ advised that he will set up a meeting between

the FBI and FIO RITO as previously proposed and that he will
attempt to make this meeting for the morning of 5/1/63.
