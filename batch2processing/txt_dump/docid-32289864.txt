: . Concerning say/fe Stefano, 1656 North Sayre, Chicago,
Illinois, information Ontidentially recéived during April,

960, that De Stefano has a proclivity for setting fires in fits
of rage over incidents which he considers personal insults or as
a method of disiplining recalcitrant associates or customers. who
are delinquent in payments of "juice loans". In.1960, De Stefano
threw a naptha bomb in a bedroom window of the home of Chicago
Attorney Robert Mc Donnell which caused a fire resulting in
considerable damage. De Stefano did this as a result of the fact
that Mc Donnell was delinquent in payments on a "juice loan"
which he hdd made of De Stefano. . .

De. Stefano has been suspected of many crimes of murder,
assault with a deadly weapon, and similar type crimes by the
Chicago Police Department. He is regarded as the leading "juice
man" in this area in that he lends out vast sums at exorbitant
and usurious rates of interest. He is also believed to finance
burglars and thieves in turn for a percentage of their scores.

It has been reported that De Stefano is emotionally -
unstable and most excitable. Many occurrances which would not
disturb a normal person are said to put De Stefano into fits of
rage during which time he is liable to committ crimes of violance

far outweighing the reason for his anger. oe" PK Ret 6
