The Bureau and CG are referred to NY letter to
Bureau, 11/29/68, no copies to other offices, On 11/20/68,. i
NY 4047-S* advised that SUSAN FRANK told ToM WODETZKI, 422 :
W. 126th St., she had received his letter inquiring whether :
she would be interested in teaching at a new school, which
would be in the nature of the Free University. WODETZKI
informed FRANK he had obtained her name from SHARON KREBS.

' FRANK stated she would not be available until the end of
January, 1969, that China is her field and that she had | .
taught a course on the thoughts of MAO at the Free University.
WODETZKI wanted her to teach a similar five week course.

Should SUE FRANK undertake to teach such a course
~~for WODETZKI, it would present s.to this en for identifyin

pro-Chicom students in her class. ¥To this end, the NYO .
suggests a two-part program: first, to contagh WODETZKI
and learn if FRANK will be teaching; second }' to enable

NY 1656-S to attend FRANK's class, report on ner speeches . od
and identify class members who display pro-Chicom sympathies Pre)

More specifically, as relates to e first part of
this program, it is recommended that cG [6032 » before

CG informants would be under the impression the

Bulletin readers in NYC are on the N mailing list, the
actual number of readers to whom the notice of the class
is sent can be limited without CG. informants knowing, to
‘notify only- those readers about whom NY hopes to gather
current data through the efforts of NY 1656-S.
