IV. CRIMINAL AND RELATED ACTIVITIES

MI T-7 advised on 1/5/68 that shortly before Christmas, 1967,

he was approached by FRANK PETER BALISTRIERI, boss of Milwaukee

LCN family, STEVE DE SALVO and PAUL BOGOSIAN, during the

afternoon at Gallagher's Restaurant. BALISTRIERI asked him

if he had ever considered running for the position of

alderman ‘in the first ward of downtown Milwaukee. BALISTRIERI
- explained that all informant would have to do would be to

establish a residence in the downtown Milwaukee area for bo

approximately 10 days and he would be eligible to file nomination aa

papérs for the position of alderman. BALISTRIERI told informant t

he would pay for an apartment to be used by informant as a :

temporary residence and that he would also finance any

campaign expenses incurred by informant in running for .

alderman, In addition, if informant were elected, BALISTRIERI f

would continue informant's present salary and would allow

him to keep his alderman's salary as well. Informant told

BALISTRIERI he would decline the offer as he was running

for political office in the Village of Cudahy. Informant

noted BALISTRIERI was not happy with his refusal to accept

his office and has been very cold to him since that time.

During October, 1967, MI T-1 furnished information that
AUGIE COLLURA, local Italian punk hoodlum, had spoken to
him about arranging a meeting between FRANK BALISTRIERI and
former Milwaukee police Captain GEORGE SPRAGUE (NA), for
the purpose of determining if BALISTRIERI had connections
to put in a good word for SPRAGUE for consideration as
chief of police in Chicago Heights, Ill.

The 12/12/67 issue of the Milwaukee Journal newspaper
contained an article reflecting SPRAGUE had been appointed
as chief of police in Chicago Heights, I1l1. Mi T-1 advised

they purchased a 2-story square motel or hotel. Plans have
already been drawn for an extensive multi-story round
addition to this building which will be placed in the
center of the building. The first floor of the building
also will be enlarged for gambling purposes. BALISTRIERI
has allegedly approached FRANK LEO SANSONE, local Milwaukee
bookmaker, with a proposition that SANSONE go to Reno, Nev.,
to work for him and manage the gambling in this new
establishment.

MI T-8 advised on 6/6/68 that FRANK BALISTRIERI, Milwaukee
hoodlum, was in the Gaylur Mercantile Co. offices in

Chicago on 6/5/68 and was accompanied by the head of the
International Brotherhood Teamsters Union in Milwaukee,

The purpose of this visit was to see ALLEN DORFMAN; however,
DORFMAN stood them up and so they stopped by to see ALDERISIO.
After their departure, ALDERISIO commented to informant that
he really had "in" with these people and could get anything
he wanted from them.

MI' T-8 advised on 6/20/68 that PHIL ALDERISIO told him that
IRWIN WEINER had traveled to Milwaukee because ALDERISIO

has a big deal going on. ALDERISIO requested informant to
get in touch with contacts at the Belmont National Bank

and make arrangements for WEINER to open an account there
which would involve the depositing of approximately 8 million
dollars. The reason for setting this money up in an
account in Chicago is to insure that IRV WEINER receives

the commission to which he is entitled and by having the

bank as a distribution agent, he will insure receipt of

his commission. Informant speculated the money was

obtained through the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
in Milwaukee, pointing out that FRANK BALISTRIERI and the head
of the Teamsters Union had been in contact with ALDERISIO in
Chicago.

On 7/1/68 MI T-8 advised that the son of FRANK BALISTRIERI
from Milwaukee is an attorney and is drawing up the necessary
papers concerning an 8 million dollar loan being negotiated
by IRV WEINER, possibly with Teamster officials in

Milwaukee, Wis. According to informant, the money
forthcoming from this loan will be deposited and disbursed

' New York, in its airtel dated 5/16/66, set forth suggestions
for the uniform reporting in the membership section of
these reports. The suggestions have been followed, with
certain exceptions as follows:

The membership has been broken down alphabetically by family,
with the membership source being listed at the beginning
of the family listing. The best source for all membership
in Wisconsin is MI 623-C-TE. Multiple T symbols have been
“utilized to protect the identity of this informant, as he
identified LCN members in Chicago, Rockford, Iil., Kansas
City, and other parts of the country. It is believed
this informant's identity could reasonably be revealed if,
through dissemination of the master report, it was determined
the same, Milwaukee symbol number informant had identified ve
LCN members in Rockford, I11., as well as in Wis., as it Boe
is known in Milwaukee LCN circles that this informant - :
has relatives in Rockford and frequently visits then. .
To further protect the identity of this informant, no he
mention is being made that he is a member of the Milwaukee
LCN family.

 

~ INFORMANT INFORMATION NOT INCLUDED
IN DETAILS OF THE REPORT

 

The following information was not included in the details :
of this report to further protect the identity of MI 623-C-TE
and other Milwaukee informants, as this information was
obtained under circumstances which would easily compromise
the identity of these informants if the information should

be disseminated outside of the Bureau. .
