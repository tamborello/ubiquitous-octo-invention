which were: brought to light and HAZIDAKIS was convicted and
sentenced to serve several months in the Westmoreland County
Jail. ,

T-4 pointed out that HAZIDAKIS has a wife and teen-age. son
living in Athens, Greece, and that ‘HAZIDAKIS has told him.

on many occasions that he is.very proud of the son's scholastic
ability and the progress he is making in high school. T-4
stated that from conversations with HAZIDAKIS he believes

the son, in addition to attending high school in Athens, is
receiving private instructions from a tutor, and that the boy
is apparently possessed with a very high IQ.

at least a half million dollars in American money and would
actually like to return to.Athens, Greece, permanently if

it were not for KELLY MANNARINO and his influence over him.

family in Athens and {indicated ‘to him before he left that

he might stay in Greece permanently.’ T-4 stated that several
months later, after HAZINAKIS returned from Greece and [from
conversations with him, he gathered that KELLY MANNARINO
either ordered HAZINAKIS back to the United States or sent
someone over to Greece to bring him back, T-4 said that
HAZIDAKIS is actually terrified of KELLY “MANNARINO and in his
opinion only stays in the United States for fear of winding
up with,a bullet in his head if he refuses to follow KELLY
MANNARINO's orders. :

According to T-4, HAZIDAKIS is also afraid that he is dying
of cancer and has consulted many doctors. and visited
several of the major medical clinics in the United States
where. he has been assured that he-does not have cancer, but
he still continues to worry over the situation needlessly.

In regard to real estate holdings in Greece, p-4 stated

that he recently learned that the office building owned

by HAZIDAKIS is located in Perlas, Greece, rather than

Athens, and described the building as a large office -type
building, occupied for the most part by doctors and professional
men with the main floor of the building being leased out to
merchants.
