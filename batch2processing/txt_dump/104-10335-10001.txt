Mr. John Pereira

Director

Historical Review Group

Center for the Study of Intelligence

Dear John: ’

As you know, the ARRB Board at its May 19, 1995 meeting concluded that it required
additional specific information before it could review the CIA records under discussion
at this meeting. Based upon my discussions with you and with Barry Harrelson, I
understand that the Historical Review Group can respond only to questions that draw
upon information already on hand, and that any questions requiring further research
will go to the components for a response.

Since I understand from you and Barry that it will be faster if we divide those of our
questions directed to the Historical Review Group from those directed to the
components, we are submitting two separate lists for CLA’s response. List 1, which we
are submitting to the Historical Review Group, asks basic questions ebout documents,
including the Mexico chronology, which HKG has not previously addressed. List 2
asks for the answers to questions about names, pseudonyms, and crypts that go beyond
what we understand is HRG’s current available information.

Since the ARRB Board will consider these documents at its June 7, 1995 meeting, we
hope to have this information by then. Thank you for your continued cooperation, and

we look forward to your response. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Jeremy Gunn
for any clarification regarding these requests.

Sincerely yours,
David G. Marwell
Executive Director
