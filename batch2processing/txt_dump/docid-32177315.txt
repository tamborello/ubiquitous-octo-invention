Only the governor has pardoning powers under the
Tennessee constitution and Trammel said the. board
recommends ‘pardons only under, the most unusual cir-

. Ray’s petition said he had spent six of his more than-
"12 years in the Tennessee prison system in solitary con-
_ finement — three of those years as a result of “efforts by
"me then to gain trial in the MLK case.”

_The application notes that Ray had been disciplined
for a Nov. 3,.1975, attempted escape from the fortress-

-. like Brushy Mountain State Prison in east Tennessee.

“The reason for the attempt (sic) escape is that I
have been led to believe escaping is the only way Iwill be
released (sic) from prison, whether guilty or inn ent, ”
- Ray typed on the petition.

HORDESKY stated that he wished to furnish some
information to the concerning circumstances in which
he was involved at & time of the assassination of
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR

¢

HORDESKY advised that he was attending the
U.S. Coast Guard's Jet akd Propulsion Engine School in
Memphis, Tenn., during the time period involving the
assassination. He stated that he and another Coast
Guardsman, MICHAEL BUTLER, had @iven to the Y.W.C.A. in
Memphis, Tenn., where they were waiting for a couple of
girls. They were in HORDESKY's black, 1965 Chevelle, and
were listening to the radio. The news of the assassina-
tion came over the air and the girls came out to the
car, The news was also being broadcast on local tele-
vision. The broadcast stated that the police were look-
ing for a white Ford Mustang in connection with the
assassination. One of the girls mentioned that the
motel where the shooting had occurred was only about two
blocks away from their current location. At that point,
a white car, either-a Cougar or a Mustang, came down
the street and went past them. HORDESKY recalls that the
driver was a white male, in his late 20's or early 30's
and that the car was not brand new. HORDESKY stated that,
he really did not see the driver clearly and.does not
believe he would recognize him if he were to see him

again. HORDESKY stated that he was looking more at the
car than at the driver, but did not notice anything
unusual. The car was not speeding nor ‘was it being
driven erratically. He ‘and his friends only noticed it
because they had just heard the broadcast relating

to the white Mustang and were saying that they were glad
they had a black car so they would not be stopped.

HORDESKY stated that he had never thought about
this event as being significant, but in the light of the
current re-investigation of the assassination, he
decided to relate this to the FBI.
