SUBJECT: Coumendation. . : a

TO : Strategic Services Officer, OSS.

3. It 18 especially desired to commend the OSS units that were attached i
to or served in-conjunction with this headquerters and tacse Chinese Armies é
and groups whose operetions were ccerdinated through this teadquarters with ,
the Chinese Supreme Headsuarters.

2. The varied end unusual tyre of duty rerformed by these units =ade
their performance of duty most difficult. In scite of the telief of rany
foreigners, oased upon ordinary revs reports thet the Chinese were finished ~
guerilla fighters of long experiexce in such cperations against the Jepanese,
there was ectually little of this type of combat that had heen carried on .
effectively for the past tuo years. , . :

 

3. The arrival of ageressive and competent groups of officers, sany
with prior commando service in the Duropean Theater, provided a greet impetus
to the Chinese. These young officers, with little or no crior service in .
China, were eble to obtain the confidence of the Chinese entirely baseuse of
their nilitery efficiency and ability to teach and preduce results and to i
fight alongside of the Chinese in their units, The commando units overcane’ “
many difficulties ard produce¢ outstanding resuits during their service .
in China. ~ . ot et

 

 

   

H : 4 This hoadquerters has coordinated most of its work with these units
i ‘through Colonel William R. Peers, Colonel Willien P. Davis, ard Lt. Colonel
Alfred T. Cox. All three of these officers heve proven to te especially’ "
conpetent, cooperative, end cutstanding for cormon sense and judgment.
_ Because cf their effcrts, many cf the difficulties whieh are inherent in
: coordineting military cperations which are rezoved from the channel of

military command have never even arisene
