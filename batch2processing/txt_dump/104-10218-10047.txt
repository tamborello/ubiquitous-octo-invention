Reference: HWVS-6494

: -1. It js requested that the Operational Approval for
LINUFF-2 be cancelled. :

' 2. While the Station continues to receive copies of
LIHUFF-2 publications and reports through LIEUFF-1, the Station
no longer gives financial Support nor diréction to LIHUFF-2's
efforts. The Station receives a1] information from LINUFI'-2
indirectly through LINUFF-1; there is no direct contact. The
Station gives no direction or requirements to LINUFF-2, and
merely accepts what LIHUPF-1 passes on.

3. In view of the above, the Station feels there is no
need to retuin LIHUFF-2's OA. Subject is recommended for
recontact, but anyone contacting LINUFF-2 should be avare
that this asset is extremely biased and right-wing, and is in
dire need of financial backing for his pro-U.S. and pro-
private capital investment nagazine, :

Action Required; FYI

1. Attached is a book on revolutionary theory, "La Iglesia,
el Subdesarrollo y la Revolucion,” recently published by
"Editorial Nuestro Tiempo" (which often publishes pro-Communist
material), which was brought to the Station's attention by

_LIHUFF-1 on 22 October 1968.

2. With the exception of one of the ten authors who :
contributed to this book (Karl LENKERSDORF) all others subscribe,
in one way or another, to the developing thesis that Christian
(both Catholic and Protestant) theology justifies the use of
violence (i.e., killing if necessary) to bring about basic
structural changes in the "Third World." An undercurrent of
sympathy for revolutionary "martyrs" "Che" Guevara and Camilo
Torres permeates uost of the writings, as does the old favorite
shibboleth of Latin American "intellectuals" that the United
States has purposely kept Latin America underdeveloped {to
maintain a source of cheap raw materials and a market for

expensive manufactured goods).
