’ Re Los Angeles letters dated 12/14/67 and
12/28/67, captioned LA 4960-PC, TECIP (Bufile 137-
17525). ‘ : .

For the information of the Los Angeles
Office for use in subsequent contacts with LA 4960-
PC, it is to be noted that information furnished by
the informant with reference to Mafia activities in
the Detroit area during the early 1900's appears to
be accurate and fits in closely with infrmation
developed by the Detroit Office in connection with

_LCN investigations, 4
The brothers referred to by the informant Ja

on page four of Los Angeles letter dated 12/14/67 are
undoubtedly identical with the GIANNOLA brothers, who -
were notoriously known extortioners during the period
prior to the 1920's in Detroit. Ail of them were

evidently killed in gangland wars. . : \

   

Informant should be knowledgeable concerning ‘
the RUGGIERELLO brothers who were active in Flint,
Michigan, during the 1920's and 1930's, One of the
brothers (both are deceased) named TODDO, was a close
personal friend of JOE ZERILLI, who is leader of the
Detroit LCN family and who rose to power during the
1920's,

TODDO RUGGIERELLO had four sons, two of
whom are still active in the numbers business in the
Flint, Michigan, area.
