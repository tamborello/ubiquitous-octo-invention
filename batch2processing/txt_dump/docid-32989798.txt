RE: FILE 62-117290 PERTAINING TO THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
_ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

Pursuant to letters from Congressman Louis Stokes and
the Clerk of the House of Representatives, any material relating ~
to the work of the HSCA should not be released.

The FBI is currently in litigation with a requester for
all material provided to the HSCA concerning its investigation
into the assassination of President Kennedy. The House of Rep-
resentatives is joining the litigation in an attempt to claim
Congressional privilege for all of the material connected to
the HSCA investigation. This includes ‘all correspondence be-
tween the FBI and the HSCA, as well as internal FBI communica-
tions. The HSCA's position is that these materials, as well as
materials concerning its investigation of the assassination of
Martin. Luther King, are congressional documents and not agency
records and therefore, are excludable from release purstiant
to Title 5, United States Code, Section 552 (1) (A), 1976. (It
is noted that the HSCA investigation of the assassination of Martin
Luther King is not in litigation.)

Therefore, any material contained in Bufile 62-117290,
or duplicative documents whicl. may be unrecorded in other Bufiles
a should be denied. Should you have any questions concerning this,
please contact Willis Newton on extension 5767.

SUBJECT: PRESS MATTER
INQUIRY OF INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER
BILL FREYVOGEL .

On 11/9/78 captioned individual telephonically
contacted the Springf#éld Division. | FREYVOGEL, who repre-

— sented himself as a €eporter for St< Louis Post Dispatch
St. Louis, Missouri, ‘one =621-1111, extensidl ,
advised he was contacting FBI, Springfield, regarding an
article which he has allegedly been requested to write by
the Governor of the State of Missouri. According to FREYVOGEL,
he is doing research concerning ERNEST TURLEY, convicted jul
of bank robbery in 1970, regarding an alleged bank robbery~- a-
at Laddonia, Missouri. According to FREYVOGEL, TURLEY is d aoe
to be pardoned soon, possibly by the Governor of the State HA
of Missouri.

FREYVOGEL advised that he obtained information
from JAMES ROGERS and CLARENCE HAYNES, who purport to be
associates of JOHN LARRY RAY, brother to JAMES EARL RAY.
FREYVOGEL contends that information from ROGERS and HAYNES
indicates that TURLEY did not commit the Laddonia, Missouri

bank robbery. FREYVOGEL further indicated that he had infor-
mation that ROGERS, HAYNES and RAY were involved in the
Meredosia and Liberty bank robberies in 1969 or 1970, but
that no prosecution was ever instituted.

For information of St. Louis, SI file 91-4774
(destroyed) regarding the Farmers and Traders State Bank
of Meredosia, Illinois, was closed as a solved case. Further,
Springfield matter 91-4653 (destroyed), the Farmers State
Bank at Liberty, Illinois, was closed as a solved matter.
Both bank robberies occurred in 1969.

FREYVOGEL wanted information as to whether or not
ERNEST TURLEY was or waS not an associates of ROGERS, HAYNE
and RAY. Springfield indices indicate CLARENCE EDGAR HAYNE
apparently identical to individual mentioned by FREYVOGEL.
Springfield file 76-3675 (closed) reviewed and no information
