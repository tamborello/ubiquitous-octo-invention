‘ the Hotel Last FrontierCCorporation).

Examination of the "Emanuel Rothman, Trustee
Account" at the Union Bank, which account has been used in
the past by ROSSELLI's accountant, EMANUEL ROTHMAN, to handle
funds for ROSSELLI, reflected that during the month of
June, 1964, one deposit of $1,000 was made to the
account. On 6/1/64 a check for $615 was drawn payable
to Glen Tower Apartment. On 6/4/64 a check. for $2,500
was drawn payable to Hayden-Stone, Inc. (stockbrokers).

- On June 15, 1964, a check for $1,000 payable to JOHN
ROSSELLI was deposited to ROSSELLI's account at the
Fidelity Bank, Beverly Hills, California.

Information has been previously set out that |
in March, 1964, ROSSELLI deposited to the above account a
check for $5000 drawn on the account of INES CHAPMAN of
Beverly Hills, California, and that the check bore a
notation that it was for "2000 Pacific Vitamin."

On 7/2/64 information was obtained from Pacific
Vitamins, Inc., North Hollywood, California, that the stock
records of this company for September, 1963, reflect that
"JOHN ROSELLI," 1251 North Crescent Heights Boulevard, Los
Angeles, was then the owner of 2000 shares of stock in the
company. Mr. DAVID VICKTER, the owner of the company,
stated that the City National Bank, Beverly Hills, California,
act as transfer agents for this stock and would have a record
of any sale of this stock by ROSSELLI and the name of the
purchaser, VICKTER said that he did not know that ROSSELLI
owna? the 2000 shares. He said that he knows ROSSELLI
through association at the Friars Club, but is not closely
acquainted with him. He said he has had no business ventures
with ROSSELLI and added that he does not know where ROSSELLT
gets his money as he apparently does not have any employment.
‘ He then added that ROSSELLI must have some interests in Las
Vegas, but he, VICKTER, has no knowledge of what these
interests might be. .
