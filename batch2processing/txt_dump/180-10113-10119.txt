MEXICO CITY -- CIA
Personnel:

From..other sources, namely, through information garnered
by our own investigation, we are also aware of others
involved with CIA Mexico City Station.in 1963.

Mr. and Mrs. Boris Tarasoff:
As one of the CIA's husband-and-wife teams, the
Tarasoff's, had the job of translating and transcribing
conversations in the Russian language going in
and out of the Soviet Embassy by telephone.

They were experts in voice identification using such
aids as newspaper clippings and other miscellaneous
informations about different individuals to help
determine geographic origins, etc. about persons
whose conversations were being tapped.

The Tarasoffs were directly involed in the translation
and transcription of the Oswald conversation, although
the specifics have become dim in Mr. Tarasoff's
memory.

 

Tarasoff succeeded

 

 

 

Tarasoff was never questioned by any investigative
agency about the Oswald conversations.

Boris Tarasoff thought the conversation was most
likely between Kanstaninov and Oswald and did not
involve Kostikov or Yatskov. Tarasoff knew no one
by the name of Kostin.

Tarasofft presently resides inf. t~—“CCCCST TJ

Tdentified by Tarasoff as CIA "contact" between

the station and the translators. ..It is not clear
whether Tarasoff was in the station or in a separate
intercepting unit, but it appears that he was
pwobably outside the station.

 

 

 

seemed especially interested when the second
Cail between Oswald and the Soviet Embassy was
intercepted and Oswald identified.

Robert Zambernardi:
Identified by Tarasoff as the photographic expert
at the Mexico City station. at..least from September
1963 to November 1963.

TO: JH, KK 93362
FROM: PMO

RE: CIA Station in Mexico City

Attached find a list of individuals known to have been
connected with the CIA station in Mexico City during

Lee Harvey Oswald's visit. ‘ -

This information has been gleaned mainly from the
executive session testimony of David Phillips, ex-CIA
agent who had been in charge of Cuban Affairs for the
CIA in Mexico City. Other information comes from staff
interviews with a witness, Boris Tarasoff, formerly

with the intercept unit of the CIA station.

It has been suggested that E. Howard Hunt may have been
involved in CIA activities in Mexico City and specifically

with the visit of Lee Harvey Oswald. Many critics

 

 

 

 

"_possibly_held that position. This, however, would;

 

conflict with information from Phillips that the Station

Chief was named -Winston Scott, now deceased.

This does not preclude the possibility that Hunt held

MEXICO CITY ~- CIA

A review of notes taken from interviews with David
Phillips indicates that there are a several areas
which our witness may be questioned about.

Organization & Personnel
Personnel in Mexico City Station:

David Phillips:
In 1963 Phillips was in charge of Cuban affairs
for the CIA in Mexico City. As such, he was
responsible for the monitoring of the Cuban
Embassy.

He was in Mexico City from September 1961
to early 1965, succeeding Tom Hazlett.

He originally comes from Ft. Worth and joined the
CIA in 1950.

Winston Scott:
Station Chief for the Mexico City CIA Station in 1963.
Supervisor for Phillips in practice, although the
deputy Chief of Station would normally have been
the person to whom Phillips was to report.

Scott was known for his almost photographic memory
and a strong personality. He did not like to delegate
authority.

Scott was the person who made final determination

as to whether information coming in over an

intercept was to be forwarded to Washington or not.

 

Scott is now deceased. He died of a heart attack
around 1972. His name was not previously known publicly.
