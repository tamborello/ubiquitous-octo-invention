i Inquiry at-the Office of the Federal Attorney

i General, Hexico, D. F., developed information to the effect

; that all investigation in this case was conducted by the

i osecutive and judicial authorities at Morelia, Michoacan,
[in view of the fact that investigative informants of this
office have considerable difficulty in checking official

records in the State of Michoacan, any effort to take this

action has been delayed until it is possible for this

investigation to be conducted by personnel of this office

or an investigative informant who has adequate credentials

for that purposes] Nu)

From the foregoing data concerning FIORINI, it
appears that he is probably identical with subject FRANK
ANTHONY STURGIS, It also appears possible, in view of
FIORINI's reported presence in Cuba, the question of his
identity may already have been fully clarified,
