NO 1283-C-TE advised on 5/10/72 that he peCently
talked to CARLOS MARCELLO and learned that CARLO, MARCELLO >
has been approached by New Orleans Mayor "MOONJ{LANDRIEU a
with a discussion concerning the building of4 "new city" =="
which would be located possibly somewhere between the main
part of New Orleans and Slidell, La. Source said that to
his understanding, MARCELLO is supposed to travel to
Washington, D.C., in an attempt to get.approval from the
U.S. Government for the building of this "new city." Source
said that he did not know why LANDRIEU was attempting to
have MARCELLO fund the operation, as he should certainly be
able to do it himself with what he has made since he has
been in public office. .

On 3/17/72 NO 2270-PC advised that he has recently
spoken to CARLOS MARCELLO and had learned that the proposed
deal which he previously referred to was the deal concerning
the sale of Churchill Farms. He said that MARCELLO told him
that tha primary reason this deal failed was because Senator
MICHAELAW KEEFE, Louisiana State Senator, made known his
involvement in the purchase of this property. Source said
MARCELLO told O'KEEFE that it was extremely stupid of him to
allow his name to become linked publicly with that of
MARCELLO, and felt that the resultant publicity probably did
O'KEEFE a lot of political damage. Source said that this
publicity also resulted in the killing of the deal, as the
corporation was not able to obtain money from the U.S.
Government to finance the purchase.

  

Source advised that MARCELLO recently told him
that he continues to spend much time consulting with his
attorneys in the preparation of their court stand concerning
the upcoming Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
hearing concerning the proposed deportation of MARCELLO.
Source advised that he feels that MARCELLO has a very strong
position in these forthcoming hearings and stands an extremely
good chance of not being deported.

Source advised that MARCELLO is still highly
suspicious of EQMGARNER and feels that CLYDE BOURGEOIS is
