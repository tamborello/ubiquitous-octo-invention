DL, 92-339

involved in any illegal activity or is identified as a
known member of LCN, this matter will be immediately
reopened for investigation and the Bureau kept advised
of all pertinent developments.

For the information of the Bureau, JAMES VAUGHN,

Area Security Supervisor, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company,
Dallas, Texas, had previously advised the Dallas Office that ,
due to pending litigation involving the telephone company in i
Las Vegas, Nevada, telephone company officials had issued a :
directive that in the future no information concerning toll Ao
calls would be furnished to any law enforcement agency without H
the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum or an appropriate [
court order.

On 1/4/66, Mr. VAUGHN, a former Bureau Agent,
confidentially advised, however, that he would check to
ascertain if there had been any pertinent long distance tele-
phone calls made from telephones at the subject's residence
and/or his business.

On 1/17/66, Mr. VAUGHN stated that he had reviewed
the toll calls charged to these four telephones (restaurant -
TA 7-0355 and TA 7-7711; residence - TA 7-7501 and TA 1-0863),
and had noted that there was no pattern to any long distance

_telephone calls, that all long distance calls had been made
to apparent relatives, and that there appeared to be no

’ pertinent information to be obtained from a review of these
toll calls.
