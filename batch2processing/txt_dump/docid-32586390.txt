present time. PETERSON advised on 4/8/59 that he was departing
this area for the purpose of going to the Kentucky Derby, at
the conclusion of which he was going to Havana, Cuba, to look
into gambling interests there.

PCI PETERSON advised on 5/25/59 that he had just
returned from Havana, Cuba. He advised that while in Cuba he
was in contact with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, who was still trying
to sell the Sans Souci Casino. He advised that TRAFFICANTE was
supposed to have sold his interest in the Sans Souci but that
actually he still owns the same interest as he formerly did.

PETERSON advises that originally RON WARNOCK went to
Havana, Cuba, in the hopes of putting Spanish language punch-
boards in that area. He advised that WARNOCK was unable to
make arrangements for the punchboard operation but that while
he was in Havana, he was in contact with the operator of the
Sans Souci Casino. .PETERSON advises that his and WARNOCK's. punch-
board operation in Snohomish County depends on obtaining the
boards from PAT ZURLA, Chicago, and ZURLA was to be the source
of the Spanish language punchboards.

PETERSON advises that the source of capital that was
to be used in purchasing the Sans Souci. Casino was from Seattle.
He stated that actually he and WARNOCK could not raise suffi-
cient funds to purchase the Casino but at the same time, due
to the inactive gambling patrons in the form of tourists in
Cuba, caused them to have: little desire to pay the amount
necessary to purchase this Casino at this time.

No further investigation being conducted under this
caption. A separate letter is being addressed to the Bureau
under the. title "RON WARNOCK, ANTIRACKETEERING", instituting an
investigation under the Top ‘Hoodlum Program, UACB.
