‘I have ‘considered this matter, discussed it with
appropriate agent and supervisory. personnel of the Mobile
Office and the following is proposed as a counterintelligence
move on KING's Washington Spring Project.

tiny . KING has quite a following in and around the Selma,
oe Ala, area and has appeared recently in Selma on one occasion 7 -
<} at the church of Reverend L. L. ANDERSON, who, at the time of

KING's appearance, was running for mayor of Selma, ANDERSON

‘was tentatively endorsed by KING and was subsequently defeated

in his race for mayor of Selma.
