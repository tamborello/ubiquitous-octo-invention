b. On 5 March PARMUTH and FRANCOTTE inspected thel LIHABIT
basehouse,*The Station is quite satisfied with the photographic coverage
supplied by{LIHABIT/1, and no problems can be foreseen in the immediate future,
FRANCOTTE is also meeting [LIF ABIT/1 on a regular weekly basis,

    
      

c. On the night of 9 March, PARMUTH and FRANCOTTE visited the
LIMOPE basehouse,. The entire evening was spent with LIMOPE/1 and LIMOPE/2,
discussing the selection of a more adaptable lens and camera, suitable to the
particular needs of LIMOPE/2. Since the 80" Mirrortell lens was still in position
at the basehouse, but had not been used, it was decided to remove this lens from
the area until such time as it was again needed, The window in the target
installation, in which this photographic operation was centered around, has not
been opened in months and LIMOPE/2 has been devoting his full time to photo-
graphing all individuals entering the front gate of the target house. LIMOPE/2
is presently using a Leica camera and 135mm telephoto lens, This does not
render sufficient coverage, and FRANCOTTE is now attempting to replace that
equipment with a longer lens and a SLR camera, FRANCOTTE is now meeting
LIMOPE/1 regularly once a week.
