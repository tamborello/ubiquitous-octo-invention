Mr. HERNANDEZ again pointed out that POWELL had
voluntarily and on his own initiative approached Col. CANTILLO
in Cuba, claiming to possess information concerning planes and
guns to be smuggled into Cuba and that POWELL had made about
two trips to Cuba to see CANTILLO; HERNANDEZ said that
neither he nor CANTILLO had paid POWELL any money, although
they had offered to pay him money in the event POWELL Was able
to furnish any information which could be used as the
basis for any seizures by the appropriate U. S. authorities.
before such arms or planes were shipped out of this country.

; Reference is made to Legat, Havana letter to the
Bureau dated August 7, 1957 entitled "J, E, POWELL, Police
Liaison, Foreign Miscellaneous", wherein it’ is stated that
Col. CARLOS CANTILLO GONZALEZ, -head of the Cuban Army Military
Intelligence Service had originally requested information on
POWELL on July 5, 1957. .

Examination of Miami file on POWELL reflects that
he has a criminal record which includes such charges as forgery,
larceny after trust, worthless ehacks, escaping from convict
camp and impersonating an Army officer, .

In view of the failure of HENRIQUEZ and PRIO to
make availatle for interview their source, the political :
rivalry between the PRIO and BATISTA people, and the fact that
POWELL was obviously attempting to work a con game against.
both factions, the above facts were not considered to constitute
a bona fide kidnapping complaint.

; ._ This information is submitted for the advice of the
Bureau, oo,

Mr. HERNANDEZ also was able to advise Agents immediately
prior to the arrest of POWELL, that he was in possession
of a revolver; This was found on his person at the time
of his arrest,

POWELL was brought before the U. S. Commissione
and placed in jail under $10,000. bond. :

On the evening of August 12, 1957, several hours
after POWELL's apprehension, Dr. ENRIQUE HENRIQUEZ, brother-in-
law of CARLOS PRIO, and a former PSI of this office, telephoni-
cally requested SA GEORGE E.'DAVIS to call upon him in regard
to a "very important" matter. ;

Dr, HENRIQUEZ advised that information had been
received through one of PRIO's associates, whose identity
Dr. HENRIQUEZ declined to-furnish, that "JIM" POWELL, 2 Pe
working with a Puerto Rican known as¥€ARRASQUILLO and a FAP
girl friend of CARRASQUILLO; had.come from Cuba fifteen days
previously with instructions from the Cuban authorities to
kidnap CARLOS PRIO, transport him by plane, then located at
Nales, Florida, make.a landing at a fixed place in Cuba so
that the Cuban authorities could shoot him, claiming that
PRIO was trying to escape from an unauthorized landing; that
CARRASQUILLO would do the actual shooting; that machine guns
Dr.. HENRIQUEZ said that a .
former defense minister. in PRIO's government, NICHOLAS . 9
had come from Cuba and told ANTONIO PRIO, brother of CARLOS;
that there was a project on to kill PRIO,.

Dr, HENRIQUEZ said that the PRIO group would like
to have the information concerning this matter furnished to the
newspapers, so that the public could be informed of the activities
of the BATISTA government, as 1t would make good propaganda for
PRIO. . oe

; ; , ;

SA-DAVIS advised Dr. HENRIQUEZ that the FBI could not
become involved in internal Cuban politics and that it would not
make premature press releases,

SA DAVIS advised HENRIQUEZ that POWELL, who andwered
the same general description which HENRIQUEZ furnished, had

been arrested that afternoon on an impersonation charge and
was in Federal custody.

Dr. HENRIQUEZ expressed surprise and seemed to be
disappointed. ‘

: SA DAVIS told Dr; HENRIQUEZ that he would like to
talk to any persons who possessed information that POWELL or
any of his associates, or anybody else, planned to kidnap
PRIO,; The investigative jurisdiction of the FBI over
kidnapping laws was explained to him,

Dr; HENRIQUEZ said that he would have to check
first to determine whether or not the persons who possessed
such information could. be made available for interview and that
he would immediately notify SA DAVIS on the following morning
in the event they could be interviewed.

Dr; HENRIQUEZ did not call on the following morning
and has, as a matter of fact, not called to date to furnis
this information. .

Also, during the above interview, pr. HENRIQUEZ

was informed that’ if CARLOS PRIO felt that he needed police

protection, that he shaid immediately notify the local police
authorities. , ; ;

: Two days later, HAL MC INTYRE, Investigator,
‘States Attorney's Office, Miami, telephonically advised that
DAVID WALTERS, attorney for PRIO, had asked him to locate .
and interview POWELL concerning the alleged kidnapping plot.
MC INTYRE was advised that POWELL was in jail.

On August 16, 1957, MC INTYRE advised SA DAVIS
that he had interviewed POWELL at the county jail, that POWELL
had denied any plot to kill PRIO, -but claimed that BATISTA's
men had offered himmoney to.furnish‘information coneerning arms
smuggling. .

; Also, on the day following the interview with
Dr; HENRIQUEZ, SA DAVIS advised Consul General HERNANDEZ
that information had been received from a source, which was not
disclosed to Mr. HERNANDEZ .that BATESTAhad allegedly instructed
POWELL to kidnap PRIO. Hr. HERNANDEZ replied that any such
allegation was, of course, ridiculous and that the Cuban
government would not stoop to such. tactics.
