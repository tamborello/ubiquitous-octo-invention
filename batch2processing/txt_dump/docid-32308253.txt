MM 105-1598

VIDAL, CIA, reported on 7/9/63, that FERNANDO CABEZAS

had been pulled out of this operation by CIA; that
SALVADOR GARCIA OLLER, in whom CIA has an interest, will
probably stay in the operation; but that CIA is no longer
in a position to exercise any control over this planned
operation and had so notified U. S. Customs, Miami, so
that appropriate action could be taken by the responsible
Government agencies os u

Mr, WALLACE SHANLEY, U. S. Customs, advised
on the same date that Customs has resumed its investigation
in this matter and he requested that this office furnish
him with any additional pertinent information concerning
plans, etc. ,

‘

For the information of the Bureau, [Mr. JOSEPH
|

MM 635-S has been instructed to obtain additional
information on a current basis concerning developments.

MIAMI

AT MIAMI, FLORIDA

 

Will report further developments to the Bureau
and interested local agencies.
