free Thursday. Therefore, we have set up Mongoose for 4:00
o'clock. Ed Murrow will be on hand.

Herewith are the following papers:

1. The Lansdale schedule.
He bas talked to State (Goodwin and Hurwitch). Somewhat

to everyone's surprise they seemed to have no substantive suggestions,
being simply @ Little unhappy they hadn't been consulted.

All others have concurred (CIA with some reservations).

Suggest you ask for formal concurrence.

2. USZA Report on Broadcasting.

This memorandum was addressed to Lansdale and this is a
bootleg copy. However, Live now asked for one for our file, and
Murrow will bring other copies to pags out. :

Tt 1g a curious memo. It is difficult to figure out what
they are saying - whether they are for stepped-up broadcasting, oF
not. Actually, they've played it cozy by saying what can be done
but at the same time saying we shouldn't ask for trouble.

Marked paragraph on page 5 is particularly interesting.

My general conclusion ig that, given the situation today,
there ig too much on the negative side of all this to justify going

ahead now.

3. Cubans for U.S. Army.
Hemo from Lansdale, attaching Gilpatric paper sent to Js.

Suggest you needle on progress.

    
  

4. Intel igence reports. .

c. Arrangements could be made to buy time on one of ©
seventeen U.S. "clear channel" stations in the-event 2 short-
term tactical situation should arise which would justify such

an operation.

3. Recruitment of, Cubans into the U.S. Army

General Craig reported that the JCS had established a
deadline of June 8th for developing a plan. The Group agreed
that this is now a matter of considerable urgency, especially
since it has been the object of very high level attention, and
therefore General Craig was asked to move this deadline up.

Lansdale's memorandum: ; ;
