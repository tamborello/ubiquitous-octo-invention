_ On March 1, 1962 information was received on a
confidential basis that there was no record of any registered
mail having been sent by Teamsters Local 901 to the Inter-
national. Brotherhood: of Teamsters Office, Washington, D. C.;
during the period February 12 through 27, 1962, tHrough the
-Fernandez Juncos, Santurce, and San Juan stations of the U.S.
Post Office in Puerto Rico, which stations would have been
the most logical stations utilized by Teamsters Local 901.
in depositing mail. It was noted that registered mail was
the only type.of mail which might have been utilized by
Local 901 wherein a permanent record of such mail would have
been maintained by the U.S. Post Office Department. —

On April 3, 1962 additional information was received
to the effect that Local 901 of the Teamsters Union had
recently filed a claimwith the U.S. Post Office, San Juan,
Puerto Rico, for three or four packages which allegedly
had been malled by the Teamsters Union to Washington, D.C.,
in February, 1962, allegedly containing books and records
of Local 901. This claim by Local 901 indicated that these —
packages were sent by reguilar.mail,. ;

The above information was furnished to the United
States Attorney, San Juan, on the same date. .

The above confidential source,mentioned previously,
advised on April 10, 1962, that the reason the books and
records of the Teamsters Local 901 never arrived by mail
in the Continental.U.S., specifically at the Headquarters
of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Washington,

D. C., was due to the fact they were burned by LUIS E GAN,

 

 

Ae.
Bookkeeper, Local 901, and LEOPOLDO RAMOS DUCOS, Loéal’*901 PEE

organizer, This information was. learned in conversation with
LUIS &, PAGAN and when PAGAN was jokingly told that he had
peen photographed in the act of burning the Union's records,
PAGAN stated that this was impossible, as pictures cannot

be taken at night. The confidential source at that time
