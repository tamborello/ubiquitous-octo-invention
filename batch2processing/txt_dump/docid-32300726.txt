interviewed 2/21/63 and though he was cooperative concerning
vending machine matters he claimed he was not acquainted with
ROSSELLI and had never heard of him. It is recalled that

in latter part of 1962, LA 4268-C told ROSSELLI that he,
informant, might go to work for SEEDMAN and ROSSELLI wanted
informant to find out all about SEEDMAN's operations in the
vending machine line. Both ROSSELLI and FRIEDMAN are Friar's
Club members but it is not known if SEEDMAN does, in fact,
know ROSSELLI.
