The company was started during 1946 but did not become
incorporated until 1952. The company ostensibly does
more than $200,000 worth of business annually. Activities
of the block manufacturing operation merged during 1960
with a hauling operation and trade bills have been met
within terms,

The corporation was chartered with the State of
Pennsylvania on September 8, 1947, with an authorized
eapital of $100,000 and the bu
during June, 1946, by NICHOLA

between one’ A,

PRUNER, a general hauling firm inthe Pittsburgh area, and
LA ROCCA. ALMO PRUNER, born during 1928, has been active

in the hauling business since his graduation from high :
school. ALDO PRUNER, born during 1922, worked for his :
father who was engaged in hauling operations in the Bridgeville,
Pa., area and subsequently formed a partnership with his
brother. ROY L. VEY was interviewed on May 15, 1960, by the
informant at which time he declined all discussion of
business, Informant, however, indicated that although the)
financial details of the{North Stan Ce een c Block Camps ny
have never become known €8 him there are indications chat *
the company does between $75,000 and $100, 000 worth of
business annually and has. resources adequate to retire

JEK Law 11 (a)

PG T-3, who has expressed an unwillingness to appear before
any future Federal or state proceedings, has advised that
JOHN CONTI and ROY VEY are still operating the North Star
Cement Block Company in the absence of LA ROCCA. CONTI who
has assumed the post of overall manager and VEY who may

be considered the general plant manager are both extremely
eritical of the PRUNER brothers, ALMO.and ALDO, who hold

the lesser executive positions with the company and are

important stockholders, He said that on March 3, 1961, a
business meeting of "department heads" was called for 8:05 AM
and that CONTI, VEY and ALMO PRUNER were in attendance. He
said that PRUNER as head of the department of sales and
collections made a pnesentation to the other two who were

not only extremely critical of his presentation but criticized
the job he has been doing in his capacity as an executive.

. The aforementioned informantcon advised that the general

financial picture at the North Star Cement Block Company is
not completely rosy but portends some new developments and
Sales techniques. He.said that he gleaned the followin
information from his understanding of the meeting: :

Cement block sales are static but it can readily be seen

that block sales are not enough to keep the company on

a@ stable basis and that building supply material sales are
necessary to augment the company income. By operating on

a "sales as needed" basis it was shown that North Star,

during February, 1961, achieved 37 per cent of its sales in
the building supply field. Organizational officials believe
this is a significant trend and one which will probably be
exploited fully by LA ROCCA upon his return from Florida. .

It is believed certain prices on material such as mortar can
be lowered for competitive purposes. It is now being offered
at $4.50 a barrel and accounts have shown no alarming changes
as a result, although competitors are selling at $4.70. :
North Star is definitely endeavoring to expand under the
guiding hand of LA ROCCA who has promised the company as much
money as it needs. He wants to see definite progress in

sales and ingenuity however, before parting with his money and
