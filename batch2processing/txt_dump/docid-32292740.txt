WEINER: - It's all because of PAT. I asked him not to go
nowhere, but he had to make his move. And he said
I already went to HARRY BUSCH. I told him we
don't need a lawyer, we're early by two months,
let's see who is going to be the Speaker of the
House. Ndéw FINLEY is sending feelers out. ‘

MARCY: He's in the Senate.

; It says about a guy named po the OTHER 4
‘ : . was asked for money to come in on this bill.

a FBI guy came in to see PETE, -

WEINER: The FBI, what do they have to do with it?

MARCY: That's what PETE wonders, they heard that money

WEINER: So what do they have to do with that?

MARCY: - _ They wanted-to check out the source.

WEINER: Oh, those (obs)! They're always stickin' their

want to show that to somebody. Mail it to me.
I'll get it back to you. Now, I'm covering that
other base we talked about. Yeah.

MARCY: You got to let POLLACK know that he made some
moves to knock us. OK. Now cover that base

believed that the legislation discussed above by WEINER
and MARCY concerns this bill. It appears. obvious that Illinois
Representative. PETER GRANATA has previously been approached
by MARCY at the request of WEINER to block passage of this
-legislation. It would. also appear obvious that he has been
promised $25,000 for his efforts in this regard. From the
above conversation it would also appear that as: recently
possibly as last week GRANATA was interviewed by the FBI
in Springfield concerning his position in reference to this

legislation. It is believed that the ——C'dJ mentioned OTHER 4

and BUSCH all have offices at 134 North LaSalle, Chicago.
