Informant stated that a furrier on the 11th
floor of the Stevens Building was recently contacted by
U.S. Attorney's Office and their records were subpoenaed.
The furrier named KASTIL apparently sells furs to a num-
ber of "hoods" including JOE LOMBARDO and ANTHONY SPILOTRO.
IRS apparently wants to see how much was spent at KASTIL's
be defendants in the "Teamster Case".

Informant again stated that defense lawyers are
looking for a number of. witnesses who can testify that
"LURIE is a liar." Recently informant stated he was
contacted by a guy who claimed LURIE took him for $100.00.
Informant stated this guy got "out-conned by LURIE," and
both are good "liars".

Informant stated that efforts will continue to
locate "LURIE" but now the defendants are convinced that
the Government has him in protective custody.

Informant also stated that he heard recently

JAMES MARTIN and LENNIE ROSS had a scheme going to
‘Shake down the steel business". Apparently now there

as a shortage of steel and some companies are having
trouble getting their required amount. MARTIN has a
plan to get money from these hard pressed outfits but
the scheme to be used was not known to the informant.
He will follow up on this if possible.

Informant stated WEINER has wheeled and dealed
all his life and knows all the angles. Apparently he has
run into a brick wall in his own case and the word has
now gotten back to the other defendants in this matter.

Informant stated he knew for a fact that IRWIN
WEINER did a lot of business in Du Page County with the
county officials including the sheriff and district
attorneys and the judges. The fact that he has not been
able to help himself in this matter has caused WEINER a
good deal of grief.

; Informant stated also at this time there was
a discussion among defendants and attorneys as to how
they would handle HAROLD LURIE. They are convinced
LURIE is in protective custody and they now also are
convinced that LURIE, who seldom tells the truth, can
easily by tripped up on the witness stand. Informant
stated that for some reason now the defendants are
concerned about JOE STEIN. They are aware of the fact
that STEIN had many deals with HAROLD LURIE, PHIL
ALDERISIO and IRWIN WEINER. They apparently have no
idea now where JOE STEIN is located and also have no
idea as to what part STEIN will play in their pending
tY¥ial. Apparently informant stated they are not too
concerned about one participating subject in the case
but if two Government witnesses deeply involved in
WEINER's affairs testify, they anticipate a great deal
of trouble.

Informant stated he will maintain contact
with his sources and advise when a motion is prepared
for a transfer of the case from Judge BAUER.

“ . CG 9561-PC advised on June 3, 1974, that his
Source close to IRV WEINER now reports “WEINER is much
worried" over recent developments. Judge BAUER had
indicated he is going "stragiht down the line." BAUER
declined on a number of motions filed on this case and
WEINER reportedly has turned to his old pal, BILL
HANHARDT , for advice.

on SARNO. The word circulating now among some of the
underworld characters in Las Vegas is ‘that SARNO might
be in so much trouble he may consider cooperating with
the Government. Informant stated the way things are
handled now in Las Vegas, if the Mafia characters have
any doubts along this line he would not want to be JAY
SARNO. The way they are working now if the Outfit
regards him as a risk he is going to wind up missing
and get buried along with other missing characters
Somewhere in the sands of Nevada.

“ Informant stated that it probably is not known
that two individuals in Las Vegas exert a good deal of
power particualrly with Las Vegas, Nevada, authorities.
Both are interested in preserving "quiet" State of Nevada
and are doing everything in their realm to stop the recent
outbreaks of violence. Informant referred to two men who
owned a good deal of property in Las Vegas and also on the
Valley Bank of Nevada. These individuals were named as

E. PERRY THOMAS and JEROME D. MACK. It was these two
individuals recently who were able to bail out the

Riviera Casino and arranged for the purchase of the
Riviera by fairly legitimate sources.

- CG 9561-PC advised on May 23, “1974, that he
héard that IRWIN WEINER has. made every attempt to reach
out and contact someone that can help them in the pending
matter. Informant stated WEINER apparently contacted
Judge BAUERS' brother who is a practicing attorney in
Wheaton, Illinois. Informant stated this attorney he
heard is not particular how he makes his money. Informant
stated the word came back to WEINER after contact with .
BAUERS' brother that no way would U.S. District Court
Judge BAUER be influenced in this matter.

WEINER apparently told the other defendants
that it-now looks bad and that they are going to attempt

to get a new judge in their case and have their attorneys
file a motion in this regard.

took over all the assets of Gaylord Products. They also
reportedly took over any other assets they could find
including LURIE's home. Informant stated it was his
Opinion this was done by IRS to protect LURIE because

in his opinion LURIE is so much involved in the teamster
case that he either should have been indicted or will be
treated by the Government as a Government witness. LURIE
by his own admissions, has admitted to informant that for.
sometime he has worked closely with the IRS.

; CG 9561-PC advised on April 2, 1974, that he
recently ran into IRV WEINER at a Rush Street restaurant.
WEINER came over to his table and stayed for a few minutes
discussing vérious family affairs familiar to both.
Informant stated he looked over at the table where WEINER
had been sitting and saw Captain BILL HANHARDT of the
Chicago Police Department (CGPD). Informant stated that
it is a well known fact known to many people that WEINER
and HANHARDT have been close friends for years. After a
short time, HANHARDT came over to his table and appeared
very friendly and then asked informant, "Is your door
open.to me?" Informant replied, "My door swings both
ways," meaning HANHARDT could come and go anytime he
wanted, Informant stated from a few other remarks made
by HANHARDT, he expected a visit from him in the near
future.

- Concerning the Teamster case involving WEINER,
ALLAN DORFMAN, ET AL, he now understands there is some
fighting going on between the defendants. For one thing,
DORFMAN has been having trouble with his ex-departmental
attorney, JERRIS LEONARD. What the trouble is, informant
stated, he has not been able to determine other than the
fact that DORFMAN is of the opinion he should be dismissed
from this case because he did not realize any money from the
transactions that were made. Informant stated he would not
be surprised if this was not true. Informant said you have
to remember that DORFMAN had become a tool of the Crime
Syndicate. He was under the direct control of the Chicago
"Outfit", who placed IRV WEINER in close contact with
DORFMAN and for several years, DORFMAN could not make a

ne CG 9561-PC advised on April 16, 1974, that he
had just returned from Las Vegas, Nevada, and even in

Las Vegas "they" were looking for HAROLD LURIE. Informant
stated wherever LURIE now is hiding he better "stay put".
There are at least 20 Mafia characters looking for him and
there is a special bonus for anyone that can fine LURIE
and kill him,

 

Informant stated that IRWIN WEINER may be
considered expendable by the "Outfit" but certain
others involved in this Teamster Union case have been
a lucrative source of income for the "Chicago Outfit",
and for this reason knowing the importance of LURIE as aN
a Government witness they will not overlook any possi- ~
bility to find him. Informant said when you hear his
name mentioned as far away as Las Vegas and the fact
that they are looking for him in Las Vegas, you can be
certain it is an all out effort to eliminate LURIE before
the trial. Informant stated he himself has known HAROLD
LURIE for a number of years and it was his suggestion that
LURIE not be informed of the hunt now in effect to locate
him. He says LURIE scares easily and is such a shifty |
person that even the Government should not be convinced
that LURIE will tell the truth and testify as expected
when he takes the stand.
i On April 19, 1974, he further advised that the
Teamster Union now has invested $16% million in Dunes
Casino. He said apparently the Dunes is not a loser.
Also he heard that the Riviera was being sold and the

hew buyers were not Mafia connected.

“" Concerning the Circus-Circus, informant stated
he learned that JAY SARNO is now just about out of this
Circus-Circus Casino. Things got so bad that the teamsters
themselves wanted him out before they again stick more
money into this casino.

: Informant stated JAY SARNO now is in serious
trouble with the Government and several Government
agencies besides IRS are now building cases against
him. To top it off, Nevada authorities are zeroing in

that the President. of the U.S. is presently up to. the
Teamster Union and. its present boss FITZPATRICK. The
second consideration is that the local prosecution in
Chicago also represents important ‘people in the. Republican
Party. Informant. stated it is not.a coincidence that IRV
WEINER and ALAN DORFMAN selected attorneys. who are: better
known for their political clout than for their sharpness
in the courtroom.

Informant stated he did not. believe JERRIS: LEONARD
ever tried a criminal case in court and.he represents ALAN
DORFMAN. Informant. stated JENNER is an old-time friend of
his and semi-retired. Informant stated he was sure that

JENNER planned to get only limited part in any subsequent Ces Bor
court battle. Bo et ete

The third contension informant stated in repeating AO

himself was the United States Attorney (USA) THOMPSON is Poe aoe
strictly politically motivated. Informant pointed out that ~*, 7% “A.
THOMPSON is. ambitious and is entirely dependent upon JENNER
and several other leading republicans who are slatemakers
for the Republican Party. Informant stated from a reliable
source he has already heard THOMPSON has had discussions
with JENNER and other important party leaders concerning
his future with the Republican Party. Informant stated

that he is sure THOMPSON wants to run. for Governor or Senate.
He doubted THOMPSON: would: want to take on Mayor DALEY if DALEY
runs for. a sixth term.
: - Informant stated one- of his: sources had a’ conver-
sation with JOE LOMBARDO after the warrant was issued for
LOMBARDO's arrest in the teamster case. He stated LOMBARDO
was furious and told his friend that he had been assured by
WEINER that in no way would the indictment involve him.
LOMBARDO stated that should he get. out of the teamster deal
was ‘not even worth talking about. ;

Informant stated regarding TONY SPILOTRO that his
sources indicated SPILOTORO was very much involved in the
New Mexico loans and that apparently SPILOTORO kept close
watch on IRV WEINER all during the period of the loan
negotiation. His source stated SPILOTORO does not discuss
WEINER and apparently there is. now a\rift. between WEINER
and DORFMAN. -

DORFMAN now claims that he was cut out of
most of the Pail loan in New Mexico. Apparently prior
to that time that the New Mexico loans were approved,

; WEINER was having trouble with DORFMAN. In an effort

i to keep DORFMAN back in line DORFMAN walked out to his
Car one day and several shots were fired at him. The
shots were fired by PHIL ALDERISIO and were only meant
to scare DORFMAN. However, WEINER went a little too far
and DORFMAN himself went to ''the people" and had them
get WEINER and ALDERISIO off his back.

R According to his information received from

people close to WEINER and DORFMAN, when the New Mexico
loan was split up by WEINER, DE ANGELES and others,

DORFMAN was cut out. WEINER at this time was reported

to have told DORFMAN "now we are even''. What WEINER

meant by this, according to DORFMAN, was that DORFMAN's

life had been saved by WEINER at the time the shots were
fired as PHIL ALDERISIO at that time wanted to kill DORFMAN.

Informant stated recently he was at O'Hare Field
and while having a drink at a bar, observed IRV WEINER
drinking with DON PETERS, a business agent of the Teamsters
Union. He stated that he had heard other things about
PETERS, and if there was any close association between
PETERS and WEINER this would indicate any deals sponsored
by PETERS should be watched closely. Informant also added
at this time that very little has been said about the
influence ROSE DORFMAN has over the insurance company
owned by ALAN. Mrs. DORFMAN, ALAN's mother, owns half

a interest in the insurance company and informant stated
that at the time the New Mexico loans were being contem-
plated papers were drawn up to be presented to the Teamster .
Union officials and their attorneys. One of the attorneys
for the teamster consulted at that time was NATE WOLFBERG,
who has his office on La Saile Street in Chicago. WOLFBERG
was believed to possess good background information on this
loan and might be a good person to contact if not already
interviewed. Informant also stated that HAROLD LURIE used
to come to his office on a regular basis and maintain his
innocence as far as being implicated in the Teamster Union
loans. Informant stated from LURIE's conversations it was
apparent that LURIE was cooperating closely with Internal

\ Revenue Service (IRS). Recently IRS moved in on LURIE and
