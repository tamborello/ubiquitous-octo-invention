casino at the Hotel Nacional, advised that JAKE LANSKY was meeting
with MEYER LANSKY in the latter's apartment located on Calle 12 in
i the Vedado Section of Havana. A spot check of the residence of
MEYER LANSKY on this same date reflected the presence of the

he was in attendance at this meeting .[) y/ :
