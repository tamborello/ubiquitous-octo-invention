NUMBERS OPERATION, DETROIT ; .
‘Sourcé adviséd that the numbers operation in Detroit
has been in existence for many years and he has been closely ~
associatéd with it for the past 25 years. Source advised that
when he éntered the operation, the man who completely controlled
the operation was PETER CORRADO and when he died-in 1957, ‘he
had headed this operation for 28 years, During this. time, PETER
CORRADO developed the organization, made all decisions, and
-was ¢n complete control of the numbers operation together with
all other forms of gambling in Detroit. The basic rule’ ‘of | '
PETER CORRADO in the’ numbérs business during all of this time- t
was that the business is to be run as if it weré a legitimate ;
business, The source furnished the following illustration:

 

; In 1952, the number 101 came up as the winning number.
This is known as a fancy and it is always played very heavily.
On this particular day when the tapes were totaled the amount
of money to be paid out. amounted to one and three-quarter
million dollars, There was utter confusion and chaos and
FRANK DI MAGGIO came up to PETER CORRADO and said "Boss, we
are wiped out." You can't pay. You will have to drop the odds
to 300 to 1 from 500 to 1.". PETER CORRADO said "When the bets
were called in what odds did you take them at." DI MAGGIO
said 500 to 1. PETER.CORRADO them said then we pay off at
500 to 1. CORRADO called each person who had a percentage
of any one of each of the four houses and told how much money
he had to come up with that night. Many stated that they did
not havé this amount of money and PETER CORRADO loaned each ~
one their necessary amount of money... By 6:00 a.m., “$1; 750, ,000, 00
was raised and distributed: Source advised he delivered”
$90,000.00 in $100.00. bills, wrapped in newspaper which was yellow
with age. Within six months this loss had been absorbed and the
numbers operation was again making very heavy profits.

Source stated there were four houses which were
owned and controlled by the family. Each of these houses
operated until October 25, 1963, when they went out of business |
upon orders of JOSEPH ZERILLI, Fifty percent of each house was
owned by the members of the three families, ZERILLI, TOCCO and
CORRADO. The ownership of the remainder was divided among
operators of the various houses, These houses are as follows:
