In February 1974, the Attorney General promulgated the Depart-
ment of Justice Management-by-Objectives (MBO) system. As indicated
in the MBO Handbook, the Department's MBO system was designed to be
introduced in phases: in FY 76, the budget and the MBO submissions
were concurrent; the FY 77 Spring Planning Call, which is the second
phase of the Department's MBO system, integrates the MBO submission
into the budgetary process through the Department's program structure.
The. FY 77 Spring Planning Call also contains several changes in re-
porting requirements which will hopefully minimize the formulation
and analytical difficulties experienced in the FY 76 MBO/Budget process.

Given the scarcity of resources which all Government agencies
will be facing in the coming years, it is essential that the Depart-
ment carefully analyze and prioritize its resource requirements so
that it may compete effectively with other Government agencies for
available financial resources.

GENERAL INFORMATION AND POLICIES

A. INTRODUCTION

The Department of Justice's FY 77 planning and budget cycle will
reflect changes in the scheduling, the number of submissions required
and the types of material submitted. Some of these changes are designed
to continue the Department's efforts to improve fiscal and program
management. in a period of increasingly scarce resources and others are
a result of requirements imposed on the Department by the Congressional
Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974,

During the FY 77 cycle there will be four distinct calls for sub-
missions of information: the FY 77 Spring Planning Cali which is the
Department of Justice's management and planning instrument; the FY 77
Call for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) submission; the
Current Services Budget Cal] which is a new requirement of the Con-
gressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974; and the FY 77
Congressional Estimates Call. Appendix A outlines the major events
in the FY 77 planning and budget cycle.

B. SPRING PLANNING CALL

The first of these calls, the FY 77 Spring Planning Call, is
addressed in detail bélow. Organizations will submit twenty (20)
copies of their Spring Planning Submission to the Assistant Attorney
General for Administration by April 14, 1975. The Department's
hearings on FY 77 program plans, objectives and proposed budgets are
scheduled to begin in mid-May 1975 and will continue through mid-June
1975. Organizations will be advised in April regarding the final
Department hearing schedule.

C. OMB SUBMISSION CALL

The second call for the traditional OMB submission will be issued
by the Department in late July 1975; this call will request organizations
to: prepare the FY 77 OMB submission. The OMB submission will be prepared
on the basis of Department budget marks approved by the Attorney General,
subsequent to the Spring review hearings. These Department marks will be
communicated to the organizations by late July 1975, and the Department
will consider appeals up to ten days after the communication of the in-
ternal marks. The Department's FY 77 budget estimates must be submitted
to OMB by September 30, 1975. Pending approval.of the Department's pro-
gram activity structure (see Appendix B), the Department expects the
FY 77 OMB budget submission to conform to the presently approved budget
activities.

stant Attorney General for Administration

SUBJECT: FY 77: Spring Planning Call

Attached is a copy of the Department of Justice FY 77. Spring Planning
Call which outlines the requirements for the formulation of your FY 77: budget
request. In recent weeks, you and your staff have been contacted by members
of the Office of Management and Finance to elicit your experiences during the
FY 76. MBO/Budget cycle and your views of how the process could be improved.
We have attempted to address the problems which were identified throughout
the Department and to make those changes which will simplify and improve the
MBO/Budget process. These changes do not deviate from the philosophy and
concepts of management-by-objectives but, rather, attempt to eliminate some
of the formulation and analytical problems experienced in the FY 76. cycle.

One of the innovations for FY 77. is that organizations will not be
required to submit objectives for their entire range of activities. In FY 77,
we will be more interested jin soliciting objectives in selected program areas.
It remains each program manager's responsibility to identify objectives which
have the most importance for his organization and highlight those specific
objectives which could be of Presidential level interest. You should also
be prepared to develop your objectives in response to policy guidelines that
may be subsequently issued by the Attorney General. In addition, you should
be prepared to define objectives in program areas which are of particular
interest to the Department; you will be advised of these designated program
areas within the next three weeks.

Twenty copies of your FY 77. Spring planning submission should be trans-
mitted by April 14, 1975, to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.

The Office of Management and Finance will provide staff assistance in imple~
menting these instructions.
