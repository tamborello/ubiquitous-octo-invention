Memorandum Branigan to Sullivan SECRET)
RE: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT HE i

_ JOHN FITZGERALD.KENNEDY\ .
62109060

We feel we should disseminate this data since
we have previously disseminated the information we received
from Yuri Nosenko regarding the assassination even though
we recognized some of the data was not subject to proof,
particularly, that occurring within_the Soviet Union.
We feel that by documenting hamrock Jas a roonfidentia1 (S)
informant, contact with who as betn insufficient to
establish his reliability," we will alert other agencies
that the information has not been established as true

al.

We have received information from numerous other
sources that the Soviets did mourn the death of President
Kennedy and that Soyiet leaders felt they could work with
President Kennedy X(w) :

ACTION:
, If yoy approve, we will disseminate the data furnished
bygkthe(ShamrockJinformant as set out herein to the Department ,(S) -_

to cret Service, to State Department and to Central
Intelligence Agency’ .
