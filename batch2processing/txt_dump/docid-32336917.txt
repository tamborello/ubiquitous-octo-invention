* into the United States to seek.aid in the fight against
BATISTA. The name. GALLEGO -is a nickname given subject
by his friends to denote his Spanish origin, and is
often ope to individuals from the Province of Galicia
in: Spain. (e)

GUTIERREZ claims his rank of Comandante ‘was
accorded him by wmmanimous vote of all of the Escambray
‘Mountain group on November 10, 1957. (The group numbered
twenty at the time.) C7

GUTIERREZ has been:on semi-inactive status

since January 1, 1959, at which time the Second Front

was disbanded. However, he does not feel that he can

be considered a bonafide member of CASTRO’s army, since

the Second Front was never officially incorporated into

the rebel army. Accordingly, GUTIERREZ claims that as

of the time he departed Cuba (January, 1961), he had no
official title, posdtion or standing in the CASTRO Regime.
GUTIERREZ said that although his name. appeared on the Cuban
Revolutionary Army roster, he refused to accept ‘any pay
checks and does not consider himself a member of the Cuban ..
Armed Forces. (@) ° : \ :

GUTIERREZ said he arrived in Cuba from Spain
in. 1948.at the age of 14 in company of his mother and two |
older sisters. They entered Cuba legally and did not flee '
Spain as exiles. (¢/)

Subject’s father, CARLOS GUTIERREZ ZABALETA,
currently resides at Linea and F Streets, Vedado, Havana,
Cuba. His father, born in Madrid and a doctor of medicine,
is a specialist in radiology, in connection with rheuma-
tology. His father presently is associated with the
National Institute for the Tourist Industry (INIT), and
is Assistant Director in Charge of Therapeutic Mineral
Water Facilities. His father fought on the side of the
Loyalist groups in their revolution against FRANCISCO FRANCO

It is to be noted the San Antonio Office advised

San Antonio cautioned, however, that it did not
feel that it was possible to make a definite statement
as to the authenticity of the information furnished by
the subject or whether or not subject and his group are
bona fide defectors from the CASTRO regime. It is noted
by the San Antonio Office that subject and all members
of his group positively expressed their desire to actively .
oppose CASTRO, not by forming political groups in the
United States, but by returning to Cuba and providing
actual military opposition to the present Cuban Government.

_ The San Antonio Office pointed out also that in
view of the fact that Captain WOODROW Y. CHIN, CIC, Fort
Hood, Texas, headed a special team of investigators inter-
viewing the subject for a period of almost three-weeks con-
cerning military matters, the San Antonio Office did not
dwell upon these matters and Captain CHIN advised San
Antonio that results of his interrogation would be disseminat-
ed to the Bureau.
