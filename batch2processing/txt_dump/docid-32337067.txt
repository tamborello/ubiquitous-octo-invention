INTERNAL SECURITY ~ DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

Reference my memorandum 8/21/59 pointing out that
Lieutenant Rene Ratole, NA, Monroe County Sheriff's office, Mianii,

obtain certain information desired by Dominicans. Ratole initially
expressed willingness to accept assignment in order to assist U. S.
Government. * : i

By teletype 8/25/59 Miami advised that Ratole had discussed
matter on strictly confidential basis with his supertor, Sheriff John
Spottswood. Spottswood called attention te possible serious personal ~
risks involved to Ratole as well as potential embarrassment to Sheriff's
office if Raiole became involved in difficulties in Cuba. Spottswood
encouraged Raiole to cooperate and report subject's activities in U. &.
but could not approve his proposed trip to Cuba.

By teletype 8/26/59 Miami advised that Raiole had talked via
long-distance phone with subjects, who are in Miami, on morning of that aN
date. They were disappointed that he wis unable to handle assignment
but appreciated his position. Raiole declined to furnish subjects’ - Na
names. of his contacts in Havana whom Roper might get in touch with. ——
However, he offered to try and secure information desired (regarding
whereabouts and status of William Alexandey“Morgan) from his acquaintances /
who travel on Key West-Havana Ferry. H@T6Le PIGNE™ to make discreet _?
inquiries among his contacts on this ferry on evening of &/27/59 and to rm

OBSERVATIONS s : ry

 

5 ie
It is believed Ratole'ts action in discussing matter canfider- oa
tially with Sheriff Spottswood was entirely properi: and that, in facts |
he had obligation to do so in view of possible adverse reflection ~
on Sheriff's office if difficulties did arise in connection with Raio EN
dealings with subjects. Sheriff Spottswood's action in discouraging

toss Proposed Cuban trip by Raiole wis reasonable in view of the circumstances.

Re; JOHN JOSEPH FRANK
WATSON L. ROPER

97-3292

As noted @bove, Spottewood has encouraged Ratole to cooperate.as~ ©
fully es possible so long as foreign travel is not involved. .

; In view of these developments, tt is likely that subjects. —
will adopt one of following courses: (1) Frank or Roper may undertake. —
trip to Cuba personally, more dikely Roper, simee Frank may be >
unwilling ‘to make trip in view of hie notoriety resulting from Le,

Galindegz case (Ge néted previously, there is already some indication ~

: Roper is considering making the trip); (2) subjecta may seek to

recruit another tndividutl, possibly another law enforcement officer
in Florida, with whom they are acquainted, to perform this miaston. - :
it is hoped that additionel information concerning the subjects' plans .
can be secured through Raioles; however, thie te not likely and it ia,
therefore, essential we afferd closest coverage possible to Frank and
Roper to keep abreast of their pliens. ; 2 : :

‘ AGTIONs

 

_ Attached is Girtel to Miami, with copies to WFC and Legats,
Havand. Miami is being instructed to maintain clase contact with ;
Raiole as to outcome with future meetings hé may have with subjects. - ;

| Miami is @lso béing instructed. to afford closest coverage possible +
wns both subjects in effort te. determine their future contacts and ;
activities, particularly with respect to propesed intelligence :
assignment in Cuba. Hiami being requested to utilize spot check
