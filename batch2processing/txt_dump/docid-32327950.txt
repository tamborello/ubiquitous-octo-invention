ADMINISTRATIVE

On numerous oceasions during he summer of 1963, NY 3936-C
advised 8A WILLIAM A, VERICKER that FRANK MC GUIRE is
endeavoring to erect a boys'camp and health resort in
Greenwood Lake, NY. NY 3936-C further stated that
HERSERT ITKIN, an attorney, and the subject are assisting
MC GUIRE in an endeavor to to obtain a mortgage for this
establishment.

In view of the closeness of the informant to this
matter, it is felt that nothing would be gained from an
interview of either GRANELLC or ITKIN and might possibly
compromise this informant.

The file of ‘the NYO Division failed to reflect any
information identifiable with JAY ROSENBLATT, 4465 West S5th
St., NYC, King and Barnes, 1400 2nd Ave., NYC or VINCENT VOLPE,

The current telephone directories for the Greater Miami,
Florida area, reflect that JE 8-8716 is listed to the Bolivar
Hotel, 740 Ocean Drive, Miami Beach, Fla. It is not believed
practicable to attempt to determine what indivicual at the
Bolivar Hotel was called from the telephone of NANCY GKANELLO.

The information reésived.from the Southern Bell Telephone
and Telegraph Company, Miami Beach, Florida, was obtained
from Mrs. LORRAINE ETTER by IC ROBERT JOHN SCHAMAY.

On 8/19/63, AL 3050-PC was recontacted in regard to the

subject. The informant advised that three or four weeks

ago, he received a telephone call from JOIE KAUFMAN, in which
KAUFMAN told him that he was then at JIMMY BARONE's, Murray's
Inn, Fuller Rd., Colonie, NY. AL 3050-PC further stated

that he proceeded to Murray's Inn at which time he joined
KAUFMAN, GRANELLO and a dark coplexioned good looking young
Italian, who was with GRANELLO and whose name was "Tony"
(last name unknown). The informant stated that KAUFMAN
identified "Tony" to him as GRANESLLO's bodyguard. AL 3050-PC
further advised that KAUFMAN, GRANELLO, TONY and KAUFMAN's

wife had driven to Albany, NY, apparently because KAUFMAN's wife,

MARGIE, who is a choreographer, had to rehearse the chorous
girls taking part in the floor show at Murray's Inn.
