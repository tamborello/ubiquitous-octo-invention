Inquiry from richard Rugseit oF Dial Press Concerning Dallas Field ~
Office Association with. Lee Harvey Oswaid and George deMohrenschildt

1. On the-evening of 13.July 1976, at about 2100, Mr. Richard
Russell of the Dial Press and the Dell Publishing Company, came by
my house. He advised that he was working on a book on the Kennedy
assassination and that. he understood I was a friend of George

. deMohrenschildt. _He wanted to know. if I had ever met Lee Harvey Oswald
. or if deMohrenschildt had.ever suggested that I should see Oswald.

I told him no om both counts and advised that I have not seen or
talked with George. deMohrenschildt since the fall of 1961.

2. Mr. Russell attempted.to draw me into discussion of the
Kennedy assassination which. I avoided and wanted to know if I could
give him the name of the chief of the CIA office in Mexico City in
1963. I told him I could not, and he said he could probably get the
name from Mr. David Phillips. I do not foresee any adverse publicity
as a result of Mr.’ Russell’ s visit but felt that it should be made a
matter of record.
