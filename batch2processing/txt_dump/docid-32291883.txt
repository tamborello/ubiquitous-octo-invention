Assistant Attorney General Herbert J, Miller, Jr., Criminal

i Division, has requested that subject Alderisio be arrested on the

morning of 10/9/63 by our Chicago, Illinois, Office on a warrant
obtained on 10/2/63 hy our Miami, Florida, Office which charged
Alderisio with violating the Interstate Transportation in Aid of
Racketeering (ITAR) - Extortion Statute. This warrant was issued
following the filing of a complaint, authorized by the Criminal Divisi
following the receipt of information by our Chicago Office indicating
Alderisio has a passport and is arranging his personal business so tha
ihe can leave the country, The Criminal Division did not desire that
this warrant be served before this time because it expected that a —~
\grand jury indictment would be returned shortly; however, it has now”
i been ascertained that there will be some additional delay in the retur
of such indictment and it is feared Alderisio may go through with his
plans to flee the country,

 

q

Alderisio, a well-known Chicago hoodlum, commonly referred t
as "Milwaukee Phil," is an extremely close associate of top echelon
hoodlums in the Milwaukee and Chicago areas. He is rumored to have

( been a gunman for the old Capone gang. The investigation on which

Docld: 32291883

the complaint was based developed: that Alderisio and subject Traffican
(a top hoodlum of our Tampa, Florida, Office) endeavored te "muscle in
on the profits of a "South American deal" being operated by Sam Kay

(a Miami Beach shylock millionaire); Charles William Bray (Chicago
insurance broker); and James W. Egan (Denver, Colorado, banker), In
early 1962, in Miami, Alderisio assaulted Egan and threatened Egan's
teen-age daughter with bodily harm unless he, Alderisio, was given
one-third of the profits of the "South American deal." Interstate
travel for the purpose of committing extortion is a violation of the
ITAR Statute,

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont
Re; Charles William Bray; et al.

Prosecution of Trafficante has not been authorized by the
Criminal Division as there is no indication he plans to flee the
country, and the evidence against him is not as clear-cut as that
against Alderisio, Bray will be used as a witness against Alderisio
and is now furnishing information in other Bureau investigations wt

| involving Teamsters Union bonding programs, :

It is noted that the complaint filed on 10/2/63 at Miami,
charging Alderisio with violating the ITAR - Extortion Statute,
alleged that Alderisio travelled from Chicago to Miami with intent
to commit an act of extortion against James W., Egan and in furtherance
of this to commit assault and battery on him. It alleges also that

jon or about 3/9/62, Alderisio carried out the latter intent by
Jassaulting Egan and further attempted to perform the unlawful act
4Jo£ extortion by threatening to harm Egan's daughter.

=

The foregoing is-~for your information. Our Chicago Office
is being instructed to effect the arrest of Alderisio and contact
Assistant Director DeLoach's office, which has been supplied with
background data, when Alderisio is apprehended in order that an
appropriate presg release can be made at Chicago.
