On November 18, 1976, information was received by the
Atlanta Field Office that Roland (Bud) Bernard Culligan, Jr.
was in possession of information dealing with National
Security. More specifically, Mr. Culligan was alleged to
be in possession of a "hidden journal" relating his past
twenty years as a CIA agent who had carried out numerous
assassinations for the Agency. It was further alleged that
Mr. Culligan could offer proof as to by whom and why former
President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas; and
that there was a’ danger to President Elect Carter should he
show any dislike toward, or attempt to disband, the Central

Intelligence Agency.

On November 24, 1976, Mr. Culligan was interviewed by agents
of this Service at Leavenworth Prison, Leavenworth, Kansas.
Mr. Culligan claimed to have hidden a journal dealing with
his past twenty years as a CIA agent and assassin, and
requested that he be taken from Leavenworth Prison and
escorted to the hiding place of the journal. Mr. Culligan
refused to turn over a copy of the alleged journal without
being escorted out of Leavenworth Prison to personally pick

up said journal.

Subsequent investigation conducted by this Service has failed

to verify any information provided by Mr. Culligan and no
