"EMMA STERNE immediately took the floor and said
that none of us should everrefer to OSWALD as the
assassin. She said that in refering to him we should
always say the alledged or suspected or accused
assassin.

"SHe said, she felt that we may someday find out
that he was innocent, and that the guilty party is a
member of the right.

"She also said that half of the Dallas police are
members of the JOHN BIRCH Society, and that by announcing
just when OSWALD would be moved they did their best
to see that he would be killed, and therefore silenced
forever.

"BARBARA LINDSAY stated that she believes OSWALD
was innocent, that his death was plotted by the F.B.I.
and the Dallas police and that she felt in four or
five years the true assassin of president KENNEDY may
be known, and that his name would probably be RUBY.

"The money ‘ raised through contributions and the
sale of liquor was turned over to FRANCIS FINK.

"This meeting was sponsored by the Committee
for Constitutional Liberties.

EMMA STERNE - Chairman
