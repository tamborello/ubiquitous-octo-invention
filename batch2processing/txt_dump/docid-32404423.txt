NOTE FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: JFK-Congressional Hearing

1. On 8 November, Steve Tilley, National Archives
(NARA), advised me that Congressman Conyers! Subcommittee on
Legislation and National Security will hold an open hearing
on JFK on 17 November. The apparent purpose is to receive a
status report from NARA on the processing of JFK assassi-
nation records. NARA is the only Executive Branch agency
that has been invited to testify. Gerald Posner, Jim Lesar,
and Robert Blakey are also scheduled to testify.

2. We are not aware that CIA has been asked to provide
anything for the hearing.
