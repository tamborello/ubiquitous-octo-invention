RE; CUBAN REBEL ACTIVITIES IN CUBA

FEBLES advised that the DRE is one group which
has apparently managed to survive the effects of the
arrests of April, 1961, and that this group is probably
as active as any in Cuba at ‘this time. He stated that
the UR, which is a smaller organization, hag been working
in collabo ation with the DRE, FEBLES stated that an
estimate o the ‘Strength of the UR or any of the other
underground groups would be nothing more than a guess
at this time.

/ In December, 1961, MM T-6, a Cuban exile
residing in San Juan, Puerto Rico, made ‘available a letter -
f he had received from his uncle regarding conditions in’
Santiago, Oriente Province, Cuba. In this letter, his
uncle commented that "each day our activities are more
limited." He said that the so called Vigilance Committees
in each block control what food is left in, the country
| and that anyone fot belonging to the Committee is
i considered a counterrevolutionary, The people of Cuba
are living in fear of arrest and execution without trial,
and while a high percentage of the'citizens have joined
organizations which are in apposition to the regime,
"modern airplanes" are needed to fight "these people."

& y On December 13, 1961, Captain CARLOS\TORRES DE

7 NAVARRA, _2137 Southwest _1 i2th Street, Miami, Florida, was
interviewed and identified himself as 'a Cuban pilot who
had flown for Cubana Airlines from January, 1935, until
the end of 1958. When FIDEL CASTRO took over the
government of Cuba in January, 1959, TORRES lost his
position with “the ¢ airlines. He said that he remained
in Cuba and in 1959 began working with various anti-
CASTRO gromps. He said that after a number of attempts,
he was able to obtain permission to leave Cuba and
arrived in Miami, Florida, on December 5, 1961. TORRES~
stated that he had been restricted By the CASTRO - regime

RE: CUBAN REBEL ACTIVITIES IN CUBA

VI, LIAISON BETWEEN UNDERGROUND GROUPS IN
CUBA WITH UNITED STATES

MM T-2, previously mentioned, advised on
November 21, 1961, that the DRE in Cuba had no means of
communication with Cuban exiled groups in the United
States and that in fact it was for this reason that he
had personally come to the United States.

BERNARDO LLERENA, previously mentioned,
furnished substantially the same information regard ing
communication between rebel groups in Cuba and those in
the United States.

HECTOR FEBLES, previously mentioned, advise
on November 30, 1961, that personal courier was the only
means of communication existing between the Cuban under
ground groups in Cuba and the Cuban exiles in the United
States. He related that messages from Cuba are either
sent by means of friendly foreign embassy personnel or
are carried by fleeing Cuban exiles,

VII. EVALUATIONS OF PRESENT STATUS OF UNDER-
GROUND GROUPS |

 

HECTOR FEBLES, previously mentioned, advised
on November 30, 1961, that based on information which
he has been receiving from Wontacts of his in Cuba, it
is apparent that the underground groups there are >Benerally
not functioning with any coordinated plan. 8 said Fhat
some groups were completely wiped opt by the Nant ir
underground measures of the CASTRO regime in April, 1961,
while those that survived were seriously atequsenined:
He said that the leadership which remains in
having great difficulty maintaining contact wien the
mémbership cells and that this lack of communication val
causing the deterioration of many groups,

FEBLES advised that as of that time he wag

- unable to furnish the identities of any of the leaders

of the underground in Cuba. He said that this was
partly due to the fact that arrests and executions

have radically changed the leadership in almost all

of the groups and that furthermore, he did not feel

free to identify any person continuing to operate in the
underground in Cuba,

Regarding the political sympathies of the

“underground groups in Cuba, FEBLES stated that the

UR, of which he was a member, was composed mainly of
small, non-political organizations with a tendency
toward the "right." He said tha the MRP and the 30th
of November organizations have tendencies toward the
"left" and that many of the members of these groups
would ‘continue to support FIDEL CASTRO if he would
merely sever his ties with the Soviet Union, FEBLES
mentioned that the MRP has suffered an almost complete
loss of leadership and is rot a serious factor in the
Cuban underground.
