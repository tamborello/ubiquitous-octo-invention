This mofhing Kemper took a callfrom Mr. Sam Jaffe,
CBS News--Television, New York, Plaza 1-2345, Extension 7801.
He wanted to know if it would be possible to interview the Director
in connection with the current juvenile delinquency problem in
' New York City. Kemper told Jaffe that the Director had a firm
policy in not injecting himself into local matters; and accordingly, [ut]
the Director could not comply with this request: ,

Jaffe then wanted to know if it would be possible to
| interview SAC Foster on the problem of juvenile delinquency, but
that this interview would be general in nature and would not refer ul }
to the specific New York problem, but would cover the broad ‘
national picture.

Kemper advised Jaffe that again it would be injecting
the FBI into the local situation, and we did not deem this advisable. A
Jaffe agréed. Kemper called SAC Foster and alerted him to Jaffe's [i]
call and explained to him the reasons. Foster said that he would be as
alert to keeping out of the situation as it developed in New York. ‘

w ith people at the embassy to try and get back. He said that he wanted to go back
and have a television interview with Khrushchev on his reaction to his trip and that
he had been in touch with Viktor Osipov, who is.a second secretary in the embassy
and attached to the Cultural Section. He said that at the reception at the embassy
on Thursday night, Osipov told him to submit his list of questions and he would see
what they could do about getting him to Moscow to interview Khrushchev, So

country and the people, may hesitate before “pushing the button."
