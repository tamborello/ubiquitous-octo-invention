Clarification: ;

(p) 1. The CIA is continuing to postpone the release of the
aliase$ officially.registered for Anatoliy Golitsyn and his family.
The Agency does not. want to officially acknowledge and link the name
Golitsyn to this alias. To do so could jeopardize Golitsyn’s current
relocation program, which in turn could cause harm to Golitsyn and
his family. Further, the Agency does not want to endanger the _
current method of registering aliases. The agreements with various
federal agencies and the methods of operations used in issuing
aliases are current ones which are used on routine basis by the

Agency.

46) 2. Regarding Mangold’s Cold Warrior, this book-was not
cleare@ by the Agency’s publication board. Further, the Agency has
neither confirmed nor denied the text of this publication, therefore,

it does not constitute an “official” release of information. It

important to note that only Golitsyn’s first and last name in alias

were exposed in this book; not the full (first, middle, and last)

names\of all three members of his family.

& .

(8) .3. Golitsyn has continued to adhere to the stipulations of

his Memorandum of Agreement not to divulge his relationship with this .
Agency. Given Golitsyn’s performance regarding secrecy to date, the
Agency has an obligation to honor in kind by protecting the current
identity of Golitsyn and his family. The recruitment of sources of
high intelligence value has always been one of this Agency’s top

. priorities. For individuals such as Golitsyn, who have placed their
trust in the Agency by entering our relocation program, and are now
US citizens, living in the US, the indiscriminate release of
information seriously erodes this Agency’s credibility and undermines
our programs.
