10960, one volume, (1969-1975). SJ file 105-6133 is the file of
the “Alpha 66" organization. The general indices’ search located
several references to VECIANA. A cursory review of the 8-volume
file indicated that ANTONIO VECIANA is mentioned in additional
serials which were not indexed to him. San Juan is, therfore,
forwarding the 8 volumes so the JFK Task Force can conduct a hand
search on VECIANA. The ang serials were 60, 94, 438, 482,
490, 625, 630, 639, and 679 (1962 - 1965)
