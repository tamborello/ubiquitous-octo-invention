 

 

ll. On 9 April 1974, Wiley met j and turned
over the last statement of the cover fund accounting. Wiley's

claim amounted to $7,475.01.

12. The Office of Security, recognizing that this claim
could not be paid as structured, contacted the Office of
Personnel to determine whether or not Wiley could be paid a
termination séttlement and, if so, in what amount. Although
HR 20-32 does not apply to independent contractors, the Office
of Personnel concluded that, under existing Agency regulation
and using HR 20-32 as a guide, Wiley could be paid a maximum
termination of $9,500. The recommendation was then made to
the DD/M&S to approve payment to Wiley in the amount of $8,000,
an amount somewhat in excess of his so-called
deficit.

 

 

 

13. On 24 June 1974,
contacted Wiley in New York City and attempted to effect a
termination settlement. Mr. Wiley promptly rejected the $8,900
offering, contending that it was reimbursement for his cover
fund deficit and a mere $500 termination bonus. Messrs.

 

 

 

 

© exmisined arain to Wiley this Agency
did not recognize the therefore, could not pay
~ the deficit. The $8,000 Bonus offering was just that-~a

termination bonus and no more. Wiley was not satisfied with

this explanation and claimed that all he wanted at this point

was reimbursement for his deficit. and
told Wiley they wou e back in touch wit im in @

couple of weeks.

 

 

 

14. Mr. Kane, the Director of Security, in attempt to
resolve this matter, called upon the assistance of the Office
of Finance to conduct an objective study into Wiley's claim.
The Office of Finance, after a complete audit, and, based
upon a complete examination of all papers in the file, concluded
that Wiley could be reimbursed for direct cover expenses and
foreign travel up to a total amount of some $20,054.23. The
Office of Finance's conclusions were formulated into memoranda
for the DD/M&S and the Director of Central Intelligence in early
August of 1974, recommending approval to pay Wiley $24,429.23,
which payment consisted of $20,054.23 in reimbursable expenses;
$4,375 in termination bonus. This recommendation was approved

by the DD/M§S and forwarded to the Director of Central
Intelligence, who, on 10 August, questioned the amount of
the termination offer. He felt full reimbursement was not
particularly advantageous to either this Agency or Wiley.
He approved a payment of $12,000, consisting of $8,000 in
allowable expenses and a $4,000 termination bonus.

15. Mr. Colby instructed Mr. Kane to prepare a letter
for his signature explaining to Wiley that this Agency had
thoroughly examined Wiley's claim and could not honor it as
structured. However, certain operational expenses in the
amount of $8,000 plus a $4,000 termination bonus could be
paid. This letter would be given to Wiley at the next
meeting with Office of Security representatives, and Wiley
should be told this is the maximum settlement he can be.

SUBJECT: Charles W. Wiley
Summary of Termination
#343 589
#127 958

1. During the course of the reorganization of the

Office of Security, it was decided that the Security
Research Staff would be abolished. This decision led to
the preparation of a memorandum for the Director of Security -
from the Chief, Security Staff, dated 1 June 1973, captioned,
"Request for Director of Security Assessment Regarding

. Continuance of Functions and Possible Replacement." The

@ last. paragraph of this memorandum stated:

"For immediate planning purposes, to fulfill
the early deadline already established, it would
be eppreciated if you would review the attached
eutiines of existing functions and indicate your
desires regarding the function (continue, continue
with low priority, discontinue) and where you wish
any retained functions to be placed in the reorgani-
zation structure. In the latter instance, I have
attempted to indicate the more likely options for
this to facilitate ycur assessment."

2. On 4 June 1973, the Director of Security indicated
that "Special Access Source," Charles Wiley, should continue
on a low priority and be transferred to the Operational
Support Branch.
