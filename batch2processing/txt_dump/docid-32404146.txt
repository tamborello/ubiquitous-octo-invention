Protecting the Name of Win Scott,
COS Mexico City (S)

a

1. Members of our Historical Review Group have discussed at
length with Don Cryer and Kathy Stricker our proposal to release
Win Scott's name. The two sides have agreed to disagree. (S)

2. This is our position:

Scott's name and position are widely known publicly if
not officially acknowledged (David Phillip's book,
among.other overt publications). (S)

The review board, soon to be established by the JFK
assassination release legislation, will surely demand
that we justify withholding Scott's name. Since his
name is already in the public domain, the board will
probably force us to release it. (S)

The release of Scott's name and position would not set
a precedent, as this project is undertaken in
accordance with the special JFK assassination release
legislation. (S)

HR 70-14 reads, in paragraph e (6): “There is a
presumption that information that has appeared
publicly, including information that the Agency's
Publication Review Board has approved for publication
even if not confirmed officially, will not damage the
national security unless the reviewer can show how
official confirmation could reasonably be expected to
cause additional damage to the national security."
Phillip's book, identifying Scott, was approved for
publication by assistant General Counsel

John K Greaney, not by the Publication Review Board.

SUBJECT: Protecting the Name of Win Scott, COS Mexico City (S)

¢ The continued withholding of Scott's name, in the face
of widespread public knowledge thereof, will undermine
credibility of the Agency, since Scott was a major
figure in the investigation of Oswald's activity in
Mexico City. As you know, Oswald's trip remains a
major issue for the conspiracy theorists. (S)
