MOVIMIENTO UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA

July 25, 1964

The Honorable bean(rask |

Secretary of State

Washington, D.C. -
| .¢ Dear Ur. Secretary

Since October 1962, wnen your late beloved Presidont John F.
Kennody courageously Quarantined Cuba to defend this hemisphere
in the face of a direct threat to it from Soviet ballistic mis~
siles, UNIDAD REVOLUCIONAHIA haa devoted a good deal of ita of-
forts to bolstering the ztrong and cloar attitude expressed by

the U.S. Government thereby.

UNIDAD REVCLUCIONARIA has regularly compiled anJ published
information on free world shipping to Cuba, and is proud to lay
claim to a part of the execessful reduction of both tho number
of free world ships visiting Cuban ports and the countries pure
ticipating in this shaneful.trade.... This campaign will be conti-

_ nued until those firma--tuyers, sellers and snippers--which re-

fuse to face up to their: 2hare of the guilt for the present ai-
werable plight of the _Uuban: people, Jare stripped of their last
d to the horrified

: subterfuge and technicality, and left expose
4 glare of worla opinion along with their infamous business parte

ner, Fidel Castro. .

 

' We nave also brought to yur attention the details of other

‘ _ trade nogotiations between commercial firms in the free world |
and the Cuban Miniatry of rade, including a nefarious plot in-.
volving one of the largest British molasses brokers. The pur-
pose of this plot was to violate the embargo on the sale of Cy .
ban produce in the United Scates. We showed how, through. @
simple ruse, the affiliates of this British organization, in-
cluding one ‘in the United states, make U.S. dollar credits aval=
Jable to the Castro-Comzunist regine. 2

. 4 sources of proven reliatility
inform us of a recent order placed by the Cuban Communist Go-
yernuent with a Dutch firs, Stemmler Imex, for special electro~
nic and photographic gear, including an aero triangulator and
infra red equipment.- Gur report staies that these items are
being purchased for use ty Castro's air force. UNIDAD REVOLU- |
CIOUNARIA urgently requests that you take immediate steps to ve~
rify this information and make strong protest through appro~

priate channels. “, .
