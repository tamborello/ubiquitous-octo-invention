Page 18 of Miami report dated 10/11/63, relates
investigation conducted by Tampa Office in Cocoa Beach,
Fla. °

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tampa and Miami will make inquiry to locate
witnesses who might testify to "character,. truth and
veracity" of BROOKS .

Chicago and Milwaukee attempt to locate witnesses
who might testify to "character, truth and veracity" of
ALDERISIO.

 

- PELOQUIN stated he was reviewing some files on
ALDERISIO, Bufile 92-3141, Chicago file 92-415, Los
Angeles file 92-172, which relates interviews with LITBERG.

 

; PELOQUIN stated in 1961 LITBERG was interviewed cam
by Los Angeles Agents and at that time he was living at SoM
2029 §. Garth Avenue, Los Angeles, California, telephone

VE 7-9095. LITBERG was then employed at 9030 West Pico

Boulevard, Los Angeles, telephone CR 3-2810. =

This is presumably an Anti-Racketeering investi-
gation on ALDERISIO in which Chicago is believed to be at
origin. . :

Chicago forward copies of reports regarding LITBERG
interviews.

 

PELOQUIN stated he expects to leave for. San
Francisco soon but that his assistant HARRINGTON is planning
on going to Denver soon. — . .

Information copy furnished to Denver in event
HARRINGTON contacts Agents there.

ALDERISIO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS
SINCE HE IS ALLEGED TO CARRY A GUN _IN A SHOULDER HOLSTER. ~~
TRAFFICANTE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS DUE 0 C
HIS PAST ASSOCIATION IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES.
