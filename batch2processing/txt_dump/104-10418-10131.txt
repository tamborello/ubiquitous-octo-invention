files which were provided by your office, or in cases
where the files came from the outside, those which should
properly be stored in your custody, and arrange to retrieve

3. Much of this material may be soon requested by
FOIAers. All of. this material is covered by an agreement
between the DCI and Congress which requires that it be

alter the fifes in any manner after you have retrieved
them until we have decided upon 4 course of action. to
