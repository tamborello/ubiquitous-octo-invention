information to a Telephone Company Special Agent.

JOSEPH ERNESTO MATRANGA and FRANC. 7 Quek ADORE. 4 Lif
MATRANGAare married to daughters of Detroit hoodlum:JOHN te
’ PRIZIOLA, and it may be that the MATRANGAS have a‘group of
hoodlums over which they exercise some control without being
actual members of the La Cosa Nostra.

. An attempt was made to develop MIKE AIELLO as
an informant, and although at first he appeared to.be
cooperative, he refused to furnish any information concerning
his own activities or the activities of the MATRANGAS .

Wo . By letter\dated 3/24/64, the San Francisco Division |

 

advised that ANGELO INO, reported "CAPO", of the La Cosa
Nostra, San Jose California, had been in San Diego sometime
in January, 1904, and contacted SALVATORE and FRANK

BOMPENS IERO. The purpose of thi rontact is not known;
however, of recent date SALIATORE/SGnESNS ERO, who had
licenses for The Corsair and The Spo bars in downtown San
Diego, taken away from him by the California Alcoholic
Beverage Control Comitission, is said to be buying control

of local bars in the San Diego, California, area using

other persons as owners of record, since he cannot personally
own a liquor. license, .

In this regard PCI JACK OWENS GOSS advised that

SALVATORE BOMPENSIERO was purchasing "The Carousel", a bar
and cafe in El Cajon, California, and.pointed out that
BOMPENSIERO was there every day redecorating the bar and
getting the place ready to reopen it. However, a check of
Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission records at San Diego
,revealed that this bar was licensed in the name of _ARCHTR
VAKINA, 2016 Anaheim Street, Long Beach, California, on

#378 /64 5 ’ and “BOMPENSTERO"s“namedoes “Hot appear in the record
at all.

Informants in Tijuana, B. C., Mexico, are following
the qnccivaties of JASPERE sob kdoninas who has been identified
as a member_of La Cosa Nostra b 48-c-TE. His activities
have not beén extensive to-date. |
