Initiatibn Rites

The fingers of the candidate and his sponsor are
pricked and blood mixed as a sign of brotherhood, hands of
all are joined in a circle, a saint's picture is burned, and
an oath taken in Italian that the member will obey the orders
of his leaders and will place the welfare of the organization
above anything else, including family or religion.

in. T+. said he was not familiar with any system
of choosing a sponsor at an initiation through the procedure
of having pérsons in a circle extend fingers in any number
from one to five, taking a count, and then using this number
in counting around the circle to pick the sponsor. He said
this system has been used on occasion to select a man to

take part in a"“hit."

Odligations of Membership
... , Orders of the boss must be followed under the
penalty of death fpr failure to obey. ;

a Members: must not traffic in narcotics under penalty
of death,

Members must obtain the consent of their leaders
before they engage in.any activity which might affect another
member, Thus, he must consult with his leader before
engaging in any criminal activity or before engaging in any
business , Since these might conceivably affect another
member,

- NY T-1 has advised in April and May, 1964, that
the following qualifications for membership are necessary be-
fore a candidate 1s acceptable in the Milwaukee "outfit."

 

Qualifications for Membership

A prospective member must be of Italian blood. .
Originally, he must have been a SiSilian, but this limitation
is no longer in effect.

*

- It is not necessary for the prospective member to
commit myrder on behalf of the organization. At times this
was a qualification. Some recently 'made" members may have
qualified by the murder of ANTHONY J, BIERNAT in January,
1963, according to the informant.

The candidate is proposed for membership by another
member who likes him, may have worked with him in criminal
activities, and knows his potential. In the past, each
member of the family was asked personally if he had any
objection to the candidate, and a "blackbali" would eliminate
him from consideration, All members are not consulted today;
the decision to admit a member is made by a few leaders.

, The candidate must never have cooperated with law
enforcement officers.

In the past the candidate was inducted in an
initiation ceremony during a"tourna} or general membership
meeting, at which attendance by all members was compulsory,
This tradition is not followed today.

Two initiation ceremonies were held in the past
which followed neither the old tradition of polling membership
for possible objection or the tradition of conducting the

¥ initiation at a general meeting of the membership. In
February or March, 1963, at the home of JOSEPH BALISTRIERI,
father of the boss, FRANK BALISTRIERI, an initiation was
conducted of STEVE DE SALVO and PETER BALISTRIERI in the
} presence of only a few members, A maqnth later, in the basement

ADMINISTRATIVE:

MI 623-C-TE has supplied information which alleged
that a high-level meeting of "La Cosa Nostra" members was |
scheduled to take place at the farm of SAM “Teets" BATTAGLIA'
located at Pingree Grove, Illinois, on 8/2/64. This meeting
was postponed, according to the informant, and rescheduled for
sometime in October, 1964. All offices should be alert for
any information within their respective territories which would
indicate ‘travel plans of known members to the Chicago area -
during October, 1964. Such information should be given
priority attention and immediately disseminated to the Bureau
and appropriate offices.

For purpose of brevity in the preparation of the
details of this report, infcrmation received from reporting
offices has been summarized in many instances. Where .
information was attributed to a member of "La Cosa Nostra",
or a highly confidential source, that information was given
priority of selection. =FO

The name "La Cosa Nostra" is not necessarily binding
as a requisite to the existence of an organization in a given
eity having a common origin with the "Mafia". However, in
order to qualify an organization as belonging to the same
criminal conspiracy as "La Cosa Nostra", certain common
requisites have been found to be necessary within. the
organization.

‘ The requisite of Italian parentage for admission to
membership appears without exception. Knowledge of and
obedience to the rules of the "commission" are binding on all
members. In addition, the réquirement that introductions

can be performed only by a third party 1 member is apparently
rigidly observed,

Fringe organizations in various cities which are
composed of [Italian and non-Italian members do not qualify
on the basis of similar initietion rites and a common

! purpose cf criminal endeavor. Member sources or highly
confidential sourses reperting the discussions of members

are knowledgeable, for the most. part, of the basic parlance
and terms we now associate with "La Cosa Nostra". An example
which illustrates tre continuity of this knowledge by member if
sources is illustrated in the information reported by MI 623-C-TE ye
of the Milwaukee Office and set fortn in tne details of this

report. .

 

 

 

_ Each office should continue to direct its efforts
toward the objective of developing member and highly confidential
source3 within the organization known as "La Cosa Nostra".

It is noted that more than one T symbol was used to
cover the same informant in several instences during the
preparation of this report. ‘This was done to further conceal
the identity of the informants as the source of information.
