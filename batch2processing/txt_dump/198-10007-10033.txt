(2) The initial staffing of JUWIFA was inadequate and required
considerable personnel augmentation to provide internal and external:
security, communications and administrative support, liaison, and additional
staff personnel :to plan and conduct: operations.

 

{3} Additional personnel and equipment were obtained from the
: Army and Air Force to provide essential communications on a twenty-four
i hour basis, provide adequate administrative and control procedures, and
i augment the staff to meet all operational requirements.

‘ (4) Based on the augmentation needed to make JUWIFA fully
operational, recommendations were submitted by COMJUWIFA lettor, dated
26 November 1962, subject: "Organization for the Conduct o conventional
Warfare in the Atlantic Command Area." This letter proposes a new Joint
Table of Distribution providing. for a full wartime complement, a planning
staff, and the necessary staff ‘augmentation to bring the planning staff
to its full wartime complement.’ :

 

b. ARJUWIFA,

(1) Colonel William Evans-Smith, Commanding Officer, 7th Special

Forces, JUWIFA (COMARIUWIFA) on 26 October 1962. A command and control
element, |Special Forces Operational Base (SFOB);\was activated at Fort

Jisted in Appendix II to Annex Y of CINCLANT OPLAN 314/316-61, }less the]
