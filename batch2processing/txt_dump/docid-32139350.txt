Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan
RE: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY
62-109060

knows well as he is also a polygraph examiner, having been
trained at the Keeler Polygraph Institute. Harrelson was
advised by his source that Russo appeared at source's office
on 6/19/67 to be afforded a polygraph examination regarding
his story of the plot to assassinate President Kennedy,
Russo's breathing, however, was so erratic he was considered
an unfit subject for polygraph examination, Russo told
Harrelson's source that he did not’ know if Clay Shaw was at
the meeting or not. Russo stated he had fully intended to
go into court and testify that he did not know if Shawws
present or not but became angered at a question by Shaw's
attorney. Russo admitted that he had undergone psychiatric
treatment for a year and a half and also admitted homosexual
| sour After ‘giving Garrison a verbal report, Harrelson's
source stated he was told in no uncertain terns to keep
|: mouth shut. a
Harrelson's source also stated he gave Mrs. McMaines
four separate polygraph examinations at the request of ‘an _
attorney, in Des Moines, Iowa, following a pretesting inter- -
view during which she admitted becoming pregnant by Russo
and engaging in prostitution in New Orleans. She denied ever
meeting Shaw or Oswald and stated she never attended a
party at Ferrie's apartment, She also stated Russo asked
her to marry him to keep him out of the service, Also” she
stated she had been contacted by two of Garrison's men in
Omaha in an attempt to persuade her to return to New Orleans
to give testimony, This she refused to do even after being
promised new clothes and that she would stay at the finest
hotels. Polygraph examination indicated McMaines was
substantially truthful.

OBSERVATIONS:

Harrelson furnished the above information on an
extremely confidential basis and urged that under no circun-
stances should his identify be divulged and that extreme
caution be exercised in use of his information inorder not
to in any way violate the confidential relationship between
the PCI and those individuals he named, It is believed
that the information regarding Russo's admissions and

‘Mrs. McMaines having been afforded polygraph examinations

should be furnished to the Attorney General,
