that BOSCH had recently contacted
GULLLERMMOMORALS leaders of the WIMLENTO REVOLUCTO
ARIO FRANK PAIS. (MRFP), an antisCASTRO group of Cuban
exiles in Miami. He appealed to them to support an
MIRR plan to picket in Miami as a protest against the
arrest and prosecution of JOSE RODRIGUEZ PEREZ. Both
FONSECA and MORALES told BOSCH that they could not
commit the MRFP because such action might be interpreted
as a protest against the United States government, and
the MRFP did not want to become involved in such acti-
vity. They pointed out to BOSCH that the guilt or inno-
cence o£ RODRIGUEZ should be determined by the federal
court. They also advised BOSCH to forget about the -
picketing since he is in enough trouble already.

 

On January 18, 1966, MM T-3, a former Cuban

United States courthouse in Miami where a hearing was
scheduled that day for RODRIGUEZ, ‘It was observed this
picketing did occur as planned during the morning and
afternoon at the courthouse. About 50 Cubans partici-
pated. The federal judge refused to reduce RODRIGUEZ’
bond and ordered him returned to Puerto Rico for trial.

On January 13, 1966, MM T-2 advised that BOSCH
and MARCELINO GARCIA disclosed that they were going to
attempt to form a unity of Cuban exile groups. BOSCH ~
explained that this would make it more difficult for
