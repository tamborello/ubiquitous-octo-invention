RIENTAL PARK RACE TRACK Havers, Cu ba
Information was "previously furnished Legat, Havana, “that

an individual known as 'JOCKEY"{DENNIS, a former con man, had purchased

an interest in the gambling casino at the Jockey Club.at the Oriental

Park Race Track. On May.29, 1958, HAV-31 advised that this individual

had died on that date of pleurisy.

 

was June 16, 1958, PCI[._] (conceal) verified
the fact/ that "JOCKEY" DENNIS had died. This source stated that
wGEORGEALEVINE, FBI_No. 382915, continues to operate the Oriental
Park Race Track as well as the casinos at the track. Source said
that the track is losing about $5,000 a week but that LEVINE appears
to have unlimited resources. Source noted that the profit at the

casinos is not sufficient to offset the losses at the track.
GENERAL INFORMATION

Sources have advised that there has been a recent improve-
ment in tourism in Havana with the resultant slight increase in
activity in the casinos. At present, only two casinos are reported
to be breaking even or better. These are the casinos at the Hotel
Capri and the Havana-Hilton. Sources feel, however, if the political
situation remains reasonably quiet that all the casinos will
eventually be showing a profit.

On May 14, 1958, Mr. Thomas Kelley, mentioned previously,
advised he had been visited by JOE Z IPSKY, who claimed to be the/*

Letter to the Director

 

Havana files indicate that on January 1, 1958, Dr. Aristides
Menendez, a contact of the Havana office, informed he had recefved infor-
mation from a friend, who requested that his identity not be revealed,
and who has contacts with labor leaders in New York City, that one
JOHN SCHWARTZ, a labor racketeer from New York City, had been vacationing
in Havana at the Havana-Riviera Hotel. Dr. Menendez said that his source
claimed that SCHWARTZ was a "right-hand man" to FRANK COSTELLO.

On May 20, 1958, the Spanish language newspaper, "Informacion,"
carried an advertisement concerning a land development project in the
Isla de Pinos (Isle of Pines), Cuba. This advertisement indicated
that a large hotel-motel and gambling casino would be constructed on
the Isle of Pines. On June 5, 1958, JACK LANSKY advised that the
publicity about a new hotel and gambling casino to be constructed
on the Isle of Pines was simply a land-selling promotion on the part
of the Mayor of Havana, JUSTO LUIS POZO, who has substantial property
interest there. LANSKY stated.that tourism is and has always been
"dead" on the Isle of Pines and that the publicity was an effort on
the part of POZO.to realize a profit on his large land holdings there.

LANSKY said he had serious doubts that any hotels or
casinos would be built in the foreseeable future on the Isle of Pines.

_ On June 3, 1958, HAV-4 advised he had received information
that ROBERTO FERNANDEZ MIRANDA, the brother-in-law of President Batista,
had installed a private guard force in ali of the gambling casinos to
insure there would be no difficulty in operation. Source said that
the head of this guard force is Lieutenant FERNANDEZ, who is usually
located at the casino at, the Hotel Capri and that the Hotel Capri
pays FERNANDEZ’ salary. &) ue

had decided to sell their rights to this concession. He stated it
appeared this decision was brought about ‘by the edict of the Nevada
State Gambling Board requiring a separation of interests by individuals
t owning gambling operations in Cuba and Nevada.’ LANSKY advised that
; while the combination would have to sell their. concession rights in
a poor market, nonetheless they had made a substantial profit on
*' their initial investment in the casino during the first two years of
operation and they would not suffer any loss. ~

LANSKY stated he was certain the selling agreement would
have to be acceptable to the Hotel Nacional; in that the caliber and
reputation of the individuals buying the concession will have to meet
with the hotel's approval. JACK LANSKY stated the question of whether
or not he would remain in.Cuba and operate the casino would depend upon
the identity of the individuals who bought the concession. ,

/
LANSKY stated the combination had yet not opened the |
Stardust, a new gambling casino in Las Vegas which had been built by
them because of difficulty in obtaining a license for the Stardust
until such time as they have sold, their interests in Cuba.
\ .

LANSKY stated the edict \of the Nevada State Gambling Board
requiring a separation of interests was strictly a political maneuver
directed in the main at CLIFFAJONES, . former Lieutenant Governor of

Nevada, and that while the decision would, ‘of course, affect JONES,
who has just recently invested a substantial amount of money in the
Hotel Havana-Hilton, it was also affecting other individuals with
interests in both places who have nothing to do with Nevada state
politics. He stated that JONES, prior to buying an interest in the
gambling casino in the Havana-Hilton, had discussed the-matter with the
Governor of Nevada to insure there would be no difficulty and had been
assured he would have no problem. LANSKY stated that subsequently,
however, JONES, a Democrat, had thrown his support behind other
Democrats in the forthcoming Nevada elections in November and as a
result, the present incumbent, a Republican, had sent the word down
to the Nevada State Gambling Board to "put the squeeze" on JONES.
