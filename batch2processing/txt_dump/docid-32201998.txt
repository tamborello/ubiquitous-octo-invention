SECRET
RE: FOREIGN POLITICAL WATTERS - CUBA

The Revolutionary Governmert of Cuba makes clear its
protest at this time and urges corresponding sanctions, It
claims the retucn of the kidnapped citizens and of the Cuban
fishing boat "Elvira".

2, The manifestations of the Press Cfficer of the
North merican Department of Stade, Richard I. Yhillips,
disseminated by the cablegraph agencies on June 19, constitutes
a manifest incitement to sedition, to subversion and the
reiteration of the interventionist policy of the United States
concerning internal questions of the iepublic of Cuba. The
Government of Cuba makes clear its protest against such
manifestations which indicate nothing else but the continuation
of policy which has cost the United States uncountable reverses

- and dangers.

3, The Revolutionary Government of Cuba protests,

equally, the recent flight over Cuban territory for the purpose

of espionage by a military airplane of the United States which
its own North American press divulged and werns tht the
artillery of Cuba has orders to shoot at whatever foreign war
plane which fies over our territory.

4, On the 17th of June, Customs égents of liami,
Florida, announced the confiscation, in an abandoned airport.
in the area of the iverglades, of a bi-motor airplane, of
the Beechcraft Bonanza type, at the moment at which it was
ready to take off for Cuba, with the proposition of bombarding
the oil refinery located in Havana Bay and containing in its
cabin napalm bombs, explosives, grenades, small arms and three
hundred charges of dynamite, The six crewmen of the plane,

RE: FOREIGN POLITICAL MATTERS - CUBA

. This action, as well as the attack made at the
end of last April against this same Cuban refinery by a plane
which took off from North fmerican territory, obliges us to
accelerate our defense preparations in order to be in a
position to intercept and shoot down any war. plane which: .
flies over air space at any altitude. :

5. Today the leaders of the counter-revolution
have openly proclaimed from North American territory the |
carrying out of activities of infiltration and introduction
of arms in the country in order to carry out acts of an
aggressive character against the Cuban people. These arms
and these agents could only come from the United States or
other countries near Cubae

This violates international norms. This creates a
climate of insecurity in the continent, because only the
governments which respect the rights of_ other countries can:
démand respect for themselves. These deeds contribute ~
nothing to the improving of relations between the United States
‘and. Cuba, or to the diminishing of the existing tension or
the dengers and aggressions egainst our country which pro-
foundly affect world peace.

It is lamentable that the Government of Cuba sees
the necessity of resending these notes of protest as a
consequence of deeds which in any light are arbitrary,
irresponsible-and uncontrolled; which have already overwhelmed
‘world opinion; which cannot view without great concern
the repeated attacks against Cuba, and which again seriously
endanger peacee
