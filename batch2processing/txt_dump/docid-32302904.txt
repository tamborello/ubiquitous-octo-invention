Sergeant JOHN POLLARD, LACSO Intelligence Bureau
on August 17, 1972 advised he and his partner had interviewed
AHARON EDWARD CHOTSA on August 16, 1972.

POLLARD stated CHOTSA indicated he had hired
SMITH as an employee, knew SMITH to be of questionable
background, but since SMITH was very knowledgeable of
electrical contracting business and promised to bring in
additional business, CHOTSA was willing to hire him.
POLLARD stated CHOTSA told him he’ was paying SMITH $400
a week, and the house and phone on Principio Avenue in
Malibu was under CHOTSA's name. Sergeant POLLARD said it
was his impression CHOTSA had turned con man himself and
was not trustworthy.

By communication dated December 4, 1972, the Los

Mr. LUDWIG M. SHUSTERICH, Ex-Vice President for
Weider International, Inc., 21100 Erwin Street, Woodland
Hills, California, on November 28, 1972, advised that
approximately two months ago DALTON CARL SMITH formed a
company by the name of Algernon, Inc., and SMITH was given

Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas,

Mr. SHUSTERICH advised DALTON SMITH has opened a
company office located at 3641 Leland, San Diego, California,
with telephone number 714-459-4027. He advised SMITH is
contemplating moving to San Diego, California, and is
looking for a home in that area.

By communication dated February 22, 1973, the
New Orleans Division advised as follows:

On Februagy 20, 1973, Mr. LOUIS LIGHTNER, Inspection
Division, FDA, New rleans, Louisiana, advised Special Agent
BERNARD P. BLAIS that results of lab analysis conducted in
Washington, D.C., pertaining to Weider Food Products (Food
Supplements), samples of which were obtained from Schwegmann
Brothers Giant Supermarkets, New Orleans, Louisiana, determined
that out of five samples analyzed, only one of the samples was
found to be deficient in vitamin E. LIGHTNER advised that
since the merchandise containing this vitamin E at Schwegmann
Food Stores amounted to only $36.00, the matter was referred
to FDA, Los Angeles, for further investigation concerning
this particular food supplement. LIGHTNER further stated
that FDA, Los Angeles, has advised that Weider Food Products
is not the manufacturer of the vitamin E implemented in the
food supplement, and, therefore, is not directly responsible
for the “out of compliance’ concerning the vitamin E in the
food supplement. It is LIGHTNER's understanding that since
the analysis was concluded, the Schwegmann Food Stores have
returned the entire shipment of Weider Food Products back to
the Weider Company in Woodland Hills, California.

Angeles Division advised as follows:

Hills, Califomia, on January 26, 1973, advised DALTON CARL
SMITH continues to be associated with that corporation on
a contractual basis. Mr. SHUSTERICH stated he had not
received any orders from SMITH for an extended period of
time and is now apprehensive of SMITH's relationship with
the corporation since SMITH has been assigned exclusive
distribution rights for Weider products in 12 southeastern
states.
