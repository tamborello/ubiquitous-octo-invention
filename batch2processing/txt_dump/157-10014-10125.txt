Senator Mathias. My role here seems to be the Devil's

Senator Huddleston. Good.
Senator Mathias. There is no question about the writing
American press or the value in print domestically. Maybe the
role, any legitimate role that news men could, journalists,
writers could fulfill is available. through the. information
agencies, USIA and groups of that sort. |
| So does anybody know whether there is any real need
for allowing some latitude, which is not covered by situations
that can be envisioned under USIA or other programs? : a

apparently what you are trying ~~ you're not trying touprotect
the newsman. You are trying to protect the reader who doesn't
know that. what he's getting is being spoonfed to him from the
CIA, and I don't know why we would be so concerned about

protecting newsmen from working, or prohibiting them from

working, because I think they have a right to do that as
American citizens, just as they do to work with the Department
of Defense or any other agency.

Mr. Bader. You would then rescind the Agency's standing
prohibition? . .

Mr. Kixrbow. I just don't think you ever. prohibit it in
law. . .

Mr. diGenova. Are you talking bout an affiliated,
accredited journalist, because that's what the Agency regulatio
deals with. Tt doesn't deal with an American citizen. It
deals with an accredited person, whether he is a. foreign
national or an American.

Mr. diGenova. The John McCloy exceptions to that rule, the
are the only ones that are protected.

Mr. Aaron. “That justifies Charles' view that there are
some similarities between Ford Foundation and Government
sponsored activities. .

Mr. Bader. ‘Where our discussion was left before lunch
was on the question of the covert use of U.S. journalists and
media institutions, and as it was laid out, it was indicated
that the CIA's intended internal prohibition on the use of the

media extended to the internal prohibitions on the use, opera-

ete,

tional use of individuals, American and foreign, who ‘were ; ae

accredited to American media organizations,
As I heard it this morning, what we were discussing and

moving to was. to extend ‘that prohibition to cover all American

individuals and media organizations, and that, the question then
law or a recommendation, or an insistence, if you will, to the

50-10, to put all media personnel, American media personnel on
the prohibited list, and that is I think where we were.
Senator Huddleston. ~ I think that's an accurate statement.
That's where we were.
. I had expressed ‘a thought that I thought that it ought to
be expanded to include all, but we should hold off on the

statute business for the time being. -

3 Mr. Bader. And as I heard the corisensus this morning,
