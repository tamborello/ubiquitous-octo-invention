the following information, on vay
Agent of the FBI: .

Description of Raul Roa

Cuban Secretary of State Raul. Rea is. an

idealist, with deep-reoted complexes, but is not a
Commmist. He closes his. eyes amd mind to what he
does not want to see, or take cogmizanmce of. (Just -
before departing for his January, 1961, appearance
before the United Nations Security Council, he stated
Russian Intelligence had informed the Cuban govern-
ment that the United States intended to attack Cuba
and change its government before January 20, 1961, so
that outgoing President Eisenhower would not leave
this problem to incoming President Kennedy for solution]

Sewrce recalled that students used to tease

' Roa when he was a professor at the University, by tell-

ing him he “should rum for president, and Roa actually
believed the students were serious , and still dreams
that he may be president.

There is an acute problem in the selection
of personnel for foreign posts, both from the stand- 3
point of loyalty, and, also plain lack of discretion, :
due to Cuban loquacicusness. -The personnel for foreign :
posts are being carefully selected and screened by :
members of. the Commimist Party, who are themselves
earefully selected through the aid of Russian technicians,
to avoid defections by the Cubans. All those: selected
