Dear Nr. Frohbose, JE.
Re:- Salvatore Momo
ae .

Thank you for your letter of April 25th, 1968, and the
photograph of Salvatore Momo Giancana.

Zo The photograph was shown extensively throughout both
casinos at Freeport and unfortunately. none of theémployees
seem to remember Giancana alias Mancuso,

4, According to A.S.P. Thompson's source, Giancana was at
Preeport approximately two months. ago and at that time he was
using the name of form Witiiams and he stayed at either the
imcayan Beach Hotel or the Kings Inn. The source, an ex-Chicago.
police officergiclaims to have been in conversation with Giancana
and Giancana is said to have offered Mr. -‘Thompson's source a

job at the Landmark Fotel, LasVegas, The informant described

the Landmark. Hotel as being located near Las Vegas Convention
Hall and that it is a round building with a "bubble on the roof",
The informant stated that Giancana frequents the M.C.M. Lounge,
1638 South Cicera; Chicago, Illinois, :

 

5. It is unfortunate. that the hotels at Freeport do not keep
files of their. cuests as far back as two months ago and ovr
efforts to get corroboratichipmoeyed fruitless, CONF TIAL

fomust admit that I find it rather strange that none of
@ casino employees seem to remember Glancana alias Mancuso,

h
ut on the other hand, it may be a-case of wilful blindness.
r3.P, Thompson considers his source as being very reliable ©
on that assessment I am taking steps to ensure thet Ciancana!
me is placed before our Director of Immigration with a view to
wving him declared undesirable. | mee
