of such electronic interceptions are well or even hardly known.

On the contrary, our abilities in this regard are, and should
remain, closely guarded secrets. Electronic intercepts of

foreign conversations is an investigative technique that we

employ on a daily basis. We ca t afford to compromise its ,
effectiveness by admitting t¢ at, fas long ago as 1963, we were x
able to and did intercept a [trarsoceanic telephone conversation sj
conducted on a dedicated circuit )between two reign individuals,
ene of whom was located in the Soviet capito Disclosure would
also reveal the speed with which we were able to translate and
digest the conversation, our interests and priorities, and what

we considered important or trivial. - Such information will be

used ‘to develop and deploy effective countermeasures.

 
 

Documents Which the State Department Seeks to Protect 4
Portions of documents 10402, 10133, 10170, and 10336

reveal our targeting and investigation of Russian officers,
agents, and establishments. Long standing FBI and State
Department policy has been never to officially acknowledge that
the FBI investigates foreign officials or establishments not
involved in espionage or other criminal activity. This policy
has evolved for a number of re sons, at least two of which
warrant discussion here. yu .

First, if we officially confirm what the public may
logically suspect in this regard, the country in question would
be all but compelled to diplomatically respond. We May presume
that most nations will tolerate in diplomatic stoicism the
clandestine intelligence activities of their peers so long as
such activities remain officially covert but no country can be
expected to countenance the publicly avowed targeting and
investigation of their diplomatic inviolate establishments and
agents without reaction. The inevitable ramifications of such .
official acknowledgements would complicate and impair the
relations of even long-standing allies, much less those of former
enemies or neutrals. Uncertainties in this arena may adversely
affect evolving relationships in others. When the relationships
in question are in a state of evolution, such as those between
Russia and the United States, the impact of such a disclosure may
prove especially harmful. ny

, Second, if we declassify today investigative targeting
and surveillance of foreign establishments, officials, and
agents, we may not under prevailing classification principles
keep classified the same information tomorrow. Thus, even though
the consequences of a seemingly innocuous disclosure may be well
understood in a particular context, assessing their impact from

all other relevant perspectives is difficult at best. If, for
example, we declassify our targeting of Soviet officials in this
instance, then all other surveillance of the same officials in

disclosure would Compromise foreign relations. Put differently,
once we discard the policy against officially acknowledging our
investigation of foreign establishments and agents, we can no
longer use it to justify withholding sensitive information. Just
as importantly, once the policy is breached, we may not be able
to use it to shield our investigation of other countries which we
target. for surveillance. The same issue, for example, canbe
expected to arise with regard to our investigatj of other

membe of the former Soviet. block, Cuba, [France Venezuela, C5)
Tsrael,| and a large number of other nation ° 3d :

We are not alone in maintaining this posture. To our
knowledge, no other country acknowledges targeting, monitoring,
or investigating the establishments or officials of foreign
countries within their territory or elsewhere. For these
reasons, then, the State Department seeks to maintain our
traditional policy of not officially acknowledging our
investigation of Soviet establishments and officials by
protecting the information in question. We have agreed to
_advance this position on their behalf. (

Conclusion

Documents Which the FBI Seeks to Protect

Document 10290 is entitled "Funds Transmitted to
Residents of Russia." of this two-page document, the FBI seeks
to postpone disclosure of a portion of one sentence comprised of
14 words: “accounts would reveal the Bureau's interest in the
bank accounts of a foreign government." The government in
question is Russia, or placed in historical context, the Soviet
Union. The remainder of the document pertains to Mrs. Marguerite
Oswald, mother of Lee Harvey Oswald and the remitter of the
ENN and the Bureau's efforts to locate and interview her. _

Documents 10017 and 10052 describe the comparison of
the serial numbers of money found on Jack Ruby at the time of his
arrest with the serial numbers of money known to have been issued
to the Soviet establishments in New York and Washington. We seek
to postpone disclosure of words and symbols that show our
interest in and ability to track money issued to the Soviets.

In executing its law enforcement and counter-
intelligence missions, the FBI employs a wide variety of
investigative techniques and procedures. Some of these methods
are widely known. That we implement wiretaps to gather
information, for example, is hardly a surprise. How, when,
where, and under what circumstances we make such electronic
interceptions, are, however, closely guarded secrets. Similarly,
that we often attempt to "follow the money" through analysis of
financial records may be intuitive but how, when, and why we do
so are matters the disclosure of which may seriously erode our
| ability to carry out analogous operations in the future.

j ; Further, if the target of such activity is a foreign nation,
disclosure of the activity's existence will inevitably prejudice
foreign relations. (U)

targets is changed for any country's establishment or
officials, all coverages on the establishment or
officials, as well as cases opened on persons who
contacted the establishment or officials will also be
declassified for foreign relations reasons. How
DOJ/DRC will handle these matters under Executive Order
12958 is uncertain since no case history has been
established yet. It appears, at present, that the DRC
will protect the technical coverages, lookouts and mail
covers by allowing classification under the "method"
exemption. The DRC has classified several
investigations using the foreign relations and method
exemptions. To date, no foreign relations exemption
has been declassified, but two on the former Soviet
Union are being referred to USDS. If the investigation
is declassified, any telephone calls received at the
establishment or by the officials would be
declassified; however, much of the information would
still be protected under FOIA guidelines. That would
not protect the fact of the technical coverage nor the
target. (Q(u)

The Honorable William J - Clinton
President of the United states
Washington, D.c.

Dear Mr. President: _

For the reasons set forth in detail in the enclosure,
this letter requests, on behalf of the Federal Bureau of 7
Investigation and the State Department, that you exercise your
authority, under Section 9(d) of the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, to postpone public
disclosure of portions of eight documents ordered released by the
Assassination Records Review Board. (U) :

Consistent with the spirit of the Act, the FBI has
cooperated extensively with the Board and made the broadest
disclosure of documents in our history. Over 600,000 pages of
material have been transferred to the National Archives, and we
are working to transfer another 250,000. We have withheld very
little. Nonetheless, when vital national interests would be
compromised by the release of certain information we have asked
the Board to postpone disclosure. Unfortunately, in this
instance the Board has refused to accede to our request. (U)

Disclosure of four of the documents in question would
reveal investigative or surveillance techniques used to gather
important information from a foreign country. Disclosure of this
material would compromise those techniques and impair foreign
relations with the concerned country. That country and others in
which we have investigative interests will quickly take
countermeasures once they realize the significance of the

The Department of State agrees with the FBI's recommendation
to not release documents related to the assassination of President
Kennedy if they could constitute acknowledgement of investigations
of foreign diplomatic officials and establishments in the United
States. It is the Department's opinion that disclosure of these
counter-intelligence investigations could have a significant
adverse effect on US foreign relations. (S)
