and advised that the only relation he had with the subject

Nubes Number 2 is 2-64-87. The only~ persons cyrrently
in residence at this location are servants Si

It is noted that subject's attorney, JORGE
CASTILLO Z.’, has petitioned the Mexican Government to
review their decision not to grant subject immigrant status
in Mexico. He denies that subject has any relation with
the underworld and claims that, although he formerly was
a part-owner of gambling casinos, he has been retired since ,
1950. He claimed that since that time subject has been J
persecuted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
contended that subject could not be a criminal because
he has been residing in the United States and has not C
been arrested by the Federai Bureau of Investigation for' uf
any crimes. He claimed that subject had not returned to —
Mexico since he was requested to leave in October of 1986

Apparently, based on the inquirées being made
in Cuernavaca, CASTILLO contacted inspectors of Mexican
Immigration to inquire the basis for these inquiries.
He was asked subject's whereabouts, and claimed he did not
know. He at first indicated that he believed subject was
traveling at unknown localities in Europe, but subsequently
hinted that subject was. in Miami, Florida.

It is noted that most Mexico City - Miami flights
go through Mexican Customs and Immigration Inspection at
‘Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, and that information previously ZA,
reported indicated that subject had been seen in Merida.
Sources have indicated that Merida is notorious:-for the |
¢ ‘ (corruption in its Immigration and Customs. inspections.
