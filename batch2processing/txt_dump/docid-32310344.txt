. CG 92-3262 >

On August 19, 1973, CG T-1 stated that he has
been in contact with IRV WEINER and was assured by WEINER that
WEINER's present difficulty with the Federal government is
going to be handled in the proper fashion and“that he, WEINER, ‘
‘is apparently not worried about it. CG T-1l advised it is
possible to interpret WEINER's remarks in a number of ways;
however, CG T-1 feels that WEINER really was telling him that
"the fix is in" and that WEINER had made some kind of a deal
which would enable him to survive aniiintensive Federal Grand
Jury investigation into a Central. States -Teamsters Union Pen-
sion Fund loan to a plastics firm partly owned by WEINER
in Deming, New Mexico. According to CG T-l, WEINER is
receiving legal representation in this matter from Attorney
ALBERT JENNER, who, WEINER states, is close to United :
State's Attorney JAMES THOMPSON. :
