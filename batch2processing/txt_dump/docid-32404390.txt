Dear Chuck,

Your welcome phone call Stirred.a. lot of dead (or almost
dead) embers of memory. First, as I reflect on it, there was
no complete record of all: the documents that. the Church Comn-
ittee saw. I think that there would be records in transmittal -
letters of what was sent (in whatever records are left from
Seymour Bolten's staff —~ over which I held a temporary role
while he was recovering from his heaert atack).

. My recollection (which can be in error) was that the
different Church staffers who came out to the agency did
their own thing their own way. When they wanted some document
it was always sanitized and they carried it away. I can,
on reflection, can think of instances when they saw Pppaper
in which I was involved.

Senator Baker (an attractive, talented and highly regard-
ed legislator) did a hatchet job on CIA when he was Nixon's
personal representative on Senator Ervin's Watergate Committee.
He brought up from Tennessee a man who eventually became his
successor, who did it. They published a "report" in early

likelihoods that CIA was involved in the Watergate break-in.The
CIA IG conducted an extensive inquiry into all manner of

rumors and questions that had been raised. Colby did a first
run, replying to the so-called “Baker Report." As I fretted
about it, Seymour Bolten and I did a later 70+ page comment

on Baker's report. Later, when the Church Committee came on

to this old man's aging memory) came to the IG's office.

I said I wouldn't give him access to our Watergate file

(I. recall as some two safes full) until he. had read the
Bolten-Breckinridge critique of the so-called Baker report.
In that case they saw our paper as well as the IG "Watergate
Files" and an unfinished paper being done by. John Richards
when he underwent surgery, from which he didn't recover. I
tell some of that story in my "CIA and the Cold War" pages
170-172, 182-184, 225-226.

Anyway, the Church staffers saw the paper Seymour and
Idid, as well as the IG file, and the uncompleted draft
done by John Richards. T don't know how one can retrieve
those records, much less that they were seen by the Church
people.

Anne Karalekas, an impressive young lady, was the
professional historian on the Church staff, and I recall
that she got into CIA's history shop. She saw just about
everything. they had produced, eventually doing a book
on CIA that I recall was well received. Without looking
now I think some of her work will appear in the Church
report. But she saw a lot of that material.

You will recall the dramatic exaggerations about
MHCHAOS, which some Church people wanted to be seen as
proof that CIA conducted massive surveillance inside the
U.S. In fact. CHAOS was a foreign CI program, which is
discussed in my "CIA and the Cold War,” pages 164-166,
202-206. Anyway, the Church people saw the "Eyes Only"

IG report on CHAOS, where ever it may reside (probably at
least among the papers on the EUR inspection in 1972).

I suspect that rather than a formal record center
the Church people, for the most part asked to take papers
that seemed relevant. to whatever issue they pursued as of
a moment, and carried it away with them (or had it sent
to them -- hence the above mention of transmittal letters).
You mentioned seeing Church staffers’ notes; would any such
papers ‘accompany them?

That's the best 2nd thoughts can produce after all
these years. If more occurs to me I'll try to summarize
it if it seems worth while.

'Twas good to talk with you. Good Luck

Best wishes,
