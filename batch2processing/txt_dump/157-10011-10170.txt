SUBJECT: VISIT TO THE CIA AGENCY, LANGLEY S

Bill Bader and Elliot Maxwell were at the Central

Intelligence Agency from roughly 11:00 a.m. until 2;00 p-m.

on April 10, 1975. While there we met with John Clarke,

Harriet Mowitt, Lyle Miller of the office of the General
Counsel, and Lewis Elder, historian for the CIA.
We reviewed with Lewis Elder a list of historical

studies now in his custody. Attached is a jist of the

historical studies and other materials which we requested

pursuant to our agreement with John Clarke that requests
made while at the Agency would be treated as formal requests
of the Committee. ,

It did not seem profitable to ask that the Agency provide
all of the historical studies which were listed. We chose
works because they dealt with either an overview of the
Agency, or a particular Directorate, oF they provided inform-
ation about policies and practices with which the Committee
may be concerned. Some reliance was placed on Mr. Elder's
suggestions as to the quality of the work and the value of the
information which it provided. Elder cautioned us to be
somewhat sceptical about a number of the studies, as the

@ right te ask for other studies later. These include the

1. A 17- -volume history of the Office of Special Activities,

 

(the U-2 project).

2, A study of personnel records and- reports.

3. A study of security programs of the CIA: the Domestic
Field Office. .

4. <A study of Western European operations directed against
Cuba. .

5. A history of Cuban refugee exploitation.

It is not clear how soon we will receive the material, or
if we will receive it at all. Elder suggested that there were

pstantial third-agency questions involved; for instance, the
study of the U-2 would require approval from numerous govern-.
ment agencies as well as seventeen foreign governments.

Elliot also met with Lyle Miller of the General Counsel's
staff about the material provided in response to the Committee's
‘request for comments on. proposed legislation. The material
provided included comments on legislation proposed in.v1974,
plus a ‘comment on PL 90-331, which allows the Director of the
Secret Service to request support from other agencies of the

Government. Elliot indicated to Mr. Miller that the lack of

material on other legislation in other years was unacceptable.

In the first instance, ali of the specified material will
