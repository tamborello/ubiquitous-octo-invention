Specific records sought include agency interpretations of the

We can search for information responsive to your request.
With respect to your request for a fee waiver, we have reviewed
your request and have determined that the information you seek
from Agency files would contribute significantly to the public
understanding of the operations and activities of the United
States Government. Therefore, your request for a fee waiver
has been granted.

Accordingly, we have accepted your request which will be
Processed in accordance with the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552, as
amended, and the CIA Information Act, 50 U.S.C. § 431. our
search will be for documents in existence as of and through the
Gate of this acceptance letter.

The heavy volume of FOIA requests received by the Agency
has created delays in processing. Since we cannot respond
within the 10 working days stipulated by the Act, you have the

right to consider this as a denial and may appeal to the CIA
Information Review Committee. It would seem more reasonable,
however, to have us continue processing your request and respond
aS soon aS we can. You can appeal any denial of records at that
time. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we will assume that
you agree, and we will proceed on this basis.

— Lanthe, subject request "is “ror “ary records pertain?
“‘¢o™ithe Preeident’ John F. ‘Kennedy Assassination en pseseae Ree”
of 1992." Also requested are "agency interpretations of the
Act and any instructions given to agency employees on
implementation of the Act."

2. As far as HRG is concerned, we are processing
relevant Agency records under the Act for release to the
National Archives. More than 125,000 pages have already
been released to the Archives, where they are available to
the public. We are applying the JFK Assassinations Records
Act in determining what information is to be released.
Section 6 of the Act provides the standards for our
recommendations as to what information should be withheld.

3. Beyond the Act, there is no formal HRG file of
instructions on implementing the Assassinations Records Act.
Guidance is generally given orally to HRG officers. In
addition, we use informal, internal notes to indicate that
certain names or other specific information may or may not
be released.
