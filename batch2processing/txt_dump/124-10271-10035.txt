Long to Gebhardt Memo oo!
Re: Alleged tapping of telephone of. eee
U. S. Senator Howard Baker

 

Gibson advised that during the course of a normal
/working day two or three men usually enter and work in the.
| Sub— leased SCI space. They stay during the course of an
fentire day without leaving the space and do not seem to
hconduct business in a normal manner. An unidentified
| friend - ‘of Gibson's overheard individuals in the space,

i allegedly leased by DEA, discussing "tapes." Based on the’ oS

above information and based on Gibson's experience with

: wiretapping while employed with the Cobb County., Georgia,

Sheriff's Office, Gibson believes a wiretapping operation.

“was being “conducted in the space allegedly sub-leased by .

DEA from SCI. -

Since it appeared that an ongoing CTA operation ©
was being _compromised and th
our Atlanta Office contacted
(Covert) and.informed him of

 

On 7/12/74, Gibson furnished the following:

Directly above Suite 1109, rented by SCI at
1028 Connecticut Avenue, is a suite located on the. .
twelfth floor, which is utilized as an efficiency apartment.

It is connected to Suite 1109 on the floor below by stairway...

Gibson said the twelfth floor space is actually the space
sub-leased to Conein and that telephone number 785-4514 is.
installed in that space. Conein sub-leased this apartment -—
in March, 1974, and was still being used by Conein as of
7/5/74. mo

Regarding the information above concerning, the
alleged ‘overhearing of discussions concerning "tapes," by

7 alleged DEA employees, Gibson advised this information

was furnished to him by Mr. Steve Van Cleave, a personal
friend of Gibson's and a private investigator from

Atlanta, Georgia. Van Cleave told Gibson that he . oo.
visited SCI offices on a recent unrecalled date. Van Cleave
was told by Werbell that Van Cleave could not stay in the...
offices at that time as Werbell was consulting with a-
client. Van. Cleave told Gibson he then went to the twelfth
floor entryway to SCI offices, the space sub-leased by
Conein, and overheard a conversation through the door —
