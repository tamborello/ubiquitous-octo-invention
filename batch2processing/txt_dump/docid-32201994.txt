(5) On April 28, 1961, we sent a letter to the Attorney General
entitled "The Cuban Situation" in which we outlined five possible measures
short of invasion that could bring about the collapse of the Castro regime;
namely, a total embargo; diplomatic isolation of Cuba; gaapEee@iteben

increased propaganda broadcasts to Cuba; use of
’ responsible anti-Castro refugees to propagandize the masses of people in
Latin America. A copy of this memorandum is attached. If you agree,
we will abstract these five points from the memorandum to the Attorney
General and furnish them to General Lansdale for his assistance.
