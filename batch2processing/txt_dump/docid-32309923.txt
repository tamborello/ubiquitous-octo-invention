"(6) The Bureau is also requested to determine why

policies."
Certain jat: were 1lso furnished by the Department in

‘connection with this reuuest for investigation. Included in this
was a memorandum from WALTER J. SHERIDAN, to JEROME S. ADLERMAN

’ DORFMAN; Teamster Bonding. This memorandum records the ‘results —

mation furnished by WRIGHT relates principally to the Teamster

WRIGHT advised WALTER J. SHERIDAN that sometime in December, 195%,
he was contacted by a man named DON PLETTS, who represented an, Fa .
agency in Miami, Florida. PLETTS told WRIGHT that he had ti: ~
Teanster Bonding business and offered to post a cash collatcral of
 $300,000,. PLETTS had previously contacted JIM HALPERN of the.
United Public Insurance Company of Indianapolis for the same —
purpose. WRIGHT advised that a man named JOHN QUINLAN, woo
was with the Peerless Insurance Company, even quit his job tu go
with PLETTS because PLETTS seemed so certain of getting the Teamster
business.

: Also made available by the Department was 2 copy of a report
made by Compliance Officer CARL N. SCHULTZ on September 1, 1961, at
Chicago, Illinois. SCHULTZ is compliance officer with the Bureau

‘Among other things WRIGHT advised SCHULTZ that he
heard a rumor that IRWIN WEINER got the insurance business
of the Castaways Motel and the Everglades Hotel, both
of whom are recipients of International Brotherhood of
Teamster Pension Fund leans. WRIGHT said that the premiums
on the Everglades co@wid total $1,000,000 and that WEINER got
the business "by just walking in’.

SCHULTZ's report notes that a previotis chronology
shows that WEINER was at the Atlanta Cabana and that CHARLES W.

“BRAY, who was connected with the Federal Casualty Company,

‘Chicago, Illinois, telephoned the General Oglethorpe for

a regervation.

The following memorandum with respect to ALLEN and
MARILYNNE DORFMAN and PAUL.and ROSE DORFMAN and their associates
was also furnished by the Department in connection with the
requested investigation. This memorandum is set forth as follows:

"Paul Dorfman and Rose Dorfman and their son, Allen, have
long been alleged to be the liaison between James R. Hoffa and
Chicago racketeers. They have reportedly been the source of
large sums of money for Hoffa. The McClellan Committee disclosed

‘that the Dorfmans had obtained millions of dollars in commissions from

Teamster insurance programs. Since the McClellan investigations, much
of the Dorfmans' activity has been conducted through ‘front’ :
organizations operated by Dorfman associates. Their principal associ-
ates are Irwin R. Weiner, Sol C. Schwartz, Irving R. Nemerov, Bernard
N. Nemerov, RosS Miller and Theodore Shulman.

"Ross Miller and Ted Shulman allegedly *front' for the
Dorfmans in the control of the Dunes and Riviera Hotels an Las Vegas.

"The Nemerovs allegedly represented Dorfman interests in
Trans~Continental Life. Insurance Co. incorporated in Illinois in

June 1958 and subsequently sold to Spencer Austrian. Presently the
Nemerovs run the California Life Insurance Co. of Oakland, California

DETAILS: AT CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

This investigation is predicated upon a request
for investigation contained in a memorandum of Assistant
Attorney’ General HERBERT J. MILLER, JR., Criminal Division,
Department of Justice, dated October 15, 1962.

The memorandum requesting this investigation is
set forth as follows:

,

"Reports have been received that Allen Dorfman and

Irvin Weiner with no apparent effort have obtained the insurance

and bonding business connected with hotels, motels and other
businesses which have been recipients of loans from the Central
states Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund. Allegedly,
the insurance is going through local agencies but the Dorfman
group is receiving the commissions.

"Stanley Mallin of the Atlanta Cabana Motor Hotel,
Atlanta, Georgia, said Dorfman got the insurance business
through Haas and Dodd Co. of Atlanta; that Haas invested $20,000
in the Atlanta Cabana and in return wrote a $500,000 poli-. ar :
Mallin and Jay Sarno.

 

"Elliot L. Haas and Dodd Insurance Brokers, Atlanta,
Georgia, was interviewed by the Eureau in relation to his
activities with the Atlanta and Dallas Cabana. Haas stated that
he got a small policy from the Atlanta Cabana but the nremisies
are very nominal. He also said that because of construction
investments he made in the Dallas Cabana, he was given the
opportunity to write $500,000 in life policies on Sarno and Mallin<
iecords at Republic National Life of Dallas, Texas, show Hass
placed business with Cambridge Insurance Agency, General Agents
for Republic, and earned a commission in excess of $2,000.
(There is a Republic National Life check dated May 26, 1960, to

‘Elliot L. Haas for $2,115.31). Cambridge earned the overwrite

on the Sarno-Mallin life policies according to a report of
Carl Schultz C/O Bureau of Labor Management Reports, Chicago.

"Republic's files indicate that on April 20, 1960,
Republic National Life advised Cambridge that they were splitting
the commissions between Elliot Haas of Atlanta and Cambridge on
policies #187239 and #187240 written on Stanley Mallin and Jay
Sarno. .

"Sol Schwartz is in frequent telephone communication
with Charles Griffin, Raymond Nelson and "Gene" Willage at
TR 3-6581, Atlanta, Georgia. It is not known whether this
has any relationship to the Atlanta Cabana insurance. |

"According to Frank Wright, President of United
Bonding Co., Indianapolis, Indiana, Irving Weiner picked
up, the insurance business (with possIbIé premiums of $1,000,000)
for the Castaways Motel, Miami Beach, Florida. Wright also .
said that Weiner had obtained the insurance vor the Everglades
Hotel in Miami. The Atlanta Cabana Motor Hotel, the Castaways
Motel and the Everglades Hotel in Miami all received loans
from the Pension Fund.

"It is requested that the Bureau interview Frank Wright,
President of United Bonding Co., Indianapolis, Indiana, concerning
his. knowledge of the arrangement whereby insurance and bonding
furnished relative to these Pension Fund loans were acquired
by the Dorfmans and to.concuct an investigation to determine the
following relative to the above mentioned loans by the Teamsters
Pension Fund:

t

"(1) what agencies and underwriting companies are
- involved;

"(2) what policies have been taken;

"(3) what commissions have been paid;

"(4) to whom.

"(5) Interviews are requested with local insurance
and bonding agents to determine whether they have been approached
with "kickback". proposals.
