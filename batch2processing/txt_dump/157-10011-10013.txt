OCCURRENCE? In discussing the possible methods of accomplishing the mission, Sam -
Gold suggested that they not resort to firearms, but ‘Hat“1f he could be fumished with ‘
some type of potent pill that could be placed in Castro's food or drink. Sam indicated —
that he ha@ a prospective nominee in the person of Juan Orta, a Cuban official, who had
been receiving back payments from the gambling interests who still had access to Castro,
and was in a financial bind. Cornelius Roosevelt, Chief, TSD was consulted and assigned

jo develop a pill that had the elements of rapid solubility, high
éthal content, and Tittle or no traceability. .Six of these.items were produced-and

 

 

 

after being checked out for their effectiveness by Dr. Edward M. Gunn, ‘three pills were
ultimately turned over to Sam for the mission. Neither TSD nor Dr. Gunn was briefed on
