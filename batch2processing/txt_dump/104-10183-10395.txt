- 9. Per @ELW223055, 11 May 1966 (not to Gsitzerland) AMWHIP/2
was not given any specific facts about Josef Wilhelm FROTZ. He was :
asked if he had seen FROTZ again and said yes. He met FROTZ recently
(about 23 May 1966) at tho Hilton Hotel. FROTZ aaid he had been very
busy pos expected soos to have time for a deal if AMWHIP/2 is inter-
ested?"Xt seems that FHOTZ's uncle is a bishop in Cermany (as report
ed in @OKE39420, 22 March 1966), The Catholic church is ‘engared in
smu,¢liny valuable art objects out of Bunsary (and perhaps other
Zuropean satellites, thou AMWHIP/2 does not know the latter as a
fact) in order to reaise money. FHOTZ gets these objects from hia
uncle and sell@ them, actually or ostensibly for the church.
AMHHIP/2 would like to pet into the act, which he believes ia lucra-
tive. Ne explained that FROTZ has on deposit in a bank in Switzerlan
.4 g0ld-colored or gold-plated statue weijhing about three kilos and
“priced at about. 25, 000 Sywies france. The. statue came from Ruagary.
_AMOHIP/2 thinks he has a buyer, AMWHIP/2 had taken the precaution
“of checkiny with a Corman credit rating outfit in Germany, however,
and had learned that FaOTé had twice been charred with passing bad
checks. To AMWHIP/2's direct request, BUNCE said only that FROTZ
ig an Bast-¥est trader who seemg to have somcthing of a reputation
tor fraud, AMWHIP/S wald that he would lixe to try to do business
with FROTZ, both berause he may be involved in matters of sone
intelli; ence intercat ‘amt because he thinks that he (A/2) could thus
eake some money, A“2 nav uo real daner in the association, now that
he has been warned and 2" eyoa are open.

2. AMWHIP/2 was told that we should like to maintain contact
with him after BUNCE leaves Hone, but that the person who would be
in touch with him was not yet on the scene. Aiter some hesitation
he said that he was willine to meet a successor on two conditions.
The first was that he woul e handled by the successor as he has
been handled in the past /& tation) Comment: AMWHIP/2 meant that
he was willing to continue to provide information on the present
basis ~ 1.e., that he ia unpaid, that his cooperation is voluntary,
aod that he will not be required to engage in activity which could
endanger his security or business.) The second condition wag that.
he would continue to be handled by. a genior perron, because for
security reasons he wants knowledse of ‘his contact to be as tirhtly
restricted as possible!*%@tatiod)Comment: AMWHIP/2 has no know-
ledce, of course, of BUNCE's position but has always assumed that
it is important.) AMWHIP/2 was assured that both conditions would

be met.
