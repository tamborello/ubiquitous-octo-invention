[____}aid that he had been approached by MEROLA to
pick up the money. He said he declined such offer.

Former MM°722-C said he did not learn any details
as to the exact dates or places of the alleged kidnapings of
CATENA and RAYMOND. He continued that it is very unlikely
he will learn any further such details, as he declined to
participate by picking up the pay off money.

So Source advised that above information undoubtedly
is known to only three or four individuals ther than himself
and any utilization or dissemination of this information would
without question seriously jeopardize his personal safety and
even his life. Source advised that for his own personal wel-
fare and safety he intends to contact both CATENA and RAYMOND
in the very near future and advise each of them of MEROLA's-
plans and intentions with respect to these alleged kidnapings
and shakedowns. .

The Bureau is aware from previous correspondence
volved in a major jewel theft in the Miami area previously,

and MEROLA confided in Departmental Attorney WILLIAM KENNEY,
Miami;-of their participation in the same.

that JOE MEROLA and MIKE SWIATEK, mentioned above, were in- \

By previous correspondence captioned "HENRY HARVEY
HERMAN = VICTIM; KIDNAPING," furnished to the Bureau by Miami

_ teletype dated January 11, 1961, HERMAN was the victim of a

shakedown kidnaping in the Miami ‘area. Continued reports
have been received and reported to the Bureau indicating other
similar shakedown kidnapings. By teletype dated July 26, 1961,

captioned "m[ jc ," the Bureau was advised of a.contemplated. -

shakedown kidnaping on the part, of MEROLA.

OTHER 4

As the Bureau is aware, MEROLA and the informant in
this matter,[ ___~—~~—~Sdihaave:: been close associates for many
years. They have been jointly involved in illegal activity in
the past. MEROLA has no visible means of support, however, the
mode of his living is such that he apparently has unlimited funds.
This money could be coming from such shakedown kidnaping activity.

_ No. official complaint has been received concerning a
violation of the Federal law in the previous kidnapings and in-
vestigation and inquiry among informants has failed to reflect
such a violation. -Based upon the information furnished as to
the contemplated action, it does not appear a Federal law would
be broken’in this instance. It is also known that in some of
the past previous alleged kidnapings, which apparently took place
according to informants, the victims have even denied these kid-
mapings for fear of their lives.

The above is submitted for the Bureau's information
and the Bureau will be advised as soon as reports that he
has’ discussed this-matter with both CATENA and RAYMOND. In
view of[ __|nticipated action, it is recommended this in-
formation not be disseminated to local authorities. There is
attached’ a letterhead memorandum for the Bureau's consideration
in disseminating the same tothe Department inasmuch as MEROLA
is known to this office-to be a lose acquaintance and informant
of Departmental Attomey WILL NNEY in Miami. Fhe.
