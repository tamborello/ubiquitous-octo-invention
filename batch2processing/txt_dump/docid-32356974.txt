the following day. On 27 June 1963 RAY returned to Miami

" £rom Washington, went directly to JURE offices. held a meeting,

HW 53294

and said that he “had gained more from his Washington contacts
in the last month than he had in the two previous years. He
later had a conversation with VOLSKY that lasted over a half
hour. On 18 July 1963 RAY .said that .CIA agents are. more
dangerous than.the KENNEDY Administration asthe Administration
will end but CIA‘ agents always stayed and their memory is
longer than that of elephants; they never forget or forgive.
In January 1964 JURE completed plans to send youths to all
Latin American universities to lecture concerning CIA betrayal
of U.S. policy. On 8 January 1964 a source reported that
VOLSKY diverted refugees from contacting or reporting any
information to CIA by informing them that CIA was the enemy

of the Cubans who wanted to fight CASTRO. In 1964 VOLSKY was
a stringer for the Washington Bureau of The Times which is
believed to have been a special SZULC-engineered deal.

8. Other Government Agencies' Knowledge of VOLSKY:

 

a. USIA - VOLSKY was cleared in December 1961 for
‘unlimited purchase order use'! as a writer. (This is the
category of a stringer.) ‘He apparently had no access to
‘classified information.

b. I&NS - In 1965 I§NS requested name checks on
VOLKSY and his son. A SPECIAL - PRIVATE BILL had been
submitted to grant VOLSKY U.S. citizenship. Unfortunately
the CIA response on VOLSKY senior was 'N.D." (no derogatory)

which obviously was not a true statement. VOLSKY

became a naturalized U.S. citizen on 10 April 1969.

c. FBI -- An FBI report of January 1974 re Orlando

BOSCH Avila, indicates that VOLSKY, of the New York

Times, was collecting money from Cuban doctors on

behalf of BOSCH. On 14 August 1974, the Miami Station

provided the Miami FBI Office comprehensive traces on

VOLSKY, in response to a july 1974 FBI request, for

any action the Bureau deemed necessary. Miami Station

advised the FBI that the Agency had not conducted any

investigation, and that the information included in the
trace was in Agency files because at the time of
collection it was considered foreign intelligence.

9. Attached is a comprehensive CI study of VOLSKY pre-
pared by a JMWAVE Station analyst in 1964, from which the
information in this memorandum was taken. The analyst specu-
lated that VOLSKY's knowledge of clandestine methods of opera-

tions, together with his Russian prison. background and.his

_ingenuity as a middleman in U.S. Government/CIA activities,

HW 53294

made him an excellent candidate for a Communist penetration
agent, and that the possibility existed that he might be a
singleton, sleeper, or stringer for the RIS. Further, that if
that theory proved false, VOLSKY violated his USIA position by ’
reporting to JURE and damaging the U.S. and CIA by his propa-

ganda programs.

time in a Russian prison in the 1940's then enlisted in the
Polish Air Force Service under the British Operational Command.
(VOLSKY provided conflicting information concerning this aspect
of his background.) .

2. While in London at the end of WW II VOLSKY developed a
pen pal relationship with a Cuban girl residing in’ Cuba. He
allegedly was discharged from the Polish Air Force Service in
1947 at his own request. Unable to obtain a visa for Cuba, he
obtained one for Ecuador. In transit to Ecuador: he stopped off
in Cuba, obtained permission through friends to remain in Cuba
and within a year married his pen pal girl friend. He reportedly

allowed to leave Cuba because he had a valid U.S. visa in
his passport. . .
3. Upon arrival in Miami on -22 May 1961, VOLSKY visited
Paul BETHEL, a friend and former Press Attache of the U.S.
Embassy in cuba, (rho was a suspected informant for the CASTRO
regine,| At that time BETHEL was in charge of the Miami Office
of USIA and contracted VOLSKY to edit a VOA program. ~ (BETHEL
was employed by JMWAVE Station from October through December
1961fas a writer-analyst for a detailed analysis of the overt
Cuban press, on a trial basis, but was terminated following
a Headquarters assessment that his reports contained nothing
not already available through regular established sources.) |
4. As the result of VOLSKY's cultivation in Cuba of
American journalists, in particular Tad SZULC, VOLSKY had
influence with certain elements of the American press, especially

the New York Times and The Washington Post. VOLSKY and SZULC

 

had a close relationship in Washington and Miami, were in
touch periodically by phone and personally, and conversed in
Polish. VOLSKY was a source of information for SZULC and
evidently influenced his thinking, manifested in a book written
by SZULC entitled The Cuban Invasion -- The Chronicle of a
Disaster, which was particularly critical of CIA, not only
concerning its failure at Playa Giron (Bay of Pigs), but details
of many other aspécts of CIA.

5. In August 1962 SZULC arranged an interview.in Washington
for VOLSKY with Richard N. GOODWIN, advisor to President KENNEDY.

SZULC claimed that he had had a standing invitation for direct

 

AW 53294 DocId:32356974 Page 3
HW 53294

contact with President KENNEDY and others in the White House
on Cuban matters sirice November 1961. During the missile
crisis, in October 1962, VOLSKY had contact with Major Manuel
PINEIRO Losada, Chief of the DGI, the Cuban external service.
6. In late 1962 VOLSKY devised a plan to split the
CASTRO regime. SZULC got the State Department and the White
House to buy it, and it was referred to CIA for consideration.
Because SZULC's opinions carried wéight with the Administration
he sat in on State/CIA meetings concerning the plan. His
influence is believed to be the primary reason the plan was so
quickly adopted by CIA. In 1963, a State Department official
in Miami was a frequent visitor of VOLSKY and kept him informed
of State Department affairs.
7. VOLSKY's contacts in Miami included a Raul CHIBAS
Rivas, member of the executive committee of JURE (Junta
Revolucionaria Cubana -- Cuban Revolutionary Junta) a Cuban exile

organization. (CHIBAS, an early idol of Fidel CASTRO, defected

‘to the U.S. in 1960) and was suspected by the FBI of being a

CASTRO plant in the v.s.3f In March 1963 JURE created an intelli-
gence group to infiltrate agencies of the. U.S. Government. A
JURE official, named Jose AGUIAR, was making a list of CIA
agents and their assigned tasks for JURE files and VOLSKY
assisted him. On 6 June 1963 the head of JURE arrived in Miami
from Puerto Rico, contacted CISNEROS of the executive board

of JURE, and ordered that no further attacks be made on the

U.S. Government as he was to talk to Robert KENNEDY in Washington
