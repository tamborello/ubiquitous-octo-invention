 

   

Mr. Tolson

I told Bugas that, in view of Bundy's attitude, it appeared
rather doubtful concerning the advisability of our going further
in this matter. Bugas stated he realized this; however, he wanted
to express again the importance of this matter to the Ford Motor
Company, He stated he did not know Bundy; however, Bundy had
apparently been rather snobbish in dealing with the Ford people.
He explained that when Bundy first took this job, Bundy had been
invited to Detroit to meet Henry Ford III and the top people of
the company. At that time Bundy was point-blank advised that he
should be careful in administering the Ford Foundation, inasmuch
as this Foundation had caused serious harm to the sales of the Ford
Motor Company. Bundy allegedly stuck his nose in the air and
Astated "I have a social responsibility to fulfill."

— oe

Mr. Bugas once again stated that any liaison between the
\Ford Foundation and Martin Luther King would "set his company back
to beat hell. He asked again that wa consider contacting Bundy

directly and stated he would appreciate knowing of any action
taken in this regard.

ACTION: : |
; I personally feel that Bundy is of the psuedo-intellectual, ,
Ivy League group’that has little respect for the FBI. He was ;
friendly on the surface while at the White House and I met him
frequently. Under the circumstances, it appears rather doubtful
-that contact with him by the FBI will convince him one way or
another. It is, therefore, recommended that I advise Mr. Bugas
that, while we appreciate his concern, there is some doubt that
contact by us with Bundy would amount to anything. It will be
suggested to him that he might desire to bring this matter to
Mr. Henry Ford's attention, in the event Mr. Ford desires to attempt
to exercise any control over’Bundy. Mr. Bugas, during our
conversation, noted that Mr. Ford was out of the country at .
present time.

My memorandum to you of 10/25/66 reflected a call to Mr
Bugas, relative to confidentially advising him that McGeorge Bundy,
Perisident, Ford Foundation, had contacted Martin Luther King .)
offering a grant of $3,000,000 to the Southern Christian Leadership’

Conference (SCLC).
He expressed alarm and indicated that,

Mr, Bugas called me back at 11:30 this morning. He stated .
iy

he had contacted Bundy and had asked him for an appointment with
the next several days. Bundy asked why he wanted to see him. 3 S
Bugas replied he-was in receipt of information concerning the \ N
fact that the Ford Roundation:’ wanted to have dealings with the
SCLC. Bundy asked for the source of his'information. Bugas told
him his source did not want to be divulged. Bundy stated under
the circumstances he would refuse to talk to Bugas and would

discuss the matter only with the source. Bundy then asked if

the source was the FBI. Bugas refused to reveal the source and

the conversation was terminated,

Bugas stated he thought Bundy had been rather high~handed
in the conversation; however, he wanted to request that the
Director give serious consideration to an FBI representative
contacting Bundy, inasmuch as this matter represents one of
great importance to the Ford Motor Company. Bugas indicated his
j company had had quite a number of “hard blows" from the Ford
| Foundation over the years and most certainly a liaison between
this foundation and Martin Luther King would be a serious blow

bio the company.

SECURITY MATTER - 6 APY
; ha’

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I called
John Bugas of the Ford Motor Company at 4:15 p.m., 10/25/66,
and briefed him generally regarding the background of Martin
Luther King as well as the fact that McGeorge Bundy, President,
Ford Foundation, had been in touch with King relative to
offering a sizeable grant to the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference from the Ford Foundation.

Mr. Bugas informed me that he was very grateful for
|the Director having me brief him concerning this matter. He
stated he would personally contact Bundy in an effort to put
a stop to King receiving any funds from the Ford Foundation.
ie advised that the Ford Motor Company had little control
over the Ford Foundation yet the Ford Motor Company was always
glad to receive information which could be of service in guiding
the activities of the Ford Foundation.

, ir. Bugas also brought up the fact that I had recently

called him at the Director's instructions, relative to indicating
that the Ford Motor Company was about to enter into 2 contract be
with officials of a company in Mexico who were deeply involved at
with Communists. He stated he had put a halt to this contract -

and that his company was very grateful to the Director and the

FBI for receiving such information in sufficient time to cancel
contract negotiations,

Mr. Bugas asked that his best regards be given to vou
and the Director. -

if WE BOE
/ BACKGROUND: On 10/19/66, AT_1387-S.advised that Martin Luther
King, Jr., President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
had recently met with McGeorge Bundy, Director of the Ford
Foundation. At this meeting, Bundy, on behalf of the Ford
foundation, offered King's organizationa grant of three
i million dollars. Bundy explained that the Ford Foundation
is extremely interested in various programs of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference. Also, the Ford Foundation
is sympathetic with the financial problems of the Southern
| Christian Leadership Conference. According to the source,
i ythe only concern of King and his associates is that if they
accept this grant, whether the Furd Foundation Will cxuervcise
control over the policies and operations of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference. We do not know at this time
if the Ford Foundation has made this grant.

 

indicating that King and his group are in need of financial
support. This contact with the Ford Foundation would un-
doubtedly be of great assistameto him at this particular
time,

and that if the proper officials of the Ford Foundation
were briefed concerning them, this might preclude any

Re: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR,

Harry Wachtel's name appeared as an active member of
the National” Lawyers Guild in December, 1949, according
to a confidential source. The National Lawyers Guild
has been cited as a communist front by the House
Committee on Un-American Activities. It should be noted
that Wachtel is a New York City attorney. Another
confidential source advised in March, 1944, his name
appeared on a list of names, significance not known,
maintained at the Communist Party Headquarters of Kings
, County, Brooklyn, New York. Regarding Wachtel's wife,
Leonora, a confidential source advised in March, 1944,
that she was a newly elected officer of the Bath Beach
Club of the Kings County Communist Party, Brooklyn,
New ‘York,

Bayard Rustin, during the early 1940's was a
member of the Young Communist League, an organization
which has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order- 16450. The records of this Rureants Identification
Division contain the following arrest record for ~
Bayard Rustin: On 1/12/44 he was arrested for viola-
tion of the Selective Service Act and on 2/17/44
received a sentence of three years. On 9/15/48 he
was arrested in New York City on a disorderly conduct
charge and was sentenced to fifteen days. On 1/21/53
he was arrested in Pasadena, California, for offering
to engage in an act of sex perversion of a homosexual
nature, which he admitted and for which he was
. sentenced to serve 60 days.

RECOMMENDATION: In an effort to preclude the possibility of
the Southern Christian Leadership receiving Ford Foundation
funds, it is recommended that a Bureau official be designated
to contact John Bugas, former Special Agent in Charge of the
Detroit Office and presently a vice president of the Ford
Motor Company, concerning the above-set forth facts so that
he might bring them to the attention of whomever he feels
appropriate in either the Ford family or the Ford Foundation.
£ tf. foe nh pfhe CROLL OUR Ade the cbr ebie dato ;
Zp dearvt FR I doubt'this will aééomplish anything. D.

In the event the above recommendation is not approved,
it is recommended that a Bureau official be designated to brief
McGeorge Bundy of the subversive backgrounds of the advisers to |
King. t
