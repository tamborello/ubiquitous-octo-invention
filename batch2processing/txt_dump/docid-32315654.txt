In regards to this office's investigation into allega-
tions regarding PETE LICAVOLI and the range of LICAVOLI's activities
in the numbers business in Detroit, Informant advised specifically
as follows:

The “green sheet" is peculiar to the Detroit numbers
business and’ it has never been distributed in any other city in
the United. States except Detroit, He explained that the "green
sheet" would be useless anyplace but. Detroit because Detroit. is
the only city which gets its winning numbers from daily race results
of various tracks, which are selected, in fact, by PETE LICAVOLI
and "RIP" KOURY. ‘Informant emphasized that LICAVOLI ‘has handled
the "green . sheet" deal and the "service" for almost’ twenty-five

years in the numbers in Detroit and that LICAVOLI has employed
"RIP" KOURY, whom Informant refers to as "The Old Man", as the’
"general. superintendent" of both of these | lucrative ‘operations. .

Informant stated that the "dago numbers houses" ceased
activity in the numbers on Friday, October 25,- 1963, however,
Detroit still received the winning numbers. each ‘day even though
the syndicate "went out of actinn"... He stated further that such
numbers gambling is operated differently thr@ughout the country
and that he knows of no other city which hassuch.a sophisticated
numbers operation as does Detroit. Informant’ said that Toledo,
Ohio uses the daily U.S. Treasury ‘palance to select their winning
‘number; Cleveland uses. stock exchange results; Chicago | has the ,
policy "wheel"; and New York has, what he termed “one ‘in: the
pocket", where "you bet two numbers. and you got four ‘going for
you." Informant, in expanding his comments: about the syndicate
