would rather make guilty pleas rather than stand the cost
of a trial. They are, however, afraid that they might
"get the book thrown at them."

On 8/9/66 JN 10-C advised that he has learned
the crooked gambling equipment which was unearthed as
a result of the FBI raid on the Jack Kregs Manufacturing
Co. at Tulsa, Okla., was actually being manufactured to
“be sent to the various owners of the gambling casinos in
Las Vegas, Nevada. The owners of these various casinos

in Las Vegas had this equipment on order. Furthermore, Vr .
since JACKKRESS appears to be connected with the syndiaate ————
which operates Las Vegas, it was this Las Vegas group \

who hired attordeys JACKMASSERMAN and MIKEXMAROUN eet:
represent KRESS. According to the informant, the main
person responsible for obtaining these attorneys for KRESS

was CAR (CELLO of New Orleans, La. (MARCELLO is the
reported Cosa Nostra boss for the New Orleans, La., area.)

   
  
   

Furthermore, this informant stated he had learned
that both attorneys WASSERMAN and MAROUN had been’
investigating the backgrounds of the two principal government
witnesses, namely MAURIC! OLD and PAUL VICTO WN .

BROWN presently resides in Las Vegas, Nevada

 

This same informant advised that all gambling

on the Mississippi Gulf Coast has been shut down tight as
a result of the recent federal indictments as well as the
passage of the new Alcohol Beverage Control laws for the

' State of Miss. It should be noted that any establishment
which houses gambling will not be permitted to serve liquor
on the premises. Several of the gambling establishments
have completely dismantled their operation and either converted
to a bar. - restaurant operation or have closed their doors
completely. ;

On 8/11/66 JN 238-PC advised that two lawyers
for JACK KRESS, JACK WASSERMAN and MIKE MAROUN, stayed
overnight at the Bel Aire»Motel in Biloxi , Miss. During
‘the time: they were in Biloxi, they were in contact
with KRESS, DONALD LESTER oats, IVANXORRELS, and DEWEY
D'ANGELO, They were possibly in touch with other individuals
also. These attorneys were allegedly planning a defense
to the gambling prosecution itistituted by the -federal

- government. The rumor is that all concerned are worried
about -HARRY BENNETT, whom they feel will "cop out" and
‘ testify against the other defendans.

On 8/23/66 all subjects of the indictment in the
HARRY BENNETT case: appeared for arraignment before the
USDC at Biloxi, Miss. All defendants pled not guilty and
were given periods of 30 to 60 days to file any desired
motions or pleadings. Trial datesin the above cases will
be set for a later date and all subjects were allowed to
. eontinue on their present bond.

On 8/25/66 ROBERT AD TT, son of HARRY

/ BENNETT,.a:Gulfport, Miss., attorney and co-conspirator in .
j the HARRY BENNETT; ET AL case, advised Bureau Agents that
jer had been contacted at Biloxi, Miss., by_JACK

SS and Attorney JACK WASSERMAN, accompanied by
JONES and CARLOS’. MARCELLO of New Orleans, La. La.
According’ to BENNETT, the éonversation with HARRY BENNETT
indicated that the government witnesses, MAURICE ARNOLD i
and PAUL VICTOR BROWN, definitely will not testify for the

government. Furthermore, the only other potential witness
for the government is ROBERT ADAM BENNETT. Attorney
WASSERMAN allegedly told HARRY BENNETT that it would be up
to him to "take care of ROBERT BENNETT." Implying that

if he did not do so, some other action would be taken to
accomplish this.
