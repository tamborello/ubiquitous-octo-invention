ALEX: I°ll talk to him and have him go to JOE and
let JOE send him im. Or, I could send him
te the lawyer, but I’m just trying to
avoid that question if it. came up.
HUMPHREYS: - I don't think it will, but it’s good.
ALEX: We got to get another witness.
HUMPHREYS: Another one We got to get a lot of them!
ALEX: And we got to get them before they get them. |

HUMPHREYS: Yeah. You know who we could get to be a |
nt ’ witness? He'd be a hell of a witness.
ALEX: Who? ,

HUMPHREYS: CLAIR.

The. reference of ALEX to MONAGHAN is probably a
reference to ROBERT F. MOHAGHAN, an Assistant United States
Attorney in Chicago. The reference to CLINTON
is a reference to STANFORD CLINTON, who is an attorney in Chicago,
and who is ome of the attorneys representing ANTHONY ACCARDO in
his pending trial. It is obvious that the conversation:-concerns
the trial of ACCARDO, who has been indicted for fraudulently
charging expenses for the use of his automobile which he claims
he used to sell "Foxhead Fourhundred" beer for the Premium
Beer Sales, Incorporated. It is apparent that ALEX and
HUMPHREYS are concerned with finding witnesses whe will back
up ACCARDO’s claim that-he used the car during the course
of selling "Foxhead Fourbundred.”

 

ve

The Yorkshire referred to is believed to be the
Yorkshire Room Restaurant located at 2842 North Sheridan Road
in Chicago. f :

The reference to STEVE by ALEX midway im the conversation
is probably a reference to STEVE DE KOSTA. It is noted .
that DE KOSTA is ostensibly the owner and manager of the Huckster's
Restaurant in Chicago. According to BCI TURA SATANA, a .
burlesque damcer, who is intimately friendly. with HENRY SUSK
and also well acquainted with GUS ALEX, the Huckster'’s is operated
