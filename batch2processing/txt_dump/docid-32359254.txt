1. On Wednesday, 7 October 1970, I briefed Colonel
L. K. White, Executive Director-Comptroller, on certain ~

over a two year period in his handling of this case. Specifically,

by NOSENKO which subsequently had been followed up by this

confessed their recruitment and use by the Soviets over extensive
periods of time. ;

3. Iexplained further that Subject displayed extremely
poor judgment in the actions he took during the time that
NOSENKO was incarcerated at ISOLATION. On many occasions,

condone Subject's instructions to my people who were guarding
