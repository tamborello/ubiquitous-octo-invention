NOFORN/CONTINUED CONTROL

1956, after which he entered military service, He was released after six
montha as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army Signal Corps. In
his work in Denmark, for a firm doing military construction in Greenland,
ALLEY does not have accegs to classified documents, but he does have access
to unclassified blueprints and other papers and he is in contact with a
mumber ef people working on the Greenland projects.

lh. It appears that ALLEY was the individual through wham ABARCHALIN
came into contact with Marvin KANTOR, inasmuch as ALLEY indicated to ABAR=
CHALIN on 5 November 1959 that he would introduce him to KANTOR that evening,
It 48 believed that on that evening ALLEY and ABARCHALIN walked together to
KANTOR's address but failed to see him, According to official travel records,
KANTOR had left Denmark for the USSR on 25 May 1959. He returned on 10 Septem-
ber 1959, presumably having spent the intervening period in the Soviet Union.

S. On the evening of 16 November 1959, however, ABARCHALIN was observed
entering a local restaurant with ALLEY and KANTOR, ‘The three sat down et a
table with two unidentified foreigners of oriental appearance. All membere of

_ the group apparently kmew each other, since they immediately entered into

rather animated conversation. They also looked at some papers or magasinea,
one of which bore the title, Soviet Film. Later in the evening KANTOR left
the restaurant alone, carrying 4 Newspaper or magazine, and ALLEY and ABAR=
CHALIN left together soon thereafter, ALLEY separating from ABARCHALIN after
a shorv time and returning to his residence alone. The two oriental-looking
foreigners remained in the restaurant and later joined two other men who also
appeared to be foreigners. One of the latter two left the restaurant at about
0080 hours and drove off in a car registered to William VALENCIA, an education
student born on 9 March 1936 in Chicago. The other unidentified foreigner was
a Negro who left the restaurant at 0015 hours.

6. We will forward to you any additional information that may be received
concerning the matters reported above.
