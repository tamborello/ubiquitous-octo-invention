TT “Former NO 1378-C requested that a Special Agent
“this office contact him at Orleans Parish Prison where ~~. 4
the informant is presently confined following conviction Nl
for simple burglary. It is to be noted that this former A] Qe
informant has furnished both reliable and unreliable informa-
tion in Yhe past. He was contacted on 4/13/67 and advised,
that sevgral weeks ago he talked with BUNDY, who is a fellow
te prisoney/ and is the same person who testified that he saw
Loe CLAY L, “SHAW pass money to someone on the Lakefront. BUNDY

that he had been offered a deal by District
Attorney JIM GARRISON if he would testify to a story about
SHAW. According to this source, this conversation allegedly
took place several weeks ago in parish prison prior to the-...
time BUNDY testified. At that time, BUNDY was undecided
what course of action he would pursue, but told the source
and others that he would do anything to get out of his
sentence. BUNDY indicated in so many words without coming
out and stating directly that his testimony was not true

and a story was given to him to tell.
