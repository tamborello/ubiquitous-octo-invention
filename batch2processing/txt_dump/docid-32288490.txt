is an informant of the cai aaa OTHER 4

Division. The situation referred to above could possibl
refer to the recent visit of WILLIAM G. HUNDLEY, Chief O2 _

| Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, who was recently

| in Chicago and could possibly be that person who is referred
to in this conversation as BOBBY KENNEDY. There
is a strong possibility that the reference to furnishing the ,
“President all they got in writing" is probably a reference :
to a recent letterhead memorandum prepared by the Chicago | XK,
Division_containing all information available in that Division
pertaining to the situation surrounding the First Ward S ’

activities. In evaluating this information it has been noted |
that the contacting Agent for this informant has not contacted
him since the preparation of this memorandum and for that
reason there would be no possibility of that information
coming to LIEBERMAN's attention from the Chicago Office.
|

SORRENTINO mentioned in the conversation would be
identical to Judge PASQUALE SORRENTINO, who is also a close '
friend of those persons within the First Ward organization. \

To further substantiate the possibility of information
contained in the above-mentioned memorandum having been leaked
out is the fact that this individual is aware of the Government's

\ interest in the activities of certain judges within the Chicago

; area which information has been maintained in an extremely

{ confidential manner even within the Chicago Division and it

is felt that the only possible way that this information

would be known would be through a leak from another source,

in this instance the office of the USA.

At approximately 4:30 p.m., 12/18/62, the individual
referred to as BILL in my airtel of yesterday, who was engaged
by PAT MARCY to check sthe,phones within the offices of the -
First Ward reappeared/ in MARCY's office, at, which time a

the two individuals. This discussion was held in extremely

low tones and only minor excerpts could be obtained from the
source. From the limited amount of information available

it is. known that this individual advised MARCY that his
telephones are not tapped at any point within the building. .
Again due to the low tones used by BILL, it is pointed out that
the full context of the conversation could not be determined;
however, it isstrongly felt that MARCY received no indication
from this individual of any possible microphone installations
within his offices. At the termination of their conversation
MARCY was overheard to state to this individual that "If I

want any work done I will get in touch with DICK and have

him get in touch with you." This reference to DICK was felt

to be a reference to RICHARD CAIN, presently one of the top
investigative aides of .Cook County Sheriff RICHARD OGILVIE

who is known to be associated with PAT MARCY as per previous
airtels. A pretext telephone call was made to the Sheriff's
Office and a request made to talk to "BILL, DICK CAIN's
partner." It was determined that BILL was not in and under
further pretext it was determined that BILL WITSMAN is. presently
CAIN's number one partner or aide. It is pointed out that
CAIN has a reputation for being an excellent wire tap man and
in fact an article appearing in Chicago newspapers on 12/18/62
indicated that CAIN had recently made a check of phones within
the Sheriff's Office and uncovered six tapped lines within

this building. Chicago continuing to watch this situation
