were made. aware of an IRS informant's identity in connection
with the recent gambling raids by WILLIAM "SCOTCHY" MORRISON,
Albany gambler arrested at these raids, and the source of this
information for the informant.was one JOSEPH MOSHER. It was.
pointed out that the informant’ was supposed to be a young man
driving an older car,

new and. young IRS. Agent as an undercover man whose activities

a fellow bettor.,. HARTNETT advised that SEAMAN had utilized an
old car, participated in the raids, was observed by several

On 6/19/64, AL 3088-C-TE was contacted under cover
of a routine contact, It should be noted that at no time during
this contact with him was any mention made to him of the
information heretofore set forth concerning the alleged meeting
of 6/14/64. During this contact with him, as on every contact
with him, he was asked if FALCONE, MANCUSO, or SAM GRIO had
been in contact with him or if he had seen them. He stated
that they have not been in contact with him and he had not
seen them for at least two months, At this time, inprmant was
queried about: any gambling interests that FALCONE, MANCUSO, and
GRIO might have in the Saratoga Springs, NY,. area, He stated
that back in the 1940's, when he was operating the Brook Club
_ in Saratoga, MANCUSO, FALCONE , and several others whom informant
could not recall. had’ attempted to "muscle in" on DOC FARONE's
gambling interests in Saratoga Springs and had been literally
‘thrown out of Saratoga by FARONE. Informant further volunteered
that FARONE detests MANCUSO and probably would have nothing - .
to do-with MANCUSO so therefore would not become involved with
him in gambling, It should be noted that informant advised
that DOC FARONE was a very good friend of his, stating that
FARONE. backed him financially when informant operated a
restaurant and bar. equipment supply business in Albany, NY.

- During the contact with informant , -he was also asked ©
what the feeling around town was as a result of the IRS gambling
raids, He said that it was common knowledge around Albany
that an elderly man driving an old car was believed’ responsible
by local gamblers for furnishing information to IRS that led
to their arrest. He said that he had learned’ this from JOSEPH
MOSHER, an employee at the State Campus Site, who resides at
35 Holmes Court and employed by the Basic Construction Co. as
a truck driver, that "SCOTCHY" MORRISON was the source of ‘this
information and it was indicated by MORRISON that the local
gamblers are out to "rough up" this elderly man. He knows
nothing about this elderly man and could furnish no information
concerning his identity. The above information was volunteered
and at no time had Agents mentioned MOSHER's name nor the

. alleged meeting in Albany, In addition, informant advised that
