Count. Bichael TOLSTOL

Born: September 10, 1922 Wanscha, Saxony.

Nationality at birth: Russian

Naturalised British Subject: August 19, 1947.

J x 8 Kot

Japmabes, and C Ine TOLSTOI served in the Royal Naval

se ve (Sub-Lieutenant) being commissioned

bs « . He was adversely reported om and his commission

was teriiineted.

He joined the staff cf the Control Commission in

7 rned to the U.K. He entered Austria clandestine-
n Septemter 1947, and was expelled in November 1947
order of the Commander-in-Chief, British Forces in Austrie
j @ there, he appears to have indulged to a considerable
extent in Black Market deals, notably in cigarettes. He
was brought to the U.K. under escort, the Expulsion Order
showing that his deportation was on the ground that his
presence in Austria was detrimental to good order. an
Intelligence Keport from Austria says that there was some
om that while in Austria he was working for the
sub aus, but no firm evidence to support this has ever
been obtained, nor did the circles in which he moved in
Vienna in any way bear out this suspicion.

From a confidential source we know that in
1947 TOLSTOI was in friendly contact with Ivor Agafonov
who was at that time an assistant Naval Attache at the
Soviet Embassy in London, England.

In Bay 1948 a report was received that TOLSTOI
Was engaged in selling arms to both Jews and Arabs. It
Was stated for instance that ne haa already sold 4,000
Beretta machine guns to the frabs, and was in touch with
a Jewish group who had 50,000,000 Swiss francs at their
disposal fer purchasing arms. Certain names were |
mentioned in this report known to us to be in fact
engaged in selling arms to the Jews. -

Later that year he was reported from Switzerland
and Austria as dealing in arms.

he Countess TOLSTOI, who lives near New York
ond gives help to White Russians is an aunt of Michael
TOLSTOI. You will remember that she figured in the
@ase of Badame Kosenkina.
