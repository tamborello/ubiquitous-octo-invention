Attached is a list of members of captioned committee, of which I
am amember. In the past, members of this committee and of the Advisory
Committee to it have all been included on the Special Correspondents List. i
Because ‘of a reorganization of the committee, many in the list are not :
presently on the mailing list. The attached list is appropriately marked and
it is-believed that those not currently on the mailing list should be added.

I have checked files on these individuals and there is no derogatory »,
information which would pzeclude their addition. Adverse information, in files; /
on some which would not preclude their addition to the list is as follows:

-information critical of his judicial temperment and legal ability. Nevertheless Uy)
he was appointed and is currently a District Judge. {

identical with an individual of the same name associated with the Citizens Ay
Councils of Mississippi during the mid 1950's. The Citizens Councils were on
particularly active in the Jackson area and, of course, were designed to NN 4
oppose integration. There is no indication that they engaged in violence such Ni
as did the Ku Klux Klan and there is nothing in our files to indicate that ®
Overstreet was engaged in any unlawful adtivit V7 . j
