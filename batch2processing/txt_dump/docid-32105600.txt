1 A Yes.
2 2 And I don't think I can repeat what you explained to
3 me about che L-22, so maybe you had better repeat that.
4 A. The L-2€ was a special sing
5 been purched py the CIA called the
6 Force owned a number of these air craft. So we provided
9 cover for CIA by giving them Air Force insignia and Air Force
8 designation, the L-28, and Air Force serial numbers. And these
9 aircraft, or at least some of them, were based at Eglin Air
10 || Force Base in Florida. They were at Eglin Air Torce Base
11 because that is where the CIA kept most of its aircraft in the
12 country.
13 rey And how was this mission originally, described to you?
14 A Originally it was one of a number of missions that we
is || were operating over a period of time. But it was one of the
16 few that we operated with L-22's, The people who came over
17 from the Air Division stated that they had a place to land the
18 plane in Cuba on a road, on a small road, and they had a photo-
19 graph of it. And they were going to let two men out there and
20 then fly the plane back with a pilot and copilot to Eglin Air
21 Force Base. And-the men that were being left off would be
22 equipped with a high powered rifle and a telescopic sight.
23 They were Cubans. We never saw them, of course. This is what
DA we were told they were, because we didn 't interfere with who
25 was onthe plane, we simply put the plane in the air. But this

was a normal procedure. And the object of their mission in
Cuba was to go to a building in Havana where one of the men
knew his way around and was pretty sure that he could get into,
and if possible, he would shoot Castro.

a. Did you recall who told you this?

A No, I don't, because we were working every day with
these people. And I think if you had a listing of the Air
Division staff at that date I probably could tell you it was one
of four men, something Like that, a Division of maybe 39 men,
it would have been one of ‘three or four, or two of three’or four}
The thing was, we were doing these things every day, it was not
an odd thing that came up, it was something that we were doing

quite regularly.
. 0. It surprises me that the CIA would describe the
mission to you in this much detail, it doesn't seem consistent
with compartmentation and need-to-know particularly in view of
the sensitive nature of the mission.

A. That is.an awfully good point you are making. In
those days it did, because the. more urgent part of my job was
to brief my boss, the Chief of Staff, Air.Force, and through

him the Secretary, Air Force, or the Secretary of Defense,

or whoever, as required.
