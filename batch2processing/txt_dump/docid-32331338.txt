Enclosed is the original and five copies of LHM concern-

Prt, ing the subject. It does not appear that the CHARLES WHITE,
who holds US Passport Number 1000636, issued 7/8/68, is

jor identical to the subject. Furthermore, he does not have a
current or a former wife named DOROTHY. In addition, the

NYO does not know TOURINE to have visited Italy recently.

It is not necessary for Legat to maintain stop placed
with the Italian police on the subject at this time. In the
event any contemplated travel to Italy:is learned on the part
of the subject, Legat will be immediately alvised, and all
pertinent information will be forwarded.

. Washington Field will check US Passport Number 1000636

5/28/05. It is believed by the NYO that this CHARLES WHITE

WHITZ and the subject have different dates of birth, and
usually the subject in the past has obtained a passport in
the name of CHARLES TOWRINE.
