Memorandum from John A. Hartingh to Mrs. Morris, dated 10/31/95
Re: JFK TASK FORCE a pee

Fs etelsa'— > _.
eae 7. HQ 62-109060-4NR 1244, NAR 124-10027-10059,

identifies Merle Fainsod, Professor of Government and Director of
the Russian Research Center at Harvard University, as an -
established source of the FBI. Fainsod provided minimal
information regarding Priscilla Johnson, a well-known newspaper
woman and author who spent time in Russia. Johnson was of
interest to the FBI in its efforts to interview individuals
possessing knowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald.

per 8. HQ 62-109060-1581, NAR 124-10027-10044, identifies
two Cuban sources of the Chicago Office. Ebelia Echevarria and
Jesus Martinez were ‘described in this document as sources who
provided information concerning the Cuban community.

LF 9. HQ 62-109060-1NR 2321, NAR 124-10030-10093, ~—
identified Jas an informant of the Cincinnati Police OTHER 4

Department who provided information regarding the illegal sale and
possession of automatic weapons. [——]stated a. fear of being
killed in retaliation by those peopI@ with which he associated,
and his identity was protected at his request.

The FBI provided written justifications arguing the
need to protect the individuals listed above. However, the ARRB
supports the position that the information at issue is relevant
and significant to the assassination and that it outweighs any
harm that would be caused to the individuals to be disclosed.

As experienced in the prior appeal to the President, we
are experiencing difficulty meeting the statutory burden of
protecting FBI symbol number informants, PSI’s and PCI’s. it
would be far more difficult, if not impossible to meet that burden
that these nine individuals currently require protection, under
the JFK statute as interpreted by this board. We would have to
determine whether they are alive, locate them and/or their
relatives, interview them for their position on disclosure and
identify specific harms that would result from their disclosure.
If, however, CID and/or NSD recommend appeal, they are requested
to provide their opinion and reasons to the JFK Task Force and OGC
by 11/6/95, as the FBI only has 7 days to appeal upon receipt of
the letter. i ”
