MARCY: ‘ This guy is freezing all your jobs?

PORCARO: Yeah, the dirty (obs). And the guys I have made
in my time. I made........ for Recorder, I
put HODGE for Auditor,

MARCY: He's gonna make it this month I see.
PORCARO: Yeah.

Now, look what's happening. I lost my clout,
I*m out now, but I said don't try to pressure
me just because I'm out now. The world changes,
what's true today may not be true tomorrow.
After all, MOONEY knows what's going on and he
has a way of catching up to these guys. I

was always friendly to JOHN and tried to do
everything I could. This GIROLAMI, he'd rather
see JOHN go to jail than do him a favor. But
if he won't do what they tell him, watch out.

MARCY: I think you're right.

PORCARO: I'm positive. And that (obs) has got everybody
: on the payroll. His brother-in-law came érom
out of town and never worked a precinct. Hes
on for $14,000 a year. But look, try to straighten
this out for me, I don't care how much I get, just
so I get it every two weeks. 500 a month.
You work it out with him, will you?

MARCY: OK, JOE. 2

It is noted that TONY,/GIROLAMI referred to above ~
is the Democratic Ward Committeeman.of the 28th Ward, being
the counterpart of PORCARO in this, respect. The above
conversation brings into foc information furnished by

who is identical tosCG 6498-PC. He has advised
the Agent handling him that®due to the influence of the
FBI over him in recent years he has attempted to slowly but
surely cut the ties of the hoodlums and their associates,
such as D'ARCO and MARCY, with him. He advised that he is
concerned with his actions in this regard due to the fact
that he lives “among them" in a predominantly Italian
neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago and must leave
his wife and child alone frequently at night. He stated that
he has received no direct threats but has been approached by
MARCY who implied that he and his friends are not happy with
GIROLAMI. po —jhas cited several instances where he has

been in recent contact with hoodlums, such as GIANCANA

and HUMPHREYS, and has refused to do their bidding. One of
these recent instances was in November, 1962, when he
refused to support PORCARO for the vacancy which existed
when he left the Aldermanship of the 28th Ward and became
Clerk of the Probate Court. The reference to GIROLAMI's
brother-in-law from out of town is a reference to the
brother of GIROLAMI*s wife, JACK KUBIAK, who is originally
from Niles, Michigan, whom GIROLAMI recently placed on the
payroll of the Illinois Toll Road Commission.

MARCY then telephonically contacted SID KORSHAK
and informed him that he would see him in KORSHAK’s office.

MARCY then contacted Sergeant PAUL QUINN, Secretary
of Police Commissioner ORLANDO W. WILSON, and attemptéd
to place a school crossing guard on the South Side of Chicago.
QUINN apparently informed MARCY that he should contact MATT
DANAHER, Administrative Aid of Mayor DALEY, which MARCY then did.
DANAHER advised that he would instruct the Mayor's Office
to comply with MARCY's wishes and MARCY then recontacted
Sergeant QUINN to so advise him.

MARCY then carried on the following conversation with
Alderman BENJAMIN LEWIS, Negro Alderman from the 24th Ward
of Chicago:

MARCY: Hi, Alderman, What did you do with that guy's
wife, Your (obs) right, he's got the arm going
for him. Let me.tell you something. You might
want the arm going for you sometime and it’1l
be there for you too. Yeah. OK. All right.

OK. Yeah, but you don't do that to good friends,
Alderman. You know what I mean, That's right,
that’s right, that's right. Listen, you're

my friend, I don't want to argue with you. All
right.

MARCY then asked FRED ROTI to obtain the private.
number of FRANK CHESROW which he dialed after receiving it.
He talked to CHESROW as follows:

MARCY: FRANK, PAT MARCY. Give me about five minutes.
CE 6-4434, Call me there, go out and call me.
