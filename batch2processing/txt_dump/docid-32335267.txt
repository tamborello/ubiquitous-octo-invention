ADMINISTRATIVE:

. The lead which was set forth in referenced report
te reinterview Mrs. ELMO HOLLOMAN, 5603 Jackson Street,
Alexandria, La., was not covered inasmuch as subsequent to the
last interview of Mrs. HOLLOMAN on 10/22/64, she wrote a
letter to the Director in which she indicated she was angry

' about being contacted by the FBI. In her letter to the
Director, Mrs. HOLLOMAN stated she joined the “HINUTEMEN"
to see “what they were up to." She indicated that for the
same reason she subscribed to "The Worker". Mrs. HO!
stated that she had not carried out a single assignment
given by the "MINUTEMEN" not because there was anything
at all wrong with this organization but simply because she
did not have the time. She did indicate that she was a
“chapter leader" in the John Birch Society, which she con-
sidered the "proudest assignment of ny life." Even though
Mrs. HOLLOMAN expressed confidence in the Director, it is
felt that nothing worthwhile wou be accomplished by a
reinterview.
