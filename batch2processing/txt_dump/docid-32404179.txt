Memo for the Record

Subject: Carlos Tepedino

 

1. The confusion over release of Tepedino name and
relationship with Agency resulted from a failure to update
guidelines after the release of his name in the IG report.
The guidelines developed during the re-review of the Denied
in Full documents (release Tepedino when linked to Cubela;
protect in other situations) were not incorporated into the
written guidelines. As a result the reviewers who came on
board in the Fall 93 to review the Microfilm continued to
deleted his name in all cases.

Background:

e Tepedino's name and relationship with Cubela and the
Agency appeared in a 1966 Washington Star Article
(attached).

e In response to an HSCA request, his Security File was
made available to HSCA staffers and became part of the
JFK collection.

e In August 1993, documents from his Security File were
sanitized and released to NARA. This release reflected
the guidelines agreed on by HRG, DO and OS for reviewing
os files:

Existence of an Agency file does not confirm an
official relationship with the Agency; if the
individual was of logical interest to the Agency
(Tepedino is Cuban and had contacts in the Castro
governments) and was involved in the assassination
story, documents showing agency interest could be
sanitized and released as long as they did not
officially confirm agency relationship.

e In October 1993, the 1967 IG Report on Anti-Castro
activities was released to NARA. ‘Tepedino's name was
inadvertently released in the section dealing with
Cubela's first contact with the Agency (page attached) .
The IG report in effect confirmed the 1966 newspaper
article and that the released OS documents reflected a
"relationship" with the CIA in the same time frame
addressed by the IG report .¢—

« During the revie f£ the Denied in Full documents in
January 1994, i documents on Tepedino were re-
reviewed. Given what had been previously released,
these documents were no longer fully protectable under
the JFK Act.— All were within the JFK relevant time
frame and £0ur deal specifically with his relationship
with the Agency at the time of the "Cubela operation".

 

 

NOTE:

The OS file is poorly sanitized, and clearly releases
more than intended by the guidelines: Tepedino's name
and alais appear on the iden aid; operational
approval/use as an agent is acknowledged; references to
contact outside the time frame are released; forms arey—
not redacted according to guidelines.
