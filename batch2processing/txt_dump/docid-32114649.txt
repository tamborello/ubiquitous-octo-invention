SUBJECT: Investigation of Lee Harvey, Oswald

1. While serving as Political Officer,

; right, Elena Garro Paz. An intellegent, ‘witt ;
I found Her a very,“useful-if sometimes biased source al-’gossip:

ED :: :

and personal history on significant Mexican personalities: She introduced

‘ my wife and me to many important people in Mexico. She was. also. parti-
cularly knowledgeable about agrarian affairs. A biographic report that

TI prepared on her on May 3, 1966 is attached (Tab A). :

   

   

 

 

2. On one occasion, Miss Garro inadvertently mentioned to me that she
had been at a party with Lee Harvey Oswald and two American companions
when Oswald was in Mexico just before the Kennedy,assassination. The
party had been at the home of her cousin, R Duran. “ The memorandum
of that conversation, dated December 10, 1965,°is attached (Tab B). I
had not read the Warren Report, but I assumed that if Oswald had been
to such a party in Mexico, it would have been well known to the Embassy.
I also knew Miss Garro to be something of a professional anti-communist
who tended to see a communist plot behind any untoward political event.
However, the episode about her being escorted into hiding’ at an obscure
hotel intrigued me. Accordingly, I decided to report the matter in
writing. I gave the memorandum of conversation limited distribution
within the Embassy, and did not send any copies to Washington.

may not have pressed for further investigation, however, for a number of-

: li. If all the allegationg. in. the. attached memoranda were true, they

would not, in themselves,’ .prove that there was a conspiracy to assassinate

“42, Reference is made again to the: biographic report (Tab A) on Elena

Garra. She is hardly an ordinary or. average person. Her strengths and.
weaknesses become exaggerated precisely because she is not. It would

be easy and convenient to sweep this matter under the rug by claiming
that Miss Garro is an unreliable informant since she is emotional,
opinionated, and "artistic." I have been affected at times by that .
temptation, myself. No American official, however, knows her better than
Ido. On the basis of the facts that I have presented, I believe that,
on ‘palance, the matter warrants further investigation.

American publication has at least some knowledge of ‘his story.
