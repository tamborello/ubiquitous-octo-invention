MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT : Termination of Project LIHUFF

so 1. It is requested that the LIHUFF Project be

terminated, effective 30 June 1970.

2. Project LIHUFF covered funds for one agent,

' LIHUFF-1, a U.S. businessman resident in Mexico City
who had served in World War II with U.S, military
intelligence (MIS/X). LIHUFF-1 provided the Mexico |
City Station with access into the right-wing political

‘ groups and the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico.
He also obtained Dunn and Bradstreet reports for the
Station and performed other tasks from time to time.

3. LIHUFF-1 was actually terminated effective
28 February 1970. No funds were expended for the
_ termination, as he was not given a termination payment.
He was paid his salary of $300 per month, plus social -
security contributions, up until the time he was
terminated. During FY 1970 $2,528.41 of LIHUFF Project
funds were expended,

4, There were no known problems or security
risks in connection with the termination. A quitclaim
was not obtained. LIHUFF-1 was advised concerning his
social security benefits derived from his CIA employ-
ment and told to contact the Station should he have
further questions.
