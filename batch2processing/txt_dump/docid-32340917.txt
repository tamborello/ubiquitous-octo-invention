arm of the latter of these two groups and engages in
clandestine activities that are directed supposedly
against "communism". It is "Zero" that recently
assassinated by bombing the Spanish official, whose
assassination has instead been claimed to be the work

of Basque separatists. "Zero" would not involve itself
with any Cuban organizations. BOSCH, incidentally, has
nothing. to do with Spain or "Zero".

ARAUJO is unaware of any Cuban organization
calling itself "C4" and suspects it, is only a name adopted
in connection with some bombing for the purpose of confusing
the authorities. ‘ .

(Mention of "Zero" and "C4" was made during
. the interview in view of the fact a supposed list of
local assassination targets came to light in Los Angeles
shortly after the assassination of RIENTE ang becaus
of recent information attributed to/AL 4120-PSI/ that KU)
the “Frente de Liberacion Nacional bana", "“Accion
Cubana", “Abdala", "Zero" and "C4".whad formed a coalition).
Since ARAUJO moved to the Miami area, "Brigade
2506" in Los Angeles has been led by FULGENCIO GIL.
Another leading member is one (FNU) LAMELAS. GIL may
be characterized as "radical" in the sense of being
impatient towards policies which he feels would be
unlikely to accomplish anything. At least in the past
he seemed to be so disposed. Nevertheless, he has
continued so far as known to head "Brigade 2506" during
a period in which it has become less and less active.

. No group called "Organizacion Cubana" is known
to have ever existed in the Los Angeles area or anywhere
else and would seem to be simply.a general term rather
than the actual name of an organization. However, a
group called "Comandos Accion Cubana" existed in the
Los Angeles area about four years ago; but none of its
members are known to ARAUJO.

The only group in the Los Angeles area that
would be approachable for anything like BOSCH's purposes

is (if it still exists) "Juventud Cubana." This
organization worked with "Plan Torriente" in Los

SECHET)

AT NORTH MIAMI, FLORIDA: In view of the above,
it is suggested that Miami contact ARAUJO, preferably.
through his employment and; attempt to interview him
further in connection with his information, ana iacv¥iew
of his expressed willingness to help ‘in connection with
such matters as "Cuban" bombings, im his past contact with
BOSCH and his apparent access to sources in the Cuban
field in Los Angeles (despite his removal to Miami) as
well as in Miami, to consider him for possible development
in the Cuban field. It should be mentioned that while
his information about "Zero" as stated above could
suggest that he does not believe. it was responsible
for the assassination of TORRIENTE, the-opposite is
in the case. He was asked why "Zero" would wish to
assassinate TORRIENTE and replied he did not-know. The
true import of his information is to assert that "Zero"
is a secret organization and would not involve itself
with any CG _organizationfas suggested by AL 4120-PSI'
information$)His information about "Zero" should not be(U
totally di®tot&nted in view of his family's alleged

‘background in Spain. It is further suggested that he

be specifically asked regarding his statement that
"Comandos Accion Cubana" existed in Los Angeles four

‘years ago, whether it was clandestine or participated

in any ‘anti-communist" activities in the Los Angeles
area and who would be able to furnish additional infor-
mation about it.
