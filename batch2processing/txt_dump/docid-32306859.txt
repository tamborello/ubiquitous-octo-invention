Since the inception of the related investigations pertaining
to the Organized Crime Program one of the primary objectives of
this program was to identify members and positions of leadership.
To this end _ Knowledgeable informants were contacted in all
pertinent field offices. On the whole the informants= supplied
accurate information, which was subsequently verified by
highly confidential sources and by’ member sources but as to the
exact number of LCN members in. the U.S. many diverse numbers
were received. Some of the figures apeared to be unrealistically ‘
-high and much. confusion has arisen.as to the exact number of

_LCN. members. Even member sources are not consistent in their
estimation. As recently as September, 1968, NY 6436-C-TE

(member source) who is an extremely knowledgeable informant was
contacted and opined ttt there were 2,000 members in New York
.City. but. 500 were dead. The NYO can account for over 500 living
members withséveral hundred known dead but it is exceedingly
unlikely’ that the NYO will surpass 700 active members. Therefore,
at this time an attempt should be made to reconcile the exact
membership.

 

i

AS a. point of reference the membership books according to
reliable sources were ‘closed for all families a short time follow-
ing the Appalachian meeting on 11/14/57. It is conceded that in
a few isolated instances, for specific reasons, some members were
admitted, however, the number is relatively insignificant.
Therefore, to come to a determination it will be necessary for . '
all offices to review their AR files md. list all deceased members © |
on a separate list. It is expected that this project can be . ‘
easily completed for inclusion into the next LCN National :
Summary: report in the Fall, 1969.

 

It is believed that by following this procedure, an accurate
determination can be made as to the approximate number of LCN i
members in the U.S. at it's high point in November, 1957.

- Since that time the active membership list would necessarily
decrease primarily because of deaths.

Offices are not necessarily confined to the time of Appalachian
_and should include ‘the names of persons. identified as members
'. ov who died prior to. this time so that a complete deceased list
“will bex ‘compiled.
