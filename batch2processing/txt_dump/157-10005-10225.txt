Mr. Houston. It was a memo of DITEL's that I saw.

I think it was dated after I left. I saw it in draft after-
ward. It had to do, I recall, with operations in the Trust
Territories.

Mr. Wides. TIn-other words, the first category of issue
that I mentioned?

Mr. Houston. Yes.

The SEC, as a result has raised some questions with Justice

29

between our justice and our statutory problems. This is
before Justice now.

Mr. Wides. Is there a file in the OGC office generally
regarding, not necessarily every one, but many of your --
which would contain many or most of OGC contacts with
Administrative agencies over the years?

Mr.Houston. No, because they weren't -- there probably
is a substantial file on relations with Internal Revenue.
But those were to a large part either working out our own
tax equations on our own personnel with cover problems which
you probably know about, or the CAT situation, or Southern
Air. Transport, and not interferring with IRS prosecutions,

although several times we were involved ~~ here is the type of

 

case I guess you are talking about.

What is the fellow out in the Philippines -- I think his

 

~ who had one of the biggest tax assess-
ments made against an individual made against him, I think,

$2 million? And very definitely tried to involve

us in his defense. There was some connection with

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Philippines, you couldn't be in the Philippines without
some connection with them. And yet gave IRS the full in-
formation, and said, don't bother with us, we are not
concerned.

Mr, Wides. What about such things as the contacts with

continue, you said there were three cases that eliminated the

kind of cases which CIA had with Justice, and the referrals,
and you had gone through one. And I wondered if you wanted
to go through the other two.

Mr. Houston. All right.

The second one was quite an interesting one. If I give
it in too much detail, excuse me.

Mr. Maxwell. Off the record.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Maxwell. Back on therecord.

 

Mr. Houston. all of a

that he had with him a considerable sum of money, something

in the nature of $30,000, I can't remember the exact amount.

This was promptly reported, and he disappeared into the blue.

to the[ —_—sfhrough a lawyer that he had written all the

Niarchos' ship captains named Katopodes brought a libel action
I believe it was, against Onassis for some letter he had written
about some activities of Katapodes, I can't remember the
details now.

We didn't know where this was leading. So this was in
the Supreme Court of New York State, and so I went to a fellow
I knew in the U.S. Attorney's office and asked him if he
could keep track of how this suite was developing to see if
it was leading into some of the connections we had, par-
ticularly with Niarchos.

And he got some of the pleadings and some of the pre-
trial evidence --

Mr. Wides. But you don't recall any contacts between

the Agency and the Justice Department resulting in Mr. Yeagley

proceedings in New York growing out --

Mr. Houston. It strikes no valve.

Mr. Wides. Let me ask just one more question in this
area and then we will move on to the document I asked you to

look at before we started.

 

Mr. Maxwell. I have just one other question.
