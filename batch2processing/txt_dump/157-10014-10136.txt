In depth treatment of the assassination question has lengthened

the Committee's schedule but has greatly increased the Comaittee's awareness

of the hard issues it must face in the) months ahead. The Committee intends,

nevertheless, to complete, by February, 1°76, its main. job of undertaking the

first comprehensive review of the intelligence community.

 

A. The Committee's Nandate |
Under Senate Resolution 21, the Committee was instructed to in-

eo og: se gh gg eg aa Pras .
vestigate the full range of governmental intelligence activities and the

 

extent, if any, to which such activities were “illegal, improper or un-
' - : ;
ethical". In -addition to that very broad general mandate, the Committee

: : ek : .
was required by the Senate to investigate, study and make recommendations
. . y
concerning, various specific matters, several of which relate to the assassi-
nation issue.* |
, i

Although the Rockefeller Commission conducted an inquiry into

. | _
reported assassination plots, the Commission declared it was unable, for

[

a variety of reasons, to complete its }inquiry. At the direction of the Presi-

dent, the Executive Branch turned over, to the Select. Committee the work
|

: . i - : . : .
the Commission had done, along .with other docunients relating to assassina-

tions. : }

-* Tor exawple, S. Res: 21 requires the Committee to study and investi-’
gate the following:
the extent and necessity of ~ 4 . covert intelligence activities
.  . abroad"; . .
“Tthe] nature and extent’ of executive branch oversight of all
United States intelligence activities"; . . ca
"the need. for improved, strengthened, or consolidated oversight
of United States intelligence activities hy the Congress”; and
the need for new legislation. |

I. IVTRODUCTION AND SU?MARY i :
, : |
This interim report covers allegations of United States involve-

ment in assassination plots against foreign political leaders. Of equal
i, .

: ! . a
significance in this report are certain other cases where foreign political
- '

leaders in fact were killed, where the United States was in some manner
. 1
' .

|
involved in activity leading up to the killing, but where it would be

incorrect to’ say that the purpose of United States involvement had been
to encourage assassination. i
. im ;
The evidence establishes that the United States was implicated in

mf ~ :

several assassination nlots.. The Committee believes that the use of assassi-

nation as a tool of foreign policy is incompatible with American principles,
mo 4

international order, and morality. It}should be rejected.

Our inquiry also revealed serious problems with respect to United

 

- States involvement in coups directed against foreign governments. Some of
j a : —
these problems are addressed here on the basis of our investigation to date;

others we raise as questions to be answered after our investigation into
; -

: covert action has been completed: ;
. oo \
We stress the interini nature)of this report. In the course of

the Committee's continuing work, other! alleged assassination plots tray

e ‘cases covered herein may come to

mets

surface, and new evidence concerning al

   

light. However, it is the Comm “yew that the cases covered herein

i

have been developed in sufficient detail to clarify the issues which are

at the heart of the Committee's mandate to recommend lesislative and other

reforms relating to the vital matters discussed below.

 

* The Vice Chairman reserved ‘as to jthe- first sentence in the discussion

r October 8, 1975
PROLOGUE

The events discussed in this Interim Report must be viewed in
the context of United States policy and actions designed to counter
the threat of spreading Communism. | Following the end of World
War II, many nations in eastern Europe and elsewhere fell under
Communist influence or control. The defeat of the Axis powers was
accompanied by the rapid disintegration of the Western colonial
empires. The Second World War no gooner ended than a new struggle
‘began... The Communist threat, emanating, from what was then called

the "Sino-Soviet bloc,"

produced ajpolicy of containment intended.

to prevent further encroachment by | Communi sm into the "free world. "
. United States strategy ‘for conducting the Cold War called for

the establishment of interlocking treaty arrangements and military

bases throughout the world. Our, concern over the expansion of an

 

 

aggressive Communist monolith led the United States to fight. two

major wars in Asia. In addition, it was considered necessary to
+ ~

“wage a relentless cold war. against [Communist expansion wherever

it appeared in the “back alleys of the world." This called for a
full range of clandestine ‘activities in response to the operations

of Communist clandestine services.

: ; -! . :
The fear of expanding Communism was particularly acute when

Fidel Castro emerged as the leader!of Cuba in the late 1950's. .
eG OF, ,

i

‘His takeover was seen as the first)significant penetration by the

 

{
“Communists into the Western Hemisphere. U.S.: leaders, including

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 5 i
most Members of Congress, called for vigorous action to stem the
Communist infection in this hemisphere. These policies rested on:
widespread popular support and encouragement.

Throughout this period, the urs. felt impelled to respond to
threats which were, or seemed to be, skirmishes. in a global. Cold

War against Communism, Castro's Cuba raised the spectre of a Soviet
outpost at America's doorstep. Events in the Dominican Republic
appeared to offer more such opportunities for the Russians and their
allies. The Congo, freed from Belgian rule, occupied the strategic’
center of the African continent, and the prospect of Communist pene-

tration there was viewed as a threst to American interests in emerging

Africa. - Americans are well aware et the powerful reactions set off

in the United States in the 1960" soy the domino theory. in Indochina.

And, even the election in 1970 of ja Marxist president ‘in Chile was
we fi
seen by some as a threat similar to. that of Castro's takeover in Cuba.

7
The Committee regards the untfleconate events dealt with in this
t

_ Interim Report as an aberration, eiplainable at least in part, but

not justified, by the pressure of events at the time. The Committee

‘

believes that it is»still in the national interest of the United
States ‘to do what it can to help nations resist Communist domination,
but it is. clear that. this cannot’ Justify in the future the kind of
‘abuses covered in this report. - Indeed, the Committee has resolved

that steps must be taken to prevent them from happening again.
