Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Act of 1992 (the Act)
Synopsis: San Francisco is requested to send requested files to
Headquarters/JFK Task Force as soon as possible due to an
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) letter requiring the
FBI's response.

Details: Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act of 1992 (JFKARCA) any material considered
assassination records must be made available to the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original
form. The JFKARCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain
information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be
maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in
full.

Therefore, the files will not be returned to your Field
Office. Since the originals will be sent to the NARA, copies of
the files should be made for record purposes prior to their
shipment to Headquarters. All files should be received at
Headquarters no later than C.O.B. 05/02/97.

If you have any questions, you may call Brian J. Fields
(202)324-9535.

Please ship the following files to FBIHQ, JFK Task
Force, Attention Brian J. Fields, Room 6362.
