During most of the period reported on, Subject
was concerned with administrative problems assuciated with the phase=-
out of the Station, Despite the consequent operational lull, Subject
continued to maintain a satistactory degree of morale in agents assigned
him, worked up and implemented realistic training programs, and con-
tinued. to develop excellent targets studies against the possibility of
a policy change. In addition, important information collected locally
by Subject on illegal activities ‘of Cuban ‘refugees was of great interest
to other agencies offic in the area, Suvject was the only Station
-gouree of such informa oo which was acquired only because of Subject’s
ability :vo maintain rapport with agents, terminated during the period
because of the cutback in infiltration operations. . :

It could also.bo noted as Subject finishes his long tour at this
Station and prepares for his next assignment, that he is a thoroughly
professional intelligence officer: and is, in many ways, an outstandircg
one, Technically, he is an expert on infiltration tactics and, though
his Special Forces experience, an expert on anti-guerrilla warfare as
well, Just as important, is his ability to gain respect and vapport
-with foreign agents, He has an imaginative appryach to operations,
is resourceful in devising tactics, and determined in carrying out his
assignments, He is a definite asset to WOFIRM: :
