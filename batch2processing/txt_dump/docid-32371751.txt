3, Training. None.
4. Photographic Operations.

a. At the request of Gerald F, GESTETNER, ASKREN was involved

as one of the participants in the planning stage of a surreptitious entry into

the apartment of a priority Station target. ASKREN was to assist Walter C.
GULLIVAN, once access had been gained to the target installation. However,
through no fault of the KURIOT technicians, the entry could not be accomplished
and the operation was then cancelled,

   

b, On the morning of 3 May, ASKREN was requested by GESTETNER
to photograph a meeting that was scheduled between a Soviet intelligence
officer and LIOYSTER/1. ASKREN registered under an alias name at a hotel
in downtown Mexico City, From a second story bedroom window, overlooking
a park, the meeting was successfully photographed with the aid of a Balscope
and Exacta camera,

c. The FJSTEAL and PBRUMEN Embassie's were both photographed
on 4 May at the request of the Chief of Station. Prints were then forwarded
to the Warren Commission, This coverage supplied the Station with current
photographs of both Embassies, which is always of considerable value,

d. FRANCOTTE placed the Pulse Camera at the LIERODE basehouse
during the evening of 26 May. The new camera, received from KURIOT
Headquarters, was installed and is operating perfectly, The older model
camera has been pouched to Headquarters for reconditioning, as requested
in HMMW-12500,

e. The current lease on the LITABBY basehouse will expire on
26 June and is not going to be renewed by the Station, LIMOPE and his family
have been moved to the STPESO basehouse where they will be involved in a
continuous audio qmeration, For the immediate future, there is no photographic
coverage planned for the BEDOX Embassy. However, FRANCOTTE has
discussed with Phineas F, SLINKARD the possibility of opening a new basehouse
in that same immediate area. There is an apartment building nearby, which
is in a "direct line of sight" with the front gate of the target Embassy, and
the possibilities of obtaining an apartment in that building are being explored,
KURIOT Headquarters will be kept informed on all developments in this case
as they occur.

5. Station Support.

a. The Deputy Ghiet of Station presented FRANCOTTE with a colored
map which he requestedscopied for projection, Ektachrome-X was employed,
combined with the Mark-lV copying set-up, and the results were most
satisfactory.: The new Ektachrome-X proves far superiar to the regular type
Ektachrome for copying purposes.

b. One hundred twenty five fee t of Microfilm was exposed on 7 May
to fulfill a monthly request originated by the Chief of Station.

c, The Station KURIOT equipment has been completely inventoried
due to the concentrated effort of Gérald N, ASKREN, during his recent TDY,
ASKREN ha dplarge percentage of the equipment inventoried when FRANCOTTE
returned to work, and remaining items were completed by FRANCOTTE and
ASKREN prior the latter's departure, FRANCOTTE sincerely appreciates the
assistance rendered by ASKREN on this project, as ASKREN's familiarity in
logistical matters was quite beneficial to FRANCOTTE,

e, The new KURIOT laboratory is now fairly well organized and
ope@ating smoothly, The custom-made cabinets will be a welcome addition when

with hegative results, Non-d@structive methods were employed in each case. -

7. Flaps and Seals Operations,

a. Lee Rk MYLECHRAINE informed FRANCOTTE that he would

require his assistance for a flaps and seals operation planned for the night of

19 May. That evening, twelve letters were passed to MYLECHRAINE from
SWLUCK/1 who was acting as a FJSTEAL courier between Mexico City and
Guatemala, Ten of the twelve letters were selected as being of importance,

and one of the ten was of definite interest to the Station, This particular

envelope had been folded by the originator and sealed with scotch tape.
FRANCOTTE was successful in opening and resealing all ten of the letters

in the time allowed. MYLECHRAINE did not receive the package until 2330

hours and the letters were required to be returned to SWLUCK/1 no later than 0100,

resealed for Glenna H, BELLEN,
