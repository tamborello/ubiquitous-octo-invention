Historian's Note

This paper covers activities of the CIA sta-
tion in Mexico City and bases in Monterrey, Nogales,
and Merida from 1947 to 30 June 1969, While re-
search on this paper was being done from late 1969
to mid-1970, some projects of long duration were
terminated for security or economic reasons. In
those instances, the descriptions of these activi-
ties extend beyond 30 June 1969.

Because the paper is not indexed, the table
of contents contains a detailed synopsis of each
chapter. The reader will note some repetition of
operational events in the text. There is a reason
for this. Chapters I and II were an effort on the
part of the writer to reduce to a reading minimum
a chronological summary of the origins of CIA oper-
ations in Mexico from 1947 to 1969 for persons who
do not have the time or the need to read several
hundred pages of station history. Subsequent chapters
treat the projects in more detail.

For the convenience of the reader, the writer

has grouped together those projects which pertain to

3. I assured Mr. Blakey that I would be happy to discuss

_ with him any of the deleted items and explain the nature of

the content and the reason for its deletion. I told Mr. Blakey
that since he was personally reviewing the material, and the
same would hold true for Mr. Cornwell, I felt that I could be
very candid in describing the deleted portions. Mr. Blakey
thanked me, but did not at any time raise any questions about
deletions. After he had finished his reiyew I repeated my
offer to discuss any portion of the material. He again thanked
me and said he had no questions.

4. Mr. Blakey did not indicate (nor did I ask) whether
he would continue to seek access to the entire three volume

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT : HSCA Access to Mexico City History

1. HSCA requested access to some 200 pages of the
three-volume history of Mexico City - about a third of
the material. The substantive content runs the gamut from
the history of Mexico University through detailed operation-
al support capabilities and-high level political connecte- ~
ions and activities. It is an impressive accumulation of
operational activity - classical sources and methods, as
well as detailed revelations about past events. :

2. We pointed out that the agreement between Chairman
Stokes and DDCI Carlucci directly faced the issue of the
irrelevancy of the vast majority of the history, and the
sensitivity of it. The HSCA position had been that it had
to verify this, and the access given to senior levels was.
to satisfy this. Now it was being requested in connection
with depositions, which would serve to get this material
into a Committee transcript. Since some two-thirds of the
station's history (the work covers 1947 through 1969) pre-
ceded the visit of Oswald to Mexico in 1963 and assassination
of the President, that clearly had nothing to do with the
Committee's charter. I added that Mr. Carlucci-is out of
town, and will not be back until some time Sunday, so I
could not go back to him. The request was so far beyond the
agreement, that I felt I could not modify it. Cornwell then
asked that I speak to the Director.

3. I saw the Director at about noon, and summarized |
the agreement and the dilemma, also going over the above.
He stated that I could offer access to one senior staff
member (in addition to Blakey and Cornwell)on the condition
that material from the history not be used in depositions.

4. I spoke with Cornwell, giving him the message. He
said that they may wish to use some of the material. I
replied that the history is based on other sources; those
related to the portion that is within the Committee's charter

was based entirely on sources to which Committee investi-

_gator's have had access. Our problem was the overall

collection, and particularly some of the substance of the
history. He asked if he could come back and ask for it,
if they wanted to use something in particular. I said
that we had never closed a door completely, but that the
Director's condition was fairly clear. Those things
relevant to their authorized inquiry were already in
their hands, so I could not think what they would have

to use from this. They will ask us, and we can react
when they do. .

5. Goldsmith came over to start reading.
