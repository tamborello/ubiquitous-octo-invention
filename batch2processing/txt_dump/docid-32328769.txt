On April 5, 1961, T-7 advised SA'S VINCENT H. LAMMERS
and CLARK S. MILLER that he is not aware of the source of
information concerning the receipt of race results coming into
Little Rock. SLOAN BENNETT, who gave T-7 $175.00 for use of
a room at T-7's residence during the 1961 Hot Springs, Arkansas,
(Oaklawn Race Track) racing season, advised T-7's wife that they
had a man at the track in Hot Springs who obtains the odds just
before post time, then leaves the track and calls Little Rock.
BENNETT did not advise T-7's wife the identity of the man at
the track or who he contacted in Little Rock with the informatbn.
It has been T-{!'s experience that odds in Little Rock are obtained
up to as late as two or three minutes before post time. Results
of the race are obtained in Little Rock within seven to ten
minutes after the race is completed. BENNETT stated on this
occasion to T-7's wife that the man at the track was reportedly
paid $15.00 a day for his work during previous years.

T-% advised he does not know for sure who is receiving
payoffs in connection with book operations in Little Rock. on
one occasion T-7's wife received a call during the Hot Springs
meet from an individual who identified himself as HAYNIE, who
T-7 assumed was Captain ALBERT M. HAYNIE, Chief of Detectives,
Little Rock Police Department. On this occasion the person
identifying himself only as HAYNIE instructed the wife of T-7
to have BENNETT (SLOAN) meet him at Granoff's Restaurant,
10th and Main Streets, Little Rock. Later T-7 overheard
BENNETT state he had to "Take care of that man at Granoff's,"

[-7 advised that as far as can be determined DUNAWAY
(HAROLD F,) seems to be the moving force among the "bookies"
in Little Rock. The printed scratch sheets are delivered early
in the morning to BENNETT'S establishment near 9th and Main
Streets, Little Rock, by DUNAWAY or his vepresentay yy) : /
