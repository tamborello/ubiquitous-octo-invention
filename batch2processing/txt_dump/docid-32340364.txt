this Conceivably could involve a CIA operative. ASAC
STANLEY SCHACHTER, «. 'Enforcement< Section, U. s. Customs,
Miami, advised that Customs was conducting investigation
into_this-matter. ~Hée was furnished VILLAR's name and
address and has been kept apprised of information fur-
nished to the Miami source by VILLAR. Additionally,
SCHACHTER fis aware of POSADA's CIA connections an tndi-O
cated he ld attempt to determine from CIA the éxtent $
CIA involvement, if any, in this activity.

All information available to Miami has been fur-
nished to U. S. Customs locally. Since the allegations
principally concern matters within primary jurisdiction of
U.S. Customs, Miami is conducting no additional investiga-
tion, UACB.

It is noted Jacksonville previously requested
Bureau authority to interview STANLEY HARRIS under the

enclosed LHM, it will not be necessary for Jacksonville to
report this information under the HART caption,
