1. . BACKGROUND.

The LIEMPTY Project is designed to collect operational: information on the
LIMERICK installation and personnel, as well as targets of opportunity, through
stationary and mobile photographic coverage. In addition, the project provides the
means for investigating leads from the above noted coverages as. well as other Stati
sources. LIEMPTY supports other Station operations through the renting of safehous?
providing. and servicing post office pox letter drops, conducting countersurveillancé
and investigations and performing related tasks.

2. OPSRATIONS.

“anne LIEMPTY Project continues to provide the majority of photographs used by t
Station in its CE operations against the LIMERICK target. No chanze is foreseen in
this phase of the operation. The product supplied by the project is considered an
essential tool “in following the daily activities of the personnel of the target
installation and visitors to that installation. Statistically LIEMPTY take for the
reporting period consisted of approximately 290 rolls of operational still photo
This total includes poth mobile and fixed photo surveillance take. The daily logs:
kept by the basehouses on the movements of the LIMERICK staff members aria visitors
greatly aid the Station CE efforts against that target, especially in times of cric

 

| In the area of specific support to Station operations (in addition to the
coverage provided against the LIMERICK target) the following is a list of selected
| LISMPTY contributions.

a. The LIEMPIY contribution to the sensitive AMROD operation, in tne form of
support provided by the cutouts Raymond H. GHRENDE (ps) and Oliver G.
SCANTLING (ps), can be described as unique and essential to the success ©
that operation. Although this operation is necessarily a Headquarters
directed effort, the operational work of GERENDE and SCANTLING is the
easentind ingredient in making the operation viable.

DISPATCH

 

  

 

Raymond H. GERENDE (ps) continued in his assignment as cutout to the
LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses and the LIENTRAP truck. GERENDE also
‘conducted an extensive investigation in Station's attempt to provide
positive identification of a group of PBPRIME students who visited the
LIMERICK installation. GERENDE and LIEMPIY-10 continue to provide and
“service P. 0. box drops for use in Station operations. During the recent
visit of AMSTRUT-2 to Mexico one of the drops was, for a time, sole active
conmunications link with AMSTRUT-2. GHRUWNDE provided twice daily servicing
of the drop during this period.

|

 

Oliver G. SCANTLING. (ps) continued as cutout to the LIMITED basehouse dur ing
the reporting period. In addition, he made his regular contribution as
alternate contact of. LICASA-1 in a sensitive operation of LAURICLE interest.
Based on LIEMPTY and LIENVOY leads, SCANTLING conducted an investipation

to determine the possibility of using the manager of a construction company
which was engaged in repair work at the LIMERICK installation to provide
access to that installation. SCANTLING located this individual and mansiced.
to elicit much information from him. Although SCANELING was prepared to

. continue the contact with this manager with a view toward his recruitment,
Headquarters and Station, using SCANTLING's information as a guide,
determined that the access provided in this instance was. not suitable for
mounting an operation. In another case, SCANTLING provided special servicin.
of a P, 0, box drop intended for backup communications with AEIMPULSE. | This
was discontinued 1 June when other arrangements were established for this
operation. :

 

 

 

Daring the reporting period operational employment of LIENTRAP continued at
a high level of activity. LIENTRAP provided 71 rolls of operational film
from coverage of selected targets. Most of this take related to the
Station's efforts against the PCM and Communist exiles residing in Mexico.

Since June the Station has been host to a TDY task force for the division
concerned with LIMERICK activity. This group has for its primary purpose
the collation of all available information from Station files on LIMERICK |
personalities. It is believed worthy of mention that probably the bulk of |
the information made available to the. task force is of LIEMPTY orisin. 7

 

 

In reference to paragraph 2 of reference b concerning information of
LAURICLE interest vrovided by LICALLA, Station was referring to the LICALLA !
‘photojtrephs and schetches of IDENTITY A installations at LIMERICK. As with}
the LIMESA agents, LICALLA has been given the requirement to provide periodic
reporting to the Station of this type material. ;

 

will be on file in the individual agent files at the Station, 1

There were no adverse security incidents effecting the project during the i
'

reporting veriod.

s equipment repaired and it was beck in operation on 29 July 1964.

Following plans previously set forth in reference A, LIEMPTY-5 (201- 12118 &0) and
LIEMPTY-12 (201-076363) were terminated as of 1 July 196k, Agent Service Record for -
LIFMPTY-8 was forwarded by HMMA-23890 and for LIEMPTY-12 by HMMA-23891. No decrease !
in the efficiency or security of the operation should result from these terminations. .

LIEMPTY-19 will revert to an hourly pay rate of $US2.25 as of 1 September 196)
in plece of the $US120.00 she had previously received. This, in addition to the
terminations noted above, should provide economies for the LIEMPTY Project in keeping,
with Station's efforts to cut back costs of support projects.

DISPATCH

 
 
  

Oliver G. SCANTLING (ps) has informed the Station that he has been chosen for
(IDENTITY B) postition by the Mexican Olympic Committee. He will take part in the
Olympics in Tokyo during October 1964, Other Station assets will assume the
operational assignments of SCANTLING during his absence from Mexico.

6. PRATINING.

“No “agent training other than regular review of tradecraft principles is planned.
Photographic product is reviewed daily as a standard procedure, and action agents arc
instructed as necéssary to improve or correct their technique in both taking and

processing the prouuct.
‘ 7. PLANS.

It is plenned to have Raymond.H.. GERENDE (ps) replace Oliver G. SCANTLING (ps)
as cutout to LIMITED basehouse. This will enable GERENDE to uidertake more
responsibility and give the Station opportunity to employ SCANTLING more fully in
pretext investigations, a field for which he. is particularly suited.
