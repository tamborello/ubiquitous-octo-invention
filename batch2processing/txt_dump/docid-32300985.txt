could be obtained from another source and suggested that NAIMAN ‘
allow DOMINICK BARTONE, a close friend of TRISCARO, to come into the
business, as BARTONE had access to considerable money and had many
contacts, In discussions that followed, BARTONE agreed to put

' $200,000 into the business as a first step and stated he would

obtain additional funds amounting to approximately one half
million dollars, which he would also invest in the business, In
consideration for the furnishing of this capital, NAIMAN assigned
50% of his stock in the Alvin Naiman Corporation and 50% of his
stock in the Niagara Crushed Stone, Ltd. to Servicios Internacionale
S.A., a Panamanian company under which BARTONE was operating. —
BARTONE put up the $200,000 and was instrumental in obtaining two
loans from the Public Bank of Detroit, each in the amount of
$240,000, one in the name of the Niagara Crushed Stone, Ltd., the
other in the name of the Alvin Naiman Corp. Both NAIMAN and
BARTONE co-signed ‘the notes, which were payable to the Public.
Bank and.called for payment of 6% or 7% interest and were for a
three-year period. NAIMAN believes this money was deposited at
Niagara's account at the Toronto-Dominion Bank at Welland,
Ontario, Canada,but has no personal knowledge of this, as he was
told by BARTONE to “keep his nose out of the business" and that
BARTONE would handle sales and keeping of records, NAIMAN
maintains that he was "kept in the dark" regarding the financial
aspects of Niagara and would not know if a "kickback", "finder's
fee" or similar payment was made to TRISCARO or others in connection
with obtaining the loan from the Public Bank. At the time that’
BARTONE became associated with NAIMAN's enterprises and during
subsequent contacts, TRISCARO was frequently in BARTONE's company
and appeared to be closely associated with him. - NAIMAN has stated
that Niagara is now in receivership in Ontario,

Cv-428-C recently advised that he had learned from a
discussion with the girl, name unrecalled, who kept the books for
Niagara, tht there was some "monkey business"with reference
to Niagara, as books showed a loan of approximately $750,000
from the Public Bank, Detroit, whereas Niagara, according to its
bank acgount at the Toronto-Dominion bank, received only $250,000,

Bearing on this same matter is a statement made by
BURT C, HADDAD, accountant and associate of ALVIN NAIMAN, who
advised that DOMINICK BARTONE has been negotiating with the
Meisner Engineering Company of Chicago, Illinois, for the sale
of Niagara to Meisner. According to HADDAD, officials of Meisner
Engineering Company, who have been checking into the financial

situation of Niagara, have stated there is a discrepancy of
between $250,000 and $300,000 in what the Public Bank of Detroit
claims is due them on loans made to Niagara and what the books
of Niagara show as actually being owed. The Meisner Company,
according to HADDAD, requested that HADDAD consider auditing the
books. HADDAD said he submitted an estimate for the audit but
to date has heard nothing further. He said he has heard, source
unrecalled, that. JOE VERHELLE, President of the Public Bank of
Detroit, which is known as a "Teamster bank" in that it is one
of the principal-depositories of Teamster funds in the central
states area, is of questionable integrity and closely associated
with high-ranking Teamsters. HADDAD expressed the view that the
possibility, exists some of the funds obtained from the Public
Bank in the form of loans may have been diverted to Teamster
officials. He pointed out he has no evidence that such a diversion

_of funds actually occurred, HADDAD said if Meisner‘contracts him

to audit the books of Niagara, he will make these books available

to the Cleveland Office, FBI, for examination. Mr. HADDAD has
been contacted on numerous occasions during recent weeks, at

which times he has stated he has heard nothing further from Meisner
Engineering Company or DOMINICK BARTONE and does not know if any
Gecision has yet been made regarding the audit of the books of

Niagara or the present location of these books.
