LA 92-1112

5 So ; ; ; ; ;
As a result of information furnished by LA 4412-C-TE,
investigation went forward toward the further penetration of

this organization and certain interviews were conducted on ‘
4/29/63 and 5/2/63; which, in turn, led to the eventual :
development of LA 4448-pc, who is currently an active member :
of what he terms locally "the situation" or "the outfit," which

he advises is the outgrowth of. .the old Mafiosa.

 

The interviews to date, which are two in number,
have not fully explored all the ramifications of the "outfit"
in this area due to the natural reluctance of the source to
fully explain to law enforcement the existence of a secret
society such as the "outfit." It is expected that full details
will eventually be gained during the ensuing months, which will
be furnished to the Bureau and New York as they occur.

This report is being kept brief in order that it
will reflect only what is considered documented membership and
leadership in the organization in this area.
