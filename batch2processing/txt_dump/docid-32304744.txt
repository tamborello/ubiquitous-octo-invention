; . We have received a request. from the Department for a list of
all individuals named by former NY 3864-C-TE as members of La Cosa
Nostra. This source was Alfredo Sanantonio,. member of the Carlo
Gambino "family™ in this organization, who was the victim of a gang
slaying in Brooklyn, New York, on July 11, 1963. Sanantonio had
furnished us extremely valuable information on La Cosa Nostra,
including the identities of a large number of its leaders and other |
members, In making this request, the Department did not specify what
use they intend to make of such a list.

. New York is now completing a summary report covering _,, -
recent developments in the investigation of this organization across the’? o i
country, which should contain some of the data requested by the” = =
Department. It was necessary that a few amendments be made in this-
report and when New York has completed these changes, the report. will

- receive further careful review at the Bureau. “
