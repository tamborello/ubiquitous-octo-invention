joining, however, DUBISSON expressed an interest in joining.

‘GARNER stated that the recent plan to have a second newspaper

“published in Bogalusa, La., as competition for the "Bogalusa

Daily News" had fallen through. WARNER stated that his
Minutemen Unit would held their next meeting on 1/19/65, but

“that hid son GUSSIE WARNER and O"NEAL JONES, who are members

would hot be able to attend inasmuch as these two individuals
have had to attend a meeting and reseive instructions which
are given to the Auxiliary Police of the Bogalusa PD, of
wich they are members.

WARNER stated that after the meeting on 1/19/65,

‘members of his Unit would go to the Office of Attorney BASCQI
_ PALLEY on Columbia St. He said that they would attach a

fine piece of wire to the back door handle and run this wire
to a frame box approximately ISfect away which would either
contain gravel or a dead animal and that this box would be
covered with tar paper. WARNER stated that this would be
done to harass BASCOH VALLEY because when he comes to his
office on the following day, he would enter the back door

as is his normal custom and: on approaching this door would
gee the wire running from the handle to.a frame box and would

think that the wixe was attached to some explosive device. ,
