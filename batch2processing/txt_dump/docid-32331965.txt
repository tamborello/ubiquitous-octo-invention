that PAT CARUSO or PAT FERRUCCIO, not further described. of

The following investigation was conducted to
identify JEROME M, GLUCK, who was characterized during
the initial stages of this investigation as an agent for
the Dominican Republic attempting to purchase arms and
ammunition in Pittsburgh, Pa. Thisrhase of theinvestigation

from JOE MEROLA's suite at the Warwick-Hotel in-New York,
N.¥., on 9/6/58, to the office of JAMES A, ASHTON, attorney
at law, Pittsburgh:

' phot ographs in the space of approximately 20 seconds. At
present, these photographs are being developed but it is
doubtful whether they will be of ‘any value to this investigation.

PG 52- 1687

No additional photographic surveillances are :
contemplated from the POST home or elsewhere in-New Kensington
because of the obstacles outlined above. The situation will be
followed closely, however, and inthe event MANNARINO should
ever appear in public without sunglasses photographic
surveillances will again’ be considered.

' ALBERTO ARDURA, aka., Alberto Ardura “Moya

Investigation: conducted to date in-Miami’ and Jacksonville,
' Florida, discloses that ARDURA, a Cuban National and part-owner
of the Tropicana Nightclub, now living in Ormond Beach, Florida,
with his family since the collapse of the BATISTA government,
has been identified in connection with an exchange of long
_ distance. telephone calls to NORMAN ROTHMAN, now under indictment
'. in this case,which included calls to "SAMMY" in-New York City
. during February, 1959, who is probably. identical with
.Mational top hoodlum SAMUEL MANNARINO.

For the benefit of all offices, ARDURA has long been
‘recognized by the Pittsburgh Office as a confederate of SAMUEL
’~MANNARINO. As an example, MANNARINO in October, 1956, advised
_ that he had shipped a number of slot machines to ARDURA. and
ROTHMAN in care of the Tropicana Nightclub in Havana, Cuba,
and pointed out that.Cuban Government, at that time, had
granted them permission to place the machines in various spots

throughout the island.~-MANNARINO at that time admitted, that
he would have an: interest inthe operation: ~--

 

Moreover, Havana 4, interviewed by the Legat in
September, 1956, described ARDURA as the principal importer
of slot machines in Cuba associated with MARTIN FOX in the
operation of the Tropicana Nightclub. -Havana 4 at that time
characterized ARDURA as a close personal friend of Colonel
ROBERTO FERNANDEZ MIRANDA, brother-in-law of former Cuban
dictator FULGENCIO BATISTA and director ofthe Cuban aC

Commission ef Sports. Havana 4 said at that time that :
through the influence of MIRANDA, ARDURA had no difficulty
‘in placing slots on-location im: Cuba, K(W ; . -

.__._ To further demonstrate ARDURA's closeness to co
MANNARINO,; it is interesting to note that during the ‘Top
Hoodlum investigation in New Kensington, it was discovered
that during the-period, March, - 1957, to July, 1957, the
New Ken Novelty Company, operated by MANNARINO, shipped 137
slot machines and five boxes of slot machine parts to ‘
ALBERT ARDURA, in care of the Tropicana Nightclub.

; : On the basis of past experience in. the Top Hoodlum
Program, there is little doubt that MANNARINO, ROFHMAN and
ARDURA ‘are -very clése and it is~not~ beyond the realm of :
possibility that ARDURA, along with ROTHMAN, could have been
the receiver of the National Guard weaponsswhen they reached

- Guba, - ; : : : .

. It is significant that Dr. LOUIS C. PESSOLANO, ;
when first interviewed concerning the part he played in the

' gun-running conspiracy, came up with the name CECIL HARDURA,
as the person who instructed him-to rent the twin-engine -
Beechcraft for a hunting and fishing party. Dr. PESSOLANO
has, of course; implicated ROFHMAN-as~the man-who instructed
him in the matter since that time but in his effort to-hamper
the investigation, PESSOLANO- may have unintentionally brought
Out the fictitious -name HARDURA knowing that ARDURA was
involved in the conspiracy.

PHILLIP JAMES MAINER, FBI #868314A

   

_- It is-recalled that MAINER and his associate, GEORGE
MIKE FLOREA, FBI #2888609; were named by Canton, Ohio, Police
Department informant at the- beginning of this investigation
as the men who committed the burglary at the Ohio National
Guard: Armory on 10/14/58... ~ ‘

It is also recalled that supplemental: investigation

the 3 & S Distributing Company panel truck was used: to
transport part of the stolen weapons to the airport in this

SAMUEL MANNASRING.-

When interviewed im February, 1959, POI ABRAHAM |
claimed he was not aéquainted wich MAINER but mentioned
two individuals had approached him some time ago with a
load of hot cigarettes. It may be significant that ABRAHAM
-brought out the name of a man who tried to Sell the hot
cigarettes who is now deac. oO

The following iWestigation was conducted’ to
again determine whether ABRABAM could be acquainted with
MAINER .

On 4/21/59 PCL ABRAHAM: examined a good photograph -
of MAINER and advised SA JOHN S$. PORTELEA that-MAINER was not
the person who accompanied UPFIE- CHARLES, deceased, several
years ago in an effort to sell a load of stelen cigarettes.
ABRAHAM also denied that he ever referred CHARLES or anyone
else attempting to sell stolen merchandise to GABRIEL
MANNARINO at the S-&-S Distributing. Company or anyone
connected with the ‘MANNARINO gang. ;

It is noted that earlier in this investigation
confidential source MIKE ZERVOS, who is well acquainted with
ABRAHAM, positively identified MAINER as the person who

approached ABRAHAMuLth another unknown individual approximately

two years age in an effort to sell @ load of cigarettes.
ZERVOS also pointed cut at-that time that he had seen MAINER
‘in New Kensington on @ number of occasions loafing around the
