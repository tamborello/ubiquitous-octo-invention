SUBJECT: FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE (FPCC )
‘\.. RA = CUBA
~- CUBA
Is«¢
- SWP

 

Attached hereto for’ the Bureau are 13 copies of
a memorandum dated and captioned as. above,

NY T-1 is NY 3229-8,

A likely possibility exists that the FPCC may
receive Cuban funds in order to publish the contemplated
advertisement concerning OAS action. against Cuba. These 3
funds could be channelized into. the FECC through ROBERT
1. TABER, RICHARD GIBSON or WILLIAM WORTHY,

Supporting this contention is the fact that the
FPCC has only $87.00 in its treasury at present.
