JOSE PARDO LiLADA is currently residing in

the Hotel Emperatriz in Madrid. He claims to be an

enemy of Communism but #t the same time he backs almost

all the measures adopted by the CASTRO government. He
ae : tries to justify the system and made various allusions

to the lack of capacity of persons in responsible

positions in Cuba and placed the blame on them for

the present chaotic situation in Cuba. He does not

describe CASTRO nor the members of his government

as Comm although ‘he recognizes that all of them

are ‘domingted and under the control of members ‘of the

Communist Party. He claimed that REGINO BOTI, Minister

of Economy, RAUL CEPERO BONILLA, Director of the National

Bank and ex-Minister of Commerce, and LUIS Cae

as JORGE ANTONIO went to the airport to meet the subject,
