7 i i was advised by the Justice Department on 23 February that
. Werbel has beeri indictéd and the trial is scheduled to begin on. 29 March
. in Miami, Florida’ “The charges relate to importing and distributing
quantitiés of marijuana. With Werbel's propensity to raise his past :
’ .. affiliations with the Agency, we can anticipate problems during this trial, .
An additional problem is presented because Werbel is defended by Edwin
- 4 Margér who was the ense attorney for John Hawk in the B-26 case in
‘Buffalo, New ¥erk in 1966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed the CIA |
; General Counsel as a’defense witness. : 7

i 2. The Justice Department has received information that a person

either currently or formerly affiliated with the CIA has been participating
in Werbel's meetings with his attorney. It would be appreciated if all

. addressees could review their holdings on Werbel and determine if there

j is any validity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruc-
‘tions be sent to Miami that no, repeat no, contact with Werbel take place.
between now and the beginning of the trial. .

 

3. It would be helpful if each addressee could prepare a summary
of the various contacts Werbel has had with CIA in the past. Please check
to see if you have any information on a Colonel Bayard who was ki'led in

' Auanta, Georgia during the summer of 1975, Bayard, reportedly an
" associate of Werbel's. had previous contacts with the Agency. It would
be appreciated if your responses could be received by close of business

3, Regarding the relationship of Werbelil ta the Agency, as’

questions of the Court concerning Werbell. A copy of thé transcript

. of that-proceeding is attached. You will note that Judge Fay requested
“that all pertinent gov ernment records be made available to the Court
‘for its inspéction. Accordingly, copies of Agency files were reproduced,
culled for "Brady-type” décuments, ex¢ised to protect sources and
methods under the "SWP case criteria" and reviewed and approved by
Assistant DD/O-on the evening of 1 September. These processed:
documents Were then handcarried to Miami by the undersigned on

4. The undersigned advised Judge Fay ‘at 9330 hours on
had in my possession copies of all of the “Agency .
‘files on WerbeD) had culled them as to possible "Brady" documents
nd was prepared. to ¥eview them with the Judge at his convenience.
“He was on the bench with a tight schedule and zsked that the possible
Brady documents first be reviewed by Karen Atkinson, the principal
counsel for the prosecution. The undersigned subsequently briefed
Atkinson on the nature of data in the possible Brady documents. This
resulted in a significant reduction in the number of possibles. The
undersigned gave Atkinson copies of the four unclassified OGC
documents related to the DOD revocation of Werbell's security clearance
in 1971. In addition, Office of Security documents edited and approved
for release to Werbell under his Freedom of Information and Privacy :
Act.request:.(Tabs A-and B of OS response), consisting of media : '
publications and security investigative data, were 2lso provided : i
Atkinson. Due to counsel for Werbell raising an issue on Werbell's

  
  

  

“use of a boat named "Venus" belonging to CIA, 2 declassified copy i

 

of the OS short investigative report outlining data concerning Werbell's | i
use of the Venus to transport arms was also provided Atkinson. The :
related OS Headquarters assignment document was not provided.
Related DDO documents on the ownership-of Venus by the "JURE"
Cuban group were mentioned to Atkinson but rot made available.

5. While the above decuments were provided the, Department of :
Justice with the undérstanding they could be passed to Counsel for
erbell dué to subsequent events noted below, it is not certain that
this occurred. Specifically, the undersigned declined to release
additional "Brady" documents without consultation end instructions

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

Walter T. Lloyd .
Associate General Counsel

: Mitchell Livingston Werbell, I

  

 

 

- J+ 7 dh Assyou are-aware, on the instruction of United States
- District Judge Peter Fay (Miami, Florida Division). ‘incident to
_ ‘the: Drug Enforcement Administration's prosecution of Subject

_for conspiracy to import and distribute multi-ton loads of
marijuana, the undersigned made a detailed review of the files
of this Agency concerning Subject.in August 1976. This exami-

. nation’ was to ascertain any data that ran to Werbell's guilt or
innocence of the offense charged and any other data reflecting the
nature of the relationship between Werbell and the U.S. Government. -
This latter requirement was grounded on the Court's view that
Werbell's voluntary reporting to the Agency and any government
condonation of his activities might be exculpatory in the eyes of the

jury.

2. In response, we reviewed the files, identified Agency

‘contacts with Subject and prepared two affidavits: one regarding
non-employment by Mr. B. DeFelice and the second regarding
Werbell's relationship to the Agency by the undersigned. Copies

are attached. During the trial the first affidavit was shown to

_counsel for Werbell by DEA counsel, Mr. Sam Sheres, at which .
point defendant's counsel stipulated that Werbell was never a

x formal employee of the Central Intelligence Agency- Sheres

subsequently returned the affidavits ‘to the undersigned at the
conclusion of the trial.
