; In the late afternoon 3/2/62, BRUNO talked to JOE
WILSON, who has been identified by PH 614-C (TE) as a book-
keeper or an attorney used by BRUNO. It appears that WILSON
is explaining to BRUNQ a shakeup of personnel from the
Internal Revenue (IRS) office in Camden, N.J. WILSON
possibly had been talking to DYKE (phonetic) in regard to
this switch of personnel. BRUNO was told, "The fellow

you were asking me about one day is over in Camden right
‘now, BILL CULLEN." WILSON said that he had "the Director's
job in Camden, he! s the boss in Camden." WILSON said,

a it could be worse, let's put it that way." WILSON said,

1 "a lot of people know him, we have done a few.favors for him,
‘I'm glad he is there." BRUNO said, “Well, T'al tell you,
he. used. to be all right. I don't know how he is now."

 

: : WILSON. indicated that CULLEN in the last few years
‘had become conscientious and was doing everything by the book,
that he had hurt a few. people that WILSON did not think should
have been. hurt.. WILSON suggested he did not know whether these
people. that had been hurt had been hurt intentionally or because
CULLEN did not have control. WILSON then explained CULLEN was
the Director of the Camden Office; the Newark Office had had

an Assistant Director, KENNETH BROOK or BOOK (phonetic) who

was previously assistant: for JOE MAHER, who is now in Phila-
delphia. BROOK took MC GINNIS' job when MC GINNIS retired.
CULLEN went to Camden te replace GROSS. GROSSSwent to Newark

to replace KENNETH BROOK or BOOK, the Acting Director, and
BROOK or BOOK came to Philadelphia as Director. WILSON said
the worse guy in the above ,bhree was GROSS who was described

as “positively impossible." .

BRUNO wanted to know about BROOK and WILSON said
from previous association BROOK had been fair. WILSON said,
"We had a nice relationship with him and our other way is
to talk to BILL GREEN to find out what part GREEN played
to get him the job.'

It appears that WILSON may be suggesting that
Congressman WILLIAM GREEN, Philadelphia, would have to be
contacted to ascertain what part the Congressman played in
obtaining BROOK or BOOK his assignment as Director (IRS),
Philadelphia.

BRUNO is next in conversation with PH 540-c. This
informant had contacted BRUNO at the request of friends whe
were in the cigarette vending business and wanted to ask BRUNO
not te'take their customers away. BRUNO was not receptive to
this request. He told this informant that the same people had
sent WILLIE WEISBERG down to ask him' to leave their customers
alone. Informant explained to BRUNO that he was attempting to
start a business venture which would be to sell insurance
policies in coin-operated machines that would eover land travel.
The insurance policies are similar to those dispensed at air-
ports except they cover land travel. Informant mentioned that
the machines could go anywhere such as hotels, motels, bus Lo
terminals, etc., and that he would like to put one of the machines
in a trucking company. BRUNO tells the informant to go over to
Moon Carrier in Camden, N. J., to. see Mr. HENNY; who has the
authority to put the machine in there, and)-to tell HENNY that
BRUNO had instructed the informant to comé over. BRUNO said
that he could "intercede with Local 107 of the Teamsters" and
was sure he could put the machines any place where Local 107
had connections. BRUNO told the informant he had connections
with the Teamsters Union in New Jersey and, in fact, he could
send the informant over to New York and he could put the machines
in the Union business terminals.

On Sunday, 2/11/62, BRUNO held a conversation with
IGNATIUS DENARO, aka., and SAM (LNU) from Trenton, N. J., in re-
gard to arbitrating a dispute in regards to numbers operation
in the Trenton, N. J. - Bristol, Pa., area. This conversation,
partly in Italian or in the Sicilian dialect, is set out in its
entirety. It is pointed out that this information was furnished
to all offices whitch have an interest in "the Commission" by
airtel 2/23/62. Portions of this airtel, which include the .
entire conversation with the comments in the Italian translation,
are included herewith:

- BRUNO: “All I- want: to know is did. his wife get
; pinched. ;

 Unimown man said no. and that. he. would get 100 Percent
details and see ANGELO about it.

' BRUNO said.it would be-all wight and he: would ‘see
ENYOTS (phonetic) IGNATIUS ‘DENARO.

. On 2/15/62 ANGELO BRUNO again meets with PH 540-c
and with EDWARD: WALKER, official, Local. 107,. Teamsters Union,
Philadelphia. .This conversation is in regards to the informant
placing machines that dispense insurance. The company handling
the machines. was identified as Band ; Travel Life. Insurance.,

BRUNO said thathhe was. going away and when he returns.
he would get WALKER: and the informant bogether so that they
could get better.acquainted. BRUN@® is explaining to the informant
that the Teamster officials work together. It was not clear but

- it was indicated that the union officials in Local 25, not
further identified, want to "make a note out of it." "Make a
note out of it" is a Philadelphia expression for: accepting graft.
It is. believed WALKER is explaining to the informant that if the
insurance machines were placed in certain-loecals, individuals
would want a kickback. BRUNO said “you" (the informant) under-
stand, like in New York there is somebody. you will have:to take
care of. Over here you take care of EDDIE." -

: BRUNO again told the informant when che returned from
Miami he would take him to HENNY who managed the Moon Carriers.
in Camden, N. J., so that JOE could arrange to place a machine
at the Moon Carrier terminal for a test pattern. The informant
left and BRUNO had a conversation with WALKER. He: told. him that
HENNY. had been telling BRUNO what was going on, that WEAVER; a.
union official in Camden, had the cigar factory workers lined
up and could get a charter with the AFL- -CIO, and that there were
about 600 members involved. BRUNO said he did not think that
these 600 workers should be pulled away. and placed in the ABE-CIO
because "you are going to need those cigar workers for votes,"
BRUNO said he had been telling HENNY to lay off, to wait, and.
wanted to know if WALKER understood. WALKER mentioned the last
time that he was to see BRUNO and a JIMMIE was apparently involved.
