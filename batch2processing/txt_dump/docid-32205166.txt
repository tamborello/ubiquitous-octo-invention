I. In general, the Cubans appear to be following the
textbook for guerrillas in regard to provision of
arms. We have strong evidence, from numerous
sources, that they are telling the guerrilla war-
fare students and their leaders to obtain their
own weapons at home. We have enough reports and
some good evidence, however, that there are just
enough exceptions to prove the rule.

A. Our agent who was in the original group of
Brazilian trainees said he was trained ex-
clusively in the use and maintenance of the
Garand M-1l and M-3 rifles and the Browning and
Hotchkiss machineguns--all us weapons. His”
‘group was told that these were the weapons
Brazilian guerrillas would be able to buy,
‘steal, or take from the security forces at
home.

B. Similarly the Argentine trainee mentioned
earlier said their instructors told them Cuba
would not be sending weapons because there
was a plentiful source of supply for’ any de-
termined guerrilla movement in its own home-_

land.

SEGRE T——_

Leaders of militant groups in Venezuela, Brazil,
and Peru who have gone to Cuba seeking assistance
have been told by the Cuban leaders that Cuba is
willing to furnish funds, training, and technical
assistance. Reference to weapons is pointedly
omitted. This is reported to us by our agents

in these Same groups.

We have within the past month again checked with

all of our stations in Latin America to review

what evidence we have of arms shipments from

Cuba. There are several cases of radio trans-

mitters admittedly brought in from Cuba (although

in Venezuela so much radio equipment was stolen
last fall this was unnecéssary). I have already
mentioned the weapons bought in Mexico for Guate-
mala with money from Cuba. In Peru, the guerrilla
trainees who were rounded up in the Huampani-
Satipo incident last. March had. been issued kits —
containing a Czech rifle with a pistol grip, ap-
parently of bloc origin. :

Otherwise, however, in case after case guerrilla
hardware turned out to have been bought or stolen
lecally; or smuggled in from the adjoining coun~
try. We do not have a single case where we are

certain of the Cuban origin of captured arms.

Ii. This is not to say that we are positive weapons have

. not been sent from Cuba. Latin America has a long
tradition of smuggling, a long coastline, innuner-
able isolated landing fields and drop zones, and
inadequate security forces to control all such
channels.

A. Last July a source in Costa Rica informed us
that he had just helped unload a shipment of 30
rifles from Cuba. We sent a reliable agent
back with the source to locate the rifles, but
apparently they had already been removed and
‘hidden.

Be A Venezuelan Communist leader has been telling
guerrilla leaders that Cuba will soon send them
mortars. It is always possible, of course, that
he is fabricating to build up the morale of his
units, but we must also conclude that if he is
indeed making this up, he risks inevitable dis-
illusionment.

TII.. In summary, then, we have no hard proof that Cuba is
sending weapons to Latin American insurgents. We
have evidence that in principle Cuba does not intend
to do so at present. But we have no reason to be-
lieve that they will not or cannot if they feel it

necessary to do so.
