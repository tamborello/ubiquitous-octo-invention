exploded in his car at Miami, Florida.

MASFERRER was Imowm as "El figre" (The niger) when
he was a Senator in Cuba. Men who worked for him in Cuba

were his personal bodyguards and made up a small army which
MASFERRER utilized for his owm personal yvrotection and for

his political advancement. These men were known as "Masferrer's
Tigers" and were feared by the Cuban population as they \ were
responsible for many killings. ; feo

In March, 1976, MANUEL DE ARMAS, @ Cuban exile who

. was then living in Miami, Florida, and was utilized as an

informant by the FBI, defected to Cuba. While in Cuba, DE ARMAS
made numerous releases to the press at the recuest of the

Cuban Government. Much of the information furnished by

DE ARMAS was false. In one of the interviews which was
televised in Havana, DE ARMAS stated that the explosives used
to kill MASPERRER were furnished to him by SA ROBERT MILLS of
the Miami Division. DE ARMAS said that he in turn gave the
explosives to members of the anti-Castro organization Abdala.
DE ARMAS alleged that members of Abdal. led MASFERRER using

MM 174~926 ‘

On 1/24/77, MM 3945-C advised that ANDRES PASEIRO,
brother-in-law of MASFERRER, wanted to bring criminal charges
against SA MILLS based on DE ARMAS! statements. Ke)

PASEIRO, JOSE ELIAS THUMAS and LUCILA MONTERO MASFERRER ,
ROLANDO MASFERRER' s widow, were interviewed regarding the
allegation against SA MILLS in tate January and early February,
1977.

it is noted that. DE ARMAS returned to the United
States in September, 1976, and was interviewed by Special
Agents of the Utica, New York Resident Agency and the CIA.
In the interview DE ARMAS denied any\direct knowledge of ;
MASFERRER's murder, and admitted fabricating this story about’
SA MILLS having furnished him with explosives. It is noted
that DE ARMAS alleged that SA MILLS furnished C-4 for the —
MASFERRER killing, when in fact dynamite was used. DE ARMAS,
who appears to be a pathological liar, also told Homicide
detectives of the Dade County Public Safety Department in MIL
that the information he furnished about SA MILLS is false. an

Because of MASFERRER's involvement with the violent
element in the Miami area ond the possibility that his friends
and followers may have believed DE ARMAS' story and could
retaliate in some violent way against SA MILLS or his family,

. 4t was decided by the Miami Office that an interview of Mrs.

MASFERRER and her brother-in-law was proper to evaluate the
possibility of a threat to SA MILLS or his family. SAs
FREDERICO VILLALOBOS and ROY L. MOBLEY, JR. were instructed
to interview Mrs. MASFERRER, ANDRES PASETRO and JOSE ELIAS
THUMAS, aka Jose Elias Nacin. (Copy of FD=3028 regarding .
these interviews are enclosed).

It is noted that NACIN is a member of a violent’
terrorist organization named "Pragnmatistas" and was recently
convicted in Miami of conspiracy to commit murder. This —
involved the shooting death of LUCTANO NIEVES, @ well-known
Cuban exile in Miami.
