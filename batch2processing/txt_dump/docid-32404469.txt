Note to JFK Team CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS

From: Barry Harrelson ~ ; RELEASE IN FULL
2000

Subject: New JFK Review Process

David Marwell, ARRB Executive Director, is planning to dons
propose to the Board that they change the review process.
Toth: g

 
 
 
 

The focus would change from®tracking individual

postponements to tracking the release of d nder

the new approach his staff would have th

negotiate with the Agency on the release n and

to make decisions on the released versions of documents. y
Only issues/documents of disagreement would be placed before (Qua
the Board.

Marwell is convinced that even with an additional year a
they will not finish the project with the current approach.
He and I spent some time discussing how a new process for
would work. He would like to test this process for the April
meeting.

The following is a rough outline with some notes for
your review . Please provide me with comments by COB Monday.

1) HRG and DO reviewers would review the documents the
same as they do now (postponements would be blue
highlighted). [no change in our procedures]

2) ARRB staff would review the blue highlighted
document.

a) If they agree, they would stamp the document
“ARRB approved” and return it to HRG to process,
for NARA.

b) If they-disagree they would highlight over the
blue with yellow (creating green highlighting) ,or
mark in some way, the information they think
should be released. If the two staffs cannot
resolve the issue, then the document would go
before the Board.

[Major change: ARRB staff would no longer record all the
proposed postponements, no DO “damage review”, no detailed

determination letter requiring HRG reviewers to use the
“grid” to determine what happen.]

3) “Non-issue” documents would be prepared by HRG for
NARA and sent to the ARRB staff when ready. At that time
the ARRB staff would prepare a simplified final
determination notice and letter.

[ No further action on the document would be required; HRG
would file the final determination notice with the document
in the retention and “new ORIS” file].

4) “Green” highlighted documents that go to. the Board
would be handled the same as today.

{The expectation is that a lot less documents would require
Board action. ] .

A major impact will be an increase in the number of
documents reviewed. The new process creates a continuous
flow of documents to be reviewed and prepared for NARA. The
capability of the ARRB to handle documents would greatly
increasing requiring us to pick up the pace of the review.
