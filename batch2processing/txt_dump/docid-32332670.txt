TECHNICAL OR MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCE |

The most important information furnished by this informant :
since the submission of the last FD-143 on 3/22/62 4
concerns a meeting of JOHN CONTI, alleged nephew of . ,
- SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCGA, who.is general manager at
‘the North Star Cement Block Company in Pittsburgh, and. cela
“SAMUEL MANNARINO of the MANNARINO organization, of New  ~- oo a
Kensington, Pa., on whom an intensification target-type ..
investigation is being conducted, It was noted by the , oa
informant that these two met. last on a business proposition oN :
on Sunday, 6/3/62. |. an \
\ a
It was ‘indicated that MANNARINO owns 600 acres, of: ground
‘and is now. dealing with the North Star Cement Block Company “.
to build homes on his property. . y ;
of these homes was to begin imme
indicated that MANNARINO is > definitely part of the :
entire proposition. 5 i

 

As a result of this information, ‘the Bureau has advised
that this matter should be given thorough investigative
attention in connection with disruption objectives

and possible future prosecution,

On 6/11/62, the Pittsburgh Office ascertained that there

was considerable inductance and erdss-talk on cable 56,

counts 341 through 50 as well as considerable AC voltage

running as high as two volts on count 348, CSPG 175-S

was contacted concerning this undesirable condition and i
he immediately referred the matter to the Engineering : :
Department of the Bell Telephone Co. Due to the complexity

of these existing conditions monitoring of the misur

and tesur operations was discontinued on 6/11/62 until

the lines can be cleared and balanced, The Pittsburgh

Office has not, therefore, had the benefit of the knowledge

of the operations within .the North Star Cement Block
