This report is not being submitted in the
form of a supplemental prosecutive summary, since it
contains no positive evidence.of value.

ORLANDO REGO BORREGO, 53 _N.W. 68th Terrace,
Miami, was interviewed on August 18, 1965, at which
time he identified himself as being auditor of MIRR.
REGO advised that he had become suspicious of the
activities of BOSCH and some of the inner circle members
of the organization and believed that they had engaged
in some dishonest practices relating to funds of the
organization. He. possessed no evidence of any extortion
conspiracy but offered to attempt to obtain information
which would be useful to this office, on a confidential
basis. Thereafter he advised that Dr. JOSE LUIS
ECHEVEITE, New York City,;-might possess pertinent
information. The interview of ECHEVEITE at New York
City is included in this report.

‘REGO also advised that AIMEE MIRANDA, 218
S. W. 16th Avenue, is extremely close to BOSCH on
confidential matters, and he suspected that she might
have made a typewriter available -to BOSCH or possessed
information concerning extortion.

On October 8, 1965, REGO advised that he had
made further inquiry of some of his friends in the .
organization and had determined that’ AIMEE MIRANDA had
purchased a typewriter from the Singer Sewing Machine
Company. The resulting investigation is set forth in
this report.

On September 15, 1965, WILLIAM JOHNSON, "1130
N. E. 196th Terrace, a U. S. Customs informant and former
associate of BOSCH, advised confidentially that. BOSCH
had denied to JOHNSON that he was involved in any
extortion. BOSCH claimed that the FBI took his typewriter

at the medical clinic. JOHNSON said that BOSCH had never

borrowed a typewriter from him and he possessed no
knowledge of BOSCH having acquired a typewriter from
anyone else. He had no knowledge of BOSCH or anybody
else in the MIRR being implicated in extortion.

On September 15, 1965, MIKE RAFFERTY, 400
N. E. 155th Terrace, Miami, who has previously been
associated with BOSCH,.also advised confidentially
that he possessed no evidence that BOSCH or anyone.
else in the MIRR had been involved in extortion. He
also possessed no information relating to typewriters
pertinent to this case.

/ On September 24, 1965,
1736 S. W. 14th Street, Miami, Treasurer:of the MIRR,
advised confidentially that he has become dis-enchanted
with the leadership of BOSCH in the MIRR and suspects
that BOSCH may have been engaging in some illegal
or unethical activities and, therefore, he is planning
to get out of the organization. He said. that AIMEE
MIRANDA, a member of MIRR, had purchased a typewriter
about a year ago and that she could have made this
typewriter available to BOSCH. He possessed no specimens
taken from this typewriter. He claimed to possess no
information indicating that BOSCH or other members of the
MIRR had become involved in any extortion case.

For the information of the Bureau, it is
strongly suspected by this office that the Singer
typewriter purchased by MIRANDA is. the one which was ~
used in the first and/or third extortion letters in
this case. It appears that she has conveniently claimed
that she sold this typewriter to a man who is now dead
and whose wife possesses no knowledge of his ever having
acquired a typewriter. It is to be noted that a specimen
taken at the Singer Sewing Machine-Company of the same
model, a Singer T-4, as purchased by Miss MIRANDA reflects
that the typing is of the same type that appears in the
first and third extortion letters. : :
