Union. MR. PAIMER advised that a General Foreman, THOMA: 9 had come
plained that morning about the conduct of the subject, advising that he.

does practically no work and spends a great deal of his time in Union matters,
PAIMER indicated that according to the best figures he can obtain Local No,
108 collected $6300 in dues in February at $1.50 per person and also collected
$2000 in initiation fees. Of this amount, half goes to the International

! Headquarters, He stated that the United Automobile Workers are claiming that
' the present officers of the Local are ceasing to buy war funds with the dues
money collected and that he personally thinks that the dispute between the
two is due to the fact that. Local No. 108 is a very rich local, supposedly
having about $27,000 invested in United States War Bonds. He further believes
that this is the reason why the Intemational Headquarters of the Farm Equip-
ment Union is interested in controlling tais local and keeping them in the
Farm Equipment Union due to the International Union's poor financial cireum=
atances as reflected in the report at the convention last fall.
