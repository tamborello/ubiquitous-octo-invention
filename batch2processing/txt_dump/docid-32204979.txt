 

C. Surveillance of Dissidents

Mr. Warner was not consulted on any surveillance
projects. He was aware that informants had been put ina
construction crew building the Langley headquarters.

D. Loan of Equipment to Local Police Forces

. Mr. Warner was never asked whether it.was proper
for the Agency to loan equipment or personnel to local police
forces. He was generally aware of good relations maintained
by the Agency with local forces.

The Office of General Counsel was asked at the
time of the May Day demonstration to be the focal point for
coordinating actions with the Department of Justice. They
consulted with the Department of Justice about getting
marshals to protect the Agency. They had agreed that. the
CIA would pay travel expenses if marshals were brought in
from out of town. At the same time, the OGC was asked
whether it would be proper for the Office of Security ‘to
lend 50 hardhats to the Fairfax police should they need to
be used to protect the headquarters building. The OGC said.

yes.
E. Assassinations
Mr. Warner has no knowledge of any assassination.
- attempts.

F. Allegations in General

Mr. Warner has answered the above questions in
light of his personal acquaintance with the projects and his
acquaintance with general OGC knowledge. He says that many
projects may have been discussed by Mr. Howton with the DCI
without his ever being aware of their discussions.

IV. MISCELLANEOUS

At the time of the Patty Hearst kidnap, the FBI
asked the CIA to prepare profiles of the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA). The request was denied. Mr. Warner would guess
that there is no paper on the request, but that it was handled

in a morning staff meeting.

I. THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL (OGC)

: The Office of General Counsel has 14 lawyers...
All the lawyers except for one had been recruited from
within the rest of the CIA organization. There are a few .
other. persons in the Agency who handled legal functions

‘ outside the Office. of General Counsel: one OGC lawyer is.
detailed to logistics, three work in project MUTUAL, and
a lawyer works within the personnel office. Once a man is
assigned to the OGC, he normally stays there for the rest
of his CYA experience. Mr. Warner and one other lawyer are
the only men in the office who have been detailed elsewhere
in the Agency. The OGC is not divided along directorate
lines. Some lawyers have specialties, but they are

functional specialties.

The OGC is required to be consulted in a number
(1) it is consulted on all Section 7 alien ~
immigration cases; (2) it reviews all procurement contracts;
(3) it approves all administrative plans; (4) it approves
all liquidation plans; and (5) all regulations must be
approved by the OGC. Within recent years, it has reviewed
NSCID's and DCID‘s,. but there are no requirements for such

reviews.

The OGC has been consulted more regularly on

II. THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE CIA ACTIONS
RS OE HE CIA ACTIONS

Mr. Warner was in the Office of General Counsel
in OSS. He stayed on to work with the CIG and then on the
legal staff of the cta. He and Mr. Eouston were ‘in separate

' offices. Warner worked on the 1949 Act; Houston, on the

1947 Act.

Originally, Mr. Warner was involved in the

drafting of a comprehensive bill to he presented to Congress -

in 1947. This bill would have included the provisions which

Mr. Warner suggests that the Commission talk to
Walter Pforzheimer. He was the legislative liaison for the
CIG. He is retired and now lives in Washington.

reluctant to use words such as espionage. However,

Mr. Warner says that he doubts that Congress ever contemplated
that the CIA would ever conduct covert activities. He says
that a 1947 OGC legal opinion agrees that Congress did not
contemplate such activities. When such activities were

begun by the Agency, reliance was placed on. the President's
“inhérent power to conduct such activities. Congress has
‘ratified this authority by appropriating money over the
years. ,A 1962 CIA legal opinion expresses this view. It

was written in conjunction with the Department gf Justice,
which also wrote a legal Opinion at the time. OF

; : oF lote,.
Mr. Warner says the 1949 CIA act was not intended “/

to expand the functions of the Agency in any way. . He said
there were rumblings at that time about the need to conduct
Clandestine activities, but those were not taken into
“account in drafting the bill. -

; Mr. Warner is not sure why the word "collect"
was not included as one of the duties of the CIA. He says
that perhaps collection of data from. other sources was not
considered as collection of intelligence. The original —

: concept of the Agency was that it was to be primarily a
coordinator with some espionage responsibilities. He doubts
that any of the drafters of the legislation had any clear
concept of what the Agency would be doing 10 or 15 years
later. For many years, the other intelligence agencies
thought of the CIA as merely one person among equals. They
resisted allowing the CIA to have direction over their

activities.
III. ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE CIA

A. Mail Intercepts

activities. He was consulted only when it was decided to

end the activity.
