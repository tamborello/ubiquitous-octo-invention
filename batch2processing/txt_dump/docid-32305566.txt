RE: JOHN ROSELLI, aka

AR

Re Bureau airtel to Legat Rome dated 5/10/65.

There are attached hereto six copies of a
letterhead memorandum containing additional information
concerning TANCREDI and PARIGI TORTORA, which may be of
assistance to Legat. Rome in the interviews of these men.

Y TANCREDI TORTORA should be interviewed concerning
the shooting of ANTONIO CHARLANDO in Chicago, Illinois in
ig2e2 and the. identities of the five men arrested immediately
after the shooting should be ascertained. It is probable
that one of these men was TANCREDI TORTORA and it is possible
that. one of them was JOHN’ ROSSELLI. If, in fact, one of the
men Was ROSSELLI, this could be the reason he has so carefully
guarded his identity. TANCREDI TORTORA should also be
specifically. interviewed concerning his arrest in Chicago
in April, 1922 on a narcotics charge and the identities of
the two other men.arrested at the same time should be
established. :
A oth TANCREDI and PARIGI TORTORA should be requested
to furnish the names of as many persons as they can who. are
aware of ROSSELLI's dual identity. Also, they should be |

r requested to furnish in as much detail as possible a : :

chronological history oe ROSSELLI's activities as they
know them from the time he left Boston until they ceased
having contact with him. .

/ According to LA 4448-C-TRE, TANCREDI TORTORA and
ROSSELLI were close friends from the time they were young
men until they separated in the late 1920's or early 1930's.
TANCREDI was in the Los Angeles area in the 1920's as was
his brother, PARIGI, who at one time operated some type of
bar or liquor store in San Pedro, California. He -reportedly
sold this liquor store to an individual named PASQUALE
DI MARTINO. DI MARTINO was illegally in'the U. S. for a
number of years and was deported prior to World War II and

_ Was permitted to return to the U. S. after the war.

Referenced Bureau airtel. contains information on.
Page 2, Paragraph 1, that ROSSELLI sends money each year>
to his mother in Boston. It is. requested that the Bureau...
advise the Legat Rome that this information should not be : :
revealed to the TORTORA brothers during the interviews.
This information came only from LA hie CTE and it is very ;
probable that very few other people know about this. i
Therefore, the revealing of this information would definitely
jeopardize the security of LA 4448-c-TE. The fact that
ROSSELLI sends money to his mother is not a matter pertinent
to the type of information currently being sought concerning
ROSSELLI nor is it a matter concerning which the TORTORAs
are likely to have any knowledge.
