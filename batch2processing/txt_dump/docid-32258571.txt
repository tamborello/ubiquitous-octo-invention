: Il. Summary of Contact

“Investigators Robert Buras and L.J. Delsa met Mr. O'Sullivan ©

 

 

at his place of employment in the company with Mr. Boylston.

 

 

Mr, O'Sullivan stated that he knew Lee Harvey Oswald from

 

Beauregard Junior High at 4621 Canal St. Because the names

 

began with OS they sat. in the same home room. O'Sul@ivan

 

remembers Oswald dancing at intermission at school and how

 

he held himself erect. This made him think that Oswald would

 

 

be good in the CAP drill team. O'Sullivan talked three boys

 

into being interested in the Civil Air Patrol: Joseph Thompson,

 

 

Edward Voebel and Lee Oswald. O'Sullivan knew David Ferrie but

 

‘can not say that he ever saw Ferrie and Oswald together, He

 

doesn't remember Oswald from CAP activities. He could not

 

 

find any documents with both of their names on them TOF ‘tHE

 

 

Warren Commission and he did check with Lt, Pa ul Dyer for
_ Ferrie's plane at the airport. It wouldn't fly
IIL. Recommended Follow-up, (1£ any):

None, His testimony or deposition before ‘the Warren Commis-

 

‘sion might have. a litttle more detail because it was fresh |

 

-in memory at that time.
