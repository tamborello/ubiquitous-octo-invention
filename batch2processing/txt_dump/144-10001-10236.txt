M/R: (tm@6@) FOIA referral of a document containing a list of
the dates of NSA reports used by the CIA to compile records
pertaining to U.S. defectors to the USSR. The document was
located pursuant to a request for records between the CIA and
the-UvS. House Select Committee on Assassinations relating to
President Kennedy. 7 os
(@—e@ee3 The document with the NSA information is not
-classified in-and of itself. TIts-association with records - - -
pertaining to the Kennedy assassination is also not classified.
The association with the records pertaining to defectors to the
USSR, however, is classified SECRET-CCO. We are, therefore,
advising the CIA that the identification of NSA on the document
is to be redacted pursuant to b(1) and b(3)/403(d)(3). We ask
that CIA not name NSA as the source of the information or
redaction.
