SUBJECT: File Review at the FBI, March 16, 17, and 20, 1978
MANOLO RAY RIVERO aka MANUEL RAY, MANUEL REY

By memo of February 17, 1978, 1 submitted to you a review
of FBI file #97-4546, Section 1, Serials x-24 and mentioned
that two additional files were read by Patricia Orr.

Since no notes were taken on two files, I returned to the
FBI on March 16 to finish the review. At that time, I
found that additional material had been added to the
Manolo Ray section, and three days were required to finish
the assignment. This second review was done on March 16,
17 and 20.

Attached is a report of the information obtained from the
March file review on Manolo Ray. Also attached is a
suggested list of names and topics to be indexed from
this review, as the material read was extensive and not
all names are pertinent to this Committee.

Please note that the first file review on Manolo Ray has

been filed under #005990. For purposes of continuity, it
would be helpful if this number were assigned to the material
presented in this memorandum.
