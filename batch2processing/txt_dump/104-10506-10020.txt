c. DBA 78315 dated 19 August 1964 (FBI):

Concerns Andrew G. BUCKNER aka Andy BUCKNER, and "Little

Caesar", An FBI source reported that two employees of the Washington
Iron Works, Inc., Sherman, Texas told him that Harold TOTTEN, owner of
the business, and an employee, Andy BUCKNER, had made statements critical
of the U.S. Government and of high Government officials. Both TOTTEN and
BUCKNER reportedly had made so-called business trips to Mexico City in
the past. BUCKNER was reported to be purchasing agent for the firm.
BUCKNER had made remarkes among the firm employees that he believed Fidel
CASTRO of Cuba and Nikita KHRUSHCHEV of Russia to be smart people. Both
BUCKNER and TOTTEN criticised U.S. Govt policies and opposition to the
U.S. blockade’af Cuba. They criticized the policies of both Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson. A few days before Pres. Kennedy was assassinated
on 22 Nov 1963, BUCKNER remarked to some of the firm employees that he
had read news stories about President Kennedy's planned trip to Texas..and
thought "it would be funny" if something should happen to him. On the
afternoon immediately following Pres. Kennedy's assassination, BUCKNER
and TOTTEN were at the Iron Works, and after having heard of the
assassination, said it could not have been them because they were at the
Washington Iron Works at the time it happened. TOTTEN received newspapers
and literature from time to time in the names of John R. BRINKS and Thomas
E. EDWARDS. BUCKNER reportedly was hotheaded, thus the nickname "Little
Caesar."

/Have asked Ops Liaison to obtain photo.of BUCKNER from FBI to

determine if he is iden/with "Unidentified man".
