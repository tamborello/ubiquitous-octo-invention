likely have received demolitions training. In March
1965 POSADA was. recruited by the Agency to serve as a
Maritime Training Branch instructor in Florida. Information sg
at that time indicated that he already was reported to be ;
a "demolitions expert''. POSADA also was used as a source we
of information on Cuban exile activities. In 1965 POSADA
was involved with Luis SIERRA Lopez who was working with
Roberto ALEJOS Arzu, a Guatemalan who was attempting to
overthrow the Guatemalan Government. POSADA was of interest
to the SIERRA/ALEJOS group because of his knowledge of

9 demolitions and weapons. POSADA reported to the Agency

"| and later to the FBI, on his involvement in and the activities

organizations with which he became affiliated). As of
August 1966 he was used solely as an informant on the activities
of the Cuban Representation in Exile (RECE), a Miami-based
exile group. POSADA was formally terminatediin July 1967.
In August 1967 he was mentioned in a Havana Radio broadcast

DISIP).
