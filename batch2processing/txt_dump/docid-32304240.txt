 

Emilio Echarte Pedroso

While ECHARTE was in Puerto Rico, he wrote one or two
letters to his mistress who, he knew, would transmit them toMRS
In the Tetters he indicated he was proceeding with ssignmen
in Puerto Rico, although this was actually aicrue: te ea or
secret inksiwere used in his letters, only (a ouble-m g phrases (S)

ECHARTE said that inéone a4 his letters to his mistress,
he indicated, for the information of ae, that the mission (the plot)
to assassinate MANOLO RAY) was im » and he was abandoning
it. He said he subsequently tolapnns #1 telephone that every time CR)

-he saw RAY at his residence, RAY is children with him, and he |
could not assassinate RAY without killing the children, and he did
not want to do this, as it would adversely arouse public opinion.

ECHARTE said that although he used this excuse tokMRS pit was complete ly3Ki
false, and that when he left Cuba he had no intettion of assassinating
RAY. He insists he only accepted the assignment as a means of

getting out of Cuba.

ECHARTE stated he received no phone calls or letters back
from his mistress om€MRS¥while he was in Puerto Rico. He also asserted
he had no contact wi anyone from the Movimiento Bro Independencia de
Puerto Rico (MPIPR) or any other Puerto Rican independence organization,
After 20 to 25 days in Puerto Rico, he returned to Washington via
Eastern Air Lines on a one way ticket purchased in Puerto Rico. {

In @bout June, 1964, he returned to Puerto Rico and | -
registered at the Americana Hotel. The purpose of this trip, he said, |
was to spend time with a Dominican woman in whom he had become
romantically interested during his first trip to Puerto Rico. He
identified the woman as DULCE NARTDRQTNEDA who resided in the
vicinity of Fernandez duncos..and_1lthStreet.,..Santurces..Puerto
Rico. He stated he was unable to recall this woman's exact address
and insists that his contacts with her had nothing whatsoever to
do with Cuban intelligence,

ECHARTE remained in Puerto Rico about 45 days on this 1
occasion, He said he neither received nor sent any messages during l
this stay in Puerto Rico, and made no Cuban intelligence contacts j
with either Cubans or Puerto Rican Independists. He believes he
traveled via Eastern Air Lines both ways between Washington, D. C.
and Puerto Rico.

According to ECHARTE, "JACOBO" impressed Wim as being.faz
peasant or hillbilly type who had advanced rapidly to high
responsibility in the revolutionary government, He described Moncoso"
as a white male, about age 34, 5' 9", 170 pounds, With straight black
hair. ECHARTE presumes that "JACOBO" was either a nickname or a code
name, and insists he does not know this individual's true full name.

"JACOBO" was dressed in civilian clothes on both occasions ECHARTE met
this individual. .

. After ECHARTE had received telephonic instructions from
MRS¥to meet with "JACOBO" in Canada, ECHARTE then went to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) office in Washington,

D. C. to arrange for a re-entry permit so that he could return to

the United States after this proposed meet with "JACOBO". When

ECHARTE was unable to make the necessary arrangements with INS, he
placed another telephone call from Washington, D. C. toMRS inC aK)
Cuba. He informedgiRs e was unable to make the trip to Canada in time
to meet “JACOBO". ;

ECHARTE then suggested tore tha he might be able tog
travel to Mexico within a monthor two. RSMindicated this wouldc
be satisfactory, and that when ECHARTE arrived there, he should .
contact "MICKEY" at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. igs
that "MICKEY" would be alerted to expect a contact from "“POCHO"
(Cuban G-2 code name for ECHARTE).MRS¥told ECHARTE that "MICKEY" OX)
was a former acquaintance of ECHARTE, and furnished sufficient

information so that, ECHARTE,was able to recall "MICKEY" as the, former

bodyguard, of MANUEDK, pINETARQOS ADH also known as (red Beard". \@) -
“In about November or early December, 1967,ECHARTE placed

a telephone call from Washington, D. C. to "MICKEY" at the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico City. ECHARTE identified himself as "POCHO" in .

making this call, and indicated he would soon make personal contact in

Mexico City. "MICKEY" did not seem surprised to receive this phone
call and was apparently eXpecting contact from "POCHO".

MECHARTE said he was not surprised to learn that an
official of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City was a Cuban G-2 agent.
To the contrary, he stated, he would really be surprised to find
t¥tany official assigned to any Cuban Embassy was not a Cuban G-2
agent. He said it was the policy of the Cuban Government to send
Cuban G-2 agents to official Cuban establishments outside of Cuba
and this included those individuals who were assigned to the official
establishments as porters, handymen, and chauffeurs.

ECHARTE remained in Miami about 35 to 40 days before
proceeding to Washington, D. C. During this time he made a number
of trips to Key West while trying to sell the "Leda". He believes he
made the flight to Washington D. C. via Eastern Air Lines and upon
arrival in Washington, D. C., he moved in with his wife in a first
floor apartment at 3648 16th Street, Northwest. His wife was then
working as a domestic for a Mrs. MAHAM (phonetic). ECHARTE, while
in Washington, D. C., worked for a few days as a laborer with a
construction company, name now unrecalled. He said that he placed
one telephone call from his wife's telephone to his mother in Cuba,
but that he made no telephone calls to his mistress while he was
in Washington, D. C.

ECHARTE stayed in Washington, D. C. for approximately 20 to
30 days, then took a one-way flight from National Airport to San Juan
via Eastern Air Lines, he belé#ves. In Puerto-Rico, he resided in
‘a rented room in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He is uncertain of the exact
street address there, but believes it was Monserrate #708, He
obtained these accommodations in Santurce by walking the streets
looking for a rental, without help from anyone. He said he had made
no arrangenents to make any intelligence meet in Puerto Rico and
did not meet anyone for this purpose. However, in Puerto Rico, he
met two fromer Cuban acquaintances, CARLOS CRUZ and JORGE (last name
unknown). CRUZ was encountered on a bus, and ECHARTE met JORGE
(last name unknown) by chance on the street.

ECHARTE knew that MANOLOMRAY “was then employed as an
engineer in one of the departments of MUNOZ MARIN's Government. He
did ascertain through a telephone directory that RAY was then residing
at Urbanization Roosevelt in Rio Piedras, and one day he did walk
I through this area hoping to see RAY and to observe the specific area.
However, he did not see RAY that day, never made any further attempt to
locate RAY, and never actually saw RAY at any timewhile he was in
Puerto Rico.
