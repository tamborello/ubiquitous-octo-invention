1000 American dollars. His explanation for havin his
money was that it had been given to him by GEORGIA
in connection with purchasing a car for RAFT in gland.
The file contained an Interpol message from.Rome, Italy,
#525 dated 5/23/50, which reported the results of an
interview of RAFT, who was then in Rome, and RAFT in
effect confirmed the fact that he had given GAVENTA $1000
in connection with an automobile purchase. This is most
interesting since it shows an association between, RAFT
and GAVENTA dating back to at least 1950. by (un)

O'CONNELL advised that THEODORE LEWIN left
England via London Airport on 11/6/62 for the United
States, from where he planned to take a Caribbean cruise.

In connection with the Bureau's coverage of

any information obtained pertaining to GAVENTA, LEWIN
or the Friars Club. The Bureau is requested to furnish
any such information in a form suitable for dissemination

to New Seotland Yard.
