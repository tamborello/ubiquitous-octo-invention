CHAIN was in con act with an Austraiian (name unknown)
in Washington, D.C., whose friend was allegedly the head
of an anti-Castro organization. On one occasion in 1961
CHAIN gave Source $100.00 to give to the Australian to-
travel to Coral Gables, Florida, to meet a contact
reporting on anti-Castro activities. When the Australian
returned to Washington, D.C., he gave Source a large
envelope ahich Source turned over to CHAIN. The
Australian turned over similar material to a contact in
the Cuban’ ‘Embassy .-

.

CHAIN worked closely with Jose MOLEON Carreras, the Cuban

-delegate to the Inter-American Defense Staff of the OAS

in Washington, D.C, MOLEON was actively engaged in
gathering information and in buying publications concern-
ing southern U.S. ports, U.S. Defense Department books,
etc. ‘Source was not sure if MOLEON worked under the’ ~
direction of CHAIN. .

Source ‘recalled that CHAIN often appeared as though he
were afraid of ESCARRA who was a "Vieja Guardia" (Old
Guard Corrunist)., Source felt that CHAIN was not a
member of the Party. ~

CHAIN graduated from high school in Santiago de Cuba,
and, although he entered the University there as an
engineering student, he did not complete his studies.

He worked.in his father's grocery store in Palma
Soriano, Oriente Province and was a school teacher at
the Escuela de Cuadres Femeninos in Habana. In 1957

he was in the Sierra Maestra mountains as a captain in
the Rebel Army. In 1958 he was in the Isle of Pines
Prison. In early 1959 he was appointed "Coordinator
Provincial de Oriente." In this position he maltreated
the people of Santiago de Cuba, and an appeal was made
directly to Fidel CASTRO who made a trip to Santiago de
Cuba to personally investigate the trouble. As a result
of CASTRO's visit, CHAIN was transferred from Santiagp
de Cuba to a rempte location in the eastern part of
Oriente Province. The transfer was made only to appease
the populace of Santiago de Cuba and did not mean that
CHAIN claims to be close friends with Fidel CASTRO and
Carlos Rafael RODRIGUEZ Rodriguez.
