RELEAZRIN FULL CSI-0028/95.

30 May 1995

MEMORANDUM FOR: Fred Wickham
DO Focal Point for
JFK Records Review

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review
Group
SUBJECT: Request from the Assassination

Review Board (ARRB)

1. The ARRB has requested that we determine if the
names in the two attached documents (MEXI 7051 and 7045) are
releasable.

2. The attached Kostikov document (MEXI 7051) was the
subject of discussion at the 18 May meeting of HRG and DO
representatives with the ARRB to discuss Mexico City JFK
review issues. The document has been “Denied in Full” in
the original review. MEXI 7045 is a similar document which
was also denied.

3. The consensus of the DO representatives at the
meeting was that the Kostikov document could be released in
sanitized form. However, the names in the documents would
have to be checked for operational interest.

4. These documents are part of the materials being
prepared by the ARRB staff for an upcoming meeting of the
Board on 7 June. At that meeting the Board members will be
reviewing the documents that were subject to discussion at
the 18 May meeting plus additional documents that the ARRB
staff select as important to the “Mexico City” story.

5. Please provide a response by 2 June.
