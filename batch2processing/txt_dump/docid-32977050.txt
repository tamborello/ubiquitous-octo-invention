14 September 1962

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group (Augmented) on
Operation MONGOOSE, 14 September 1962

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy; the Attorney General; Mr. Johnson; Mr. Nitze,
General Lemnitzer, General Lansdale; General Carter;
Mr. Donald Wilson

1. The Group approved in principle General Lansdale's paper
of 31 August, with the amendments that had been agreed upon at last
week's meeting and which were attached to General Lansdale's memo-
yvandum of 12 September. However, Mr. Bundy made it clear that this
did not constitute blanket approval of every item in the paper and
that sensitive ones such as sabotage, for example, will have to be
presented in more detail on a case by case basis.

2. General Lansdale noted that he has asked appropriate people
in the Pentagon to draw up estimates covering requirements for person-
nel, space, commmications, etc., against the contingency that Cuban
operations will move into a more active phase and will require such
facilities. :

 

 

6. Mr. Bundy expressed his concern about the necessity for
linking planning in the political and military fields with the MONGOOSE
operations. He said that his tentative conclusion is that what is

â€œyequired is a tightly knit interagency group closely tied to the
MONGOOSE group but not a part of it. He said he would discuss this
concept with higher authority.
