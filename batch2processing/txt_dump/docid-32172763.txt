the late Pres. Kennedy. ao)

' Arnold, explained that since Oswald was:Considered a”
Communist then a wave of hysteria’ was about to explode
against the C. party of America but by the time “the

by the declaration of Russia that it was not the
C. party that had done it because Kennedy was a :
friend of the Working class but the work of the extreme
right or almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober”
the masses that it was the same caliber of people wh
had insulted Stevenson only Weeks before. in Dallas, me

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about. this
Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he
told them he gets 1 ots of letters of enquiry about the
C. party and he probe ly answered it as he does hundreds
of others and even sent him literature if he requested
it. They (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on the air with 4
