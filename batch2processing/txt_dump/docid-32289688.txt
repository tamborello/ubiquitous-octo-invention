\ It is the considered opinion at the Los Angeles.

Division that dissemination of information to the Department
concerning AUSA STEPHEN D, MILLER. as set out in Los Angeles
airtel to the Bureau, 4/14/67, could definitely compromise
LA 4476-C-TE. Since this source is now extremely close to
LCN Boss FRANK DESIMONE, it is not believed worth the risk
involved.

(*>

AUSA MILLER has openly announced his resignation
effective May 1, 1967.

Los Angeles will follow his activities in regard

to VICTORIA LOCKWOOD, through LA 4476-C-TE, and will keep
Bureau advised of pertinent developments.
