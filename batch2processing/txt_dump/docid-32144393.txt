"CACHITA' PROENZA PROENZA DE ROJAS, complained that Cuba has ;
become a police state and that Cuban authoriti have the (i
family."all tied up." ROJAS and his wife tolapiier 197¥that [&) )
a Cuban communist named JUAN MARINE is a friend of the family.
On one trip to Cuba, CACHITA ROJAS asked him to look into the
situation of her sister TERESA PROENZA to see how it could

“ be straightened out. MARINE recently visited Mexico "incognito" |
and informed the ROJAS that the situation now is extraordinarily
good but that TERESA was once under a death sentence because
she had dealt with LEE HARVEY CSWALD while assigned to the
Cuban Embassy prior’ to the assassination of JOHN F. KENNEDY.
Her ends nterceded for her and her life was spared. ROJAS 7
told piny 19af that MARINE warned them not to tell the Cuban © Kacy
Embassy in.lexico waty that he had spoken to them about this
matter, »

The source stated that JORGE ROJAS and his wife
do not know how to cope with the present situation, They
fear going to Cuba and they are speaking out against the Cuban
revolution in a most forthright manner. The bitterness dis~

played by ROJAS* wife fa egeds any that the source
can recall in the past. Cares

‘The source stated that some years ago, as best he
could recall, he heard JUANA LUISA PROENZA, a sister of CACEITA
who died some years ago, telling a similar story of how TERES
PROENZA was somehow involved with LEE HARVEY OSWALD at the
Cuban Embassy... At the time TERESA was employed at the embassy,
she lived with JUANA LUISA and another sister. Within the
family it has always been said that JUANA LUISA /worried herself
to death after TERESA was ordered to Cuba. Hi) ;

The Mexico City Office has conducted a review of

references to TERESA PROENZA especially those dealing with the

OSWALD investigation and it is noted that as set forth in ‘
exico City letter to the Bureau 1/24/64 in the OSWALD case v
EY 18 and MEX 19}fboth of whom have furnished reliable infor- BI

“ation in the past, reported on 1/13/64 that they had conversed

of a conversation she held with TERESA PROENZA. the Cultural

Attache of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. According to

MORA, TERESA PROENZA had told her that OSWALD walked in "cold"

to the Cuban Hmbassy and the first person he talked to was

PROENZA. Since PROENZA did not speak English, she turned him DY

A review of t oregoing material indicates
TERESA PROENZA got into trouble with the Cuban government more
as a result of her criticism of the handling of the CSWALU
. Matter following the assassination of President KENNEDY than
because of anything she did when SSWALD visited the Cuban
Embassy. Her harsh criticism of high Cuban officials (the
Ambassador and Foreign Minister) was apparently well known

in the embassy and hardly helvedc her case. [Mit fails to ~
