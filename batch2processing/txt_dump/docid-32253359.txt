Interview; Robert Genzman interviewed Joseph Goulden at his
home concerning an article which Goulden wrote in the Philadelphia
Inquirer on Decmeber 8, 1963, alleging that the FBI had tried
to recruit Lee Harvey Oswald as an informant in 1963.

Goulden stated that he obtained the story from two
sources--Dallas Deputy Sheriff Allan Sweatt (deceased) and an
individual he declined to identify. He stated that Alonzo
Hudkins was not a source.

' Goulden stated that he relied on the word of his sources
and never obtained any other evidence substantiating the alle-
gation. He believes that his sources relied in part on the
fact that FBI Special Agent James P. Hosty"s telephone number
was found in Oswald's notebook and possibly on the fact that
an informant number was found among Oswald's possessions after

his arrest on November 22, 1963. Goulden stated that his

memory on these matters is unclear.
