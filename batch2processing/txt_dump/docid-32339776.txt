[Seen him recently at a press conference on the occasion of
the visit ‘to Washington, KONSTANTIN G, PYSIN, Soviet,
Minister of Agricultures[' said he, himself, eats C$)
lunch everyday at the WN. estimates that BARSUKOV -
lunches there akout three times a week. He said that on
occasion he has happened to sit at the same table with
BARSUKOV. He said he assumed BARSUKOV considers him as a
reporter but is not aware of which news service employs him.
He described BARSUKOV as a personable individual who has
an excellent command of English although he speaks with an
accent He expressed the opinion that BARSUKOV is shy by

nature 1)
‘ [__]saia he is not acquainted with any other C$ 3
press representatives from Soviet bloc countries to the
best of his knowledge. He said he believed he had once met
a Yugoslav newSpaperman and he also recalled that
journalist was present at Cape Canaveral while nef BCS)
was there in connection with coverage of a rocket Taunching.
He remarked that this Pole was the first representative of

a.so-calleg Iron Curtain country to be present on such an
occasion.

of Tass (official Soviet ney) who appeared t,

It is noted that in discussing sarsuxov[ ICs‘)
laughingly remarked that if the U. S. Government were .
make a case against BARSUKOV and have him expelled from the

U. S., such action would no doubt result in the expulsion

of an American reporter from Moscow. In this connection,
reference was made to recent expulsion of American diplomats
from the Soviet Union, apparently on a retaliatory basis .6Q)

stationed there, Miss MOSBY was found unconscious and

partially disrobed in a gutter. He said she was jailed over-
night at th i d the incident was mentioned in

"Izvestia"™, said it was his understanding that CSI
upon her reléase the. following day Miss MOSBY was examined

at the American Embassy and it was determined that she had

been drugged. He said she h been charged with drunkenness
although she did not drink. Pp foaia that this episode CS)
was considered an attempt by e Russians to place UPI at

a disadvantage, so that in the event UPI should in ‘the

future incur the displeasure of the Soviet Government, they
coujd concoct a Similar incident and-have Miss MOSBY expelled
from the USSR with resultant publicity. He said that to aan oe
avoid such an eventuality, UPI transferred Miss MOSBY to Be
another post, thus terminating her career in Moscow. ~

Ceeratse related an alleged incident concern- Cs}
ing an unidentified British newsman who, it was stated,

returned to his apartment in Moscow one night where upon

as he walked in the door the lights were switched on and a

nude man was seen lying on the bed. At this point flash ;
bulbs went off and Russian agents present in the room =
addressed the British reporter by name with the obvious in- 4
tent of blackmail.

{ in his:conversation, made it clear that Cs3
he understands that the Russian journalists are official
representatives of the Soviet Government and-that as indicated |
above, he is under no illusions concerning possible methods
tion engaged in by the Russians. It is noted that .

information concerning BARSUKOV, ne could, with complete
