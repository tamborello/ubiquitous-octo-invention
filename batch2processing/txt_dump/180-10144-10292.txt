Whether or not any of the individuals listed below had
any relationship with the CIA, they may believe that actions
they have taken were at the direction of responsible persons
in the Central Intelligence Agency. Accordingly, in order for
the Select Committee to obtain truthful statements and ulti-
mately testimony from these individuals, it would be most use-

“ful for the Committee to have a letter from your office re-
leasing these persons of any obligations of secrecy they may
have made to the CIA, or to anyone whom these individuals may
believe was affiliated with the CIA.
