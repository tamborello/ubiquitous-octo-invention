MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Army Request for Information on Statements in
Warren Commission Report re Joseph DUTKANICZ
and Viadimir SLOBODA :

1. On 1 October 1964, Jane Roman of CI/Liaison telephoned
Lee Wigren to say that the Army had reacted to certain state—
ments (én page 266 of the Warren Commission Report) about the
assignment, KGB involvement and Army security investigation
of two former U.S. Army enlisted men - DUTKANICZ and SLOBODA.
The statements were contained in a classified memorandum of
6 April 1964 from CIA to the Commission. Through an error
by the Commission staff, this memorandum was quoted in the
report instead of a sanitized version which had been provided
for the purpose. CI/Liaison requested the factual background
of the statements as set forth in our classified memorandum.
Additional details on the Army's inquiry are set forth in
Jane Roman's memorandum for the record of 2 October (Attach-
ment A). .

 

 

2. Late in the afternoon of 1 October, Jane Roman explained
in detail to of SR/CI/R what was needed. Since
SR/CI/R keeps only a skeleton file on defector cases, some time
was required to find the exact sources and procure copies of
reference documents. This was done on 1 and 2 October.

 

 

3. Jane Roman informed[ sat mid-morning on
2 October that the Army wanted a written reply and that Chief/
prepare one if we provided the facts. Accordingly,
prepared a memorandum (Attachment B) and hand-
earrié o Jane Roman at 1200 hours.

 

 

4. Note: It was not possible to attach copies of all
documents cited in our memorandum because in one case a document
is in 00 files and in other cases there are only thermofax
copies available in the 201. This was explained orally to
Jane Roman.
