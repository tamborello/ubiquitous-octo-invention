that Alvarado was being treated cordialiy and that he was either
telling the truth or was the world's best liar. This officiai advised

that Alvarado's interrogation was continuing and that this interview

- would now be conducted in a little stronger | manner. He furnished no.
further elaboration on this statement but stated that Alvarado, who
‘is appar ently familiar with the interior of the Cuban Consulate, was
unable to pick out a photograph of Sylvia Duran from a group of * photos
of Female individuals.

On the evening of 11/29/63, Legat, Mexico, received informa-

tion from a high-level Mexican official that Alvarado reportedly admitted

kicking Castro out of Cuba. On 11/30/63, [Winn Scott, Chief, cial Mexico.

who were interviewing Alvaradd] that Alvarado had admitted that inforna-
tion furnished by him regarding Oswald's prese nce in the Cuban Embassy

Who- iS Véry Tamiliar v ‘Alvarado arrived In Mexico City on 11/29/63
-and during the last few hours of Aivarado's interrogation was in a room
adjoining that room in which Alvarado was being interviewed. As a

Vice Consul Azcue reportedly returned to Cuban on 11/18/63, Mexican
authorities have been recuested to assist in the possible identification
of the above-mentioned white male with Canadian passport and red-haired
_ Cuban Negro who aliegedly witnessed the pay-off to Oswald. However, it
appears that Alvarado's descriptions of those persons who reportedly
\witnessed | the pay-off are intentionally vague, thus making it impossibl
to identify or interrogate hewn and Lavine Ditran as the only logical
person available to- confirm ¢ or re fute Alvarado's statements, -
