MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Appreciation for Task Peformed

1. This is ‘to express appreciation for the excellent work
ed recently by the DCI Area Security Officer,
in responding to a high priority requirement. e
task involved making arrangements on an expedited basis to
have a secure facility (scif) constructed on the premises of
the Presidential Board that is responsible for assuring the
release of all government records related to the
assasination of President John Kennedy.

 

2. The requirement for the scif was triggered by a
request on 16 October 1996 from Judge John Tunheim, Chairman
of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), to CIA
Executive Director Nora Slatkin. Tunheim requested that the

Agency transfer a large volume of sensitive records to the
Board’s offices in Washington, D.C. Responsibility for the
documents was to remain with CIA, which meant that a
dedicated scif controlled by Agency personnel was needed.

3. It was thanks to Mr. initiative and
personal involvement at every step from beginning to
completion of the facility that the requirement was
fulfilled without delay. He promptly surveyed the location
proposed for the scif, discussed the security details and
costs directly with the Board's Executive Director, and
contacted appropriate CIA components to assure the
installation was completed promptly and security
requirements were met. Throughout the entire process he was
diligent about’ keeping our office fully informed on the
progress of the project.

 

 

4. Mr. deserves a good deal of credit for his
fine efforts, which were key to the Agency’s success in
meeting its commitment to the Presidential Board.
