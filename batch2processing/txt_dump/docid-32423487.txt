lsungecr: Preliminary Staff Paper on Assassination

 

Attached you will find a preliminary staff paper entitled "Assassina-

ition: Authority and Control." This paper has been prepared by a member

of the Command and Control Task Force and is directed toward the key is- a
sues of authority, initiation, and control. The purpose of the paper is :
‘to assist you in preparing for the senior level witnesses that are ap-

pearing before the Committee this week. The paper contains a number of

‘findings which, although the views of the author, should be helpful in

sorting out the various issues and themes regarding assassination that i
have been developed by the Select Committee to date.

 

This paper has been prepared relying on the testimony of the wit-
messes who have appeared before: the Select Committee (through the —
Harvey testimony of. June 25), documents introduced as evidence during
tthe hearings, and materials already received by the Committee re-
lating to the CIA's legal authority in the’ field of covert action opera-—
itions and Special Group procedures. Documents received from the cra, :
the State Department, the White House and the Presidential libraries have :
not been incorporated into this paper. Therefore, the findings of this -
Paper must be considered preliminary, awaiting either confirmation or
revision in light of new evidence developed by the Committee through its
future hearings and its review of documents recently received from the —
Rockefeller Commission, the National Security Council and the Presiden-
tial libraries. .

 

The paper is divided into three sections. The first contains back- i
ground information on the CIA's authority for covert action operations’
during the period under investigation, the role of the Special Group
during this period, and the concept and practice of "plausible deniability"
and how it relates to assassination.’ The second section summarizes what
the Committee has learned through executive session testimony on the
Castro, Trujillo, Lumumba, and Diem assassinations or assassination at-~-
tempts, as well as the ZRRIFLE project. The third, and final, section
summarizes and highlights the important findings of the Committee to
date as well as the key issues developed by the Committee up to this
time.
