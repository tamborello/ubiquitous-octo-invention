Le patasonnon REPORTS” SOVIET REACTION TO ASSASSINATION OF
U.S. PRESIDENT- - . . .

_29 Nev. 63

 

b (iii)

Reference repercussions in the Soviet Union to the assassination
of President KENNEDY. :

Basing the first on personal judgment and the others on reports
from reliable diplomatic sources, I will give the,- following. evalua-
tions:

The deep grief produced here by. the’ pasasdinatioy was
‘absolutely spontaneous. and can be explained by thé high .culture ord
the Soviet people, which enables them tq‘rise above world events,.
and by traditional Russian sentimentality.

The moment the news was received, hacauge of ‘the possibility, of
international complications the military authorities increased ehety
‘security measures. These have _now returned. to normal.

High-ranking Soviet officials are concerned over what interna: .
tional policy the new President will pursue, especially with respect
‘to Cuba, and, although at seems that MIKOYAN's feelings, after
speaking with. the President and other’ high-ranking United. States
officials, were moderately calm, -Soviet leaders are waiting to learn
how the matter of the purchase of wheat in the United /States will be
resolved and also’ for the conclusion of a new Soviet- United States

cultural agreement, in order to obtain a more clear igea of the. above-

mentioned policy. :
