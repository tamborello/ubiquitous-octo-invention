ANGELO BRUNO attended this wedding. It was also pointed out
that BRUNO was related by marriage to the MAGGIO family.

In November 1959 PH T-2,. who had recently been
closely associated with’ ANGELO BRUNO, advised that BRUNO's
numbers activity was "positively" being maintained in the
Maggio Cheese Company, llth Street and Washington Avenue,
Philadelphia.

On December 30, 1959, PH T-10 advised that during
the previous week MIKE BRUNO, son of ANGELO BRUNO, was observed
at the Maggio Cheese Company. MIKE BRUNO told PH T-10 that
ANGELO BRUNO was around and was doing "okay." This informant
commented that ANGELO BRUNO had "lots of money."

On February 12, 1960, PH T-2 told of a recent visit
to the Maggio Cheese Company, at. which time MARIO MAGGIO, who
operates the MAGGIO family business, told the informant that
Internal Revenue Agents were examining his books at that’ time.
MAGGIO commented that the books that the agents wanted to

- examine would never be made available and the books that they

were looking at were in perfect order. MARIO MAGGIO told the
informant that ANGELO BRUNO was not around due to the agents
being at the company.

Informant told of another visit to the Maggio Cheese
Company where he observed numerous men contacting ANGELO BRUNO
and MARIO MAGGIO in the office located on the northwest corner
of the property at lith Street and Washington Avenue. ‘The in-
formant said that these men contacting MAGGIO and BRUNO did not
enter through the front main entrance, but came into the offices
from a door leading from the platform area leading to the front
offices. The informant stated these men gave MAGGIO and BRUNO
money, which he presumed were receipts of numbers activity and
so forth for that day.

Informant stated that he was of the opinion that other
numbers activity is conducted in the offices of Milkmaid Dairy
Products, 1130 South llth Street, a subsidiary of the Maggio
Cheese Company and located in the same building with the cheese
company. .

informant said that he had seen PHILLIP TESTA talking

BRUNO in this contract would have to bid for the contract but
that it appeared that this bid would be only to comply with
formality.

On December 21, 1959, PH T-2 said that he had been -
consulted by BRUNO and his associates regarding the securing
of a contract for the City of Philadelphia after conference
with Councilman ROSE. Informant said that it now appears that
the original deal would not go through due basically to strong
opposition developed near the proposed dumping site in Salem,
N. J. Informant was reported to have discussed with ROSE the
possibility of handling garbage disposal and dumping in Tinicum
Township, Delaware County, Pa., which according to the informant,
may have in some way brought about the present situation in
order that the informant could secure the contract for himself.
Informant pointed out that if he secured the contract, BRUNO
would in no way enter into the business. ;

Philadelphia Inquirer December 23, 1959, reported
that a "storm of opposition" developed being led by the Mayor
of Bridgeton, N. J., and a State Senator from Cumberland
County, N. J., all opposed to using grounds for the’ dumping
of refuse, based on the danger to health and loss of natural
wildlife. This newspaper account, apparently having reference
to the property previously mentioned in Salem, N. J.,
identified the operation proposed as being "The Delaware-
Philadelphia Disposal, Inc.” .

On February 18, 1960, PH T-2 advised SA DALE M. HIESTAND
that the property which BRUNO and others were attempting to
purchase in Salem, N. J., for disposal of Philadelphia garbage
was condemned by the State of New Jersey.

The informant believed that the State of New Jersey
purchased the property, and in view of this, the venture to
obtain a contract from the City of Philadelphia for removal of
trash from the city va water to Salem, N. J., collapsed.

The Philadelphia "Evening Bulletin" dated March 7,
1960, contained an article captioned "WAGNER. Bars City Dumping
on N. Jd. Wildlife Refuge." -

This article, bylined by ROBERT J. EISLER, stated that
the City of Philadelphia had blocked a Philadelphia Street
