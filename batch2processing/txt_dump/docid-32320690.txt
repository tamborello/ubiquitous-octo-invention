Dear Mr. Rumig:

moe On 10/26/92, President George Bush signed "The John F.
Kennedy (JFK) Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992."
This Act requires that Government records related to the
assassination of President Kennedy be sent to the National
Archives for public release. It was passed because of the
renewed public interest in the release of all JFK records and it
facilitates the release of information normally exempt from
disclosure under Executive Order and/or the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA).

While the Act contemplates maximum disclosure of JFK
records, information can be withheld if certain requirements are
met. Withholding information is referred to as "postponement"
because the Act provides that in 25 years, all information must
be released unless the President of the United States certifies
that particular information should never be released. Attached
is a copy of the Act which specifies the bases for any
postponements and describes the Review Board which will determine
the validity of such postponements claimed for JFK assassination

records. C _ “$2 GDa8 t } f qe

The FBI has established a task force™to process
the JFK assassination records. The FBI's goal is to maximize
release of ‘information. Postponements will only be requested
where there is compelling justification for doing so. This
letter serves to inform you that pursuant to the Act the FBI will
be required, in the absence of such justification for
postponements, to release all information received from agencies
such as yours that relates to the JFK Assassination and to
identify the source agency. This requirement is limited to the
JFK investigation and the documents defined by the 1992 Act and
should not affect any future handling of your agency's
information concerning other subjects.
