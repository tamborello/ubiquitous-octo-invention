Union Affairs, U. S. Department of State. Certain leads re-
sulted from this review, but subsequent investigation of the
leads did not identify the unsub.

Since the submission of relet, interviews have been
conducted with a number of State Department and U. S. Infor-

‘Moscow; with the former U. S. Air Attache, one of his assistants

with appropriate personnel of the Air Attache Division, USAF;
and with the Air Force officer who was in charge of the Foreign
