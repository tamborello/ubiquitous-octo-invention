ENCLOSURES (2)
TO BUREAU

Two copies of a letterhead memorandum.setting forth the
characterization of the informants utilized in instant report.

ADMINISTRATIVE:

; On 12/27/62, Mrs. JOSEPH GRAMMARINO, 347 4th St., Brooklyn,
NY, wife of JOSEPH GRAMMARINO,..advised her husband leaves for work .
each day at approximately 8:00 AM. However, she disclaimed .any
knowledge relative to his place of employment. She further refused
to furnish any information regarding his availability for an inter-
view, but stated that she would advise him to contact the NYO.

It may be noted that on 3/30/62, NY 3597-C* advised that
the subject had in his possession the name "Little Joe, ST 8-8102".
Telephone no. ST 8-8102 is listed to the aforementioned individual.

On 12/28/62, Mr. HOWARD KREITSEK, Syosset - Woodbury
Road, Woodbury, LI, NY, was interviewed at the NYO. At the outset
of the interview, Mr. KREITSEK requested that he be allowed to
chronologically furnish the details of his association with the
subject without interruption. Thereafter, he stated that he would
repeat the details so that notes could be taken relative to the
matter. Mr. KREITSEK spoke. for.a period in excess of two hours, ;
during which time he advised that he was forced to pay approximately
$28,000.00 to GRANELLO and GEORGE LEVINE under the threat of bodily
harm to himself or his family.

KREITSEK stated that he still lived in extreme fear of the
-subject and LEVINE. Therefore, he would not testify against the
subject in a court of law. However, he stated that: he would be
willing to cooperate in any other possible manner. In this regard,
he suggested that he may be able to develop some information ,
concerning GRANELLO through his, KREITSEK's, close friendship with
ROCKY GRAZIANO. KREITSEK described GRAZIANO as a close associate |
of the subject, who is probably cognizant of most of the subject's
activities, ;

; Due to the lateness of the hour at the conclusion of
KREITSEK's recitation, arrangements were made to recontact him
in the immediate future to record the details of his association ~
with the subject. KREITSEK requested this recontact since he had
another appointment immediately following the interview. In the
meantime, KREITSEK stated that he would endeavor to develop, through
GRAZIANO, some information concerning the subject's current activities

On several occasions during January, 1963, Mr. KREITSEK
telephonically contacted the NYO, but stated that due to business
committments he was not available for an interview. However, he
advised that he had been in contact with ROCKY GRAZIANO, but was
unable to develop any pertinent information concerning the subject.

By communication dated January 31, 1963, the Los Angeles
Division furnished the following information: :

JOY RAHE presently resides at 1737 Sunset Plaza Drive,
Los Angeles, California. This is a private residence in an
exclusive section high in the Hollywood hills. She has not been
interviewed to date due'to the fact that telephone checks are being
made at the present time in an attempt to ascertain her contacts.
It is anticipated that she will be interviewed in the near future.

The information developed at the NY Telephone Company
and set forth in instant report, was furnished by Mr. EDWARD L,
BRAUNE, Security Supervisor, NY Telephone Company, 4 Albany St.,
NY 6, NY. so
