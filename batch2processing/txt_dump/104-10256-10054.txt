4 Eeference is also nade to a 24 March 1975 mensorandum

in tre file of the above mentioned former Agency employee, Walter
Josef MACKEN, specifically augresting DL. ACKEM's recent involve-

meat in paramilitary activities--which would appear to coincide with
the activities of "Friends of Abaco''--at a place in Georgia, not far)
frors Atlanta, This memorandun: also relates that MACKEM is cure
rently encployed as a private investigator in the Washington, B.C, area.
5. #il cf the foregoing would suggest that Walter Joeef MACKEM
and John Fatricih. }. ULICON are employed by Security Congultents,
International, a subeicdiary of the Atlanta based Central Investigative
Agency, Hnc.; and tuat Ceutral Investizative Agency, Inc,, ie involved
in the activities of “Friends of Abaco” and AIK.

4 The Central Investigative Agency, Inc., Hle also contains

@ copy of a cable {IN 304569), dated 1] July 1974, from the Atlante
preies Base reporting in substance that information had been received

through the FEI originating with Howard CIBSCH (believed identical with
the aforementioned Heward KR. GIESCN), that the Washington, D.C. office
of the Central Investigative Agency, Inc., had been sub-leased to the
Drug Enforeerent Adroinistration and was being vaed by the Central
lutelligence Apency as an electronic surveillance listening poet. GIBSCN
claimed that thia activity was headed by a Central Intelligence Agency
officer, one CONEEN {phonetic}.

7. CONEEN is beHeved identical with former Staff ernployee
Lacien BE, CONEIN who was last knows to be working-with the Drug -
Esforcement Adrsisistratios. Tre file of the aforementioned Walter
Josef MACKER reflects that he was detailed by the Agency to the Drug
Enforcemest Administration from February 1972 te October 1973; and
that as of September 1973, CONEIN was an associate of MACKEN.

8. Itis believed that the employment of former Agency employees
by “CIA and the backing of "CIA" of the Abaco Independence Movement
could cause future concern for this Agency.
