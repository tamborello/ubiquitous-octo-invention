I believe we have lived up to those promises.

Phono (Area 202) §44-6000

You have talked to the personnel who conduct security-typel
investigations and who aré personally involved in every facet
of our day-to-day intelligence operations.

You have attended numerous briefings by FBI officials who
have sought to familiarize the Committee and its staff with
all major areas of our activities and operations in the national
security and intelligence fields.

In brief, you have had firsthand examination of these
matters that is unmatched at any time in the history of the

Congress.

As this Committee has stated, these hearings have, of
necessity, forcused largely on certain errors and abuses. I
eredit this Committee for its forthright recognition that the
hearings do not give a full or balanced account of the FBI's
record of performance.

It is perhaps in the nature of such hearings to focus
on abuses to. the exclusion of positive accomplishments of the
organization.

The Counterintelligence Programs which have received the

lion's share of public attention and’ crjtical comment constitu

The Staf£ has advised the Committee that under Director
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse. The
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli

gence operations, and less on purely domestic surveillance.

  
    

The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in
developing policies and standards for intelligence. These
are welcome developments.

Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved.

Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress
should take into account in thinking about the future of
FBI intelligence. Among these issues are whether FBI surveil-
lance should extend beyond the investigation of persons
likely to commit specific crimes; whether there should be
outside supervision or approval béfore the FBI conducts certai
types of investigations or uses certain surveillance technique
whether foreign related intelligence activities should be
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement
functions, and what should be done to the information already
‘in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in
the future.

The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange

of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney

the Honorable Clarence M..Kelley, the Director of the Federal

e e@ 2448
Bureau of Investigation.

Mr. Kelley was appointed Director in July of 1973 ina
troubled. time for the FBI. His experience as an innovative
law enforcement administrator in" charge of the Kansas City
Police Department for over ten years, and his previous work as
a Special Agent of the FBI have made him uniquély qualified
to lead the Bureau.

The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation
extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over
the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the
openness of the FBI's witnesses before this Committee, and
their willingness to consider the need for legislation to
clarify the Bureau's intelligence responsibility.

It is important to remember from the outset that this
Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's
activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic
intelligence operations. We have consistently expressed our
admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative
and law enforcement work, and we recognize the vital importanc
of counterespionage in the modern world. But domestic
intelligence has raised many difficult questions.

The Conmittee has also concentrated on the past rather

 

than. on present FBI activities. The abuses brought to light

in our hearings occurred years and even decades before Directoy
