years of my time, working abroad. I returned to Washington
where I then became overt in the sense of I worked in the

offices and was no longer ostensibly a private businessman.

I served as what is known as & Case officer in the Europaan

area.

Mr. Baron. About what time period would you say?

Mr. Hedgman. It was '53 to early ‘57. Early ‘67 until
the mid-60's I served in Europe working primarily on Soviet
operations.

Mr. Dawson. I think you might have misspoken. You sald
mid-60's, early '57 to mid-60's. Did you mean 1960?

Mr. Medgman. Mid-1969, yes, I would correct that. From
July 6 on until -- 1 can't remember whether it was June or
July of 1963 I served as Chief of Station in then Leopoldville,
now Kiershasa, Zaire. I was Chief of Station. 1 than returned
to Washington in the early fall, the exact dates T don't recall,
of 1963, and I was what is known as a Branch Chief. I was
responsible for the sastern half of Africa from 1963 to June
of 1965.

June of '65 till June of °67,

‘

I raturned to Washington whera I became Branch Chief
again for the Southeast Asian area for a very brief tima. In
essence it was to prepare me for my next assignment which was
the Chief of Station, Vientiane, Laos.

of the African Division, January, 1971 until Dacember, 1971, at
which time I became Chief of the Division and remained Chief

which occurred nearly fifteen years 490, some fifteen years,
some slightly more, some slightly less. So therefore, I will
make every effort, but again, I am stressing this fact that 1

files or anything of tha sort.

Mr. Hedgman. I just want this -- T am making this point
for the Committees members. I have already made it to you

you to discuss events that took place almost fifteen years ago,
