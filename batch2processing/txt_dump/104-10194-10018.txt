THE SUPPRESSED STORY
can now be tid of how the
Central Intellicence Agency
organized a Cudana exile raid
on Cuha’s key off refinery in
1903 Dut aborted it after the
assassination of President

Kennedy.

Insiders sav the corporate
oil giants, hoping eventuatly
to recover their property in
Cuda, brourht quict pressure
to quash any raids upon ree
fineries. Lyndon  Jebnson,
who canceled the raid after
succeeding hiv, Kennedy 11
the White House, was close
to Texas oi Interests.

We have learned the dra-
matic details from Bradley
Ayerg, a 36-year-old foriner
‘Army captain, who was se-
lected by the CIA to train
Cuban exites for infiltration
and assault missions Inctud-
ing the refinery faid in Ma-
tanzas province.

We have checked out
Ayers’ story with our own
sources, who confirm he is
correct about names, places
and dates. From a group of
pictures, Agers slo wes able
to pick out finmediately a
CiA undercover operative
who we knew had been In.
voived in the CIA raids
against Cuba. .

The rugged Ayers, a for-
mer Army ranger Instructor,
trained the refinery raiders.
The recruiling for the mis-
sion had already been com-
pleted before he was as
signed to the project. CTA of-
ficiala. took him by motor
jJaunch through swampy Ever-
gisdes canals and Across the

glades as training siteg.
f the Cubans,” said
Ayers, ere bank clerks,
busbeys, waiters, musicians,
laborers, men who had fied
to the United States. -Many
had never fired a apon.
They were disorganized and
undisciplined. I got the job
of reorganizing the training
program.”
