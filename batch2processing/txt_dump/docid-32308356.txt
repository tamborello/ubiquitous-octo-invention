Dear Mr, Sipes:

This Depacrment currently 8 under consideration the
possible prosecution of one Frank” Fiorini, of Miami, Florida,
for exporting munitions of war in violation of Part 126.01,
Title 22, Geode of Federal Regulations, and Seetion 1934,

itle 22, United States Code,

Aecording to the information which we have received,
Piorini and two other men travelled by automobile from Miami,
Florida to Mexico via Brownsville, Texas, At the time when
they entered Mexico on about April 12, 1967, they wera carrying
eertain explosives and detonating devices. The alleged purpose
of this activity was to damage some Cuban ships in Mexico. It
was subsequently decided that the venture wag too risky, and
the explosives were buried at an isolated spot in the vicinity ;
of Giudad Mante, Tamaulipas, Mexico, where they were subsequently
recovered by Mexican authorities. We have received a translation -
of a report on this matter prepared by Jose Maria Navarro Barquero,
Department of Military Industry, Tecamachaleo, Mexico City.

The FBI has advised us that an official of your Office ©
stated that additional descriptive data or chemical analysis ‘ .
is necessary in order to make a determinetion as to whather the
explosives in this case are on the Munitions List. We havo

been advised further that these explosives are still in the

possession of the Mexican Army at the Department of Military

Industry and that the Mexican Army has the capability of

conducting an analysis to determine the chemical composition

of these explosives. FBI INFO
