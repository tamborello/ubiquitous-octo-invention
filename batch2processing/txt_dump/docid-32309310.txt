the same manner as in three previous letterhead memoranda
(dated 11/7,8,and 12/63) containing information from the
- Mr. French had previously requested that
| lidentity be concealed because of the confidential
asis upon which the information had been furnished to him
by (_ ~Jana the sensitive nature of the matter in which |
the Department was seeking cooperation, particularly
the possibility of an attempt to influence the judge or jury

DE 29-1432

Inasmuch as the Bureau has advised in reairtel
that the LHM will be disseminated only to the Criminal
Division of. the Department, there is no known reason for
[identity to be concealed, other than Mr. French's
original request, as mentioned above. Mr. French probably
will not be available at Detroit for further discussion of
this point prior to next week. If the Bureau desires to
withhold dissemination of the LHM until that time, it will
be determined from him e is any objection at
this time to aisclosing|—-]identity in the LHM, and
if there is no objection by m, an amended LHM will be

submitted immediately. Otherwise it isbelieved the LHM
could be disseminated in its present form.
