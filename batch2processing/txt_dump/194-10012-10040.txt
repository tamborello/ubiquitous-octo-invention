ATS USACSD believes that Alphs 66 has an excellent potential
to obtain military information from Cuba and also items of Soviet Ordnance

materiel, Exploitation of Alpha 66 by USAOSD indicates that the following
factors should be (considered Jeareful ly:

a. if USAOSD attempted to coordinate the operational use of this
organization with CIA, it is believed that CIA would request that the
operation be turned over to them for exploitation.

be Alpha 66 appears more properly an action type organization
engaged in combatting Communism by armed force than a clandestine organization,
and might be better utilizad by General Landdale's shop.

oe It is considered possible that the activities of Alpha 66 might
have upset the current negotiations of Mr Donovon to effect the release
of the Cuban prisoners, and consequently a policy decision might be made at
the highest Level to nullify Alpha 66, Further activities of Alpha 66 might
upset political negotiations at the highest level, and reactions might affect
any branch of the government assisting Alpha 66 in any manner,

ad. Iv is interesting to note that Carlos Prio Socarros climbed on
the bandwagon on 14 October and in a radio comment indicated that he was
going to effectively support armed resistance to Castro. If he should begin
contributing lazge sums of money to Alpha 66, and/or engage in similar
activities, it could further upset national policy at the highest level.
This could subsequently affect OACSI and USAOSD, depending upon reactions
to events, USA@SD is currently engaged in exphoiting Socarras's political

group, the PRC.
De Recommended that:

a, USAOSD present involvement with Alpha 66 be made explicitly
clear to interested Divisions of OACSI,

b. Further utilization of Alpha 66 by USAOSD be clarified by
Operations Branch, Callection Division, in view of the many ramifications,

Ge That USAOSD be authwized to exploit Alpha 66.

d. That ONI be contacted for jntelligence interest in Soviet UDT -
countermeasures.

e, That utilization by General Lansdalefs group-be investigated.
