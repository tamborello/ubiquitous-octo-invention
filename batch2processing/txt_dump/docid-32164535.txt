the past, on 12/2/63 made available a copy of a mimeographed “"\
flier entitled "Who Really Murdered Pres. Kennedy?" which was ‘|
issued by "The Communist Party of Illinois, Room 806, 36 W.

Randolph St., Chicago, Illinois." Source informs that this
document was being distributed by personnel of the Illinois CP
on 12/1/63 in the Chicago area, Urging that "only the Ultra-
Right and the Southern Racists" had something to gain by killing
"a president pledged to Negro equality," ‘this document stresses
that "Dallas is a stronghofd of the Ultra-Right" and the "John
Birch Society" and raisgé/questions 26 to whether the murder of
the alleged perpeeert eo arey was not brought about by local
Texas authorities to silence him. In this connection emphasis
is laid on the point that "Oswald (was) kept “on tyo da ithout
the right to see counsel." Ol - <_<

Concerning OSWALD's background, the ea
"The police say he was a member of the Fair P1¢y,
Committee and of the American Civil Liberties $a Sxecus Yet both of
these organizations deny such membership. The pglice-sry mre“was
pro-Communist, yet the anti-Castro Cubans in this country say tnat
he offered to work for them. The police say that he applied
sometime back for Soviet citizenship, and been denied. Who
really was he? An adventurer who was made the ‘fall guy' by
higher ups? A dupe? Or an innocent victim? What is the truth?"
