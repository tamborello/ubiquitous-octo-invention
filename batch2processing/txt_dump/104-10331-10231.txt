Some followup questions on the ARRB query: How will the answers to the 10 questions be used? Will the answers just be used by the

staff, or will they be made public? (if public, in what form?) What about attribution: will the involvement /
providing the answersbe made public? Will the information be attributed)

Please note that th ‘oreign Secretary/may be.called upon by the oppositien-controlled congress in the next couple of weeks or

50 to testify in open session about CIA involvement i} This would greatly raise the political protilefof any business we do with )
a something like the ARRB stuff that might become public.)
