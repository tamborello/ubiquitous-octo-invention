He is President of Brigade 2506 in Miami, Florida.
The Brigade 2506 consists of Cuban exile veterans of the
Bay of Pigs invasion April 17, (O)” He was recently elected

to this position.

CARBALLO was’ asked by SA GUTIERREZ if he attended a
meeting in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, during the first
part of June, 1976 where members of Accion Cubana, FLNC, ,
Brigade 2506, Movimiento Nacionalista Cubano, and Movimiento 17

very proud to have served as a U. &. officer. Because
of his strong belief that he must not embarrass the United
States or put it in any adverse position with neighbors in
the hemisphere of the world, he has always felt that actions
against FIDEL CASTRO aust originate from abroad and take

place abroad. He is aware of the provisions of the Neutrality

Act but his reason for believing that anti-CASTRO actions

must all take place abroad is that,he does not. went to see
problems for the United States. ‘)

\ Mr. CARBALLO stated that he is concerned that the
communist regime of FIDEL CASTRO recently captured three ,
Cuban fishing beats with nine Cuban exiles on board. One of
the persons on board was a child. These people have been in-
carcerated in Cuba and he feels that no action has been taken
against Cuba for this piracy. Im fact, Mr. CARBALLO stated
the press has played down this criminal act of the commmist
regime of Cuba. He stated that the fishing vessels aN were

captured are the "Mako," "Canario," and "Miguelito.

 

Me. CARBALLO advised that he is very much aware that
Miami Cuban exiles ORESTES RUIZ HERNANDEZ and GASPAR JIMENEZ
were arrested in Mexico and charged with an attempt to kidnap
the Republic of Cuba's Consul in Merida, Yucatan, Hexico, on
or about July 23, 1976, in which a Cuban national was killed.
He knows GASP®R JIMENEZ personally, but he does not know RUIZ
HERNANDEZ. He knows about their problems because of nevs
releases which he has read, He denied having any prior knowl-
edge of the act these men are accused of having committed.
He advised that he did not aid or directly support GASPAR .~
JIMENEZ or his accomplices in carrying: out the kidnap attempt
in Mexico. He would eather not say who is directly support-
ing GASPAR JIMENEZ in other matters. He stated that everyone
does what, he issrpposed to do or feels that he shouldds in’
the fight against comaunism. He emphatically denied having -.
any knowledge concerning the kidnap attempt of the Cuban Consul
and the killing’of the Cuban naticnal in Mexico. He OG) 5 2)
