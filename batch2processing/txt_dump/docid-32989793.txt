Hi USE ‘SELECT COMMITTEE ON _ASSASSINATIONS

On August 28, 1978, Special Agent (SA) Robert
F. Pevahouse, Berkeley Resident Agency, Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), was telephonically contacted by
Mike Eberhardt, House Select Committee on Assassinations.
He was furnished the residence address and telephone
number of SA Pevahouse.

Mr. Eberhardt inquired about the fugitive
investigation of James Earl Ray during the time Ray
was an Unlawful Flight fugitive. He was told SA Pevahouse
received a lead from another office to contact Jerry Ray,
brother of James Earl Ray, who was living in Northbrook,
Illinois at the time. Jerry Ray was contacted telephon-
ically by SA Pevahouse at which time Jerry advised he had
not seen or heard from his: brother since prior to his
escape from prison, Jerry -Ray also furnished information
he had concerning other members of the family, including
John Ray, none of whom were in the Chicago area. It was
the recollection of SA Pevahouse that John Ray was in the
St. Louis area at the time. SA Pevahouse could not recall
specific time of interview as to number of months prior to
assassination of Martain Luther King. He noted there were
no other relatives or associates of James Earl Ray inter-
viewed in the.Chicago area to his knowledge.

Concerning the investigation after the assassina-
tion of Martin Luther King, Mr. Eberhardt inquired as to
knowledge of any specific records from the Sportsman's
Club in Northbrook, Illinois, to show if Jerry Ray was
working at the time of the assassination. SA Pevahouse
stated he could not recall at this late date any specific
records concerning the dates worked, but, as he recalled,
personnel at the Sportsman's Club- had indicated Jerry Ray
was there except during regular days off.

This documents contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your
