the President probably did not know of the gun transfer, but he said
that the assassination and the U.S. role with respect to it would have
come as no surprise to the President. He doubted that the CIA even
would have had to clear the transfer, although a general policy of that

_ sort might have been passed by the Special Group.

Goodwin reported no other mention of assassinations. [In fact,
he said he once heard a CIA man say that assassination was a bad idea
because once started, it never ended. However, an agent in the field
might regard killings of one sort oc another as within his mission in
supporting one political faction over another. And of course someone
might have gotten carried away. It was clear from the Bay of Pigs that
the CIA sometimes acted without, or even against, instructions (e.g.
by bringing Batista followers into the Bay of Pigs invasion team). In
general, Latin American work seemed to attract the worst personnel in

all Washington agencies including the CIA.
