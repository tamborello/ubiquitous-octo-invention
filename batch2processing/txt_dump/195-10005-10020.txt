ACCOMPLISHMENT

Elements of the U.S. government were organized to reach the
goals set for Phase I. My assessment of where we are on each
objective is noted under appropriate sub-headings below. In general,

' this has been a remarkably quiet operation, well within the "noise"
and "visibility" mits imposed.

Higher authority has been kept informed of progress through
the Special Group (Augmented), by frequent reports. The Special
Group has provided policy guidance, as required, in-Phase I.

 

The Chief of Operations has coordinated the efforts of participa-
‘ting departments and agencies, through meetings of the Operational
. Representatives and by constant review of progress. The Ope rational.
Representative of each major U.S. participant in Operation Mongoose
are William Harvey (CIA), Robert Hurwitch (State), Brig. Gen. Benjamin
Harris (Defense), and Don Wilson (USIA).

 

My assessment of the organization, planning, and actions to
reach the goals in Phase I:

Intelligence. CIA had the main assignment to acquire the ;
“hard-intelligence" desired. The headquarters and field staff of CIA :
are now well organized for a major effort for this aspect of Operation pans
Mongoose, being strengthened by a number of CIA officers experienced.
in "denied area" operations elsewhere in the world. Planning and
actions rate superior, in a professional sense of intelligence collection.

[E] Florida, and an interrogation activity in Spain. | It undertook a priority COX)
