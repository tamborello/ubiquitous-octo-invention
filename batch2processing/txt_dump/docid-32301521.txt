NY 92-2300

A veview of the NY file of MICKEY DE MINO
(NY 92-2557) reflected no brother or relative who could be os
identified with any of the above-listed members. In addition,
NY 4609-PC advised that he is acquainted with underworld
figures who are active in the New Rochelle area and MICKEY
“the Leech" DE MINO is not known to him.

 

It is noted, however, that the agent to whom the
DE MINO case is assigned is presently on special assignment
in Jackson, Mississippi.

. The possibility still remains that NK 2461-C#, in
veferring to the"GAMINOS" meant "DE MINO", Additional.
investigation will be conducted in this matter and other
possible related associates in an attempt to resolve the true
identities of the "GAMINOS". =
