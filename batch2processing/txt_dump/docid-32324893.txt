Cit will be recalled that SA's WILLIAM G. FRIEDEMANN
and EDWIN L. SWEET interviewed JOHN MARTINO shortly after
his arrival in the U. S. He was’ endeavoring at that time
to surround himself with newspaper men, radio men, and some
individual who was. allegedly assisting him in writing a
book. It was noted that he had no specific information,
and his knowledge of Spanish is so meager that he could
not understand a simple Spanish conversation. He appeared
to be very publicity minded, and the Miami Office has had
no further direct contact with him’ #MUACB, he will not b{u)
interviewed concerning instant matter, since he was obvio
mistaken concerning the entrance into the U. 8S. of FUENTES.
