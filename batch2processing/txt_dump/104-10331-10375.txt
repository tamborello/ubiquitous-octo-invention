1. First part of meeting focused on action by the ARRB
at the 2/3 August meeting. Gunn emphasize that the feedback
he was giving me was unofficial and preliminary; that the
staff had not complete its review of board actions. Action
by the ARRB was taken on approximately 39 documents; a mix
of “release in fulls”, “release with redactions” and,

“tabled”. These actions included:

 

 

NVOY released when context did not indicate

activities (at least 8 documents); I was. given an
advance list. References to LIENVOY in (iaison} context and
the words and were postponed to the
year 2017. Gunn stressed that the ARRB discussed each
LIENVOY individually -- no blanket release or denial

 

 

[note: 7 of the 8 document were ones that HRG and DO
reviewers had concluded did not indicated

B. True names -- replaced with alias/pseudo when known
subject to re-review in December; one exception where the
name was illegible.

C. (GI-9) protected for 10 years; however would like
more information re ‘current risk. Gunn said the Board was
having a problem with GI-9)}due to amount of information in
public domain (Newman's book). They appeared to accept the
need not to release new information on(GI-9jor his
relationship with the CIA at this time, but there is a
debaté re postponing information that has been released in
other documents. Gunn suggested a statement from

D. They also ot LEAT 7) for additional information re
continuing to protect (LITAMIL-7)and
