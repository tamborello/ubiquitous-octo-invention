ask him to return the jewelry to his friend and DAVENPORT
was informed by DEQGUARDI that he did not have the jewelry
as he had sent it to New York City. Informant also advised
that he was told by DAVENPORT that he thereupon contacted
VINCENT JAMES PALMISANO, who was to have a meeting with
FRANK DIOGUARDI about this matter. DAVENPORT told the
Informant that whenever they get into any trouble among
each other, they are to contact PALMISANO to get the
difficulty straightened out.

According to MM 647-PC, the two thieves are
allegedly very close to DAVENPORT. The Informant also

Miami, advised him that DIOGUARDI contacted him and

staying at the Escape Motel, and HAROLD SOLOMON, brother-
in-law of JOSEPH INDELICATO, emptying cases of whiskey and
placing them on the shelves of the paekage store in DORE'S
Restaurant. Informant stated the empty cases were thrown
in the empty lot west of the car wash on Sunny Isles.
Boulevard, and they made several trips to get the cases of
whiskey in ANGELO'S Pizza Truck.

tables and chairs from this place after the .building was
taken over by the owner, LEO KUGLER. Informant stated that
