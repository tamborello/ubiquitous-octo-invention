he felt both men were "100%" behind AMLASIH. A/i went on to

leader, and could be regarded us "loyal" to AMLASH. However,
he did speculate that both men were perhaps closer friends

had been given several “encargos" from AMALSH Tor A/1 to be
“transmitted personally" (see attached copy of letter). Since

order to see the letter personally and to guide A/l in any
subsequent steps, The writer arrived at A/l'ts office at
ca 1240, 26 Feb,

b. Lt was A/I's impression that the "encargos"
cited in the letter included things beyond personal requests,
but he was not absolutely certain of this interpretation due
to the brevity of the paragraph. To resolve this expeditiously

talk directly with Hi order to clarify this, (A phone call
