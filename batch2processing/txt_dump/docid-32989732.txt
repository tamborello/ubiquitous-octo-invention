C The Honorable Griffin B. Bell

Department of Justice —
Washington, D. C.

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch ,
Deputy Assistant Attorney General
Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General: 8
yail

’ By a letter dated April 12, 1978, the Committee requested
that staff be provided access to the "informant files of all
informants within the Invaders during 1968 ...".

It is now requested that the Memphis Field Office files >
for these same informants be prepared for access by the staff.

; While the Committee feels that the procedure by which /f Gt
was permitted access to the first set of files was unacceptable’
and contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, pending future _.
discussions to arrange to broaden access, this procedure may’ —~
again be utilized.

t is my understanding that these files will be sanitized
only to the extent necessary to protect the identity of the
informants.

Again, the Committee reservabtthe right to request the
production of the identity of the informants involved if such
is deemed necessary to complete curainvestigation. _ xy

i, REI C2-17 212 ~ TOP

As time is extremely crucil in this matter, your protipt
attention in seeing that these files are prepared on a priority —
basis is greatly appreciated. a
