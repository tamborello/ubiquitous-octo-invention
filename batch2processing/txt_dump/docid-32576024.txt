unidentified man not to testify to knowing MAGADDINO, MAGADDINO

retorted that they only ask about him. because of JOHNNY POPS
(JOHN PAPALIA), and about another man whom BU T~2 believed to
be ALBERT AGUECI.

MAGADDINO then -began to discourse as to how this
unidentified man could testify by claiming inability to
_pemember and by claiming he had met many people. He also
suggested that the man could admit knowing MAGADDINO but
only casually and nothing of a derogatory nature,

,,. Later when MAGADDINO commented that he was proud
of the "family" he had raised, RANDACCIO asked MAGADDINO
in a facetious manner which "family" he was talking about. _
MAGADDINO expressed disapproval of RANDACCIO's comment,
whereupon RANDACCIO quickly added that MAGADDINO had done a
good job with "both families."
