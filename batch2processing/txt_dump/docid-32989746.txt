Subsequently, John Ray's parole had been revoked and John Ray was
jailed for approximately ninety (90) days, some of which was
spent in solitary confinement, due to the perjury charges by the
H.S.C.AL

At the hearing for John Ray, my name was not even mentioned, but yet
in F.B.I. files I was blamed for the perjury charge. Nothing of this
nature appears in my executive session testimony, of which, I have

Dear Mr. Moschella:
Ds
‘am writing on behalf of my constituent, Mr. Qliver
Patterson of 12350 Old Halls Ferry.,_Elonris t..Missounri
63033, who servéd as a witness before the Hdéuse Select,

Committee on Assassinations.

Mr. Patterson obtained copies of FBI files relating to

this matter and was concerned about a memorandum dated

August 3, 1978, which states that "their testimony

(Oliver Patterson's and Clarence Haynes') was responsible

for establishing the fact that John Ray, brother of James

Earl Ray, perjured himself in testifying before the same “y
committee." A copy of this memorandum is enclosed for Yip
your reference. i

In contacting the Committee in this regard, I was advised
that "Me. Patterson's testimony before the Committee was
not responsible for the recommendation by the Committee to
the Department of Justice that Mr. John Ray be investigated
for perjury before the Committee."

In view of the above, I would appreciate your review of this
matter and your comments concerning the memorandum which
cites Mr. Patterson's testimony as being responsible for the

perjury charge lodged er al HERE 2 are y OA / (72 ¥0- / 73 7x
