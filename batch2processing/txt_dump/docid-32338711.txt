he naia not think they were the right people." It will be noted here that
both VIOLA BROTHERS SHORE and SAMUEL ORNITZ have been prominent in the past
in connection with Communist front organizations, and further, it is re--
called that the pattern of BIBERMAN'S activities as cited in the writer's
reference report and the report dated October 4, 1941, calls for the use of
srsons 224 GY) been prominent in the past in Communist-dominated or-

pani gations )

The meeting at LESTER COLE'S house, above described, was dis-
ussed by MADELINE RUTHVEN. with BIBERMAN along lines which indicated that
ie was called because she had received a telegram from New ‘York asking for:

haste and presumably. sent by HARRIS" headquarters. Confidential National
Defense Informant Los Angeles No. 1100 advised that in the discussion
RUTHVEN stated that they must have the names in by the 24th, and the
informant suggests the possibility that the names in question are those of:
local spons ors and workers on the A.C.S.R. project. She stated that "they",
obviously meaning the New York headquarters, had "sent some names from

New York ~- some very good names." According to the cited informant, RUTH-
VEN further commented on the fact that it would be difficult to get’ JOLIE.

Informant 1100 has indicated that JULIE is identidal with TOHN GARFIELD

to attend the meeting because of his present. motion picture ESQ).

Reference is. made te the fact that HARRIS’ letter was addressed ,
to ERNEST DAWSON and further. reference is made tc the mention therein of:
VIOLA BROTHERS SHORE and JOHN GARFIELD. It is considered advisable’
to set out the available information in.the’ ‘files of the Los Angeles Field
Division Office reflecting the status of these individuals with relation to
the Communist Party. It: will be-noted that HARRIS himself says that he —
met DAWSON in the Soviet Union. The fact of DAWSON'S visit to Russia has
Been of record in the Los Angeles Field Division, which has a case entitled
"ERNEST DAWSON; MRS. SADIE ROBERTS DAWSON, with aliases; ESPIONAGE - R,"
Los Angeles File No. 65-1374, In this ease custodial detention memorandums
have been submitted on both DAWSON and his wife. The DAWSON'S live at
3003 Vineyard Street, Los Angeles, California, and DAWSON operates a high-
class book shop known! as DAWSON'’S BOOK STORE, located at 627 South Grand
Avenue, Los Angeles, California. .

N

DAWSON was a sponsor of the SCHNEIDERMAN-DARCY DEFENSE COMMITTEE, :

and his wifo was treasurer of that committee. DAWSON was also a captain of
the 6lst Assembly District of the AMERICAN PEACE CRUSADE and-has been re-
ported by ‘Confidential Netional Defense’ Informant Los Angeles No. 3 as a
member of the Communist Party as of January 31, 1939. This informant in-
dicates the present possession and ability to produce documentary evidence
of DAWSON'S membership in the Communist Party. In view of the fact that .
DAWSON appears cf. interest tc this investigation in the light of Rev.
HARRIS’ letter, it. is considered advisable to establish a-mail cover on
this individuel, ‘and same has been requested as of the date cf this report.

  

 
 

 

 

League, the school started as a school for writers on “Mondey, October 13,
1941, and from the circumstance cf the grcup meeting at LAWSON'S, it is ~

concluded that the meeting had reference to the launching of this school.
From Confidential National Defense Informant Los Angeles Nc. 3, there was
ebteined data ‘indicating that CEDRIC BELFRAGE, PAUL JARRICO, VIOLA

BROTHERS SHORE, and JOHN HOWARD LAWSON will be among the instructors in-
the school fer writers. Informant No. 3 advised that he had cbtained a
>rechure announcing the school and its courses, which indicated that
VIOLA BROTHERS SHORE would lecture on the composition of short stories, °
and that JOHN HOWARD LAWSON would conduct a course entitled "History of
American Liberty From the Colonial Period to The Present" on Monday even-
ings throughout the winter. ’ :

In view of the character of the lectures to be delivered by
LAWSON as indicated by the title of his course, consideration is being given
to the registration of a Bureau employee or Confidential Informant in a,
the courses being offered at the Writers* School. .

It is noted that the ‘LEAGUE OF AMERICAN WRITERS has received
attention as a Communist front crganization in the Los Angeles Field
Divisicn and full information concerning it is reflected in the case ;
entitled "LEAGUE OF AMERICAN WRITERS; INTERN AL SECURITY - Ry" Los Angeles
File Ne. 100-5377. : 4

As of the date cf the Gictation of this report, Confidential
National Defense Infcrmant.Los Angeles Nc. 1100 advised that informaticn
had been developed ecncerning General YAKHONTOFF, who, it is nected, is men-
‘ticned in the letter written by THOMAS L. HARRIS tc ERNEST DAWSON. The
cited infcrmant advised that one PHILIP GARDNER contacted subject BIBER-
MAN and advised him that the I.W.0. was bringing General YAKHONTOFF tc
Log Angeles cn the seventeenth of November, and that YAKHONTOFF would re-.
main until the twenty-third cf November. GARDNER stated that YAKHONTOFF
is"booked every night," but that he, GARDNER, got in tcuch with BIBERMAN
te cffer the services cf YAKHONTOFF tc BIBERMAN fcr propaganda use by sub-

_ject "ameng the Hollywecd crowd." BIBERMAN, in rejoinder, advised GARDNER

that possibly the AMERICAN COUNCIL ON SOVIET RELATIONS "might be able te
use him," but he stated that YAKHONTOFF would have to be made available in
‘the evening. GARDNER stated that possibly’ that could be arranged, and it

.was suggested that some time prior to YAKHONTOFF'S arrival,. BIBERMAN. get

in touch with GARDNER, whose office is Room 336, 257 South Spring Street,
Los Angeles, telephone MUtual 5468. Informant 4100 further stated that fol-
lowing the discussion concerning YAKHONTOFF'S availability to BIBERMAN if
the latter wanted him, GARDNER asked BIBERMAN if the latter would like to
be on a program with YAKHONTOFF at a mass meeting to’ be held at the Embassy
4uditorium, Los Angeles, during YAKHONTOFF'S visit. BIBERMAN immediately
stated to GARDNER that he expected. to be out-of ‘town in about three weeks
and would remain away from Los Angeles for at least six weeks,.and there-
fore, could not be publicly booked. It will be obvious from knowledge

of BIBERMAN'S intention to assume employment in a motion picture studio i

sega dated{october 13 and
L : :

7 : - - 15, 1941,
DETAILS: At the close of the last weekly period reflected in re- .

ference report; EDWARD C. CARTER was still at Los Angeles

and under observation intermittently by Special Agents STANLEY R. RUSSO ~ i

and the writer. , CARTER occupied room 6317 at the Hotel Biltmore, Los Angeles, { :
and was observed checking out of that hotel on October 12, 1941. A lengthy "
list of telephone numbers for calls made by CARTER during his stay at the j
Biltmore Hotel was furnished by Assistant Manager CATO of that hotel, and !
the identities of the subscribers thereto are being secured for inclusion

in a subsequent report. CARTER left no forwarding address and went per- :
sonally to the United Airlines Office immediately adjacent to the Bilt- -
more Hotel, where he made air travel reservations, From Mr. As C. VOORHIS;
Reservations Clerk of the said airline, the following prospective itiner-.
ary of CARTER was obtained; . . |

 

The records disciosed that CARTER was. scheduled to travel
on Flight 17 leaving San Francisco at 3:15 P.M. on October 14, 1941 for
Seattle, due to arrive in Seattle at 8:27 P.M. the same date. He was.
further booked to leave Seattle via United Airlines on Trip No, 14 for
Chicago at 4:15.P.M. on October 15, 1941, and scheduled to arrive at
Chicago at 8:32 A.M., October 16, 1941. Inasmuch as CARTER traveled
from New York to Los Angeles via this airline, it was assumed that he
would make further reservations on the same carrier at Chicago. 1 of
the offices on CARTER'S route were advised by reference tele Foe fet oct CO
13,.1941,] which further related CARTER'S status as an organizer for the
COMMITTER FOR MEDICAL AID TO RUSSIA. It was requested therein that the
PUPTTeaO2 127g d8, WERE OF, Paes SHE RRrinatekeaehe be Aavelopca eos
cerning his contacts, activities, and developments resultant therefrom
jn each of-the named cities. .

. Gonfidential National Defense Informant Los Angeles No.
1100 indicated that due to subject BIBERMAN'S illness, he did not ac~
company CARTER to the plane and did not see him personally after October
-9, 1941, JANE MEADE, however, according to the cited informant, took
up various matters with CARTER and relayed CARTER'S messages to BIBER~
MAN. It will be observed hereinafter that BIBERMAN was engaged. on October
y 10, 1941 on another of his projects and apparently did not have time to
entertain CARTER at his home. However, JANE MEADE indicated to BIBERMAN :
that the program of the Russian Aid Committee was thought by CARTER to :
be progressing satisfactorily and it is apparent that the group felt |
that, CARTER'S visit achieved the results of unity and cohesion in the
movement, the lack of which acoTi previously felt by them, as shown in

time a junior partner of MORGAN & COMPANY had been seen at a "red" meeting.

It is interesting to note the reference by BIBERMAN to the LAMONT spon~ ~
corse of Russian war relief in juxtaposition to his statements regarding

the AMERICAN COUNCIL ON SOVIET RELATIONS. It is reasonably obvious that there
is a motivating force controlling the resurgence of the two types of pro-
paganda favorable to the Soviet cause. and collaterally the education of _
the American public to the abandonment of prejudice against the Soviet and

(2 With reference to the conference arranged by CULLEN for HARRIS,
BIBERM id LAWSON as above cited, it may be stated that due to the

secrecy maintained by the parti cipants, no information could be secured

by Confidential National Defense Informant Los Angeles 1100.{ However, it

was ascertained that Rev. THOMAS ‘L. HARRIS was régistered at the Mayflower
Hotel, 527 South.Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California. His registration
ecard as furnished by Mr. McMEANS, manager , and photostatic copies of which
are being placed in the Los Angeles file inthis case, reflects that HARRIS,
accompanied by his wife, checked into the Hotel on October 3;'1941, and
occupied Room 925 until October 11, 1941. While at the hotel, HARRIS made
three telephone calls and sent two telegrams. On October 3 iui, he tele-
phoned Crestview 68340 twice, and it has been ascertained that the subscriber
to this number is the European Film Fund, 9172 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles,
California. Collateral. information. is being secured concerning this organi-
zation to ascertain, if possible, what business relations HARRIS had with the
organization. 4 ; coe

  
  

/

on October 10, i941, HARRIS telephoned Sunset 23387, which is

an unpublished number subscribed to by JOHN GARFIELD, 4031 Longridge Ave.,

Van Nuys, California. The status of GARFIELD will be described hereinafter.
The telegrams sent by HARRIS were both directed to New York City to addressees

whose identities have not yet been ascertained.

 

‘MW 54460

The Peoples World, Communist Party newspaper, in its
issue of October 10, 1941 carried. an article entitled "ANGELENOS URGE
MORE SOVIET aID" which reflected that HARRIS spoke at a rally under the’
auspices of the American Council on Soviet Relations on October 9, 1941.
