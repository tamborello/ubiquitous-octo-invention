-B, COVERAGE.

During the month of January 1963-LIFEAT provided unilateral coverage on a total
of 13 target lines, Coverage by target was as follows:

lL. Aleksandr G, SIDOROV
2, and 3, Polish Embassy
4, 5, and 6, Yugoslav Embassy

 

 

LL. Home of a Czech Intelligence Officer

 

 

 

 

13. “AWEITIWIALITZ
"PERSONNEL

David M. WILSTED returned from home leave on 1 February 1963 and assumed full |
responsibilities as LIFEAT outside Case Officer. Wayne C, DRABAND and
IEMBRACE- 8 who substituted for WILSTED in the LIFEAT operational and techni-
cal.phases respectively during WILSTED's absence are to be commended for their
ta intaining LIFEAT at the high level of efficiency and security normally enjoyed

by, the.operation. DRABAND's performance was the subject of separate correspon-
dence (see HMMT- 3469),

Ag presently projected, Wayne C, DRABAND will be leaving Mexico on or about 1
November 1963, The responsible Station Case Officer and WILSTED are atrempting
toiresolve the problem of a replacement for DRABAND at the local level, primarily
from the pool of agents already employed under the project. This would have the
advantage of not further disseminating the fact that LIFEAT does exist, but would
have the serious drawnack of giving knowledge of the whole operation (i.e. all
+ basehouses) to anot exican national, (Note: At present LIFEWUD~2 and
LIFEUD-3, the org ho now connect the tap lines ro the basehouses, are
the only Mexican nafi6iaIs Who know of the location of all LIFEAT basehouses, )

The Station does not desire another staff employee io fill this position, but would
prefer a.U.S, citizen, technically competent, with some working knowledge of Span-
h or ability to acquire a working knowledge of Spanish. Since working papers are
tremely difficult to obtain at present, for cover purposes anyone coming into
Mexico to. fill the LIFEAT position would probably have to come as.a retired person
‘with a guaranteed income, It is thought that perhaps an individual retiring from one
of the Armed Forces in a technical rating might have the best possibilities of filling
all the requirements noted,

ithough the ‘Station will continue to explore all possible solutions to the problem,
“itis requested that Headquarters’ views and, if possible, assistance be givea the
Station in this. matter,

. 2, ‘During the reporting period a number of memoranda were prepared by
“the Station for passing to local ODACLD and ODENVY based in whole or in part on
.LIFEAT provided material. The following HMMs were provided as a by-product
