Memorandum D. J. Clark to Mr. Bailey .
Re: House Select Committee on Assassinations

FBI Objection: The specificity of the information
tended to compromise FBI sources.

Published Language: Page 589, supra, now states
",..The FBI learned that the July 26 Movement was planning a
raid on Cuba from Texas. In connection with this raid,
armaments shipments were sent to McKeown. (1704)..."

Note: The substantive objection is removed by the
published language which sets forth the identital wording
recommended by the FBI.

RE ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. (MLK)

ITEM (1):

Original Language: "...the committee was able only ( :
to review the files of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)..." )
FBI Objection: Such language gives rise to the inference
that the HSCA may have obtained RCMP files directly from the i
FBI in violation of the rule prohibiting the disclosure of foreign |
agency information, absent specific foreign agency authorization. a

Published Language: "...the committee was able only to
review the files of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP),
which were attained by committee subpena from local authorities..."
(Report, page 328, paragraph 4)

Note: The objection is removed by the published
language. ~

ITEM (2):
Original Language: "...In a conversation with a female
acquaintance later reported to the FBI, Jerry's response to a

general question concerning his brother's involvement in the .
assasSination was:..."

Memorandum D. J. Clark to Mr. Bailey --
Re: House Select Committee on Assassinations

Published Language: Remains the same as above (Report,
page 441, paragraph 3). i

Note: Mr. Blakey declined to modify this statement of !
HSCA opinion when the issue was raised with him on 6/15/79. It
should also be noted that this objection cannot be construed as
a permissible objection under the MU. i

ITEM. (9):

Original Language: ''...Washington instructed the FBI
legal attache in Ottawa to conduct a similar review of Canadian
passports, with the assistance of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. (127)..." (QW

FBI Objection: Such language referred to the FBI's
relationship with a foreign intelligence service. Ch fa)

Published Language: "''...Washington requested Canadian |
authorities to review Canadian passports records. (127)..."
(Report, page 449, paragraph 1)

Note: The objection is removed by the published
language.

ITEM (10):

Original Language: '"'...In addition, the panel deter-
mined that the previously unidentified photograph 115, developed
from a coupon from Eric S. Galt to Modern Photo Bookstore, bears
an impression made by the left thumb of James Earl Ray..." ~

FBI Objection: The above language is incorrect since
the FBI originally identified photograph 115 as an impression
of Ray's left thumb and, therefore, the HSCA only confirmed this
identification. -

Published Version (MLK Appendix, Volume XIII): (1) On
page 116, under photograph 115, the Q number of 326 is added in
parenthesis following "Bookstore"; (2) on page 117, informa-
tion concerning the identification of photograph 115 is listed in
the correct order under paragraph 32; (3) the sentence in the last 1
paragraph on page 117, paragraph 33, beginning with "in addition," i
is deleted.
