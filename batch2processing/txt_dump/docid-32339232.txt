reiterated to GIBSON that he wanted to be sure he was
receiving mail distributed by the FPCC to the press,
He mentioned then that it appeared he was receiving
only general mailings, GIBSON merely replied, “oh,
that's the list that was given to (Senator) DODD,"

Also, on leks ai6h-gfaavtcoa that on GR
6/5/61 RE MARTINSONS (who employed in a cleric: a
eapacity at FPCC headq emarked that there are’
three FPCC mailing list MART INSONSBa1€ there 1s a )

' general mailing list, a press list, and a third list
" eoncerning whic TINSONSYBald, “We hav ecialf¥%\\W)
list for people a little revolutionary." )

On 5/23/61, CG 6259-S advised that. when RICHARD
GIBSON met- with the Executive Councilof the Chicago chapter .
of the FPCC on 5/20/61, at Chleago, Illinois, he remaried
that the National Office of the FPCC would soon send out
membership renewal notices on a quarterly basis,

 

 

 

 

 

It therefore appears quite likely that the FPCC
is coding its mailing list to indicate memberships, and
that GIBSON possibly perjured himself when he testified
before the Senate Internal Security Sub Committee, Never-
theless, it has been determined from above information that
BERTA GREEN has knowledge of the membership list. It is
possible GREEN. may be the custodian of the list.

: NYO is making arrangements to recontact NY 3045-5
“4n mid September, at which time attempts will be made to:
obtain complete current mailing list of the FPCC and examine
it for coded notations,

“Tn the meantime, all offices receiving a copy of
this communication should be alerted for any information
pertinent to the coding of FPCC mailing list to reflect

stuffed with propaganda, stamped, and were addressed

on the addressograph machine for mailing to individuais

in the NY area, Of these, approximately 400 envelopes :
were withheld from the mail by the FPCC due to a shortage |
‘in the number of one of the propaganda leaflets,

   

: ‘NY 3229S grasped the opportunity to confidentially
inquire of .BERTA GREEN, Secretary-Treasurer of NY, chapter ©
of the FPCC, as to the signifigance of tne code letters
"962", "B62", and "C62", which appear on approximately
1/3 of the addressograph plates. GREEN confided to
NY 3229-S that the FPCC has been gradually converting its
addressograph plates so that members on the mailing list
would be identified by code lettering which would signify
a@ quarter of the year in which the membership would come
up for renewal, GREEN explained that the code letters
"a62" on the addressograph plate identify a member whose |:
membership comes up for.renewal in the first quarter of 1962,
She said the code letters "B62" indicate a member whose
‘membership comes up for renewal in the second quarter of
1962, The code letters "c62" indicate a membership renewal |

“due in the third quarter of 1962, ;

This information is not being. disseminated outside ;
the Bureau at this time inasmuch as it has not been sufficiently
confirmed through other sources, Furthermore, other factors
set forth here and after appear contradictory, and yet
some of the factors set forth here and after-appear to
support -the information developed by NY 3229-S.. Moreove:,

NY 3229-S was unable to determine whether or not the
complete FPCC mailing list had been converted as yet or
whether’ just the NY mailing list was being handled ‘thus.

 

The Bureau will note that there are certain
establishments on this matling list which are also identified
with code letters, This may be the result of clerical
error at FPCC headquarters or on the other hand, FPCC.
may regard these as friendly establishments which they
consider eligible to receive all mail sent to members .
