Reference is made to the memorandum from Mr. Rosen to

Mr. Belmont, 11/20/62 (copy attached), referring to the article
‘of Rev. Martin Luther King, dxv.,, criticizing the work of the FBI
in relation to the Albany situation. The question has been raised
| as to whether we should not try to talk to King and set him straight
as to the Bureau's approach and activities.

- . ca
At the outset, it’ should be stated that it is questionable
| whether an interview with King will be fruitful. We have picked u2
information in the past that King admits to being a Marxist, but
cannot afford to admit this publicly. We know of his close tie-in
with Hunter Pitts Odell, a member of the National Committee of the
Communist Party, and we have seen various instances where King received
advice and his actions were apparently controlled,at least to some iA
extent, by the Communist Party.

 

J.

On the other hand, we do Know that King has been in touche
with the Attorney General from time to time, and in view of the
public image he has built up as a Negro leader he may fancy himself
-as a leader using the assistance of, but independent of, the Communist
Party.

- (1) Mx. DeLoach feels that it would be desirable to interview
. King. He recommends that he and Assistant Director Sullivan jointly
| interview King. He feels that two Bureau representatives should

| interview King in order that there will be a witness and there can
- |be no charge of provincialism inasmuch as DeLoach comes from the
South and ur. Sullivan comes from the North.

(2) Hr. Sullivan feels that King should be interviewed. He
feels, however, that if two Bureau representatives approach King, King
will be immediately on the defensive and no progress will be made.
‘He feels that King should be interviewed, initially, on a broad "beens

showing the Bureau's understanding of the racial and sociological
problems of the Negro, and thereafter the Bureau's position should
be built into this frame of reference. He believes that either
Hr. DéeLoach or himself should undertake the interview, individually.

   

(3) Mr, Sullivan suggests a third alternative. He is very \, 2)
well acquainted with Dr. Douglas Jackson, a well known sociologist (Whité
| and @ member of the faculty of Southern Methodist University in

Dallas. Dr. Jackson is iknown”°to Sullivan as a” man thoroughly and

soundly interested in solving the racial question in the South. He

is well known in different Negro areas for the stand that he Has taken

‘and he is respected by them. Additionally, Dr. Jackson has been quite
/interested in the work of..the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
_of which King is president.

Jackson has told Sullivan, as recently as a week and a half

ago in Indianapolis, that if he at any time can do anything which
{ would assist the FBI he should simply make the request of him. Sullivan
‘believes we should also give consideration to having Dr. Jackson

approach King and discuss this whole matter with him very thoroughly,

from a racial and sociological point of view, and ultimately clarify

in this discussion King's ideas on the FBI, and lay the groundwork

for King's support of the FBI. Sullivan would be perfectly willing

to brief Jackson on this entire matter and set the machinery in

motion, if it is do desired.

- RECOMMENDATION :
The above three courses of action are set forth ‘for the
‘Director' S consideration. I personally favor #2,

‘said that recently “their group 5 of wonlen correspondents met with Republican
Chairman Burch and with Democratic Chairman Bailey. Miss McClendon
inquired whether it might be possible for the Director to be host to their group

would like fo % arrange for ‘for her group to m meet the Director on some following
week for about an hour's quizzing,

of the Director's*commitments and the fact that it was extremely difficult for
him to set up arrangements for a briefing of this type in view of the emergency
