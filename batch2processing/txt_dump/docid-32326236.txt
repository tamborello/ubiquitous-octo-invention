something, so..source left. MATTHEW .and_went over -in..the. corner
and talked to MATULA. MATULA wanted to go outside; however,
-gource told him-he could: not “‘tnasmoh as he -was with MATTHEW.

MATULA told source that he had just arrived at
Lennie's Restaurant a few minutes before the meeting, after
a trip from San Francisco. MATULA pointed to his right breast
coat pocket and stated, "The bundle here is for the old
man." MATULA indicated he was going to deliver to HOFFA that
evening. Source estimates that MATULA had a million dollars
in cash in his pocket. When questioned as to how he arrived
at the million dollar figure, source stated that he has
carried as much as $500,000, and he knows how much money
you can carry, in your pocket. Source stated that the maney
was probably in $100 bills and he estimated that MATULA had
a bulge in his pocket of approximately six inches.

Source was asked why MATULA would_tell him that
he was carrying a "bundle" for HOFFA, and[___| stated that
when he was active in the Teamsters Union, he and MATULA
often competed for the favor of HOFFA and source believes
that MATULA was trying to "show off" to source. Source
stated that there is no question in his mind that MATULA
was carrying money to deliver to HOFFA and that the amount
being carried was around a million dollars. Source did not
actually see money.

Source did not know the significance of the unknown
woman being with MATULA. He noted that MATULA takes great
pride in traveling with extremely good-looking women and that
the woman who was with MATULA at the restaurant did not
meet the standards of MATULA's usual female companions.

As a-result, source concluded that the woman was somehow
involved in business being transacted by MATULA. Source
had never seen this woman before and had no idea who she
might be. He furnished the following physical description
of this unknown woman;

Race White
Age 28-32
Height 5'2-4"
Weight 100 lbs.
Hair Long, black, hung to the shoulders
