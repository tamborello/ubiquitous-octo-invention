Note: Alex-was barred by Swiss authorities in 1965 from ree
entering Switzerland for a period of 10 years due te his un-
Savory background and reputation as a hoodlum, He has continued
efforts through attorneys to have this ban lifted and within the
recent past,.letters were forwarded to Swiss authorities by
Congressman Dawson and Senator Dirksen, both of Illinois, in
Alex® behal®,.

Chicago has indicated efforts to 11i#4 the ban are
being continued by Alex and his attorney George Bieber, and
has suggested contact of Swiss officials by Legat regarding

q y in effect and representative of Swiss athorities, after checking

tinuance of ban, In view of controversial aspects of this situation,
and prominence of several individuals mentioned in connection
