Mr. Houston. Oh, no, there's a number of times. For

doing a good deal of political action abroad in the sense of -

However, this immediately got us into an internal security
and a police function. I told them they had to drop it, and

they did. And it's too bad, because nobody else has found a way

 

of doing it, and this information is floating over our heads
right now and we cannot use it.

Mr. Schwarz. Have there been any instances where you or
your office advised the Agency that it should not do something
when nevertheless the Agency went ahead and did it?

Mr. Houston. I should think I would remember an occasion
like that, but I don't.

Senator Mondale. Thank you.

(Senator Mondale left the hearing room.)

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Houston, with the Senator absent, you
don't have to go ahead.

Mr. Houston. Fine, fine.

Mr. Schwarz. I'm going to go on to another subject.

 

Does anyone else have anything else about the Robert Kennedy
meeting? vot vue

Mr. Kirbow. I have only one other question, and perhaps 7
more about the leadership of the Agency.

Mr. Houston, your reputation over the some twenty-six
twenty-eight years you were General Counsel was one of intense
loyalty to the Director and the Deputy Director of the Agency.

Mr. Houston. That is correct.
