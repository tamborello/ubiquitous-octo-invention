} United States concerning Cuha?

‘What. were you asked to do in December, 1961?

Mr. McManus. I was asked to make a survey of what was
going on in the intelligence collection field in Cuba, and I
spent the Christmas wesk in Miami where we had our Cuban
station, and I looked into all of our clandestine activities,
the number of reports we received, and how many agents were

dispatched, what was being done about the flow of refugees

from Havana to Miami. I wrote this report and submitted it to

the authorities when I returned.
As a result of this report, I had recommended a very

intensive affort in the interrogation of this flow of refugees

| becausu I felt there were a very qreat number of intellectuals,

' well-informed people who were coming in.

Mr. Schwarz. And somathing called the Mna-Lacka Center

; was ultimately set up?

Mr. McManus. Wall, this happened. Then I was told to
implement that, so I set up the thing called Opa-Lacka, yas,
the interrogation center.

Mr. Schwarz. All right.

Now, did you attend, in January, on January 19, a meeting
with a numbar of people, including the Attorney General “of the

Mr. McManus. Yes, I did. In his office, in the Attorney

Genaral's office.

Mr. Schwarz. Would you put in front of the witness, and
