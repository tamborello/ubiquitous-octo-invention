THEREAFTER ATTORNEY RONALD CHISHOLM, WHO IS KNOWN To BE THE
ATTORNEY FOR ANGIULO AT THE PRESENT TIME, CONTACTED THE INFORMANT.
CHISHOLM WANTED A COMPLETE RUNDOWN OF THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN AGENTS
AND INFORMANT AND EVENTUALLY SET UP A SCHEME WHERE THEY COULD DRAW
RICO IN TO SET HIM UP FOR EMBARRASSMENT, DISGRACE OR DISCREDIT.

IT IS KNOWN THAT CHISHOLM HAS BEEN APPOINTING ATTORNEYS FOR
DEFENDANTS IN THE CAPTIONED CASE. INTERVIEWING AGENTS ASKED INFORMANT
To EXPAND ON COMMENT “ANY OTHER WAY". HE STATED THAT HE BEING IN‘
PRISON COULD ONLY ASSIST THEM IN SETTING RICO UP FOR EMBARRASSMENT,
DISCREDIT AND DISGRACE AND HE WOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION TO KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT THEY MEANT BY “ANY OTHER WAY".
