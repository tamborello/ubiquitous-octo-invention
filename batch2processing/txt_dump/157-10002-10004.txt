J. D. (JAKE) ESTERLINE, who was head of the Cuba Task Force ~
in pre-BAY OF PIGS days, was regarded by the IG Report as :
probably the most reliable witness on general timing of :
these schemes because "he seems at least to have known of
all of them.'"' (9). .

The IG Report was: "unable to establish even a tentative
sequence among the schemes; they may, in fact, have been
ander consideration simultaneously." (9)
