RAMON DONESTEVEZ DOMINGUEZ

“Meanwhile, Cuban exiles in Puerto Rico announced
they have started organizing their own fleet to
join the Miami exiles,in the trip.

“Max orges, Jr., spokesman for the Puerto Rico
exiles, said the Cubans there plan to send 50 4
vessels to join Donestevez in Miami on Sept. 3. :
or 4.

  
  
   
   
    
    
  
  
   
    
  
 
 
 
   
    
  
  
 
 
 

"Yn a ‘Communique No. 2' issued Monday by
_Donestevez as president of the "Cuban Bloc for
the Liberation of Political Prisoners,’ the group
said it intends to deliver to the Cuban government
a.document ‘seeking amnesty' for the prisoners."

 

The above article also explained the attitude of the
U. S. Department of State toward the Donestevez plan and also
reviewed the Camarioca episode in October, 1965.

Mr. HENRY L, TAYLOR, mentioned above, advised that he
will do all that he can to dissuade DONESTEVEZ from going through
with his plan to léad a group of boats to Cuba for the purpose
of freeing political prisoners in Cuba,

On August 28, 1967, Ensign NED SPROW of U. S. Coast Guard
Intelligence Office, Miami, Florida, advised that the U. S.
Coast Guard will inspect all of the boats in the proposed flotilla
which will go to Cuba with DONESTEVEZ to determine if the boats
are in compliance with Coast Guard safety regulations.

On August 29, 1967, Agent HARRY SHERWOOD, U. s. Customs
Agency Service, Miami, Florida, advised that his office was
alert to the situation created by DONESTEVEZ and that his office
was actively working on the matter. He also advised that if a .
group of boats attempts to go to Cuba under the DONESTEVEZ plan,
the U. S. Customs will attempt to locate the boats and examine
them as to ownership and other regulations pertaining to boats
and their owners,
