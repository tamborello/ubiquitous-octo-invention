° EMERGENCY CONFERENCE
TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF THE
BLACK PANTHER PARTY TO EXIST

_ Sizable Gathering

The so-called. emergency conference to defend the
“rights” of the violence-prone, black extremist, and pro-
Marxist Black Panther Party (BPP) to exist was held in
Chicago, Illinois, on March 7 and 8. Because of the large
attendance--estimated at 1,000--the site of the conference
was changed from the Church of the Epiphany to the Malcolm X
University (formerly Richard T. Crane Jr. College), 2350 West
Van Buren Street. The credentials committee reported that
there were 540 registered delegates from 23 states and that

“128 organizations were represented.

Communist Sponsored

The Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), maintained a low
profile throughout this conference, but there can be no doubt
that the CPUSA was the guiding force behind the conference.
National Chairman Henry Winston and National Committee members
William L., Patterson, Charlene Mitchell, Claude Light topn
and Jack Kling were named official CPUSA delegates to

conference. The Illinois District of the CPUSA reportedly

provided funds for salaries of staff workers in the temporary
office established for the conference. In addition, CPUSA
functionaries in Boston, New York City, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis,
Denver, and other cities were in Chicago for the conference.

‘Welcoming Addresses

After the conference was opened by Father William
Hogan, Church of the Holy Angels, Chicago, Angie Dickerson
of the World Peace Council, New York, gave the welcoming
address. Dickerson was a member of the CPUSA in the 1940's
and 1950's. She was also Assistant National Executive
Secretary of the Civil Rights Congress, a communist front,
in the 1950's. She was in East Berlin last June to attend
the communist-sponsored World Assembly for Peace. Short
welcoming speeches were also given by BPP Chief of Staff
David Hilliard, BPP attorney Charles Garry, and Dr. Quentin
