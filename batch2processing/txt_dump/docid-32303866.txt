PH-591-C* was authorized 8/31/60, installed
10/26/60, and activated 10/27/60. , 4

At time of installation, facilities were
available for two separate microphones, insofar as bring-
ing the microphones into the central office were concerned.
Bureau has been advised in recent communications of the ©
anticipated increase in telephone facilities at the Maggio
Cheese Company, 1030 South-llth Street, Philadelphia. This
matter has been followed closely.

On 9/14/61, Philadelphia Division contacts at
Bell Telephone Company advised that the Maggio Cheese Com-
pany has requested an increased telephone facilities of
fifty per cent. This will necessitaté the installation of
an additional PBX and will place two telephones on’ each
desk. In this process, it has also been arranged that an
additional pair of wires running from the central office
can be obtained with the net: result being that two addi-
tional microphones can be installed at the present loca- :
tion of PH-591-C*,. This company operated by PETER, SALVATORE
and MARIO MAGGIO, each having separate offices. Present
coverage affords coverage only to PETER MAGGIO's office,

The increased coverage would afford coverage to all three of-
fices and should result in increased intelligence and general
info re captioned subject.

Technically, the installations will have to be in-
stalled using altered 4A blocks which will have to be
installed under pretext during the process of increasing the
Maggio Company's present facilities. This was the method
used in first installation and complete security can be ob-

os tained again in the present installation, It is thereby

! requested that the Bureau authorize this increased installa-

. , tion and that the Lab, Electronics Section, furnish the
Philadelphia Division two altered H4A blocks.

For Bureau info, it is noted that the telephone
company is beginning instant installation during the coming
week and Philadelphia, at this time, can furnish no specific
date that the opportunity will arise to increase activities
of PH-591-C*. Philadelphia Division, however, has to be in
the position to move when the opportunity presents itself,
and it is thereby requested that this matter be expedited
and that the altered 44A blocks, if Bureau permission is ob-
tained, be forwarded to reach the Philadelphia Division no
later than Wednesday, 9/20/61.
