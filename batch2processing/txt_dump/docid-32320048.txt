Title: SECURITY FOR THE JFK TASK FORCE'S
NEW LOCATION, ROOM 11144

Synopsis: The JFK Task Force (JFKTF) is relocating to room 11144
by mid July 1997. Due to the sensitive records maintained by the
JFKTF, a card key reader is being requested for access to room
11144. :

Details: The JFKTF is relocating to room 11144 by mid July 1997.
The nature of the JFKTF work requires maintenance of over 200
file cabinets of FBI records including Special File Room and
Personnel records. The JFKTF maintains a large volume of
classified records as well as its own sensitive indices for
research purposes.

Due to the JFKTF having a personnel count of 70°
employees and the impracticality of an employee watching the
entrance at all times, a card reader is being requested for the
entrance to room 11144.
