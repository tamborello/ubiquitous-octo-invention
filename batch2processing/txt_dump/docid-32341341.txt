7. Source added that they had also guest lecturers who were
officers from the Committee of State Security of Byelorussia who
came to the school ‘on infrequent basis to conduct seminars. ‘Once
in awhile guest lecturers from the Second [internal security and
counterintelligence] Chief Directorate [SCD] Center or the First
[foreign intelligence] Chief Directorate [FCD] in Moscow would
come to conduct a specific exercise.

c. One instructor discussed his involvement with Lee
HarveyGOSWALDzand how he ran OSWALD. [Debriefer's Comment:
Source was not sure if it was a true story or just some talk.]
This instructor alleged that Marina was a plant and that OSWALD
was an agent. Source opined that it was a piece of cake for the
KGB to run the OSWALD operation in the Soviet Union. Source is
also convinced that Marina had to be a plant of the KGB. The
operation was organized by the KGB and OSWALD fell in love with
her. The instructors also indicated in their lectures that the
KGB did not task OSWALD to kill the President. (NOTE: Believe
we should return to this topic again and discuss it with Source
in more detail.] Source questioned KGB'S rationale in running
OSWALD, an ex-marine with very little access to information.
Based on information available to Source at the school the KGB
did in fact run OSWALD.
