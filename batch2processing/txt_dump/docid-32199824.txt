Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
°62-116395

accepted in the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program,

.In view of the very recent (December, 1975) hospitalization
of Howe for purpose of curing his alcoholism, rest and
detoxification, it was believed, and Supervisor Daly
concurred, that we "touch base" with the SAC in Kansas City
to alert him of the SSC interest in interviewing Howe

and obtain from him his on-the-scene evaluation as to
whether or not SSC interview of Howe at this time might
have some adverse effects on Howe who, it is noted, is

on duty.

- On 2/3/76, Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the
Senstudy 75 Project telephonically brought the current
matter to the attention of SAC Bill Williams, Kansas City,
who advised that he anticipated no problem whatsoever
should the SSC interview Howe, Williams also wondered
why the SSC would choose Howe who, to the best information

-available, did not participate in the Kennedy assassi-

nation investigation, The only conjecture which

Williams had, and which Daly and Phillips likewise have, i
is that Howe's name may have come up in connection with

the SSC interest in SA James P. Hosty, Jr., who did

participate in the assassination investigation and who

has for some time also been assigned to Kansas City. ~

Williams said that he has talked with Howe on a number of i.

: occasions since the latter's release from the hospital
on 12/6/75 and it appears that Howe is making excellent

“progress and that an interview of him should not adversely
affect him, Williams will alert Howe to the SSC interest
to insure that, if Howe is contacted directly by the SSC,

- Howe will immediately advise Williams and in turn the
Bureau will be advised,
