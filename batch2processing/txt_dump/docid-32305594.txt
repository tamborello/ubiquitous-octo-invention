. . Persuant to this order the. San Diego informant
and FRATIANNO made a trip to Las Vegas, endeavoring to.
locate SEACH, to carry out this contract to kill but were
unable to locate SEACH, inasmuch as the Los Angeles Office
had placed SEACH at an address unknown to these two men,
in the Los Angeles area.

0n.7/10/68, SD 1064 advised that he had recently
contacted ROSELLI telephonically and asked ROSELLI if he
wanted the informant to make any further effort in regards
to killing GEORGE SEACH. ROSELLI told informant that it
was too late to do anything now and there will be time in
the future. Informant interpreted these remarks to mean
no action would be taken against SEACH at this time, but a
revenge murder would be arranged sometime in the future.

On 10/8/68, SD 1064 advised he had talked to
ROSELLI by phone on 8/5/68, at which time ROSELLI stated
after the Friars Club case is concluded, he intends to
go back to New York to explain to the LUCHESE family

. why they have been unsuccessful in getting the injunction lifted

on their investment in Panguingui card playing in Los

Angeles. ROSELLI said he was going to tell them that -
their suspicions of him using their $5,000 subsidy. “Ok
payment on his .own behalf are not true.

In this connection, SD 1064 advised in July
1968 that JOE LI MANDRI stated that attempts to reopen
card gambling casinos, dealing with Panguingui, in the
Los Angeles area have failed and’ he does not expect to
et the clubs reopened. Informant stated the New York
family",formerly headed by TOMMY LUCHESE, had invested
about $185 600 in Panguingui clubs in Los Angeles and
in addition to this, they have been paying a fee of
$5,000 to BEN TIETELBAUM (a gambler and a defendant in .
the Friars Club case) ‘in an attempt to get the injunction lifted.
The New York "family" now féels that TIETELBAUM has been :
doing nothing and spending this $5,000 monthly fee with
‘ROSELLI, NICK LICATA, "Boss" of the Los Angeles La Cosa
Nostra (LCN). family, stated he had questioned ROSELLI
about this and ROSELLI denied ever receiving any money
from TIETELBAUM. : : .

LA 4476-C-TE, an attorney in the Los Angeles
area, for the past several months has been in frequent
contact with JOHN ROSELLI. ROSELLI has mentioned to
this informant his need to make money and was willing
to do this on a partnership basis with the informant.

On one oceasion, ROSELLI was planning to invest
$25,000 in a business which serviced Cadillac automobiles.
At one time ‘he planned to employ..his nephew, PHILLIP Sacco,
in this'venture. To date this business’ has not materialized.

Another plan to make money was for ROSELLI and
informant to obtain the right to make teamster loans on
the West Coast. ROSELLI thereafter telephonically intro-
‘duced informant to Florida attorney, FRANK RAGANO, who
according to ROSELLI is an influential attorney close
to the teamsters and to other "friends of. his". RAGANO
expressed an interest in assisting ROSELLI in this venture.

ROSELLI made arrangements for informant to
fly to Miami during the weekend of 3/28-30/69, and
informant stayed at the Sheraton-Four Ambassadors Hotel,
where a reservation was made by RAGANO.

: Upon arrival in Miami, RAGANO introduced om
“informant to LCN "Boss" SANTO TRAPFICANTE and for the
next two days informant spent almost all of his time
in the company of REGANO and TRAFFICANTE. The main
topic of discussion during this period conc2rned
teamster loans and labor management negotiation, which
information and ROSELLI hoped to obtain on the West Coast:
RAGANO and TRAFFICANTE agreed to be partners with -
ROSELLI and informant in this venture. RAGANO was -to |
proceed to Lewisberg Prison and discuss this venture with
former teamster ‘union obss JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA. After
meeting with JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA, RAGANO was to fly to the .
West Coast to introduce teamster official FRANK MATULA fy
to ROSELLI and the informant and to make plans: for :
obatining teamster loans. .
