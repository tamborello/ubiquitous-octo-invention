Please refer to 3 your. 14451 dated 18th Deconber, in which you
- enquired if PARK had come to notice in British Yonduras.

 

2 Our representative in Jamaica has informed us that according \
_.. to his source in British Honduras PARK visited British Honduras five — NY
woe times during 1963. One visit, which has some significance, was from ... ., - “\

14th August until 11th November 1963. PARK returned to British Honduras = ‘|
- on 19th June and is, apparently, still there, examining prospects for N

‘sugar cane cultivation at Chunnox in Sorozal. |

. -gave the following information about himself. Hse owned a private "Howard"
. aeroplane which he piloted himself, based on McAllen, Texas.. The airoraft's
. registration number was N.9442 and PARK admitted that he had at one time used a a
. the aeroplane to smuggle textiles and whiskey into Mexico from the U.S.A. and @
’ British Honduras. Ha claimed, however, that he did not smuggle into tho TB hed
and Britieh Fonduras. Since 1962, however, because freight rates had fallen 6.4

a 3. PARK waa interviewed by the security authorities on 22nd June and A '

~ to fifteen cents per pound, he had given up all smuggling activitios.

he When he was questioned about RORKE and SULLIVAN, PARK admitted that
he did know something about them. He said that in late September or oarly
. October 1963 while he was in Texas he read an article in the American Argosy i
'. magazine calling for information about them. The article recalled to PARK a —
meeting he had had with tw Americans and a third man, described as of a
"Latin-type", at about 10.30 am. at Belize City airport on 25th September oO
1963. Hs identified the Americans ag RORKE and SULLIVAN from their description |
. in the article and photographs later distributed in leaflet form offering a A
reward for information leading to their present whereabouts. |

" 5. PARK recalled that when the Belize meeting took place he was waiting
.to pilot his ow aircraft to Chunnox. He noticed, standing at the terminal,

a two-engined "Beechcraft" aeroplane, painted blue, white and gold, Tho

--. “Beecheraft" struck him as an unusual aircraft to find in Belize, but although —
- he examined it, he could not recall its registration number or any other

identifying particulars, L 1F. Ze YbIZ2 23 = st

6, When he got back to the reception lous: at. the ain it, ASARTHD
Americans introduced themselves - presumably by near. tort LBBIAU G61 od Siear -

|» Tegucigalpa in the Republic of Fonduras. They did not volunteer their resson —
_.for the trip and PARK asked no questions. PARK left Belize before they did.

: 8 — Having remembered all this, PARK rang the editor of "Argosy" and as a :
result received calls from Mr. RORKE Senior and a man with the title "Captain" =
