Referenced letter requested advice of the FBI Laboratory
concerning use of a simplex circuit to enable operation of two
MITES on a selective basis over the same telephone line.

A simplex circuit can be used with a polar relay for the
control of two MITES. Circuit for this is the same as that
appearing as Figure 6, page 35, of the Handbook of Technical
Equipment, except that the transformers are omitted and the
circuit is established through one side of the line to ground. ~ -
. Experience has shown that the unbalanced condition created by
establishment of a control circuit in this manner may introduce
noise into the microphone line.

Switching of two MITES on one line can be more easily
accomplished by the use of diodes which are smaller than the
polar relay and much more easily concealed. There is attached
a diagram showing method of using diodes. It is recommended
that this circuit be utilized im preference te the simplex circuit
as it is simpler to install and will not introduce noise into the
microphone line.

JECT: "FOP HOODLUM PROGRAM JUNE
CHICAGO DIVISION
CG 6486-C*
At the present time Chicago is operating a MITE
approximately 14 miles distant from the Consolidated Plant.

Only one trunk line is available for this installation, but ,
it would be highly desirable to locate a second MITE in an
adjacent room and be able to select that MITE which is most
productive at the time. .

 
  
  
   
 
   

. It is pointed out that some line noise though not
objectionable is prevalent in the circuit due to the distance
involved and it would be highly undesirable to add to this
noise rati6..

. The Laboratory is requested to advise if a Simplex
circuit could be utilized to select one of two audio circuits
where MITEs are utilized. If so, how can damage to these
units be avoided? If a Simplex circuit’can be utilized in
the aforementioned installation, the Laboratory is requested
to furnish a detailed schematic outline along with any helpful
observations as it is pointed out the Chicago Division has
not utilized Simplex circuitry to date.
