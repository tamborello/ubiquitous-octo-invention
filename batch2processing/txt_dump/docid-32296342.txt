Re Bureau letter 1/8/63.

/ Reference is also made to Philadelphia letters to
the Bureau dated 12/5/61 and 4/3/62 captioned, "TOP ECHELON
CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM - PHILADELPHIA DIVISION," and
Philadelphia Airtel to the Bureau dated 12/20/62 of the same
caption, all setting forth information furnished by PH-599-PC.

It is pointed out that PH-599-PC has been reported
by numerous informants and sources to have been a member ‘of
"The Organization" for many years and to have been involved:
in Organization executions. It is recalled that this Infor-
mant was reported by some sources to’ be a member of the’
Organization during the "CAPGA" investigation, which took
place shortly after the mid-1940's. It is also pointed out
that this Informant was reported to have beén involved as
one of the killers in an Organization execution which took
place during late 1940, It is not knowm if he was a member
at that time; however, it.is quite possible that if he was -
not a member, he was admitted possibly following this parti-
cular execution. The Informant (as with other members of ~
the Organization) considers "respect" to be highly signifi-
cant and desirable and definitely considers himself to be’
above the average criminal, although he freely admits that
he has been involved in eriminal activities throughout his
adult life.

The contacting Agent has’ been acquainted with the
Informant since approximately 1950, when he was first con-
tacted in connection with the "TENUCA" investigation. He
apparently has some personal respect for the contacting Agent,

y (EF 786s

having made that evident during the contacts by his convérsa- ‘

tion and, also, by the amount of information that he has el

furnished to date. It is pointed out, however, that although
each contact appears to improve his relationship with the ~
Agent and his inclination to talk more freely, nevertheless,
the interviews continue to be very carefully planned in order

It is considered vitally important to the ultimate develop- :
ment of this Informant to, at the present time, avoid asking
direct questions that would make it inescapable that he is
considered as an informant.

It is also pointed out that security of contact
with this individual must be considered most seriously. He
is incarcerated and it is not considered desirable to con- -
tact him any more frequently than every three months. Even
these contacts should be on more or less irregular intervals.
In an effort to avoid pinpointing the Informant during visits
to the prison, other hardened convicts who have been known to - ‘
the Agent for a number of years are contacted and maintained :
in general conversation, in order that they will discuss this
fact with other inmates and reduce the significance of the
contacts. It is important to impress upon the Informant that 4
consideration is given to his security, particularly since ~
associates in the Organization are exerting considerable poli-
tical pressure to causé him to be released on parole in the
near future. If he feels the contacting Agent is careless in
this regard, he may well refuse to make meetings after he is
released from prison.

In view of the above, it is not considered desirable
to recontact PH-599-PC at the present time, particularly when
it is considered that he was contacted on December 18, 1962,
as reflected by information in the last-mentioned reference
above. If still desired by the Bureau, efforts will be made
to set up an appropriate interview in approximately one month
and efforts will be made by steering the conversation to de-
velop as much of the information as possible with regard to
the request in Bureau letter 1/8/63. It is noted that some~
information concerning present and past restrictions on mem-
bers joining the Organization is set forth in Philadelphia
Airtel dated 12/20/62 captioned "TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL
TNE ORMANT PROGRAM - PHILADELPHIA DIVISION," Bureau File 137-
7265.
