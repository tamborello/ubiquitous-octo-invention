Rebuairtel 5/6/64.
The information reported in CHARLES MC HARRY's colum
5 of 5/6/64, was initially reported by NY 3461-C-TE and has since
: been confirmed by other reliable Boston and New York sources.
: Since COLOMBO's installation, the fact that he has assumed command
i of the PROFACI-MAGLIOCCO "family" has become fairly common knowledge
. in Brooklyn and New York underworld circles. Hoodlum LARRY GALLO
; has semi-publicly spoken of COLUMBO's. assumption of power as
7 indicative of his own resumption of stature.

It is believed that COLUMBO's current role is now
widely known in NYCPD circles.

MC HARRY is a Broadway columnist of considerable
stature with numerous underworld and police contacts. It is
believed doubtful that he would reveal his source, if contacted
directly.
