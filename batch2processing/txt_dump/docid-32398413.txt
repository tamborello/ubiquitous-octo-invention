Adding more information to what Mario gave in his Memo to A. Friday

25th, and correcting certain things of which Mario was not fully aware,

{i wish to say the followings 5

Individual 1: I met him for the first time 5 or 6 years ago, when
I needed some lock work to be done in my Jewelry Store,
I called the M. Le Key Shop over the telephone, and he was the individual
who was sent over.to do the work. In several other opportunities that 1
have needed lock work, I have called the same place over the telephone
and he has always been the individual sent over to do the work, Right .
‘after we moved the office to the new location I called the key shop again
to have two locks installed, and he was again sent over to install them. »
At that time I did not see him because when he came to do the work Gladys |
_- was the only one in the office and she received him. The last time I saw
- him was about three years ago when he did the last work in my jewelry store.
I am pretty confident that he is not aware of my present connections and
he surely believes that I am hundred per cent involved in the jewelry busi~
NesSSo It is also my belief that prior to the recent operation he was
neither connected with the same people we have beens : :

 

- Individual 22. This individual was my first "contact" in 1960, introduced. :--
to me by Bender in New York. He was at’ that time in charge
of what we used to call the."civilian part" of the operation. He left after’:

the failure of the invasion, and gave,me a Post Office Box number in Washing= .-

ton, which I.don't remember now. . I wrote to him two or three friendly lec= :
‘ters. The. last time the letter was returned by the Post Office (I think the
Box did not belong to him anymore), The last.time I sew him was July 5, 1961,
at the Hilton Hotel in Washington, when I was called to inform about how the
“rate of Payments to the dependents of | the brigaders had been established,

 

Individual 32) I never ‘met this individual,

Individual 4: I met this individual at La Moderne Hotel in Miami around -
May or June 1960, being present in that meeting the members
of the Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front (Turned into C.R Co. afterwards). -

After that meeting I saw him in two or three opportunities, but accidentally.
When Joe Birley took charge as my “contact", this individual started to act
as interpreter between Joe and I, but I was not pleased with the way he con=
ducted himself as an interpreter and I asked Joe to substitute him, Mario
‘started to act as interpreter ever since. The last time i saw him was in
the last meeting he acted as interpreter between Joe and I, _

Individual 5: This individual was a classmate of mine in the Havana High ~
School around 1939, with whom I had nothing more than an
acquaintance rather than a friendship, JI-have had no contact with him wnat-

taurant in Miami, 'in which opportunity I just saw him but did not even say ~
hello to him or: spoke with hin, : oo

AS

 

I have never met or seen this individual,

JUAN

 

 

This individual was the interpreter between Bender and the members of C.D.R.Y.- *
