The métxiemer contents of this communication are

This matter was predicated upon receipt of information
from T-1 that ALFREDO MIRABAL-ALVAREZ had arrived in Miami,
Florida approximately in June, 1988. He was sponsored by his
mother in entering the United States and resided with her for a
short period of time. MIRABAL-ALVAREZ departed Cuba in 1987 for
Spain where he established residency until entering the United
States. While residing iff Spain, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ became involved

litically with HUBER his organization, ARMANDO
a VALLADARES and MANUEL SANCHEZ REZ (Cuban official who defected

     
 
   
  
 

et

 

Sy ‘to Spain in 1985). M VAREZ‘S father (now deceased)

ot \2) served as a Vice MiniSter in’the Ministry of Interior until the
"microfaccion" (period of purge of numerous officials in the late
1960’s). According to T-1, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ was apolitical while
residing in Cuba. MIRABAL-ALVAREZ’S Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) file reflects he exited Cuba for
Spain in approximately February, 1987, until entering the United
States on June 3, 1988 as a result of being petitioned by his
mother, who was granted United States citizenship in 1976. In
Cuba, MIRABAL-~ALVAREZ’S occupation was an electronic technician
and it appears he applied to leave Cuba in 1967 and was denied
exit by the Government of Cuba because of pending military ey Gayl

On September 11, 1990, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ was interviewed
at the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
MIRABAL-ALVAREZ advised he arrived in the United States on June
3, 1988 through New York. MIRABAL-ALVAREZ left Cuba on February
14, 1987 for Spain, where he remained until his arrival to the
United States. MIRABAL-ALVAREZ advised that in 1980 his wife and
children were allowed to leave Cuba for Spain, but he was not

allowed to leave because he was an engineer. Prior to his
‘ attempt to leave Cuba, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ had just concluded a trip
to East Germany for approximately 20 days in November, 1979. In

 

 

approximately March, 1980, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ asked to leave Cuba
