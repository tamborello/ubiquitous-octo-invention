Doar Mr. Diaz:

This will confirm our previous discussions .
wherein .e agreed to employ you at the rate of
per month to commence March Ist. AS sis explained to you
at our last meeting we are cagaced in a study te determiae
the effect of large scale migration on given communities
and the dislocations that result therefron.

 

we feel that the Miani area is unique in that the dis-
locations caused by the influs of so many of your fellow
countrymen furnashes an excellent opportunity to conduct this

study.
It is anticipated that you will spend a large portion of

your time in our New York offices, however; 1t 11 also
recuire a substantial amount of travel on your part.

if you are still in ugreewent with this proposal please
advise me as soon as possible. I sould Like to begin this atudy
