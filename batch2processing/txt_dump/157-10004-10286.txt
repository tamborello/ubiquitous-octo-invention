the implications of the two § Jtelephone conversations

ES ACONVERSATION OF CUBAN EMBASSY EMPLOYEE;

.% .
18. At 1730 Mexico City time, about five hours after the

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named
» "Luisa" received a ‘télephone call in Spanish from an uniden-
tified male outside. .
19. The caller asked her if she had heard the latest
-news. "Luisa" jokingly replied: "Yes, of course, I knew
it almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and
now, that makes three [she laughs], what barbarians! eee”

20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the

 

assassination. "Luisa" also stated that the party at

Silvia DURAN's had been called off so it would not appear
that they were celebrating the death of KENNEDY, nor would
they have the party coincide with the burial. Finally she
said she planned to move that night into the house of a ,.

doctor (a woman) friend. ’

ee . 23. There is no evidence in the OSWALD case file that
Silvia DURAN was subjected to a systematic elicitative

interrogation that would have related her dealings with

 

OSWALD, known or confirmed fs ae with the data held -
on the Cuban DGI, its personalities and methods, in
Mexico City. Was it normal for a case like OSWALD's,
considering the fugs, he allegedly made with AZCUE, for the
applications to be handled solely by a local employee and
a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken by the
DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they >
were not asked at the time. And there remains. the more

fundamental question: accepting the DURAN story on its

face, could it have happened without the knowledge and

 

participation of the DGI personnel above cited? This
seems unlikely especially because VEGA is later cited by
a Cuban DGI defector as having stated he was aware OSWALD
made several visits to the Cuban Consulate. It is clear

Fair Play Committee for Cuba, with which OSWALD established
relations from Dallas during the period 19 April -

2 November 1963. There is an overlap between LEE's and
VEGA's travels to Havana during that period: VEGA

departed Mexico City on 6 January for Havana and returned
on 13 February 1963. .,
