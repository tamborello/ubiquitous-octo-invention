On November 17, 1960, U.S. Customs Agent VAN DIVER
advised SAs KELLOGG and EDMISTON that onthe previous night
GARCIA}had advised an informant, described by VAN DIVER as
reliable, that he had been. offered $50,000. to deliver

D'ALESSANDRO to the DR. ‘GARCIA reportedly said this offer,, pea '

was made to him by JOHN

ho Vv. VER, thought was ~
probably identical with], A

   
 

Dominican Intelligence ] AN ‘DIVER \said he had heard from
other sources that GARCIA had\mentiloned a $100,000. deal

and a $50,000. deal, and had notes in his room pertaining. .
to such deals, but VAN DIVER could not be certain that this <
information pertained to the above matter. He said his in-'
vestigation indicated the DR had lost confidence in GARCIA
and was attemt ing to get him out of the proposed invasion.
Propos ition ®

On December 5, 1960, PIATKOWSKI said-he had seen.
GARCIA that afternoon and GARCIA said he was leaving within |
an hour for Tampa, Florida, to pick up some "stuff" and

' then proceed to New York City. PIATKOWSKI said GARCIA stated,

"It's all set. IL am kidmaping D'ALESSANDRO." PIA’ SKI

' said|he mentioned to GARCIA he had not seen/FONDEUR}Fécently,

and GARCIA answered, "To hell with{ FONDEUR have made
different arrangements." “PIATKOWSKT sai CIA then asked
him for the "contact number" in New York City, stating he
had lost his, and apparently believing PIATKOWSKI had know-
ledge of such a number, but he did not. PIATKOWSKI told
GARGIA. he would attempt to get that number from MALDONADO.

Later that same evening, PIATKOWSKI advised he had
‘again seen GARCIA in Miami, and GARCIA indicated he was leaving.
for New York City that night.

VAN DIVER said from past experience he surmised.

that the boats GARCIA was supposed to be able to. furnish —
.were -boats owned by EDWARD BROWDER, and the arms. might
come from BROWDER or DOMINICK BARTONE, both of whom had
dealt in such things in the past. He said, in fact, ©

‘the above informmthad advised that fol lowing his return
to the United States, GARCIA was in contact with BROWDER,
who was to furnish two 110-foot boats for the invasion
-force, along with arms, and subject was also in contact
with BARTONE, who was furnishing funds to GARCIA.

associate of former Cuban President CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS — , :
and has been arrested in the past by U.S. Customs in a. |
matter.pertaining to an invasion of Cuba aimed at the

overthrow of the then Cuban President, FULGENCIO BATISTA.

mames MAX GARCIA and MAXIMILLIANO GARCIA. PIATKOWSKI
said GARCIA advised he had heard nothing more about’ the
D'ALESSANDRO matter, but would telephone the DR about _
it. He also advised at. that time, without being more
specific, that he had $600, 000. worth of guns and
recoilless rifles.

‘seen GARCIA that day, and GARCIA said he had. contacted »

told them he wanted $5,000. expense money before starting \
' ‘anything. He said .GARCIA: furnished his telephone number
_in Tampa, Florida, as 82-8661. . PIATKOWSKI said GARCIA ‘also »

~ PIATKOWSKI said this group were reportedly members of an
'  erganization led by (FNU) D'ALESSANDRO, a Dominican exile from
the New York City area who 1s. opposed to the government. of
GENERALISSIMO RAFAEL L. TRUJILLO, DR. According to
PIATKOWSKI, REINARTS also indicated another group of Domini-
can éxiles from New York City would soon be leaving on
another "sell-out deal" to the DR.

any group has departed the United States to invade the DR.
