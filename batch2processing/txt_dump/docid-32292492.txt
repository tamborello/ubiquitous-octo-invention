ANTIRACKETEERING

Re Bonn airtel 12/1/64.

Under date of December 22, 1964, the Bundeskriminalamt
(BKA - West German Federal Criminal Police) advised that
SUZANNE FUEGER, accompanied by her mother, left Munich,
Germany, by Lufthansa Airlines at 12:50 P,M.. December 19,
1964, en route to Zurich, Switzerland.

 

It will be recalled that .FUEGER and her mother
traveled from Munich to the mother's home in the very small
village of Riederau on the Ammersee (a lake) south of Munich
on 11/25/64, after having made hotel reservations in Munich
for the nights of December 17 and 18, 1964. The BKA stated
that a surveillance of FUEGER and her mother on December 18
and 19 failed to reveal any significant information and they
appeared to Spend their time in Munich, Germany, in shopping.

 

Since “EUEGER has departed from Germany and no
specific information has been received regarding any plans
of the subject to enter this area, active inquiry here is
in abeyance but this case is being kept in a pending-inactive
status as further inquiry will probably be necessary before
the subject and FUEGER return to the United States.
