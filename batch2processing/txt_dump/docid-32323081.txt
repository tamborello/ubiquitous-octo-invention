; Informant determined that a Dali las CP meeting took place
ep 11/14/66 at 2230 Roanoke, Dallas. Present were JOE and HARGARE?
LANDIN, BILL LOWERY and AUGUSTIN ESTRADA.

BILL LOWERY reported the people in Ft. Worth, whom he. had
seen recently, had not wanted to register. and all but one had refused
té vegister. HAROLD MANN said be would not join until it was sate
to be a Communist publicly... BETTY MANN gave her reasons for not
registering ~ she was disappointed and confused in what had taken
place in Russia after STALIN's death. COLUMBUS and BARLENE MARTIN
had tefused to register because the  — Ft, Worth club was unknown,

it had no connections with either the state or national office.-

McKINNEY FRETWELL was the only one wanting to re-register. . BIL,
LOWERY would not sign him up asia Ft. Worth momber but offered to
place him with the Dallas group. FRETWELL refused the offer. .  . -
McKINNEY FRETWELL'’s re-registering was left pending, -FRETWELL has
a friend whose name, BILL LOWERY believes, is JOHN BARKER. BARKER |
would net join either = joining the CP, he said, required a great
deal of thinking.

Informant determined it. was agreed that a report be made

at the next State Committee meeting regarding the status of the

Ft. Worth group. They decided that instead of breaking relations
with the Ft. Worth group, a friendly relationship should be main-
tained .. The group over there could be ef some help to the Dallas
cP, . sO
