15 MAR O71
MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT : Status of AMCALL-1 Ransom Negotiation {7

1. On 26 August 1970, $120,000 ransom was
paid for the release of AMCALL-1. $70,000 of this
amount wds paid by the Agency and AMCALL-1l's wife i
arranged to obtain the remaining $50,000 from $
August Vanistendael, a prominent Belgian with high |
level Vatican connections interested in AMCALL-1 :
who presumably provided the additional money. Al- |
though there was no firm commitment as to the exact a
time AMCALL-1's release would be effected, AMECRU-1
anticipated his release within 60-90 days after
payment of the ransom.

2, Although 6 months have now elapsed since
AHECRU~1 delivered the money to the Cuban negotiator
in Paris, there was no way to determine the reason
for the delay in AMCALL~1's release until AMECRU-1
was able to return to Paris to discuss the matter
with the GOC representative authorized to negotiate
the ransom cases. Since AMECRU-1 now resides in
Miami he is no longer able to maintain as close
contact with the Paris official as was the case when
he lived in Barcelona. However, he did arrange a
trip to Paris in January to discuss the status of

1 and other ransom candidates with the GOC

representati e the talks were still in
progress, tne Tease officer in contact with
AMECRU-1I met w ™ in Paris on 28 January. Since

reel aap Station has consistently been advised to
avoid any indication of CIA interest in any ransom

Although a full report on the results of his Paris |

to Miami, AMECRU-1 has n touch with AMCALL-~1'g
wife and QUPILL-1 ti thesee handling the
AMSOUR-1 case. Acco: ANCALL-1's wife, AMECRU-1
advised her the GOC representative in Paris indicated
the delay in releasing AMCALL-1 was Partially based’
on the fear expressed by certain GOC officials of
ANCALL-1's potential leadership in exile movements

if he is freed. As a rebuttal to this Goc argument
AMECRU~1 wrote a letter to Manuel Pineiro, the DGI
Director in Cuba, Stating that AMCALL-1 had no desire
or intention of engaging in political activities
after his release and wished to seek employment with

in resettling AMCALL-1 in Europe, was attached to
AHECRU-1 letter to Pineiro. The case officer
obtained copies of the AMECRU-1 letters to Pineiro
from QUPILL-1 and forwarded them to Headquarters.

3. AMECRU-1 also told AMCALL-1's wife that
the GOC Paris representatives offered to return
the ransom money if the interested parties were
not satisfied with the current progress of the
case, The ramifications involving any demand for
return of AMCALL-1's ransom and termination of any
further efforts to obtain his release are considerably
greater than was the case with AMPANIC-7 whose entire
ransom was provided by the Agency. In the case of
AMCALL-1, there would be no way to demand return of
our share of the ransom without exposing Agency
interest until such time as the Catholic contributors
indicate a desire to recover their $50,000 investment.
Not only did Vanistendael's letter fail to indicate
any concern in this respect, but clearly emphasized ..
his continuing deep interest in obtaining ANCALL~1's
freedom. AMCALL-1's wife is also insistent that his
chance of being released not be endangered during
this precarious stage of the negotiation and that
any decision concerning return of the ransom be
determined by AMECRU-1's evaluation of GOC intent.
Although ANCALL-1's wife has always been discreet
and her relationship with the Agency cooperative and
above reproach, her understandable anxiety over her
husband could lead to extreme resentment should any
attempt be made to recover the Agency's share of

the ransom at this juncture. This would be particularly

true if the Catholic contributors show no alarm over
their investment or the present lack of progress made
in effecting AMCALL-1's release.
