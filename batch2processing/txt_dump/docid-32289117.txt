a) The Explosive Charge - Rectangular in
shape with the following approximate dimensions: 30 x 20
x 7 centimeters. The charge consists of a block of
explosive covered with a solid, putty-like plastic
material, the entire surface of which is covered with
black insulation tape. At one of its edges, 2 plugs
for an iron pipe of 3/4 inch diameter were found. These
are fastened separately by a screw to lengths of galvanized
iron pipe of the same diameter and approximately 15
centimeters long. The pipes are located inside the
explosive charge and serve as a lodging for the detonators.
Two metallic rods of 7 millimeters in diameter and 10
centimeters long extend along the longitudinal axis of
the charge. They have screws at the ends which serve

_ to fasten them to the spools.(/$)

The explosive inside is white in color and
plastic-like. Its characteristics and potency are unknown
It will be necessary to conduct analyses to determine
its class and type.(S) @

It was ascertained that the explosive charge
( was not assembled and ready for detonation, since it did
not contain the proper elements for starting, propagating |
ow and amplifying the detonation. PHs7s6enpH Wo. 13(8) :

 

b) Spools-magnets - There are four of them,
and they consist of spools of approximately 3 x 2x1
inches, containing at their ends two metallic plates
fastened by bolts. Each of these plates has a bore hole .
into which the small rods used to hold the charge are
placed. On the side opposite that containing the bore
hole, there is a metallic plate whose function is to
serve as the surface which is connected by the magnet
to any metallic surface. Photograph No. 11 (5)

Detonators - The detonators are of the
percussion type and apparently are activated by an
electric current. They have an approximate lensth("s }

Because of the condition in which they were
found and because they were found to be safe for handling
and transportation, they were not destroyed. ($)

V. Transportation of the Explosives and Their

Delivery to the D.F.S.(S) 5
The explosives (complete charge and recovered

remnants), detonators and magnets, perfectly wrapped

and packed, were brought to this city on the afternoon

of the 4th and were handed over to the Federd Security

Police on the morning of May 5, 1967. Later, at

' 11:30 A.M. on the same day, they were sent to a powder

i magazine at the explosives plant, after having first

| been examined by the Director of the D.F.S. . The explosives

are now at the disposal of the proper authorities (5)

Government, through the (Mexican) Federal Security
Police (D.F.S.), requested the cooperation of the technical
personnel of this Department in the finding, identifying
and destruction of some "bombs," detonators and other

D.F.S., had been brought into the country and buried at E
a spot near the Mante-C. Victoria road, between kilometers
643 and 644.(5)

Explosives Were Found. S$) ‘

As a result of the above request, the under-

the D.F.S., went immediately to Ciudad Mante, Tamaulipas,
and arrived at said plaza at 3:20 A.M., May 8, 1967s) g

On the same day, at 8:00 A.M., we went to the
indicated spot, between kilometers 643 and 644, for the

kilometers 642 and 643. The location is shown on
Photographs No. 1 and 2.05)
