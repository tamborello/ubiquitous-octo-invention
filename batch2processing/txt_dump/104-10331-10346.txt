VL. The Need Ror Additional Time

Despite our best efforts and significant accomplishments, some of which Ihave
Outlined, the Review Board will not be able to complete its work within the original
theee-yenr timetable set by Cangrens ine the following reasons:

* First, the authors of fe uriginal leyislation belleved that our task would tuke
three years. That estimate was based.on the best available information at the.
time, but the legislation established an unprecedented process. There wes no
way of knawing the problems of scale and complexity that the Board would,
encounter, nor was there any way to factor in the comprehensive approach we
have taken in fulfilling our mandate. ‘

« Second, the Board was not appointed until 18 menths after the legidlation was
signed inlo law, Ap.a result, without the guidance of the Board, Federal agencies
defined for themselves the universe of records that should be processed
under The Act and to speculate about the kind of evidence Gut would be needed
te sustain the redaction of assassinationyrelated information. Once the Board
