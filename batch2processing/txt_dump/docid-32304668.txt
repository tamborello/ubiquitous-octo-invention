called to the Ritz Bar operated by MOLLICA by MIKE ROMEO. ROMEO

and to tell him that all had been cleared up. cv 344-c stated
PANDELLI. advised: he did not go to MILANO with this méssage, but
saw his subordinate, DE AUGUSTINI, at Cleveland who said he would

He gave the following example:

He stated about 1958, a Warren, Ohio, pimp named: BENJAMIN
PANDELLI, not considered a member of the"organization" because
of his means of livelihood which is frowned upon by the "organization",
backed a sheriff in his candidacy for the office at Mansfield, Ohio.
AS a result of this back, he was allowed by the successful
candidate to open a house of prostitution in Mansfield, Ohio. The ~—
sheriff was not backed by TONY MOLLICA, a member of the "organization"
at Mansfield, Ohio.

CV 344-C stated when MOLLICA noted: that PANDELLI's
operation, was a money maker, hé approached PANDELLI and told him

that people in town were talking and Saying that he, MOLLICA, was

responsible for the house being able to operate. He sata it

was giving him a bad namé. cv 344-c advised PANDELLI realized that
MOLLICA was not concerned about his bad name and that MOLLICA was
attempting to move in and muscle him. When PANDELLI was not
receptive to the attempts of MOLLICA, MOLLICA then sought the aid™
of MIKE ROMEO, Poland, Ohio, who approached PANDELLI with the same
Story. ROMEO told PANDELLI, according to CV 344-c, that he should
close down for a couple of months so that things could be "cleared
up." ROMEO told PANDELLI that he was a friend of his father, ;
GUISSIPPI PINDILLI. ‘PANDELLI refused to close and CV 344-c¢ advised’
according to what PANDELLI later told him, he. wrote a letter explain-
ing the situation to his father in Buenos Aires.; CV 344-c stated
PANDELLI then received a letter from his father which instructed
him to take this letter to ANTHONY MILANO, in Cleveland,” which
apparently PANDELLI did. A little later PANDELLI receivéd a call
from "WHITEY" BESASE, Toledo, Ohio, who instructed him to appear
with MOLLICA at the home;.of JIMMIE.LA FATCH in Akron, Ohio.

CV 344-c¢ advised PANDELLI refused fearing that he would
be "dumpéd".en route or at the meeting. PANDELLI called ANTHONY
MILANO at Cleveland in the. presence of MOLLICA and MILANO. talked
to MOLLICA at this time. He told him he was instructing PANDELLI
to accompany him to the meeting but that if a "hair on the head of
PANDELLI" was harmed, he would see that the whole bunch was taken
care of.

‘Cv 344=c stated PANDELLI went to Akron, Ohio, with MOLLICA
for the meeting at JAMES LA FATCH'S home. There were about 20 ;
persons present. After a dinner, all except PANDELLI, not a member,
retired to the basement where MOLLICA and MIKE ROMEO were interrogated.

of Pittsburgh as examples of "organization" members attempting to
determine his killer. He stated if DE NIRO was not a member, he
was a big source of income for the organization and had been
cooperative after having been "shaken down" by the "organization."

CV 344-¢ stated the "organization" made no inquiry of
him following the bombing murder of CAVALLARO and for his reason
he believed CAVALLARO was killed for getting out of line. He stated
if he had been killed without the sanction of the "organization",
they would have inquired as to who was responsible for the killing
of one of their members, He ‘stated that in his opinion, CAVALLARO
had a portion of DE NIRO's operation and apparently tried to "hog"
the entire operation after his death.

Regarding JASPER "FATS" AIELLO, JR., aka, the informant
advised he is no longer held in high respect because he has "gotten
out of line". by bad publicity and by engaging in armed robbery and
burglary. He stated that AIELLO had formerly been well thought of {
and in Youngstown, “he occupiéd about the same position at one time
as TONY DELSANTER occupies at present in Warren. He noted that
DELSANTER and AIBLLO are still close associates. .

 

, CV 344-c advised WILLIAM NAPLES, bombing murder victim
killed on 7/1/62, was killed because the "‘organization" learned
he was responsible for killing DE NIRO. According to the information
he received, thé NAPLES brothers were not part of either .the
Calabrese or Sicilian groups and did not contribute to either and
especially Cleveland. : .

Cv 344-c stated regarding the killing of DOMINIC MOO,
Canton, Ohio, whosé body was found stuffed in the trunk of his
car at Canton, Ohio, on 9/3/63, the "organization" made no iaquiry
about hisdeath or the parties responsible. This again would mean
to him .that MOIO "had gotten out of line.” “MOIO. had. Somehow
obtained employment with thé NAPLES brothers and unquestionably
"set up" BILLY NAPLES for his murder. GV 344-c stated MOTO may
have been eliminated when it was. learned through the newspapers
that he had-admitted to the FBI that he had driven BILLY NAPLES
to his "Joe Blow" car just before it blew up, killing him.

INFLUENCE AND STATURE OF..CALABRESE GROUP IN CLEVELAND ORGANIZATION
cv 344=-C advised the Calabrese group at Cleveland definitely

dominates the Sicilian when arguments and misunderstanding arise.

CV 92-748

CV 344-¢ stated that FRANK DE AUGUSTINI, Owner of the
Roman Gardens, Mayfield Road, section of Cleveland, is the second
in command in Cleveland under MILANO, He stated he did not
know FRANK BRANCATO well but he believed that he would be next
in command in the Calabrese group in Cleveland and under MILANO
and DE AUGUSTINI,.

CV 344-¢ stated that there would be two distinct groups
in the organization in the Cleveland area or in Northeastern Ohio
and as far west as Toledo. He stated’ the set up is unusual in
that the Calabrese group is more. highly respected than the Sicilian
group in the geographical area. He stated his opinion comes from
reactims to different. arguments which have arisen and would have
later been settled by meetings. He stated the Sicilian group
operates its own enterprises and there is apparently a pact that
they and the Calabrese will not encroach on each other's enterprises.

In this geographical area, the Sicilian group inclues
JAMES” LICAVOLI, aka Jack White, Cleveland; "WHITEY" BESASE of
Toledo. urdér LICAVOLI and ANGELO PERNA of Toledo under BESASE. He
Stated they have enterprises operating in Toledo.

Informant. . stated LICAVOLI has GUS DIMA as the representa-
tive at Sandusky, Ohio, who has his sources of income there. .

‘Informant stated’ PAT FERRUCCIO was the representative
for LICAVOLI for years, but lost out for some reason. FERRUCCIO
still a member. is not in good standing at present. cV 344-c stated
he has heard that a "BONES" BATTISTA of Canton, Ohio, is more or
less in control in that city at present. He had supported the
right candidate in a local election there and was able to operate,
but needed a "bank roll" for his operation. He sought. outside
help and, therefore, LEO MOCERI, ERNIE LA SALLE and ANTHONY DELSANTER
became his partners in a bookie and numbers operation.

. At Warren, Ohio, CV 344-c advised ANTHONY: DELSANTER™
became "boss" of the area when.MIKE FARAH, a Syrian, was murdered
(6/10/61). “The organization had put up with FARAH as long as he
had influence and had the politicians in his pocket. When. he
became. obstreperous and uncontrolable, the "organization" 'dumped":
him, He also stated that CHARLES IMBURGIA, operator of the
Sunrise Inn, East Market Street, Warren, Ohio, may now be affiliated
with the Sicilian group of LICAVOLI, but at one time several years

- ago he was part of the Pittsburgh group headed by RIPEPI.

_ At Akron, Ohio, the territory is controled by the
Sicilian. group operating in Toledo, Canton, Warren, and Youngstown,
Ohio. Cv 344-¢ advised that JAMES LA FATCH seemed to be the
represéenative of LICAVOLI in that area together with his brother,
TONY, and would be under the diréct supervision of "WHITEY" BESASE
of Toledo and LICAVOLI in Cleveland, Ohio.

. At Mansfield, Ohio; CV 344-¢ advised TONY MOLLICA is

an "organization" representative and although 4 Calabrese, will
"hustle" with the Calabrese and Sicilian groups. Informant does

not consider him a power, but sted he is a member of the "organiza-
tion" and operates the Ritz Bar in Mansfield, Ohio.

; At Youngstown, Ohio; the informant advised there are the
Same two groups in the "organization" as in Cleveland, Ohio. The
Calabrese has’ someaction and the Sicilian group under LICAVOLI
have their own ventures. Both have réspect for one another's
enterprises. The Calabresé in Youngstown are run by: DOMINIC MALLAMO
who is more or.'less the successor to PAUL ROMEO, brother of MIKE
ROMEO arid MALLAMO is close. to’ ANTHONY MILANO. in Cleveland. MALLAMO
is in a semi-retired position, but exacts tribute from those under
him. Second in command, taking a more active part and soon to be
the leading réprésentative of the Calabrese, is “JAMES. PRATO, aka
"Two Gun Jimmy" of Poland, Ohio, who is a nephew of MALLAMO, The
informant stated when the.:barbut game moved to Struthers, Ohio,
from Youngstown, Ohio, following the death of VINCE DE NTRO (7/17/61),
they moved the game in the property of thé CARABBIA brothers and
only put up with them since they controled the city administration
in Struthers, Ohio, to the extent they would be allowed to
operate without interference.

— He stated that young MIKE ROMEO, the son of PAUL ROMEO,
Campbell, Ohio, has some influence there as pointed out previously,
and is very close to JOHN BRAZZANO, the son of GIANNA: BRAZZANO,
deceased, who wasinvolved in the VOLPE murders in Pittsburgh.

Regarding the Sicilian group of the. "organization" in
Youngstown, CV.344-c ‘stated he could not say if VINCE.d..DE NIRO,
bombing victim of 7/17/61, was a member of thé "organization" or
not. He stated, however, that DE NIRO's murder caused great ~
concern among all members of the "organization." He stated that
of all the murders committed .in the Youngstown area, this was the
only murder where members of the “organization".made active efforts
to determine the persons responsible for Same. He cited inquiry
made by JAMES PRATO, JAMES TRIPODI, Steubenville, and TONY RIPEPI
