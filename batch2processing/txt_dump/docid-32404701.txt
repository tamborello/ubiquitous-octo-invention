HW 53216

I can make a mistake, because I will he guessing, and I am afraid to
say.

I do not remember, I remember exactly that it was in 1943.

And when did you leave the Komsomol?

In what year?

I left the Komsomol at the end of 1954.

I had to leave; you understand -- you can be in the Komsomol until you
are 27 yeard old, no older, if you are not elected to a high elective
post in the Komsomol.

So.

Just a minute.

I received a double punishment.

I was Secretary of a Komsomol organization, and I was relieved.

Well, this was not a punishment.

Where were you a Komsomol Secretary?

In the Second Chief Directorate (glavka), in the Second Chief Directorat

Of the entire Second Chief Directorate?

Yes,

There were only 13 or 15 Komsomol members, together with the typists.
From what time were you ((secretary)) there?

From 1943... 1953; to my thinking, in 1953, at the end of 1953, I was
elected Secretary of the Party organization of the Second Chief

Directorate.

Well, was this the Party ((organization) ) or the Komsomol ( (organization

B. The Komsomol organization.
A. You say that this was approximately at the end of 1953?

B. The reason I say approximately is because usually the elections are

held at the end of the year -- September, October, August....

A. What served as the basis for electing you Secretary?

You had just begun working there.

B. Wéll, I began working in March.
I think, you see why -~ the Komsomol organization was very small -= in
the main there were onky 4 or 5 from among the operational employees,
the rest were not operational but support people -- secretaries,

typists.

A. Approximately how many Komsomol members were there at that time in the

Second Chief Directorate?
B. About 15 people there.
A. But you must....

B. Well, the UODK is not included here; I have in mind that surveillance

does not enter in here -= in this Komsomol organization.
A. How do you say it -- UODK?

B. UODK == Dirvectorat for the Protection of the Diplomatic Corps.

Earlier it was called... this is surveillance over foreigners.
A. Earlier it was called what, and what is it now?
B. And now this UODK has been combined with the Seventh Directorate. |

A. What was the department of the Second Chief Directorate called which

given,
Nothing was said to me.
Only orally, several times at meetings, we were reminded of "moral

faults", “moral faults".

A. Why did the Komsomol not work it so == "for immoral conduct and for

moral faults"..,.

B. Likewise, there was no such working in the administrative decree;
instead, it said simply for the use of an operational document or dover
document... Administrative punishment of 15 days arrest was given me by
FEDOTOV .

Exactly the same kind of wording was used in the Komsomol .
And Komsomol did not deal with.... the idea is that the Komsomol must
take this up with me in detail... how this came about... who... what...

but they did not take this up.
A. Well, if you were a Komsomol member from 1953 to 1954....
B. Since 1943...

A. From 1943 to 1954... do you remember the month in which you became a

member?

B. I entered the Komsomol in 1943; I do not remember the month; I do not
remember .
It was in 1943 in Baku in the preparatory school, yes.

A. You do not remember the month?

B. I do not remember.

A. Was it.in winter, summer, spring, or fall?

B. No, I do not remember, I do not remember, I do not remember.

I am afraid to say.

A. From 1943 to 1954.
During this period while you were in the Komsomol, did youxreceive any

Komsomol punishments?

B. For the whole period in the Komsomol, I had only one punishment,

received in the KGB in 1954 -~- a severe reprimand and warning.

A. How was this written up?

For what was it given?
B. You see how it was....
A. We do not need an explanation; I know what you said earlier....
B. In the Komsomol, no... I just want to say one thing -- that the Komsomol
did not go into detail.
Apparently, such instructions had been given the Komsomol.
For using a cover document, an operational cover document, for
personal purposes....
A. For the use of....
B. Operational documents for personal purposes.
A,  ...Operational documents br personal purposes.

B. Yes.

A. And nothing more was said.

A, And you remember this wording exactly?

B. Yes absolutely.

And the same wording was used when an administrative punishment was

B. No, so I have, this is my only occupation....
Then, you see, there is a whole series of ways (prichina) by which it

is possible to check.

A. But what did you have in mind when you said "prison experience", that

you had....
B. I had in mind that....
A. ...At some time had prison experience?

B. Never in my life, with the exception of the time I was in the guard~
house.
I have in mind that I... have developed... prison experience, therefore

I....
((XG)) ((A and B speak at the same time)) =
A. ...A long time is necessary to develop and....

B. This is not long?
What do you mean?

It has been a great length of time.

A. There are people who sit in prison 10, 15, 20, 25 years, and even their
whole life; then, I understand, one will gain prison experience; it
develops; a person learns some other... but for you it has been only

a little more than a year.

B. One can serve time in different ways, one can serve time in different
ways.
You know, (XG) you yourself raised this question.
One can do time in different ways.
I understand it thus: a person is doing time; he knows why; let us say -
a criminal, he has killed someone, or he has robbed a bank, he has

robbed a person, he has raped someone; he knows why he is doing time.

Alright; a political offender, he knows why he is doing time, he knows
why he is doing time, and he has been given a sentence of 8, 10, 15, 20,
3 or 4 years, he counts off the time. .

While I do not know why I am doing time, absolutely; when on the basis
of suspicion alone, when precisely only in my position, a person who
has lost absolutely, absolutely everything; I absolutely have nothing,
and I do not have anyone, neither friends nor, well, I absolutely am
alone, quite alone.

There am I == a finished foul traitor, the most foul, who certainly has

already been sentenced to death; here I sit.

What are you thinking == that the hangman's rope has been waiting for

you for a long time?
I do not doubt this; of this, I have no doubt.

Do you still think that... you will not find an answer to the question:

"Why are you here"?

Because they do not believe me.

It is the only reason.

If the question stands thus, I think that we might continue our

conversation; perhaps, finally, anyway, we will find, as.I said in our
last meeting, we will find a common language.

Perhaps you will give me supporting information (podtverzhdeniye),
something other than what you said earlier.

The last time we began to speak of your arrival in Moscow in 1952, when
you said that you had arrived there from the Baltic.

I think that perhaps we will go back a little bit and throw some light
on one more question.

I wanted to ask you -= before this, how many years were you in the

Komsomol?

From 1943 to 1954.

TRANSLATION

A, How are things today?
B. (?Concerning what?)
A. In general; condition; mood.

B. What kind of good mood can I be in?
I have been sitting here 481 days -- that is, 16 months; one year
plus four months of a second year.

(2G)

A. Is it a secret or not, how you are counting?
Why do you think it has been 481; why do you think that you are not

mistaken?

B. No, it is no secret; no, no, absolutely.
You understand; it already, so to speak, has been developed, as is
said, I have acquired some kind of prison experience,
The habit of counting, etc., has been developed, and it has changed.
Well, you understand, if I had counted from the very beginning, day by
day, and each day, I would have become confused, but having come to a
definite date, you throw out this date, but here you know: exactly a
year has been completed, let us say, the third of April completes a
year exactly.

A. I am judging by myself; I would have been lost, of course, being in

such a situation, I think; I would not know how to calculate accurately.
