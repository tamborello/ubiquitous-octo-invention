; ;
of the DFS and 2 Mexia “Army demolition men recovering
the explosives, GUTIERREZ BARRIOS indicated that with
the information furnished by the Miami Office his men had
no difficulty in locating and recovering these objects,
Inasmuch as no individual descriptions of the photographs
were obtained from DFS'‘and they are basically self-
explanatory, no descriptive list is being set rortn.(Q) 2?

As the Bureau and Miami are aware, on 5/3/67 a bomb
of low power was apparently thrown into the courtyard of the
Cuban Embassy at Mexico, D,F,, and exploded underneath the
automobile usually occupied by t Cuban Ambassador to Mexico
JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ arias. (tne DFSfis of the opinion that the G
bombing is the work of so! exil€ group’very likely based in
Florida and on this basis a telephone call. was made by th
Mexico City Office to Miami on 5/4/67 and(as a result prg3CsJ
could be assured that FRANK FIORINI was in Miami on that
date Leads to determine the whereabouts of otner logical
sus ts, including the other Cuban suspects in this case,
are being handled under the caption "ANTI-FIDEL CASTRO
