Letter to Mexico City

Re:-- LEE HARVEY OSWALD
105~82555

 

N

4 Mora has also advised that Mary Louise Camacho, nee
’ Patterson, knew Oswald while he was in Russia, {Greater detail
from Mora on this point is extremely pertinent since CIA may
have Camacho questioned in Russia abeyt t she knows of
Oswald and his activities while there YW
Finally, Mora has furnished some information on
“Oswald's visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, We
should determine ail Mora knows about this visit and where
she obtained her information,.

This matter must be pursued in depth until we have
fully explored and exhausted all of Mora‘'s information, These
questions, which, the original information @ived from Mo
hase raised, cannot be left unanswered and ~18 and MEX=1 iB ey
should be made fully aware of this. Of course, in receiving
further information from Mora, care must be taken to distinguish

} that information which is speculation and belief on Mora's part
from that which is factual,

\

J
iN Advise innédiately- whether fifix-18 and MEX-19 att 2
recontacted Mora for the two-or threé-day period as 1g) tive! ‘
If so, promptly furnish letterhead memorandum suitalie for
\ dissemination, Ju) ,
