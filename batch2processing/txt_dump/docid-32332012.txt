alleged communist infiltration in the Cuban armed forces.
"Time" Magazine described Pilot LANZ as one of the authentic
heroes of the Cuban Rebellion who flew weapons from the
United States into rebel territory. The article stated that
-LANZ was the object of a nation-wide man-hunt in Cuba following
his resignation and since news broadcasts in Pittsburgh on
7/12/59, pointed out that Major LANZ had been granted asylum
in the United States and would appear before the Senate
Internal Security Sub-Committee on 7/13/59, the Pittsburgh
Office requested Bureau authority for Washington Field to
conduct a complete interview.

The Bureau has since authorized an interview with Major
LANZ when he concludes his testimony before the Senate Sub-
Committe and the Committee has no further interest in Major
LANZ,

Previous investigation in this case indicates the possibility
that Major LANZ may be acquainted with JOSEPH MEROLA and
NORMAN ROTHMAN, both of whom are exceptionally familiar with
the Cuban interior in connection with MANNARINO slot machine
interests in Camaguey and Santiago de Cuba. As a matter of
information, Camaguey is located some 75 miles from CASTRO's
wartime command post in the Sierra Maestra Mountain Range.

of the Pittsburgh Office) and JOHN MOLDOVAN of Farrell,

Pa., told him several months ago that they had been approached

by JOHN and PHIL SCARDINA of Sharon, Pa., to pull the Armory

job in Canton. PCI further advised that his brother and MOLDOVAN
refused to accept the score but referred the S€ARDINA brothers

to JAMES ZIMMERMAN and WILLIE NAPOLI. PCI pointed out that

ZIMMERMAN and NAPOLI also refused to accept the job because it
involved a Federal violation but added that ZIMMERMAN and NAPOLI
made arrangements for the S€ARDINAS to contact: SANDY NAPLES of
Youngstown, Ohio. PCI stated that he did not know the identity
of those who actually pulled the score at the Armory but he is

under indictment in Pittsburgh in connection with the Armory

12 million dollars worth of Canadian Government Bonds, Jewelry
and Cash from a burglary of the Brockville Trust and Savings
Company, Brockville, Ontario, Canada, on 5/3-4/58. Canadian

pledging of $140,500 worth of the stolen Canadian Government
Bonds. MANNARINO and ROTHMAN were also charged in the

WILLIAM RABIN was also arrested by Bureau Agents in Miami,
Florida, with ROTHMAN on 7/2/59, anc they are now at kiberty under
$5,000 bond along with MANNARINO,

RABIN, during previous interviews with Bureau Agents in the
EZHAYA case, has stated that. he received the bonds. pledged

in Switzerland and Chicago from one ALFREDO GARCIA, not

further identified, in return for his services andanticipated
purchase of weapons for FIv#L CASTRO. On the basis. of
investigation in the EZHAYA case, it appears that’ the

bonds were turned over to the MANNARINO combination in Montreal,
Canada, in late August, 1958, by RENE ROBERT, It has been
determined from one of the co-conspirators that sometime in
1957, MANNARINO, ROTHMAN and their confederates received certain
gambling rights in Cuba from the BATISTA Government and
reportedly moved 2,000 slot machines into the Havana area.
During the ensuing period, up to the summer of 1958, the slots
became less and less profitable due to larceny from the machines
and also because of the increasing charges placed upon the
operation of the machines by the BATISTA ‘Government. Accordingly,
MANNARINO began watching the activities of FIDEL CASTRO and

his 26 July Movement with a view toward gaining favor with

him in the event the Rebellion was successful. The MANNARINO
combine desired to secure a large sum of money which would

«~ be used to purchase a bank in Europe and the eventual purchase

of arms and ammunition for the Cuban Rebellion. It is
indicated that these hoodlums considered the possibility that
CASTRO might be defeated. Consequently, they laid plans
simultaneously for furnishing military aid and assistance to
the BATISTA forces. Apparently, during 1957, a plan was
formulated to transfer. 3 million dollars to a bank in Europe
for the purchase of arms, The transfer was to be handled

by: WILLIAM W, RABIN, a Chicago, Illinois, business consultant
and fomer front. for MANNARINO in an unsuccessful venture into
the jukebox manufacturing business in Chicago during 1947.

As plans further developed, RABIN reportedly planned to transfer
10 million dollars to a European bank in excKange for a fee of
$250,000. .

Dr. JAMES THORNTON McCLOWRY, MD, a PCI of the Pittsburgh
Office,,on 7/2/59, advised SA THOMAS G, FORSYTH, III, that
he had examined SAM MANNARINO'S medical records on file at the
Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh. It is recalled that MANNARINO

underwent surgery at Mercy Hospital during the summer of
1958, for the removal of an alleged cyst from his intestinal
tract. Dr. McCLOWRY pointed out that the medical record

he examined on MANNARINO showed only that an exploratory
operation was performed by Dr. GEORGE REGIS MILLER, Chief
Surgeon at Mercy Hospital, and that. the medical report while
describing the surgical techniques involved in some detail,
made-no mention whatever of the reason ir the exploratory
operation, Dr. McCLOWRY described this as somewhat of an
unusual recording since it was obvious that the physician
performing the operation did not want his findings made

a matter of record. Dr. McCLOWRY went on to say that in

the interest of obtaining a clear picture of MANNARINO's
state of health, he was able to discreetly obtain a copy

of another medical record on MANNARINO in the private office
of Chief Surgeon GEORGE REGIS MILLER. According to Dr.
McCLOWRY, this record discloses that MANNARINO is suffering
from a spreading cancer in his lower abdomen which was
discovered during the operation in the summer of 1958.

The record indicates that MANNARINO is undergoing radiation
and cobalt treatments at Mercy Hospital and Dr. McCLOWRY 's
diagnosis is that MANNARINO will probably die sometime within
the next 12 months.

Dr. McCLOWRY, on 7/23/59, advised SAS FORSYTH and DOUCE that

SAM MANNARINO got in touch with him several days ago and
requested that he become his personal physician. Dr. McCLOWRY
said that the introduction to MANNARINC was arranged by the
Reverend NICKOLAI FUSCO, Pastor of the St. Peters Roman
Catholic Church in New Kensington. Dr. McCLOWRY mentioned

that he had discussed the possible: treatment of MANNARINO with
Father: FUSCO who appeared to be very concerned that MANNARINO
might have cancer and he wanted Dr. McCLOWRY to become his ;
physician as soon as possible and conduct necessary examinations
ana tests in an effort to confirm his suspicions. Dr. McCLOWRY
told Father’ FUSCO that he would examine MANNARINO at the first.
