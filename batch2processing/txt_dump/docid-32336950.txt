seonquer this territory, Parallel with this, instructions were
' to be given to guerrillas in Spain to organize 2 general up-
rising there, — ay vo ; ;

A Double Agent a .

oe In the meantime, MENOYS revealed Himself to be a-
double agent. On the way back te Cuba, he contacted; in Madrid,
OTTO SKORZENY, the man who had liberated MUSSOLINI. No. precise
details, however, are furnished about this encounter. .

_ . ... Once in Cuba, MENOYA would wait for the first part

of the plan, the seizure of the. "Santa-Haria,"” to be realized
) before fleeing to the United States with nineteen of fis com- (5) !

panions on board three ship's boats. We presume that he was |
eager to inform the American authorities as to the position
of the steamer which he knew and which permitted American’ .

 
 
 

authorities to fiad it again.

   
 

Ieeason —

_.  Leaders.of "drill" in Havana hastened to cable to Cap-
tain "GALVAO,"” informing him of MENOYQ's treason. Simultaneously,
orders were issued te the Spanish guerrillas to abandon their ;
insurrection plans. , °

: "Bohemia," which published photocopies of these
telegrams, adds that HENOYO and his companions are now interned
by American immigration authorities in the State of Texas where
an investigation of this mysterious affair is being conducted.
