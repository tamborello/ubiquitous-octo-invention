Mr. Moss Lee Innes,

Ottawa, Ontario.

Re: Ilando CAPOLINO; Guido CAPOLINO;
Samuel (Sam) MANNARINO.

 

 

In our correspondence of 23-Nov-65, para. 7,
mention is made that the CAPOLINOs had issued a cheque
for $2,200.00, drawn on a Canadian bank in Toronto.

Subsequent enquiries now indicate that the
GiPOLINos have an account with the Royal Bank of Canada,
Montreal Branch, Place Ville Marie, Montreal, P.Q., rather
than with a Bank in Toronto.

36 Enquiries conducted in Montreal indicate that
this bank has a customer's account under name of CAPOLINO,
however, bank officials would not divulge the number of

this account nor the first name of the person who has same.
It was learned, however, that one of the CAPOLINOs had
opened this account with the Royal Bank of Canada prior to
July 1965, with a deposit of $5,406.28, Bank officials were
reluctant to supply any additional, details with regard to
this account, without a court order. Therefore, under the
circumstances the matter was not pursued further.

he Confidential information received from another
source indicates that the account in question may be under
the name of Ilando CAPOLINO and that there have been a large
number of cheques drawn to this account. The last cheque
known to have been issued by Ilando CAPOLINO was on 10-Dec-65
in the amount of $49.49, payable to Northern Mountain Airlines
Limited in B.C. Enquiries indicate that this was cheque

#505 and that the CAPOLINOs have a Current Account with

the Royal Bank in Montreal.
