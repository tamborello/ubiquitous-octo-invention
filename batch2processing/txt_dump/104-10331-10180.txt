_ 3. (C) | In discussions with the Board staff we have
attempted to focus any new tasking on those areas in which
they have expressed their greatest concern. It ia
imperative, however, that we satisfy the Board on these
issues or the Agency will be subject to a determination by
the Board that we are not in compliance with the JFK Act.
Because of the impending statutory termination of the Board
and their need to issue their report, there is some urgency
associated with the conduct and completion of these
searches. The searches must be completed by 6 August, 1998.

4. (8S) Databases to be Searched. The addressees to
this memorandum are requested to perform new searches—-using
the search terms in paragraph 5--on ANY of your files which
may contain information relating in any way to the JFK
assassination, including, in particular, all records systems
or £iles containing information on:

e James J. Angleton and his files

* Debriefings of defectors in which ANY reference to Oswald
or the JFK assassination occurs (Example, : )

5. (U) Search Terms and Time Periods. These new
searches should focus on documents that might be retrievable
with the following search terms over the referenced periods:

 

® The period 1959-1965 using the search terms Executive
Action, Exaction, Ex Action,

4. (S) CIC is reviewing all soft files using the new
search terms and has found one hit thus far which may have been
reported in an earlier search.

In an undated soft file labeled "NOSENKO Study by
Hart/Commentary" contains NOSENKO's comments on what he knew
about Oswald from his work in the KGB, discussing mainly
Oswald's attempt to commit suicide in the Soviet Union.

We are currently reviewing the historical soft files for the
terms noted in Ref and will advise if any additonal hits surface.

5. We believe that all of Angleton’s files are archived and
maintained by IMS. In the 1978-79 period, the ban on the
destruction of Angleton’s Files, which was imposed by the Church
committee, was lifted, and a number of files were destroyed
pursuant to the applicable records destruction schedule.

: Assassination Records

REFERENCE: (AIUO) Bulletin OIM- EB No. 02-98,
dated 22 July 1998

*

1, (U) The JFK Board has made a number of recent
specific directed requests to assure that the Agency has ;
complied fully with the requirements of the JFK Act. Among
these was a request for issuance of the Reference Employee
Bulletin, in which the DCI directed that employees leave “no

stone unturned” in assuring that relevant documents are
provided to the Commission.

2. -(U) In part because relevant new documents have
surfaced within the past few months, the Board has also
requested specific focus on renewed searches of the Agency’s
“counterintelligence files.” The new documents have
surfaced due to a variety of reasons, including references
to assassination related personalities in recent defector
reports, records made available because of the break up of
the. Soviet Union, and advances in search capabilities due to
digitization of older paper files.
