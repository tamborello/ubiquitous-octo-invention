3. Regarding Itkin's allegations of contact with the Agency
during the period 1954-1961, Mr, Sam Papich noted that the

Frank CARR
Jim GIULIANO
Don SURINE

CARR, he said, was Chief of the Investigative Staff and would certainly
have known of any contacts maintained by McCarthy under circumstances
alleged by Itkin. Mr. Papich did not know CARR's present whereabouts.
GIULIANO was an assistant. He was last reported to have been practicing
law in Washington, Both GIULIANO and CARR are quite approachable,
Mr. Papich thought, He recommended against querying Mr. SURINE.
