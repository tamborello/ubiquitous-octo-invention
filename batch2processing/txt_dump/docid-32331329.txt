commented that he, JOE CASEY and CHARLIE THE BLADE were then
staying at the Regent Hotel in Newark, New Jersey, on the lam
in quarters provided by the "BOOT".

Informant said that he has no particular knowledge
of CASEY's killer but would be alert for any information he
might receive concerning this matter. He commented that he
feels it would not be logical that RICHIE BOIARDO would have
anything to do with it because if he were so inclined,
he would have had CASEY killed at the time CASEY kéftetiim on
the street following an unsucessful effort to kill RICHIE
BOIARDO many years ago.
