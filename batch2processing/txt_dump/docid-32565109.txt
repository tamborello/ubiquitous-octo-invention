RUSSELL A.~ BUFALINO;

SUMMARY

PCI[—~™~C J kchviSed SA JOHN W. REINHARD OTHER 4
that he received information from a source he considers :
reliable and who would be in a position to obtain informa-
tion concerning subjéct, to the effect that the subject
during 1961 was instrumental in bringing ET
‘a gambler from Massachusetts into the Scranton, Pa., area.

This was done because BUFALINO at the time was in need of

money. LANZETTA, using information from track areas and

sure bets, hit the bookies in the Scranton area very badly. i
Finally the bookies refused to accept any bets from LANZETTA. i
LANZETTA left area at end of 1961 and reportedly has returred

to Massachusetts. The activities of LANZETTA, according to

the informant, were with and on behalf of the subject.
