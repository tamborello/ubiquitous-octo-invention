Lincoln Brigade members in Spain, he is now closely associated with
them and is active in Communist Party work. The same Informant states
that MARCUS lives at TUTTLE'S home and has stated that he could have
married TUTTLE'S daughter, aged 17. TUTTLE was associated with BIBERMAN
in sponsoring the Motion Picture Democratic Committee and the Hollywood

League for Democratic Action, former Communist front. organizations; and ;

he is described by various Informants as a rabid Commmist. Dr. FRANK
KNOWLIN, proprietor of a West Hollywood hospital has advised that he has
personally attended parties at the TUTTL® residence, to which prominent
Hollywood personages were invited. Russian entertainers performed at
these parties and Russian motion pictures were shown.. The parties usually
lasted all night, and as the guests left, they were usually presented for
signature with a check drawn on,their own banks in sums ranging ag high
as $1,000.00, "for the cause." The Informant stated that it was a matter
of common knowledge that these checks were for the Communist Party, though
he was not certain as to the identities of the payees of the checks. ;

Various Informants have advised that TUTTLE was concerned with
the making of a motion picture alleged to depict the horrors and sufferings -
of modern warfare, and which was financed by TUTILE to the extent of $2,100.00.
In connection with the making of the picture, which was described by the ,
informants as pacifist in nature and aimed at the American preparedness
program, one of the associates of TUTTLE was overheard to say, "By the time
we get this picture out, the Government will have us either in Leavenworth
Penitentiary or in a concentration camp."

TUTTLE was described by JOHN L. LEECH, a former Communist Party
organizer and member of the Commnist Party State Executive Committee in sworn
testimony before a Grand Jury as an active organiser for the advancement of
the Communist cause. : .

As of interest to this investigation, attention is invited to
a letter from the Denver Field Division to all Field Divisions and the
Bureau, dated August 11, 1941. Accompanyirig said letter was a memorandum
entitled, "Communist Party Set-Up." This purported to be a list of revisions
in the Communist Party set-up nationally, and it was obtained by Denver
Confidential Informant Dr. 57, from a source which that Informant described

“as the Communist Party letter received by JAMES ALLANDER, “District Organiser —

of the Commnist Party, District #19; Denver, Colorado. The memorandum:
recited changes in perdonnel and office addresses in Communist Party
Districts 1 to 23, and in connection with District #13, California and
Nevada, it contained the following statement: "JOHN HOWARD LAWSON with
HERBERT BIBERMAN will be~in control of the Intellectuals and Motion Picture
Comrades in the Hollywood area,"

It is recalled that the Bureau letter of August'7, 1941.
