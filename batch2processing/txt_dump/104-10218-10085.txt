SOLVE PROBLEM OF LIRLUCK'S RESIDENCE LICOOKY APARTMENT, STATION

WITHOUT THUS REVEALING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH LICOOKY. PRESUMABLY
HE WILL RESPOND THAT HE HAS SENT WIFE FUNDS TO JOIN HiM HEXICO.
IF SHE PLANS STAY WITH HIM PERMANENTLY, THEN LICOOKY PROBLEH WILL
BE ALLEVIATED. IF HER STAY ONLY TEMPORARY, THEN CORRECTIVE ACTION
(AS SUGGESTED IN 8EF) COULD BE TAKEN IF NECESSARY. FEEL THAT THIS

 

COULD BE RASIEST SOLUTION TO PROBLEM AS NEITHER AGENT WOULD BE
FORCED TO CROOSE BETWEEN OTHER OR KUBARK.
2. WIFE'S ARRIVAL MEXI OF INTEREST iN ITSELF TO HDQS AS THIS
_ WILL HAVE EFFECT ON LINLUCK MOBILITY. WE ARE CURRENTLY COKSIDERING
