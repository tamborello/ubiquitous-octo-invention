Suoject: Background on Mexico Station Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)
1, (Unilatera? jooverage. From the time the Mexico Station was opened ins
; (Hein 1912) (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Yin Scott as COS in 1958, Charles
Anderson III (stilt in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus idncanineaie: De
exploit leads. from the ‘Soviet Enbassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT) —

consisted of multi Line phone taps, three phote sites, a mobile Surveillance - ,

team and a mail intercept operation.

 

 

a. Fhone taps were placed/ k

handled by y avid WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines

“tapped was Linited Poy availability of a listening post: nearby

‘(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/
Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Cech, ete) trenseribers. “Generally
these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican snerican} -were related -
(which the station at that tine felt was good security in that
if. they talked about: shop,” they would talk to each other.) ~

.b. ffhree photo sites/were handled by Anderson with the kelp

of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD
people checking the best type of camera » film, and concealment
' devices, These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LEaTED, ILnre,
