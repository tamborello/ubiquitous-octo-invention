NOTE: GID, in attached letter to the Assistant Attorney General
dated September 8, 1976, responded to a request from Assistant
Attorney General Thornburgh for information from our files.

The September 8 response, based on an indices search using

the spelling of Lorenz's name as furnished by Senator Schweiker
to the Department of Justice, resulted in no record being located.
Investigation in the Roselli Obstruction of Justice case,

however, reveals the files upon which this letter is based. On
September 9, 1976, when the information on Lorenz was located,

Mr. Gerald Shur, Criminal Division, Department of Justice,

was immediately contacted and advised that information

regarding Lorenz would be forthcoming. Shur stated he would
attach a note to that effect onto the September 8, 1976 letter

so that the Assistant Attorney General would be aware that

the information was forthcoming. This letter furnishes the
information regarding Lorenz to the Assistant Attorney General. (\)
