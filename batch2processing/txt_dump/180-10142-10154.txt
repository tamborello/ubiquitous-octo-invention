I do not mean to suggest that the reason is sinister or
innocent, but according to cable traffic, the Mexicg city
station, anyway, is not telling you about it.

Mr, Scelso. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let us look at CIA number 211.

Mr. Scelso. What was the nature of that 9/27 contact?

Mr. Goldsmith. If you would like, you can review the

transcript again. Essentially, it was a conversation between

bs i Bes . ; , P
Soviet Duran and Soviet Embassy, or consulate officials

ey

ii 4 in respect to Oswald's obtaining a visa and the problem of

obtaining a visa.

Reading through CIA number 211, can you identify that?

 

 

Mr. Scelso. I suppose this was

 

 

un

ig Mr. Goldsmith. Correct.

Why do you think that, in paragraph 3, the person send- *

ing the cable considered the fact chat t

of it, and passing the information along would be important?

Mr. Scelso. You get into a psychological question. The

Mr. Scelso. This was all on the same day.

Mr. Goldsmith. The cable traffic was pretty neavy on
that day, I would imagine.

Mr. Scelso. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. This cable is the first time that the
Mexico City station informs Headquarters about Oswald's
9/27 contacts.

Mr. Scelso. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you think that there is any connec-
tion between the fact that this contact was recorded after
the Mexico City station became aware of the fact that] Litensoz
knew about Oswald's contacts?

Mr. Scelso. I would imagine that there were probably

’
‘(many -- several Mexicans | transcribing reels transcribing

things and some got finished before others.

Mr. Goldsmith. This was months ago. The conversations
have been transcribed and reviewed months earlier.

Mr. Scelso. What are the numbers of the various cables:
They were all going out in a series. They may have had
several analysts in the Mexico Station working on them. One
said you take this one and write a cable and the other said
you take chat one and write a cable, and so on, and they went

out and went into the COMM Center and the COMM Center sent

them out in some order. Here. <
