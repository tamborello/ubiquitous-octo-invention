(2) a proposal to survey the possibility of establishing a strike
ase in Nicaragua; (3) the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military
men to CIA. "Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700

Cubans is any longer practicable. He said that it had been his understanding that

 

   

the“current thinking contemplated-figures-more on the order~of 3,000." Mr:-Bartes

 

 

replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as
a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as
3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed
it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in
addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.
