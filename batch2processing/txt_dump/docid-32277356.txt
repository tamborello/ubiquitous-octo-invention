_DATE:. March 29, 1978.

RE:

Eileen Dinneen and Jim Conzelman

 

Secret Service Index File and Commission Documents
United States Archives

The materials found in the National Archives regarding Secret
Service investigations included eight boxes of index cards and
nine boxes of documents and-reports. The total number of index
cards was in excess of 5000. These cards included addresses,
phone numbers, P.O. boxes, and names of individual subjects.

The file boxes (9) encompassed, for the most part, Secret Service
Control Number reports with related correspondence. All of these
Materials were given to the custody of the U.S. Archives by the
Secret Service as vart of the JFK investigation.

I.

Secret Service Index Cards

A.

These cards were reviewed with specific attention being
paid to Cuban names, right wing activists, potential
threats against President Kennedy, possible Secret Ser-
vice cover-up, and improved procedures in the protection
of the President. A list was drawn up in reference to
the above. Each card was then checked to locate the
attending report. Due to the lack of a systematic filing
system, index cards prepared by the Secret Service could
not be easily collated to the files. Therefore, the
following cards which could not be located were given to
Mike Lehy to cross check against Archive files. (See
attachment A)

It is understood that not all materials originally given
by the Secret Service to the National Archives are still
in their custody. Some documents have been returned. rt
is foreseen, therefore, that many of these files will have
to be reviewed at Secret Service Headquarters. :

-Includes "protection while xiding in vehicles"
(discusses fact that motorcycles should NOT flank

-Pg. 56-7 "If great danger is suspected, the occupants
of buildings facing parade routes should be checked
and a person of known reliability should be given the
responsibility in each location of assuring that no
suspicious persons are allowed at windows or on roof
tops in the danger area." Note “at windows or on
roof tops" is specifically stated. This is contrary
to testimony given by several secret service agents.

~Discusses crowd and mob control, handling cranks.
-"Identification of Guests, Visitors, and Employees"-
page 86. “In 1935 an attempt was made to assassinate
the Premier of China. The assassin, impersonating a
newspaper man, was allowed to enter with the press,
and fired 15 shots at the Premier before being subdued
by the guards. Here we, see that the Secret Service
Manual had an example of” ‘assassination attempt for

their agents to study, yet Jack Ruby was able to
impersonate a newsman and fatally wound Oswald.
-Emergencies ~ counter attacks. Does mention that
the nearest personnel would pursue attacker while
rest close ranks. This is also in contrast to tes-
timony given the Warren Commission. Agents stated
that ALL personnel are to stay with their man (JFK)
and thus no agents stayed behind in Dealey Plaza to
help with the investigation. ;
