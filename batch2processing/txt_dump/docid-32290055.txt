He advised to minimize expenses he sells this information to
RAYMOND ROLLING. He advised that it is his understanding
that other handbook operators have similar arrangements.

The Bureau's attention is directed to the follow-

Report of SA T, M. HENDRICKS, JR., 11/22/61.~ -

Investigation reflected that none of the above
individuals possess federal wagering stamps. The baseball
inning tickets are alleged to be drawn from a device
similar to a punchboard on an imaginary game between teams
of the A&merican and National Leagues. These tickets are
sold throughout the day in Meridian, mostly to Negroes and
then sometime each day there is a machine from which
colored balls are dropped into a trough representing nine
innings of a baseball game. -Winners are determined from
use of this machine. The operation of this baseball inning
ticket game may constitute a lottery which will bring it
in the jurisdiction of the U. S. Treasury Department and
the operators might be required to possess federal wagéring F
stamps. By separate letter Mr. JAMES J. ENOCH, District
Director, Internal Revenue Service, Jackson, Miss., is |
‘being advised of the above.
