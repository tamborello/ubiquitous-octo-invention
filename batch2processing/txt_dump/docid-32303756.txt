1962, the son of ANGELO CULMO and NICHOLAS PATTI, also

from the Ansonia, Connecticut, area, came to the informant's
place ef business along with FRANK PICCOLO. Several tele=-
phone calls were made from informant’s td&ephone by PICCOLO
who remarked to the informant that he was straightening out
the Ansonia situation, as to who should have control, In-
