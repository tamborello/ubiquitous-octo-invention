5, Vhe effect on the exiles and their activities will be
varied, Basically, theiy motives are, first, nopefully to
ermbroil the U.S. A, on thelr side, secondly, to establish ineir

the non-activist type Cuban exile wherever he is to conclude
that the U.S. is unwilling to permit “Sreetancing” Cuban
exiles to forces or create U.S. policy in the Caribbean by their

javulnerable. ‘This leads him unhappily to the conclusion that
the U.S. has no immediate, drarnatic plan for tha restoration
of democracy to Cuba. They will use the hard term ‘co~
