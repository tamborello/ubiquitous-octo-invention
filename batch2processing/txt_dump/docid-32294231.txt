JFK Act 6 (4)

CG 87-19740

A review of Chicago file 166-86; Bureau file
166-450; New York file 166-102, captioned "FELIX ANTHONY
ALDERISIO, aka; ET AL; ALAN IRVING SEGAL; SEYMOUR DANIEL
SEGAL - VICTIMS; ITAR - EXTORTION" reflects that the
New York Division is office of origin in this case and
as such is in possession of the full complete facts.
Accordingly the Chicago Division is not submitting a
summary of this case and the same is being left to the
New York Office, due to the fact that this would only
entail a duplication of effort.

. per[__ and CG 6656-PC-TE both advised
that they are familiar wi ALDERISIO's current activities.
Both of these individuals stated that it is impossible
to determine as to whether ALDERISIO was in Miami, Florida,
in March or April, 1962, because in dealing with ALDERISIO°
no one asks him any questions. or delves into his business.

 

The Chicago Division is not reviewing the records
of CCC pertaining to a flight of BRAY's from Miami to
Chicago and return inasmuch as this information was
previously obtained including the flight coupon actually -
: utilized by BRAY, which was forwarded to Miami ‘by; Chicago
} airtel to Miami dated 5/6/63 (10). For the information
1 of the Bureau, this information pertaining to the expense
accounts of CHARLES W. BRAY is set forth on page 4 of
report of SA JOHN P, LENIHAN at Miami dated 6/7/63.

 

Investigation continuing Chicago.
