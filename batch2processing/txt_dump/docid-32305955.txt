Honorable William P. Rogers
‘Attorney General

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has furnished to us a large
number of reports reflecting interviews by FBI Agents of defendants and
co=conspirators i in the Apalachin case. ~

<

 

The material furnished is of the greatest value. Several of the
reports, for example, summarize interviews taken just a few days after
the Apalachin meeting and bear out clearly the pattern of falsehood
which is in the heart of the conspiracy charged.

Much of the material furnished will certainly be affirmative
evidence in support of the Government's case; a good portion of the :
balance will be most useful. for purposes of crossexamination and other-
wise. All of the material reflects the FBI's. uniformly excellent
investigative techniques.

| thought you should be informed of the important contribution
that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is making to the success of the
Apalachin case.
Respectfully yours,

Mclitrllllicad

Milton Re Wessel
