_ Pe Liaison.

This project contributes to the friendly attitude of the Mexican Govern-
ment officials. Regarding the assassination of President Kennedy, Willard C.
Curtis alerted Mexican officials oh 23 November to selected LIENVOY coverage
of the Cubsn Embassy. As a result they took immediate action favorable to
PBPRIME, they made arrests, conducted interrogations, rejected the Cuban
Babassy protest note and killed the Sevist propaganda effort to place the blame
on minority groups in PRPRINE, With wide presa play, Nexican Forelg Ninister, —
Mamuel Tello, publicly.ordéred the Mexican Ambassador in Cuba to return the
protest note as unacceptable and nol in Eeeping with diploaatic protocol.

Q. Interagency Coordination. 7

outaide KUBARK who ia aware of this project. There is no coordination in this
regard.

REQUEST FOR PROJECT LIENVOY RENEWAL

A. Current Objectives.

The objectives of this project remain the same as those stated in the
last renewal request. The project contimes to provide the Mexico Station with
same rapid to { D tThe only major change
which will occur in the next project year is al_.._.____| It is too early
to determine how this change will affect the operation of LIENVOY. The COs
Mexico has been asaured that LIENVOY will remain in operation but LITENSOR vante
it to continue as is for an as yet undetermined length of time. All aajor
objectives of the project are being effectively realized.

Be Changes.

In the last project renewal request, it vas planned to move the intercept
center for security reasens. This move has been held in abeyance pending sone
indication from LITENSCR on how his successor will feel about the future of
LIENVOY and the manner he wishes it to operate. The security of the premises has
been tightened and it is believed that LITENSOR cau handle any problems which
might arise.

C. Intelligence Production.

Each month an operational report is forvarded to Headquarters listing the
dispatches, cables, and intelligence reports based on LIENVOY production.

In September 1963 Paul V. LEVISTER (ps), Headquarters KUTUBE officer, came
to Mexico on temporary duty to review the LIENVOY and LIFEAT projects as examples
of technical operations producing a high rate of positive intelligence, It is
suggested that the study prepared by this officer be reviewed in connection with
this request for renswale

D Effectiveness.
‘The nn t provide the same | to the
highest level hich is more effective with each year of

operation. The daily “reaumen" from the di urrent
intelligence as well as background data on The
Cuban section at the station would be seriously handicapped without the daily

transeriptes on the Cuban Embassy lines, fhe same is true for the Soviet and
Soviet Sattellite coverage. Background information from LIENVOY on thase
officials has lead to successful rectultments in the Cuban and the Tugoslav
Exbassies.

R, Problems.

There have been no significant security, cover, control or liaison
problems during the past year.

late President Kennedy, the Chief of Station alerted” Mexican
officials to selécted LIENVOY coverage of the Cuban Embassy which
€oncerned Lee OSWALD. AS a result they took immediate action
favorable to PBPRIME ‘by making appropriate arrests, conducting
interrogations, rejecting a Cuban Embassy protest note, and
killing a Soviet propaganda effort to place the blame on minority
groups in PBPRIME.

In December 1963, 8 KUBARK official traveled to Mexico with a
visual presentation concerning the Cuban arms cache in Venezuela.
_There he gave a Special briefing to LITENSOR, pointing out the
authenticity of the Cuban origin of these arms, and thus contri-
buting significantly to a reaction by the Mexican Government on
this important inter-American matter favorable to ODYOKE.

 

 

 

 

In connection with a to several East
and West European countries in March and April 1963, the Station
was provided several briefing papers on these countries, prepared

channels if he so wished.

8 Inter-Agency Coordination: No formal inter-Agency co-

‘ordination {is required tn this Project. The Chief, PRSWING, Mexico,
is the only ODYOKE representative in Mexico outside KUBARK who is

aware of this project and its proviston for a
Such matters as the special briefing on the arms cache

in Venezuela were discussed in detail with him.

 

9. Plans: No significant operational changes are planned
during the coming Project year. In December 1964 LITENSOR will
probably be replaced by LITEMPO-2. This should cause no major
adjustments since the Station is already on good terms with
LITEMPO-2 under the LITEMPO Project. It is anticipated that
LITEMPO-2 will continué the intercept program without change.

10. Funds: Approval is requested for the renewal of the
 

 

 

LIENVOY Project for the period 1 February 1964 through 31 January
1965 for a total of $47 068; $20,530 for FY 1964 and $26,538 for
FY 1965. No additional funds are required for FY 1964 since
suffictent funds remain from the past approval to cover the
$20,530 required under this renewal request.

4. Intelligence Production: LIENVOY is one of the most
productive telephone tap projects in KUBARK of both FI and CE
type information. From 1 February 1963 through 15 January 1964,
this project has been the source of 309 positive. reperts, 56 of
which were not disseminated. LIENVOY-2 was the source of 16
reports, and the tap intercept program accounted for the renain-
ing 293. No customer evaluations were requested, but WH/3
evaluates the product as being valuable and covering a wide range
ef topics difficult to cover through other sources, The types of
reports originating from this Project include such matters as:

LIENVOY-2: Communist and leftist activity in Mexico
Communist publications
International congresses
Mexican political activities

LIENVOY: Communist and leftist personalities and
activities in Mexico
Travel

Soviet and Satellite Activities in Mexico
Cuban activities in Mexico and developments
in Cuba .
International conferences and delegates
Communist Chinese activities in Mexico

5. Effectiveness: In addition to the positive intelligence
production this Project is the source of valuable CE information
and operational leads. The intercept center covers 30 lines, all
of which are of interest to KUBARK and approximately one-half of
them are exclusively for KUBARK. These 30 lines include Mexican
Communist and leftist leaders, Prensa Latina, the Local Security
Service (Direccion Federal de Seguridad-DFS), 5 Lines on the Soviet
Embassy, 3 on the Cuban Embassy, 2 on the Czech‘Embassy, and since
September 1963 there have been 3 on the Yugoslav Embassy. This
center records an average of 525 recls per month, from which the
tap center monitors prepare daily summaries of significant items
gleaned fron all the lines. These daily resumes total between 100
to 150 pages per month, The tap center monitors prepare full
transcripts in Spanish for the Cuban, Yugoslav, and Soviet Eabassy
lines. The reels for the Soviet and Satellite coverage are given

Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, Yugoslav and Soviet Embassies
provide details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and
other useful CE data. Information gained from this source has
led to a successful recruitment in. the Yugoslav Babassy during

the past year.

Examples of some important non-disseminable information
obtained through LIENVOY during the past year are:

a. During May, through LIENVOY, the Station uncovered
a harrassment operation directed against the U.S. Embassy by the
use of forged routine forms to embarrass the Embassy and known

anti-~Comaunists,

b. Several contacts made by U.S. citizens with the
Cuban and Soviet Embassies, and with Mexican Communists wero
recorded, This information ig given special dissemination to the
FBI for their action. The most significant of these contacts was

that by Lee OSWALD with the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico
prior to the assassination of the late President KENNEDY. | OSWALD's

contact was cabled to Headquarters on 8 October 1963 and this
information was immediately disseminated to the appropriate ODYOKE

offices,

c. During August LIENVOY contributed support to the

REDWOOD APJUMBO opcration by providing information on contacts
between principals involved in this sensitive SR operation.

6. Problems: There have been no significant security, cover,
control, or Iiatson problems during the past year.

7. Liatson: This Project encompasses an unofficial liaison
relationship with high-level officials which
