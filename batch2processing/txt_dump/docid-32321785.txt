Case ID #: 62C-HQ-1029205 (Pending)

Title; John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act
of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The Act established the Assassination Records Review
Board (ARRB) to oversee the government's production and
compliance with the Act. The ARRB reviews the proposed
postponements in documents sent by each agency to the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and decides what
postponements the Act will allow or opens the document in full.
The ARRB’s responsibilities include having agencies search other

O subjects and areas to find additional material not already
identified AS’ assassination records. The establishment of the
ARRB by the Act also limited the time for their duties to be
accomplished. The ARRB must complete their tasks by September
1998. With’this deadline in mind, the ARRB sent a letter

requesting additional information. Vie HO 124 25> Wud

Enclosures: ARRB letter 50 requesting material.

Details: On February 9, 1998, the ARRB sent a letter to the FBI
setting forth a formal request to receive and review additional
records. The ARRB’s goal is to research every possible subject
that may have a bearing on assassination theories and to assure
Congress and the American public that all was done to accomplish
the intentions of the Act.

Chicago should conduct a search for the listed items.
If Chicago is aware cf-any administrative records they may have
maintained outside the normal index system, they should include
those areas in the search. If any documents related to the
matters are found, please forward the documents to the JFK Task

Force.

assassination record must be sent to the NARA in its original
