. BRAYLENSKI said that he has never had any contact
with ANGELO BRUNO in Miami, Fla., and claimed that he only
visited Miami on an average of every two or three years.

BRAYLENSKI was questioned:as to whether or not BRUNO
had any active business association with the Plaza Gambling
Casino, but BRAYLENSKI claimed he was not personally acquainted
with this phase of BRUNO's activity. BRAYLENSKI-said he had
no information concerning BRUNO's alleged activities in the, A

cooperative by furnishing some infrmation, but it was apparent
that he was considerably reluctant to furnish details as to his
knowledge of the association between BRUNO and BEN GALLUP.

On August 28, 1959, Lt. WILLIAM BURNS of the Trenton,
N.J., Police Department said that he was acquainted with ANGELO
BRUNO's ckground and knew BRUNO to contact JOHN TeRSIMONE s ,. 5.

It should be noted here that information reported
in instant .report indicates that ANGELO BRUNO has gained
prominance as a leader in the Italian racketeers. It does
not appear, however, that he has taken over the command of
the racket activity of the organization in Philadelphia and
New Jersey, his prominance appearing to be located in Phila-
delphia and Southern New Jersey exclusively.

JOSEPH IDA, mentioned above, according to information
received in the past, resides in New Brunswick, N.J., and rules
Italian racketeers. PH 251-C on 3/3/59 reported that IDA had
gone to Italy for an extended visit two months previously.

No information has been received by the Philadelphia Division -
indicating that BRUNO has taken IDA's place in command of the
Italian racket element in this vicinity.
