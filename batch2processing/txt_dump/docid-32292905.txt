TP 92-1

TP T-3, advised SA JAMES B.O'NEIL on October ;
4, and 6, 1961, that SAM MONDELLO, JR., had bragged of bringing
cash pack out of Cuba for SANTO TRAFFICANTE at the time the.
Cuban operation was falling apart due to the CASTRO rise to
power. Source noted MONDELLO had lived in Cuba for about
three years with a prostitute and he was apparently still
residing with this prostitute in Miami. Source further
noted that he did not know the reason for MONDELLO's being
in Miami or what MONDELLO was doing, but he did describe
MONDELLO as being a strong-arm man rather than having the
finesse to direct any phase of an operation.

 

 

3. RALPHARUBIO, JR.

TP T-3, advised SA O'NEIL on October 4, and 6, .
1961, that RUBIO was operating some sort of a gambling opera- °
tion for TRAFFICANTE outside the Wnited States and he

West Indies. Source stated according to his sources,’ RUBIO

with the two alternating for a period of time, with the other
man returning to report and probably bringing proceeds. Source

operating in Aruba, RUBIO may be approached. He noted RUBIO

and FERNANDEZ ‘are receiving $1500.00 a month plus expenses

for their activities.
