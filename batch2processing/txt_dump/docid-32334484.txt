at that time. Subject said, however, he is trained in

the law (4t is believed he had some correspondence courses
in law) and believes in things being done legally. He
said he is not in favor cof violence by either side to a
disagreement because that is not justified, so he is not in
favor of that espect of the recent activity of some Kian
menbers.

Subject said there was only one person who ever
spoke to him about organizing the Klan in the area, and he
could not think of that person’s name. He said that poraon
lived in the Palm Springs area of Lake Worth, Florida, and
worked for the Plorida Power and Light Company, but he had
net seen him recently and did not believe he ever took any
additional steps to organize the Klan in the area. He said he
would try to remember that name and would mako inquiries
eoncerning the possibility of Kien. activity in the area or
any activity not designed to operate without violence and
advise. It is acted former MM 666-2 works Zor Florida Power
and Light, and used to live in the Palm Springs area, but has
not lived there for almost two years.

Subject said he has been very busy handling his
contract to truck mail for the Fost Office. He said his
trucks have recently taken on a greater load since the use
of the railroad by the Post Office has been curtailed so
that koeps him too busy to do anything else.

Inquiry at the Paim Beach County, Fioride, Motor
Vehicle Registry revealed the subject still han registered
to him the 1956 Buick sedan and the 1963 Oldsmobile sedan
described in previous commnications. The Buick now bears
1965 Florida license 67-29856 and the Oldsmobile, 1965
Florida license 6-15263. Subject said he now has 6 trucks
he uses in his mail contract job.

In view of the above, along with the fact that no
activity on the part of subject in racial matters hos come
to the attention of Hiami sinco submission of last
on subject, it is not believed a summary report is justified
at this time.

Subject will be recontacted concerning his state-
. ment that he would make inquiries regarding any Kian or similar
* activity in the aren and necessary action taken on any
information furnished by hin.
