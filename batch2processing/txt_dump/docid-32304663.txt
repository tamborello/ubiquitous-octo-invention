"The file also shows that, although Mr. PINDILLI
never married, he lived with a woman out of wedlock from
1910 to 1927, and as a result, six children were born to
them in this country, His alleged wife was ordered de-
ported on July 16, 1930, also on a narcoties charge.

"On November 20, 1947, Mr. PINDILLI was deported
to Italy on the SS'Marine Percht, He submitsed to this
office an application for permission to reapply for ad-
migsion into the United States after deportation. This

application was denied on July 14, 1960,

"With reference to your request for copies of
the pertinent decisions, regulations make copies avail-.
able on a loan basis to the Attorney of Record only during
the: pendency of the proceedings,

"We trust that.this is a satisfactory response
to your inquiry,"

7 _ The effort on the part of the National Catholic Welfare
Conference, Washington, D. €., on behalf of PINDILLI, A5-223-148,
for an application of re-admission for PINDILLI.was turned down
at this point by INS, exercising their semi-judiciary powers.

HILL advised that the complete file on PINDILLI is
maintained in. Cleveland, Ohio, and would no longer be located

at St, Paul, Minnesota, where it had been located at one time.

It is felt by the Cleveland Division that PINDILLI,
who is new.77 years of age, would no longer be a threat to law
enforcement in the United States and especially since he is in
declining health and could be controlled by, cV 3M4ec,

It is also felt that .if arrangements could. be made
discreetly through Bureau liaison with the State Department
and/or INS at Washington, D, Ci, for the re-entry of PINDILLI
into the United States on a visitor's visa, specific information
as to the present structure of the La Cosa Nostra can be obtained,
Additionally, it should be noted that cv 3444c¢ stated that his
father would unquestionably be able to determine details con-
cerning such items as the GAVALLARO killing, the killing of the
NAPLES brothers in Youngstown, and the VINCE DE NIRO killing

which are apparently all related, He noted that PINDILLI woulda
not divulge this information to anyone but he (CV 344-0) could
obtain and relay whatever information PINDILLI obtained to this
Bureau. 7

a problem while in the United States on a visitor's visa, but. |
should this occur his visa could be cancelled and he could then
be returned to Argentina, If excellent intelligence information
is forthcoming due to his presence in the United States, it is
felt that. the temporary visitor's-visa could then be extended

to take full advantage of his position in the "organization,"

It is also believed unlikely that PINDILLI would become : hos

!

It is requested that the Bureau through liaison with
the State Department, the Department of Justice (Anti-Racketeering
Section) and/or INS at Washington, D, C., ascertain how a visa
may be obtained for PINDILLI. :

information furnished by CV 344-c reflected in Cleveland

airtel to the Bureau, dated January 17, 1964, is being paraphrased
and disseminated to other interested divisions, i
