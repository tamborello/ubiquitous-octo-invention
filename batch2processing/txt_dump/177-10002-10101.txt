Burma

 

 

 

 

a. Ne Win has followed up his
action in breaking off talks with
the Burmese Communists by arresting
over 700 of their number.

.b. Ne Win had been trying to
lure the faction-ridden Communists
into a "national front." However,
he found the demands of the Commu-
nist negotiators, some of whom had
only just returned from long exile
in Beiping, to be impossible.

ce. This will probably lead to
renewed fighting between the army
and Communist guerrillas in the hills.

d. More trouble can also be
expected from the rebellious ethnic
minorities like the Karens and the

c.
there are some Indians who have
‘ doubts about the Soviet willingness
to live up to the letter of their
military aid agreements with New
Delhi,

d. As is usual in these cases,
the villagers began to trickle back
- once the Viet Cong left.

e. This episode aside, we see
“a number of indications that the
Communists will try to sustain the
higher level of military activity
“they have kept up since the coup.

£. The Communist radio has
called for more attacks in an effort
to destroy strategic hamlets and
"develop" Viet Cong forces.

Ll.

Venezuela

a. The country's six presiden-
tial candidates have swung into the
home stretch of their campaigns.

So have the terrorists, who are still
trying hard to sabotage next Sunday's
vote.

b. There is little doubt that
_the terrorist effort has all-out
Cuban support. Castro looks on
Venezuela as his prime target in
Latin America and would ‘do everything
in his power to prevent President
Betancourt from finishing his term.

ec. So far, the terrorists have
tried to intimidate the candidates .
by harassing political rallies, bomb-
ing their party headquarters in
various cities, and threatening them
with assassination. They have tried
to scare voters from the polls by
creating a general atmosphere of law-
lessness. Kidnappings, like the one
yesterday morning of Colonel Chenault,
are part of the pattern,

d. The government counterattack
is under the personal direction of
Betancourt, who is as determined to
finish out his term and turn over

- power to a freely-elected successor
as Castro is to prevent this.

‘South Vietnam

e, Yesterday it was announced
that the carrying of firearms by
anyone outside the security forces
was forbidden until the elections

are over,

f. Some 3,000 reservists have
been called up to protect the polls.
Leaves are being cancelled and all
security forces are maintaining a
high state of alert.

a, We now have a fuller ac-

 

count
the Viet Cong attack on two mountain

villages

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

b. This account makes it clear
that the earlier press versions,

‘which spoke of 1,000 missing vil-

lagers, were highly colored,

: ¢e. Our present information
is that the attack, in company
strength, was successfully repulsed.
The Viet Cong suffered some 30 cas-~
ualties; government Losses were six
killed, three wounded and 39 missing.
