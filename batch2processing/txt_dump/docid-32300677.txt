vidual on the telephone and told this individual that
he would give him "the book" for all types of bets,

then I believe you will." It was rumored that this
person thought it over and thereafter took the booking
action. The unknown individual called at the time
is still not known. °

In a recent conversation with ANTHONY
"WHITEY" BESASE, LCN member from Toledo, Ohio,
BESASE stated that TONY DELSANTER, Warren, Ohio,
is a member of the "Cleveland family." BESASE
also indicated that he has been in frequent con-
tact, of late, with KELLY MANNARINO and TONY RIPEPI,
Pittsburgh members of La Cosa Nostra; however, in-
formant was unable to ascertain the purpose of these
contacts. :

On February 18, 1966, PG T-1 advised:

a Recently, SAM MANNARINO stated that while
he was incarcerated at United. States Penitentiary,
Lewisburg, Pa., from mid-1964 to mid-1965, a building
contractor named (FNU) DALEY had cheated him out of
a substantial amount of money. According to MANNARINO,
his brother, KELLY MANNARINO, and "some friends" had
come to him, upon his release, and suggested the killing

‘of DALEY, but MANNARINO claimed he disuaded them from

this course of action, saying that the risk involvd
was too great for the smfil amount of money he had lost.
