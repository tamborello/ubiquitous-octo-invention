Synopsis: LA ROCCA has remained in the Pittsburgh-Ingomar,
Pa., vicinity since his return from Bel Aire, Fla., during
early April, 1964. Neighbors have observed him daily, wandering
around extensive property and bicycle-riding in apparent
; effort to lose weight. Bel Aire residence has been closed,
i but Johnstown, Pa., racketeer,. JOSEPH REGINO, continues to
i live several doors away on semi-permanent basis. Informants
' have observed LA ROCCA in downtown Pittsburgh area simply
"putting in an appearance" and keeping in touch with his
various interests. Recent information relating to associates-
engaged in racketeering activities and other acquaintances
in the Miami area reviewed. Data pertaining to the identities
of Pittsburgh "family" members provided by informant, who
acknowledges that LA ROCCA is still in control of "syndicate
operations." This informant believes four families ruled
by LA ROCCA, GABRIEL MANNARINO, FRANK AMATO, and ANTONIO
RIPEPI make up the Greater Pittsburgh Area, and that chief
lieutenants in these families are MIKE GENOVESE, THOMAS
CIANCUTTI, JOSEPH SICA, and JOHN BAZZANO, respectively.
Other matters concerning personal history, illegal activities
and legitimate enterprises set forth. IN VIEW OF THE CON-
VICTION OF LA ROCCA FOR ASSAULT WITH INT i Is
ARR IR R NCE. ’ B io

PG T-1. has. advised that LA ROCCA has continued to°
remain in the Pittsburgh-Ingomar, Pa., area and has not var
“returned to Florida since his return home during the second... -:

The aforementioned informant.,: has heard rumors

to the effect that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at 4.

.; Pittsburgh is again endeavoring to "make a big case" involving’ .°
LA ROCCA but cannot bring it to court until more expenditures

are uncovered. He said LA ROCCA*knows this, and his former

daughter-in-law has been instructed by him not to talk to .

Federal investigators. He seems to be jockeying with his . .
