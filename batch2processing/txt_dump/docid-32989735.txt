the following identified agents:

UFAC - Robbery First - Case Agents

Chicago, Illinois SA Robert F. Pevahouse

St. Louis, SA Cletis B. Bidewell
Missouri

To analyze the question of indirect FBI involve-—
ment through informants, it is requested that the FBI
advise whether the enclosed lists of persons contain -
the names of any FBI informant, operative or source.

In the event of an affirmative response, it is requested
that the FBI provide the House Select Committee on Ass-—
assinations with the number of informants, operatives or
sources in each of the three lists and make an attempt to
ascertain whether any such individuals would consent to
an interview by the Committee. It is also requested that
the files on any such individual be prepared for review
by myself personally. The enclosed lists represent an
effort to establish priorities in what is recognized to
be a consuming process on the part of the FBI. It is re-
quested however that this review be completed by August

15, 1978.

Very truly yours,

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch .
Deputy Assistant Attorney General
Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Pursuant to the mandate under which the House
Select Committee on Assassinations operates, it is
incumbent upon us to ascertain not only the individual”. -
culpability of those individuals possibly involved ing .7.
the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but i
also the direct or indirect responsibility of any organi-
zations so involved. Inasmuch as this portion of our
mandate does not differentiate between governmental and
non-governmental entities, the FBI is one of those
organizations whose possible complicity in the assassi-
nation of Dr. King must be examined. Such an examination
must proceed on some fundamental assumptions: if James
Earl Ray killed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the FBI
were involved then such involvement could have been effec-—
tuated only by direct FBI agent contact with James Earl
Ray or through indirect contact by means of an FBI operative,
informant or individual with ey the FBI had S.  PIn wee

of source relationship. 4h , Qe “H19 & > oe Sao we

In order to analyze the question of ceibne #28 ct
contact it will be necessary to interview certain FBI. =e wom
agents who either were stationed at the office serving
Missouri State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri
during 1960-1967 or were involved in the unlawful flight

(i . investigation of James Earl Ray prior to the death of
: "Dr. King.

For the information of the Bureau, there ard nb
main case files on RAY. All references to RAY were located
in the PINAP file of Minneapolis which pertains to the
kidnapping of Mrs. VIRGINIA PIPER in 1972. The references
generally relate to RAY and are contained in serials wherein
he was afforded a polygraph exam, and daily summary
teletypes wherein the test was discussed and general
serials where he is considered a possible suspect.

One reference to RAY was not in its file and
one volume containing a particular serial was not located.

Since Minneapolis is not aware of what the HCSA

It is noted that RAY is referred to by his
