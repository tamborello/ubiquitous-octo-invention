background before the revolution, maybe because he was so young, but

’ He went through the Department df Constructions of ,the Ministry of |
Education at the same time that he was a militiaman in Remedios, where
.he was known on account of doing more than what was required of him.
Later he was transferred to the State Security Department (G-2), which
was no secret to anyone because of the way heteiiaved. From time to
time he was gone from the city of Remedios, a thing that didn't amaze -

His aunt, Lucia LOPEZ MARRIED TO MR. WILFREDO RUISSCH, a former , .

- shoemaker in Camhjuani, head-town of the municipality next to Remedios;
this couple live on the Andres Cuevas St. #54 at the mentioned tgywn

, of Camajuani, L.V. Now this Ruissch is in charge of tha Trust of"Leather

*. which takes care 6f the distribution of Unit #402 of the Shoemakers of
Camajuani; she (Lucia Lopez), upon a visit to the dentist, whom I have
known for many years as a responsible and serious person, she expressed’

herself in the following MANNEL 3 - newer ee ew emam ame So laheteneteteleiaterateted
"My nephew "Miguelito", has just arrived from the U.S., he was in,Dallas
Texas, on the day of the assassination of Kennedy, but he managed’ to

_ leave through the frontier of Laredo; abready in Mexico a FAR plarie.
brought him to Cubaf she continued to say, "you know that he is one
of Raul's men (referring to Raul Castro); Miguelito is very brave,
very brave!"

The informant, dentist of the mentioned aunt, says he knows the so callec
Miguelito, he is five feet ten inches tall ¢5*-10"), dark, strong °
complexion, dark brown hair, brown eyes, crazy about Castro, He had
firing practice while in the militias and the doctor considers this

man capable of doing anything.

Immediately I called two of my-:best men in Camajuani, one of them a
shoemaker who knows Wilfredo Russch very well and I gave him instructions
on this matter, but I didn't tell them too much of what I knew; the

' xvesults, according to what they just informed me confirms what was —
stated in such a way that only this remains to be said:

'™.C.S. was a poor person, poorly dressed, and after he was missing
from Remedios for several weeks but this was not strange due to his
condition of militiaman and indoctrinated revolutionary, but now he
‘dresses well, has a lot of money, owns large amounts of T-shirts,
jackets and shoes, all American made. The rumars, are that he has given
some pairs of shoes to some of his friends. "They were in a bar near
him and were able to observe that the shoes they were wearing were
American made". : :

It seems that he departed from Dallas Texas with two friends, and the
Dentist believes he is following the tracks of one of them. If I have
had any means of transmitting this message, you would have known about
it at least ten days ago, but we have no other means to do it.
