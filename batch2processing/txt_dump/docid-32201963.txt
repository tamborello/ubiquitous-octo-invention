agency which conducts intelligence-type investigations,
' furnished informaticn aa follows:

_ Sometime in June of 1662, (FNU) JIMENEZ, Cuban
Anbasgador to Panama during the rdministration. of GRAY
SAN MARTIN, said he was planning to assassinate Presiden”
ROBERTO F. CHIARI of Panama. JIMENEZ kad been trying, for

_. the last six months, to recruit Cubans in the Mand area
* . for- work | ‘in Panama. . ‘ .

About fifteen days before (in guly of 1962),

_ JIMENEZ spent some three cays each in Miami, Puerto Rico
-- and New York. In Miami, JIMENEZ was in touch with SERGIO
CASTRO and Captain (Ea) RODRIGUEZ DIAZ, both well known
gunmen, and gave them $500.00 as an initial payment for
the assasgzination of the President of Panama. The assassination

was to take place during an uprising in Panama, JIMENEZ said,
and one of the important figures ia the uprising would
‘be ROBERTO ARIAS GUARDIA.

"MM T-1 advised further that ROBERTO ARIAS was
reportedly ready to assist in the ingurrectionary attempt
of Major MANUEL HURTADO SEDA of the National Guard, and a
mall group of guardamen who supported him in Panama in

. August of 1962.

in Panama, This is teing done with the cooperation of the

present Panaranian Government. JIMENEZ owns several race
horses, and sometize in the past was prohibited from racing

Hotel. He remained in Miami for several days, and then
