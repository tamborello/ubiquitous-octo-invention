have risked making witting a mmber of easployees who vere previously
unvitting and, 1 our esticate, would have added little to the details
available fran those dixectly involved. ‘here are incorsistencles
among the various accounts, but most of thes can be resolved by :
collating the information furnicked by all of the identifiable
yarticfpants in a particular plen and by then checking it against
specific dates’that can be fixed with fair certainty. We believe
that this reconstruction of what happened and of the thinking
associated vith it is reasounbly sound. If there are significant -
inaccuracies in the report, they are most Likely to occur in faulty
omering of the sequence of events. People still remember puch of
what herpesed, tut they can no longer recall precisely voen. ~

MEMORANDUM

This reconstruction of Agency involvezent in plans wo
assassinate Fidel Castro is at best an imperfect Bistory. Because.
of the extrexe sensitivity of the operations teing discussed or
attezpted, as a matter of principle no official records were kept
of vlanning, of approvals, or of tmplanentatton. Tae fev uritten
records that do exist arc either largely tangestial to to tue main
events or were put on paper fran memory years afterward. dillian
Marvey has retaized skeletal notes of his activities duricg the
years in question, and they are our best source of dates. Dr.
Edvard Gun, of the Office of. Medical. Services, has a record of
whes he met end when and eryptic references to the subjects discussed.

[__s—s—~*=édi Of SD, as a record of tuo or, three dates ‘hat ere

critical tise fren¢s. Operational, files are useful. in some instances,
because they give dates of meetings, the substances of which pay be

For the most part, though, ve have had to rely oa Snformation
