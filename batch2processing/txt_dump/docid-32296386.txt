captioned as above.

. As indicated in rePHlet, subject died 3/16/63,
Pennsylvania Hospital, Phila., Pa., and was buried
3/20/63 Holy Cross Cemetery, Yeadon, Delaware County, Pa.

On 5/9/63 PH 599-C-TE advised in his opinion
FRANK SANSONE was not a member of La Cosa Nostra and
due to his reputation it was doubtful that he ever would
have become a member. .

On 2/10/64 PH 672-C-TE advised to his knowledge
FRANK SANSONE was never a member of La Cosa Nostra.

Continuous contacts with PH 591-C* and PH
623-C* over the past several years have failed to
indicate that captioned individual was a member of the
Philadelphia Family of La Cosa Nostra.

Since this subject is dead, this case is placed
in a closed status. If information is developed in the
future that he was a member of La Cosa Nostra, it will

be reopened to verify same.
