Information has been received from NY 3936-C concerning a 3.—
$500,000 loan allegedly obtained by Rock Hill Lodge, Inc., (Rock Hill)
through one Stewart Ogilvie, reportedly an official of a banking in-
stitution in Washington, D. C., and that Ogilvie allegedly received a
fee for approving this loan, It was reported that Ogilvie is a contact
of John Gleason, son of Teddy Gleason, President, International Long-
shoremen's Association (ILA), who controls 50 percent of; ILA Welfare
Fund (WF) premiums through GBM Brokerage Corporation, New York City,
which is operated by John Gleason and his brother, Thomas . \

According to the source, John Gleason. deposited substantial ~ 4
amounts of the ILA premiums in the banking institution with which ‘
Ogilvie is associated, thereby enabling Gleason to obtain loans through
Ogilvie, who reportedly received a commission on each loan approved,

It is the source's understanding that some time in the past

a team of auditors or bank examiners reviewed loans of this Washington
banking institution and found that the loans issued by Ogilvie were
not in accordance with good practice. Reportedly, Ogilvie was sub-
sequently discharged from his position at the bank and the bank, all
pressed : for payment on its loan to Rock Hill.
