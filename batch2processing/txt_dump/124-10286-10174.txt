The Washington Field Office is requested to contact
the Passport Division, U. S. Department of State, to determine
the status of the subject's passport application.

 

n

Since the possibility exists that the subject may be
going to Israel for other purposes than to accompany her father
and since these other purposes may be quite significant in deter-
mining the scope of her Chinese Communist activities, the Bureau is
requested to consider contacting the U. S. Department of State so
that the subject may recei sport.yptler activities in
Israel may then be covered

It is to be noted that Israel maintains diplomatic
relations with Peking, andit w d be quite significant if the
subject contacted the Chinese Sip lomatic establishment in Israel. (ey
