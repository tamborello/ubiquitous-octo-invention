V. GENERAL ACTIVITIES, TAMPA, FLORIDA

Continued spot checks of the subject's residence,
2505 Bristol, Tampa, as well as spot checks of Columbia
Restaurant and the residences of subject's mother and brothers,.:
Tampa, have failed to disclose subject's presence in Tampa. :

On August 9, 1961, JAMES COSTA LONGO and FRANK
TRAFFICANTE, brother of the subject, were observed at the
Columbia Restaurant, Tampa. They were accompanied by a third
person believed to be the subject. Positive identification
was not possible, however, as this group proceeded to the back.
oom of the Columbia Restaurant.

 

The newspaper "Tampa Times'', Tampa, Florida, reported .
on August 9, 1961, that FRANK TRAFFICANTE was fined $15.00
in Tampa Traffic Court on charge of careless driving in an
accident.

TP T-Z advised on August 8, 1961, that JAMES COSTA
LONGO and CASEY HERNANDEZ, part owner of the Columbia Restaurant,
have been spending a great deal of time at the office of Great
Southern Construction Company on East Hillsboro Avenue, Tampa. «- -
The current Tampa City Directory lists CASIMERO HERNANDEZ as
president, Great Southern Construction Company.

i T-2 was of the opinion that subject might well be
spending time at the same location since LONGO is often with
the subject when he is in town.

TP T-3 advised on July 25, 1961, that CESAR RODRIGUEZ
and GEORGE MICKEY GREEN, both of Tampa, were told to be -
available about one o'clock, Saturday, July 15, 1961, on the
possibility they would have a job to do. T-3 advised he re#*
ceived information that approximately: a year ago aznman in
Havana, Cuba, had liquidated subject's assets there after ~
CASTRO came into power and was then supposed to return all of *.
the money received from this liquidation to the United States,
instead the man stayed in Cuba and did not send any of the
money to the subject. TRAFFICANTE and his group, according to
T-3, have been trying ever since then to get the man out of
Cuba and were successful, probably Friday, July 14th. T-3
advised he was not certain of this. T-3 related that he learned

On 7/21/61, SA JOHN R. BRETT was in the office of
USA EDWARD F. BOARDMAN in Tampa, Fla., reviewing FGJ records ©
in another matter. Mr. BOARDMAN had three visitors, identified
as GENE MITCHELL, Dr. (FNU) RULE, and a white female, "SCOTTY"
(LNU). . . .

All. advised Mr. BOARDMAN that they were there in
the interests of good government dnd for the best interests
of the country and not for political reasons. "SCOTTY" (LNU) *
related that in 1954 when WILLIAM C, CRAMER was running for
Congress, she was approached by one PAUL DE PETRIE, who told
her that a friend of his, SANTO TRAFFICANTE, was. at that time
in court on some matter and wanted CRAMER's help, and DE PETRIE
wanted to know if she could arrange a contact with CRAMER so
that he might. make a substantial contribution to CRAMER's
campaign fund but with the understanding that there would begp .
strings attached to the contribution,

"SCOTTY" contacted GENE MITCHELL, who was then
campaign manager for CRAMER, and MITCHELL told her that he
did not want any part of the deal.

MITCHELL then took up the story, stating that as
campaign manager he received so many calls that he did not
make a record of all of them and did not. take action on all

he would be willing to furnish the information he has
concerning CRAMER although he qualified this by stating that
two-thirds of his information was strictly hearsay.

Mr. BOARDMAN advised all three of his visitors that ...
he was not interested in political activities in any way, that
he was bound by the Hatch Act and was not going to take part
in any political activities. Mr. BOARDMAN instructed his
visitors to submit any complaint or information they might
have to him in writing and he would then consider whatever
action he might be able to take after receipt of their complaint.

, He pointed out tht he normally did not do any investigation
in his‘office, only prosecution, but stated he could request
investigation, and if a criminal action was brought to his

I, attention, hé could do that. He stated, however, he would |

: not take any further action on their information until he had

i received something in writing from them, and he declined to

i listen to any further information they might furnish in the
