SEGRET “20 August 1978

SUBJECT: Response to HiSCA Request of 25 July 1978

1. A thorough review of Agency files containing
production from the LILYRIC photographic surveil-
lance operation in Mexico City reveals the exis-
tance of no LILYRIC logs or production carlier
than 3 April 1967, It appears that earlier
photographs may have becn destroyed in a purge of
Mexico City Station files and that the folders
for the destroyed material were re-used to for-
ward more recent photographic material to Head-
quarters for retention.

2. According to a blind nemorandum dated 2 May
1977, subject: i of Mexico City Station

Files at the [Records Center, the LILYRIC
folder which wou contained photographs and
logs for the period 23 July through 30 November
1963 had been re-used to store LICALLA photographs
and logs for the period 2 May through 30 June 1967.
{Cf. Blind memorancun dated 5 Nay 1977, subject:
Photograph Records of the “Unidentified Man" Who
Was in Mexico City during October 1963.]

3. The above information is contained in a soft

dual in Mexico City. This folder has been reviewed
