JACOBSON's remarks again concern the fact that

a surreptitious meeting between D'ARCO and GIANCANA was

interrupted by Chicago Agents during the mid-afternoon

of 11/29/62, It is noted that a very brief and vague

mention indicating that somebody from the First Ward

Organization was intending to meet with GIANCANA during

the afternoon of 11/29/62, was furnished during the late

morning of 11/29/62, by CG 6576-C*, Due to the fact

that CG 6498-PCI had very recently advised that he met

with GIANCANA at the Czech Lodge in North Riverside, ;
Illinois, it was felt by Chicago Agents that possibly . '
the meeting between the representative of the First :
Ward and GIANCANA would also take place there, it being

noted that this PCI“is appolitician, Based on this

information, SAs RALPH R, HILL, WILLIAM F, ROEMER, and

MARSHALL E, RUTLAND proceeded to the Czech Lodge at

approximately 1:00 p.m. on 11/29/62, and observed a

car known to be frequently utilized by GIANCANA in the :
parking lot of the restaurant. Feeling that little i
_could be lost in the way of jeopardizing either |
CG 6576-C* or CG 6498-PEI, the Agents decided that :
more could be gained by physically interrupting the
' conference of GIANCANA with the representative of the
i First Ward meeting with him, When the Agents first went i
into the restaurant, they were unable to locate GIANCANA ;
and his conferee but later from information furnished by i
the bartender there, SA ROEMER determined that they were
meeting in a private dining space, He, therefore, went
into the private area, greeted GIANCANA with reference

to his nickname "MOE" and shook hands with D'ARCO, it
being noted that D'ARCO has been interviewed on several
occasions by SA ROEMER, It is noted that D'’ARCO pretended
