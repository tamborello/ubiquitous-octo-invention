In 1934, LEONARD PATRICK was at a crap game
operated by POLSKY and CRATISH, and PATRICK told POLSKY
that he wanted a cut from this game. An argument followed,

_ and PATRICK seized a broken milk bottle and thrusted the

jagged edge into the face of one of POLSKY's men and cut
him badly. POLSKY then said that he would get even with
PATRICK for this incident. Sometime later, POLSKY, CRATISH
and ZUCKIE ZUKERMAN were machine gunned to death, reportedly
for robbing handbooks; however, it was generally known in
the neighborhood, that LEONARD PATRICK was responsible

for these killings due to his feud with POLSKY,

According to CG T-14, sometime later, JAMES
RAGEN, a racing wire service operator, was slain.
According to the newspapers and the opinion of others in
the 24th Ward, it was strongly suspected that LEONARD PATRICK
and DAVE YARAS were responsible for this killing.

In October, 1947, Captain CONNELLY and
Lieutenant DRURY, suspended police officers, stated that
it was alleged that the same persons, PATRICK, BLOCK and
YARAS, were responsible for the shooting of "BUGSY SIEGEL",
a West Coast racketeer with reported connections in the
alleged Chicago crime "syndicate", because of the modus
operandi used in the shooting of SIEGEL, SIEGEL was in
the California residence of VIRGINIA HILL, a girlfriend
of his.

On September 10, 1948, LEONARD PATRICK was ;
interviewed in connection with an investigation by the Chicago
Office at which time he stated that he resided at 4248
West Congress Street, Chicago, and that he, with his brother,
JACK PATRICK, operated the Lawndale Restaurant at 3714
West Roosevelt Road.

Regarding recent gangland killings in the Chicago
area, specifically those of NORTON POLSKY, 1865 South
Springfield Avenue, "LITTLE SNEEZE" FRIEDMAN, Midwest
Athletic Club, and HARRY "The Horse" KROTISH, 1500 block
of South St. Louis Avenue, PATRICK stated that in his
opinion, all three of these individuals had been killed
because, he heard, they were engaged in robberies of handbooks
and gambling houses, He stated that none of their activities
took place in the Roosevelt Road area. He stated he considered
himself a close personal friend of all of the above individuals,
however, he disclaimed any definite knowledge as to what
their activities were prior to the time they were killed.

CG 92-374:

On March 10, 1958, CG T~24 advised that a
WILLIAM DRURY, former Chicago Police Lieutenant, who
was killed in gangland style on September 22, 1952, was
a client of CG T-24. Again CG T=-24 stated LEONARD PATRICK
was one of the individuals responsible for DRURY's murder.

In a "Daily News" article dated January 5,
1953, concerning the slaying of MILTON GLICKMAN whose
body was found in the trunk of his car on January 14,
1953, it was stated that the police were seeking LEONARD
PATRICK, reputed "syndicate" boss of the West Side for
questioning concerning the slaying. PATRICK was sought
because of an unlisted telephone number of a man described
as PATRICK's first lieutenant, one HERSHEY (HARRY) KOVIN,
was found on GLICKMAN's body.

During November, 1955, CG T-13 advised that
LENNY PATRICK and DAVE YARAS were hired gunmen and killers
for the Chicago underworld group.

Miscellaneous

On December 10, 1958, CG T-16 advised that
LENNY PATRICK controls the gambling for the Chicago mob
in the West Roosevelt Road area and was not in the good
graces of other Chicago hoodlums, According to CG T-16,
the reason for this is that PATRICK has been muscling in
on legitimate businessmen and bringing heat on the Chicago
mob thereby.

The Chicago Crime Commission reported in a
memorandum of March 26, 1947, information reflecting that:
DAVID YARAS and LENNY PATRICK, sought by the police, might .
be in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the company of a LARRY DOYLE,
a Twin-Cities hoodlum. It was learned that both these persons
had been with DOYLE at his place of business but had left
before Chicago police authorities reached town to apprehend
' them,

Prostitution

- .,On June 24, 1957, CG T-23 was contacted by SA
THOMAS W, PARRISH and advised that the underworld group had
controlled the complete operations of the call system run by
D. WHEELER and herself, She stated that they had forced them
into obtaining more and more girls for prostitution. She
stated that LENNY PATRICK visited them on various occasions
demanding that they expand their operation or they would get
into serious trouble. CG T-23 stated her last contact with
PATRICK was in 1953,

She stated that when she and WHEELER were arrested
by the FBI, PATRICK threatened to kidnap and kill her son
if she revealed any information regarding the operations of
the call business, She further advised that on one occasion,
PATRICK told her she would get the same treatment that he
had given GROSS if she gave him any trouble. CG T-23 stated
that GROSS was a Chicago politician who was killed in gang-
land manner approximately five years ago.

CG T-23 advised that PATRICK is very friendly with
(FNU) NOODLEMAN who formerly ran a currency exchange on
Rush Street and handled a considerable amount of racketeer
money. She stated that when she and WHEELER were operating,
they deposited all the checks through NOODLEMAN, (IRVING NUDLEMAN)

Suspect in Gangland Slayings

It was reported to the Chicago Office in 1946,
exact date unknown, by an unknown source, that DAVE YARAS °
and LEONARD PATRICK are reported to be the "torpedoes" or the
killers for the "syndicate",

It was reported to the Chicago Office in 1946,
exact date unknown, by an unknown source, that PATRICK
may have had a part in the killing of WILLIE TARSCH and
"ZUKIE the Bookie" ZUCKERMAN, West Roosevelt Road gamblers
who were killed in gangland style several years ago by
unknown persons,

III, ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES
Gambling

CG T-18 advised on October 9, 1961, that a bookie
named BEN CUTLER is operating his books mostly in Cicero,
Illinois, at the present time. He said, however, that CUTLER
continues to operate to some degree in the vicinity of
Ogden and Kedzie Avenues in Chicago. According to CG T-19
LENNY PATRICK obtainss50 per cent of CUTLER's income from
operations.

CG T-18 advised on October 27, 1961, that he has
known LENNY PATRICK for many years as the gambling boss
in Chicago's 24th Ward and PATRICK obtains a 50 per cent
interest of all proceeds from gambling activity in this
Ward. He said PATRICK's 24th Ward headquarters are in the
Douglas Park Hotel in about the 3600 block of West Roosevelt
Road, Chicago, and his office is directly behind the hotel
desk. CG T-18 also advised that LENNY PATRICK's brother
JACK PATRICK is at the hotel more than LENNY. :

CG T -18 further advised that LENNY PATRICK
approached him about two months ago and wanted him to open
a bookie operation. PATRICK advised him this would be a
fifty-fifty deal with any police payoffs coming out of the
informant's 50 per cent. The informant stated that he {
turned PATRICK down on this deal.

CG T-19 advised recently that he had received information
that LEONARD PATRICK had recently become involved in an .
argument with one LOUIS CIRIONA over the operation of a
horse book on the north side of Chicap. CG T-19 stated that
CIRIONA is a runner for LOUIS BRIATTA who controls bookmaking
activities in Chicago's Loop area. BRIATTA is directly
answerable to Chicago hoodlums GUS ALEX and FRANK FERRARO,
Informant was of the opinion that the argument was due to the
fact that CIRIONA had been given authority to operate a horse
book in a particular area by SAM GIANCANA. This fact was
discovered by PATRICK who attempted to disuade CIRIONA from
operating. Failing to do so PATRICK reportedly went to
GUS ALEX in an effort to settle the dispute.

CG T-10 stated that these "district men" are required to
pay a certain sum of money each month to GIANCANA, who in turn,
turns over a certain sum to ACCARDO, The district men are allowed
rather wide latitude in the means they exercise to raise this
money and any money they make in excess of the amount payable to
GIANCANA may be counted as their profit. The informant pointed out
these payments must be made promptly and in cash and failure to meet
these obligations are generally deemed to be a fatal mistake,

This informant pointed out that the principal thing that
the "syndicate" has to sell is protection. For example, protection
from police action and protection from other hoodlums., The
informant noted the fact that gambling is protected from police
action and this inevitably gives rise to other criminal activity
such as prostitution, narcotics, and fencing. The informant pointed
out that if the police are compromised in one activity there is a

_certain reluctance to act in another direction. The informant

HW 45904

stated that the district man is under considerable compulsion to
raise a certain amount of money each month, and if gambling revenues
are uncertain or inadequate he will turn to any means available.

On February 25, 1958, CG T-11 advised SA RAYMOND J.
DRISCOLL, in answer to the question as to the existence and identity

of a "syndicate", was most emphatic that a "syndicate" exists and total

members might number as high as twenty-five. CG T-11 doubted that
there was anyone man in charge, He explained that certain men in
various levels of power exist in certain areas of Chicago. For
example, LENNY PATRICK and DAVE YARAS of Jewish parentage control .
the Roosevelt Avenue area, and their headquarters is at Roosevelt
and Independence Boulevard. .

Gambling
Bookmaking

On February 26, 1958, CG T~12 advised SA HAROLD D. SELL
that he worked for LENNY PATRICK as an operator in a 50-50 book in
1948 and 1949, This book was operated in a barber shop at 330 West
Roosevelt and his payments were made to LENNY PATRICK at the New
Lawndale Restaurant in that neighborhood. CG T-12 states that at
that time PATRICK was in control of the New Lawndale Restaurant and
there was a full-scale hard card book being operated there.
According to CG T-12, PATRICK had the area from Kedzie to Cicero and
from Madison south to approximately 18th Street, No one could open
a book or take on any bets unless he had the OK of PATRICK. At
that time PATRICK's lieutenants were YARAS and BLOCK,

was a gambling room in the rear of this building which had an
entrance near 944 Eastwood Avenue. It was a big "pan" and poker
game mainly piayed by the “Jewish boys". He stated that he saw
several people driving big Cadillacs go into this gambling room,
but he did not know who they were. He stated this room did not
have a liquor bar, but did have a little snack or sandwich bar.
He stated that to the best of his knowledge, this game was :
"wide open",

On March 18, 1958, CG T-15 advised tiiat the gambling
joint at 948 West Eastwood is owned by MAX NEEDLER (phonetic),
and is controlled by the "outfit". CG T-15 added that the owner-
ship and license of this place was in the name of BOB GRIFFIN or
GRIFFITH who worked there at one time but is no longer there now.
According to CG T-15, GRIFFIN would like to get his name off of
these records, but was afraid to do so because of the “outfit”.

CG T-16 advised on December 15, 1959, that during the-
latter part of November a friend of his was approached by HENRY
FRIEDENBERG, the owner and operator of Arcadia Press, Arcadia
Press is one of the three large distributors of football parley
cards in the Chicago area.

CG T-16 stated that the purpose of FRIEDENBERG's appreech
was to have his friend contact LENNY PATRICK. CG T-16 stated that
PATRICK was a fairly close friend of his and had been for approxi-
mtely 15 or 20 years. He said that FRIEDENBERG asked his friend
to contact PATRICK die to the fact that BILL FINKEL had recently
died. CG T-16 noted that FINKEL operated a "Jewish card room"
in the vicinity of Morse and Glenwood on the far North Side of
Chicago. in the territory controlled by LENNY PATRICK. FRIEDENBERG
asked his friend to urge PATRICK to let him, FRIEDENBERG, take
over the operation of this card room.

CG T-16 advised that as a result of FRIEDENBERG's request,
this individual met PATRICK on the night of November 23, 1959,
at the Black Angus Restaurant at 7127 North Western, Chicago.
He presented FRIEDENBERG's request to PATRICK without. recommenda-
tion and was told by PATRICK that FINKEL did not own the card
room, and that FINKEL had operated the games in the card room only
as a front for PATRICK. PATRICK told informant's friend that the
room was, in fact, owned by PATRICK and that “out of the goodness
of his heart" he was giving the widow of FINKEL $100 a month as
compensation for the loss of her husband's income.

PATRICK claimed that he already had someone else in

mind to take over this card room, and that he should tell FRIEDEN-
BERG that he was "out of luck" in this regard.
