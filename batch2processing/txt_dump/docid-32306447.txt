CUBELA reportedly is in contact with some <4
_of the original members of the old Directorio
Revolucionario in Cuba, however, the object of

this association is not known to the informant at
this time.

 

The above is not being set forth in form

suitable for dissemination in view of the delicate
; nature of informant's contact, and the fact that
the desire of CUBELA to defect was previously re-
|. ported in form suitable for dissemination.

_ 1 Miami will maintain contact with MM 761-s
i in connection with this matter, and information

pertaining thereto will be furnished the Bureau
immediately upon receipt:
