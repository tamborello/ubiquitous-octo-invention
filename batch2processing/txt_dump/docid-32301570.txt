MM T-1 advised that the exact date of the raid,
which was tentatively set for Dacember 14 or 15, 1963, has
not yet been set, but Bosch is desirous that the raid take
place some time during the week which began on December 15,
1963.: MM T-l said that the date is contingent upon Bush's
first checking out as pilot, and in the meantime,

‘dt appears that Bush is amxious to mike as much money as

possible out of this operation, refore, be

es eee practice flights aa} may._the MM T-1 said

that was scheduled, as of Sunday, December 15, 1963,

to again practice with the same Aero Commander on December 16

| 1963. MM T-l believes that on December 17, 1963,
will make a flight over Bimini, weather permitting.

MM T-1 has not yet been able to obtain the
identity of the boat or boats scheduled to be used in

this operation. However, Bosch has disclosed that he

has instructed the Cuban captain of a boat to "stand by".
Bosch has also. disclosed that a Cuban, to whom he has
referred both as "Orlando" and as "Ramirez,"' will be the
bomb expert on the raid. He has advised that this individual
constructs the bombs, end has participated in previous bomb-
ing raids for the MIRR. ‘The bombs are being. constructed
from empty oxygen tank casings, and the fittings on the top
of the casings will be used in connection with detonation ~
of the bombs. Bosch has algo disclosed that another crew
man on the bombing flight also participsted on previous
bombing flights, and is experienced in bombing matters.

Both "Orlando" and his companion have received training

‘by the United States Army, according to Bosch.

   
   
 

t is te be noted that previous investigation:
States Customs has reflected that

a@ Cuban exile, is believed to have participated
in prev Lowe bombing raids by the MIRR.

MM T-1 stated that on the basie of comments made -
by Bosch and some of his cowpanions, relating to previous —
raids and to the currently scheduled raid, he is of the

Re: Movimientc Insurrecional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria

opinion that Bosch plans to use ‘two boats on this
operation. The larger of the two, which will be 35

to 40 feet long, will leave from the Miami area on aa
ostensible fishing trip, during the early evening prior

‘to the scheduled raid. It will rendezvous with « smaller

boat which may depart from the area of Homsstead Bayfront
Park, Homestead, Florida. Laredo Rodriguez, previously
mentioned, possesses an interest in « small fara located
on or near 4 cemal in the impadiate area of Homastead
Bayfront Park. This farm has previously been utilized

in preparations for similar raids. Also, Laredo Rodriguez
possesses a 1963. Ford pickup truck, bearing 1963 Florida
license 16K4254. This truck ig a cream colored two door.
It is a "Ford 100." It is easily distinguished by the
fact that thers are old wooden alata on the sides and
back of the truck. MM Tel was of the opinion that this
truck might be used in connection with preparations for

: the raid.

On December 16, 1963, Mr. John Kinny, General
Aviation Operations Inspector, "Federal Aviation Agency,

Miami, informed that on December 14, and 15; 1963, Charles.
Bush, accompanied by another person, 4a ‘Aero “Commander H-2624B,
“made practice flights from Broward International Airport.

_ On the flight on December 14, 1963, William Johnson was

observed by Mr. Kinny in the immediate areas. of Bush's
aviation company. Johnson was particularly interested
in the flight of the Aero Commander.
