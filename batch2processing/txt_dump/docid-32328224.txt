The ldégger from LOWELL BRIDWELL stated in part, "My
interest in FRANKAQONVERSE and his operating engineers was in.
connection with @ construction industry - primarily’ highway
construction. -O ¥ ;

"In my opinion, CONVERSE has been and still is the
enforcing arm of an organization which has very strong control
of practically ‘all big construction programs in the Cleveland -
Metropolitan area, including who gets the contract, where the
contractor buys his materials, how much he pays for them, ete.

"Contractors in the Cleveland area are forced to go
along with this program on the threat of having wildcat strikes
by the operating engineers or TRISCARO's dump truck drivers.
They also are threatened with sabotage and general labor unrest.

"This organization, which is headed by ERNEST: GREEN
of Cleveland, exercises control over construction projects in
Cuyahoga County, all of Geauga County, and parts of Summit,
Medina, and Lorain Countiés...

"I first ran across this situation when specifica-
tions were switched suddenly on a project to widen and rebuild
Route 42 on the outskirts of Cleveland in connection, with. an
Ohio Turnpike Interchange.

"At the time, I think it was about 1953 or 1954, the
Columbia Southern Chemical Corporation, a Barberton, Ohio,
subsidiary of Pittsburgh Plate Glass, had an overload of mater-
ial it produces as a byproduct_.and can be used as aggragate,
interchangeably with regular limestone or slag. In this pro-
ject, specifications called for slag, but were switched to
Columbia's byproduct at an extra cost to the contractor. He .
kicked up a fuss because, this meant his profits on the job were
cut. substantially. His name is RAY SCHLOSS of the
Asphalt Paving Company.

 

"T talked with SCHLOSS from Columbus by telephone, 4
and he told.me he was so angry he was willing to tell the
whole story on how the organization operated. I immediately
drove to Cleveland, but: by the time I arrived some four hours

later, he changed his mind and refused to even talk with me."
