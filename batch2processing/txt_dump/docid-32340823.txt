LA 92-113

Referenced airtel from Las Vegas to Los Angeles dated
12/8/66, set forth that on 12/2/66, LV 203-C-TE advised SA CARL F.
/ FREEMAN that approxjmately nine months ago, informant had an

   

-— SPARACINO and infofmant. subsequently became friendly again, at
which time SPARACINO stated that following their agrument, SPARACINO
had attempted to contact JOHN ROSELLI to report the actions of
informant. The source was guestioned as to what ROSELLI could do
in a matter like this and informant stated that had SPARACINO’been
able. to contact ROSELLI, informant would have had to answer to
ROSELLI concerning any complaints that SPARACINO had against him.

2 » .
Informant was cuestioned as to why ROSELLI would have
control of him or any other Italians in Las Vegas and he stated

| that ROSELLI was a very powerful man in the Las Vegas area and

| handled a number of disputes between Italians in Las Vegas.

Informant also oointed out that had SPARACINO known or
| yeported him to FRANK DESIMONE of Los Angeles, then the informant
would have had to go before DESIMONE to straighten out the argument.

j \ Informant was very reluctant to actually state that
subject's position was connected with the LCN but implied ROSELLI
was an arbitrator for problems arising between two Italians. .

This information should be carefully paraphrased if
used in a report since it could be directly connected with the
informant if used in a report which is disseminated.

; On 8/17/66, NY 5542-C-TE (an LCN member source) advised
SAs PAUL G. DURKIN and CHARLES G. DONNELLY that he recently visited
the Flamingo Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada. While in the Candlelight
‘Room at this hotel he observed a very dapper and distinguished
looking gentleman, who made a definite impression on the informant.
He made inquiries and determined he was JOHN ROSELLI from Los
Angeles. : '

It is to be noted at this time he did not know ROSELLI
to be a member of LCN.

Subsequently, informant visited Miami and while-in
conversation. with JOHN BIELE, aka Johnny Foto (GAMBLING LCN
"family" member) mentioned he had seen ROSELLI in the Flamingo
Hotel. FOTO claimed he and ROSELLI were very good friends. .',
Further, that ROSELLI was very close to FRANK COSTELLO (GENOVESE
LON "family" member). In addition, he was told ROSELLI either
has the concession for entertainment or a gift concession in the
Flamingo Hotel. At this time FOTO stated ROSELLI is a "friend
of ours". Formerly ROSELLI was with FRANK COSTELLO, but now is
with VITO GENOVESE. He also stated ROSELLI had the apartment in
back of the Desert Inn and is apparently very wealthy.

IT 7S TO BE NOTED THAT IF ANY OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION
FURNISHED BY NY 5540-C-Te IS USED IN A REPORT OR DISSEMINATED
IN ANY MANNER IT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY PARAPHRASED INASMUCH AS
SHE IDENTITY OF THE INFORMANT COULD EASILY BE ASCERTAINED.

With regard to the statement that ROSELLI has either a
concession for entertainment or the gift concession at the Flamingo
Hotel, it is noted that the Los Angeles Office has no information
to substantiate this. It is recalled, however, that in 1957, when
the Tropicana Hotel was being built, ROSELLI purchased the gift
concession at that hotel for $5,000 which he sold back to the hotel
within a short period of time for $150,000.

 

On 10/14/66, LA 4448-c-TE advised that he had recently
received a telephone call from KAREN FLYNN, an acquaintance of his
whom he had not seen for several years but who he had recalled had
dated JOHN MIRA six or seven years ago. MIRA's father owns the

. Batavia, New York Race Track. It is recalled that KAREN FLYNN has
been previously identified in this investigation as a girl friend
of JOHN ROSELLI.

KAREN FLYNN told LA 4448-c-TE that several years ago
she loaned MIRA $1,000 which he never repaid. She requested
informant to contact MIRA and attempt to obtain this money.

Informant telephonically contacted MIRA who acknowledged
that FLYNN had loaned him some money but he recalled that he had
repaid some of it and owed her not more than half the amount of
$1,000.
