T-5, who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised
that he has been unable to develop any information concerning

the present whereabouts of LA ROCGA., He stated that LA ROCCAts
assoclates have been very secretive of late, but that he has

them to Florida. He stated that he had reason to believe that

Surveitiances Conducted Relatin; +o this ‘Investigation

     

Other than those surveillances conducted at Mercy Hospital,
Pittsburgh, which have already been set forth, spot surveillances
were made.on October 24; November 3, 7, 24, 23; and December

10, 1958, at 900 West Ingomar Road, Ingomar, and at 12 McCandless
Street, Pittsburgh. Nothing of interest to this investigation
was observed during these spot surveillances,.

Other Matters of a Miscellaneous Nature

‘ghe Pittsburgh Press" carried a front page article in its
October 28; 1958, issue entitled, "Probe Spotlight on

Chauffeur of Mannarino." The article stated that a new Ken-
sington, Pa., man named THOMAS "SONNY" CIANCUTTI spent sometime
on October 28; 1958, with the Federal Grand Jury at Pittsburgh.
The article stated that there was speculation that the Grand
Jury was asking CIANCUTTI, reputed. to be the chauffeur of
racket boss GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO, where MANNARINO is
presently hiding. It. said "KELLY" MANNARINQs, had been ducking
process servers with amagdng success for several months since
New York authorities started investigating the "crime convention"
which MANNARINO attended at Apalachin. The paper said that
another man testifying before the Federal Grand Jury on

October 28, 1958, was JOHN FONTANA, convicted of vote fraud in
1954 and the reputed operator of New Kensington's Barbout game.
It should be noted that FONTANA is a close associate of MIKE

_on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Fields.

In connection with the aforementioned efforts ‘to identify

the location of the hunting’ lodge, the informant originally
furnishing this information, learned on October 28; 1958, :
through JACK KRUPA, a New Kensington, Pa., councilman and life-
long friend and hunting companion of the MANNARINO brothers,

that SAMUEL MANNARINO's hunting lodge is not located in
“somerset County, Pa., but is actually a twenty-room farm house ~

generally referred to as a hunting lodge, surrounded by approx-

‘imately 200 acres of densley wooded land in Pennsylvania near

the : Pennsylvania-Maryland border, approximately a fifteen minute
drive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland, The informant
recalled that he had been in the office of SAMUEL MANNARINO
during December, 1957, when the press and radio carried ;
the first. accounts of the fact. that GABRIEL MANNARINO had been
called before the Federal Grand Jury in New York. He stated
that shortly thereafter SAMUEL MANNARINO received a telephone
call from GABRIEL MANNARINO in his presence and hurriedly

told him “they are trying to serve you with a subpoena. Take
off for the brush." ‘The informant stated that it seemed .
logical to him that if SAM MANNARINO's remarks were interpreted
literally his advice could have been his subtle way of telling
his brother to proceed to the hunting lodge.. -

The aforementioned informant said that according to his

source of information, the general area surrounding the

lodge is thickly populated with whiskey stills,.and that local
game wardens are reluctant to enter the area because:some of
them have been mistaken for Agents of the Alcohol and Tobacco
Tax Unit and have been fired upon by the moonshiners.

The Philadelphia Office was requested, through the Recorder

of Deeds for Franklin County, Pa., to attempt to identify

the aforementioned lodge and to display photographs of —
MANNARINO and LA ROCCA at Waynesboro, Pa., and vicinity near —
the Maryland border to game wardens, reliable police officers,
and other sources to locate the hunting lodge and determine
whether MANNARINO and LA ROCCA are hiding out in that locality
or have been there in the past six to ten. months.

that SAMUEL MANNARINO, during the early portion of 1957, mentioned
that he had purchased a hunting lodge surrounded by 200 acres
of land. At that time the informant understood MANNARINO to
say that the lodge was located in Somerset County, Pa., and:
extensive investigation thereafter was conducted to identify.
