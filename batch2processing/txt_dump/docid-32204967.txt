Mr. Warner was not consulted on any surveillance
projects. He was aware that informants had been put ina
construction crew building the Langley headquarters.

D. Loan of Equipment to Local Police Forces

. Mr. Warner was never asked whether it-was proper
for the Agency to loan equipment or personnel to local police
forces. He was generally aware of good relations maintained
by the Agency with local forces.

C. Surveillance of Dissidents

; The Office of General Counsel was asked at the
time of the May Day demonstration to be the focal point for
coordinating actions with the Department of Justice. They
consulted with the Department of Justice about getting
marshals to protect the Agency. They had agreed that the
CIA would pay travel expenses if marshals were brought in
from out of town. At the same time, the OGC was asked
whether it would be proper for the Office of Security to
lend 50 hardhats to the Fairfax police should they need to
be used to protect the headquarters building. The OGC said.

yes. :
E. Assassinations
Mr. Warner has no knowledge of any assassination.
‘ attempts. ‘

F. Allegations in General

‘Mr. Warner has answered the above questions in
light of his personal acquaintance with the projects and his
acquaintance with general OGC knowledge. He says that many
projects may have been discussed by Mr. Howton with the DCI
without his ever being aware of their discussions.

IV. MISCELLANEOUS

At the time of the Patty Hearst kidnap, the FBI
asked the CIA to prepare profiles of the Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA). The request was denied. Mr. Warner would guess
that there is no paper on the request, but that it was handled

in a morning staff meeting.

I. THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL (0OGC)

. The Office of General Counsel has ‘14 lawyers. |
‘All the Lawyers except for one had been recruited from
‘within the rest of the CIA organization. There are a few.
other. persons in the Agency who handled legal functions
outside the Office. of General Counsel: one OGC lawyer is.
detailed to logistics, three work in project MUTUAL, and
a lawyer works within the personnel office. Once a man is
assigned to the OGC, he normally stays there for the rest
of his CIA experience. Mr. Warner and one other lawyer are
the only men in the office who have been detailed elsewhere
in the Agency. The OGC is not divided along directorate
lines. Some lawyers have specialties, but they are

functional specialties.

The OGC is required to be consulted in @ number

of areas: (1) it is consulted on all Section 7 alien

immigration cases;
(3) it approves all administrative plans; (4) it approves

all liquidation plans; and (5) all regulations must be
approved by the OGC. Within recent years, it has reviewed
NSCID's and DCID's,. but there are no requirements for such

reviews.

The OGC has been consulted more regularly on
management decisions within the: past couple of years than
was true under previous DCI's. Mr. Colby consulted the
OGC for guidance on all the directions that went out after

II. THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE CIA ACTIONS
RS SHE CIA ACTIONS

Mr. Warner was in the Office of General Counsel
in OSS. He stayed on to work with the CIG and then on the
legal staff of the cra. He and Mr. Houston were ‘in separate
offices. Warner worked on the 1949 Act; Houston, on the
1947 Act. : .

drafting of a comprehensive bill to be presented to Congress -

in 1947. This bill would have included the provisions which

Mr. Warner suggests that the Commission talk to
Walter Pforzheimer. He was the legislative liaison for the
CIG. He is retired and now lives in Washington.

Mr. Warner would guess that the original Donovan
plan for the CIA<to conduct “subversive Operations" was not
included in the statute because officials were reluctant to
use such words in law in that era. They were similarly

reluctant to use words such as espionage. However,

Mr. Warner says that he doubts that Congress ever contemplated

that the CIA would ever conduct covert activities. He says
that a 1947 OGC legal opinion agrees that Congress did not
contemplate such activities. When such activities were
begun by the Agency, reliance was placed on. the President's
‘inherent power to conduct such activities. Congress has
“xatified this authority by appropriating money over the
years. -A 1962 CIA legal opinion expresses this view. It
was written in conjunction with the Department gf Justice,
which also wrote a legal Opinion at the time. OF
F late
Mr. Warner says the 1949 CIA act was not intended
to expand the functions of the Agency in any way... He said
there were rumblings at that time about the need to conduct
clandestine activities, but those were not taken into
“account in drafting the bill. -

; ; Mr. Warner is not sure why the word "collect"

was not included as.one of the duties of the CIA. He says
that perhaps collection of data from other sources was not
considered as collection of intelligence. The original —
concept of the Agency was that it was to be primarily a
coordinator with some espionage responsibilities. He doubts
that any of the drafters of the legislation had any clear
concept of what the Agency would be doing 10 or 15 years
later. For many years, the other intelligence agencies
thought of the CIA as merely one person among equals. They
resisted allowing the CIA to have direction over their

activities.

III. ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE CIA

A. Mail Intercepts
“Mr. Warner was not aware.of the mail intercept
programs until the Family Jewels episode.

B. The Ober Group

Mr. Warner was generally aware of the Ober .
activities. He was consulted only when it was decided to

end the activity.
