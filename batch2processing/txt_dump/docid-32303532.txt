Re: Ilando CAPOLINO - Brooklyn, N.Y.;
Guido CAPOLINO - Brooklyn, N.Y.3:
Samuel (Sam) MANNARINO -

New Kensington, Pa.

Enquiries in Edmonton, Alberta, disclose that

the flight taken by the CAPOLINO brothers was booked

on August 3, 1965 in New York City. It is presumed

that the booking of this flight was made through the

Air Canada office in New York, as enquiries reveal that
there is an Air Canada flight from New York to Edmonton
via Toronto, Ontario. The C.P.A, flight on September 16
left Toronto at 7:40 a.m. and arrived in Edmonton at
11:h0 a.m.

26 Investigation indicated that the CAPOLINO
brothers only stayed in Edmonton for a matter of a few
hours to make connection with their flight to Prince
George, B.C. It was established that the C.P.A. flight
for Prince George leaves Edmonton at 5:00 PeM.,
arriving’ in Prince George at approximately 7:30 p.m.
