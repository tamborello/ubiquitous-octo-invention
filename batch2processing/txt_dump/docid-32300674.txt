to determine where subject has been staying periodically during
the past two years.

2. Will continue to follow and report activities of
subject and his associates, in accordance with Bureau instructions.

ADMINISTRATIVE:

responsibilities associated with the recent office inspection,

and due to desire to await results of investigation in the
Miami Division, in the interest of continuity.
