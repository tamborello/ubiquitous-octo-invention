Report of SA EDWARD KINZER, JR., dated August 10,
1959, at Chicago, set ates a lead to have MM .660-PC
recontacted for any. rmation he might possess
on this case. SAPP ARES

On September 23, 1959, MM 660-PC advised
SA HURST that he has no additional information regarding this
case. MM .660-PC said from conversations overheard, it
appears that the identity of the Government witness against
MANNARINO and ROTHMAN who appeared before the. Federal Grand
Jury, Chicago, is unknown to MANNARINO and ROTHMAN, but
they would like to learn the identity of any witness. PC
said no threats have been overheard against any witness
and it is the opinion of MM 660-PC that no retaliation
would be made against any witness, as apparently SAMMY
MANNARINO and ROTHMAN became involved in in this bond deal
on their own.

- Miami Western Union records referred to in this
report were made available to SA LENIHAN by Z..F. KEATHLEY,
Manager of the Western Union Office in Miami.

HOGAN's phone records referred to in this

Cuban airplaines at the Miami International. Airport-
recently. ROTHMAN did not disclose the identity of the
"crime syndicate" he referred to but he described it as
- "the organization." : :

desire to take over gambling in Cuba in the event CASTRO
is-overthrown but they do desire to obtain business con-
cessions and franchises. ROTHMAN added that he personally ,-
expected to receive a hundred thousand dollars for a share
in the contract to assassinate MORGAN.

STAFFORD, JR., that ROTHMAN told him that he is .in solid
with the MANARINO gang in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, and »

government of FIDEL CASTRO in Cuba.
