"West Side bloc", but who has advised that he is making every.
attempt to combat the influence of GIANCANA and his associates -
in Chicago politics without,making an open issue of it, From
the above conversation it would appear that GIROLAMI recently
. refused GIANCANA's suggestion that he make jobs available to
PORCARO, It is noted that CG 6498-PC has. more patronage jobs
available to him than practically any other Chicago politician _
due to the fact that he not only has 275 jobs under his command:
as Democratic Ward Committeeman of the 28th Ward but also has
71 jobs under his command as Clerk of: the Probate.Court, He also :
_is influential in obtaining jobs. due to the fact that he is a
"member of. the Cook. County ‘Central Committee which is responsible :
for slating individuals for Democratic nominations in Cook
County... PORCARO's. reference: to the. Sheriff would: seers? FRANK
