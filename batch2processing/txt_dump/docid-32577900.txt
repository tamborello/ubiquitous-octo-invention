and other unknown individuals. Dr. FRANK stayed at the
Bourbon Orleans while in town. NO 1734-PC stated that
MARCELLO ordered him to send to Dr. FRANK on 11/21/68, a
package containing the complete deposition given by MARCELLO
to Life Magazine recently.

NO 1734-PC advised that the reason for the coolness
between JOSEPH PORETTO, suspected LCN member, and MARCELLO
is that PORETTO allowed a sewerage bill in excess of $10,000
to accumulate on the Town and Country Restaurant and Lounge,
which was billed to the motel. . PORETTO refused payment of this
bill, and NO 1734-PC advised MARCELLO: that, inasmuch as
PORETTO's lease option had expired, to put him on a month-to-
month rental basis, which was done. Therefore, PORETTO has
nothing to sell if he wants to get out of the restaurant,
except his fixtures and goodwill.

NO 1734-PC advised that CARLOS MARCELLO can read
words in English.but has difficulty in putting phrases and
sentences together and, therefore, relies entirely on PHILLIP
SMITH for direction and guidance. MARCELLO has recently
instructed SMITH to tutor JOE C. MARCELLO in the handling of
real estate matters, but JOE C. MARCELLO is not overly
intelligent and probably, in NO 1734-PC's opinion, will not
be able to grasp the intricacies of real estate transactions.

NO 1734-PC advised that JOE C. MARCELLO has PHILLIP
SMITH's telephone tapped, aS well as JOE C. MARCELLO's wife's
telephone tapped. NO 1734~PC advised that BILLY GAUTREAU,
former administrative assistant in the Jefferson Parish
Coroner's Office, was one of the individuals utilized. by
MARCELLO to tap telephones. GAUTREAU was recently sentenced
to eighteen months in Angola for obtaining funds fraudulently
from the Coroner's ‘Office.

NO 1734-PC advised that an individual known to him

“only as TEX, who is presently incarcerated in a prison in

Texas, was another individual utilized by MARCELLO to tap

Country, and NO 1734-PC has assisted: him in setting traps to
reveal the identity of this source. .

~~ FO ‘1734- PC advised. that “MARCELLO has many contacts
throughout the state and, therefore, NG 1734-PC.is extremely
concerned regarding his own identity as a source. NO 1734-PC
refused to go into specifics because of ‘the circumstances of
the contact and the limited time of the contact,: but this will

evening of 11/21/68, requesting a recontact on early AM
of 11/22/68. Contact.made, and NO 1734-PC advised that,
after considerable wrestling with his conscience during the
night, he had come to the conclusion that he would cooperate
without reservation. He stated he would do so only with
complete assurances that his identity would never be revealed
outside the Bureau. Thereafter, NO 1734~PC furnished the
following information: .

SMITH because MARCELLO's son, JOSEPH C. MARCELLO, is a possible
target of a Federal Grand Jury subpoena for having witnessed

representing himself as LEONARD CUNNING, who was killed in
gangland fashion; in Kansas City on 10/1/68,

No 1734-PC stated that MARCELLO has ordered PHILLIP
SMITH tc seli.off real estate investments which would .
normally be held for long term speculative investments
because MARCELLO is in dire need of ready cash. NO 1734- PC.
stated that PHILLIP SMITH has been associated with: MARCELLO -
since 1950 and,outside the immediate family, is the most
trusted confidant MARCELLO has, handling all his real estate
transactions and advising him on a daily basis regarding his
investments.

NO 1734-PC stated that GIUSEPPE GAGLIANO (former
under boss in New Orleans) met with MARCELLO in his office
at the motel yesterday for unknown reason. NO 1734-PC
advised that FRANK GAGLIANO has approached MARCELLO for money
to purchase a home and was turned down by MARCELLO. NO 1734-PC
stated MARCELLO offered to. lend GAGLIANO the $300 closing costs
but no more. ;

NO 1734-PC stated that an individual, known to him as

Dr. FRANK (RAGANG), attorney for SANTO TRAFFICANTE, was in town
