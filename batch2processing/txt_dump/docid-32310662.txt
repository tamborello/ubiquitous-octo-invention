. Wilda
On November 28, 1963, MM T-4, who is in x
contact with Comandos L leaders, advised that factionalism
had developed inside the organization. The factionalism
is on the leadership level between SANTIAGO ALVAREZ RODRIGUEZ
| and ANTONIO CUESTA DEL VALLE, In early Decémber , 1963,
, ALVAREZ RODRIGUEZ became relatively inactive, and his son,
| .. | SANTIAGO ALVAREZ” FERNANDEZ, took over? “It ‘appeared that
CUESTA has been able to maintain the support of the ma oraey
’ of the action group members, MM T-4 explained that “ALVARE
; - FERNANDEZ has been visiting neW political sources trying
to buy: automatic weapons . and explosives. (lM
RNANDEZ Stated |

On December 13, 1963, ALVAREZ”
the organization had become "too political" and a’split™
had developed, but there would be no announcements concéerii>
ing this factionalisn. ALVAREZ ‘has’ been’ desperately trying
to locate a 1.57 mm, recoilless ¥ifle. Hé Claimed that all-
the necessary equipment for a raid has been assembled, but
that the mission cannot go out without the”.57 mm. ‘Tego! less
rifle, ALVAREZ further made a comment concerning a letter -
which was circulated to the effect that. neither’ he nor his
father, SANTIAGO ALVAREZ RODRIGUEZ, was authorized to collect
funds for Comandos L. (UV).

On December 19, 1963,: MM T-4 stated that ALVAREZ
FERNANDEZ was still looking for a .57 mm. recoilless rifle,
and had- planned to go’on a three-day misSion.- ALVAREZ said : : {
the purpose’ of the mission would bé to tést Président’ JOHNSON's
policy concerning Cuba,“ and’ to obtain press publicity to
stimulate money contributions. (LY

On December ‘24, 1963, MM T-4 advised that ALVAREZ ; :
has not been able to obtain the’ .57 mm. recoilless rifle,’ : .
and it now appears that he lacks and ammunition and explosives A
to conduct a raid against Cuba. ul i
