Memorandum from John A. Hartingh to Mrs. Morris, dated 12/18/95
Re: JFK TASK FORCE

19. HQ 62-109060-1NR2321, NAR 124-10030-10093,
identifies | Jas a confidential source. The ARRB OTHER 4

had voted to open this document in full at their meeting 10/23 -
24/95. The FBI provided the ARRB with additional information
once the source was found and interviewed. The source stated
that he is still in contact with the person he reported on and
fears for his safety. The ARRB reconsidered this document at
this meeting and voted to sustain the name of the source and
singular identifying information until 2017. The substitute
language would be "name" and "informant identifying information".
. 20. HQ 62-109060-5NR1275, NAR 124-10027-10065,
identifies John Wesley Hall as a potential informant. The
individual is deceased. The Birmingham office interviewed his
widow concerning the harm to the surviving family should his
status as an FBI informant be made public. The widow requested
that the confidential relationship be protected. The ARRB
sustained the postponement of his name for a period of five
years.

21 - 25. HQ 105-82555-8, 9, 10, 11, & 1NR16, NAR 124-
10023-10234, 10235, 10236, 10237, & 10238, are documents with
information from the Swiss government. These documents were
opened in full by the ARRB at a prior meeting and appealed by the
FBI to the President. The FBI withdrew its appeal and the ARRB
voted to reconsider their decision and wait to hear from the
Swiss government. The Swiss government requested that only the
names of their citizens be protected in these documents. The
ARRB sustained the postponements until the year 2017 with the
substitute language of "name of Swiss citizen".

The FBI provided written justifications arguing the
need to protect the individuals and singular information listed
above. However, the ARRB supports the position that the
information ordered disclosed is relevant and significant to the
assassination and that it outweighs any harm that would be caused
to the individuals to be disclosed.

As experienced in the prior appeal to the President, we
have difficulty meeting the statutory burden of protecting FBI
symbol number informants, PSI’s and PCI’s under the JFK statute.
We would have to determine whether they are alive, locate them

: and/or their relatives, interview them for their position on

Memorandum from John A. Hartingh to Mrs. Morris, dated 12/18/95
Re: JFK TASK FORCE

the information he provided was very limited. The efforts to
locate this individual were not successful. The Springfield,
Massachusetts Resident Agency tried to find the PCI, but he seems
to have left the area without a trace. The ARRB has opened this
document in full.

11. DL 100-10461-1458, NAR 124-10001-10059, is
information from DL 6-S about a lunch conversation between Joe
Landin and Augustin Estrada. The postponed information was
narrowed as much as possible with the redactions for that
information which was singularly identifying. The informant was
contacted by the Chief Deputy Counsel of the Dallas office. The
informant requested that his identity be withheld because he
still lives in the same area and associates with some of the same
people. The ARRB decided to withhold the numeric portion of his
symbol number and the sequential portion of his file number for
10 years and to release all singular information.

12-13. HQ 62-109060-4450, HQ 105-82555-1505, NAR 124-
10058-10056, NAR 124-10035-10155, both documents involve
MM 639-S. The JFK Task Force had previously agreed with the ARRB
to only postpone the numeric portion of the symbol number, unless
the field office prefix of the symbol number could not be
determined from the communication and the prefix in itself was
singularly identifying. Previously the ARRB postponed the
numeric portion of symbol numbers until the year 2017, but the
ARRB voted to sustain the numeric portion of this symbol number
for 10 years.

14-15. HQ 105-82555-1976, HQ 62-109060-2987, NAR 124-
10062-10385, NAR 124-10079-10230, is about two informants, MEX 18
& 19 -S, who were providing information on Americans visiting the
Communist American community in Mexico during the time of the JFK
assassination. These informants were very close to Elizabeth
Catlett Mora. One document sets out the details of a dinner
party attended by four people, while the second document concerns
the travel of Joseph and Eva Frank Bernstein while they were in
Mexico during 1964. Both of the informants are deceased, but
their son was interviewed about the release of information which
could tend to identify the relationship his parents had with the
FBI. The family requested that the confidential relationship be
maintained. They did not want that information to become public,
because one daughter is living in Mexico and her reputation and

Re: JFK TASK FORCE

work could be affected by the knowledge of her parents’
relationship with the FBI. The ARRB sustained the numeric
portion of the symbol numbers for 10 years, but released the
singular information in both documents.

16. HQ 62-109060-3447, NAR 124-10058-10033, 10023,
10024, identifies SA 673-S as providing information about Alfred
Dwight Amos Featherston, who supposedly knew something about the
JFK assassination. The JFK Task Force had narrowed the
postponements to the most singularly identifying information and
had reconciled the release to reflect all that was previously
released. The informant is deceased. A surviving daughter was
interviewed concerning harm should the confidential relationship
of her father with the FBI be revealed and she did not have a
problem with the information being made public, as long as his
true identity being revealed. The ARRB sustained the numeric
portion of the symbol number and the sequential portion of the
file number for 10 years, but released the singular identifying
information.

17. HQ 62-109060-2981, NAR 124-10058-10009, identifies
LA 3436-S as “the daughter of Charlotte Randall McElfresh”. The
ARRB had voted to open this document at their last meeting. When
the FBI provided the results of her interview, the ARRB voted to
reconsider the additional information at this meeting. The
informant requested that her identity as an informant continue to
be protected. At this meeting the ARRB sustained the
postponement of the numeric portion of the symbol number and the
phrase “is the daughter of” for a period of 5 years and to use
substitute language of “identifies the relationship”.

18. HQ 62-109060-1042, NAR 124-10027-10024, identifies
an informant, since his name is written to the side of his "134"
file number. The informant is the same as MM 639-S addressed in
items 12 & 13 above. The informant was contacted by the CDC of
the Miami office and requested that his confidential relationship
with the FBI continue to be protected, since he was aware of
someone wanting to kill whoever reported on them to the FBI. The
ARRB sustained the postponement of the sequential portion of the
file number and the informant’s true name for 10 years, with the
substitute language of file number and informant’s name.
