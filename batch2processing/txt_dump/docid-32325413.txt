Perjury
oa In preparation for the trial of the captioned subject,

George F. Callahan, Jr. was interviewed on February 2, 1960.

With reference to money which Mr. Callahan sent to Wein-
heimer in Des Moines, he advised that his best recollection is
that he secured 10 one hundred dollar bills, placed plain white

paper around the bills, and then placed the wrapped bills in three
No. 10 size envelopes.

_ With reference to the cash sent to Detroit, Mr. Callahan
utilized the same procedure except that only two No.10 size enve-

lopes were sent and they contained $1,000-in one hundred dollar
bills.

 

Based upon this information, it is requested that through
your sources at the Post Office you simillate the envelopes, paper
and cash in order to determine the weight of such envelopes and
what postage was required in 1957 for their mailing.
