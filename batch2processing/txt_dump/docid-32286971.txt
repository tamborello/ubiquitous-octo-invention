CHICAGO DIVISION ~ ‘1 PRog Ritin

Attached hereto is an editorial appearing in the Chisago
Sun-Times of July 11, 1963, which is critical of Police Super-
intendent 0. W. WILSON of the Chicago Police Department, for
failure to clean up the "strip and clip" joints in Chicago's
Loop and First Ward District. It also is critical of the Chicago
Police Department for failure to enforce a local ordinance
prohibiting the soliciting of persons to purchase alcoholic
beverages. 7

Veteran crime reporter SANDY SMITH of the Sun-Times,
has this week prepared a number of articles exposing the use of
B-girls in bars in the First Ward and showing that the proceeds
of thege bars has been going to the Syndicate. Confidential
Informant CG.6649-C, who is herself a "stripper" in these bars,
has told us previously that these are local girls working in |
the. . bars, and are not brought in from out of state. (!

ho . SANDY SMITH has told us that he has uncovered no ZN
evidence- ‘of any WSTA or ITAR violations and the Chicago Office
has been, following this matter closely. We were well aware of
all ‘of this information and it has previously been reported in
connection with our investigation into the Chicago First Ward
and related hoodlums. The connection between Chicago hoodlums
and the "joints" in the Chicago area has previously been
established. ,

{/ This matter is being followed closely - $0. in; the event
axe any violation "Belgong ane can take” “ ‘against
i odlums, it will" be'‘doné. .
