TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL

LA COSA NOSTRA
ANTI-—RACKTVEERI

 

It ha previously been pointed out. that one of

our primary ; s in the Criminal Intelligence Program is
the full id (‘fication and subsequent prosecution of the
membership of La Cosa Nostra qn), the dominant group in

- organized orime-im thie counir With an ever-increasing
public awareness of the significance of LER on a national
basis, and in consideration of the Bureau's heavy
responsibilities in the field of organized crime, it is ;
yeaa that complete intelligence be developed regarding

   

A substantial number of LCN members have boon
identified by many offices, however, a review of monthly
airtels submitted by your office. Yegarding acconplishnents
in the Criminal Intelligence Pregram discloses that within
the past one-year period, the nuaber of LCN members
identified within your division has decreased from six to
five. This serves to highlight the urgent need for your
office to obtain sources who can reliably identify LOW
membership within your division. The basic make-up of LCR
in Maryland hae beéa relatively undeveloped.

PERSONAL ATTENTION

 

Our investigations of LCN have revealed the absolute

necessity of establishing sources who are in a pesition to

provide accurate and authentic data regarding this organization.
Et has also beenishown that a complete picture conceraing the

prevalence of LCN in 2 particular area cannot be established

without such sources. The importance of dev loping 5 member

informant in LC cannot be overenphasized.

 

; You are expected te show a marke: improvement in

' identifying LCN members within your division. To this end,
there * must be a concentrated and. imaginative effort to
x the significant

 
   

e results.
