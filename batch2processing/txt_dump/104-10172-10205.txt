told source that he had received a telegraa from Herdquarters ordering
him to concentrate on obtaining inforzaticn about GOLITSYN, (+0 whon
the X.G.B. had civon tne abusive nicknane URCB), because acconling to
their infomation GOLITSYN had visited England several tines, and wht}
thoy had now established "the place of recidence" they had no approach}
to hin,  Uoscow required détailed infomation about where he wns lis
hie habits end activities, Fren the wording of this telegram source
