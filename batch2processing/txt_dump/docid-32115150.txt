Dear Charles, , DECLALS:

President Kennedy's death. That this terrible !
thing should have happened to the President of ‘the :
~~ United States is a tragedy for the whole free world :

and all your many friends over here feel it deeply ;
and are suffering froma. sense of shock.

; iy fourteen year old son, who is at
boarding school in the wilds of Scotland, has .
written to say that when the news was announced on i
Friday “the whole school was silent and numb", “

This must be a very sad and difficult. '
time for your Director and your colleagues in the
Bureau and I send you all my deep and most sincere
sympathy. : : :

Yours sincerely,

Gna
