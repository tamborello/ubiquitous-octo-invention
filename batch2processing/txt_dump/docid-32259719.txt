Subject: The Fair Play for Cuba Committee

Informant says one Roberto (LNU) requested that the Cuban
Foreign Ministry furnish him biographical information on
Manuel Beaton ad Conte Aguero to write articles about
these persons on the "Fact Sheet". Information on Conte:
Head of Public Relations Department of Cuban Foreign
Ministry described Conte as a traitor to his country.
Said Conte's allegations against Cuba were copied word
for word from assertions of the White Rose organization.
After Batista was ousted, Conte was devoid of all in-
fluence and tried to reestablish friendship with Castro
and Castro was generous enough to forgive him. Says
Conte is presently attempting to be placed in charge of
anti-Cuban programs on Voice of America.

Same informant says that Robert Taber (a FPCC member)
has made trips to Havana to confer with Castro.
