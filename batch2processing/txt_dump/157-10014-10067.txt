Mr. Tweedy. All that happened then, absolutely.

Mr. Baron. Do'you remember: discussions with Livingstond
Merchant in the State Department before the turn of Adminin-~
trations?

Mr. Tweedy. I knew Livingstone Merchant put specific
discussions with him T really do not recall, no. Later on
t remember having 4 couple of meetings along with Mr. Rusk .

Mr. Baron. nid any of those meetin concern Lumumba?

My. Tweedy. No, Rusk, T think they exclusively

concerned Portuguese Africa.

Mr. Baron. Do you remember having any meetings alone
with Herter, Secretary Herter, about Lumumha?
Mr. Tweedy. Fo am not sure r have had a meeting with tr.
Herter,
tir. Baron. Did you Aave any meetings with secretary
terter or Doualas Dillon or Livinastene Merchant?
Pweay . Never Mr. Dillon.
Raron. About Congolese affairs?
Mr, Tweedy. Never met “r. Dillon and T da tot recall
having met with Livinastone Merchant on the Conga. T may

have done so but T really don't recall, had very little

 
Professional contact with Mr. Merchant. I knew him mostly

slightly socially.

Mr. Baron. When you met regularly with mr. Satterawate
or Mr. Penfield did you discuss Lumumba with them?

Mr. Tweedy. I am sure we discussed Lumumba in the
sense of which would be all the time, assessing the situa-
tion, assessing where Lumumba was heading, where the Congo
was heading. I did this with, you know, almost all of the
African situations, individual African country situations.

We would spend a great deal of time, their points of
view, our point of view, cur perspective, their perspective,
but never as an action matter that I can recall.

Mr. Baron. Was the assassination of Patrice Lumumba
ever contemplated or raised in those meetings?

Mr. Tweedy. Never.

Mr. Baron, Did you meet regularly in this period
between Congolese independence and the announced death of
Lumumba with people at the NSC level or people in the White
House? :

Mr. Tweedy. I don't recall so at all. For example, if
President Eisenhower had an African representative the same

S
way President Kennedy later had, then I can't recall who he
was. President Kennedy had two. The first name escapes

me. He kater went on down to South Africa as Ambassador

and one that I saw most of for a considerable period of

Mr. Tweedy. WAs that the month of his death?
Mr. Baron. The month the death was announced.

As you know, there is a lot of mystery surrounding his

Prone jArea 207} 344-6600

death and the probable cause of his death, AS far as the U.N,
investigation was concerned it was January 17 or perhaps
January 18, 1961.

Mr, Tweedy. Yes.

Mr. Baron. What was the nature of your contact with
the State Department during that period of time?

Mr. Tweedy. My recollection of thia is far less

 

Congo and far more gencral, as I was menttoning to you as

we strolled, and particularly my talks with Jim Penfield, te

 

whom Joe Satterswate was dedicated.

Joe Satterswate, who was Assistant Secretary for

Mr. Baron. And how long did you serve as Chie fof

Mr. Tweedy. Until September of ‘63.

Prone [Aree 202) 344-4000

Mr. Baron. In that position did you consult frequent

 

with people in policy-making positions at the State Department?
- Mr. Tweedy. Well, as I was explaining to you as we
were strolling around, the simple answer to that is yes.
These consultations would take many, many different forms.
On the Congo, for example, the State Napartment

obviously was just as involved as practically the rest of the

 

U.S, Government and they had a Congolese task force. I
would attend their meetings or a representative of mine would
attend their meetings. They took place almost daily,
sometimes I guess even more than once daily.

Mr. Baron. During what period of time?

Mr. Tweedy. Oh, Lord, from the time the Congo thin;
really hotted up, and I am talking then particularly under the
Kennedy Administration, when Mennen Williams organized the
task force and Wayne Fredericks was his deputy; those meet-
ings were State's meetings, they weren't CIA meetings, they
weren't meetings primarily to discuss the CIA policy, but
we had to be there to maintain, to kecp abreast of what the
policy was.

Mr. Baron. If we could focus our attention on the

Mr. Baron. And you are willing to continue to testify

to the truth as best you can?

Mr. Tweedy. Indeed I will.

Mr. Baron, Perhaps we should begin by putting on the
record a bit of your background in Agency activities leading
to the point at which you assumed the position as Chief of
the African Division.
