-3, It is realized that an operational progress report end a contact
report are txe different items; however, in view of the detailed nature of
the LITAMIL#G C2's the Station has felt that their submission has satisfied
the requirements of operational reporting, The criticism of reference is
all the more puzzling Since such visitors to the Station as Chester Db
Lainoleé, Chiel, Witu; vton A, Weclley, erstuiile Chief of Operaticns,
and ‘homas W, Laud, pr Fexie> Eranen Chief, heve all expressed
appesvel of the cetadled operational reporting on this cperation during
visits they have made to the Staticn at which time the reports in questicn
have been brought te the’r attention,
