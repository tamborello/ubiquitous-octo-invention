show thet Pedro Luis Gutierrez sought asylum in the Dominican Republic
during 1933, returned te Cuba in 1936, and again took asylum in the
Dominican Republic in September, 1944. It is known that he later
returned to Cuba but our files do net indicate when.

One of our sources who formerly worked closely with
Pedro Luis Gutierrez has received information indicating that as of
May, 1963, Gutierrez was a lieutenant in the Department of Information
,0f the Cuban G-2 and that his wife was at that time a member of the
Cuban Militia. ; |

° * Im view of the foregoing, it ie suggested that(Pedro Luis
Gutierrez might possibly be identical with “Alberto.” a )

 

NOTE: Classified "Secret" since information from a previous
CIA letter: so classified is repeated herein and since we refer
to specific activities in a foreign country of one of our
representatives, CIA has brought a defected Cuban official from
Brazil to the U. S. and he has been attempting to give CIA the
exact picture of the Cuban intelligence organization as it exists
under Castro, He described “Alberto” as a key intelligence _
official and said employees under “Alberto” did not knowhis true
| name but knew him as the person who claimed to have been responsible
| for the arrest of a German master spy in Havana during 1942, U }

 

   
 

Section Chief D. J. Brennan recalled Luning's identity
and review of his file shows that 5A Edwin L. Sweet of Miami
Office and MM 492-S, who was then a high Cuban Police official,
were responsible for i g'sarrest and they also obtained a
fullconfession from Luning. Checks with SA-Sweet and MM 492-5
show Gutierrez was present at the arrest and MM 492-S, who served
as Gutierrez's superior for many years, now believes Gutierrez

was a fanatical communist throughout théir association.
