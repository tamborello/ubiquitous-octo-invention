ROSSELLI returned to Los Angeles 12/6/62, on which
date he told LA 4268-c that he had just got into town that
day.. ROSSELLI asked informant how he was going on his deal
with GEORGE SEEDMAN (SEEDMAN represents Rowe Vending Company
and has been negotiating with informant relative to informant
working for SEEDMAN. SEEDMAN has told informant that his
(SEEDMAN's) superior is one PAT O'MALLEY of Chicago).

ROSSELLI told informant that he was back "there"
and checked and there. is no PAT O'MALLEY; that he had been
talking to the "big guy" back there. ROSSELLI asked
informant how many vending machines GEORGE SEEDMAN has
and when informant said about 4,000, ROSSELLI replied that
he had just left a guy who has 10,000 machines.

ROSSELLI then asked numerous questions about
SEEDMAN's operations and requested informant to obtain all
the information he could relative to SBEDMAN's operations.
_ Informant told ROSSELLI that SEEDMAN had been having some

trouble in one of his spots and O'MALLEY was coming out to
fix it up. ROSSELLI replied that "O'MALLEY can't fix anything-- !
that's done up north." (The meaning of the latter part of :
this statement is unknown.)
