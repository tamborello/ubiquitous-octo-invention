SOURCE: A former high-level Cuban official who was once active in the revolutimary
movement and a confidant of Fidel Castro. He has always been anti~Commnist and
is now strongly anti-Castro. He continues to maintain contact with many Cuban
officials at all levels of government, Source has provided a limited number of
reports which appear to have been accurate. ,

Headquarters Comment. Source, who also has good contacts among leaders of the
Federacion Estudiantil Universitaria (FEU, University Student Federation), re-
ported on 2 February 1965 that Jaime Crombet and Lazaro Mora would be elected
president and vice-president, respectively, at the 8 - 10 February elections
of FW officers at the University of Havana. The following comments by Source
are reported in light of his experience and insight in Cuban student matters.

i Jaime Crombet, newly elected president of the Federacion Estudiantil Universi-

' teria (FEU) at the University of Havana, has little influence over the University

f atudents and will find it difficult to restrict them to the ideological frame-

i work which the Cuban régime tries to impose. Lazaro Mora,.the new vice-president, |

} although younger than Crombet, is a member of the student “old guard;" he worked

t with Rolando Cubela Secades during the period when the latter was president of -

i the FJ, from late 1959 fo 1961. Mora still maintains close contact with Cubela, “

: who apparently plans to retain his influence at the University with the students 7

: sity. It is certain that Fidel Castro will not be able to control the students 5
through Crombet as he has done through his predecessor, Jose Rebello Alanso, :

* for the past two years. The fact that the students no longer react spontaneously ‘
will make Crombet's task a difficult one. Crombet may be able to attract. members =
ef the Union de Jovenes Comunistas (UJC, Union of Communist Youths), cf which he ‘
has been president, but Mora is considered the leader of the anti-Commmist groups j

at the University. A small Trotskyist group still exists, but it is insignificant. «
