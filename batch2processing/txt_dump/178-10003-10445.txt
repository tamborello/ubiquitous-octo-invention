Mr. James A. Wilderotter
Associate Counsel to the President
Room 182

Old Executive Office Building
Washington, D.c.

Dear Jim:

As you can readily see from the attached memoranda
and files, this collection of papers is incomplete,
disorganized, fragmentary and by no means a coherent
account of MONGOOSE or anything else.

However, this is what we have pulled together.
This is what has seen and for some reason

he is quite comrortable with it. He has asked if he
could have this on loan to be returned Friday evening

for his use in connection with the Committee's interviews
of Rusk, McNamara, Maxwell Taylor and others.

As I told you on the phone there isn't anything
in this file which they haven't already seen and I shall
be grateful to you for what help you can offer.

Sincerely,

Yet Chl

Walter Elder
Assistant to the Director
