RE: LA COSA NOSTRA

   

AR - CONSPIRACY

\ MM 1231-C-TE advised on 10/28/67, that, with regard
to the BONANNO family LCN situation, he has learned that,
according to his sources, it has not improved, and is
deteriorated to the point whereby informant does not see how
a “war can be averted. He asserts that BONANNO will not be
deterred from controlling his family and will not back down.
Informant advises that BONANNO at least has all the necessary
weapons, ammunition and manpower needed to fulfill his ambition
in this regard, or at least BONANNO feels certain of this.

Informant was asked how WILLIE DARA (LCN member of
BONANNO family, residing Miami) feeis about this and where he
will stand in loyalty and advised that DARA, if pinpointed
by his Regime, will ask to be put in inactive status, that
he is “too old't for this nonsense.

Informant states that he learned from a source whose 4
reliability is not certain and therefore cannot state the
| degree of veractiy of the information, that the brother-in~
law of TOMMY LUCHESE has stepped in and has taken over the,
| LUCHESE family. Informant is not aware of the name of this
individual.
