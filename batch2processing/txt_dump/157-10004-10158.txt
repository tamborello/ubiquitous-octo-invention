last time he was in the Embassy talking to Rax Kail, he (Kail)
told him he was gx going to the United States and he would come
back and talk to him later. Kail said he was going to Texas

for Christmas. That's why he always thought Bishop xxkxkxx had
told him to go to Kail because he thought ke perheps they were
friends from Texas. .

to ask him about Masfeerer now. (Why?) Because there was a lot
