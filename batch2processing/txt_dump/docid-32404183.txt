MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
FROM: Executive Director

SUBJECT: Completing Work on JFK Assassination Records

1. Your office has asked whether additional’ resources are
needed to complete work on the JFK records by the deadline
established by Congress of 22 August 1993. Barring the
unforeseen, we should meet the deadline.

2. The Historical Review Group expects to complete review of
all hard copy files (some 250,000 pages) by early June. Since
coordination with the directorates has lagged, we have taken steps
to increase the number of directorate reviewers. The DO has
approximately doubled the number of reviewers to eight. They are
committed to adding additional resources if required.

3. The second problem is the need to prepare identification
aids for every document transferred to the National Archives. I
have given approval for up to 20 indexers and document analysts to
work overtime on this effort.

4. A potential problem exists in processing a box of
microfilm, which contains the equivalent of some 172,000 pages of
additional material. The Historical Review Group believes a large
part consists of duplicates of material already reviewed. They
should know whether this assumption is correct within the next few
days. In any event, I will assign additional resources if needed.

5. The President has yet to name the Review Board called for

by the JFK Act; therefore, we cannot determine whether the board
will have additional requirements for us.
