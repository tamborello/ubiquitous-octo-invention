At the bottom of the window walls facing northward
is a metal hood covering a baseboard type finned heating pipe. {
At the juncture of the common wall this pipe, less its fins,
penetrates from LEATH's apartment through the common wall
which is approximately 14" thick at this; point into an area
he a ingide a similar hood covering in ALEX's apartment.
Using a ' with a glass tube penetrating through the
common wall: y reception of the ringing of ALEX's telephone gave
indication that an installation of this type could be
successful in picking up voices in ALEX's apartment.

Should this imtallation be approved, a 24 guage
>two-conductor cable would be led from thermicrophone and led
westward along the window wall inside the hood previously
mentioned. The hood terminates at LEATH's west wall and it is _
believed that the baseboard could be pried back sufficiently
to accept the cable which would have to run geproximately
18 feet to a point where it could enter a ented —
telephone outlet. This outlet has a six pafr”cable, one pair
which is used for LEATH's service. This cable terminates in
-a wire closet on the ninth floor, one floor beneath apartment
of ALEX, and it is anticipated that a leased line service
can be secured to the Chicago Office consolidated plant without
charge.

 

Inasmuch as the afore-mentioned service, of necessity,
had to be conducted when ALEX's apartment was empty., the
quality of a misur on this target will not be determined until
the installation would be accomplished,

Should authorization be received, LEATH will not in
any: way be apprised of the fact that a technical operation has
been installed and that the conductor passes through his
apartment.

 

It is recommended that the Bureau authorize Chicago /
to install a misur of ALEX in the manner indicated above.
