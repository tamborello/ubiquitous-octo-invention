MARCELLO was convicted of violation of the Marijuana °
Tax Act in United States District Court, New Orleans, Louisiana,

October 29, 1938. He was sentenced to one year and one day
in the United States Penitentiary. MARCELLO's conviction was

based upon the sale of 634 ounces of marijuana December 6, 1937,

and 3163 ounces of marijuana December 15, 1937, to GILMORE
FAILOR, Agent, United States Narcotics Bureau, New Orleans,
Louisiana. .

6 MARCELLO has been the subject of innumerable suits

and appeals through the Immigration and Naturalization Service
and through the UnftedStates District Court and on May 3, 1955,

the United States Stipreme Court affirmed MARCELLO's deporta-
tion and on August 85.1955, he surrendered to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service,

On August 9, 1955, the Italian Consul, City of
New Orleans, requested the return of MARCELLO's. passport and
on December 16, 1955, Judge HUGO BLACK, United States Supreme
Court, ordered MARCELLO's release on $10,000 bond.

This bond has subsequently been reduced to a
parole agreement.

On February 7, 1958, informant L______lor
New Orleans furnished information that CARL NOLL had -
obtained citizenship papers (apparently birth certificate)
in CARLOS MARCELLO's true name MINACORE, in Guatemala,
(This information was disseminated to Immigration and
Naturalization Service March 21, 1958.)

J. MARVIN HOSTEPTER, Uniléed ‘States Immigration and Naturali-
zation Service, Philadel) haar? Pennsylvania, and a copy. of
this report was furnished to New Orleans by Bureau letter
of February 9, 1960.

. JAT WAGE:
Contact should be established with the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to determine if that Agency has
interviewed or has considered interviewing of VALADERES and

GENIS in Guatemala. Immigration should also be contacted to
determine if efforts have been made to locate the alleged

_ birth records which ‘may possibly exist ina village outside

Guatemala City.

From both Agencies, it shoulda bepdetemined if the
bank records of the Banko De Nationale show that MARCELLO
has transferred funds to Guatemala City.

 

“The State ‘Department should be contacted to deter-
mine if Article 13 of the-Rranco --Italian Consular Convention
of September 28, 18 , _ coeiiayts and if this Treaty would estab-
lish MARCELLO's 1th war odie izenship.

  
  

The current“status of the Civil Suit as it exists
in Italy should also be determined era the State Department
or from Bureau Leget of Rome, .

In view of the current importance of the investigation

of MARCELLO, the Bureau's Liaison Section is requested to deter-

mine the Agency which will conduct investigation at Guatemala
City and vicinity to either confirm or refute the. information
furnished by CARL NOLL. It is entirely possible that either
Immigration Service or the Narcotic Service has completed, or
is presently endeavoring to complete, this investigation and
before efforts are-made by the Bureau to obtain this informa-
tion, it is believed: that above Agencies should be contacted
in order to prevent duplication of investigation efforts and
possible interference by the FBI in a matter which is primarily
within the jurisdiction of other Government Agencies. In the
event the other Agencies have not undertaken this phase of

the investigation of MARCELLO based upon information furnished
y NOLL, it is recommended that Bureau reques & appropriate
\Sources in Guatemala] to obtain theJinformation outlined above.
