Ag Daring Rabuey's TDY fa Rome ‘a April 1961, Clarkson. gave him the
i Tonitaso COPBISLERO, owner of the. Ear Marisa fn Florence, ao
Bott .

  
  
  

 

  
  

: Tae criteria sheet left ‘with
Bo Shoridsiz’ by Rabuey is basic reference document for Clarkson, but we should -
|" bike to’ add. two iteme: {a) Cn the basis of our recent experiences, it may well
: tarn out to be ‘the case that candidates contacted by Corbisiero through his friende-
in the underworld will be unwilliag during the first contact to give their true sames
. and other data. In fact, this would be normal, and we anticipate the necessity of
Corbisiero‘s revisiting promising candidates to obtain data for tracing purposes
and to make accurate assegaments. {b) We streas quality; if Corbistero returns
from his first search miaston-with only a couple of candidates, we shall not be
disappointed. .Plenty of patience and 4 high degree of selectivity will net us more
in the long run than aiming at quick accomplishmente.

   

 
   
       
         
     
    
   

    

3. As we understood it from Clarkson, Corbisiero will start his search in
Antwerp. Please insure that ke does agi search in France since we have activities
underway there with which he may unwittingly cross wires. We also consider lt
inadvisable that he search in Italy. :

    
       
    

4. We have obligated $1000 for Corbisiero's mission, to include travel
and ops expenses and pay for hie time. More is available if needed. Regarding
the amount of pay, we leave thid up to you and Clarkson on the basis of the time

- spent on the miasion and the extent to which you are satisfied that he made a
conscientious and secure effort. Costs should be charged to KUTUBE/ D, citing
Cost Center 1123-10-1009. ”
