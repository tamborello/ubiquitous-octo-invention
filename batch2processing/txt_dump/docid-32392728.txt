government prosecute Luns for "lying and misleading the
government" on Indonesia during his tenure as foreign
minister. The 19 and 20 January 1972 issues of Dutch paper
De Telegraaf carry articles exposing activities Oltmans who
engaged in denigration campaign against Luns. Stories
accuse Soviets of collusion with Oltmans and of interference
in Dutch internal. affairs. .

d. In 1963 Oltmans was a journalist at the UN
connected with an obscure Dutch newspaper. The other
journalists claimed to never have seen anything of Oltmans!:
in print. While at the UN Oltmans applied for membership |
in the UN correspondence association. However, he could
not produce a single clipping to demonstrate his journalistic
activities: During this time, he gave lectures, earning © soe

_ about $6000 per season, on international politics, touching _
on. Asia in general and Indonesia specifically. He claims ©

to have grown up in Indonesia and therefore knows the condi -
tions there.- ; . ;

- 11. An earlier document dated 1 February 1972 from
the Dutch services provides information relating to Oltmans'
contacts with various Soviet officials including one
Kuznetsov, Cultural Attache in the Soviet Embassy in The
Hague, who, it is believed, may be the same Kuznetzov whom
Oltmans and de Mohrenschildt met in Brussels on 5 March

.1977. <A check of Soviets in Brussels reveals the name of

’ Vladimir Kuznetsov who arrived in Brussels in September 1976.
- (See copy of ONHA 38577, 1 February 1972, under Tab B.)

Vladimir Kuznetsov (201-0943610) is possibly identical wit
Vladimir Sergeyevich Kuznetsov, a GRU staff officer.

12. Although Oltmans may be described as an unscrupulous

-publicity seeker, his contacts with the Soviets (not fully

explained) and de Mohrenschildt add a sinister quality.which,

. MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

“SUBJECT: -. Comments on George de Mohrenschildt (201-155221) —

1. “According to the Warren Commission Report, page 283,

OM, George de Mohrenschildt is a highly individualistic

person of varied interests. He was born in (Mozyr) in the. .
Russian Ukraine in (17 April) 1911 and fled Russia with his
parents in 1921 during the civil disorder following the
revolution. He was in a Polish cavalry military academy for |
11/2 years. Later he studied in Antwerp and attended the
University of Liege from which he received a doctor's degree |.
in international commerce in 1928. Soon thereafter, he emi -
grated to the United States; he became a U.S. citizen in 1949,
De Mohrenschildt eventually became interested in oil explora-
tion and production; he entered the University of Texas in
1944 and received-a master's degree in petroleum geology and ©
petroleum engineering in 1945. He has since become active

as a petroleum engineer throughout the world. In 1960, after

-the death of his son, he and his wife made an 8-month hike
from the United States-Mexican border to Panama over primitive .

jungle trails. By happenstance they were in Guatemala City

‘At the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion. A lengthy film and

complete written log was prepared by de Mohrenschildt and a |
report of the trip was made to the U.S. Government. Upon

‘arriving in Panama they journeyed to Haiti where de Mohren-
‘schildt eventually became involved in a Government-oriented

business venture ‘in which he has been engaged continuously
since June 1963... ." . _ :

2. Somewhat of a non-conformist, de Mohrenschildt was a

peripheral member of the so-called Russian community, in Dallas,

with which Lee Harvey Oswald made contact through Peter Gregory,
a Russian-speaking petroleum engineer whom Oswald met as a
result of his contact with the Texas Employment Commission

office in Fort Worth. Occasional contacts with de Mohrenschildt
and his wife continued until May 1963 when the de Mohrenschildt's ©

went to Haiti. ’

3. There is voluminous material on de Mohrenschildt in -
CIA files, most of it dating from the post-Kennedy assassi-

_ nation period when he testified before the Warren Commission

on his acquaintance with Lee Harvey Oswald and the. latter's
wife. The testimony given by de Mohrenschildt and his wife.
appear in Volume IX of the Hearings before the President's
Commission on: the Assassination of President Kennedy, pages.

7 4. The bulk of the material in Agency.files consists

of FBI reports, the most recent of which is dated 1967. The
FBI has informed CIA that it has no traces. on de Mohrenschildt
beyond that date. (Memorandum no. 76-3000 from the IG to the . .-
Director, 22 September 1976.) ; eo oe

 

; 5. Our files show that a mail cover was placed*on letters
addressed to de Mohrenschildt, c/o the United States Embassy |
. in Haiti, from about 1964 to 1966. This included opening and cs

photographing the contents of some letters by the Station there.
The results of the operations were shared with the FBI..°  ..- ;
(Memorandum no. 76-3000 cited above.) (The genesis of this

mail operation is not readily available. A search is being
made to find it.) . : : ; ao ee

 

6. The most recent information relating to de Mohren-
schildt is correspondence dated 5 September 1976 from him to.
the Director,George Bush. De Mohrenschildt claims that he |
and his wife "find ourselves surrounded by some vigilantes;
our. phone bugged and we are being followed everywhere. Either
the FBI is involved in this or they do not want to accept my
complaints. We are driven to insanity by this situation." |. A
De Mohrenschildt goes on to'ask the Director if he could do :
something "to remove this net.around us." .° 7 ;

7. According toa note from the Director, he had first
met de Mohrenschildt in the early -40's. "He was an uncle to. .
my Andover roommate", The Director has not heard from him
for many years until the letter arrived. The Director res-
ponded to de Mohrenschildt's letter on 28 September 1976.
(A copy of this material. is attached as an enclosure to
Memorandum no. 76-3060 from the IG under Tab A.) a

8. Earlier in 1976, the Agency received information -
from Mr. J. Walton Moore who had been contacted in May and
July 1976 by writers connected with the Reader's Digest,
and with the Dial Press and the Dell Publishing Company. °
Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and Mr. de-

Mohrenschildt. (Moore's reports on these contacts are
attached to the IG Memorandum.) :

“9, De Mohrenschildt appears to have lead an adventurous
and colorful life as a petroleum engineer and businessman.

He is both well and poorly connected, and some of his
associations have raised serious questions. (See paragraph
10 below.). Certainly his relationship with the Oswald's

has caused this Agency and the FBI to spend more time and
energy on him in the past than was necessary. Both the FBI
-and this Agency, however, had dropped their interests in

de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late 1960's. .

10.: One of de Mohrenschildt's more questionable . __
contacts (not covered in his 201 file) has been reported in
the Washington Post and the Washington Star. According to .:
the 31 March 1977 issue of the Star, Willem Oltmans, a Dutch
journalist, began cultivating de Mohrenschildt as a news
source and as a friend some ten years ago. According to ""

Oltmans' file he was born on 10 June 1925 in Huizen, Holland.
He studied at. Yale in 1950 and was expelled for misbehavior -.

(financial problems ?). For a short’ time he worked for the.

United Press and De Telegraff a Dutch newspaper; however, he |
-was fired from beth. In 1956 or 1957 he married an American
‘ground stewardess.- In 1960 he divorced her and in November
'.1961 was living: with a Filipino male. Oltmans. was admitted —
to-the United. States in New York City as a permanent resident  —
on 10 June 1958. ; oe Soe te

- <a, Numerous field reports indicate that in 1956
Oltmans arranged:an introduction for himself to President. .
Sukarno... He then traveled with Sukarno during the President's

trip through Europe in 1956 as the President's guest. Oltmans .
trip’ from Indonesia to the US in Feb 57 was paid by the —
Indonesian government. Indications are that he was being used.
as a.tool by the Indonesian government to carry on propaganda
in the US and atthe UN. ; a, : oo

b.  In-March 1960 Oltmans described himself as anti-—
communist. He stated his views are at best those of a great
admirer of communism and what the communist system represents.
He was described as having excellent contacts with all the
communist-dominated countries, including Cuba.

. c. According to press reports, on 18 December 1962
Oltmans announced he intended to take legal action against
Dutch Foreign Minister J..M..A. H. Luns. Oltmans alleged
that he had been refused "on instructions from Luns" a declara-
tion by the Dutch Embassy in Washington, D. C., that he was
a bona fide journalist working for bona fide newspapers. An...
early 1972 report stated Oltmans was attempting to have the —
