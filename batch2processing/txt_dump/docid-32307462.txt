it was not deemed advisable to interview SCHARFF for
the following reasons:

: SCHARFF is presently Agent in Charge@f the

United States Customs Bureau, Houston, is up in years
and has been a member of the Government Service for a
very long period of time. It has been the experience |
of the Houston Office that SCHARFF is prone to allow :
his mind to wander at times with the ultimate result that '
imagination runs away with him. In addition SCHARFF during
the course of contacts in the past, has prefaced the

: majority of his comments on his own personal opinions

i and is unable to substantiate his personal opinions by “

i actual facts.

}-- on The Houston Division is of the opinion that : |
even though SCHARFF was interviewed under suitable
pretext, he may possibly discuss the interview with
FERTITA, who has been most friendly and cooperative with
the Houston Division and of course this would not be : :
desired by the Houston Division.

 

It is worthy of pointing out that individuals
listed in the Details of this report were interviewed under
suitable pretext and no disclosure was made to any outside
| source that the Bureau was conducting an inquiry relative
t to the MAFIA. .
