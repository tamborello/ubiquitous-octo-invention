TRAINING OF CUBAN MILITARY PERSONNEL

In his 12 November speech,
Raul Castro stated that some
7,000 Cuban students had joined
the armed forces when Fidel Cas-
tro asked for volunteers to
train in the handling of special
weapons. He added that he had
recently attended the graduation
of Cuban students completing
the first phase of instruction
for "antiaircraft missile .
troops."

Available evidence indi-

--most of them probably mili-

departed on the remaining two
vessels. (SECRET—KIMBO)

THE BARGHOORN CASE

The release of Professor
Barghoorn on 16 November, two
days after President Kennedy's
public condemnation of Soviet
behavior, apparently reflected
a decision by the Soviet leaders
to disengage as quickly as pos-
sible from this episode and to
try to minimize the damage to
Soviet-US relations.

Ambassador Kohler believes
the Soviet authorities failed to
anticipate the US reaction to
Barghoorn's arrest and that they
were bewildered and genuinely
alarmed by the volume and in-
tensity of US protests and ac-—
tions, Moscow's terse announce—

ment of Barghoorn's release stated

that in view of the “concern
of high US officials," the So—
viet Government had decided
‘merely to expel him from the
Soviet Union" rather than bring

him to trial on espionage charges.
- Gromyko informed Kohler privately

that this decision was the result
of Khrushchev's personal inter-
vention and requested that this
be brought to the attention of
President Kennedy.

Soviet propaganda has played
down the incident, deplored the
"hue and cry" raised in the US,
and expressed the pious hope that
Washington "will correctly evalu—
ate the good will of the Soviet

Government" in releasing Barghoar.

The Communist World

In Ambassador Kohler's
view, this episode does not
reflect a deliberate decision
to worsen relations with the US
or to jettison the peaceful co-
existence policy and move closer
to Chinese Communist positions.
Although the ambassador acknowl-
edges that Soviet authorities
regard an occasional espionage

case as a useful device for warn-

img the Soviet people against
ummomitored contacts with West-
erners, he feels the primary
motiwe in the Barghoorn affair
was the desire to secure a hos-
tage for I, A. Ivanov, an em-
ployee of the Soviet "Amtorg"
trade organization in New York
who was arrested on 29 October.
Gromyko told Kohler on 16 No-
wember that the USSR expects
that the US Government “will
take the necessary measures"

to release Ivanov.

Moscow's apparent desire
to awoid further damaging pub-
lic exchanges over this case
was evident in Gromyko's "con-
fidemtial" warning to Kohler
that if any US official pub-
Licly attempts to justify Barg-
Rhoorm's behavior, thus casting
doubt on the legitimacy of So-
wiet actions, the USSR "will
reserve the right to publish
materials of the investiga-
tion, including the deposition
ef F. Barghoorn himself." (SE-

CUBA'S NEW COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE LAW

Cuba's draft law on compul-
sory military service, explained
in detail by Raul Castro in a
nationwide broadcast on 12 No-
vember, has far-reaching social
and political ramifications.

It is to be an important new
instrument of control over the
population and a means of "re-
educating" Cubans who have not
yet become adjusted to living
and working in a "socialist"
country.

When Fidel Castro first
announced last July that such a
law would be forthcoming, it was

“in the context of a bitter at-

tack on the remnants of the
Cuban middle class. He said the
law would make Cuba a nation
"more and more of workers and
less and less of parasites” and
ensure that the "sons of today's

parasites do not become tomorrow's

potential lumpen" (his word for
recalcitrants and dissidents,
whatever their class origin.)

In a talk to representatives
of Cuba's central labor organi-
zation on 15 November, Raul
Castro indicated that politically
unreliable Cubans will be im-
pressed into labor battalions
rather than inducted into regular
military units. He expressed
confidence that many "lumpen"
so impressed will be rehabil-

itated.

Raul Castro declared that
the law will not be officially
promulgated for another two or
three weeks. In the interin,
the "people" are to discuss
and "approve" it in meetings
of their "mass organizations."

The draft law makes all
Cuban males between the ages of

22 Nov 63

CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY REVIEW

17 and 45 liable to three years
of active military service.
Women between 17 and 35 who
volunteer will be accepted for
two-year terms. The law states
that an individual may fulfill
his obligations either by serv-
ing full time for three years
or, at the discretion of the
state, as a member of the re-
serves. Students and others
whose civilian duties are judged
to be of sufficient importance
may be assigned to the reserves,
but will nevertheless be re-
quired to take military train-
ing during certain periods of
the year. : 7
The pay for draftees on
active duty is to be a token
"allowance" of only seven pesos
per month--as compared with
the 60 to 80 pesos that the
lowest ranking Cuban soldiers
now receive. Castro justified
this by indicating that all
the draftee's personal needs,
as well as those of any de-
pendents he might have, would
be taken care of by the state.

All eligible Cubans are
to register during the month
of December. Castro estimated
that some 1.5 million Cuban
males will participate in
the initial registration.

His calculations indicate
that approximately: 28,000
are to be called to active
service each year. Thus,
after the program has been’
in effect for three years,
there will be about 84,000
men on active duty under this
program. (CONFIDENTIAL)
