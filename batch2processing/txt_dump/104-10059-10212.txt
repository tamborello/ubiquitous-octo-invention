_ "shortly after" Hunt was appointed to the White House- ~he thinks

_ before the plumber unit was formed, although this is ex post facto.
" reconstruction--Hunt made a request for name traces on Latin ~:.
Ame ricans. He thinks this involved Guatemalans and Costa Ricans.

- one--'"just a few; five, three, two or four." - He enclosed Hunt's
~ request in an envelope and forwarded it with a note that someone.
‘had best check with Tom Karames sines as Hunt was no longer an-

 

a. Jessup is now on TDY at Headquarters and was s interviewed. - me
(7 June by telephone and 8 June in person). He first recalled that |.

 

  
  
 
 
  

I pointed out that Hunt's White House appointment was 6 July 1971. -
As Jessup discussed it he placed the time the last couple of months ©
of 1971 or the first month of 1972. He cannot recall how many name -
traces were involved, but i is certain that the total was more than | ~

Agency employee. Jessup says he didn't know what Hunt was doing .

: or what he had in mind, and was concerned that Hunt might make ©:
' Agency Secret name trace material available to outsiders. J essup! s

office routinely handled a low volume of name trace requests from the . .
NSC Staff, but always i in such instances he knew who it was for and how :
it was to be used, . 4

5. Jessup. said that his office had little other contact with Hunt.

_He saw him in the elevator in EOB once or twice, but never had
. occasion to discuss business matters. Once someone phoned asking ..

for Hunt's telephone extension (which was difficult to get, as the

’ White House switchboard did not give out numbers freely). Out of ©

curiosity he also got Hunt's room number and wandered down (he oe
recalls it as Room 106 EOB) where he found a sign on the door. ;
saying "Plumber, “very much as it. might have said "Janitor. "He:
attached no significance to it.at the time,‘ the term "“Flumber" meaning

- nothing to: him.

6. On one occasion Jessup took his daughter to Blues Alley, and
saw Hunt there with some well-to-do Californians. He thought Hunt
had some association with the place as a public relations man, although

he thinks it would have to be a very small account. I told him of Hunt's

reported interest in jazz, which was news to Jessup. To forestall .
Hunt's thinking that he (Jessup) might be playing around with teenagers
he took his daughter over to introduce her. His daughter felt that
Hunt was a man very pleased with himself. Jessup had no other
recollections. OO

(received i in of IG on 6 J une) stating that Howard Hunt,

. This was hadled orally and by telephone I advised the
_ chief of the appropriate division that they were being
forwarded and to consult with the DDP about the
propriety of responding. I also telephoned the DDP. .
I then wrote my own memo to General HAIG calling =
his attention to the fact that an individual--I named - ;

to the NSC Staff, mn _ :

Haig is s reported by Jessup : as 5 returning the memorandum with, the
word "thanks" noted on its face. | :

of transaction, and that a’search of the files does not disclose a,
copy of the memorandum to General Haig. Mrs. Evelyn De Pue
(Jessup's secretary at the time and now Ratliffe's) spoke with Mrs.
at Headquarters, who reported a memorandum from
