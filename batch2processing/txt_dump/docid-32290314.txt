: .Legat, Mexico City. is of the opinion tha€
conditions conducive to a direct approach to GUTIERREZ"
relative to this matter have not been obtained. Due™

to the sensitive. nature of circumstances relating to .
this case, it is not wise:to attempt an indirect approach :

to GUTIERREZ through other contacts as suggested by chicaso (MIA,

- ‘ In addition, the results of previous discussions
with GUTIERREZ BARRIOS on this subject have been reported to
the Bureau and Chicago. In Mexico City letter dated 11-5-74,
GUTIERREZ BARRIOS is quoted as stating that deportation
action was taken against subject -because the subject was
illegally in Mexico and that this action was not based on |
any activities of a criminal nature which might be considered
in violation of Mexican law. At one point, GUTIERREZ BARRIOS : ;
-explained the deportation by saying simply that the subject's : be
_papers were not in order. Since GUTIERREZ BARRIOS. retains
a high position ‘in the Mexican Government. and has previously
- furnished an account of the reasons supporting the deportation
action against subject, it is doubtful. that he would furnish ©
any substantially different information at this time to this
office or any other Embassy representative. PID “.
