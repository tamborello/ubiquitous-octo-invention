briefly with ROSSELLI in the steam room area, and ROSSELLI
immediately asked informant if he had seen "that guy"
(meaning GEORGE SEEDMAN, for whom informant may work in
connection with SEEDMAN's vending machine operation).
ROSSELLI immediately started telling informant what informant
should tell SEEDMAN and again requested informant to find

out all he could about SEEDMAN. uo

Thereafter, FRIEDMAN and ROSSELLI went into the
cocktail lounge at the Friar's Club and joined the unknown
man mentioned above.

\ On 12/14/62 LA 4268-cC advised that on the previous
day, 12/13/62, he observed ROSSELLI at the Friar's Club at
about five o'clock playing cards with an individual named
ALEXANDER RUDOLPH. ROSSELLI was losing money and FRIEDMAN
took his place and shortly after "got ROSSELLI even."

Informant learned that JOSEPH I. BREEN, JR., a
close friend and business associate of ROSSELLI, is currently
writing and directing a Biblical picture. Informant did not
know for whom he was working or the name of the picture.

Informant advised that at about 6 p.m. on 12/13/62
MILTON BERLE, JACK BENNY, and GEORGE BURNS, well-known enter-
tainers, arrived at the Friar's Club and a photographer took
eolored pictures of them seated in the cocktail lounge. They
then went into the dining room where another group colored
picture was taken at which time the doors were open into the
gambling room, Included in this latter picture were ROSSELLI
and FRIEDMAN playing cards. The purpose of the pictures was
apparently to show that celebrities belong to the club, and

the club intends to make colored post cards of these pictures.

After the pictures were taken MILTON BERLE told
informant that he was going to Las Vegas in the near future
with Dodger baseball players, DRYSDALE, KOUFAX, MAURY WILLS,
and HOWARD, where these ball players would appear in an act
in one of the hotels, which act would be built around MILTON
BERLE.
