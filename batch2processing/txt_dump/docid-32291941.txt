advised that AUSA JAMES B., WHITE, SDNY, was apparently
still considering prosecution of ALDERISIO on the
SEGAL threats.

‘Reference Chicago airtel to Miami, dated
\ 11/1/63:

The Chicago Office is requested to attempt
to.locate the current address of MORRIE LITBERG since
it appears that he, too, was threatened by ALDERISIO.

“in 1960 or 1961.

 

ALDERISIO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS
SINCE HE IS ALLEGED TO CARRY A GUN _IN A SHOULDER HOLSTER. on
TRAFFICANTE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS, ;
DUE_-TO HIS PAST ASSOCIATIONS IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES.
