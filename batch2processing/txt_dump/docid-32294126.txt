RE: THE CLIQUE a . an
Kansas City, Missouri . : :

: Informant related that under CIVELLA is a group
of men who control the activities of "The Clique".and who set
the policy of operation. He advised that-there is no special
name given. ‘to this group of men and it is their job to handlé
gambling, labor, etc. Each man-has his own followers and ‘in
turn these individuals are responsible to only. one man but they.
can be used by the other leaders if necessary. Any robbery, .
burglary or other type of criminal act must be cleared first _
by the individuals léader and if a crime is committed without .
this approval the individual man may be: made to return whatever |
he had stolen and if he failed to heed the warning he ‘could be
killed. ,The leaders of this group only report to NICK CIVELLA |
and if a problem arises that requires a higher decision, CIVELLA
.will then take this matter up with "The Men at the Bakery.” rood
This procedure is followed right down the line~to where hustlers
and sneak thieves have. to ask permission. He stated that this
is chow "The Clique" controls all of the men in their group.

 

Informant advised that he has never heard the
“term, "our .friend", or "my friend", used as he was instructed
never to identify anyone as being connected with "The Clique."
He stated that he was never made a member ‘of "The Clique" and, .
. therefore, is unable to have any knowledge of terms used after :
. a person becomes a member. He stated: that he knew that in order
to be a member of "The Clique" you did have to have a Godfather .
to’sponsor you but he Has no knowledge of any other requirements oo
or ritual pertaining to the initiation, He added that those ,
connected with this group all grew up together in the same
neighborhood, attended school together, hung around together
and so you were always "on trial" and being watched in every=
thing you did or said. sos

Informant stated that he was ‘close to NICK CIVELLA
and only had'to report to him and this was based on the fact
that his father was a very close friend of ."The Mén at the Bakery."
Informant stated that he has never heard any of the members called i
"soldiers" nor has he heard the term of “caporegime" or the term
"button men" used. : :

  
   
   
  
 

hat several years ago he was
nd a stranger joined in the group.

er identified to the Informant as
VITALE, but he was not introduced {

_- : Informant stated.
playing golf with NICK CIVELLA
He stated that this man was la
"The Man". from St. Louis, JO}

to him. \Informant further stated that on several occasions he
saw TON CARDOJof Chicago in the company of. NICK CIVELLA, but

again hé was not introduced to ACCARDO and he, ACCARDO, was
identified to him as "The Man" from Chicago. He stated that
several months after the Apalachin meeting he was told that JOE
FILARDO and NICK CIVELLA had attended the Apalachin meeting.
Informant said that "they" only told. you what they wanted you to
know and you never ask questions.

“fle stated: that JOE CUSUMANO was the Godfather of ©
his brother and that is, why the close ties existed between the
Informant and "The Men at the Bakery. " . !

Informant stated that ‘he has reviewed and heard
on television the accounts of the testimony given by JOE VALACHI
and he feels that because CIVELLA and FILARDO attended the
Apalachin meeting there must be some connection between "The
Clique" and the Cosa Nostra as described by VALACHI. He
stated that he has no evidence whatsoever to prove that there
is such a connection, nor was he ever given any information to
indicate that members of both organizations associated with each
other except for the visits of VITALE and ACCARDO.. He added
that there is no doubt in his mind that if the members of the
Kansas City group were called upon for assistance by members
of the Cosa Nostra that such assistance and cooperation would -
be given.
