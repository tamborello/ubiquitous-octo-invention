Dear Mr. Chairman: JPA AREF EY [ivb=

I am writing to make you aware of the efforts of the
FBI to release documents pursuant to the John F. Kennedy (JFK)
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (the Act).: During
the November 17, 1993, hearing of the House Government Operations
Committee (HGOC), concerns were raised regarding the FBI's
response to the Act, and I want to ensure that you and other
members of the Committee are fully informed regarding the scope
and status of that response. It is particularly important that
you have this information in view of claims that the FBI is
"stonewalling" with respect to a document release that appeared
in a November 18, 1993, article in "The Washington Post."

The FBI has in excess of 1,000,000 pages of documents
subject to release to the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA). These documents, a very large number of
which are duplicates, appear in various files, to include those
relating to the JFK Assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack Ruby,
the Warren Commission, and the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA). In addition to processing these
"originals" and "duplicates," the FBI is, of course, preparing
identification aids for each document to be released.
