Fury sedan, black bottom and white top, Florida license # 1w22076,

Gambling in New Kensington, Pa., remains very slow, much to the
distress of the MANNARINOs and their underlings. Gamblers are
frequently heard to opine that after the General Elections in
November, 1961, the MANNARINOs will be able to "get to" the

new Mayor and things will open up again. OTHER 4

SAMUEL and GABRIEL MANNARINO, whan in town, continue to eat lunch almod
daily at the Bonfire Restaurant, Leechburg Road, Allegheny Township,

Westmoreland County, Pa., and they invariably bring visitors and
guests to this establishment. .

Miami will obtain holder of Florida license # 1W22076.
BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
