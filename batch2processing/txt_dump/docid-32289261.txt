that he had gotten in touch with LOU and had calmed him

down, and that if the informant straightened things out

now everything would be okay. But if he did not, he would
‘ get hurt. Well get him."

Informant: advised that on October 14, 1958,

knowing that BENNIE BERNARD was on federal probation, he made a
telephone call to the United States Probation Office,
Chicago, Illinois, determined that a Probation; Officer by

the name of WITMORE was in charge of BERNARD's probation, ~~
and he told WITMORE that. BENNIE BERNARD had come to his store
- on several occasions, had nade threats to his wife, attempted
to force the employees to keep the store closed, and made
threats against his person. ‘Informant advised that he did
not give WITMORE all of the details as to the reason the
threats were made ..

Informant advised that on October 14, 1958, his

wife advised him that a probation officer by the name of

'. WITMORE had appeared at the grocery store during the afternoon
of October 14, 1958, and had BENNIE BERNARD withhim. The
probation officer interviewed the informant's wife in BERNARD" s
presence and asked if the allegations were true, at which |
time BERNARD budded in and said, "All I said to her was if
(the informant)doesn't pay the $6200 back we're going to get
him and he'll get hurt.” Informant advised that his wife”
told the ‘probation officer that she was distraight and was

: inno frame of mind to answer further questions. Informant
advised that since that time, neither BERNARD nor TORNABENE
appeared at the store. However, the windows in the grocery
store were all smashed over the last weekend.

~ On. November 6, 1958, the inbrmant' contacted the
Chicago. Office of the FBI and advised | that he had” been ‘in
Newark contacting hoodlum connections, and had also been to
‘New York City, where he contacted various peoplé in an “éffort
to straighten out his situation. He advised that he felt”
sufficient pressure had been brought to bear by the New. York
connections and he had been told to return andm ‘haim would
be done to him and that, the, matter with TORNABENE chad been:
settled.

The informant supplied the @llowing information ~~

October 16, 1958, he made his first contact with one

PETE LE BLANC in "Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey. He advised
that during: the time that he ran gambling operations ‘in

New Jersey. himself, he became well acquainted with PETE

LE BLANC, as LE BLANC had been: an active member at that

time in-the Moretti, Addonis'& Anastasia Gang. He advised
that MORETTI, ADDONIS and ANASTASIA, of course, are now

dead and that. ‘PETE LE BLANC has ‘taken over in that section
of Jersey. He advised, however, that LE BLANC is, in effect,
a powerful man in himself; however, he no longer has any
organization behind him due to the fact that the Bergan
County area in New Jersey is pretty well cleaned up
regarding. gambling and numbers, due to the extreme pressure.
which. had been brought to bear by. States Attorneys and police
in that area. LE BLANC advised him that he no longer could

use a telephone and he was reluctant to make contacts with

other known hoodlums in the immediate area, due to the fact
that the FBI was conducting extensive investigation and was
apparently worrying them a great deal. Informant advised
that LE BLANC told him that he would take the matter into
consideration and that he might consider a trip to Chicago

‘to contact the proper authorities and plead the informant's
‘case. Informant advised that after a sufficient length of

time it became apparent to him that LE BLANC was going to
take no action. Informant advised thatthe meet with LE BLANC
was at the offices of an attorney, N. CORELLA, at the corner
of Second and Summit, Lindhurst, New Jersey. He advised

that CORELLA had set up the meet between himself and LE BLANC,

Informant advised that after it had bécome
apparent to him that LE BLANC was not the answer to his”
problem, he mved into the Newark area, and on about October
23, 1958,:he contacted one TONY BANANAS (described as white
male, age 40s, 6°, 185-90 pounds, well built, athletic,
Italian), at Dot's Restaurant on Route 10, about 15 miles
west of Newark. He advised that ‘this restaurant is fre-.

quented by hoodlums in the area and TONY had selected it as

a meeting place. According to the informant, TONY BANANAS'
sphere of influence is in Newark and he controls a good
measure of the ‘gambling occurring in the area. He advised
that TONY is well placed in the syndicate and is considered
an extremely powerful. man.

East Coast. The informant advised that he had planned
toe take a trip to the East in order to settle the whole
dispute; however, the $6,000.00 came into his hands before
-he had time to make arrangements to go East. He advised
- that he was. positive, that he would be able to straighten
.the entire situation out because he recontacted his associates
in New York and New Jersey and felt that there was a minimum
of risk in. holding out the money on TORNABENE.

Informant advised that he contacted TORNABENE
and told him that he would,.under no circumstances, pay him
any money, after which he. decided that he should immediately
leave Chicago and make the. necessary contacts in Newark and
New York to back up the threats which he had made to TORNABENE.

On October 14, 1958, informant advised that since
he had departed from Chicago, he had been in daily contact
with his wife who advised him that at about 1:00 p.m. on
Saturday, October 11, 1958, LOUIS TORNABENE and BENNIE BERNARD,
notorious Chicago cartage thief, came into their gocery store
and asked for the informant. The informant said that these
two individuals told his wife, "I want you to know that your
husband has $6200.00 of ours and we want it ~ if he doesn't
come up with it we'll kill him." ‘Informant advised that it
was LOUIS TORNABENE who made the above statements. At about
6:30 p.m. on the same day, both TORNABENE and BERNARD again
appeared at the store and told a young. ‘male employee; = =<
Dk -not to open the store on Sunday. The informant —
advised that on Saturday night his wife had contacted the
Maxwell District, Chicago Police Department, advised that”
she had been threatened, and asked: for a police escort home,
and again in the morning to work. , Inférmant: advised that no
details were supplied to the police; however, one Lieutenant ©
GORE, who is known to the informant, apparently for friendship
sake, caused informant's ) wife to be escorted to and,from the
store. Informant advised that on Sunday, the T2th, at about
10:30 a.m., BENNIE BERNARD appeared at the store. ‘Informant
advised that LOUIS TORNABENE never made a re-appearance at
the store after Saturday, the llth. BENNIE BERNARD - ‘on Sunday
stated "You know. if he doesn't get that money up; no matter
where he goes we have connections. We'll get him and kill’

CG T-3 advised that LOUIE BRIATTA is the man
under ALEX, who has organized the gamblers in the Loop and

.who keeps them in'line. He said that under BRIATTA are’

many underlings who constantly visit ‘the bookies to insure
that ALEX's interests are well ‘provided for and that no
one is crossing him. He identified one SID. FRASER as
being one of these underlings.

CG T-3 stated that years ago, men like JOHN LYNCH,
MAL CLARKE, GEORGE LEIDERMAN and EDWARD DOBKINS were the
“big bookies" in the Loop but that within the pat several
years the syndicate. has "pushed" these men more and more
until all of them decided that: it was not worth it anymore
and left the business in Chicago. Now, he said, the gamblers
in the Loop are almost entirely "dagos" and very few have
the personal integrity and good will. which the old tiners
had.

CG T-1 advised, as previously reported, that Gus
ALEX interceeded in a dispute between LOUIS TORNABENE,
notorious Chicago handbook. operator andthe informant, by
taking TORNABENE's side in settling the matter in favor of
TORNABENE. CG T-1 stated that ALEX's influence was sufficient
fo overcome the influence of SAM BATTAGLIA and other highly
placed hocdlums, who sided with the infdrmant, probably due
to ALEX’s control of the first ward, the area which CG T=-1
stated ALEX controls for the crime syndicate in Chicago. The

_ informant has now furnished additional information concerning

this dispute regarding the role played in it by ALEX, as
follows:

On October 10, 1958, CG T=-1 stated that he had ~
gone out to collect a gambling ‘debt of $6,000,00, ‘which was”
owed to himself and LOUIS TORNABENE, The informant explained
that he had taken the bet from an individual unknown to
LOUIS TORNABENE,. The individual lost and, therefore, owed
the sum of $6,000.00 to himsélf and LOUIS TORNABENE; The

_ informant advised that in his opinion he had been muscled’ out

of money honestly owed to him by TORNABENE and, therefore, took
it upon himself to keep the $6,000.00 and not’ turn over
TORNABENE's share to him. The informant advised that he
telephoned TORNABENE and told him that he planned to keep the

‘money, as he felt that the money was due him and that if

TORNABENE had any ideas otherwise, that the informant would
take the entire matter up with hoodlum contacts of his on the

a partner of his in a gambling operation located in the Santa
Fe Hotel on the corner of Polk and Dearborn, Chicago, and that
‘TORNABENE had cheated him out of a total of approximately ~
$19,000.00. He stated that in order to arbitrate this dispute
he went to SAM BATTAGLIA, a high level syndicate hoodlum, who
in turn met with a representative of GUS ALEX's in order to

' He ‘also advised that BERTUCCI is carried on the payroll of

the city of Chicago. but that. he does not work for the city of

Chicago even though he receives $100.00 a week from the city.

CG T=1 advised that on November 18, 1958, he was
contacted and advised to meet GUS ALEX and his Lieutenant,
FRANK FERRARO, at the Normandy Bar, across the streét from

‘City Hall, in Chicago. He stated that he met ALEX and FERRARO

and that after advising ALEX of his side in the dispute with
TORNABENE, ALEX placed a call for TORNABENE. to join them
immediately. He stated that when. TORNABENE arrived at the
Normandy Bar, he was accompanied. by “CHAPPIE" BERTUCCI, who OBL
stayed outside in the car when TORNABENE came inside. ;

CG T=3 dvised that during the past several
years one GEORGE MLE TDERMAN was a ‘well known bookmaker, who

ee Gperated on a large scale in the Loop. -He stated: that in

Vv

the late 1940's, LEIDERMAN took a bet from a better located
in the Southwestern portion of the United States. This better
lost and was unable to pay off LEIDERMAN. . LEIDERMAN there-
fore accepted ownership in an oil. well in Texas or Oklahoma
owned by the better. Several months later the well produced
sufficient oil to make a millionaire out of LEIDERMAN. Later,
largely as a result of the Kefauver hearings, LEIDERMAN left
the gambling business and now has an office as 188 Randolph
where he deals in oil.

It is noted that in approximately May, 1958, while
SA ROEMER was surveilling GUS ALEX in the Randolph Towers
barber shop, 188 Randolph, a well dressed man entered the
shop and was addressed by what SA ROEMER felt was Mr. LEBERMAN
(PH) by a barber. ALEX immediately called to the man "GEORGE
come here".. It is believed this must have been LEIDERMAN,
whom the informant described above. He was approximately
50 years old, tall, medium=-heavy build, dark hair. .

On December 10, 1958, it was observed that the
building directory at 188 Randolph listed GEORGE LEIDERMAN
in suite 620-627, When questioned as to the assdéciation’~
between LEIDERMAN and ALEX, informant stated that’ he knows
of none directly but due to LEIDERMAN'’s prominence in the
Loop, certainly figures that he is acquainted with ALEX.
