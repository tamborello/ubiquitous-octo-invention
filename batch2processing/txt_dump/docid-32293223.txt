A survey was conducted by SA NATHAN O, BROWN |

of the Holiday Inn, Isfayette, Louisiana, on 6/12/64. This © i

survey developed that the subject uses a twin room on his
visits to the motel and that each of these rooms butts
against another twin room. There is a telephone conduit ©
connection on one side of each room which will afford

direct air space between these units and is readily adaptable
for use of a mite pre-amplifier unit.

 

The ceilings in the motel are dropped, acoustical
tile suspended by wire from rafters, the tile being tongue

and groove and cannot be individually removed. Access can
be gained to the space above the tile and an installation/<

made there.

    

The walls are-of cement block and use of a
contact microphone would not be possible. :

It would appear that no satisfactory installation
can be made without a degree of trespass and in view of the
forthcoming trial of MARCELLO scheduled for August, 1964 in
U. S. District Court as well as the fact that he makes :
rather infrequent visits to Lafayette, it is not believed al
installation should be contemplated at this time. In the . i

 

event it is felt that an installation is desirable a request:
will be made of the Bureau at that time.
