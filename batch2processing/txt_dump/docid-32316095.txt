SA LEON F, ANDREWS, JR., and advised that this office was
attempting to determine if STEVE MAGADDINO was then in
Niagara Falls, New York,.

It. is noted that CORNETTA for several years worked
for the United States Buréau of Narcotics in Sicily and in
New York City and is familiar with the activities of hoodlums
engaged in narcotics activities in the New York City area.
CORNETTA speaks the Sicilian language fluently. CORNFTTA
telephonically contacted the residence of STEVE MAGADDINO
in Niagara Falls, New York, under a pretext of being Mr. COSTA
from Italy who had been asked to contact MAGADDINO upon his
arrival in this country. “ORNETTA stated that a woman who
appeared to be Mrs, STEVE ¥ «DDINOinformed him that she did
not know a Mr, COSTA and refused to furnish any information
as to whether or not STEVE MAGADDINO was at home at-

‘that time, Pretext calls were also made to the Magaddino
Memorial Chapel by FRED CORNETTA without determining the
whereabouts of MAGADDINO. ‘ ;

STEVE MAGADDINO at the Magaddino Memorial Chapel at 3:03 p.m,
that day. At that time STEVE MAGADDINO engaged PETER A,
MAGADDINO, his son, in a conversation all of which was in
the Sicilian language. The conversation between PETER A,
MAGADDINO and STEVE MAGADDINO was interrupted upon the

it would appear that MAGADDINO was discussing the problems
arising out of the death of JOSEPH PROFACI in New York City.
