proposed plans and he was instructed not to use AMTURVY-13 in any of
his operations in our behalf, In an SW message dated 11 March 1964,
AMCROAK-1 responded that he had "forgotten about the AMTURVY-13 matter",
leading WAVE to believe that he had disassociated himself from
AMTURVY~13 and his proposed plot. AMTURVY-13 was never mentioned

again in any correspondence received from AMCROAK-1, Since that time
all of AMCROAK-1's messages contained positive intelligence and
operational matters only. No further mention of AMTURVY-13 was ever
made in his messages, However, in view of the information contained

in paragraph 2 of Reference A, WAVE believes that this could be the
reason for AMCROAK-1's compromise, It is believed that AMCROAK~1 was
arrested because of his own indiscretion and because he did not heed
our instructions to keep away from AMTURVY-13.

1, The Subject mentioned in paragraph 1 of Reference A, who was
reportedly arrested in late June or early July 1965, is known to WAVE
as AMTURVY-13. The Subject mentioned in paragraph 2 of Reference A,
who alle edly orew tp the plans and r ceived
spe isa former WAVE asset AMCROAK-1, who was
apparently arrested sometime in late April or early May 1965.

PX 2. At the time of AMCROAK-1's recruitment in Madrid, Spain, in
December 1963, AMCROAK-1 discussed a plan concerning the_physical ~
elimination of GOC officials with the WAVE Recruiting Officer, see
Reference C,. During the course of this discussion the WAVE Recruiting
Officer learned that AMTURVY-13 was one of the principal conspirators
involved in the plot and that the plotters claimed to possess the
weapons and ammunition to perpetrate the dead. All they required was
35,000 pesos in order to.obtain a truck, two automobiles and places to
hide after the attempt was made, The WAVE Recruiting Officer told
AMCROAK-1 that QDYOKE did_not condone such attempts and no commitments
were made to AMCROAK~1 insofar as supporting the plot was_
concerned, No weapons of any kind were ever sent to =1L.

iP? 3. Upon returning to Cuba, following his recruitment, AMCROAK-1

/~ submitted several persistent requests for funds-to purchase two ———
automobiles, Since OAK~1 said in Madrid that two automobiles were
fequired to carry out the plan mentioned in paragraph 2 above, it was
suspected that AMCROAK-1 was still involved in this matter, Therefore,
he was told that WAVE would be willing to provide the funds for one

car for his operational use but not for two, He was also told to
remember the discussions in Madrid, that we did not condone AMTURVY-13'g
