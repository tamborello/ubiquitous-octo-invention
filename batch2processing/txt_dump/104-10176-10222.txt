1. Forwarded herewith for Heacauarters information and
files is am Agent Service Record or LIRING-3.

2. As Addressees are aware. valiace P. RAWTON recruttred
and formerly handled LIRING-3 for the Hexico City Station.
Prior to ROsTON's PCS departure from Mexico City in July 1969,
it was deciced, after some discussion, to effect a turnover of
LIRING-3, rather than terminate him, Although LIRIkG-3 apparently
| had been well "burned" with the Cubans, he seemed to have maintai:ed
| goed contacts with members of the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) of
[ Guatemala, [!n addition, in May and June of this year, he had
fi begun tc deveion access to same Pansmanisén revolutionaries of
t interest. It was therefore decided to rur- LIRING-3 on a triat
Wf besis to determine whether he could be used effectively against
“ Central American revolutionary targets, despite his problems with
the Cubans. :
i
3. ROVTON Introduced Leonard S$. TORMET, in alias, to LIRING-3_
on I duly 1969, Although ROHTON had represented himself to LIRIKG-3
as @ Greek tusinessman, it was decided that it would be preferable
to “clear the air” somewhat with LIRING-3, at least by making it

clear that he was in touch with a WOLADY orzanization. Nonethe-
less, no specific exalaration was given LIRING-3 of his soonsor
and he requested none. LIRING-3 was told tnat TORMET would be
seeing him for some months, since ROWTON was leaving the country
for an indefinite period. i

&, LIRING-3 was told that although TORMET was trusted by
ROWTON and collaborated with him, he represented a different
organization. LIRING-3 was also told that although he had jn the
past been receiving between 3,000.00 and 3,520.00 Mexican’ peses
per month on an informal basis, TORMET's organization feit that
1,500 Mexican pesos per month ($120.00) woulc te a fair salary at
this stage of the operation. TORMT explained that he was eware
of LIRIKG-3's past activities directed against tre Cubans, and the
resultant problems which had arisen. It was explained that
TOAKET's interest was in Central American revolutionary activities.
In orcer to deal with LIRING-3's virtua! "“burneo" status with the
Cubans, he was directed to tell any Central American contacts that
the Cubans no longer trusted him, and that he tnerefore was no
longer directly involvec with any revolutionary groups or activities.
Nonetheless, LIRING-3 was directed to offer any assistance which
ne couia proviue Co eny FevolULIONartes, ON Lit Ladsis UI tis
leftist beliefs and the friendships which he had made with FAR
members while in oriscn in Guatemala. It would then be a matter
of time before we could learn whether LIRING-2 «2s complete i+
blacklisted in all revolutionary circles beca':se of his proviems
with the Cubans or whether he could provide information of value.

 

5. LIRING-3 throughout the meeting seemed in good spirits -
and he seemed to accep~ the turnover without any qualms. . Inceed,
he pointed out that the Cubans had lost trust in him only after
he had been given various tasks to co by ROWTON which he had known
and warned in advance would cause suspicion. it was agreed that
LIRING-3's troubles were not of his own making, but that ‘at this
stage all that could te done was to attempt to circumvent the
existing problems. i
H

6 LIRING-3 was given a Station non-attributeble telephone
number and false name to ask for (identity) to set up meetings
with TORMET. Only the meeting time was to be set by phone, and
a@ prearranged cickup point was decided upon. It should be noted
that TORMET's QP vehicle was used for this first meeting with
LIRING-3, which means it was of course exposed to LIRENG-3.

J. Subsequent to this meeting, LIRING-3 never initiated
contact with the Station. Although he might have lost the new
telephone number he was given to use with TORMET, there is no
Indication he ever again tried to call ROWTON, who was im Mexico
for at least three weeks after the | July turnover to TORMET.

8. The Station assumes that for whatever reasons, iirine-3
has in effect terminated himself. Given the nature of this case--
the fact that LIRING-3 was denounced in Cuban official circles as
@ RVROCK agent, the fact that LIRING-3 in over two years was never
very productive and-now the apparent decision of LIRING-3 to break

contact with him. . . :
