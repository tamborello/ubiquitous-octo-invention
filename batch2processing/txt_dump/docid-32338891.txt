ND BOS T+S ‘215-was present with LAWSON at 5:00° |
P.M. on November 23, 1949,. when the latter reported
to SHAPLEY the results of his conference with CHAFFEE.

LAWSON stated that he had had a satisfactory. conference i
with CHAFFEE and that CHAFFEE expressed a willingness

to assist in the preparation of a brief amicus: curiae

to the Supreme Court of the United States in the case

involving the "Hollywood Ten." CHAPFEE had further in-

dicated his willingness to sign such a brief as a

faculty member of the Harvard Law School, He conditioned

these offers, however, on the brief being filed under

the auspices of the AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION ané,

further, upon LAWSON'S obtaining the signatures and .

assistance of OSMOND PRANKO (phorietic:)) and ARTHUR GARFIELD

HAYES. CHAFFEE was unwilling to assoelate himself in

such & matter with the NCASP. LAWSON also stated that

hé was attempting to have still another brief filed by .
educators and a third by publishers, and that D. ANGUS Yy
CANSROW hed promised’to assist in the publishers! brief.

ND BOS T-S 215 learned from LAWSON that the. latter

“had, on the afternoon of November 22, 1949, made.a two-hour

speech before the Student Lawyers Guild at the Harvard Law
School. LAWSON said that his presence had created a
considerable "fuss", and that the chairman of ‘the Guild

head resigned rather: than. preside at a meeting addressed

by him. Nevertheless, the students had voted overwhelmingly
to hear LAWSON. LAWSON reported that the students were
divided "to some extent" about the pros and cons.of the
case,’ and appeared to be principally interested cin the

presented by the suggested matter ."

. legal technicalities rather than in 4 “issues

LAWSON also appeared publicly at the special meeting
of the Comunity Church held at 565 Boylston Street, —

NCASF, according to ND BOS.525. ‘The Community chureh
meeting was attended by Confidential Informants ND BOS
21 and 559.0on November 23, 1949. Aocording.to these

Informants, LAWSON'S speech was as follows: °

me He said-that he was speaking in Boston, New York
t and. Philadelphia, while other members of the "Hollywood
Ten" were visiting other cities in the U.S. All speakers
| i were attempting to acquaint the population with the.
& real meaning of the trial of the "Ten." He asserted:
, that only two of the ten stood trial under ean agreement
{ whereby the remaining eight accepted the judgment reached
: ‘with reference to the two, LAWSON asserted that he was
one of the two who did stand trial and that the atmosphere
of the court room was depressing and tense, like a Kasi
court room immediately prior to World War-II. He digressed
to criticize the Government of the: United States for:
deporting & German, ‘one BERTHOLDT BROCK, after the latter
hed obtained sanctuary from two Fascist persecutions in. -
Europe. a coe ae a

 

: » Reverting to the trial, he stated that the jury

was selected in an unusual ‘and unfair manner, The jurors .
sat in the audience in the rear 6f the court room: they i
were questioned collectively, and. over the heads of the -
| audience and. responded collectively. The defendant was
-. not afforded an opportunity to challenge. the jurors. When :
1 the trial began, the jury heard only-the opening statements i
‘ and the closing arguments and nothing of that which had
transpired in the interim.. The jury was made up partially
of Government employees who ,could not remain impartial.
and maintain their positions. BE Fe
