POLIZZI's whereabouts and advised informant that POLIZZI
had not yet contacted them relative to the new Los Angeles
LCN "Boss."

On 9/30/67, informant advised that POLIZZI had
telephonically contacted him the night of 9/29/67. POLIZZI
stated that he-had suffered a stroke and had been hospitalized
for about the past 10 days. Informant met POLIZZI in
POLIZZI's room at Mt. Sinai Hospital, LasAngeles, California
on the night of 9/29/67. POLIZZI stated that he is recovering
from this stroke and expects to be discharged from the
hospital in several days. :

At this time, POLIZZI asked informant if informant
had made his choice relative to the new Los Angeles LCN
"Boss." Informant stated that his preference would be NICK
LICATA, but that he would support POLIZZI and would vote

for the individual who was the choice of POLIZZI.

POLIZZI stated that his choice would be LICATA
as POLIZZI felt that this was no time for any change in
the Los Angeles LCN leadership. POLIZZI indicated that
continued pressure from law enforcement would make it
difficult to meet and to reorganize at the present time.

POLIZZI stated that to date there had been no
opposition to LICATA, POLIZZI stated that except for informant
he had not had a chance as yet to poll other "members"
of his "Regime", but felt that there would be general
agreement to LICATA's selection.

POLIZZI requested informant to contact DOMINIC
"MIMI" TRIPOLI, JOSEPH GIAMMONA and ANTHONY MANGIONE and
advise them of his illness and that he would be in contact
with them when he was able.

On 10/4/67, informant advised that POLIZZI had
been discharged from the hospital on 10/2/67, and was
presently recuperating at home. POLIZZI advised informant
on that date that his doctor wanted him to recuperate at
home and restrict his activities for the next four to eight
weeks. : : :
