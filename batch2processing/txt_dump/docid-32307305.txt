stated that he continued in business OTHER 4°;
despite these threats. The next step against him was .
the destruction of some of his equipment at the following
locations:

Half Moon Tavern, Route 64, second tavern
west of city limits of St. Charles;

Club Moderne, Alternate 30, two miles
east of. Geneva; :

Peter De King, Jr., Route 25, Aurora Avenue,
North of Aurora. - .
. At these locations two men entered with one
wielding a gun and one an ax. While the location owners '
were menaced with the gun their equipment was demolished
with an ax, resulting in a, total loss of one pool game,
one shuffle alley, and three pin ballmmachines. He
said at the Half Moon Tavern this incident was witnessed
“by the: wife of BERNARD BAILEY, who owned the tavern at
that time, and by BAILEY's partner, HARRY, last name Y
unknown, and his wife. , At the Club Moderne only the
wife of STANLEY PATEK was a witness to the axing. At
Peter De King's tavern, he was not certain as to the
witnesses. . He was of the opinion that the. damage
' done to these machines was over a period of about ten
days during early 1957. He specifically recalled that
the damage to PETER DE KING was done on a Sunday night.

[___] stated he knew PRANO under the name of
ROCKY. MARTEL until the time of his arrest, when he used
the name of PRANO. He stated he had also used the :
name of ROCKY BARTEL. <

the Kane County Grand Jury, but no action has been taken.

LC] stated that he has been subpoenaed by
the Senate Select Committee, and while he is not happy

Leer! Stated they drove around various roads
including York Road where he had heard gangsters had been
"taken for a ride". stated this made him still more
uneasy, and he decided to give the appearance of "going
along" with any suggestions they would make. He said the
"boss" asked him how many jukeboxes he had, and POSS told
him and then was told by the boss, "We're going to make
you a lot of money with books and slots." He said in
order to stall them off he told them he could not give
them a definite answer then as he was going to the lakes
for three days and for them to see him upon his return
next Tuesday to discuss the matter further. He said that
he was not harmed on the ride and was returned to his
automobile.

Upon returning to Aurora, he immediately called

Sheriff HOWARD KELLETT and told him of his recent ride,
and asked advice as to how to cope with the situation.
Between them it was decided to tell the "musclemen" that
he had a silent partner who would not go for: their deal
and that, therefore, it was all off. At this point, Mr.

was shown several photographs and he picked, out ‘the
photograph of SAM GIANCANA as closely resembling the
"boss'"' when he was taken on a ride. He said PRANO
did return to his office and was advised as stated above.
He stated that after this he was visited by RALPH KELLY
of Elgin, Illinois, who t im he hated to 'do this but
it was an order that he, pt get out of business.

Shortly thereafter CLARENCE LAMBERT, 75 South
Chestnut, Aurora, came to his home with a similar type
message. [___] stated he had made no effort ‘to go out
of business and had no further trouble until several
puesks, tater when he began receiving anonymous phone calls.
tated that although he could not prove who the

caller was he felt sure it’ was ROCKY PRANO, as he recognized

his voice. In these phone calls he was told they had
found out that he did not have a silent partner, and that
if he did not go out of business they would break both of
his legs with a baseball bat, and if he lived he would be
a cripple for life. One of these threatening calls was
received by his wife after which she became hysterical
and it was necassary for him to send her to Florida for
three or four weeks to recuperate.
