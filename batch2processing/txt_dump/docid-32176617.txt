TEAMSTERS official ineNew York Wity. Source described CONNO as
one of HOFFA's close assistants in the 1960s who may have
knowledge of HOFFA's activities prior to the assassination of= é
PRESIDENT KENNEDY. S -GRE i
Basedwlpon' source's relationships with past LCN bosses,
source commented that if RAGANO's claims about an LCN contract
against PRESIDENT KENNEDY: were true, RAGANO would have been
killed by the LCN years ago. Based on RAGANO's claims that HOFFA,
through RAGANO, requested TRAFFICANTE to arrange for the murder
of PRESIDENT KENNEDY, RAGANO should have been killed shortly
after PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S assassination. This would have been
done to prevent RAGANO from identifying either HOFFA or
TRAFFICANTE as orchestrating the "hit",

Thegfollowing information was telephonically provided
byxNy (856-0, *“o Special Agent WILLIAM M. MACKEY, Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), Washington Metropolitan Field office pfon
1/16-17/92:

Source learned Tampa, Florida, attorney FRANK RAGANO
(phonetic) would be appearing on the ABC News show "PRIME TIME
LIVE" on 1/16/92 claiming to have information that former
TEAMSTERS President JIMMY HOFFA instructed La Cosa Nostra (LCN)
bosses to kill President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963. Based upon
source's past relationship with both HOFFA and RAGANO, source
categorized RAGANO's claims as "lies". U

 

Source advised source's relationship with HOFFA began
in the ‘late 1950s while HOFFA was a Vice President of the
TEAMSTERS. Source's relationship with HOFFA lasted until HOFFA's
disappearance. Source described the relationship between source
and HOFFA as "close"{noting that source was one of HOFFA's few
associates who could meet with or call HOFFA at any time without
an appointment. Source stated HOFFA offered source a position as
one of HOFFA'S trusted assistants which source respectfully
declined

S

In regard to RAGANO, (Source recalled attending only
three or four meetings with HOFFA_gnd others in the early 1960s
which were also attended by RAGANGS)although source has not had
contact with RAGANO for many years, source recalled RAGANO (like
most people attempting to contact HOFFA) was required to make an
appointment to see HOFFA in the early 1960s. Source was n aware
if RAGANO'S status with HOFFA changed in later years.
