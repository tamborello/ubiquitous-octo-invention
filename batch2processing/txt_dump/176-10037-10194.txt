FOR AMBASSADOR FROM KOMER

Mrs. Kennedy had ortginally expected to put out news quietly
here that ehe had politely declined King's offer of house in Marrakech.

While still anxious that this be put on public record, she now
prefers that it be done from Moroccan end. Se hope you can suggest
it come froma Moroccans themselves. If this can't be arranged, we'd

appreciate it if you could background prose in low key yourself

. Mes, Kennedy aske that we exprees her apologies about putting you te

all this bether.
Theme of any release might be simply that Mro. Kennedy most

grateful for King's gitt. She hes written King personally expressing this

but regretfully declining for personal reasons, particularly that educating
and raising her childwen in US will leave her all too Httie time make

proper use of such a house in Marrakech,
