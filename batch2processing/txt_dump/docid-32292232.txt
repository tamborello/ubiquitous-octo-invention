We In view of the important position in the criminal
Ur" organization in Chicago held by LESLIE EARL KRUSE, Aka.-
LESTER KRUSE, CG file 92-1037, and considering his close
association with various Chicago hoodiums Chicago recently
instituted investigation of KRUSE under the Criminal
Intelligence Program.

Although it is true KRUSE meets other top hoodlums
frequently, as of this time it has not been determined that a
regular meeting place is used. KRUSE and others have been
observed in the basement restaurant of the Pittsfield Build-

location would not be considered feasible for the establish-

Inasmuch as Chicago investigation on KRUSE has just
been initiated, it is possible that his activities will
indicate a desirable location in which a highly confidential
source may be placed. i
