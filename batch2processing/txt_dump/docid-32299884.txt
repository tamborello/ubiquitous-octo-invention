On Thursday, 6/20/68, informant met. ALEX CAMARATA and PETE

MISURACA at the MISURACA residence in Richmond, California, at which
od time the discussion centered around depositions furnished by CAMARATA

and MISURACA earlier ‘that day. CAMARATA commented that there was
"nothing to it." He said he furnished. hs neme and address and took
the "Fifth" on all other questions. Informant said that it was
apparent from talking to PETE MISURACA that he did answer certain ~
questions, but MISURACA would not be specific a8 to what ones he
answered or what answers’ he might have given.

 

MISURACA said that during the taking of his deposition, .
an attorney showed him a cancelled check in the amount of $50,000.00
made out to PETE MAYO, allegédly issued by Harold's Club in Reno,
Nevada. ,The check reportedly was cashed by someone who endorsed it
as PETE MAYO. PETE said they would not tell him when or where the
check was cashed so he denied having any knowledge of it. PETE
commented that after completing his deposition, he and’ JOHN ,
ARDIZZONE had a brief discussion alone. He said ARDIZZONE said to
him, "Pete, you did a beautiful job." Upon hearing this, CAMARATA’
immediately threw up his hands as the, statement conveyed a special

i meaning that was caught by CAMARATA and the informant. Informant .

. explained that the word , "beautiful," has a different connotation '
when used in the Sicilian language. and that ARDIZZONE was actually ‘
telling PETE that he “fouled things.up." ALEX said to MISURACA,

"Pete, don't you understand that this means that you did not do a i
good job?" PETE then flew into a rage and began to castigate JOE
CERRITO. PETE said, "Someone is going to get stuck in this thing
and it's not going to be me. Joe has millions. Why should I pro- :
tect him? From now on, I'm going to look after myself. "PETE
, then referred to CERRITO as being "greedy" in that he had an: op-
portunity to withdraw the suit against "Life" after it had been
filed and in not taking this. opportunity, he made trouble for every-
one. ALEX CAMARATA then cut in and said, "Pete, you "re always ; ,
ready to blame someone when you don't know what you're talking ‘ i
about. Why do you think I was not at youw'wedding? I was on an ;
-errand." ; ; ;

 

Informant said this statement by CAMARATA recalled the
wedding of PETE's daughter in December, 1967, in Berkeley, California, =!
which was attended by LCN members, JOE CERRITO, MANNY FIGLIA and
SAL COSTANZA. He recalled PETE greeting JOE CERRITO and shaking
his hand and saying, "I see you're here, Mr. Joe, and some of the
other boys, but where is my nephew, Alex?" Before anyone could
reply, CERRITO cut in and in the Sicilian language said, "Never mind,
he's on an errand." Informant adyised that the subject concerning '
CAMARATA's -absence from the wedding was immediately dropped.

SF-2550-C-TE was contacted by SA RUDOLPH H. MANCINI on
6/14/68 and 6/17/68, and furnished the following information:

 

He came down with a virus infection on Tuesday, 6/11/68, ‘which
lasted throughout the week; therefore, he was unable to personally
contaet ALEX: CAMARATA or PETE MISURACA to instruct them to travel
to San Jose, California, for personal contact with MANNY FIGLIA.

On Thursday evening, 6/13/68, ALEX CAMARATA telephonically contacted
him at his home and expressed concern that the informant had been
out of touch. Informant explained his illness and suggested that ;
ALEX contact PETE and make arrangements for them to meet with MANNY
FIGLIA in San Jose as soon as possible. ALEX agreed to contact
MANNY in San Jose personally; however, he objected to going to San
Jose with PETE, stating he would not "go anywhere with Pete."

 

 

During the above conversation, ALEX also related that PETE
GIAMONA had been in contact with. him earlier that week at his home
and he expressed a desire to.meet with the informant. ALEX said he
telephonically contacted informant's residence but was unable to
reach anyone. Informant explained that at that particular time he \
and his wife were probably at the hospital visiting their sick nephew.
ALEX said that before PETE GIAMONA departed his residence, he said
he had to make a trip "back East" which would also inelude Florida.
ALEX did not relate to this further.

 

On Monday, 6/17/68, informant contacted ALEX at his home
in Martinez, California. ALEX related that he had contacted MANNY
FIGLIA at San Jose on Sunday, 6/16/68, and that he was very disturbed.
MANNY expressed concern because PETEws net with him and said he was i
very disappointed that he was having so much trouble. convincing ALEX
-and PETE MISURACA to follow instructions. ALEX said MANNY wanted
to know why he and PETE were disregarding direct orders from their
"capo" which is just in time. ALEX explained that they all have
a lot at stake here and that somebody might end ‘up in jail; there-
fore, they all must proceed cautiously. Informant stated.that this
points out the mistrust and resentment that is fermenting among the
members of. the San Jose family as a result of the JOE CERRITO- "Lifer
magazine suit. ALEX advised that MANNY. informed him that JOE CERRITO
has again changed his mind about what each must say during the
answering of questions when each furnishes a deposition... MANNY i
informed him that he and. PETE, like himself, are to "take the Fifth"
when questions are put to them. ALEX said MANNY also gave him the
impression that JOE CERRITO also will “take the Fifth" during his
deposition. - :

 SF-2550-C-TE was contacted by SA RUDOLPH H. MANCINI on
6/21/68 and furnished the following information: : oe

 

On ‘Tuesday, ‘ 6/18/68, he met MANNY FIGLIA at San Jose,
California, knowing he had furnished a deposition earlier that day
in the JOE CERRITO-"Life" Magazine matter. MANNY informed, with
the exception of his name and address, that he had taken the "Fifth"
in answer to all questions. He advised that he replied to all
questions, "I refuse to answer on grounds that it might tend to
incriminate me. MANNY said that the attorneys handling the ques-
tioning were not "local yokels" but ‘big-time attorneys from back
East. He said that he would not even admit that he knew his wife
or that they lived together. MANNY said they also asked him if he
knew of a party by the name of "AL COSTA".

MANNY explained that JOHN ARDIZZONE, JOE CERRITO's attorney,
was present during his deposition and ARDIZZONE later commented that
the questions "were not too bad" and perhaps they should have answered
them because there might be trouble later on. MANNY told informant
he should immediately contact PETE MISURACA and ALEX CAMARATA and
inform them of what he, MANNY, had-done. FIGLIA pointed out that
he was not telling them what to do, but he wanted them to know how
he had handled the matter and suggested that they do-the same.

 

Informant then questioned FIGLIA, stating this was in con-
trast to his previous contacts where FIGLIA stated these were
CERRITO's orders. MANNY then replied, "Well, they know what they're
supposed to do. I just want them to know how I handle it." MANNY
said he was particularly worried about PETE MISURACA as to what he
_Might say during questioning. ; j

On Tuesday night, 6/18/68, he met ALEX CAMARATA and PETE .
MISURACA at MISURACA's home in Richmond, California. He informed :
them of his personal contact with FIGLIA and that FIGLIA had "taken
the Fifth" during his deposition earlier that day. MISURACA informed
that he might not show up to honor the subpoena _.on..6/20/68 as he
did not sign it. ALEX and the informant finally convinced MISURACA
that he had to honor the subpoena or it would be trouble for every-
body. MISURACA then produced an issue of the "Life" Magazine, the ;
one which contained an article that made reference to him. PETE ; :
said, "I'm going to make them pay for this stuff. I'm going to sue . ;
'Life’ Magazine for twenty million dollars. I'm going to give each
of you guys one million dollars." | :
