Reorganization of the Internal Security Branch of
DID occurred in 1964, to afford improved supervision of the
increased volume of information received and to chart new avenues
of approach te effectively discharge our responsibilities in the
potentially explosive racial field. In July, 1964, supervisory
responsibility for investigation, of racial matters, racial
informants, Ku Klux Klan and related groups together with the
development of informants concerning these matters were transferred
from the General Investigative Division (GID) to DID. Five
Special Agents and approximately 1,350 eases were involved in
this transfer. Three Agents formed the Racial Intelligence Unit
in the Subversive Control Section and two Agents formed the
Racial Informant Unit in the Internal Security Section. In 1965,
there were 37,818 active subversive investigative matters and
10,557 active racial investigative matters throughout the United
States.

Ta 1963 and 1964, a number of significant and fast-

moving events occurred which directly or Indirectly influenced

 

the reorganization of the Internal Gecurity Branch in 1964. A

Ceneral of the United States. It was anticipated that, if the
CPUSA and its members refused to register, a heavy burden
relating to prosecution of the organization and its members
would be placed on the Bureau and, consequently, on the
Internal Security Section.

It was concluded, therefore, that by dividing the
Internal Security Section into two sections, each headed by a
Section Chief, tighter controls over the supervision of the
various classifications could be maintained and the vast amount
of work moze effectively handled. Based on this analysis, the
Internal Security Section of DID was divided into two sections
during August, 1955. They were identified as the Internal
Security Section and Subversive Control Section. The new
Internal Security Section was made responsible for all sub-
stantive violations of Federal statutes involving the internal
security and the Security Informant Program. The Subversive
Control Section was assigned the supervision and maintenance
of the Security Index, the Emergency Detention Program and

maintenance of the Attorney General's portfolio.

Special /zent Supervisors, a Section Chief, and Number One Man. j
The Subversive Control Section was assigned a total of 73
employees including 31 Special Agent Supervisors, a Section
Chief, and Number One Man.

Subsequently, the finding by the Subversive Activities
Control Board that the CPUSA was a communist-action organization,
and, therefore, required to register with the Attorney General,
was upheld by the U. S. Supreme Court in June, 1961, As
anticipated at the time of the reorganization of the Internal
Security Section, the CPUSA and its officers and members refused
to register. Failure to register was subject to criminal
sanctions and prosecutions of the Party and its members were
instituted.

The Intelligence Division (ID) was known as the

 

Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) in January, 1955, and was
composed of four sections: internal Security, Espionage,
Liaison, and Central Research. Principal cases supervised in
the DID in January, 1955, were Espionage, Internal Security and
Nationalistic Tendency matters.

In August, 1955, the Internal Security Section was the
volume section in the DID. It. supervised investigations
conducted under legislation, such as the Internal Security Act
of 1950, Communist Control Act of 1954 and the Smith Act of 1940.
It also handled investigations of communist front organizations
and of subjects involved in possible violations of the
Neutrality Act, and Sedition, Treason and the Federal Train
Wreck. statutes and the Labor Management Relations Act. In

; : addition, the Internal Security Section was responsible for the
handling of violations of Federal injunctions, security informants,
' Alien Enemy Control and related matters, and the Security Index.
The Smith Act cases alone demanded considerable time because of
the aspect of. prosecution involving subjects of these cases.
The Internal Security Section was confronted also with the
prospect that the Supreme Court might uphold the Subversive
Activities Control Board order requiring registration by the
Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), and its members with the Attorney
