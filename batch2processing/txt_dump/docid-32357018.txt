“s.Let me say first that I know it must have been difficult for you”:
“to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter. I believe [: .
-can appreciate. your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic ;

death a few years ago and the.current poor state of your wife's health.

In your ‘situation, I can well imagine how the attentions you - .
described in your.letter affect both you and your wife. However, my |”

‘activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years. The
- flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren

_may have becone “newsworthy” again in view of the renewed interest ©°.
in the Kennedy assassination and, thus, may, be-attracting the atten- ~

tion of people in the media.

Thank you for your good wishes on my new job. As you can imagine,
I'm finding it interesting and challenging. — ae

5. Mr, Helms' 3 dune 1964 memorandum for the Warren Commission on —
the de Mohrénschiidts is attached at C. it describes the Agency's
interest in obtaining reports ‘from Mr. dé Mohrenschildt in 1957 as a
result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year. Contact Division (now
Domestic Coliection Division - DCD) had its resident agent. in Dallas, ue eee ae
Mr. J. Walton Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschiidt at that time. The en ae
history of Mr.-Moore's relationship with Mr. de HMohrenschildt from 1957 -
- to 1961 is also attached at C. As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested _
traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt. : The trace results (attached at D) con-
tained sufficient derogatory information . to preclude further’ extensive
contact with the de Mohrenschildts. (An 0S summary on Mir. de Mohrenschiidt LES

to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy ‘in Haiti from about 1964 to
1966. - (This was probably not uncovered at. the time of the external in-_.

“Conclusions:

colorful life as a petroleum engineer and businessman... He ‘is both well

 

 

   
   

and poorly connected, and some of his associations in the past have
raised serious questions. Certainly his relationship with the
Oswalds has’ caused him considerable trouble and may have caused this

' than was necessary. ne to ca pe

10. Both the FBI and this Agency, however, had dropped their
interests in Mr. de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late -"
1960's. We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could’
either be from local authorities in Dallas or from media representa-
tives on the trail of a warmed over story concerning the assassination
of President Kennedy. We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond .

Mr. Moore's reports attached at F. What we can say is that we have © 7
found no indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active os,
interest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent years. ©. ee PEED
