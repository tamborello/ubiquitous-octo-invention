Review Board

Dear David:

This is in response to your letter of November 8, 1995_
in which you conveyed the request of the Assassination
Records Review Board to be provided access to “any and all
internal CIA histories or retrospective studies or reports”
on several topics.

We have begun to identify histories and other items
that would meet the Board's request. The CIA Historian is
‘assisting in this effort.

I suggest that we discuss with you or your staff. the
possibility of modifying the requést somewhat. Several of
the items mentioned in your letter cover a broad range of
topics. It would be helpful, for example, if the pertinent
historical time period for each item were specified, as well
as what topics in the requested items would be of interest
to the Board. This would assist us in excluding sensitive
information that the Board would regard as non-relevant to
the assassination or to the scope of the investigation.

.Given the sensitivity of some of the materials
requested, we would prefer that you designate one or two
people to review the histories and other items in our
offices.

Please let me know your views on the above suggestions.
We appreciate the constructive efforts that you and your
colleagues have made over the past year to work out reasonable,
secure ways of handling documents. For our part, we are
committed to being as responsive as possible to the Board's
interests. :

Sincerely,
9

DO Focal Point for JFK Board

FROM: J. Barry Harrelson
DCI/CSI/HRG-Senior Review Officer

SUBJECT: UJMWAVE History -
ARRB Request CIA #7

1. We are now at a crossroads on a number of issues,
including ARRB staff requests to review Agency files and
other materials which were not within the JFK assassination
collection. A number of these issues have been pending for
over a year.

2. One such request deals with access to review a
number of CIA histories which might provide further insight
into the assassination or provide leads to information which
would do the same. A specific history which has been
identified as a priority is the JMWAVE history. It is our
understanding that the JMWAVE history consists of 32
chapters and that they may not be all together in one volume
(see attached). In terms of timing, we need to move quickly
on this to find this history and review it.

3. Thank you for your assistance on this. If you have
any questions, please call me (613-1825) 31825) or Gary
Breneman (613-1839/; (31839). reeset re

have anticipated, please advise us so that we can work with you to modify or amend
the requests accordingly. .

In requesting access to these materials, we are not designating them “assassination

Central Intelligence Agency provide access to any and all internal CIA histories or
retrospective studies or reports on the following topics:

1. The JMWAVE Station;

2. The Mexico City Station;

3. CIA activities with respect to Cuba covering the period October 1, 1962 to
January 1,1964;

5. John McCone as Director of Central Intelligence.
In addition, we would like to request:

6. All indices to CIA histories held by the history staff of the Center for the Study

This request should be interpreted in its broadest reasonable sense. To the extent that
you question whether a particular type of study or report is encompassed by our
request, please let us know and we can advise you whether we seek to include it.
