PAGE 2 RUEPIA 31X CONFIDENTIAL
SOURCE: CUBAN NATIONAL, PRESENTLY LIVING IN THE U.S.
SOURCE HAS BEEN AN AGRICULTURAN ENGINEER FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND
aS EMPLOYED BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
FOR OVER 15 YEARS. DURING THE BATISTA REGIME, AS WELL AS TWO
YEARS UNDER THE CASTRO REGIME, HE WAS DEPUTY CHIEF OF PLANS AND
PROGRAMS IN THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE. HE IS VERY FAMILIAR
WITH THE AGRICULTURAL AREA IN ORIENTE, AND HAS PROVIDED EXCELLENT
INFORMATION ONCUBAN AGRICULTURE NUMEROUS TIMES IN THE PAST. HE
IS CONSIDERED AN AUTHORITY IN THIS FIELD.
(THIS REPORT WAS DEVELOPED BY AN AFNIN AIR FORCE REPRESENTATIVE
ASSIGNED TO THE OFFICE OF PREPARATION.)

1. BASED ON MY EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE CUBAN AGRICULTURAL

FIELD, AND HAVING WITNESSED DAMAGE TO CUBAN AGRICULTURE BY PAST

HURRICANES, I ESTIMATE THAT THE HURRICANE FLORA, PROBABLY
DESTROYED CLOSE TO 58 PER CENT OF CUBA’S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
FOR THIS YEAR, AND WILL HAVE A SERIOUS EFFECT ON NEXT YEARS*S
PRODUCTION. THE AREA WHERE THE HURRICANE WAS STATIONARY FOR
SEVERAL DAYS, IS THE PRINCIPAL GRAIN BELT IN CUBA.

2. ABOUT 5g TO 6@ PER CENT OF CUBA*S RICE IS GROWN IN
ORIENTE, IN THE AREA OF MANZANILLO. A CUBAN VARIETY OF RICE, KNOWN
PAGE 3 RUEPIA 31X CONFIDENTIAL

AS ZAYAS BAZAN (OR HONDURAS) IS PLANTED IN THIS AREA AND HAS A
PECULIAR CHARACTERISTIC. THE STEM OF THIS RICE IS VERY WEAK,
AND ALWAYS BENDS WHEN THE FULL HEAD IS FORMED, ABOUT A MONTH
BEFORE HARVEST. THIS VARIETY OF RICE IS HARVESTED, STARTING
ABOUT 15 NOVEMBER, SO I ASSUME THAT MOST OF IT IS Now DOWN.
BECAUSE OF THIS CHARACTERISTIC THE RICE HAD TO BE HARVESTED BY
HAND, OR UeS. MACHINERY MODIFIED, SINCE THE RICE HEADS HAD TO
BE PICKED. FROM THE GROUND. IT WAS ALSONECESSARY TO DRAIN THE
WATER OFF THE RICE A MONTH TO SIX WEEKS BEFORE HARVEST, SO THAT
THE HEADS WOULD NOT GERMINATE AND ROT IN THE WATER. DUE TO THE-
EXTREME FLOODING DURING THE RECENT HURRICANE AND THE FACT THAT
THE RICE WAS ALMOST READY FOR HARVEST, I ESTIMATE THAT THE ENTIRE
CROP WILL BE LOST.

3. MOST OF THE BEANS CONSUMED IN CUBA ARE GROWN IN THE
HOLGUIN AREA. BEAN PLANTS CAN NOT STAND TOO MUCH FLOODING, OR
EXCESSIVE WINDS. I AM REASONABLY SURE THAT NOST OF THE BEAN CROP
WILL BE LOST.

4s KOLGUIN WAS ALSOTHE CENTER FOR CORN EXPERIMENTATION.
THE CORNDLLI SEED COMPANY ESTABLISHED A LARGE EXPERIMENTAL FARM
NEAR HOLGUIN, PRIOR TO THE CASTRO REGIME, WHICH WAS TAKEN OVER
