FOREIGN POLITICAL MATTERS ~ CUBA

- In connection with the meeting mentioned above at which leaders
of the Orthodox Party and Sanchez Arango were allegedly present, it is
interesting to note that according to information received from local
American Legion contacts, Jose Antoniehuarte opesa, young Cuban
recently arrested in New York in connection with the discovery of a storage
of arms, is a member oF the Orthodox Party and according to sources, was 3
very outspoken advocate of violent action prior to his leaving Cuba. The
Orthodox Party publicly follows a line of more or less complete isolation
from other political parties; but it would appear that within the party,
there are elements which desire direct action and who are not hesitating
to deal with representatives of other parties such as the Autentico Party
of Prio and Sanchez Arango .fgB\(U

The above is for the Bureau's information. iWo distribution has
been made of the above informatjon sinc e Bureau instructed that none
of the information furnished by(Source Sfnoua be referred to directly ors_)
indirectly to anyone outside this office. ~
