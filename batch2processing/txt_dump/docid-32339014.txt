_ Dear Gertrude:

  
 

' JOHN HOWARD LAWSON :
S48 ELYRIADRIVE
LOS ANGELES, CALIF. 90065°

March 12, 1967)

~~" “ft seems tha ‘ we “Allow ‘much, too much
time’ to pass between letters. By the time I get around
to writing you and Stefan, & find I have forgotten
many of the things I wanted to say, and regret that I
have not made notes of them from one moment to another.

We spent a day ‘down at’ laguna Hills with

Herb and Ann Morais, » and of course we talked | of you, and,
they sent their cordial greetings.

“I want especially to. ‘mention a book
about-mhich you have had. some_ correspondence. with the ..

 

 

‘. were related to this experience, but, in general people 2
who do not take much interest. in. "Literature" have found; ~:~

\,face the Bocial-political issues, hecause the account of
a

author, Ethel Bertolini *). She’ is. séiding you a copy,
and trust “you will give it (as = am sure you will)
your generous attention, The book, AND MY HEART WAS
AT ROME, a fictionialized, semi- documentary account of
the. lifes of people who faced: the bitter struggle
against deportation. These stories of the foreign-born,
and of the. remarkable work of the Committee for their
defense ,have a warmth and honesty which stems from

the feeling which went into the book.

: “The book has received a remarkable
response from working people-- not only those who

something that touches and moves them-- and I imagine
this would be true of this sort of people in other

countries. She has some remarkable letters of the sort) | -

Sue and I are well, and both of us are

--working hard, .I received an “invitation from the film gz:
association m in Moscow to come to the cinema celebra-

tion of the f£iftzeth. anniversary ,. but it is not at all ~
possible for us. to cx) abroad fnow or. in the foreseeable
future, : 7” vr
As I have noted in previous letters,

I am concentrating (along with many incidental and time-
consuming ¥asks) on my autobiography. I finished one
‘volume running only through the twenties, and received:
some flattering comments, but I, decided that the first.
volume had to go through the thirties in order to
the cultural meaning of what is cailed. "Commitment" and
how it affects the arts is the core of the book . .
matters, in.my opinion, on which there is wondertul
confusion. ,

I wish only that we could sit down with you
and Stefan and really talk about these things. It is
nice to imagine, and sad that it cannot be realized,

Sue joins in love to you both,  Ogeel |
