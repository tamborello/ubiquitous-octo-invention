WASHINGTON

27 September 1962
MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
The Special Group (Augmented) and the Special Group (5412) took

the following actions at their meetings today:

1. MONGOOSE

 

In accordance with an earlier request by the Group, a proposal
for the use of balloons to drop propaganda leaflets, and possibly
other small objects of propaganda value, over Cuba was discussed.
The Group approved the concept, subject to presentation of a more
detailed operational plan.

In brief this operation would involve the release from a small
boat, on a periodic basis, of small balloons which would overfly Cuba
at night and would drop propaganda materials through the means of a
timing device. The Group felt that such an operation should be con-
ducted ostensibly by Cuban exiles, with close policy control behind
the scenes. The latter woujd include approval of the content of the
propaganda through secure “contact witht the Cubans involved. Reliable
weather and other technical information would be provided.

CIA has built up a considerable body of technical know-how on
operations of the type, from previous activities of a similar nature
in Europe.

2. Program Against Vietnam

The Group considered a proposal by CIA for covert activities
designed to harass the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This had been
prepared in response to a request by the Secretaries of State and
Defense.

The Special Group asked that a more detailed operational plan be |
prepared. In the meantime it was agreed that Defense will make certain
equipment and personnel available to CIA in support of this program.

An Elint flight designed to identify the North Vietnamese radar order

of battle, so as to permit planning of overflight routes, was authorized.
This will be flown out of Saigon, using the specially-equipped aircraft
available on Taiwan, but with the Chinese Air Force markings removed,
and employing Chinese Nationalist pilots documented as South Vietnamese
citizens.

3. Stay-Behind Planning, Laos

 

The Group approved a CIA proposal for stay-behind activities in
laos, involving Meo and Kha tribesmen. The mission of these individuals,
who have already been trained and equipped, will be basically restricted
to the collection of intelligence and the securing of safe areas.
