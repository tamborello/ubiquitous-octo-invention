one being mailed from New York City. In TROUSKY circles it was
considered that KLEMENT had been kidnapped by the G.P.U. (Soviet
Intelligence) and forced to write the letters. VAN HEIJENOORT
continued that in about September, 1938, the body of KLEMENT was :
; ~recovered from the Seine River in Paris. Inquiry by the French :
: police never solved the disappearance and death of KLEMENT,

 

. VAN HEIJENOORT pointed out that in light of the present
knowledge that ETIEHNE (MARK ZBOROWSKI), ROMAN WELL (ROBERT SOBLE)
and SENIN (JACK SOBLE) were then agents of the G.P.U., the
following items in the Archives folder relating to RUDOLF KLEMENT
appear to be significant. ;
