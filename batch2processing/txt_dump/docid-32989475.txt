The 8th World Convention Against Atomic

and Hydrogen Bombs ended late in the.
evening of August 6, 1962. Due to the
confusion caused by political parties
attempting to utilize this convention,

and a head-on clash between the Japan
Socialist Party (JSP) and the Japanese
Communist Party (JCP), no unified resa-
lution or declaration was adopted. The

JSP presented a last minute motion calling
for a protest against Soviet nuclear
testing in the name of the Gensuikyo Conven-
tion. The JCP, supported by the Chinese
Communist delegation, rejected with force
the socialist proposal. This led to a walk-
out by the socialists, and the convention
was adjourned in a near riot atmosphere. (C)

A meeting of the NG was held on October 3, 1963,
at the American Russian Institute (ARI), 90 Mc Allister
Street, San Francisco, to plan for a coming talk by KAORU
YASUI. While discussing a chairman for the coming event,
the individuals present at the meeting agreed that, if
possible, the chairman should be someone not too far to
the left so that outsiders would be encouraged to.come.
MARGARET DRIGGS phoned various individuals and invited them
to attend this meeting. Approximately thirteen people

attended. a \ [st To6 - 10/4/63 | gf

The ARI of San Francisco has been designated
by the Attorney General of the United States
pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

On November 17, 1963, the NG sponsored a public
meeting at the Scottish Rite Auditorium, Van Ness Avenue
and Sutter Street, San Francisco, California, attended by
approximately three hundred individuals. JOSEPH P. MORRAY,
chairman of the meeting, introduced Professor KAORU YASUI.
YASUI stated that he was making a ten-day tour of the
United States. He said he had a lot of trouble in obtaining
a visa in coming to the United States and did not know
whether he could come again.

YASUI talked about Nagasaki and Hiroshima and said
he wanted to obtain 35,000,000 signatures to ban all nuclear
weapons. He said Okinawa was heavily armed with United
States nuclear weapons and that this put Japan in great
danger. He said that in the next year there would be a world
peace conference in Japan and he asked that as many
delegates as possible attend from the United States.

YASUI praised some of the women present in the audience
who had recently attended a peace march in Japan.

YASUL also read a poem which expressed grief at
losing so many lives during the Nagasaki and Hiroshima
tragedies. He discussed the after affects of radiation and
the deformities of his people. YASUI said that he had
talked to Premiere KHRUSHCHEV and MAO Tse-tung concerning
the banning of nuclear weapons. He also talked to these two
men on the Soviet - China dispute, which he described as
being very bad, but which would eventually be ironed out.
YASUI said he sent letters to KHRUSHCHEV, MAO and President
KENNEDY concerning the banning of nuclear arms, but that the
United States Ambassador rejected his letter and it never
reached President KENNEDY.

At this point, JOSEPH P. MORRAY pointed out that
this showed the United States was not interested in going
along with other countries. YASUI went on to say that the
political climate was changing and that he believed
socialist countries would be able to come to some understanding.
Following YASUI, MARGARET DRIGGS made a collection speech,
and BARBARA DANE from Vancouver, B.C. sang a number of folk
Songs 5 mainly pertaining to the bad housing and economic
conditions of the Bay Area. A question and answer period
followed.

On November 17, 1963, the NG sponsored a public
meeting at the Scottish Rite Auditorium, Van Ness Avenue
and Sutter Street, San Francisco. Approximately 275 - 300
people attended. The guest speaker, KAORU YASUI, was
introduced by JOSEPH P. MORRAY. YASUI opened his talk by
praising the NG. He said that all tests and bombs must
be banned along with complete disarmement. He played up
the dropping of bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and added
that he did not defend the bombing of Pearl Harbor which
was not the people's choice. He said the rift between
Russia and China has hurt the peace movement in Japan,

"In protest at the Bikini death and poisoning of Japanese

"At the 1962 Hiroshima Conference serious divisions developed
because the conference failed to condemn Soviet as well as
U.S. nuclear tests. Further divisions within Gensuikyo caused
Professor Yasui to resign temporarily with the statement that
in Japan , the only country which had actually experienced
atomic bombings, there is a 'strong determination there shall
never again be A and H bombs. This natural sentiment must

be respected. It is impossible to oppose nuclear tests by
one particular country and support nuclear tests by another
particular country.'

"As the 1963 anniversary of Hiroshima approached, pressure
mounted for the recall of Professor Yasui to reunite
Gensuikyo.
the conference held in Hiroshima this past August and steered
it through stormy sessions which restated the overwhelming
Japanese opposition to all nuclear arms in Japan and through-
out the world.

The Department of the Navy in its analysis
of JOSEPH PARKER MORRAY's book, “Pride of
State, published in 1959, says that in his
general attitude toward American foreign
policy and his view of communist activity,
MORRAY echoes the CP line at every point.
To him, the communists are authentic
nationalists and the Korean War was a
“domestic dispute.” He, in effect, labels
all American efforts to resist communist
expansion as capitalist imperialism.

ANG leaflet has been furnished showing the following
information:

"KAORU YASUI

"Kaoru Yasui, member of the Board of Governors and Dean of the
Law Faculty at Tokyo's Hosei University (30,000 students), is
a world-renowned authority in international law. As founder
and chairman of Gensuikyo - the Japan Council Against Atomic
and Hydrogen Bembs - Professor Yasui is known as ‘father of
the nuclear disarmament movement in Japan.'

A characterization of the NG is contained
in the appendix.

MARGARET DRIGCGS was interviewed by Special
Agents of the FBI on January 25, 1955, at
which time she advised that her activity

in the CP as well as that of her husband,
HAROLD DRIGGS, began in the middle 1930s
during the depression in Tacoma, Washington.
She said that when she and her husband
moved to Seattle, Washington, they continued
their membership and activity in the CP

and in the Communist Political Association
(CPA). She said that as.a result of open
eriticism of CP functionaries on her part
and on the part of her husband, she and her
husband were expelled from the CP in 1946,
with the proviso that after six months they
would reinstate. She said, however, that
she and her husband moved and that they did
not reinstate.

The CPA has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

LEE COE was one of the leaders of a
factional group of the CP who were meeting
with the District Board of the CP to iron
out the factional difficulties.
