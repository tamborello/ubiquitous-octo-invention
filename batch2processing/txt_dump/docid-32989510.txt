supjecT:SENSTUDY 75
(BUREAU FILE 62-116395)

Re Bureau nitel to all SACs dated 5/2/75.

The captioned matter pertains to the Bureau's.
handling of requests from the Senate and the House Select
Committee to study governmental operations with respect
to intelligence activities. In connection with the work
of these committees, staff members may seek to interview
current and former FBI employeés.

The Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff recently
interviewed several former employees. It is anticipated
that many more such personnel will be contacted.

: The Bureau has pledged full cooperation with the
committee and desires to assist and facilitate any
investigations undertaken by the committee with respect
to the FBI. However, the Bureau has an obligation to
insure that sensitive sources and methods and ongoing
sensitive investigations are fWlly protected. Should any
former employee contact the Chicago Office and have any
question regarding his obligation not to divulge information
obtained by virtue of his past FBI employment, he should
be instructed to contact Legal Counsel, FBIHQ, by collect
call. Conversations with former FBI employees must be
in keeping with the Bureau's pledge, It is believed that
such a procedure would insure proper protection and also
facilitate the work of the SSC.

The above procedure also applies to current employees
of the Chicago Office. However, contact with the Legal
Counsel should be handled through the SAC.
