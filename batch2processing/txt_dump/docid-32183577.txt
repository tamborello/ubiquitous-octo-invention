ance calls he began receiving about 9/19/66. . The calls would
come about 3:00 or 4:00 o'clock every morning for about two weeks,
then stopped, but started again about the middle of October

1966. When he had been in the rental office of his apartment
building on Saturday, 12/3/66, Mrs. SNYDER and the building
superintendent each told him of having received calls from a
woman who insisted that they tell her who Mr. PEACOCK was

living with. He had considered it very amusing because he

had never been married and did not know anyone who could be
‘aceusing him of living with a woman at 611 Park Avenue.

When Mr. PEACOCK had returned hom on Monday night, 12/5/66,

he found. under his door a telegram. He had not recognized any

of the names mentioned in the telegram or the name CHARLOTTE,
which was signed to the telegram, so had called Western Union

to find out who had sent the telegram to him. They had furnished
the name and telephone number of the sender and he had dialed
this number. A man had answered the phone and turned him over to
a woman, who said she was CHARLOTTE's mother. She asked whether
he was a Senator and how many telegrams he had received from
CHARLOTTE, She had indicated that CHARLOTTE was in the habit

of sending telegrams and telephoning prominent people with no
provocation.

On 12/16/66, Mr. PEACOCK made available the text of the tele-
gram he had received and the names he had received from Western
Union. The text was: "CYNTHIA TILTON was other person at

Texas November 22, 1963. Could you possibly stay with ALEXANDER
MAC INTYRE. Call me if you can. CHARLOTTE."

The telegram was sent 8 CHARLOTTE STAUBS, 1018 South Clinton
Street, telephone 675-4893, which is subscribed to by JOHN
PATRICK REGAN. .

A check of information previously received by the Baltimore
Division reflects that CHARLOTTE STAUBS has telephoned the
Baltimore Office innumerable times since 1952. has admitted
being confined to Springfield State Mental Hospital, and

as furnished nothing but incoherent and unreal information.
