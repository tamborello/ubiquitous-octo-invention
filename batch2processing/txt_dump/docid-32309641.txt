MM T-5 said NIEVES. is completely discredited in-the Cuba
“exile community ‘and he knows of no members of the. Spanish
speaking’ press in Miami’ who plan to attend the. proposed
congress. .

ele, "The Miami’ News", a ‘daily newspaper published in
Miami, Florida, on January 10, 1973, contained an artical
stating: that a Miami group of Cuban exiles. planned to hold.
a revolutionary congress in Jamaica to discuss a peaceful

- political’ ‘settlement with the Prime Minister of Cuba instead
of his: violent downfall. Congress ° was scheduled to be held
from January: 25. through 29, 1973 at Montego Bay, Jamaica,

‘The artical continued that the congress coordinator,
LUCIANO NIEVES, said-that:a delegation from Cuba would =
participate and © has - ‘been authorized: to: attend.

NIEVES. said Cuban. exiles must use a different
tactic. ‘with CASTRO and start from thé basis that the exiles
have lost. the military war. NIEVES' group called themselves .
the "Group of the Political Opening Thesis" and delegates
were expected to represent groups in. Puerto Rico, New York,

Chicago, California, Atlanta, Venezuela,. Dominican Republic,
and Colombia. The Miami coordinator was listed as IVAN
GARCIA,

NIEVES said there were “50 or 60 active members
in his political opening group and that they had been
‘quietly obtaining support among the other Cuban exilés
for the past four years.
