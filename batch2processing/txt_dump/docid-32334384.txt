ently. He said he had written a story about the whole Bogalusa
situation which exposed the racial demonstrations in Bogalusa as
part of the communist conspiracy. COTTON stated that all racial

stated that the Federal Government was behind many of the racial
demonstrations in this country and that these disturbances had
been planned by the Federal Government. He complained of being
harassed by the FBI and claimed that the racial disturbances,
which were occurring at the present time were planned months ago.
He also spoke on the Selma to Montgomery march by Negores and claimed
that this march was nothing but a sex orgy for three days.

Government, but urged those in attendance to give their vholehearted

support to law enforcement officials.

On the morning of September 6, 1965, SAXON FARMER was
overheard to remark that ROBBRY DEPUGH, the National Commander of
the "Minutemen" would not be coning to Bogalusa, Louisiana to speak
at the Klan rally to be held on September 6, 1965. FARMER aclaimed
that when the Federal Government found out that DEPUGH was supposed
to come to Bogalusa to speak , they had given DEPUGH some kind of
court order to appear in court.

FARMER remarked that Reverend FARRELL GRISWALD from
Montgomery, Alabama would be coming to Bogalusa to speak in place of
DEPUGH. FARMER stated that the Klan would pay all travel expenses
for the main speakers at this rally, who would be Judge JOHN RARRICK,
RICHARD COTTON and FARRELL GRISWALD.

There were observed in SAX FARMER's place of business a
Klan leaflet entitled "Fifty Reasons Why You Should Be a Member Of
The Ku Klux Klan."

At approximately 1:30 p.m. a motor parade of white indi-
viduals left the downtown area of Bogalusa and proceeded to the

Bogalusa Municipal Airport.
