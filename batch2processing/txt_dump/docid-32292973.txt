Delay in report is noted, however, this case
was. investigated on a continuing basis and maintained
n ajcurrent status.

 

On October 16, last contact made with CG 7016 CTE
whose identity as upper echelon leader of organized crime
: . in Chicago known to Bureau. CTE advised that he attended
i ; a top leadership meeting shortly after death of RICCA in
which current situation was subject. Present at meeting \\)
were ANTHONY J. .ACCARDO with whom CCA has shared the SY
top leadership in recent past, cts Wes, RALPERRLERCE,
RUSE, ‘all upper echelon ‘leaders of oBgani zed
sponsibility for affairs of organized crime
in Loop, Souty side, and Lake County, Illinois, respectively. |

 
 
   
 

At meeting ACCARDO announced he will remain
top leader of organized crime, and RICCA will not be replaced.
However, ACCARDO informed ALEX he will rely more and more on Looks
ALEX's advice on policy matters. CTE advised that “ALEX, :
probably thermost intelligent and personable hoodlum
leader now available has during past several years since
death of MURRAY L. HUMPHREYS, assumed more and more
responsibilities due to respect which he commands from |
all leaders and members and from contacts outside
organization in politics, labor, and légitimate business. i
CTE advised that close relationship which has existed
‘for decades between ALEX and hoodlum. Attorney SIDNEY R.
: 4 probably the best contact organized crime has in
fountry, stands ALEX in good stead since he is able to -\%°
move himself and other organized crime figures into ‘
favorable situations through KORSHAK throughout the
country.

 

 

 

   

 

 

t . CTE also advised that JOSEPH AIUPPA, upper

\ echelon leader of organized crime with responsibility

: : for Cicero, illinois, will also be relied on more heavily in vr
i future by ACCARDO, CTE advised ATUPPA is not particularly
intelligent or capable hoodlum but has brought money

into organization for decades and has never "stumbled"

by bringing any particuhar heat to organization, other

than that which normally accrues to top leaders.
