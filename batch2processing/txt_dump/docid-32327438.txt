SEALANS Je JONES.

. Assistant United States Attorney JMBS E.. HATING, before know-
ing that > ‘DALE and PEARSON were in custody at the time of this violation,
stated that he felt that all three should be indicted so that there would.

‘be no fear of the subjects fighting removal, as they would probably do,

if arrested on the basis of a Commissioner's Warrant, At the time of the
indictment, there was a reasonable doubt existent concerning the identity —
of JOHN A, PEARSON as a subject, but in view of the above, KEATING decided
that he should be indicted along with DALE and LONDOS. He said, however,
that in spite of the indictments, the Bureau should continue thab phase

of their investigation to identify GRANT -and PEARSON, the two "steerers!'.

He cited also that there was need of additional evidence to convict LONDOS ;

and for that reason, extreme care should be taken to arrest LONDOS in his

_residence for the purpose of securing items of evidence such as type-

writers, » penss pencils, credentials, Clothing, address books, etc.

After the issuance of warrants based on the above mentioned
indictments, KEATING advised that. he did not consider the dismissal of
said indictments prudent since upon the eventual identification and
apprehension of GRANT and PEARSON, the'steerers!', the indictments could
then be changéd, He stated that if ‘the indictment s were dismissed now,
that against LONDOS would automatically be dropped also since he is
mentioned in both countss He advised that the Bureau or the Department
would not be liable to legal damages from DALE or PEARSON as long as the
Bureau did not cause the arrest of either DALE or PEARSON ‘who are now, in
custody. .. . a \
