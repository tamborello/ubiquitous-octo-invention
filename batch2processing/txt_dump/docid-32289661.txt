Please refer to your 13764 dated 7th March, 1962, in which
mention was made of CHAVEZ' connection with the Teamsters Union
in Puerto Rico and of his visit to the Bahamas with his wife.

Enquiries have disclosed that Frank CHAVEZ booked in at
the Nassau feach Hotel on 21st October, 1961, in company with two
‘men, JaimexAMADOR of $00 Figueroa, Santurce, Puerto Rico, with whom
he shared a suite until they 1e?t on 24th October. On leaving CHAVEZ
paid the bill with a Teamsters Union cheque on the Banco de Puerto
Rico ~ Step 17 Branch - Santurce - Puerto Rico. Apart from the hotel
bill he «cashed two cheques for himself but these have since been
returned by the Puerto Rico bank endorsed ‘Insufficient Funds’.
The hotel manager has written to him at the address given, which was
30 Galle Doncella, Santurce, Fuerto Rico, but has received no reply.

 

“According to your source, when the Bahamas authorities ‘learned
of the-arrivel of "powerful Trujillistas" in Nassau, they requested
CHAVEZ and ‘His: wife to leave the island. We understand that this
was not the,cases So far as is known CHAVEZ left on 24th October
and, again so-fAr as is known, he was not in the Bahamas at the time

 

 

that Ard snend: ‘RUJILLO arrived on 1st Noverbers a ; ng |
‘PHere vis'a report that on 22nd Octobe ESPAILLAT spent the afterP Ne |

noon adfanking with some "foreigners" in a room at the Nassau Beach oy,

Hotel, “Which might have referred to CHAVEZ and his companions, but «

this is certainly not firm. ,
