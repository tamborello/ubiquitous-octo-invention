cluded that this letter had been accidently removed by the cutting

.process applied to page 152 and that its removal resulted from the .

application of excessive pregsura on the cutting tool: when the letter:
on page 152 waa taken out. ;

The sample is ‘considered too gmall for any valid conclusions to
be reached as to the purposes for which the above noted letters were
removed. It is considered most unlikely that this process of letter
removal has any cryptographic implication. .
