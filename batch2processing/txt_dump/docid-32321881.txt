Collection Act of 1992 (JFKRCA) any materials considered
assassination records must be made available to the National

information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be
maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in
full.Therefore, the files will not be returned to your field
office. Since the originals will be sent to NARA, copies of these
files should be made for record purposes prior to their shipment
