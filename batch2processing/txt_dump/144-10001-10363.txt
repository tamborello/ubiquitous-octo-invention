The following statement of Zanzibar coup d"gtat has just
been issued by the Uganda Minister of Tatormatlon, Bronte isting
and Tapetems ‘

"Who deposed the Sultan of Zanzibat? Many pecple in East
Africa have reacted to the revolution’ in Zanzibar where the
government has been overthrown and.‘the Sultan deposed. They
have now formed their own opinions as to whether the coup d'etat
was good or bad. But unfortunately nat much attention has been
paid to the methods or the means used to bring about the
revolution. But for the sake of record and history, itis
good to try to establish whe was responsible for the overthrow-
ing of the government ang setting up a new one; future generations
would benefit by such an exercise, as with the assassination of
President KENNEDY of America, the name of Cubans and Communists
has been drawn in by the western press reporters. Is it true
that the Cubans organized the coup or not? What would: motivate
Cuba to do so? Has Cuba any interest in the islands, if so, what
are they?. “When I went for the Zanzibar Independence Celebnettén,

the government which has been overthrown now, which meant that
the government was friendly to them. But it was there on!
10 December 1963, at the Palace cf the Sultan in front of which
lay the ship SALIFKALIF, which has carried the Sultan away,
that a top ranking British officer who was to leave. Zanzibar
the following day after many years of service there, told: me
that he was gerry, only for one thing, namely, that independence
of Zanzibar had come before the formation of the’ East African
Federation, because he thought Zanzibar might become a Cuba to
the East African mainland, Now how could Cuba’ cverthrow: another
Cuba? Cuba being so far away from Zanzibar, how would the Cubans
get into Zanzibar and by which ship? The truth is that ‘the former
goverament was a socialist government which’ was friendly to
Cairo, Indonesia and Cuba. The following points are of : prime
importance; The British Commissioner of Police, Mr. SULLIVAN,
was not attacked in spite of the fact thdt he was in charge of
the only armed force in the country. The Sultan?s Palace was
mot attacked immediately-unlike in the Russian Revolution. Only
- Indians were in fact reported to have been gaptured and imprisoned
although the British alse owned property on the island. The
British and Americans were reported. quite safe in the European
club. The American Project Mercury’, worth [4 gr G] million,
was never attacked although it is dronical that the Sultan
should now feel that he would be safe in Dar-es-Salaam where
Mr; BABU, who is now the Foreign,Minister, and most probably
Mr. KARUME were, at the beginning of the revolution and from
where, unlike other people they could leave for Zanzibar during
_the revolution, without any apparent difficulty. The former
government asked Lor assistance, but the néw government asked
Tanganyika for medical assistance. Mr. KISASA was immediately
appointed by the revolutionary council, to take over the key and
most strategic position oh Commissioner of Police, a sign of
great confidence.'
