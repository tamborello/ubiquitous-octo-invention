[or contact by CI d@ the continuing investigation of his
past activities the United States Government combined
with his continued steady employment, CARBONELL indicated
ho has had no interest or inclination to become active in
local Cuban affairs or even pes ig bas old contacts in

ot by cise his disappointment at the lack of nawe
y

_ Anti-CASTRO Cuban exile groups. #He has also abandoned
~ for the time being any thought of [traveling to Canada
oy Mexico to contact cxspia the hopes of servi as a
‘Gouble agent for the United States Government e. . |
explained that a deterrent to his international travel — i
has been the fact that United States Immigration authorities :
maintain a book at the Miami International Airport,, ; ;

. Admitting Facility, apparently relating to undesirable i
persons and security risks and his name is carried in this
beok, In the past when he has arrived at Miami and checked :

i in with Immigration, they have held him up for several '
, hours and delayed his admission to the United States. Ts !
CARBONELL readily admitted that he had been in contact : ;
recently with FRANK PEREZ PEREZ and might have told him

that he hoped to do something against the CASTRO regime

but he stoutly denied that he had stated or implied that

he was working with the FBI in this connection. \yv Do

 

. Concerning the 40-page statement. CARBONELL
wrote in May, 1969 and later submitted to the FBI, he ; :
stated that this was prepared to record in an organized. ; i
fashion his best recollections of past political activities, i
in preparing this statement’ CARBONELL had. discussed these
matters at length with his friends ROLANDO MASFERRER and -
PRUDENCIO DUENAS both of whom had ‘closely been associated

in these activities. He had solicited their help-in
recalling certain events and had later furnished them with
parts or all of the finished report explaining that he was
making this information available to the United States |
Government to clarify his position and background... CARBONELL
stated that in his opinion neither MASFERRER nor DUENAS-

were particularly interested in the report, however, and

had not apparently read it. . : .

Periodic spot surveillances during November and
December, 1969 at CARBONELI.'s residence and places fre-
quented by him in the past have failed to develop any
questionable activity on his part suggesting that he
might be currently involved in local Cuban political affairs.

The identity of the special agents conducting
surveillance on April 8, 1965 is appropriately noted in |
the case file. :

The source of information regarding records at
the Pan American Bank, Miami on November 20 and December 24,
1969 was JAMES D,. HAYES who is a retired special agent ~
formerly assigned to the Miami Office presently Admini-
strative Aid to the Chairman of the Board, Pan American
Bank system, Miami.
