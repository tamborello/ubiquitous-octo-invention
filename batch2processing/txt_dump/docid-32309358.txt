» 6. About 2100 hrs. on 21st October the 'AMIGO' went

aground on a reef, remaining fast until 0600 hrs. on 22nd Confidential

October, when the crew and the Americans got it free. They
remained at anchor for about 24 hours in the same area, but
saw nothing of another boat. On the morning of 23rd October
CAMPOS pointed out that he only had fuel for about 5 hours
sailing, and was then told to make for Belize. The eight
men, who were not included on the Progresso Port clearance
certificate, were landed at Shag Caye Bogue, about 12 miles
south east of Belize City, with the major part of the equip-
ment, by means of the dinghy, which they kept with them. The
‘AMIGO' then came into Belize City harbour.

 

The following morning a Police/Military party, guided
ty CAMPOS, went to Shag Caye Bogue and collected the eight men
and their equipment without resistance. All were brought into
Belize City, and all were charged under the Immigration
Ordinance, the Mexican and United States Consulate authorities
again being advised of the situation. On the 24th October the
five U.S. nationals taken from the 'AMIGO' appeared before the
Belize City Magistrate on a charge of being prohibited immigrants.
They were reminded in custody until 3lst October 1968. On 25th
October the eight men, all of whom claimed U.S. nationality,
were Similarly charged and remained until 31st October.

8. When the thirteen men appeared on 31st October, a :
: deportation order to the United States was made in respect
of each. Arrangements were made by the United States Consul
for them to leave on scheduled airline flights in four

REPORT ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE
ARREST AND DEPORTATION FROM BRITISH HONDURAS OF
r THIRTEEN UNITED STATES NATIONALS .
OMIT? MOTE AD
I About 1330 hours on Wednesday, 23rd October 1968 a 34
feet cabin cruiser, the 'AMIGO' registered at Progresso, Yucatan,
Mexico arrived in Belize City harbour with a crew of two Mexican
nationals, Alonso CAMPOS Escalante and Roman MAGANA Estrella,
and carrying five United States nationals as passengers. The
~ Object of the visit was stated to be refuel and re-provision.

_As a result .of information given by CAMPOS to the Customs
authorities, the matter was referred to Police, and Special
Branch officers interrogated the two Mexicans. From the infor-
mation received, the five United States nationals were arrested
and charged under the British Honduras Immigration Ordinance.
The boat was searched and, besides a number of suitcases contain~
ing personal clothing, medical supplies, anti-Castro literature,
maps, documents and United States Armed Forces training manuals,

a pistol loaded with 6 rounds was found hidden in the cabin.

2. The five U.S. nationals gave names and addresses to
Police, but several of the names given were later found to be
false. The Mexican and United States Consulate authorities were
notified of the circumstances known at that time.

3. The two Mexican nationals were questioned separately, and

both told the same story. x NLbf. (Co

4. The AMIGO", owned by Alfonso Martin FASQUEZ of Pi Progresso,
Yucatan, was hired by the five United Statés citizens, with

CAMPOS and MAGANA as crew, for a five-day fishing and sightseeing
trip from Progresso to Isles Mujeres, Yucatan, at a cost of

3,000 pesos. Having obtained port clearance, the party left
Progresso off the 'AMIGO' at about 2200 hrs. on Friday, 18th
October. About 2330 hrs. three of the Américans threatened the
Mexican crew with pistols, and forced them to take the boat
inshore opposite the abandoned hotel 'Tropical Reviera'. Eight
further men, with a considerable quantity of equipment were then
ferried on board by the boat's dinghy. This operation was .
completed about 0300 hrs. on Saturday, 19th October. The ‘'AMIGO'
was then sailed eastwards along the northern coast of Yucatan,
both the Mexican crewmen having been tied up, but released one

at a time to steer the boat. They passed Isles Mujeres about

0400 hrs. on 20th October and turned south: About this time,
according to CAMPOS, he learned that their destination was Belize.

5. When the boat arrived off Xcalak, Quintana Roo, CAMPOS

was told to head for Turneffe. The lighthouse at the northern

end of Turneffe was sighted at about 1830 hrs. on Monday, 21st

October. CAMPOS was told to steer to the east of Turneffe,

| where they would meet another boat which the Americans would
board, leaving the 'AMIGO' and the two Mexican crew to return

to Progresso. :
