For the information of the Bureau, a check of toll calls thd
on telephone available to CIVELLO has not been made since prior to.
July, 1966, As the Bureau is aware, CIVELLO became active in a
proposed deal with FRANK DESIMONE, his cousin and former LCN boss of
the family in Los Angeles, prior to DESIMONE’s death on 8/4/67, An
LA TE informant was also in active contact with CIVELLO regarding
proposed loan from the Teamsters Union to buy the Riviera Hotel in
Las Vegas. CIVELLO recently made a trip to Los Angeles, covered by
that office, While check of toll calls on CIVELLO have not always
been productive, it is believed our intelligence coverage of CIVELLO
would not be complete unless continuing review of his toll calls was
being made, DL 289-C, who is close to and in frequent contact with &
CIVELLO and in CIVELLO's home periodically, has advised that he has
been in CIVELLO’s home on a number of occasions when CIVELLO has
received a number of long distance calls, which CIVELLO would not

call back on a public line, REC g Fa- LF 2 f—|

Other factors to be taken into consideration are the
following: If we do not periodically check such toll records and
it is later determined that a significant Call was made, the record
could have already been destroyed by the telephone company, With
the new system of recording calls being used by Southwestern Bell
Telephone Company, much helpful incidental information is picked up
as noted by the operator on handling a long distance call, JAMES M,
MAUGHAN, Area Security Manager, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company,
and former Special Agent, is well aware of the Bureau's interest in
CIVELLO, and on several occasions has voluntarily offered to make
toll record information available on CIVELLO. It has not been—- =—<| eon
