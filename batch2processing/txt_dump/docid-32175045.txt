Lane and advise that he, this source, knows an individual who :
viewed the assassination of the president and also viewed those
who committed the assassination. STEIFER stated that he knows :
nothing about the assassination other than that what he has ‘
read, however, he believes that he has read sufficient :
material to compose a fiction type story regarding the i
assassination. STEIFER then wants this source to somebody i
such as Mark Lane and if Lane accepts it STEIFER will then :
commence telling his story through this source. STEIFER :
is never to be known to the writer and will never be
in a position to testiy regarding his story.

STEIFER is of the opinion that so many books i

have been written regarding the assassination that any
story could no doubt make thousands of dollars for the

three of them.
