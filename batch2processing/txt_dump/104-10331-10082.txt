Memorandum for the Record

Subject: ARRB Issues/Request ; a

Meeting with ARRB Staff, 5 January 1996

 

   

23 Nov. 1963,)at their 3 August ,
1995 meeting. However, the Board staff has been notified b
Peter Dale Scott, a conspiracy theorist, that thet ae
were released to NARA in an extract from that document (the |
Mexico City Chrono). Marwell and Gunn requested that we' do

a voluntary (consent) release of the,document: They prefer 3
not to sent it back to the Board for action.

2. (Request] Were there any audio “bugs” in the Cuban
Embassy and/or Consulate? ; .

3. Goodpasture Interview: According to Gunn,
Goodpasture says there was a working copy of Oswald's
telephone conversation tape. She heard it and believes it
might have been taken to Dallas by the FBI. She also wrote
some “protest” letters concerning linking the unidentified
man with Oswald.

{NOTE: Goodpasture's comments ties in with Hoover's
comments, which were later denied, that Dallas FBI agents
listened to a tape of Oswald calls; also Warren Commission
staffer Slawson remembers listening to an Oswald tape. To
date we have found no evidence in the JFK collection that
such a tape existed. Also I am not aware of any “protest”
letters from Goodpasture. }

[Request] Marwell ask if there were records that would show
if such “working tapes” were made?

4. Gunn would like to make a joint (CIA/ARRB) visit to
the JFK and LBJ Presidential Libraries in February.
