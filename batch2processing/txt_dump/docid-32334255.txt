"On §/5/69, source advised that CARLOS MARCELLO
“had received a letter from CONNIE CAROLLO requesting money
- from CARLOS and he instructed his secretary to make out a
: $500 check to some church or religious order and had her
_ send it to the CAROLLOS. He then tore up the letter from
CAROLLO so source did not have a chance to examine it.

: On. 5/15/63 source advised that on 5/13/69 CARLOS
MARCELLO had gone to Baton Rouge, La., for an important meeting
with unknown individuals and source does not know the purpose
for this trip. He noted that the Governor had signed DALTON
SMITH's extradition order to California yesterday and NOFIO.
PECORA had requested CARLOS to intercede fo DALTON’ SMITH to
prevent extradition, and this may have been the reason for the
trip. However, CARLOS told source that he only called -
MARSHALL BROWN and BROWN told’ him there was nothing he could

do for SMITH. . :

- Source advised that’ yesterday CARLOS went with his
CPA, JOHN CONNALLY, to meet with some people about the
prospective purchase of Commander's Palace.

amounts to advance payment by WILSON ABRAHAM of some 200,000 r
odd dollars, which represents the purchase price of a piece of | “
land that he recently bought from CARLOS MARCELLO. ~ we
