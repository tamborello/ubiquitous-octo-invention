Baltimore is also furnishing one covy each of the memorandum to
the United States Attorney, Baltimore, Maryland, and to Internal
Revenue Service, Baltimore.
/
Washington Field Office advised by telephone call on June 17,
1963, that at midnight, the night before RH 95-C-TE had furnished
'information that the States Attorney at Leonardtown, Maryland,
planned to take those arrested and run them through on guilty
pleas early that morning before the Grand Jury convenes in order
to get them out on fines only. Informant further stated that all
the gamblers in the area knew that it was FBI pressure which was
responsible for the arrests. The operators felt they were going
to be raided and accordingly, pulled out their roulette wheels
and blackjack table. They also called in the local. Sheriff
and told him their feelings. The Sheriff reportedly assured them
that the States Attorney was on their side and that he thought the
Deputy Sheriff, whom they had attempted to pay off, would take
no action for a few days. In view of this and the amount they
. had invested, they decided to go ahead and hold a crap game
anyway.

Developments as set out in enclosed letterhead memorandum, indi-
eate alleged plans, if actual, were frustrated. This and other
similar corroborative information obtained directly from sub jects

by top level confidential informants of the Norfolk and Washing- .
ton Field Offices, was not included in the memorandum to avoid
compromising the informants. These informants can be especially
valuable in Bureau's continuing investigation to develop inter-
state gambling or bribery violations from evidence so far secured

by the FBI and Maryland State Police.

Baltimore Office made available to Maryland State Police informa-

tion developed, indicating viclations of State statutes, which

had been developed as of June 10, 1963. Arrangements were also

made by Baltimore with the FBI Identification Division for expedi-
tious furnishing to Maryland State Police of past identification
records on principal subjects and for special searching of curr-

ent fingerprint cards on gamblers arrested June 13, 1963. Special ;
Agent THEODORE M, MALINOWSKI was «also made available to furnish i
eritical testimony on June 18, 1963, in St. Marys County Trial -
Magistrate's Court, regarding contact of JOSEPH FRANCIS NESLINE
and CHARLES TOURINE, with Deputy Sheriff BENJAMIN 'H, BURROUGHS,
JR., NA.
