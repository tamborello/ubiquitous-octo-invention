GENERAL INFORMATION

'.No additional information has come to the attention
of. the Legat, Havana, concerning the construction of further
gambling casinos in Cuba.. Sources available to the Havana
Office have indicated that, because of the fall-off in tourist
trade as a result of revolutionary activities, projected con-
struction of additional casinos has been deferred until such
time as the political.situation stablizes itself.

| On. 4/30/58, Hav-31 advised that, as.a result. of con-
| versations with members of the gambling element in Havana, this
4; , Source came to the conclusion that an individual named
PO. +... SALVATORBAFALCONE in Miami may possibly be acting as a mail
drop for ‘communications of importance among members of the
gambling element.

NORMANKFOTINAN, who is operating slot machines in the
interior of Cuba, advised on 5/7/58 that because of recent
revolutionary activities, the slot machine trade had been very
slow and he was having. difficulty retaining trained repair
technicians. He stated, however, that recently there had been
an upsurge in the business. . >

Extra copies of this letter have been prepared for
forwarding by the Bureau to New York, Miami and Salt Lake City.

entry. HERNANDEZ said that JACK LANSKY's refusal of entry by

CARLOSATANTILLO to "shake down" LANSKY... This source informed”
that. friends of LANSKY made contact with SANT IAGOXREY, Cuban

.Minister of the Interior, in an effort)\to ascertain the reason

for LANSKY being refused entry and that when REY found out
CANTILLO was responsible, he had CANTILLO transferred to a
regimental command in Holguin, Cuba. (Thereafter, REY advised
LANSKY's friends that he could return to Cuba whenever he desired.
Lt. HERNANDEZ informed he understands, in return for this "favor,"
a gambling debt which REY had at the casino at the Hotel Nacional . (
in the amount of $20,000 was written off the books. It should
be noted the possibility exists that this matter could have been
an indirect "shake down" on the part of SANTIAGO REY, the affair
being engineered by-him in order to put LANSKY in a position where
the debt would be forgiven. However, in the past, JACK LANSKY
has indicated that SANTIAGO REY has always been a good player at
