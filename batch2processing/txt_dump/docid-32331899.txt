MARTINEZ {she cc said. not: recall which) that information had _
been developed that MARTINEZ was known to have been seen in or
near Steubenville, Ohio, either just before or just after the
date of the theft. She said she believed: MARTINEZ. had been
questioned about this fact, and he had denied béing around
Steubenville on or about | the. pertinent date. :

- Continuing, KRAJCIK: stated that on an unrecalled m@te
in 1 December, 1958, she was talking to MARTINEZ, at which time
he told her he had been to see a friend in or near Steubenville
to get $2500 from him, adding that this friend had owed him —
this money. She said she asked MARTINEZ, "Did you say
Steubenville? Didn't you tell the FBI you were never there?"

To this, according to KRAJCIK, MARTINEZ seemed to realize he
made a slip- in, pis conversation and -then said, "Oh, I mean
Toronto, Ohio." KRAJCIK said shé did not Imow the name of .

the friend in Steubenville or Toronto, and had no way-of knowing
if MARTINEZ was lying about getting the money from him.

KRAJCIK said she deduced from this slip by MARTINEZ that he had
been in Steubinville or Tcronto previously to loan his friend
the money , assuming he was telling her the truth.

as on that date he flew to Cuba... She said he had only about
$15 in his possession, which she loan him, as he had only a
few dollars to his name. She said he ft in a private plane

she furnished ti 2 mumbers as they were on cars which were
‘similar to Fords in description and which were green in color.
(It will be recailed that KRAJCIK was asked if she knew of.
anyone who had 2 green Ford or white Cadillac.) In reviewing
the license nunivers observed on the. cars by her, as she. reported
_them, she said she realized after she furnished the license
numbers of two of the cars, that they were.incorrect. She
said she observed the cars parked beside-the Overlook inn, which
is located next door to her house, and recognized them as .
belonging to employees of Aranair Corporation, and therefore,
friendly with NICK TRIKILIS, as well as being possibly friendly
with MARTINEZ. She said she furnished these license numbers as
‘being on cars which might: have been mistaken. for green Fords.

 

She said she furnished one license number as being
US 641, whereas this number should have beén correctly reported
as US 541. She said this plate is on a 1955 Green Mercury and
belongs to GEORGE DEFFENBAUGH, of Wooster, who works as a
salesman, she believed, for TRIKILIS at. Aranair Corporation. ©
She said VA 959 is on a 1950 two-tone grey Buick which she
thought belonged to JUNICR BRENNEMAN, She added that she has
since found out that Ohio License BU 229 (which she said she
furfiished as VC 229) is not connected with Aranair Corporation
nor is the owner associated with this situation at all. (A
license check of VC 229 reveals that this license is listed to
VEE A. COCCIA, 945 Washington Avenue, Wooster, on a 1954 Ford
Two-door sedan) .
