Preliminary Review of Certain JFK Files (re Conyers rqst)

Boxes 40 to 48. It is my obsevation based on the one box that I
reviewed (48) and conversations with the other reviewers that
most of this group of files consists of Office of Security
files on individuals. As such they are largely biographic and,
in the case of the gangsters involved in Mongoose, heavily
concerned with their legal problems. With some exceptions these
files contain mostly tangential references to operational
matters. They are not a gold mine of information on Castro
Mongoose, and the Bay of Pigs. (Frank)

Box 40 contains OS files primarily on anti-Castro Cubans and
individuals involved in the Garrison case who had Agency
connections or contacts. Also contains several files on Agency
employees involved with anti-Cuba and/or mafia activities. Most
of the files contain bio/file check data on the individual with
little or no information on activities. However, files on
prominent individuals* in the CIA's anti-Castro/Cuba projects
contain some substantive information on activities such as
AMWORLD, JMATE, JMWAVE and recruitment plans.

xManuel ARTIME - AMWORLD project leader

Bradley AYERS - former Agency/ leaks to Jack A. & book

Francisco BARTES - anti-Castro Cuban leader

Charlotte BUSTOS-Videla - Agency employee

David Christ - Agency employee

Viola June COBB - journalist close to Castro (Barry)

Box 41. Similar with less substantive information; most files
individuals involved with Garrison case that had or claimed to
have CIA connections. Box includes file on Fair Play for Cuba
Comm. composed primarily of Congressional hearings. Also a file
on Lucien Conein of Viet Nam fame.

Conclusion:. OS files which are oriented toward individuals'
personal life and security clearance requirements not a good
starting point for substantive info on anti-Castro projects and
Bay of Pigs. *(Barry)-

Box 42 and Box 43 are almost exclusively security bio fles with
little substantive information relevant to Castro, Mongoose,
and the Bay of Pigs. There are five folders on Garrison alone
but these are almost entirely open source material (Honey)

Boxes 44 & 45 contain bio folders- which in turn contain various
references as follows:

References to Castro, anti-Castro, and Bay of Pigs were
found in various news clippings including Washington Post and
NYTimes and in various memos to the Senate Select Committee on
Assassination, (For the Record, blind memos, etc, re names on
police requests). These references could be characterized as
shallow. . (Eileen W.)

Box 46 contains 25 envelopes, essentially on individuals.
Occasional pieces on links with Cuban exile groups.

Envelope 6 concerns Frank Sturgis - focus is Watergate but
there is mention of anti-Castro training, etc.

Envelope 11 concerns Carlos TEDINO Gonzales, alleged CIA,
and his link to two Cuban majors arrested in plot to kill
Castro. No substantive info.

Envelope 15 concerns Manuel Antonia DE VARMEY Loreda,
Cuban exile. File concerns anti-Castro activity in the US,
including info on the Mafia link. (Chuck)

Box 47 contains no relevant official information: 12 envelopes
or folders; envelopes 5-8 (over 1 linear foot) are nothing but
newspaper clippings, some of which relate. (Chuck)

Box 48 is almost entirely security files on individuals
involved with plans to assassinate Castro, but documents
contain mostly their biographies and legal aspects of various
cases against these individuals. Actual information on the
plots is very limited. (Frank)

Microfilm Reels. The three reels mentioned as possible sources a
of information on Cuebela do contain portions of his 201. Reel L
51A probably has the most relevant information, containing

quite a bit on AMLASH, AMWHIP, and AMTRUNK. We also looked at

reel 51 which also has information on Cuebela. (Eileen §S.)
