So, it is not an unusual practice.

Mr. Schwarz. Incidentally, you just let drop one thing
in your testimony a moment ago. You said that in your 25-year
involvement with intelligence matters you had been bothered
by your activities on only two occasions, one of which was
Chile.

And then you said what the other one was. What was that?

Mr. Phillips. I was in Washington attending the Chiefs
of Station course, which is a training course for people who
are going out on their first assignment as Chief of Station.

When President Johnson decided to send 22,000 Marines
to the Dominican Republic, it occurred to me that in order to
protect and evacuate American citizens, that that job might
have been done with 400 Marines. I was scheduled to go there

f And I just wasntt sure that I

wanted to be associated with something like that. But I de-

 

cided, well, I suppose President Johnson knows what he is
-doing, I will go -= I am going to go along. So, I did go
along.

Senator Schweiker. One question on your differentiation
between where you drew a personal commitment line on assassin-
ations, but not overthrow. I have trouble quite understanding

it, because as I understand Chile, the plot was to overthrow

Mr. Phillips. There is no question that I could under--
stand why anyone concerned with world affairs, looking at
Chile and what was happening there, would be concerned.

Salvadore Allende made his first statement saying that
he was a Socialist and wanted to change the order some 32
years beforehe was elected.

Over the years he made it quite clear that he was an ar-
dent socialist. Before this decision was made I believe that
we had a visit from a man who had the code name off
was a Cuban’ intelligence officer.- The Cubans were moving in
rapidly. The influence was great. I think that they saw a lot
at stake, another Cuba in Latin America type of thing, the
same thing perhaps that motivated President Johnson to send
22,000 rather than 400.

So,I can. understand why they thought this was going,
in the long strategic sense, in the “long range against.:our
interests. But that is an assumption.

It- is true that Allende very definitely made it clear
that he wanted to turn Chile into a Marxist state. The differ-
ence was that Allende refused to take Fidel Castro's advice
and use violence. As I understand it, Fidel Castro went to
Chile and said, if you want your revolution to last you are

going to have to use violence.
I found it interesting to read in this morning's paper

where someone from Portugal came back from Cuba and said,

g 2 Mr. Phillips. It never occurred to us in our wildest
2 5 dreams to do that.
4 Mr. Schwarz. I suppose the relationships between con-

5 tinuing intelligence services were things that were

6 very: important to preserve, and that we had very close and

7 delicate relationships with the other.intelligence services.
8 Mr. Phillips. We do. And if there had been such a

9 man{ sd woul be quite unhappy with us. But I

10 thought that was better than letting the world know that was

12 Mr. Schwarz. You go on in the cable of September 27

13 to say this:

14 , "Headquarters believes this false flag was manned by
15 officers who have repeatedly proved their ability to operate
16 | and recruit under false colors, will give Station great flexi-

17 || bility in handling delicate and fast-moving situations secure-

18 ly."

 

19 So, the use of false flag persons, at least judging

 

 

 

20 || from this cable, is something

However, that was it. It was a

devious move. It was the final result -- the idea being that
if such a flap did occur, someone would think it was someone
other than the U.S. The idea of false flag operations is
not a new one. The idea I had of going to someone and saying,
why don't you be a spy for us, I don't work for the Soviets,
is not true.

But this is sort of new, the fact that action agents
should pose as others. And yes, it is devious, but that
was the idea. .

Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Phillips, what were
their instructions if they were to be caught? Were they to go
to their death swearing they were[—idor whatever?

Mr. Phillips. I don't think it was quite that dramatic,
Senator. They came to Washington before they went down. And
I briefed them,and I think what at said to them was, this
is going to be a teiigh and sensitive one, and you don't have
to go if you don't want to, because you culd get in real trouble.

‘And if you get in trouble, I am not sure we can help

So, they shrugged their shoulders and went.

Consequently, I personally made this proposal, that we
establish what I called a false flag base of people that would
go from outside, and should there be any sort of flap, the

chances of linking it to the U.S. Government would be much

less, because they would appear to be from another nationality. |

Mr. Schwarz, I would like to read to. you a cable -- is
this cable of 27 September in the Senator's book? I know that
he asked for it after I came over.

Mr. Treverton. It is not.

Mr. Schwarz. I am going to read from a cable which
unfortunately is not in your book, but the key part is
relatively simple.

This is a cable, Mr. Phillips, dated September 27, 1970,
and it is signed by yourself and Mr. Broe. And it is sent to
the Station in Chile, and it contains the following about the
purposes of setting up the false flag office --

Mr. Phillips. We call it a base.

Mr. Schwarz. False. flag bases: “Each member of base
will enter and leave Chile with falst documents and Operate as
a representative of his country rather than as anAmerican".

That is right, isn't it?

Mr. Phillips. That is true.

Mr. Schwarz. Continue:

“Having at least one key{ ana one key

would be vital, and we have candidates."
