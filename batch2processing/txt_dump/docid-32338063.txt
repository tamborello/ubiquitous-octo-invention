Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan N
Re: ANTI-CASTRO ACTIVITIES IN THE U.S, E 4
IMMEDIATE ACTION RECOMMENDED BY. THE CONFERENCE:
: : Mr. Cottrell made a point of the fact that this conference was
merely to recommend action which might be instituted by the U.S. Govern-
ment to frustrate plans of the Cuban refugees to conduct raids against
Cuba in the immediate future and to recommend action U.S. Government might
take on a longer range basis in an effort to reduce such raids to a bare
minimum. He said it was recognized on the highest levels of our Government

that a one hundred percent elimination of these raids would be an :
impossibility. ;

 

It was made clear by FBI representatives at the conference, who | :
were supported in this respect by Assistant Attorney General Yeagley, that
FBI has no jurisdiction concerning or responsibility for actions of a
preventive nature. Mr. Grapp forcefully explained that Bureau has certain \
intelligence responsibilities to produce information, which we are doing,
in this matter. and that its other responsibilities relate to investigating
activities indicating a possible violation of Federal statutes. With \
respect to the present raids against Cuba, it was pointed out that if the |
Department specifically requests an FBI investigation of an allegation
that a raid is being planned, the investigation is undertaken immediately |
and pursued on a special basis for the purpose of developing facts which | |
can be presented to the Department for its consideration and opinion as —
‘to prosecutive action, L : ' -

Mr. Cottrell then proceeded to direct discussion toward action
which the conference desired to recommend that the President consider. for :
the purpose of stopping cold the raids against Cuba which may be imminent. |
Participants at the conference other than FBI representatives then i
engaged in a lengthy discussion which firmed up the following recommended
actions: :

“ (1) An understanding with Sir Robert Stapleton, Consul General
of Nassau, which would permit personnel of the U.S. Coast Guard to land i
on islands which are British territory for the purpose of checking : |
suspicious boats. A Coast Guard representative at the conference pointed =:
out that there is presently an understanding with Sir Robert permitting
Coast Guard overflights of British territory for this purpose. Cottrell
stated that this action, if approved, would have to be instituted in’ |
Washington. Mr. Grapp learned following the conference that Cottrell
ordered that no landings by the Coast, Guard be effected on British
territory until further notice. Ol 5)

 

(2) State Department to provide INS with blanket authority to
place departure controls into effect against Cuban parolees. It was.
