Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act
of 1992 (the Act)
Synopsis: The Act established the Assassination Records Review
Board (ARRB) to oversee the governments' production and
compliance with the Act. The ARRB reviews the proposed
postponements in documents sent by each agency to the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA)' and decides what
postponements the Act allows or opens the document in full. The
ARRB's responsibilities include having agencies search other
subjects and areas to find any additional material not already
=e) . identified as assassination records. The establishment of the
ARRB by the Act also limited the time for their duties to be
accomplished. The ARRB must complete their tasks by September -
1997. With this deadline in mind, the ARRB sent a letter
requesting additional information.

Enclosures: ARRB letter requesting material.

Details: On March 10, 1997, the ARRB sent a letter to the FBI
setting forth a formal request to receive and review additional
records. The ARRB's goal is to research every possible subject
that may have a bearing on assassination theories and to assure
Congress and the American public that all was done to accomplish
the intentions of the Act.

New Orleans should conduct a search of its office for
the listed items. If New Orleans is aware of any administrative
records they may have maintained outside the normal index system,
they should include those areas in the search. If any documents
related to the matters are found, please forward the documents to
the JFK Task Force.

. eNcKosur Pursuant to the Act, any material categorized as an
assassination record must be sent to the NARA in its original
form. The Act established the process of handling the documents
. and the FBI must follow the Act. If New Orleans needs a copy,
CO they should copy the documents or material before sending to the
