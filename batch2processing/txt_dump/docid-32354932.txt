MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with HSCA Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey :

1. In the course of a meeting with Mr. Blakey this morning, we ©
discussed the method by which questions would be put to the agent
in Mexico, It developed that he has in mind two agents, the one about
whom we knew (Durant) and one with which we were not familiar
(Manuel Calvillo), I think he was not entirely clear as to these two ;
people, although his alternative approaches place on us a requirement
to be sure that we identify them properly for purposes of his questions,
They are discussed below: :

a. {Durant.\ He recalled that(Durant\operated the photo-
graphic surveillance post of the Soviet Embassy. I told
him that I understood that(Durant}was in charge of the
Cuban coverage, :

b. Manuel Calvillo. He understood that Calvillo ran the
Cuban photographic surveillance site, Beyond this,
however, :Calvillo was of interest to him for other _
reasons, Elena Garo dePaz told of seeing Oswald at”
various parties in Mexico’ City, at the time of his
visit there in 19633 ‘She also said that 'h couple of
days" after the assassination of President Kennedy,
Calvillo picked her up, took her to a hotel and inter-

' rogated her.

 

 

 

2. Given the possible confusi
Soviet OPs, Mr. Blakey
correctly identified.and ist the questions addressed to thetn.

   
   
 
 

£_whioi operated the Cuban and

  

3. Additionally, Mr. Blakey want
on Calvillo.
