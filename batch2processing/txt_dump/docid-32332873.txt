JOSEPH BARBARA

The "Pittsburgh Press" of June 18, 1959, carried a front-
page article concerning the death of JOSEPH BARBARA of a
heart attack on June 17, 1959. It stated that BARBARA,

the "sick friend" that sixty gangsters dropped in to see

a

at his Apalachin, New York, home on November 14, 1957,

died of a heart ailment without revealing the secret

purpose of the underworld convention. It noted that BARBARA,
age 53, had been in Wilson Memorial Hospital at Johnson City,
New York, since May 29, 1959, with a-heart attack. The
article further stated that the Sicilian-born BARBARA gave
up both his business and nis home after State Police rounded
up his'guests and that the home was sold for $130,000 during
May, 1959, to a developer who announced plans. to convert it
into a tourist attraction. The article noted that his lingering
illness had prevented his questioning by state and Federal
investigators who have indicted and jailed a number of the
nation's biggest "name" criminals for allegedly lying or
refusing to talk about his hilltop barbecue party.

C. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

Informant Coverage

advised that "young JOHNNY" LA ROCCA, younger brother of

JOHN LA ROCCA, came in from Johnstown, Pa., during the last

days. He stated that from his comments to him at the
apartment in which he is living on one of the nights LA ROCCA
was in Pittsburgh, he understood that one purpose of his
extended stay was to confer with the elder LA ROCCA. He
advised that the appearance of both LA ROCCA and GABRIEL
