C Re: 62-HQ-1029205, 10/11/1996

Within Kansas City' files, the original serials have
been replaced with copies.

Kansas City was further directed to review the enclosed
serials and, if the records concerned electronic surveillance, to
identify the name and jurisdiction of the judge approving the
electronic surveillance, any docket number or case name
associated with the information, the location and duration of the
electronic surveillance, and the subject of the electronic
surveillance. ;

Pursuant to instructions provided by Ms. Wilkins,
Kansas City need not be concerned with the requested descriptive
information concerning electronic surveillances as all the
enclosed serials were prepared prior to enactment of Title III of
the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.

Additionally, Ms. Wilkins advised that prior to the
enclosed records being provided to the ARRB, the records will be
reviewed and all information which could potentially identify -

. human confidential sources will be redacted in accordance with
the legislation establishing the ARRB. This is of particular
importance to Kansas City, as the descendants of the subjects

' identified in the enclosed documents continue to participate in

C) organized crime activities and the descendants of the sources

identified continue to provide information to this Division.
Consequently, the release of information concerning sources in
the enclosed documents, whether the identified source is alive or
deceased, could negatively impact pending investigations within
the Kansas City Division and jeopardize the safety of the
source's relatives.

in the event Headquarters is unable to process the
enclosed records to delete human confidential source identifying
information, it is requested that Kansas City be provided
specific instructions to comply with the applicable legislation
and the records be returned for processing by this Division.
