; (11) Attached is a. copy of General Lansdale'’s
memorandum dated 20 September 1962 which was in re-
sponse to the memorandum referred to in the above
paragraph. My operational notes reflect that this
memorandum, after receipt, was discussed with Lansdale
and the major question was whether or not the team
could not have performed an alternate mission at the
time it was inside. He was advised orally that in
view of operational conditions it could not have.

memorandum to Lansdale.

(16) My operational diary reflects that Lansdale
was briefed on 17 October 1962 on our plans to re-run
the Matahambre Operation within the ensuing few days.

: — (19) My operational diary reflects a long dis-
cussion on 20 October 1962 with: Lansdale, in which he
was specifically told that we were re-running the.
Matahambre Operation and that the Matahambre Operation
along with the Galefre Bridge Operation, which we
then were still considering, were the only two sabotage
operations which we felt we could undertake at that
time in view of the changed conditions.

(21),. (22), (23), (24) This chronology was ‘not

fully known to Lansdale at. the time, nor was it
fully known to Task Force W until the return of the
operational team to the Miami area on 24 October,

The 24 October 1962 Weekly Report which
contained the general comment on this operation
did go to Lansdale's office and other appropriate
members of the Special Group (Augmented).

(28) I have carefully questioned Mr. Halpern,

distinctly recalls advising Lansdale orally on the
morning of 26 October 1962 that the Matahambre
Operation had been re-run; that we had not heard
from the team; had not been able to recover the team,
and must presume the team to be either lost or in

hiding.

(29) ‘The mention of the Matahambre Operation,

as best I can recall, at the meeting of the Special
Group (Augmented) came up in an aside, I believe .
from General Taylor, who asked in effect, "Whatever
happened to that sabotage operation", and was advised
orally that it had been re-run; that the caching part
of the operation had been successful, but that the
sabotage team had not been heard from the must be

. a. With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's
memorandum as reflected by reference chronology,
the statement that Operation Mongoose had had no
- information on this operation since early October
was patently false. Specific reference is made to
the penultimate paragraph in Lansdale's memorandum
concerning a report from CIA which he used as a
basis for a memorandum dated 31 October 1962 to
Mr, Roswell Gilpatric. This refers to the tele-
phonic conversation on the evening of 30 October
1962 between Lansdale and Mri Bruée'Cheever’, Deputy
