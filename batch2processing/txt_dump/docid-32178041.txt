being located at Tacubaya 204. This appears to be an entrance to
the Soviet: Embassy compound and gives access to both the
building where. the Soviet Embassy | is located andthe building
housing the Soviet Consulate. uU

Concerning procedures exercised by the Cuban Embassy
and Consulate in Mexj overning and controlling travel from K)
Mexico to Cub sua ytea it is his impression that in every .
case an application’ a Cuban visa, no matter what kind of
visa, has to be cleared with the Foreign Office in Havana.
He said that the visa applicant who desires to visit or live
-in Cuba is required to furnish the name of a person in Cuba
who knows the applicant. More recently, Mexican applicants
for Cuban visas have been required to give politically acceptable
references in Mexico.

& wy

visa for Cuba must be utilized or the period which the transit
visa authorizes the traveler to remain in Cuba once he has
arrived there. £
