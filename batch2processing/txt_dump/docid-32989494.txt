UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535
May 28, 1975
MEMORANDUM TO ALL EMPLOYEES

RE: INTERVIEWS OF FBI EMPLOYEES

All employees are advised that Congress is conducting
an inquiry into activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Congressional staff members are conducting interviews of former
and current FBI employees. This Bureau has pledged its cooperation
with the Congress.

You are reminded of the FBI Employment Agreement
(copy attached) with which you agreed to comply during your employment
in the FBI and following termination of such employment.

Also, you are reminded of Title 28, Code of Federal
Regulations, Section 16.22 (copy attached), which reads as follows:

"No employee or former employee of the Department of
Justice shall, in response to a demand of a court or other authority,
produce any material contained in the files of the Department or disclose
any information relating to material contained in the files of the Department,
or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as part of
the performance of his official duties or because of his official status
without prior approval of the appropriate Department official or the
Attorney General in accordance with Section 16,24."

Also, you are reminded of Department of Justice Order
Number 116-56, dated May 15, 1956, (copy attached) which, among
other things, requires an employee upon the completion of his testimony
to prepare a memorandum outlining his testimony.

Our cooperative efforts, of course, must be consistent
with the above cited authority. Therefore, if you are contacted for
purpose of interview or testimony you are to request approval as
required by the Employment Agreement and await authorization before
furnishing information, testimony, or record material.
