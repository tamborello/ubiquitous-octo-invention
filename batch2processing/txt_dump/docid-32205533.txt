with theSoviets are unlikely to be fruitful. Actions wi th
respect to Cuba which may contribute substantially to
creating a situation cal ling for United States wilitary
action should be withheld until the Seviet combat units

have been removed from Gubsa or efforts be suace the

 

USSR to remove them have failed.
