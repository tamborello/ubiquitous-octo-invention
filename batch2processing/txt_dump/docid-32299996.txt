"Dr. HECTOR GARCIA GODOY

Provisional President of the Dominican Republic
National Palace i

Santo Domingo

"Mr. President:

"I am writing this letter a few hours after my

‘arrival in Miami in order to explain clearly and

definitely my position in regard to the recent events
in which I.found myself involved.

"The Dominican people are aware that, thanks to
my loyalty during the grave events which began on
April 24, our country is not completely dominated by
Communism at this time.

"An elementary sense of honor as a military man
prevents me from accepting the position of Consul
General in Miami for a Government which has availed
itself of foreign troops to send me into exile by
force. I told this to Generals ALVIN and. PALMER
when they notified me that ZI was Consul in Miami.

"The afternoon that Generals ALVIN and PALMER
informed me that I was to leave and a Lieutenant
in the United States Army prevented me from going’
to my hdéuse to pick up my clothes and my passport,

_I firmly decided that I would not serve your

Government, either in the Consulate of Miami or
in any other position.

"Never did I imagine that a military man of
my rank would be taken to the airport dressed in
full. uniform and. taken out of the country with a
bayonet at his back.

"The United States officials who ordered my
departure from Dominican territory in such a
humiliating manner have dealt the death blow to
the fight for Democracy in America. Can you
imagine the effect that this action against my
person by the 0.A.S. and the United States
Government will have on the military men of. Latin
America? .

"Do you believe that the military men of
Latin America will be. disposed to fight against
Communism when: they know that they will be paid
for doing their duty by being expelled from their
country and ousted from their military career?

‘When the United States troops arrived in the
Dominican Republic, after the men under my command
had been violently attacked by a Communist crowd,
seeking vengeance and death, I never imagined that
those same troops, making common cause with the
enemies of Democracy would remove me from my country
in a way which does little credit to those who call
themselves the leaders in the fight for the survival
of the Western World.

"I arrived in Miami without a passport, without
money and with a suit given to me by the soldiers
at Fort Amador in Panama, but I still have my dignity
and my name. Men who are fighting for an ideal can-
not be destroyed, and even. though they may be
physically eliminated that ideal will reamin
inalterable.

"I have always been an honest soldier and the
U..S. Intelligence services know that for they have
searched all the banks in the world for evidence to
besmirch my reputation.

"At this moment, Z find myself obliged to break
up my home,to sell my furniture amd my house arid to

leave my family. In order to maintain that home

which I will have to start up again in exile, I have

MARCOS DIAZ is the brother of PEDRO
LUIS DIAZ LANZ, former chief of the Cuban
-Air Force under FIDEL CASTRO. MARCOS DIAZ .
LANZ defected from Cuba at the same time as
his brother PEDRO, when PEDRO d ced CASTRO
as a Communist in about 1960. HL)

MM T-3 has known FRANK FIORINI for
approximately six or seven years and described
FIORINE as a U. S. citizen closely associated
with the DIAZ brothers in anti-CASTRO activities
Since 1959. Previous to 1959, FIORINI associated
with the DIAZ brothers in smuggling weapons into
Cuba on b if of FIDEL CASTRO during the BATISTA
regime. afi) ‘ .

MM T-3 described both MARCOS DIAZ LANZ and
FRANK FIORINI as individuals who have become pro-
fessional opportunists and who have attempted to
enrich themselves by associating with anti-CASTRO
and anti-communist elements. At the present time,
MARCOS DIAZ LANZ is- in desperate financial straits.
It is the opinion of MM T-3 that the significance
of MARCOS DIAZ LANZ’ and FRANK FIORINI's contacts
with General ELIAS WESSIN relates to their intention
of exploiting the resources and facilities 90
General WESSIN for their own personal gain. wf)

On September 17, 1965, General ELIAS WESSIN advised
Special Agerits of the FBI as follows:

The newspaper article stating that he was deported
from the DR at bayonet point is a figure of speech but WESSIN
reiterated that he was forcibly retired and deported. WESSIN
indicated that a newspaper article indicating that he
intended to move to Puerto Rico and organize Dominicans
against the provisional Dominican government is without
fact since he did not release this information to the press
and has no plans at the present time other than to await
the arrival of his family in Miami, Florida. WESSIN made
available a letter that he directed to the provisional
leader of the Dominican government, HECTOR GARCIA GODOY.

A translation of this letter is as follows:

under the command of General FRANCISCO CAAMANO had demanded
his departure from the DR as a basis for further negotiations
to settle the Dominican crisis. WESSIN thus believes that

the United States acceded to these demands by the "communists."
WESSIN .pointed.out that although he referred to CAAMANO

forces as "communist," United States military officials
referred to them as “constitutionalist" forces.

WESSIN fears the rapid expansion of communist
influence in the DR and cited as an example the appointment
on September. 16, 1965, of MIGUEL SOTO as Secretary of Labor.
This individual is a supporter of JUAN BOSCH and has made
public statements which WESSIN believes reveal his communist
ideals. WESSIN, however, could not recall the specific text
of these statements and emphasized that while he had no
documented proof of SOTO’s communist affiliation, he never-
theless considered him as at least a communist sympathizer.

Another example of expanding communist influence
in the DR is typified by the present Director of Passports,
name unknown, who is believed by WESSIN to be communist
because he instructed the deletion from Dominican. passports
of a stamped prohibition of travel to iron curtain countries.

WESSIN pointed out that his immediate future plans
consisted of remaining in Miami, Florida, and awaiting his
family from the DR. He has no intention of accepting the
consular post proffered to him by the Dominican provisional
government. He intends to live off of a pension awarded to
him as a retired military officer.

- It is noted that on September 15, 1965, Special
Agents of the FBI observed that MARCOS DIAZ LANZ was in
contact with General WESSIN at thé residence of ANTONIO
LLANO. MONTES. On September 17, 1965, DIAZ LANZ was again

’ observed in contact with General WESSIN, along with FRANK
FIORINI. -

On September 17, 1965, MM T-3, a Cuban

exile who is personally acquainted with MARCOS ‘
DIAZ LANZ and FRANK FIORINI, advised as toxsows: yf)

On September 15, 1965, General ELIAS WESSIN Y WESSIN
was located at his temporary residence, the home of ANTONIO
LLANO MONTES, 751 Swan Avenue, Miami Springs, Florida.

On May 19, 1965, MM T-2, a Cuban exile
familiar with activities in the Miami Cuban.
colony in Miami, Florida, and acquainted with
certain phases of pro and anti-CASTRO activities
throughout Latin America; advised that ANTONIO
LLANO MONTES was the editor of a monthly magazine
entitled "Carteles," which was then published in
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. MM T-2 .
described this magazine as anti-CASTRO in tone,
whose director was listed as RAFAEL BONILLA AYBAR.
The Miami editor at that time was listed as
VICENTE S. PUJALS.

On September 15, 1965, General ELIAS WESSIN Y WESSIN
advised Special Agents of the FBI as follows:

He does not intend to accept a consular post in
Miami, Florida, which was assigned to him by Brazilian General
HUGO: ALVIN at the time he was deported from the DR. WESSIN
‘stated that the details of his expulsion from the DR were
essentially correct as reported by the local press, to wit:

He was approached by Generals DEAN and PALMER of
the U. S. Armed Forces and Brazilian General HUGO ALVIN, the
ever-all military commander in the DR. His offices were
surrounded by armed units/of the U. S. Armed Forces and he
was directed by General ALVEN to relinquish his command to
his. first subordinate. Because of the display of armed
force, WESSIN realized that to resist would have meant.
additional bloodshed in the DR and undoubtedly, would
result in the wounding or death of his own troops, who
he believed would have remained loyal to him. Recognizing
the futility of resistance and to save his own troops, he
relinquished his command as ordered.’

_ WESSIN stated that United States Generals DEAN
and PALMER advised him that the "constitutionalist" forces

This letterhead memorandum has been classified
"CONFIDENTIAL" because it contains information from informants
. of continuing value. Unauthorized disclosure of this infor-
mation could result in compromising these sources and affect. |
the national defense. ; -
General WESSIN's letter to HECTOR GARCIA GODOY was
translated by Miami translator SOPHIE SALIBA. -

General WESSIN was interviewed on 9/15/65 and
9/17/65 by SAs EDWARD J. DAHL and EUGENE L. PAYNE in the ;
Spanish language inasmuch as WESSIN claims ‘to speak no English.

WESSIN expressed admiration for the Bureau as the
only serious agency in Florida. He stated he would be avail-
able for future interviews by Bureau representatives. .

° ; .
WESSIN appears tired and remote. He is undoubtedly |
bitter, as expressed in'several press releases, toward U.S. :
authorities since he believes the U. S. betrayed his efforts .
in the Dominican Republic.

As noted in the enclosed letterhead memorandun,
WESSIN on 9/15/65 was encountered at the residence of ANTONIO
LLANO MONTES, in company with Cuban exile MARCOS DIAZ LANZ,
Bufile 105-80115. On 9/17/65, MARCOS DIAZ LANZ and FRANK
PELORINI, Bufile 2-1499, were observed in contact with General
WESSIN., On 9/17/65, LLANO MONTES advised that individuals, ~
mostly Cuban exiles whom he has not been in contact with for_
more than three years, ’have continually, appeared at, his
residence or telephonically contacted him in an effort to .
gain access to General WESSIN. WESSIN has been thus occupied
during most of his waking hours with these contacts, as well
2s with widespread representatives of local and national «= -
press, radio and television. This situation will more than
likely continue for some time. Because of the situation it
regarding DIAZ LANZ and FRANK FIORINI, as described inthe
enclosed letterhead memorandum, it is possible that WESSIN'’s
attitudes will undergo a change if and when he perceives
their intention to exploit WESSIN's own anti-communist ~. -
ambitions. . oat : ; “ Do a
