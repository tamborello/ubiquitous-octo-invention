MC 89-6

Immigration authorities would await the outcome of a check

with United States police agencies to decide on LOPEZ GUERRERO's
deportation ary (Yh ie any sentence he might receive as a result
of his arrest. tu

In a Foreign Police Cooperation case, which was
immediately opened under the name of GABRIEL LOPEZ GUERRERO
(MC 163-3990), the FBI Identification Division furnished LOPEZ
GUERRERO's arrest record which accounts for his aliases under
FBI No. 265951A. The arrest record verifies his admitted arrests
and showed him not to be wanted by any agency. This information
was furnished to SANTANA JIMENEZ on 2/15/65. SANTANA JIMENEZ
stated that LOPEZ GUERRERU would probably be deported to the
United States within a week. He also stated that LOPEZ GUERRERO
mentioned to him that upon his deportation to the United States,
he would probably return to his home in Beaumont, Texas. (gy)
