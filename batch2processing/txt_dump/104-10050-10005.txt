as. I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and 1 Yugoslav line. The basekouse listening post had a live

noaltor who made short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily
resume vhich was received each day arourd 8 awn. (passed by Flick to Goods sasture
to get to Scott ovefore 9.a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station in the same way, however,
there was usually a time lag of a day or so.” Those transcripts which hdd
Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening
