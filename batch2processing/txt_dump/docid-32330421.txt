KIDNAPPING - CONSPIRACY | SSIFIED BY
INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA ‘a S

Mrs. Catherine, aff es “who has been volunteering data to
us for some time re Cuban Situation, recently furnished Miami
information concerning kidnapping plot by Cuban agents against
Yasferrer, Prominent Cuban exile in Miami. Acting on data supplied
Cy Taaffe, Miami Office placed Special Agent (posing as corrupt local
4, Police officer) in touch with subjects on 1/27/60 and, when Agent
was propositioned to assist in abduction of; Masferrer, Miami '
arrested Valdes and Fernandez on kidnapping-conspiracy charge. Fernande
is identical with MM 635-S, heretofore a valuable paid security
informant of Miami; however, informant was not known to have been
involved in plot until time of arrest. Fernandez claims that he had
no prior knowledge of kidnapping scheme and no opportunity to: advise.
Miami Office of plot before his arrest. Mrs. Taaffe claims that
' scheme was first broached to her in mid January, 1960, by Valdes

and two unidentified Cuban Agents in Havana. By cable 2/4/60

Legat, Havana, has now reported that official of Cuban National Police
has advised U. S. Embassy official in Havana that subjects,‘ both

of whom are connected with Cuban police agencies, acted entirely on
their own and without official sanction in this matter. According

to this Cuban official, Mrs. Taaffe, who is known to Cubans as agent
for Cuban counterrevolutionary group supported by Dominican

Dictator Trujillo, originated the plot against Masferrer and recruited
Fernandez and Valdes. This source further reported that Mrs. Taaffe's |
