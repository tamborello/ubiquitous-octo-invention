of a partnership with DRAYTON DIXON. .He furnished capital

of $35,000 ($10,000 from a mortgage on his home, the rest
savings) and DIXON furnished about $26,000 to the partnership.
According to Mr. LOVIG, DIXON sold one of two houses he owned .
to raise the $26,000. According to Mr. LOVIG, DIXON is a
chemist for Robbin Industries and lives and works in Cleveland,
Ohio, but comes to Stone Park occasionally on week ends to
assist in the operation of the restaurant.

QSSQYreee

Mr. LOVIG pointed. out that the restaurant has been
leased from CHARLES PIZZO on a ten year lease and that as
soon as the restaurant is on solid financial footing it is
DEXON's intention to resign from his job and assist in the
operation of the restaurant. oo. u

Mr. LOVIG emphasized that no hoodlums or, in fact,
any parties other than DIXON and he, have any interest :
whatsoever in the restaurant, and that he has never been
approached by anyone offering to buy a part or all of the
restaurant. Mr. LOVIG stated that his auditor is one PHIL
SARATELLA with the Chicago Business Service and he has
complete knowledge of the financial stnucture of the restaurant
as he handles all books and completes the income tax returns
for both he and DIXON. Mr. LOVIG stated that if there is .
any doubt as to the financing of the Country Fair Restaurant
he would.be willing to make available, through Mr. SARATELLA,
all financial records pertaining to the. restaurant.

frequented the Villa Venice from about April to September,
1958 during which time she came to know many of the personnel
employed at the Villa. _According to this informant the real
boss of the Villa Venice is SAM GIANCANA, for when he would
appear on the scene everyone would "snap to attention." .
GIANCANA would inspect the place and would severely reprimand
any of the staff, including the ostensible owners, JAMES and
STELLA MEO, if the place or they themselves were not clean.

"MORETTI still was basking in what he thought
GIANCANA's esteem on April 18, 1957, when three men got
into MORETTI's car. Later that day his body was found
in the trunk of his car near. Jojliet. He had been beaten,
shot, and strangled. Police found no documents or papers
in MORETTI's clothing. The only item on his body was a
comb, This, it was said, was left by his killers to
indicate that he had been combed clean, something the
slayers of MARCUS neglected to do with their victim".

Coin Machines ; !

. ‘It has been previously reported that
Operator of the Valley Music Company: in Aurora, Illinois,
advised that he had been contacted by. ROCKY PRANO regarding
the Syndicate taking over his jukebox business. PRANO has,
been described as a lieutenant for GIANCANA in far western’
suburbs of Chicago particularly in the realm of jukebox
and pinball machine business.

Chicago T=-10 advised in October, 1958, that during
the summer of 1956, he had been contacted at various times
iby from two to six men who claimed they represented the
Syndicate and advised him that they were going to take over
a certain territory. These men indicated an interest in
coin machines, mostly bowling, pool, and pinball machines.
These men called themselves "field men" and claimed that
they have ‘been studying coin-machine and jikébox operation,
in Kane County for several weeks and knew all about the
operation, including the spots where the machines were
located and the take from each machine. These men advised
the informant that they were "cutting themselves in" on his
business, ; : -

 

Informant stated that he then went to the Sheriff
of Kane County, Mr. HOWARD KELLETT, who advised the
informant that his, the informant's, position was © very
bad one and concluded that -his. only chanee:to survive was
to deal with these unidentified field mén. -Informant
related that he had no choice but to accept the proposition
and as a result is now working for ROCKY: PRANO.
