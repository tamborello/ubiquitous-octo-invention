RE: ASSASSINATION OF
JOHN F. KENNEDY ~
NOVEMBER 22, 1963
DALLAS, TEXAS ’

By letter dated October 20, 1978, the United States
Secret Service, Miami, Florida, furnished to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), Miami, a copy of a letter sent to
that agency by the United States Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion (DEA), Miami, Florida, dated October 13, 1978. The DEA
letter advised that an informant for DEA had indicated that
he was acquainted with Frank Sturgis of Watergate Notoriety,
and during a conversation Sturgis told the informant that he
had killed President John F. Kennedy. This remark was supposed
to have been made in the presence of an individual by the
name of Bill Johnson. DEA advised that this informant could
be made available for interview.

On November 7, 1978, Peter F. Gruden, Inspector in
Charge, DEA, Miami, Florida, advised that the informant in
this matter was Thomas Joseph Holt. Gruden stated that Holt
was of questionable reliability, irrational, unpredictable,
and described him further as a murderer and perjurer. He
advised that the only reason Holt was an informant for DEA
at this time was that Holt had furnished information of internal
nature. Gruden advised that David R. Wiser, Inspector, DEA,
Miami, could furnish more details concerning Holt. .

On November 8, 1978, David R. Wiser advised that

Holt had come to DEA and had made allegations of wrongdoings

against a DEA Agent. Wiser advised that to date the internal

investigation in this DEA matter has not uncovered any evidence

to indicate any truth to the allegations of Holt. He advised '

that the evidence to date indicates to the contrary. .
' Wiser advised that Holt had stated that during the late ‘

summer 1978, he (Holt) was on Biscayne Boulevard in the downtown '

Miami area, when he came upon Frank Sturgis, who was accompanied

by one Bill Johnson. Wiser advised that Holt stated that during .

RE: ASSASSINATION OF
JOHN F. KENNEDY ,
NOVEMBER 22, 1978 \
DALLAS, TEXAS

this encounter, Sturgis stated that he had killed John F. :
Kennedy. Wiser stated that he asked Holt "Why would Sturgis ,
; impart this interesting bit of news to Holt who was a
known government witness and publicized DEA informant from
the past?" And Holt replied that it was " one hit man to
another". Wiser advised that Holt had indicated an intention
to go to the news media regarding his allegations against the
DEA. Wiser further stated that he thought it likely that
Holt would also make mention of the Sturgis comment, in that
he had reported this to DEA, and that they had done nothing
about it. Wiser advised for this very reason he wrote a memo
concerning what Holt had reported, and for this reason it was
furnished to the Secret Service.

Wiser made available a copy of this memo dated |
October 4, 1978, which is attached.

Wiser further stated that in a case in which Holt was

a witness for the prosecution Holt had allegedly called a
defendant during a trial and told him he was going to "get him".
The defendant in this matter, at the time of the call, had a
recording of his telephone call made which was played for the
presiding judge. Holt denied making the call to the defendant,
and the judge ruled that Holt's testimony could not be permit-
ted.

i On November 9, 1978, Wiser had advised that Bill
Johnson was William J. Johson, date of birth March 11, 1931,
FBI number 133677C, last known address 1890 N.E. 118th Road,
Miami, Florida.

On November 31, 1978, Wiser advised that Holt had
been polygraphed on three occasions by DEA on November 30, 1978,
and he had failed the three polygraphs concerning his allegations
about DEA.
