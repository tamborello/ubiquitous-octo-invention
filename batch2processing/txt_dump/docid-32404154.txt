MEMORANDUM FOR: . Director of Central Intelligence
Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

FROM: ; David D. Gries
Director, Center for the Study of
Intelligence
; 4 ; .
SUBJECT: Comments on Draft Decision Memo on Taskâ€™

Force on Procedures for the Public Release
of Information Under FOIA, Privacy Act, and
Other Programs

1. I strongly endorse your decisions on the task
force's recommendations. They should provide a potential
basis for strengthening the Agency's release programs. In
_ particular, I would strongly support additional resources
for the DO; their lack of resources has caused recurring
bottlenecks in the Historical Review Program and other
programs for public release of Agency information.

2. I have one specific recommendation. The section
dealing with the relationship of the C/IRP to the Historical
Review Group (paragraph 2, b on page 2) could be interpreted
as providing C/IRP authority to weaken the Group's release
guidelines (which were established in accordance with your
guidance that the program be "biased toward declassifica-
tion"). I suggest that the following be added at the end of
the paragraph: "This is not. to result in a weakening of the
guidelines for release of historical documents or a ;
lessening of HRG's authority to release as described in
HR 70-14."
