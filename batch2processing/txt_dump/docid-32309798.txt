Davidson continued by relating that about a year ago
he had cold "Frank" and the "General" that "Frank should not have
done that" because, whether it was right or wrong, Drew Pearson
would put.it in the paver and it could cause embarrassment.
Davidson thought the matter was probably being brought up at this
time because of the "foreign agents investigation,"

As possibly connected with ‘the above, it is noted that.
Drew Pearsin’s column in the February 13, 1963, issue of.the™
“Washington Post and Times Herald" reported that Senate probers
ezhad unearthed two political contributions from the brothers
Luis and Anastasio Somoza, President and Secretary of Defense,
respectiv , of Nicaragua, One of the contributions was a
$10,000 naynent to the 1960 campaign of President Kennedy, who
kuew nothing concerning it, The other was a payment of $1,500
to the election campaign of Representative Daniel J. Flood,
Peansylvania, According to Pearson, these contributions were
wade through Frank Berry, a registered Nicaraguan agent.
