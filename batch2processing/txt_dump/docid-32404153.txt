‘We have no major comments on the draft decision
memorandum. I would suggest one relatively minor change,
however. On page 2, paragraph. b, regarding the placement of
the Historical Review Group, I would like to see the wording
be a bit more open-ended. When we fully establish a CIO and
its subordinate organizations, it might make sense to place 4
the HRG in that structure. Accordingly, I would insert in
the first sentence of paragraph b after the word :
intelligence, "for tHe time being."
