Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a pane? truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes. . ,

The Station also conducted aj |mait intercept operation,

LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American case officer.

coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

“Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street ‘on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
“LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an exper imental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
’ tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was ;
| being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
: graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the ‘same side of the ‘Street as the LIMITED site but in-the middle of |
‘the block south. It had a planted view of the front gate of the Soviet :
Embassy. LICALLA, the third Photographic site, was located in one of a
“row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.
This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
"purpose of this operation was. to get good identification Photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by. a re-
- cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American nother
“and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
, LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. | The film was. then de-
“veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips: “LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early {19 (1959) due to the resig- —
nation of a technician, .this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

“processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

1. On_2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie , Goodpasture
visited the Record's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search of additional photographs of the :

_ “unidentified man''. We were unable to locate any such
photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have
been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and
that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters

 

for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed

and pertinent notations re re-use of the old folders:
