“PG 92-228-Sub 2
APPENDIX
Details Of Proposed Installation

Pursuant to Bureau instructions to survey all possibilities
for technical coverage on the subject, investigation disclosed -
that subject frequents The Pines Motel, 4199 Leechburg Road,
New Kensington, Pa., on two or three evenings each week, usually
during the latter part of the week, where he occupies room-unit
#6 and stays for four to five hours with his paramour-secretary
of many years standing. Informants advise that his paramour-
secretary. handles many'of his affairs; that they themselves
engage in illicit relations; and that he indulges in "sniffing"
‘ cocaine. It is believed that when together in the motel they
converse relative to his racketeering and gambling affairs
as well as the affairs of his associates, including those of
his brother, GABRIEL MANNARINO. Both the subject and his ;
brother have been selected by the Department of Justice as two
of their top "forty" subjects. ; ;

Investigation reflects no indication that the owner of this
motel is uncooperative or loyal to the subject. He has advised
that during the previous year he has had several semi-permanent
residents in various units which cause no concern to the subject.

It is proposed that.misur coverage be afforded room-unit #6.
until 1/15/62, at which time subject is required to appear in
U. S. District Court at Chicago, Illinois, where he will be
tried in connection with the Bureau's case entitled "BERNARD
J. EZHAYA; ET AL. ITSP-MT." :

Due to the fact that the location of this motel is approximately
23 wire miles from the Pittsburgh Office control plant and

it would be a major job to provide an additional drop line into
the motel from the existing aerial cable, it is believed that
the monitoring operation at another room-unit in the motel is
the most feasible means and will, of course, afford maximum
security. y

The Pines Motel, owned and operated by CLIFFORD HUTCHINSON,
is located at 4199 Leechburg Road, New Kensington, Pa. This
prick motel is located on a one acre tract of land facing - !
Leechburg Road and is set back from the road at an approximate

distance of 200 feet. The motel consists of the-private living

quarters and related office space of the owner, and separates

three.room-units (Nos. 1, 2 and 3) on the left and three
additional room-units (Nos. 4, 5 and 6) on the right. The
private living quarters are occupied by the owner and his wife.

The motel has private business service, telephone numbers
EDison 9-6611 and EDison 9-6612, which feed into a console
“switchboard in his office. All incoming and outgokng calls
from the room-units are handled through this console as are
individual calls made from one room-unit to another room-unit.

The two drop lines servicing the motel are fed onto the
premises from an aerial cable located on Leechburg Road. There
are three telephone poles on the premises supporting the

incoming lines to the motel. The two drop lines are located
on the last pole, number 961/3, and enter an outside terminal
pox located on the rear exterior wall of the motel where they
are fed into the console. Individual room-unit connections to
the room-units are egressed into this terminal box from the
console where they are fed by individual beige JKT wire into
the respective room-units. These individual wires are strung
along the rear wall of the motel under the eave and each
enters a room-unit by way of an individual metal duct where |
they emerge individually in a wall box which houses a beige: 42A ‘
block. The wall box has a face plate concealing the 42A block
and the. instrument cord emerges through this face plate.

It is proposed that two pair beige JKT wire be used to replace {
the existing one pair beige JKT wire egressed from the outside
terminal box to room-units 1 and 6. In each instance one pair !
of the two existing pairs will be utilized for the respective ‘
instrument's service whtle the second pair will be bridged and
monitoring will be effected in room-unit #1. The 42A block -
‘in room-unit #6 will be replaced by the Mate unit. In this

regard the monitoring agent will utilize a suitable pretext |
when registering at the motel as an out-of-state salesman. :
This installation can be made any day between the-hours of
9:00 and 11:30 under full security measures.

 

Bureau authority is requested to immediately effect this |

installation, and to rent room-unit #1 at The Pines Motel at the i
rate of $35 per week from the date of installation through 1/15/62.
At the conclusion of each night's monitoring operations the
recording equipment will be removed from room-unit #1. -
