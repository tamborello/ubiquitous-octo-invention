The following information was received from former
MEZ-18 and MEX-19, but is being included in the Administrative
section of this report rather than the dissemination section
since it shows close association with the subjects to an
extent which would assist in identifying the informants.

 

Informants advised on 5/12/64, that on 5/5/64,
MEX-18 had accompanied GERTRUDE SOLTKER (Bufile 100-271396),
who was visiting in Mexico, on a shopping trip, at which time
they went to CHARLES SMALL's store. When they visited the
store, DAVID DRUCKER was present having a heated argument with :
SMALL and complaining loudly about the impositions he had
suffered. SMALL alternately agreed and disagreed with him.
According to source, the person being discussed noisily as -
the source of DRUCKER's troubles was MARGARET LARKIN. After
DRUCKER's departure, MEX-18 introduced SOLTKER to SMALL, and
it appeared that each had heard of the other. SOLTKER and
SMALL discussed the family of MORTON SOBELL, convicted atomic
spy,:and SMALL stated that SYDNEY SOBELL, apparently one of
the SOBELL daughters, would be in Mexico. for the summer.

On 5/12/84, informants advised that during the time
MEX-18 was in CHARLES SMALL's store on 5/6/64, JEANETTE PEPPER
entered and told SMALL that "someone" was in town whom SMALL
should "do something about." SMALL said that he had already }
done it and was seeing that person at his hotel and arranging —
a dinner. . SMALL subsequently identified "that person" to
MEX-18 as LINUS PAULING (Bufile 100-353404), During the course
of the conversation between PEPPER and SMALL, however, PEPPER
said "that person" was not the one she had in mind but she
was thinking of a friend of "ERZIE."" Informant subsequently
identified "ERZIE" as the widow of JOHN SEKELEY, a writer -
who wrote the book, "Temptation," under the panname "JOHN . v
PEN" and lived in Cuernavaca until approximately seven years
ago when he left Mexico for East Germany. _ According to the

source, SEKELEY was reported to have died ex to have been
killed in East Germany approximately five years ago;

On 6/12/64, MEX-18 advised that on 6/12/34, informant
had visited the art gallery being opened by MAY BROOKS, at
which time DAVID. DRUCKER, FREDERICK VANDERBILT FIELD (Bufile
100-2278), MAY BROOKS, and RUTH CONDE (Bufile 100-434224),
as well as informant, were present. CHARLES SMALL dropped in

and made a very Zacetious remark that it looked like a
foreign branch meeting with the foreign agents and ‘underground
agents present. According to informant, SMALL meant DRUCKER
and FIELD were foreign agents and BROOKS, CONDE and informant
were underground agents. DRUCKER, however, did not consider
the remark humorous and left immediately.
