DL 134-4A-403A

Informant’s report further reflecte? that AUGUSTIN
ESTRADA remarked that he had spoken to two. perseng regarding .
WAUDE RUSSELL, and that. as a result, he had obtained $10.
Therefore, he said, the fee to have MYSS RUSSELL as a speaker
presented no problem. He added, that while they could raise the
funds, they (he especially) cowld not spongor MISS RUSSELL, —
The logical persormsto do. it wre JOE LAWRENCE and his wife.
ESTRADA and LOWERY had also suggested NATALIE. ROSS. as sponsor-

ing MISS RUSSELL. ‘The ROSSES, they remembered, have been. having

family trouble and she nas a selling job that keeps her away
from home. BILL allegedly said that if the LAWRENCES could

not do it, he would awk NATALIZ if she could spare her house
(for the meeting), even if she cowld mot attend. . BILL LOWERY
gave instructions to AUGUSTIN on how to comtact JOE LAWRENCE.
First, BILL wowld talk to LAWRENCE, after that AUGUSTIN would
call LAWRENCE at his place of business. LAWRENCE would at that
time tell AUGUSTIN he would meet him at “No. 1 in 15 minutes.”
That meant that AUGUSTIN showld call JOE LAWRENCE at. "Ne. 1.”
"No. 1" meant a public telephone number. BILL. LOWERY supplied .
that number to AUGUSTIN, BILL LOWERY asked ESTRADA that if
MISS RUSSELL was sponsored by. NATALIE or LAWRENCE, would it

or would it not be a CP affair. He said he had to know because
they (WATALIE and LAWRENCE) had, im the past, asked him that -
about other affairs. ESTRADA’s reply was that it would not be
a Party affair. : ‘ ; .

. AUGUSTIN, who seemed to have been drinking, got into
.a lengthy, senseless discussion with BILL LOWERY about fallout

and the outlawing of the CP. ESTRADA contended that while the
Supreme Court’s decision to outlaw tke Party was a severe blow
to the Party, the Party would go om. After ail, the CP's
headquarters have. been just a front for years. Besides, if
LOWERY was ever arrested. his friends in the American G.I...
Forum and in’ the Dads’ Club would help him.’ They would
identify. him as an homest, conscientious worker. These people
surely would consider the fact that their organizations could —
be next in being outlawed. He amd LOWERY recalled that the

Boy Scouts had been. called as'belonging to a communist. organi-
gation, According to informant, JOE LANDIN disagreed with then,
‘saying he doubted seriously if anybody in the mentioned
organizations would come to the aid of an arrested CP member.
They would, he added, most probably would isolate him or her.
