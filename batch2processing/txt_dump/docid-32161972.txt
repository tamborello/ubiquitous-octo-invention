ReBuairtel 5/26/64, with which was furnished a éopy
of a translation of a Mexican Government document furnished to
the Bureau by Mexico City airtel of 5/12/64.

ReBuairtel called attention to the. reference in the
translation to a list of reservations said to be in lieu of a
passengers' list of the Transportes Frontera Bus Line. This
reservation list mentioned in the translation is the @®ame as
the manifest of Transportes Frontera Line (Exhibit B1O6) on
which the name "OSWED" was manifested in seat Ko. 4. As has
been pointed out previously to the Bureau, officials of
Transportes Frontera indicate that this list ie utilized both

for reservations and for assistance in the accounting office
of the company.

Mexican Immigration Inspector JOBE MARIO DEL VALLE,
who assisted in the preparation of the document which was
translated, has advised that there is no list of passengers
related to the Transportes Frontera bus trip on 10/2-3/63
from Mexico City to Nuevo Laredo in addition to the reservation
list mentioned. Previous investigation by this office confirns
this statement of Inspector DEL VALLE. The so-called reservation
list mentioned in the Mexican Government report is the only

list or manifest of passengers prepared by the Transportes
Frontera Bus Line.

ReBuairtel mentioned the admonition against
disseminating the Mexican Government document, translation of
which was furnished with the airtel. Mexico City airtel of

5/26/64 swanehelia to the Bureau copies of the final official
report of the Mexican Government prepared in the Secretariat
of Foreign Relations and furnished te the Embassy here. This
airtel pointed out certain discrepancies which existed between
this final official report and the letter of 5/6/64 prepared
by Acting Secretary. of Gobernacion LUIS ECHEVERRIA, the
translation of. which letter was furnished with yeBuairtel of
5/26/64. The latter instructed the Legat to furnish his views
as: to the. course of. action to be taken concerning the
dissemination of the translation if the final official report
of the Mexican Government differed in substance. from the
information contained (il letter for: which the translation

was prepared,

As was pointed out in Mexico City airtels of 5/12/64
and 5/26/64, neither the final offictal report of the Mexican
Government nor the ECHEVERRIA letter appeared to contain
information which had not been previously reported to. the .
Bureau. No apparent purpose would be served in’ furnishing the
President's Commission with a translation of the ECHEVERETIA
letter for use in making a comparison of ‘it with the final
official report of the Mexican Government, which was. forwarded

  
  

‘to the Commission through ‘the State Department by the Embassy

here. At the Same time to do so might result in the compromise
of MEX-192, who furnished a copy of the ECHEVERRIA Letter to
this office on a very confidential basis without the knowledge
of ECHEVERRIA. Unless the Bureau perceives some very strong.
reason for furnishing the Commission with. a tranelation of the
ECHEVERRIA letter, it. is recommended that this not be done:
