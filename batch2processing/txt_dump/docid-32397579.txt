scholarly jo. Were cx:
changed, but in* about 1955,
swith the onset of the Celtural
Revolution this fow was cut

journals in China was appar.
ently suspended ducing that
« Period of turniutt.

However, a trickle of pub-
“ Heations out of China has con-
tinued, Primarily to scientists
‘in countries other than the
United States. Thus there has
been a limited Mow of infor.

" eology and biochemistry.

have become rare. However, it
is reported that Dr. Pierre
Chouard, professoz of betany at]

+ The sudden opening of China
to visits by American journal-
ists a few weeks ago has raised
hopes for a breakdown of the

barriers against scientists. Last!
