MEMORANDM FOR: Fred C. Wickham, Jr.
DO Focal Point for JFK Board

FROM: J. Barry Harrelson
DCI/CSI/HRG-Senior Review Officer

SUBJECT: JMWAVE History -
ARRB Request CIA #7

1. We are now at a crossroads on a number of issues,
including ARRB staff requests to review Agency files and
other materials which were not within the JFK assassination
collection. A number of these issues have been pending for
over a year.

2. One such request deals with access to review a
number of CIA histories which might provide further insight
into the assassination or provide leads to information which
would do the same. A specific history which has been
identified as a priority is the JMWAVE history. It is our
understanding that the JMWAVE history consists of 32
chapters and that they may not be all together in one volume
(see attached). In terms of timing, we need to move quickly
on this to find this history and review it.

3. Thank you for your assistance on this. If you have
any questions, please call me (613-1825; 31825) or Gary

Breneman (613-1839; 31839). ;
