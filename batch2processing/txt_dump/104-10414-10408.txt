: be” The ‘preliminary investigative work on &.. a
. KUSODA case of priority. interest was conducted.
by SCANTLING. During this investigation it
was necessary for SCANTLING to travel to:
Aquascalientes, Guanajuato md Minatitlan to
obtain the information required by Headquarters.
. See the attachments to HMMT-1416, 20 May 1960,
for the’ results of the’ investigation. :

he In addition to his contributions “to the above objec
tives, SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support
requirements of the Station.. For example, SCANTLING |
‘handled several. of Raymond H. GERENDE's (ps) operations
while the latter was away from Mexico City during August
and September 1960. Also, SCANTLING has been managing
the LIJERSEY surveillance team since the departure of
Simon D. CLACKETT in August 1960. It is hoped that
SCANTLING can be relieved of this assignment as soon .
as the LITEMPO project is approved. SCANTLING has also
been used to spot and rent safe houses for various
Station operations, a. valuable operational support
services

5. As stated in the preceeding Request for Project
Renewal, al though SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives
can never be completely fulfilled, it is the Station's
opinion that SCANTLING has made important and valuable
contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically
‘and to other Station activities in generd. SCANTLING's.
. production, measured against monetary expenditures,

case officer time and other intangible factors, unques—
tionably justifies his continuation as m integral part
‘of Project LIEMPTY.

This information is particularly useful in keeping track of
LIMERICK personnel and assisting with the identification of
visitors to the installation, Also, LIMITED maintains a

| Summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a daily
basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the
presence or absence of an employee on any given day,
Finally, one other significant service is performed by this .
base, the radio dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance

‘team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity,
LIMITED's photographic coverage is. still concentrated on
visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK
installation. A recent example of the base's contributions to
Station efforts is the case oflJoseph Ralph MAURT) In this
case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit

the LIMERICK target on a certain day. The base was alerted .

to dispatch the radio~controlled surveillance team on any
person appearing to be an American, The results of this
assignment were indicated: in MEXI-6392 and several other
cables, LIMITED was‘also able to provide photographs, -
which when compared with photographs provided by Head-

- quarters, left no question as to(MAURI's) identity.

b, LILYRIC - This base's output of high-quality clandestine
' photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year,
- In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-14, prepares weekly
reports on LIMERICK employees and their wives, -LILYRIC
-also performs the assignment of noting and reporting the
- license plate numbers of all carg bringing visitors to the’
LIMERICK installation, _LILYRIC photographs also are con-
centrated.on visitors to the target, as opposed to employees, |

...2. "To collect operational information and: identity operational leads /
- pertaining to Station targeta of opportunity," The LIENTRAP operation, . cde
handled by.'GERENDE, is the major contributor to this objective, It -
'- has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform
_ pretext investigations in support of numerous Station activities, . The
: cases listed below are cited as examples: .

a, ‘In the case of Cesar GONZALEZ, Sanchez (see LA, 3, a, above)
LIENTRAP was. able.to procure photographs of GONZALEZ at his
Mexico City residence which, when compared to Headquarters
‘provided photographs, left no doubt that GONZALEZ was the.

“subject of interest to Headquarters. ;

b, ‘LIENTRAP confirmed the identity of Olga ¢ CASTILLO de Ledon,
a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK installation and an ardent.
supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext
Anvestigation of the residents of an apart ment building where . ;
‘CASTILLO was believed to live, . Later, LIENTRAP supported the
_ results of the’ investigation with excellent photographs of the
mo, subject, ot :

.3.. "To provide’ operational support to o Station operations, i,e., rent

hotel rooms and. apartments, and coriduct counter-surveillances, "

other Station operations and activities, GERENDE's. comprehensive
area knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine.to make

him an extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities,
