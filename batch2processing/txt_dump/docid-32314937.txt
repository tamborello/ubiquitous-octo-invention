Information has been secured from KC 737-C#
that in early June, 1962, subject engaged in a very bitter
and serious discussion with NICK CIVELLA at the Original
Toy & Jobbing Company. Subject's complaint to NICK
CIVELLA was based on the fact that he, CACIOPPO, believed
that over the years he has not received his fair share of
the income from the organized criminal element in KCMO.
CIVELLA indicated to him that he had received his fair
share and was still receiving it, but the only reason he
had no tangible assets in property, etc., was bécause he.
‘had lost his money gambling. CACIOPPO intimated that he
was considering selling his home and leaving the Kansas
City area. Investigation has established that subject was
at Reno, Nevada, at the Riverside Hotel from 6-13-62 to
6-15-62.

On 7213-62, Major JOHN. FLAVIN, KCMOPD, advised
that officers had checked out CHUCKY MORGAN recently in
the vicinity of subject's residence, and CHUCKY at that
time indicated he had been checking the house periodically
because subject was out of town on vacation in Buffalo,
New York.

On 7=-3+62, KC 315+C advised he had learned that
subject has beéh in Las Vegas for the past four days. In-
formant was unable to furnish any specific information
regarding this or the purpose of subject's trip to Las Vegas.

been in the Kansas City area since. June, 1962, and the above
represents the only information known as to his whereabouts
during this period. : :
