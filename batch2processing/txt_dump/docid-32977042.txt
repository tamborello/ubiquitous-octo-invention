Memorandum for Chief ~ “eer wf

At 10:45 a.m. today while speaking on the phone with
SAIC Shields, Providence, on the Jacques Marijcase, file
1-9-13154-S, he reported that the United States Attorney _
in Providence had informed him verbally that the FBI,
acting on instructions from Washin ton, had investigated
the matter of the young individual JNeal Patrick Coady,] who
had been mistaken for a Secret Service Agent and had been-
allowed through police lines and later rode the follow-up
car during the President's recent visit to Providence.

The matter was presented to the U. S. Attorney for possible
prosecution in violation of "Impersonation of a Secret
Service Agent." The U. S. Attorney declined prosecution.

The U. S. Attorney further stated he was relating
this information to Shields as a friend and did not want
anything in writing.
