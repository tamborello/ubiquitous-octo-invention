A group of names were mentioned to ABAY and the
following were "well-kyown" to him, according to ABAY:

not familiar to ABAY, but he said.
that he remembers individuals by their faces and would'be able
to identify them by use of photographs.

He stated he would like to see the individuals
arrested who are placing bombs in the NYC area since it is
ruining the reputation of the Anti-Castro groups in NYC,

It should be noted the the group of names mentioned
to ABAY are suspects in the bombings, although, ABAY was not
told this.

The subject appears to be in an excellent position
to supply information’re Anti-Castro activities in NYC due to
his position of Military Secretary of Brigade 2506 in NYC, and
his contacts at meetings with Anti-Castro personalities.
