SENSTUDY 75 ~e.

This memorandum provides for filing of
voluminous newspaper and wire service clippings relating to
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC).

Since inception of the SENSTUDY 75 Project, we have .
accumulated 9 thick folderscontaining newspaper and wire service
clippings plus some additional material such as magazine articles~ ‘
and other public source data. Material maintained in tickler ”
folders, Sub A file was never opened. Retained material is in
general, but not precise chronoligical order. With the end of
fhe SSC mandate and issuance of its final report, it is . sy
believed we should now provide for the final and permanent .
retention of this material. a

 

This matter was discussed by writer with Messrs.
WW, L. Bailey and L. t, Brady of the Records Management Division
on 6/29/76 and it was agreed that the most practice] manner of
handling would be to file this material as a bulky enclosure
behind file and that no indexing would be necessary. Further,
that the original of this memorandum be filed in the main
SENSTUDY 75 file, 62-116395, and a copy be filed in Sub A
to 62-116395 which should be opened as a repository of it alone.
The presence of a copy of instant memorandum in the Sub A will
gerve as a permanent flag advising where the material is actually
iled.

wakGiNAL FILED IN

ACTION: Upon approval, Records Management Division will handle
in accordante with procedures outlined above. The material is
currently maintained in Room 3859 and may be obtained there from
the writer.
