Informant stated that ALEX apparently is having
trouble with JOEY AIUPPA and CHARLES NICOLETTI. Both
these individuals wanted him to forget about Florida and
buy a condominium in Chicago and stay here permanently.
ALEX stated he has no intention of doing this nor does he
have any intention of.assuming greater responsibilities.
He stated he has a very comfortable home in Florida and
he tried to talk the informant into buying a condominium
in the same building where he is located in Florida.

Informant stated that ALEX was critical of
AIUPPA and stated that AIUPPA.and NICOLETTI now. are the top
two. men in the outfit. He stated apparently they have
divided the Chicago outfit into two factions, "Management"
and "The Blazers."

Informant understood that Management was under
the direct control of JOSEPH AIUPPA and DOMINIC DI BELLA.
The Blazers were defined as "hit men.!' Named among these
by the informant were NICOLETTI as the head man in this
department, followed by the two SPILOTRO brothers, FRANKIE
SCHWEIHS and ‘to some extent JOE LOMBARDO. “ot

Informant stated that ALEXcomplained that Mana-
ement was not satisfied with the "Loop operations." ‘They
apparently wanted more money from their contacts and con-
nections in the downtown area. They suggested that ALEX
take a more aétive part in the affairs of not only the
downtown Loop but the near north side operation which
until recently has been profitable.

received top consideration except that he is currently
