; 2, I contacted Rosie Ellen ROSENCRANTS (Mrs. Maynard Burton
ROSENCRANTS, D, B, 3. MAY 1888 this date, She is presently
living with her daughter, Floxnce May. DARRES (Nee ROSENCRANTS),
who appears to be about 60 ¥rs, of age. Both ladies could not
remember much about Michael*MORO's activities in the U.S.A.
but were sure that he had nd business attachments in this
province outside of the buying and selling of antiques on
one occasion, Irene MORO, met Micheal MORO when he was
selling antiques, and they were married around 1934, Noné
of the family knew very much about MORO at this time, but
they informed me that he was born. in--Italy, and had been
brought to the U.S, by his parents asa young boy, Neither
of the ladies knew that he had lived in Buffalo N.Y. After
the marriage, Micheal MORO came to Bear River ‘N.S, nearly
every summer, accompanied by his wife, and on occasions
his brothers Albert, and Harry MORO, While in Nova Scotia,
| they never travelled around, and usually spent about two months
here on vacation, Mr. and Mrs, MORO moved to Phoenix Arizona
shortly after their marriage and on the advise of his doctor
a doctor CUNNINGHAM, who was practising in Chicago about 1936
and is now believed deceased, While in Chicago, moro operated -
a barber shop, which his brother took over, after he left for ~
Phoenix, Albert,/MORO was still operating this shop up to 1945
but his present business is not known, His last residence
was in Berwin Illinois.

3, When MORO moved to Phoenix Arizona, he operated the
Roseveld Tavern, the Venice Cafe, and the Italian Gardens,
; He lived on Ocanto Drive, Phoenix, and was well known in. that

area, Florence May DARRES, visited with him for two winters,

| in 1938 and 1939 as she recalled, and also worked as a waitress

' in the Venice €afe, She stated that although none of these

, places had been\licensed, Italian wine was always served with

meals, Mrs, DARRES~could not recall many of MORO's associates,

but named =P GOLDBERG, who owned a jewelry store in Phoenix ,A f/¢-

- A lawyer by the name of "SARACA" also visited MORO on
occasions, and he also travelled to Detroit on several
occasions to see him, Mrs, DARRES stated that she could
not recall any business. dealings beside the places:of business
MORO had established, She stated that MORO was always
surrounded by friends whom she did not know: "In 1949
Mrs, MORO (Irene) came to Bear River. alone,
would. not permit Micheal MORO ‘to come back to this area: due
to a bronchial condition, Irene was subsequently murdered
by Myron Randolph SELIG over a dispute between them that does

not apper to hinge on anything to do with Micheal MORO or
his associates, . ‘

_4, After his wife's death, MORO re-married, but he kept this
marriage a secret where it concerned the ROSENCRANTS, and
it was. not until after his death on 10 APR 65 that Rosie
ROSENCRANTS received a letter from MORO's second wife,
A Christmas card dated 12 DEC 64 was receivéd by Mrs,
ROSENCRANTS from MORO, and it was post marked Pomona
California, The letter Mrs. ROSENCRANTS received from his
wife had the return address 550 Webster St. Ponona California
on it, Nothing has been heard. from Mrs, MORO since then,

 

 

5. Micheal MORO had three brothers, and one sister, They

are Albert MORO, last known address Berwin Illinois, Harry

MORO, Berwih Illinois, Tony MORO, whereabouts unknown, and

Annie (Mrs, Frank) CAPPERRELLI, who's husband worked in the City
Pe Hall, Chicago, about 15 Yrs ago, Albert and'Harry were both
barbers when they were known to Mrs, .DARRES. and Mrs, ROSENCRANTS ,

6. Insofar as this investigation relates mainly to John ROSELLI,
neither Mrs, DARRES, or Mrs, ROSENCRANTS recognized. the name or
|) any of the aliases, Neith -had ever seen ROSELLI, and they

did not recognize the p ographs whith I showed them, Through .
conversation with Mr. DARRES however it was learned that MORO
employed one Victo TEWART TEWARD) as a bouacer in his
establishments in Phoenix The latter, she stated appeared
to be a very close frien of

MORO, and that she was told
that he belonged to a police force in Phoenix, Mrs; DARRES stated

‘that she had no reason to question this xplanation, and it
does not appear to be information of any fgaisicance, .

  
   
  
  

7. As far as can be determined at this.time, MORO was not
. well known to either of the two ladies interviewed, They could
\. not .supply accurate dates, and in most casés attempted to guess ©
\ when certain incidents happened, These dates have been
Le reported but may not be accurate, I feel that if MORO was’
engaged in questionable transactions, his relatives were not

: aware of same, Photographs are. being returned herewith,
