1125 = 16th Street . This ise retyped letter from hand written
Washington, D. C. | . :

Dear Sir:

Mr. Wasilev Consul gave me order to transmit this information to U. S. Government,

"on August 9, 1963 in Sofia, Bulgaria. -Mre Wasilev, Consul of Embassy of U.S.S.R.,

gave me this infermation about Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald on August 14, 1963. Mrs.
Besera Asenova, girl friend of Ruseian Consul came to my room and repeated that
Mr. Lee Harvey Cswald is assassin. He will kill President Kennedy.

On August 15, 1963 in Sofia, Bulgaria, at the airport in embassy car, I told to
Mr. Blackshire, American Vice Consul, that Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald is aesissin.

He has a weapon or has ordered one. Mr. Blackshire said it seems like he will
kill someone. I said that Mr. Lee H. Oswald is preparing to kill President

of the United States, John F. Kennedy. Mr. Blackshire said where will it happen.

- 1 said they (right wing) will invite President, criticize him in the newspaper, _

then kill him. Mr. Blackshire told me he will give the telegram to Department
of State and he gave me the address where to report.

- At 9 asm. on August 19, 1963 in Washington, D. C., I went to see (Mr. Kippingan).

Director of Special Counselor Service Department of State at 1901 Pennsylvania
Avenues11th Floor. I told the Director that I have information about President
Kennedy. The Director said do not mention name of President Kennedy, only
respond to the questions. -The Director said tell us what will happen to Mr.

Lee Harvey Oswald then. I said Mr. Lee H. Oswald will be killed after kill
Kennedy. I said I will take the truth drug to tell the truth. Director tell

us who else get killed in this country. I said as I heard, that Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. will be killed. Who will kill Dr. King, Jr. Negro leader? —
I said a man who is in prison at this time. (Mr.- Jemes Earl Ray was in prison ;
at that time.) Director asked where assassination will happen. I said in Dallas,
Texas. Director said if someone gave this information here I would expel the
man. Director did call on F.BeI. agents after FeBol. use anesthesia gas to
freeze me to drub me to keep amnesia. .

I told Director Department of ‘State that Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald have a weapon.
Go see him. Director told me’you too can have weapon-=so what if Oswald got
‘weapone . . : :
