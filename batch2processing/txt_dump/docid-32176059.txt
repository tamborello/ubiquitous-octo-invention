Enclosed are the original and one copy of a

memorandum responding to your memorandum of March 24, 1978,
concerning Willem Oltmans and a "General" Donald A. Donald

 

For your additional information, a search of FBI |
Headquarters' (FBIHQ) files shows that Oltmans, a free-lance
Dutch journalist, is known to have associated with George
De Mohrenschildt and to have advised a news reporter that
De Mohrenschildt claimed to have been responsible for
Lee Harvey Oswald's actions. FBIHQ's files do not confirm this
assertion. A relative of De Mohrenschildt has advised the

* FBI that “lies" concocted by Oltmans are "horrible." \

FBIHQ's files further indicate that a Dimiter Adamo ft
Dimitroff, also known as Dimitris Danopoulos, Diko Dikoff,
Dimitrois A. Dimitrof, D. Dimitrion, Dimitros A. Dimitriou, cop meet
and Donald Donaldson, is known to the FBI. In response to a
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) inquiry, on October 28, 1977,
the Bureau advised the CIA that Dimitroff had once allegedly
claimed he was doing work for the ZBI but that we had no
record of such employment, that eneral Dico Dimitrov kk]
had attempted to contact [an Israeli jplomat yethat Donald
Donaldson, born February 10, 1931, Winnipeg, Canada, was
known to the Los Angeles Office of Immigration and‘ Naturalization
Service under its number A12594316, and that records of the
Denver, Colorado, FBI Office reflected that Donald Donaldson
was an alias of Dimitroff, who used that name in dealing with
at least one of his victims in a fraudulent scheme.
