Because the man was not

agents do, and was not other-

of which we would appreciate your supplying. us with the
following information:

1.. How did FBI Headquarters first become aware of
the allegation?

2. Was an investigation or inspection conducted?
If not, was any other action taken?

3. How was the decision made to conduct (or not to
conduct) an inspection or investigation, or to take
(or not to take) other action?

4. Which Division, or operating level (headquarters
or field), conducted the inspection or investigation?

5. How was the decision made as to which Division or
operating level was to conduct the inspection or
investigation?

6. Was the original allegation reported to.the Attorney
General or any other Department of Justice official?
