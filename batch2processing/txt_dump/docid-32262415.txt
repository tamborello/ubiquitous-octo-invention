his place of employment and disconnected
it.

He was severely punished by several
young Soviet workers and denounced as
a hooligan.

The Soviets would not grant exit visas
or permission to visit Moscow during
this period.

February 28, 1964 A correspondent for THE NEW YORK TIMES
was visiting Odessa. Mollie Block
approached this Henry Tanner and gave
him an account of their difficulties.

April 1964 An article about the Soviet treatment
of the Blocks appeared in THE NEW YORK
TIMES.

The Soviets began harassing the Blocks.

June 10, 1964 The Blocks were expelled from the U.S.S.R.
on the charge that Morris Block was
guilty of acts of hooliganism and Mollie
Block was guilty of handing out anti-
Soviet propaganda to foreign students at
the Polytechnic Institute.

Mollie and Morris Block had been members of the Communist
Party in the United States for a number of years before their
defection. However, they had no contact with the Soviets prior
to their defection.

The Blocks had no knowing contact with the KGB. Mollie
Block believed they would be of interest to the KGB, but was
not aware ofeny such interest. Their only contact with |
Soviet officials was with Vladimir Vasilev and his replacement
when occupied elsewhere. The name of the replacement is unknown
but he is described as a blond man, 30 years of age, five feet
six inches, 170-180 pounds, stocky build. Subsequently, he
was sent to the Crimea resort area to recover from an illness.
Vladimir Vasilev's questions cannot be remembered with the ex-
ception of how to obtain an illegal U. S. passport, or one in
false identity (which Morris Block had done).
