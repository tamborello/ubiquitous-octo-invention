PHILADELPHIA DIVISION
AR - CONSPIRACY

ReBulet 12/11/64.

As the Bureau is aware, the Philadelphia Division
has been keenly alert in an attempt to penetrate the activi-
ties of La Cosa Nostra by obtaining technical coverage at
902 South 8th Street, Philadelphia, Pa.

At this address there is located a barber shop on
the first floor, operated by ALFONSE MAIORIELLO. Immediate-
ly behind the barber shop is located a room which MAIORIELLO
uses as a kitchen. MAIORIELLO, his wife and daughter reside
on the second floor of this row house type building.

. Our investigation of the Philadelphia Family of
La Cosa Nostra reflects that ANGELO BRUNO and the various
leaders of the Philadelphia Family of La Cosa Nostra con-
.Stantly use this barber shop and rear room as a meeting
Place.

  

Hardly a day goes by that BRUNO does not preside /
in the rear room of this barber shop. At this location he nF eG
meets with his capodecinas, various La Cosa Nostra members ;7\ |,
and this also serves as.a meeting spot with other individuals
in both his legitimate and illegitimate enterprises, 3

Due to the nature and type of neighborhood in-
volved (the barber shop is located in the heart of the
Sicilian section of the Italian neighborhood in South
Philadelphia), the Philadelphia Division has been unable “
to gain secure access to this target location. In the past

consideration was given to obtaining the premises of either
side of the barber shop, which have a common wall with the
barber shop; however, this approach was not successful.

Entry into 902 South 8th Street cannot be made
with complete security.

 

It is felt, however, by the following described
manner, that misur coverage at this location is feasible at
this time: ; .

The Philadelphia Division, after evaluating all
the available facts and circumstances concerning this matter,
desires to give very serious consideration to an REMT in-
stallation with respect to this target. .

Approximately 300 ft. from this target location
there is located a Roman Catholic convent, grammar school, i
. church and rectory. ‘This Division enjoys excellent rela- .
tionships with the Archbishop of Philadelphia and if authority ‘
is granted, contact would be had with him rather than with
‘the individual ‘Pastor or Mother at the above-described loca-
tions. :

 

If approved, the Philadelphia Division, complying
with required Bureau specifications concerning the installa-
tion of an RFMT unit would make the necessary survey so as
to locate the RFMT unit in a locked, secure location within
the building occupied by the Roman Catholic nuns teaching
at the adjacent grammar school. This unit would be secured
in a cabinet and locked and by prior arrangement, no one
would have access to. this cabinet. Modifications would be
made for the RFMT unit to serve as a "misur" and not as a
"tisur" and the coverage would be relayed from the RFMT unit
to the central monitoring plant in the Philadelphia Office,
eliminating the need for Special Agents to enter this location
on a regular basis.

If authority is obtained the RFMT unit would be well
within the 1,000 wire feet from the target instrument.

to development of a source at 902 South 8th Street has
developed that ALFONSE MAIORIELLO's telephone in the
rear room of the first floor of 902 South 8th Street is
a 300 series which is needed for a successful REMT in-
stallation.

The Philadelphia Division enjoys excellent re-
lations with the telephone company. AS previously ex-
plained, there are two "multiples" of the telephone of
ALFONSE MAIORIELLO, one such multiple being in a box at
904 South 8th Street immediately next door to the target
area. The second multiple is at 801 Washington Avenue,
appreximately two blocks from the target area. It is
felt that the Philadelphia Division could have the multiple
from 904 South 8th Street moved to the above-described
parochial institution and also have the multiple on Wash- voy
ington Avenue removed from the cable. Under these conditions
it is not felt it would be necessary to obtain cable prints

 

 

 

or block diagrams of cables in the target area. This will
not be done unless specifically requested to do so by the
Bureau.

Tt is pointed out that the request for survey on
the above-described situation is for the development of
intelligence information re La Cosa Nostra. It is not
felt that any information developed from this source would
jeopardize any future’ prosecution. There will be complete
security obtained and there will be no need to trespass if
the RFMT installation is authorized and ultimately installed.

It is requested that the Bureau grant authority
to pursue a survey and to determine: \

1. If a location can be obtained to install an
RFMT unit in the parochial institution mentioned by contact
with the Archbishop.

 

2. Irstruct Philadelphia as to what additional
data would be required of a technical nature to enable the
Laboratory to determine if an RFMT unit can be utilized in
the situation as explained in this communique.
