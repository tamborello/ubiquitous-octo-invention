ADMINISTRATIVE

On December 11, 1962, JAMES MILES JACKSON, Owner, MILES

JACKSON DRILLING COMPANY, Midland National Bank Building,
Billings, Montana, who requested that his identity be protected
with regard to this information, advised SA LAWRENCE D, TALBOT

- that he has received the impression that an officer in the

GREENVILLE AVENUE STATE BANK, Dallas, Texas, possibly a Vice~

‘ President, was handling the account for MEADOWS on a personal
pasis and might possibly be involved in the operations of
MEADOWS, JACKSON said this was just an assumption on his
part, but it was odd that he was told to make out ‘the $5,000.00

; bank draft to the above Bank. As he recalled, this Bank offi-

' cial was the person who told him how to make out the draft.

He said this draft was delivered to this Bank by J. B. DRISCOLL,

Arlington, Texas. JACKSON is of the opinion that DRISCOLL is

a legitimate businessman and has no connection with the gamb~-

ling operations of MEADOWS, JACKSON does not know the name

of the above Bank official but he said DRISCOLL might know

this person. DRISCOLL did know this money was in payment of

a gambling debt. ;

The information received from the records of the
MIDLAND NATIONAL BANK, Billings, Montana, on December 11, 1962,
was furnished by Mr. M. A. BARRY, Assistant Cashier, to SA
LAWRENCE D, TALBOT.

It is to be noted that the MILES JACKSON DRILLING
COMPANY also maintains an office at Duncan, Oklahoma.
