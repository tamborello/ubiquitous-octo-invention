A MESSAGE OF GREETING

 

To THE INTERNATIONAL MEETING OF WRITERS . .
BERLIN AND WEIMAR, 1965 " oY

It seems to me that your gathering sterlin o te

NX

and Weimar is an occasion of major historical importance.

 

You commemorate the past, the defeat of Nazi tyranny. But
you spenk for the present and for the future, for the
continuity and immediacy of the struggle for peace and
freedom, Writers of the world have a unique responsibility--
to their consciences, to their people, and to all peoples.
The creative conscience cannot rest or retreat, Theré are ce

today writers and artists who hold that culture is subjec—

 

tive and related only to the inner life of the mind or

spirit! But there is no hiding place in the soul; the man . -

 

or woman ‘who tries: to hide from the world makes the heart

 

a prison,

May thie meeting affirm the deathless spirit,
the creative spirit that honors life and unites the writer ;
with all humanity in creating a world of peace and plenty [im .

and brotherhood.
