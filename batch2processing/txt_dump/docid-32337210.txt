SJ 105-4195

On November 10, 1960 SJ T-1, an individual who
claims wide acquaintance among Dominican aliens and political
exiles in Puerto Rico, advised he recently learned about the
presence in Puerto Rico of captioned subject, who is believed
by anti-TRUJILLO Dominicans to be engaged in activities on
behalf of the TRUJILLO Government. SJ T-1 stated this suspicion
is based upon information indicating that subject was previously
working for the Dominican Government.

 

The December 10, 1960 edition of "The San Juan Star",
an English language newspaper published in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, contained an article entitled, "Priest in Dominican
Republic-Cuban Plot Here." This article indicates that Father
RICARDO VELASCO was a self-described intermediary in a 1959
TRUJILLO plot to topple FIDEL CASTRO, who acted between the
Dominicans and American-born Major WILLIAM MORGAN in Cuba.
This article quotes VELASCO as stating he flew to Cuba on

with tipping him off that the scheme had been betrayed.
VELASCO also indicated he later became a chaplain in the
Dominican Foreign Legion, which he described as a band of
mercenaries who were given the task in the Dominican Republic
of eliminating an invasion force that had landed at Constanza
in the summer of 1959.

Republic in August, 1959, at which time JOHN ABBES GARCIA, Chief
of the Dominican "Servicio de Inteligencia Militar" (Military .
Intelligence Service) (SIM), had negotiated a deal with WILLIAM
MORGAN, the former American paratrooper who fought for the «
forces of FIDEL CASTRO in Cuba against. FULGENCIO BATISTA,
former President of Cuba. ABBES GARCIA was at that, time
preparing a flight into Cuba with a plane-load of ten Cubans
to join forces with MORGAN in a plot against CASTRO. Father
VELAZCO was apparently supposed to accompany the flight, but
did not do so inasmuch as he was apparently too drunk to make

e trip.

In about September, 1959 SJ T-2 received information
from CARLO; ACEL, a SIM Agent, that Father VELAZCO was the
