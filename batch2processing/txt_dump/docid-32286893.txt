5. To determine the scope of interstate "lay off"
' activity on the part of known large scale bookmakers.

6. To cover activities, contacts and travel of
known professional gamblers and bookmakers, looking forward
to successful prosecution under the recently enacted Inter-~
state Transportation in Aid of Racketeering Statute.

7. To develop violations of Federal law on corrupt
public officials, who are allegedly receiving funds from local
bookmakers and bolita kingpins. These violations, if any,
will probably relate to income tax matters.

The cases involving PATRICK FRANK SETTEMBRINO and
CAUDELL WIRE SERVICE will be closely followed to see that no
delinquencies occur and our objectives are achieved. —

The investigative report captioned "CRIMINAL IN-
FLUENCE IN HOTEL EMPLOYEES, LOCAL 255; AR'' was submitted
_ January 25, 1962. This matter and related matters involving
“criminal influence" in labor organizations will be vigorously
pursued and closely followed by me.

In an effort to increase our coverage under the Top |
Echelon Criminal Intelligence Program, we have under considera-
tion for development HYMAN MARTIN, ANTHONY RANDAZZO, JOHN KING,
THOMAS ALTAMURA and PHILLIP SIDANO. A highly confidential and
productive source is being utilized on HYMIE MARTIN. AL MONES
was recently interviewed under this program, found uncooperative
and replaced by SIDANO. I have instructed there be a more
rapid turnover of individuals under consideration in this pro-
gram with a maximum number of interviews conducted.
