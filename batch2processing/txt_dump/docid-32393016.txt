Question #3 -, Did Mc€one or Raborn have any information on this:
‘What?

‘Answer: _

Office of Security records contain only limited information
in regard to this question. The SE Division (then SR) was the
responsible office for the confinement of Nosenko until late
October 1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the
Office of Security by the DCI. It is presumed that the DCI was
at least generally aware of the confinement of Nosenko and the
conditions of confinement, but any definite statement must be
based on SE records.

Answer:

Nosenko is currently employed at his personally owned
residence in North Carolina. He is engaged in research and
analytical work based on his previous knowledge of the KGB
and. other Soviet matters. He is in the Washington, D. C. area

primarily to compensate for cost of living increases. In late
19%, Nosenko was compensated by mutual agreement for salary

not received during the 1 April 1964 to 1 March 1969. In addition,
on 12 July 1973 Nosenko signed an acknowledgement and release
