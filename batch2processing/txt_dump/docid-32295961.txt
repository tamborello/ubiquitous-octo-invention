fhe Los Angeles Division in its efforts to penetrate |
into the Italian underworld has, since the submission of the. last
report, developed a live source, LA 4412-C-TE, who has now
maneuvered himself into a position where he is in daily contact
with SALVATORE LOUIS PISCOPO. As aresult of this activity, the 7
Los Angeles Division has now been able to ascertain that ‘PISCOPO, ~
who is: intimately associated with NICK GUST SIMPONIS, a Greek
gambler inthe Los Angeles area, evidently is a member,of a a
New York.family though he himself has been’ in the Los Angeles area t
for a period of some~-20 years having been broug here by JOHNNY. . i
ROSSELLI to participate with ROSSELLI and WILLI { IOFF in the @ fi. tf
old theatrical union wherein ROSSELLI and BIOFF/wére convicted ~~
for shaking don the movie industry. / D J2 '

, On 11/30/62, PISCOPO departed the-tos Angeles area
Supposedly at the request of his boss in New York and this infor-
mant mentioned above was able to determine from PISCOPO that in
his New York trip the family which PISCOPO was a member of had a
new boss who waS young and who had succeeded an\d¢ld and sick man, 7
The association of PISCOPO with MICHAEL ANTHO IZZI-in the (.Awv Ir’
Los Angeles area and RIZZI's contacts with the GASLOS at New ——————
York_and PISCOPO's statements of recent times that has received
orders not to have anything further to do with RIZZI would tend
to indicate that PISCOPO probably is a member of the PROFACI
group and he is possibly referring to SALVATO PROFACI when he
Speaks of a new boss. : ; &

  

 

The Los’ Angeles Division is presently effecting a~~”
. confidential source in connection with PISCOPO in its efforts to
further penetrate into the Italian underworld and the set up of
the various families.

There is no information available at this time that
would tend:to show any one individual as the head of a family in
this area such as has been reported by the New York Division in.
connection with their recent interviews of persons acinowledgeable ~
of tnese matters. The person best suited for this role seems!
