that MANUEL V. PORRAS RIVERA left Costa Rica.on 9/15/63 for
the United States. He returned to Costa Rica on 10 11/63. U
on 3/3/63, MANUEL VICENTE PORRAS RIVERA, was inter-
viewed and furnished the following information. a .
He advised his father owns the PORRAS Bakery in
Eseazu, Costa Rica, and said that he is in charge of the
bakery during the night shift. He advised that the Communist

situation in Cuba has worried him and said he decided he
would try to make a trip to Cuba in order to ascertain the

‘true conditions there to make this information available to

Anterested authorities. In furtherance of this idea, he left
San Jose in mid-September, 1963, for Miami, Florida. There

he contacted an anti-Castro Cuban and volunteered his services.
He was put in contact with several other individuals who .
advised that they did not believe he could be of any service
to them. Thereafter, he left Miami for Merida, Yucatan, Mexico,
where he contacted the Cuban Consul on several occasions and
tried to get a visa to visit Cuba. When the Cuban Consul in
Merida refused him a visa, he traveled to Mexico city and
registered at a small hotel located about three or four blocks
from the Palace of Fine Arts. On a Saturday, the exact date
of which he did not recall but which was apparently 9/28/63,
he called at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City but was stopped
by a guard or watchman outside the building and informed that
the Embassy was not open. He was told to return on the
following Monday. PORRAS RIVERA did not again try to contact
the Cuban Embassy. He said that several days later he left
Mexico City at about 8:00 or 9:00 P.M. by bus for Nuevo
Laredo. He recalled that shortly before arriving at Monterrey,
Nuevo Leon, he changed buses to Nuevo Laredo where he left
Mexico and entered the United States at Laredo, Texas. He

was unable to recall the time he arrived in the United States
but said the time was about 3:00. or 4:00 P.M. on the day
following his departure from Mexico City. At approximately
43:00 P.M. on the same date he boarded a bus at Laredo for
Dallas, Texas. This bus, he recalled, was of the Greyhound
Bus Line. He spent several days in Dallas and then traveled.
to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he remained for )fo or five
days and then returned to San Jose, Costa Rica. (a

He was shown a photograph of LEE HARVEY OSWALD but
stated he was almost certain he had not seen the individual
pictured therein either while he was trying to establish
contact with the Cuban Embassy, Mexico City, or encnoute to
the United states. In fact, he felt quite certain he had
never seen the individual pictured therein. ay
