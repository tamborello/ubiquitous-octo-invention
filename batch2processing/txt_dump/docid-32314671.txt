DE 925-Cryadvised on 6/13/63, that SYLVIA PARIS and CHARLES
“CHUCK O'BRIEN were discuseing FITZSIMONS, presumably
FRANK FITZSIMONS, and CHUCK made the comment, "They don’t
eave about Hoffa. They don’t care if Hoffa lives or dies."
PARIS commented that it was too bad what O'BRIEN did as :
ahe imagined that floored “him” (presumably HOFFA) as
O'BRIEN was “ali set up to have his job." She alse stated,
‘Whoever takes Jimmy Hoffa's place should fire them ail."

 

tn the past DE 919-Ce has indicated that O'BRIEN was im line
for the presidency of the Teamsters Union, Local 299, Detroit,
and that if he was convicted in the custems case presently
pending against him in Detroit, along with SAM FINAZZO and
TOM PARISI, O°BRIEN's chances at the presidency would be

yoid as the chargesict feleny and he could then no longer

J be @ union officer.

 

in view of the above, it appears that the comments of

DE 370-C, as set forth in the LUM enclosed with Detroit
airtel of 6/20/63, may velate only to HOFFA not being

a candidate for re-election to the presidency of Teamsters
Union Local 299, rather than to the presidency of the
iuternationals - ; ;

 

' Detroit recommends that, UACB, effortea be made to discreetly
iz clarify this matter during the next regular contact with

! DE 370-C and the LEM vesubmitted if more specific information
I is obtained, .
