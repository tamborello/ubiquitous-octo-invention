to OSWALD: a) in: “OSWALDS!s" contacts with Cuban and Soviet officials he made.
no effort to communicate in Spanish though he appeared to have difficulty ;
_ with both English and Russian, thus. one concludes that he could not speak -
_ Spanish. . All three calls about Odessa were in fluent Spanish. b) Marina
OSWALD in her letter to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. (reproduced in
the Warren Commission eeport) asked ‘Specifically to go to Lenningrad and
made no mention of Odessa.
