PH 623-C* and PH 614-C (TE) both are in almost
daily contact with-subject ANGELO. BRUNO, The Philadelphia
Division is opening a separate file under caption "CRIME
CONDITIONS, TRENTON, N.J." and anformation being provided
by these two. sources will.be reviewed for information of
interest re the crime conditions in the Trenton, N.J., area,

BEwfGoLos, of the Trenton,:N,J., area, is at
present operating Garden State Vending Company in Camden,
N.d. GOLOB, it should be noted, was formerly in the
cigarette vending machine business in Trenton, N.Jd., which
business was taken over by BRUNO's associates. The Garden
State Vending Company was formerly known as Windsor Vending
Company and was owned by WILLIBARIPKA, who was an associate
of FRANK "BLINKY' PALERMO... It was RIPKA's residence where
PALERMO!'s co-defendant, FRANKIE CARBO,. was arrested by the
New York Police Department involving boxing charges in New
York City.
. GOLOB, in the operation of the Garden State
Vending Company, is in frequent contact with PH 623-C*,
He has furnished numerous complaints,, according to the
informant, to BRUNO in regard to "SHORTY HAMILTON. It
is speculation, but it appears that. HAMILTON maybe the
author of the above-mentioned anonymous letter, This is
based on the fact that HAMILTON has been described as one
who "yells cop." GOLOB, in.operation in Camden, N.J., is

in competition with HAMILTON. He has told the informant

that HAMILTON has spread stories allegedly associating

- LOU CAMPBELL with the operation of Garden State and claiming

that Garden State Vending was racket-connected,

~ Information furnished periodically re HAMILTON
indicates that he apparently has an arrest record, possibly
owns a terminal building in Camden where buses from the
Philadelphia area pick up and discharge passengers, that
HAMILTON receives five per cent. of the gross from business
enterprises operated at this location, and is possibly in
his early 40s. It has-been sid that the "FBI" is ‘conducting
investigation re.the Garden State Vending. Company because
of stories spread by HAMILTON.’ BRUNO is shown on the payrol

ef the Garden State Vending Company according to PH 614-C (TE).
