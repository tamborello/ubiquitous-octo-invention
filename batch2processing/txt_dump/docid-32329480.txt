agree to the Superior Concrete retainer, which incidentally,
was never paid because First National could not produce a
bonafide lender for the Joyland Shopping Center commitment.

In January, 1964, Khattar's Realties engaged one
FRED J. POTVIN, Attorney and Counsellor, 418 Buhl Building,
Detroit, Michigan (Telephone No: Woodward 5-0544), to carry
out the actual purchase of the Joyland Shopping Center, and this
subject is familiar with the contract dealings between
Khattar's Realties, First National Mortgage Company, ROY BROWN,
LEO T, COLE and JOSEPH Y. STEIN. According to KHATTAR it was
POTVIN who endorsed the $5,000 cheque, on behalf of Khattar's
Realties, over to STEIN.

KHATTAR admitted that he suggested he be paid a
commission on the mortgage loan to be made to Khattar's
Realties by the First National Mortgage Company and stated
he told SITTSER that First National should pay him 50% of the
"mortgage interest fee" because of the amount of money involved
and the fact that Khattar's Realties was in the same type of
business as First National. KHATTAR advised he never expected ~: |
to have the firm in question agree to such a request. i + *
KHATTAR also mentioned that STEIN appeared to be at the
head of First National and therefore he attempted to deal
directly with this individual rather than dealing with
SITTSER who was somewhat reluntant to carry out Khattar's
Realties interests at the rate requested of him.

In. view of the above, KHATTAR advised that when the
sale of Joyland Shopping Center was to be finalized, he
went to First National to obtain the $1,275,000 commitment, oo
which was to be repaid in (19) years at 6% interest, and :
was told by LEONARD STALLMAN (also employed by First National)
that the firm did not have the commitment in question and
therefore could not give KHATTAR the money. This occurred
only a short. time after STALLMAN had spoken personally to
ROY BROWN and KHATTAR in the Chicago office of First National,
that. the firm had the required commitment in writing from
a responsible lender but he (STALLMAN) required a few days
to formalize the agreement and present it to KHATTAR and BROWN.

CG 87-22928

When these men requested to see the actual commitment,
STALLMAN said he could not show it for fear of disclosing the
source of the money, which appeared to be a logical explanation.

Since the above Khattar's Realties Counsel, FRED J.
POTVIN, instituted action to regain the $5,000 retainer from
First National, which was returned to the Khattar firm in
June, 1964, and presently another action regarding the payment
of legal fees, unnecessary expenses and damages, is in the
process of peing entered against First National by Khattar's
Realties.

KHATTAR was questioned regarding FELIX ALDERISIO,
but maintained he never met or had any dealings with this
individual.

In September, 1964, a foreign source abroad advised
Khattar's Realties, Limited, 463 Prince Street, Sydney,
t Nova Scotia, is a firm composed of three brothers, namely -
} JOSEPH J. KHATTAR (President), SIMON J.. KHATTAR and GEORGE .
KHATTAR. It is mainly involved in the real estate and mortgage
brokerage business. The mortgage brokerage end is the sole
concern of JOSEPH J. KHATTAR, who operates on the basis of
a "standby fee" plus a percentage (usually 3%) if he
locates a favorable mortgage loan for his clients.

During the summer of 1963 Khattar's Realties, Limited,
learned that the Joyland Shopping Center, Detroit, Michigan,

U.S.A., was up for sale and the firm (Khattar's Realties)

attempted to purchase same on its own behalf. KHATTAR :
(refering to JOSEPH JOHN KHATTAR) was contacted by ROY BROWN

and LEO COLE of Roy Brown and Associates, 20026 Greenfield,

Detroit, Michigan, who were handling the sale, and a price

of: $1,275,000 was agreed upon. In attempting to raise

this amount of money KHATTAR contacted one GERALD R. SITTSER

of H.A.S. Corporation (actual name of the firm could not

be determined), 100 B. Waters Building, Grand Rapids, Michigan,

who in turn advised KHATTAR that he had found the required:
financing with First National Mortgage Company. (KHATTAR

maintained he never personally met SITTSER, being in contact

with him only via telephone and mail). At this stage

Mr. JOSEPH Y. STEIN of First National Mortgage Company entered
the picture and requested a $5,000 retainer from KHATTAR on the

understanding that his firm would raise the $1,275,000 in sixty

days for the purchase of Joyland Shopping Center. The retainer
in form of a cheque was paid in escrow to ROY H. BROWN and

G. L. SITTSER rather than First National Mortgage. (This

action was taken on the instructions of SIMON J. KHATTAR, who

acts as the legal adviser for Khattar's Realties). During

the course of the sixty days period, STEIN made a trip to Sydney

where he met the directors of Superior Concrete Products,

Sydney, Nova Scotia (who employ SIMON J. KHATTAR as legal i

counsel), who were interested in locating a loan of

$250,000 for the firm. STEIN told the directors that he

probably | could locate this amount of money for Superior Concrete

but wanted a $7,500 retainer before any effort was made in

this regard. On behalf of Superior Concrete, SIMON J. KHATTAR
turned down STEIN's offer unless he. (STEIN) could produce a
legal registered commitment from a bonafide lender in the 7 8
U.S.A. that the money was available, only then would

Superior Concrete pay the $7,500 retainer. It should be noted
that SIMON J. KHATTAR was using the Joyland Shopping Center
mortgage as a lever against STEIN and the loan required by

Superior Concrete. However, the directors of Superior Concrete

were aware of this and agreed to the terms set by their

Counsel). It was at this meeting, which was also attended

by JOSEPH J. KHATTAR, that STEIN first mentioned his firm

already had a commitment for the Joyland Shopping Center and
therefore Superior Concrete should not object to the $7,500
retainer. SIMON J. KHATTAR refused STEIN's request, advising

he wished to see the commitment in writing before he would
