SUBJECT: Request of JFK Assassination Records
Review Board for Courtesy Visit with DCI

“1. Action Requested: Paragraph 4 below contains a
recommendation for your approval. The Chairman of the JFK
Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), John Tunheim, has
requested that you meet with him and the other four Board
members at Headquarters Building some time in the next several
months. He asks that the meeting be arranged to coincide with
one of their monthly sessions, which are held in Washington.
(The schedule of their meetings is attached.) The Board’s
Executive Director, David Marwell, would also participate.

2. Backgtound: Mr. Tunheim, recently appointed a
federal judge in Minnesota, would like to provide you with
a brief description of the Board‘s purpose and activities.
The Board has paid similar visits to the FBI, where they
met with Director Freeh, and to NSA and the Secret Service.
The ARRB members were appointed by President Clinton in 1993
as required by statute. Their principal responsibility is to
ensure public disclosure of government records xselated to the
-assasSination of President Kennedy. The statute grants the
Board full access to all documents that are related to either

the assassination or past investigations into the assassina- '
tion.

3. CIA has worked closely with the Board and its staff
from the beginning. The Board’s Executive Director and we have
worked out cooperative arrangements for resolving differences
of opinion as to what information can be released to the public
and what should be withheld because of sensitivities. We have
released approximately 227,000 pages of relevant Agency records

thus far, and are continuing to collaborate with the Board to

4. Recommendation: -‘That you agree to meet with the JFK

Assassination Records Review Board at a date to be determined.

Courtesy Visit of JFK Assassination
Records Review Board, 16 October 1996

We have succeeded thus far in working out cooperative arrange-
ments for resolving differences of opinion as to what information
can be released to the public and what should be withheld because
of sensitivities.

(U) The Board may also express interest in gaining access to

records that are not part of the JFK records (the sequestered
collection), but which the Board regards as possibly containing

useful background information or leads for further inquiry. We .
have released some 227,000 pages of relevant Agency records thus

far and are continuing to collaborate with the Board to identify
additional information that can be released.

(U) Suggested Talking Points: You may want to emphasize the
Agency's commitment to continuing the very positive relationship
with the Board, including making people and computer expertise
available to process relevant documents.

(S) You may want to assure the Board that CIA is determined
to give the Board and designated staff full access to all assas-
sination records, as required by the JFK statute. At the same time,
it would be helpful to stress that there are certain categories of
sensitive information that require continued protection and should
not. be released. Among the types of information contained in the
JFK records tHat we need to protect are: :

~ Identities of agents and CIA officers who retired under
cover.

- The Agency‘s relationships with liaison services, and
information received from foreign governments.

-- A specific example in this category is the'Agency’s
current request to the Board to protect
(elationship with] land to withhold
documents. received

 

 

 

 

 

- Need to protect non-official cover.
-~- The Board is planning at its 15-16 October meeting
to review documents that identify (companies Jthat
provided (commercial covey). We are arranging to have
the DO brief the Board on the potential damage to the
non-official cover program and involved if
such cover is compromised.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director

FROM: : John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: . Courtesy Visit of JFK Assassination
. Records Review Board, 16 October 1996 ~

REFERENCE: Memo for DCI fr C/HRG, dtd 13 June 96,
Same Subject

(U) This memorandum provides background information for a
meeting between you and the JFK Assassination Records Review Board
(ARRB), which is scheduled for 16 October 1996 in your office
between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. The meeting was requested by ARRB
Chairman, John Tunheim as a courtesy call.

(U) Background: Mr. Tunheim, recently appointed a federal
judge in Minnesota, asked that he and the other four Board members
have an opportunity to provide you with a brief description of the
Board’s purpose and activities. The Board‘s Executive Director,
David Marwell, and General Counsel, Jeremy Gunn will also parti-
cipate. The-.ARRB members were appointed by President Clinton in .
1993 as required by statute. Their principal responsibility is to
ensure public disclosure of all government records related to the
assassination of President Kennedy.

{FOUO) Topics the Board May Discuss: The Board probably
will discuss their concern about whetHer they will be able to
complete their work by the congressionally-imposed deadline of
October 1997. This concern relates to the very time-consuming
process that the ARRB and its 30-person staff is obliged to use
in reviewing all of the thousands of relevant documents that are
redacted, which for CIA comprise the bulk of our documents.

 

(FOUO) The Board may also seek your personal commitment to
continue the Agency's dedication of resources--people and
computer capability--to the review of JFK documents. CIA has
worked closely with the Board and its staff from the beginning.
