" Maraboto said members planned to rendezvous at an
undisclosed location on the countryside between Ponce and
Juana Diaz. ‘ .

"tre resembles “rural Cuba, he said.
" Names of the underground will remain anonymous."

According to the July 24, 1962, issue of the San
Juan Star, which carried an article concerning. the JURE, it
was indicated that Manolo Ray, former president of the Exile
Popular Revolutionary Movement P (PRM), a Cuban Exile Movement,
said in an interview that all "Popular" political factions
outside Cuba would be accommodated in a new Junta Revolucionaria
(JURE) in an effort to restore the splintered movement into
an effective working organization.

Ray added that the Movement would be financed almost
entirely by Cubans. He stated, "we can win with our own
resources if we have the will to do so," and "people who
don't believe that Cubans can win without United States aid
should not join us." Gi yu)

Jon September 4, 1962, SJ T-1,]a Cuban exile residing
in Puerto Rico, who is well acquainted in the Cuban colony
here, advised that the above article was a result of the
efforts of Manolo Ray, formerly a Cuban exile leader, who was
using the present crisis concerning Cuba being supplied with
Soviet arms in an attempt to regain the political prestige
he once held among the Cuban exiles. None of the Cuban exile
leaders are expected to attend this meeting as they have no
confidence in Manolo Ray or his ideas concerning Cuba.

(on September 4, 1962, SJ T-2, who is a leading Cuban
exile leader, residing in Puerto Rico, furnished essentially
the samé information as SJ T-1, and in addition, stated he
had been asked to attend the above-described meeting but had:
declined. He heard that possibly a few Cuban exiles planned
to attend this meeting but the 113 Cubans mentioned in the
article as the number expected to attend, was strictly a
propaganda statement by Manolo Ray and designed to add an
atmosphere of urgency and importance to the meeting. -SJ 1-2 JG
stated that Cuban exiles in Puerto Rico placed no_confidenc
in the statements made by Manolo Ray, especially concerning
his implied contacts in Washington, D. C., with officials of : —- /

[ss T-2 Cod cted complete failure of this planned
meeting, but stated he felt that Manolo Ray and his followers
would continue in their efforts to win the Cuban exiles by trickery
and false propaganda efforts. ‘.: i

(NP [Es T-3, a Cubay exile leader residing in Puerto Rico,
advised on May @, 1962, that Manolo Ray had practically ho
following in Puerto Rito or the United States and that the
Cuban exiles considered him to be, politically speaking, left
of center. He explained that although Manolo Ray is not a
communist, he advocated most of the ideas put in practice by
Fidel Castro of Cuba.
