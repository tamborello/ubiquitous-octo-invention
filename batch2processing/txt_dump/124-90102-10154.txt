4&. JESUS GONZALEZ CARTAS and
: HUMBERTO. RODRIGUEZ. DIAZ

: On January 2, 1963, JESUS GONZALEZ CARTAS
and- HUMBERTO RODRIGUEZ DIAZ, who have been regarded

as principal suspects in this case, voluntarily came to
the Miami Office, proclaimed their innocence, and offered
to take another polygraph interview examination. They
were. instructed to call back later that evening or

early the following morning for a specific appointment.
Special: Agents EDWIN L. SWEET and GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR.,
on ‘January 9, 1963, went to their apartment, 721 S. We.
5th Street, Apartment 3, Miami, at which time both stated
they had consulted an attorney and had been. advised not
to again take a polygraph interview examination. Never-
theless, they claimed they were innocent of the MIRO
CARDONA bombing incident.

 

On January 7, 1963, SERGIO. CASTRO GUERRA signed
a polygraph waiver and a consent to search his home, .
but it has not been deemed practical or necessary to proceed
with either of these courses of action, due to results of © |
interview with him.

 

On January 2, 1963, Special Agent GEE.
DAVIS, JR., met. with “United . {
States Army (Retired), who serves as Liaison Officer. |
between the CRC and’ some United States Govern agen jee
including CIA. Also present were [RoBERT MOORE Beputy
Chief, CIA, and FRED BUCCI, Security Section, CIA, Miami.

Will interview MANOLO RAY, head of the Cuban

‘Revolutionary Junta (JURE), whose iden ty is well known

to San Juan. (Colonel WENDELL JOHNSON Oo serves:

as Liaison man between Dr. JOSE’ MIRO CARDONA, President

of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), and: some
United States agencies, including CIAj/fhas advised that
MIRO CARDONA is opposed to RAY. Other information has ~~
been previously received reflecting that MIRO CARDONA has
described RAY as a Leftist, and that he would never permit
RAY to join the CRC. Some of these remarks have’ allegedly
been made through public media. Investigation by Miami -
in the case on JURE has disclosed that RAY was allegedly
in Miami some time prior to the bombing incident of
November 20, 1962.

RAY's representative in Miami, ROGELIO CISNEROS,
has been interviewed, but claimed to possess no pertinent
information. ;

San Juan should attempt to ascertain if RAY is
in any way implicated as a conspirator or otherwise, and
if deemed advisable, request the Bureau to authorize
giving him a polygraph interview.
