NOTE FOR: ) .

SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Files

 

Our goal is to meet the 22 August 1993 deadline for
completing the processing of the JFK Assassination records.
We have added personnel on evening and weekend shifts to
perform the indexing of documents, which is a major task
remaining to | be completed.

There are several outstanding issues that we plan-to
discuss with the JFK Review Board, once the President
appoints the members. We are advised that the appointments
will probably be announced by the end of July, but that it
is unlikely that the Board will be in full operation by
22 August. Among the issues to be discussed with the Board
are the relevancy of certain sensitive operational records;
the handling of MHCHAOS (US persons) files; and processing
of microfilm which includes duplicatory material.
