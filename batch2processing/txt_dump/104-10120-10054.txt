was Chief, FI/NA from May 1955 to December 1955, Estey was aware that
the wife of the Subject ws employed at the Argentine Embassy as of
May 1955, and was of the opinion that she had been so employed for a_
period of time prior to this. Estey, in his position, was aware that
the wife of the Subject was employed by the Argentine Enbassy and
recalls that the Subject advised Estey about this employment. It :
was his recollection that he saw a certain communication, or comuunica-
tions, which indicated that Headquarters had advised against the

. full exploitation of the employment of the wife of Subject at the

\0 Argentine Embaasy, [Tokyo, Japan| but that Headquarters had indicated
that a limited exploitation was permissible. Estey advised that
Mr. Carleton Swift would be more lmowledgeable of the above because

of his previous position and longer service in [Japan).
