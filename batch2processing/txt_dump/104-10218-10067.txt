in“Hexice, DOLGOV spoke to LEONOY about where to take Subject,
eaying that he wanted ‘to get in touch with "Rebet Sharke" .
(phonetic, no Station traces), who LEONOV said was in Veracruz,
Bubjoct and DOLGOY were in Veracruz fros 10 to 12 August 1966.
They also hoped to sea Goneral Heriberto JARA Coron2, an old friend
of the Soviets’, in Verecruz, Subject and DOLGOV hoped to visit
the Dosinican Republic but never reteived visas, The day before
Bubject's arrival, DOLGOY spoke to “Suarez” (probably Luis SUAREZ
Lopez of the Harzist magazine Siessre), who told DOLGOV that
Hareio HEJIA Ricart from the Dominican Republic was there with
him, and DOLGOV asked HEJIA to leave his address in the Dominican
Republic so that DOLGOY (and Subject) could visit him when they
went there, On 13 August 1966, apparently having given up on the
Dominican Republic, they tried to get plane tickets to Ciudad
