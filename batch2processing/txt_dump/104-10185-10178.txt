SOURCE: | ay “fornér Cuban’ IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelli gence
Service” “until April 1964. -

1. The Direccion General ‘de Inteligencia (General Directorate of
Intelligence ~ DGI) overseas field-station chief has no respon-
sibility for physical or other security of the Cuban Embassy or
Mission, nor does any member of his staff.

2. The DGI would not use a regular foreign-service officer, in the
field because he has not been cleared and briefed and is not,
therefore, ‘considered qualified for intelligence tasks. If a
foreign-service officer is briefed, it may be assumed that he
has been cleared and that he is thereafter considered a member
of the DGI (at least by the DGI). On returning to Havana per-
manéhtly, such a foreign-service officer briefed for a field
assignment normally would be sent to DGI Headquarters rather
than.to the Ministry of Foreign Relations.
