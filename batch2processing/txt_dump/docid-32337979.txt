. Dear Mr. Hoover: '

  

  

 

I want to thank you for your personal letter of 22 May 1961,

roviding information from a source who claims to have an official is
position in the Castro Regime in Cuba until recently and to have a :

[Personal association. with Raul ROA, Cuban Foreign Minister.}($) Cc
!

   

From, a counterintelligence point of view, I am most inter- a
ested in the allegation by this sourcefinat Raul ROA said that the - =
Soviet Intelligence Service had told him in late December 1960 that Ny
the United States planned to attack Cuba and change the Cuban Govern- X
ment prior to January 20, 1961 in order that President Eisenhower

would not have to leave this problem to President Kennedy. Of par- .
ticular concern is the report by this source that ROA said the Soviets ~

claimed this information came from a Soviet contact in the Central 9
Intelligence Agency. Ww .

Cine information reported by the source to have been received u é
Q¥rom ROA, who in turn is alleged to have received it from the Soviet Ye
Intelligence Service in December 1960, is inconsistent with the fact &

&

GAs of December 1960, no plan as described existed. ‘While this does:
) not challenge the credibility of the source as to what ‘ROA said, it
does raise questions both as to the existence of and the accuracy of
