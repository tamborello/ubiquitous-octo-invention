Travel Pattern of IS Agents

The IS has no capabilities for making false passports or in-
ternal decumeuts irom any country because of the cifficulty +
of matching the paper and the technical problems involved in \
the engraving and printing process. It also lacks capability
for erasicating entries in pasSports because of the problem
involved in attempting to delete entries without defacing the

documents. \
F, isification and forgery is limited to filling in valid blank

foreign passports, making photograph and page substitutions in
sona-fide forexgn passports, and placing false travel entries ©

‘in foreign passports. Travel entries from western Europe and

Latin America can“bé forged. Source did not know whether the
IS itself made the: photograph and page Substitutions and for-
geries. All documents requiring forgeries and substitutions
were turned over to éne “Alfonso,” in the IS, who took them to

a site unknown to Source, ‘Source theorized that the forgeries
and substitutions may have been done by the Departamento de

. Seguridad del Estado (Department of State Security - DSE), the

cuunteriatelligence arm cf the Cuban Government, which he said
has much more personnel than the DGI.

Prospective agents recruited by the iS'in other Latin American

countries and brought to Cuba for training in methods of sabo-

tage and other subversive activities are provided with detached
visas and spurious passports to conceal the fact that they ever
entered Cuba.

In order that no Cuban visa will appear in an agent trainée'’s
bona~-fide passport on his way to Cuba, the Cuban mission in a
Latin American country issues the Cuban visa on a separate
sheet of paper. In 1963 most agent trainees were being brought
into Cuba through Mexico, where the Cuban Embassy issued the
separate visas. Early in 1963 Mexican immigration officers
began using a rubber stamp bearing the notice "Salid para

Cuba” (Departed for Cuba), with the date on it, which they
automatically stamped in all passports of travelers proceeding
to Cuba. To counter this move the 1S began replacing, wherever
possible, the pages of the passports bearing this entry with
blank pages from valid passports from the same country as that
of the traveler. Source also believes that in 1964 the travel
pattern of a few prospective agents proceeding to Cuba way have
been modified, thus decreasing slightly the number entering
through Mexico.

To conceal the agent’s travel when leaving Cuba, he is provided
for the first leg cf the yourney with a Cuban ordinary passport
in alias, The route of travel is from Havana to Prague, Czech
authorities collect these passports upon landing in Prague,
Source does not xnow what disposition is made of the Cuban
passports by the Czechs, but he asserts that they are never
returned to the agent.

For the second leg of the journey, carrying the agent from
Prague via western Ecrcpe back to his native land, he is pro-
vided in Havana, before departure, with a passport from another
Latin American country. The non-Cuban passport may be the
agent's bona-fide doccnent which has been returned to him or

it may be another valic Latin American passport pressed into
service for the purpese. If the agent's own passport bears .
no evidence of travel into Cuba it will be used for this pur-
pose, being “brought uz to date” with forged western European
entries to explain the sap between the time when he left for
Cuba and when he arrived in Prague, but showing his mode of
travel to be such that he never passed threugh either Cuba or
Czechoslovakia. Should the agent's bona-fide passport bear

the Mexican cachet Showing that he proceeded to Cuba, the 1S

replaces the page bearing such entry with 2 blank page from a

»valid passport of the same country if feasible, If page subse
stitution is not possible, either because no other passport

.. from the same country is available or because substitution

22,

proves too difficult, the IS will provide the agent with
another passport,. from his own country if availabie, or from

another Latin Americana country, The substitute passport may

be a filled-in original, in which case a photograph substitu-
tion will be made, and the agent will travel under the identity
of the original bearer.

In other cases, where valid blank passports are used, the agent
may even travel under his trué identity after "surfacing" on
the second leg of the journey, in westerr Europe, provided the
passport used is from his own country. In such a case informa-
tion from his bona-fice passport will be copied directly in

the blank passport, If the passport is from a country differing
from that of the agent, his identity will be changed. As in
the case of travel undéer the agent's bona-fide passport, in

the case of Spurious ren-Cuban passports, faise travel entries
are made to account fer the agent's time speat in Cuba, placing
hin in western Europe, but not in Cuba nor Czechoslovakia,
during that period,

Quality and Availability of Spurious Documentation

23,

24,

Providing documentation for agent trainees is the responsibility
of the IS country desk officer handling trainees from the par-
ticular country. The country desk officers receive and main-
tain custody of passperts coming from the Communist Parties in
their areas of jurisdiction. Although the agent's training in
Cuba may take several weeks, or even a few months, it often
takes a year or more fer the ccuntry desk officer to be able
to provide his trainees with the proper documentation. Source
commented that invariatly a country desk officer will be short
one spurious passport in his “collection” of passports for a
group of about six trainees. ‘fhere possible the officer will
“borrow” a passport fren his cclleague from another country
desk.

On at least one occasions forged travel entries made in an
agent's passport were found to have a chronological error
Shortly before the acezt*s departure from Cub2. The error
consisted of a false exit cachet for a given port of encry
bearing a date precedits that furnished on-the false entry
cachet for the same port of entry, a physical impossibility
in true life. Despite the discovery of this | error the IS

numbers are generally in a five-drgit pattern, although. it
was neted that from June_ to Decexnber 1962 they ascended to

Six-digit numbers.

9. Source’s ordinary passport issued in alias was allegedly ob-
tained in January 1964, but was civen an issuance date of 23
August 1963 and bears a serial naxber consistent with the
accession pattern for the latter issuance date, Likewise,
five other Cuban ordinary passports issued in 1963 in alias
for us? by agents under Source’s supervision bear serial
numbers adheriag to the accession pattern corresponding to:
their particular dates of issue.

10. Grommets ‘recently ceased to be used on photographs in Cuban
ordinary passports. :

Bona-fide Visas, Vaccination Certificates, and Passages : -

11. Diplomatic visas for use in Cubaa diplomatic passports in alias
are applied for directty—by-the Cuban Foreign Ministry to the:
foreign mission concerned in Havana. In Source’s case appii-
cation was first‘ made in March 1964 for a Chilean visa ‘and
later for a, Mexican visa, even though no travel to Chile was
contemplated. The reason for this was awareness by Cuban
authorities of Mexican suspicion of Cuban diplomatic personnel.
The Cuban authorities believed the Mexican Embassy in Havana
would be less suspicious of a passport containing a visa from
another Latin American country.

12. Passage bookings and international vaccination certificates
for use by staff empioyees and agents using Cuban alias pass-
ports are also obtained, through the Cuban Fora@ign Ministry.
Vaccination certificates are obtained from the Instituto
Cubano de Amistad con los Pueblos (ICAP). IS persornnel's
passages are always booked on Cubana Airlines because such
fares are payable. in Cuban pesos. No passages are booked on
Soviet or Czech airlines because these require payment in
U.S. dollars, which are scarce for the Cuban Government.

13, After a Cuban diplomatic passport has been used for one round
trip, an exit permit from the Cuban Foreign Ministry, known
as “Visto Bueno," is required:-for each subsequent departure
from Cuba. The Foreign Ministry issues these to personnel
uSing alias passports in the same way as they would. for bona-
fide documents.

14, Foreign visas in ordinary passports issued in alias to IS
agents are applied fer directly by the agents to the foreign
missions concerned in Havana, .

Types of Foreign Passports Used by IS Agents

15. The Cuban IS makes use of valid passports from a number of
countries, including Mexico, all Central American countries,
Argentina, British Guiana, Colombia, Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, Haiti, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela, for document-
ing its agents. The IS hed no access to, nor need for, pass—
ports from Spain and the United States. Source specified
that the IS does not use Uruguayan passports because the
Cuban Government does not wish to endanger its good relations
with that country. Valid filled-in and blank passports from
