bd, “Between 5th and 15th July 1961 (onoe-ztts)
went to the Consular Section of the Soviet Embassy to see
‘about the visa. Apparently he did not see SERCFEV but met
AELADLE who showed a good deal of curiosity about him and
asked whether he had ever been to the U.S.3.R. before,
whether he had applied in London for a visa, what he was
doing in Helsinki cto, The posaibility of ABLADLE taking
English lessons from{WYNNE-ELLIS/ was mentioned and AELADLE -
paid he would get in’touch with (WYNNE-ELLI Spout this. He
asked for a short biogfphy off WYNNE-ELLIS)

biography to AELADLE two days later and although AELADLE was
apparently very busy he aeked WYNNE-ELLIS) for slarification

K MALKIN, who: had, been concerned in (WYNNE-ELLI 14 renxruitment
by the R.I.8 (WYNNE-ELLIS telephoned AELADLE to say that
he did not have the new address. AELADLE told him that if
he wanted it, he could have a visa 'tomorrow! to visit
‘Stalingrad (now Volgograd) and. in the ccurse of conversats
-gaid ‘sometimes it is better to visit places but not old
friends!, We wondered at the time, and ever more after
AELADLE's defection, whether thia remark had any special
eignifioance. | :

f. “A further develepment whict may be of interest
de that in early January 1952 (WYKXE-ELLIS) received a further
letter from his Kuesian pen friend giving him a fairly
pressing invitation to visit hime (MKNE-ELLIS) who was not —
aware of AELADLE'e defecticn, wrote to AELADLE telling him
that he had now receivea the invitation, and inviting his
to coffee at hie house!

         
  
 

   

    

: 2. "We thought that the arrival of this letter (it 6
wae dated 25.12.61) so shortly after AELADLE‘s defection, o
and after a long gap in the correspondence between WYNN E-ELLIS)
ore his pen friend, might indicate that the R.I.S. suspected

hat NE«ELLI d had a hand in AELADLE‘s defection,
of, (WYNKE-ELLIS) was never aware that AELADLE wae an R.I.S. officer,

             
   

eo of AB you know from an earlier conversation about
this 3s 2) WYNNE-ELLIS)is a most unsatisfactory character
to dew) with, and we believe that the R.I.S. have found his
. suppose that
Lal

but we would
not exclude this as a poss ty = or at ledet would not

exolude the possibility that he might have considered this.

&, “our questions on the(WYNNE-ELLIS) document supplied
by AELADLE are as follows;

       
       
        
      
   

a. “What ie the manuscript word at the top of the
first page, and what ia ite significance? .-

     

b. “Phe two typed words, one immediately below
the manuscript word on page 1 and the other to the left, are
not legibie on our copy,

        
      
       
      
     

o. “Zs there any significance in the date 11th
‘November being in inverted commas, thus "11"9

a. "We are puzzled by what at first sight appeared
to be a date, 22,XII.1961, in the heading immediate)v above
the text on page 1. In fact the Roman numerals 'Xiz + are
the cyrillie letter X77, but we do not underatand their
meaning, Can .AELADLE. explain this?

   

 

e. "What is the name in which the document is
signed, and does AELADLE know the true identity of this person?

        

f.a"we are a little surprised at the cyrillic trans-
Jiteration of WYNNE~ELLIS": name. We should have expected the
KGB to have a system which would enable them to get back to
the correct English spelling. Admittedly (annIE-ELL IS} 8 name
is an awkward one to deal with.

       
 
  
 
 
 
 
   

g. “We should have expected thet AELADEZ would hava
“pent a trace request to his Headquarters shortiy after the
first meeting with (IYNNE-ELLIS) in July 1961, Yet the reply
was apparently gent~only on llth November, Can AELADLE
comment on this? %

5. "We do not wish to suggest by these comments that
WG suspect that this dosument might be a forgery, but we
would be grateful for your confirmation that you do not
consider this a possibility,
