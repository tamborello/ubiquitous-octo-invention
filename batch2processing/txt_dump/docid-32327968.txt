The informant stated that among the many button men
in the United States are numbered men in the professions and
respectable occupations. He added that doctors and lawyers .
are included, naming an (FNU) LONGO, an attorney in Brooklyn,
New York, as an example. He also cited one of JUDY GARLAND's
husbands, VINCENE4MANELLI,’ a Hollywog@: producer, as a
button man who was"made™by JOSEPH-PRORACT. 1%
. : "\ fy a ey ele"

; It is to be noted that this informart“when“in California
knew the following to be important members of the organized
criminal element: a

4 : /
Serica in San Dies ¢
SEBASTIAN ANI bf LS
 JACKPRAGNAS@nG his son, JackS ABE Le
JIMMY'\BRANZONE (ph), now gécéased.

The informant again iterated that in the New York
area there are five "families", and that the head of each family
is a member of the "Commission". He. pointed out that throughout
the United States, there are approximately 30 members of the
"Commission", indicating that there are as many "families", each
headed’ by a boss, underboss ,and consuleri with caporegima and
button men, numbering approximately 10 to_each caporegima.

   
    
   

  
 

  

The informant advised that the boss of each family ;
is supposed to be chosen by the button men, and is known by them
as the "padrone" or "old man". His underboss is often called
"padronesuita".(ph). The, "consuleri" is usually semi-retired
and does not: usually have any button men directly under him, ;
but receives’ apiece of the action of many of the “family” ~ '
members, . i

This source also pointed out that the Chicago "family" al
conducts its internal organization in a slightly different .
manner, selecting a new boss about every four years The former
boss is promoted to semi-retirement,. deriving income from the
"family", He cited ROCCO FISCHETTI as being in this category
today. He explained that this is a truer form of organization,
allowing many more to make money than the New York system where a
boss, like PROFACI, can be in power and derive a lion's share
of the money for over 30 years. : .

He also pointed out that under the "old country" rules,
if a father was a button man, his son, during his father's ;
lifetime, could not be a button man, but could be in on everything «-~
in the "family". The purpose was to avoid a "blood line" which
would influence decisions to the detriment of those button men
» in the "family" not of the "blood line".

! The informant stated above that the button men are
: Supposed to select their own boss. He pointed out that more often
than not, the Commission will appoint a boss of their own choosing.
He did not cite an example of this. ;
In further explaining the function and authority of a
consuleri, the informant stated that in the absence of boss :
or underboss, the consuleri makes minor decisions. He is at !
all times an advisor to, the bosses, underboss, caporegima and
the button men.

The informant stated that the caporegima is often :
called a captain, but added that such terms as general colonel, ‘
etc., have no meaning or comparison with existing organization

‘in the criminal element. :

Concerning the expression "the geep", the informant :
advised that this is applied to a person of the old rule,
often called "mustaches", It is a term used, but not to the face {
of the person to whom referred.

The informant advised that the JOSEPH PROFACI family J
