Kansas City Office for behavior unbecoming agents of the FBI. He states the com-
plaint is based on their actions, statements, offers of money, threats, and :

“Office 8/69 to 12/69 ‘when closed for lack of production and upon determination that |
he could not furnish sufficient information to justify retention. .In 7/70 Horn was | |
suspected of having made threatening telephone calls to a Kansas City area resi-
dent. This matter was handled under the Extortion classification and prosecution -!
was declined by the United States Attorney since the origin of the calls could not {
be determined.

SAC advises it has been ascertained through reliable sources. that Horn ;
was involved in an automobile accident in the summer of 1970 wherein he’ sustain-~ |

dition and the fact that his allegations are obviously without foundation, SAC rec-
- ommends no further action. : .
