on page four, that he, the informant, could not “vouch”

for the information. The information was evaluated by. the

Dallas Office, and thereafter disseminated to the Bureau and

other BBI Offices in Texas, as a matter of cooperation, and

for intelligence purposes. The motive for DL-170-C furnishing

the information is believed to be that he is an informant, and

as such is furnishing all information received by him to the

FBI, which is as it should be, The accuracy or inaccuracy of the
information could not possibly be known by the Dallas Office, or

any other office, at this time--only the possibility of such’

could be: known. "It has always been the policy of the Dallas
Division, in connection with captioned program, to furnish the

Bureau and any offices having an interest, all criminal intelli-
gence information received, based on the premise that intelligence
type information is only of value when received, recorded and 4
disseminated expeditiously. sy
