NK 92-907

GERARDO CATENA, aka. JERRY CATENA, was in attendance
at the Apalachin, New York meeting of underworld figures
in November, 1957, and is reputed successor to the late ABNER
“LONGIE" ZWILLMAN, who was prominent in New Jersey during
prohibition and in the rackets thereafter.

On September 6, 1960, NK T-4 advised that he knew
“HAM't DOLASCO was operating extensively throughout Essex County,
New Jersey, and, in fact, was ‘the man" in the numbers game.
Informant added that RALPH CARBONE had been in his bar trying
to round up numbers business, but he was not certain if CARBONE
was operating for DOLASCO in this particular venture.

On September 29, 1960, NK T-3 advised that DOLASCO
had told him that he was paying $4,000 weekly for the Second
Precinct, Newark, New Jersey Police Department's protection of
his booking operations. He said $1,000 was for the day races;
$1,000 for the night action (trotters), and the remaining $2,000
to see that things ran smoothly, Informant stated he was present
when ANGELO SICA, one of DOLASCO's men, turned in $3,200 for
one day's take. : . .

Informant stated they were presently trying to devise
a tape recording machine setup which would operate like a —
te lephone-answering service for their bookmaking activities,
which would record everything by time so that they could not
get beat at or about post time. :

NK T-3 stated that they were planning on having the
machine controlled by a person several houses away from the
machine who would monitor the action and erase same fromithe
tape in case of a raid.

NK T-1 advised on September 21, 1960 that a butcher
named MILTON is heavily indebted to shylocks in the Newark,
New Jersey area, According to the informant, two of these
shylocks, JOEY SCHUTZ, ‘described by informant as a local
gambler, and shylock operator, and ANTHONY DOLASCO are
attempting to have pressure brought to bear on MILTON to
repay these loans. Informant continued that DOLASCO has
determined that MILTON's brother-in-law is reportedly a big man
in the numbers racket in New York and DOLASCO is attempting
through his contacts in New York with the STASSI brothers,

JOE and ANTHONY, to have pressure brought to bear on MILTON to
pay up.
