5 4 I think it should be pursued, Nartin Luther King was a

7 have these tapes, and I think that is the kind of. thing that
8 this Committee ought to he concerned about, and I wanted to
9 pursue it with Mr. Katzenbach last week but I thought maybe we
10 ought to go gently until we got all of the information we
li could and then come hack to the more difficult parts.
; 12 Senator Tower. iy view is I don't care to listen to a
: 13 , tape with derogatory information or material on Martin Luther
: 14 King, on his personal life or anything else, If it involved
45 some subversive activity or something like that it would be
16 a different story, but I think what we need to establish is
1 _ whether. or not this was illegally done and why and by whom, and
1s all this: sort of thing. That is what we want, not the tapés.

by the intriguing name "Tommy Traveler." I would like our
Counsel, Fritz Swarz, to tell us about’ that.

Mr. Swarz. This is an issue really under the agent
provocateur question. Mr. Tommy Traveler, who has another
name I don't know, was a student at a college in the Midwest
who set up a lot of campus trouble inthe late 1970's, It then
devebped that he was in fact an informer for the FBI.. This is
something which is not down there and came to our attention.

Chairman Church. Just added to my agenda, I am sorry.

Mr. Swarz. He was involved, allegedly invclved in campus
activities. It has since been determined that he was connected
with the FBI. There is a story of an initial denial, then an
ultimate admission. He is sonewhere in Pennsylvania now and
is a person we know will not tak to us withou a subpoena,
and the thought here would be, Senator Tower, this would be
a little pit of the footnote on the point vou made that we
would have in hand a subpoena, go to him and ask him if he
would talk with us, if he says.,no, as is the strong information|,
then someone would be able to give him a subpoena rather than

having to take the money and take two trips to Pennsylvania
and find hime .

Senator Hart Of Colorado. Nr. Chairman, is the suggestion)
of the start that that is an isolated phenomena or that Tommy
the Traveler represents ih effect a case study of a common
practice?

What does. that involve? i

Mr. Schwarz. It was the subject of a good deal of ques-

‘tioning of Mr. Katzenbach.on Wednesday.. It involves initially

a tap on his phone, then a hug, allegedly, in certain hotels -
and residences in which. he was staying. Then a bug at the
Atlantic City Democratic Convention in 1964, which may involve
problems of not only his conversations with people involved in
that convention but private conversations.

And finally, Senator, it involves the dissemination of the
material that was obtained, much of which dealt with his
personal life. And the allegation has been made that it was”
shown to reporters and other people. .

Those four areas. —

Senator Goldwater. _ Could I say something off the record? |

(Discussion off the record.) : :

Senator Morgan. I say this for the record.

First of all, let me say I agree with Senator Goldwater
with regard to the use of any derogatory information. But
from the testimony of Mr. Katzenbach earlier this week, I

Frankly was disturbed at the former Attorney General of the

United States admitting that he heard reports that the tapes |

“were possessed by the Federal Fureau of Investigation and were

being made for members of the press, and that he made an
inquiry as to whether or not they were being made available

to the press but he did not pursue it to find out why the FBI

Senator Tower. Do you plan first to ask them to come to’

testify under oath, then if they refuse only then subpoena

«

Chairman Church. That is correct.
Senator Tower. I think that is the best way.

Chairman Church. [I do, too. We will not use subpoenas

‘unless it becomes necessary, but I wanted the Committee to know

‘that we are now at that point and if it becomes necessary I

will issue subpoenas in connection with the Huston Plan.
In connection with the Post Office mail opening, here

again we have a situation where some of the Post Office

-employees, I understand, may have violated criminal. laws and

may be subject to possible prosecution. For that reason, in
order to get the facts concerning this case, it may be neces=

sary to use subpoenas to bring them in and testifv.

Stance. Would you care to --

In the Martin Luther King case, we have a similar circum-
. Mr. Schwarz Martin Luther Kind is an illustration of.
where a man who we have already interviewed, from whom we now
need sworn testiriony, has indicated that he would like to have
a subpoena to bring him in. That is going to be another
typical situation, .pecple who are willing to come but wovid-.
prefer so have a subpoena.

3 4 Chairman Church, The first item on the agenda today
A 2 relates to the question of subpoenas.
E 3 First of all, I would like ‘to call the Committee's
5 4 attention to Rule 5 dealing with subpoenas.
5 | ' “As much as for attendance of witnesses or the production
6 of memoranda and documents, records or any other material may
7 be issued by the Chairman or any other menber designated by
8 him after consulation with the Wice Chairman. It may be served
9 by any person designated by the Chairman or member."
10 At the first meeting of this Committee our records show,
i that we did discuss the subpoena question and I indicated then
; 12 that any time that it became necessary to consider the use of
ro i 13 subpoenas I would indicate generally to the Committee the rield
é 14 of inquiry for which the subpoenas might be required before i
15 issuing them, though the Rule gives me the authority to do so
16 after consultation with the Ranging Member. Now we have
"a9 reached that point where it may be necessary for subpoenas to
18 be issued in connection with the following investigations that
are now underway. : a : .
2 19 ; : . . ; :
3 20 First off the Huston Plan (where we will commence taking —

: 22 ing in chis connection. 1, believe the plan is to ‘start with
