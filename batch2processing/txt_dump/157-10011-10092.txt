MR. MARCHETTI: That wasn't what I meant by that.
What I meant was, it worked good under laboratory conditions

MR. ROETHE: You weren't referring to any use of thes

MR. MARCHETTI: No, I was not.
But that is that system that people are talking about
now, the laser people bugging system, where they can get a
building across the street there and direct a beam here and
pick it up. tt has become quite popular in recent years, at

least they talk about it.
