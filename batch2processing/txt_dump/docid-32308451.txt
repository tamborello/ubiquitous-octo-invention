Informant advised that HEMMING has a friend:

who is a ship surveyor, who was able to ascertain that

the "SS WILLIAMS" would be back to Miami, Florida on
about May 11, 1962. ® u)

The informant stated that CUESTA claims that
during the time he was working for CIA, ALBERTO FERNANDEZ
received a certain quantity of money from CIA, to be used
to buy food for the group operating a boat belonging to
FERNANDEZ. However, FERNANDEZ kept the money. (Hr u)

Inasmuch as this matter concerning the blowing
up of the "SS WILLIAMS" is not within the jurisdiction
of the Bureau, and LA BORDE and CUESTA have previously
been of operational interest to CIA, and there is apparent ly
ill feeling between LA BORDE, CUESTA and CIA, the Miami

Office anticipates no active investigation in this matter gue)

The Miami Office will follow this matter throug
feontact with MM 639- -Sjand liaison with CIA, and keep the

Bureau advised. £8) SFN(U)

; On April 30, 1962, MM 639-S advised that CUESTA
has three aqualungs, and planned to teach HEMMING and
COLLINS how to use this underwater diving equipment.
HEMMING, on April 27, 1962, talked to ALBERTO FERNANDEZ,
who said that LA BORDE was in Key West, and HEMMING should
discontinue his association with LA BORDE, because of his
being irresponsible. HEMMING said that he, COLLINS and
CUESTA were practicing with the aqualungs in the ocean at
Key Biscayne, Miami, Florida, on April 27, 1962, when
CUESTA said that they were being watched by a CIA agent
whom CUESTA had previously known. a u)
