on 5/9/61, PG. 612-¢ ‘advised SA THOMAS G. "FORSYTH, III as
follows:

The men operating the Mannarino- controlled horse: room at .
1195 Fifth Ave., New Kensington,. Pa., are being considerably
more careful in recent days than’ they have been heretofore.
_Now they will not allow strangers in the horse .room, and.
they will not take a telephone wager unless they know the
caller’ by name or voice.. ;

Gamblers in New Kensington predict a "lot of trouble" in
the forthcoming primary elections. The Mannarino group
favors re-nomination of incumbent Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK
and if the oposition group appears to have too good a

chance of defeating GARDLOCK they are expected to "pull .
off something big." Perhaps they will attempt to switch
voting machines. ©. ; : of
