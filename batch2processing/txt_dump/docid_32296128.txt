It is noted that it was set out in rerep that PCL JAMES
THORNTON McCLOWRY, MD, Springdale, Pa., advised that Father
NICOLAXFUSCO, Pastor of Mt, St.-Peters.Roman Catholic  ; A.
“Church,—New Kensington, _ Paes was close to the MANNARINOs,——~
and in late 1958, hid SAMUEL MANNARINO in the church's

apostulate hou: house when SAMUEL ‘L _MANNARINO..w was being “Sought
“for Servite of a _subpoena . mmmewanineme, wm »

On July 23, 1959, PCL McCLOWRY , ‘advised SA THOMAS Gs FORSYTH,
III, as follows: . |

 

 

 

On about July 13, 1959, Father FUSCO asked PCI if he would
give SAM MANNARINO a thorough physical examination. PCI
replied that if cancer were indicated, he could do nothing
for MANNARINO, at which point Father FUSCO indicated he knew
that MANNARINO was suffering from a malignancy. PCI feels
there are only two reasons why he should be approached to
examine MANNARINO; ‘ithe SAM MANNARINO is frightened and

r looking desperately for other, contrary medical opinion;
or MANNARINO intends to "use" PCI by having him subpoenaed
at a later date to testify that MANNARINO is too ill to appear
in any court proceeding. PCI wanted to know if there was any
reason the FBI would not want him to examine SAM MANNARINO,
and PCI was advised that any decision along this line was his
alone.

On September 15, 1959, PCI McCLOWRY advised that Father
FUSCO and his chauffeur departed on September 11, 1959, by
jet airline flight to Rome, Italy, purpose of visit unknown,
PCI stated that this trip was paid for in its entirety by
the MANNARINOs. PCI also advised that prior to Father
FUSCO's depature, Father FUSCO told PCI that it would not
be necessary for him to give a physical examination to
SAMUEL MANNARINO, inasmuch as MANNARINO has become more or
less resigned to the inevitability of his death from his
cancer,

and had requested the informant to accumulate a large pile
of American "stuff" for him. MEROLA also told the informant
at that time that he would have to postpone any purchase of

arms since the Miami area was swarming with FBI Agents looking
for stolen weapons. :

On August 10, 1959, the ATTD informant was interviewed by
Special Agents of the FBI in New York City. During this
interview, the informant confirmed the foregoing information
and positively identified a photograph of JOSEPH MEROLA,
although he could not identify a photograph of Pittsburgh
national top hoodlum SAM MANNARINO. .

2. MIKE GEORGE HAZIDAKIS

On September 21, 1959, PG T-2, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised as follows:

Although MIKE HAZIDAKIS is back in his native Greece, he still
receives a."cut" of the proceeds from the gambling casino on
Barnes Street, New Kensington, Pa., known:as Triangle Billiards.
When HAZIDAKIS was in Greece the time before this, JOHN VOZOS,
proprietor of a beer distributorship at the intersection of
Third Avenue and Ninth Street, New Kensington, received
HAZIDAKIS'! share of the casino's proceeds and turned it over

to him when he returned to the United States. The amount

was in the neighborhood of $5,000. VOZOS is not holding
HAZIDAKIS' share this time and PG T-2 does not know who is

holding it.

It is noted that it has been reported previously that MIKE
GEORGE HAZIDAKIS, a trusted cashier.at the Triangle Billiards
gambling casino in New Kensington, returned to Greece in the
early part of 1959. -

3. JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA

It is noted that it has been reported previously that JOHN
CHRISTOPHER FONTANA is the number one lieutenant in the
MANNARINO organization.

On October 6, 1959, PG T-2 advised that on September 30, 1959,
2 1959 cream colored Lincoln Sedan, bearing Illinois license
@8-55545, was in New Kensington, Pa., for approximately two
choyrs, commencing at 7:45 PM. He said that the driver, about

” It has been reported previously that a source stated that

as-of September 1, 1959, SAM MANNARINO was drinking to excess,
being drunk almost every day.

On December 11, 1959, PG T-1, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised that SAMUEL MANNARINO is
not drunk daily but is under the influence of narcotics
which he takes to minimize the pain he is suffering from
-his spreading abdominal malignancy. PG T-1 estimates that
this malignancy will result in SAM MANNARINO's death by
the Summer. of 1960. © a

\: Florida, formerly of Pittsburgh, Pa., is a MANNARINO
underling.

) on September 18, 1959, HANS G. MILTON, 845 Southwest Fourth
Hs Street, Miami, Florida, advised SA GEORGE E. DAVIS as follows:

 

 

In January, 1958, ENRIQUE CASADA, an exiled Cuban; opposed to
‘the administration of Cuban President FULGENCIO BATISTA, told
MILTON that he had an opportunity to obtain a poat. CASADA
\ explained that JOE.MEROLA, of Miami Beach, had.a Cuban girl
friend who could arrange for the purchase of this boat.
“CASADA took MILTON to the Garden of Allah Motel and Apartments,
Miami,Beach, where the boat "Menace" was docked. MILTON tested
the engines and told CASADA that they would have to be fixed,
after which CASADA told MILTON that he might use this boat
within a short time for an excursion into the Florida Keys.

|

\ CASADA then took MILTON to JOE MEROLA's apartment in the

\ Garden of Allah Motel. MEROLA told MILTON that he owned the
"menace." CASADA then told MILTON that some Cuban friends of
his and MEROLA's were tired, needed a change and wanted to

' the boat encountered more serious engine trouble. ‘The Cubans
went ashore in a dinghy to obtain aid. In the meantime, a
; storm came up and the boat began to leak, forcing MILTON to
: peach it on a sand bar. Later that night, Agents of. the
United States Customs Service, searched the “wenace" but found
no guns or other contraband. MILTON later learned that this
trip was actually intended to have been a military expedition
; to Cuba and that the Agents of the U.S. Customs Service had
| taken into custody three of the individuals who had been
passengers on the “Menace. MILTON later attempted to contact
1 JOE MEROLA but could not locate him..

 

1 The following information relating to the revolutionary

' activities of JOSEPH MEROLA was developed by the New York
Office as a result of contact with the Alcohol and Tobacco
Tax Division, New York City. LO

On August 5, 1959, RONALD MOSS, Special Investigator, Alcohol
and Tobacco Tax Division (ATID), New York City, advised that
Special Investigator RUDOLPH KALES conducted an investigation
| in September, 1958, concerning an attempt by JOSEPH MEROLA to
| purchase firearms from an ATTD informant in the vicinity of
New York. a :

| On September 26, 1958, the ATTD informant contacted Special
; Investigator KALES to report. that a representative of Cuban

 

meet with a leader of the Mafia named JOSEPH MEROLA. Several
days later, the informant met with MEROLA and two Cubans in
an apartment in the vicinity of 138th Street and Riverside
Drive, New York City. During the meeting, MEROLA pointed out
that he was associated with ALEMAN and that he was. interested
1 in purchasing large quantities of firearms, including machine
‘ guns. MEROLA told the informant that he had been responsible
for supplying over a million dollars worth of arms during the
Cuban revolution and that he and his associates anticipated

extensive gambling concessions in Cuba from the revolutionary
government.
On the basis of this information, the ATTD, New York City,
