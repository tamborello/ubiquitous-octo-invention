MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

FROM: Executive Director
SUBJECT: Declassification of JFK Assassination
Documents

1. The purpose of this memorandum is to ask that the
Directorate of Operations take steps to speed up the process
of reviewing the JFK assassination records.

2. As you know, all agencies are required by law to
review for declassification, and transfer to the National
Archives by 22 August 1993, all records relevant to the
assassination of President Kennedy. As of 1 April, the DO
faced a backlog of some 57,000 pages just to catch up with
what has been reviewed initially by the Historical Review
Group. There will be an additional 135,000 pages to process
by 22 August. Although I realize that resources are scarce,
I believe that there is no option but to increase the level
of effort on this task if we are to meet the deadline.

3. The declassification of the documents will be
speeded up if the pace of the coordination process is
improved. In addition to the resource aspects, I am
concerned that coordination is being prolonged unnecessarily
because of what may be at times an overly rigid approach to
protecting sources and methods. The JFK legislation permits
withholding of information on sources and methods only when
there is "clear and convincing evidence" that release would
"demonstrably impair" national security.

4. OGC advises that the JFK legislation supersedes all
other statutory authority for withholding information
(except portions of the Internal Revenue Code). At the same
time, the information released under the Act does not
establish a precedent for purposes of FOIA and other
matters. The assassination records constitute. an exception.
The Act allows us to protect genuinely sensitive information
such as names of agents, sources or methods currently in use
or expected to be used, and current foreign liaison
relationships.
