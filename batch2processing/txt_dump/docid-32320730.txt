Legat Paris has requesta outstanding with the (osm, DGSE, and
Prefecture of Police regarding all documents supplied by fax to

_ Legat Paria. Each agency has advised that decisions must be made
at high levels (for example, DGSE's Director must review the
matter, and he is currently out of town; the package for the
Prefecture of Police had to be conveyed in the form of a written
formal request and hand-delivered: to the ere eesy fe Office). We
note that the Sureté Nationale no longer exista,) kS)

rad
Legat Paris will follow this matter closely and report results as
received, However, FBIHQ should bear in mind that the problens
of old archivea documents, compounded with the need for .
translation, will cause certain inevitable delays.

. . We greatly appreciate the responsiveness of the task force in
/ helping remedy problems of poor quality or partially conveyed

documents.
