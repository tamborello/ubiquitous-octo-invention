ADMINISTRATIVE;

On 7/27/63, DL 185-C-TE advised that MATTHEWS was
presently in possession of $30,000 which he had obtained
for "planting somebody", meaning murder for money. Informant
had no further details concerning the above, but stated he
would endeavor to ascertain further information concerning

The above facts were discussed with Lt. JACK
REVILL, Criminal Intelligence Section,-Dallas PD, who
made discreet inquiry through sources in an effort to
verify above information, Lt. REVILL advised he was un-
successful in his efforts. :

Information previously received from REVILL
from a highly confidential source indicated that a JACK
GUNTER and HUBERT DANE HARRIS, gamblers from Hot Springs,
Ark., were in Dallas, Tex., on 5/30/63, and attempted
to contact MATTHEWS at his residence, . It was learned that
they were unsuccessful in their contact and MATTHEWS
had indicated to his daughter that he did not want to
see them at. the time.

According to REVILL's sources, GUNTER indicated
that it was-most urgent they talk with MATTHEWS.

. Re information set forth in report concerning
LEO Ji LEWIS, former SL 1137-C statd LEO LEWIS had made
bets in the past on horses and is, no doubt, the type
of individual a handbook operator would like to have
