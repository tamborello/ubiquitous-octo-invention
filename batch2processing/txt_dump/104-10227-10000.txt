COMMENTS

Ry memorandum dated 2 October 1968,

the Director of Security forwarded

two reports to the DUCE summarizing

the results of the NOSENKO case to

that date. The reports are voluminous.
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI. .
Both reports conclude that. NOSENKO

  

"was a bona fide defector. A draft

‘ memorandum attached to this file,

dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raisés question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides ©

and challenges the above two reports.

NOSENKO continues under contract to

the Agency. He is brought to Washington
periodically to consult on matters
germane to his background and experience.
Various reports are availible in the
files of the Office of Security which
detail financial aspects of this case.

No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files

‘do document the rationale for the original

ENKO, they do not

 

confinement of NOS

-document the rationale for his continued

confinement over so long a period of time.
A memorandum dated 5 August 1969 states
that various congressional staff officers
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted |
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document
a period in 1969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO

was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.
During this trip, Agency personnel, with
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained
the services of prostitutes. This
apparently occurred on at least two
occasions.
