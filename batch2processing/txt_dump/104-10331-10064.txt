MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director

THROUGH: Director, Center for the
Study of Intelligence

FROM: John F. Pereira
Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: Appointment of Directorate Focal Points
for JFK Assassination Board Requests =
; yh,

1. It is recommended that you request the Directorates
to appoint focal point officers for purposes of responding
to requests from the (President Kennedy) Assassination
Records Review Board.

2. Background

President Clinton appointed the Board to oversee the
release of records related to both the assassination of
President Kennedy and the investigations into the
assassination. The Board has forwarded to us the first
(attached) of what are likely to be many requests for
additional information from CIA records.

The Historical Review Group (HRG) has reviewed more
than 400,000 pages of JFK-related records, most of which
were contained in the “sequestered records” that were
collected for the House Assassination Committee's
investigation and in the Oswald 201 file. Up to now, no new
searches have been required. Now that the Board has begun to
generate requests for additional information, the Agency
needs to create a mechanism fo processing the requests and
for tasking components to conduct records searches.

It is probably advisable to have HRG continue to
serve as principal liaison with the Board. HRG could
continue to receive the Board's requests and to be .

- responsible for coordinating responses from CIA. (Another
option would be to assign someone elsewwhere to be the
principal liaison and restrict HRG's role to.that of
reviewing documents for declassification and assisting with
coordination.) :

. an
1. Addressees are requested to appoint a focal point -
officer for your directorate who would be responsible for

Kennedy) Assassination Records Review Board.

2. The Agency has received the first (attached) of what
are likely to be many requests from the Board for
information related to the assassination of President
Kennedy and to the investigations into.the assassination.

Up to now, the Board has focused on the “sequestered”
records that CIA had collected for the House Assassination
Committee's investigation and documents that had been part
of the Oswald 201 file. It is expected that the new requests
will require records searches to be. done for additional
information.

3. The Historical Review Group (HRG), which has been
the Agency's principal liaison with the JFK Board, will
continue in that role. HRG will receive requests from the
Board, and then forward them to the Directorate focal points
for action. Responses from the Directorates will be
coordinated by HRG, which will make the the responses
available.to the Board.
