Senator Baker. Could you, for the sake and the g

. cation of my longstanding concern in that respect, supply for

the record a further identification for that as Western
Hemisphere instead of White House?

Mr. Colby. I want to make sure that this is what this
says. This is a reply from the station. And it sounds to me
like in this case that he really means Western Hemisphere
Division.

“Senator Baker. Is there some way we can determins
vhether he is talking about White House or Western Hemisphere?

Mr. Colby. This supports my previous comment about the
level of approval and authorization. In other words, the
Chief of Station formally deals with his division. He thinks
of his division as his héadquarters, the chain of command for
him, with the realization that there are levels of approval
above the division which can get exemption to certain regula-
tions if it were appropriate. And from my reading of many

cables over the years, I can smell this one pretty clearly as

a communication between station and

 

jestern Hemisphere Division. We can check with
