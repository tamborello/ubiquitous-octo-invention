FORAN stated that MORRISSEY told him that one of
the attorneys in the Task Force at Chicago took the tape to
the Attorney General, "a week ago last Friday." MORRISSEY
told FORAN that there are only the original and two copies
of this tape. HANRAHAN has the original tape; MORRISSEY has
one copy, and the second copy was delivered to the Attorney
General.

According to FORAN, CAIN discussed payoffs he had
received during the time he was on the Chicago Police Department
and during the time he was the Chief Investigator for former
Sheriff OGILVIE, He reportedly admitted that he received a
payoff of $1,000 a month while Chief Investigator from organized
crime to permit organized crime to operate, FORAN stated that
CAIN talked generally about syndicate operations, but actually
furnished no new or specific information. He did mention that
he had performed some wiretapping and commented that he had
tapped the wire of Mayor RICHARD DALEY, and then mailed the
tapes anonymously to the Mayor.

FORAN stated that the tape was a general mish-mash
of past activity, and according to MORRISSEY was taken for
the purpose of permitting CAIN to demonstrate that he possesses
the background and knowledge to be an "excellent Government
under-cover Agent," should he be released from jail. FORAN
commented that HANRAHAN kept pressing for information concerning
OGILVIE, but CAIN furnished nothing specific.

FORAN speculated, in strictest confidence, that the
reason why the Department of Justice asked for FORAN’s resignation,
effective 7/1/69, as U.S. Attorney, ws that the Department feared
that HANRAHAN, Cook County State's Attorney, a Democrat, might
work with FORAN, a Democrat, to embarrass the Republican administra- |
tion. ba

Of further interest, it is to be noted that CG 7356-C
advised on 6/2/69, that information is now all over the Federal
tier at the Gdéok County Jail where RICHARD CAIN was incarcerated,
that CAIN had been offered a deal by Cook County State's Attorney
EDWARD V. HANRAHAN for his cooperation, Informant stated
that CAIN had allegedly been interviewed extensively by HANRAHAN
and reportedly had appeared before the Cook County Grand Jury.
Informant stated that the information he had received was
that CAIN had offered HANRAHAN information to the effect that f
all of the gambling raids conducted by CAIN while he was
Chief Investigator for the Cook County Sheriff's Office, under i
former Sheriff OGILVIE, had been conducted with the consent of
SAM GIANCANA, head of organized crime in Chicago.
