Although each request had unique characterigtics,
all began as a request by the Board or an ARRB staff méinber
on behalf of the board for information. The requests fell
generally into five broad categories as follows:

a. Requests for access to basic information which
would help the board understand the CIA, its organizational
structure and how it operated around the time of the

.assassination which included: Requests for organizational

charts, briefings, mission statements, etc.; review of over
_._. histories of CIA offices and projects; a review of the
so-called “Breckinridge files;* and, a search for an IG
index of Oswald reports.

b. Requests about methodologies which included: How
cable traffic was handled at HQ during the relevant time
period; the existence and use of the inter-agency source
registry; and, the assignment and use of alias’s pseudonyms,
erypts, etc.

c. Requests for subject specific matters which
included: The Mexico City Station annual reports; the
existence of DRE monthly reports; Oswald’s pre assassination
files; and, a search for any documents or information
detailing the Agency’s involvement in transporting and
processing the Zapruder film. “«

dad. Requests for project specific information and

‘files, which included: Requests for information and files on

AMWORLD, QKENCHANT, an index to the HTLINGUAL materials, and
the Mexico City electronic surveillance tapes. ;

e. Requests for individual specific information
and files, which included both CIA and CIA associated
individuals and non-CIA individuals: Information on
individuals with JMWORLD; detailed information on Sylvia
Duran; a determination of the identify of a particular
“George Bush;” and, the files on William Pawley.

3. How a Request was Worked Following receipt of a
request and HRP tasking the responsible Agency component (s)
to conduct a search, the materials found were first reviewed
by HRP staff members before access was provided to the ARRB
staff. ARRB staff then reviewed the documents and materials
and identified those which it believed were relevant to
their inquiry and these materials were placed in the normal
queue to be reviewed and processed for release. However,
the mere identification of materials did not equate to
automatic release. Rather, if particularly sensitive
information was involved, negotiations took place and, on
occasion, a written statement about the materials was
provided for release vice the actual document(s).

43. The Agency’s written responses to each request -

either a letter or memoranda - included, of course, the fact

the materials designated were to be processed for release
according to then current guidelines. The ARRB staff then
wrote its own version of the request, search, and response.
Both of these are a part of the public record on this
project. ,
Se. Lessons learned: A number of things syrfaced as
HRP worked to complete these requests which required
considerable explanation, negotiation, and resolution.

a. First among these was the fact there existed an
outside Board which asked for information and carefully
monitored the responses (a very powerful external Board with
subpoena authority), without doubt caused documents and
information to be found and made available that would not
have been provided to an internal declassification project.

b. Second, for any large project such as JFK to be
successful, there is an absolute requirement that each
directorate and independent office identify two responsible
persons -- a senior management official who-can ensure that
deadlines (particularly deadlines established by an external

DRAFT: Section 271, ARRB Requests for Additional
Information and Records

1. Unlike most declassification projects, the Agency’s
involvement in the JFK Project was governed by the dictates
of a Federal statute, the JFK Act, and the powers it vested
in the Board it established -- the Assassination Records
Review Board ({ARRB). In particular, under Section 7, the
Act armed the ARRB with the authority to dig for records and
information, specifically: ,

++- (1) The Review Board shall have the authority
to act in a manner prescribed under this Act, in-
cluding authority to --

* * *

(C) (ii) direct a Government office to make
available to the Review Board, and if necessary
investigate the facts surrounding, additional
information, records, or testimony from
individuals, which the Review Board has reason
to believe is required to fulfill its functions
and responsibilities;

* * *

(F) hold hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena

witnesses. and documents. ;
This substantial authority provided the“ARRB and its staff
with almost unlimited access to Agency records and
personnel. It also was the basis for a number of specific
requests from the Board to the Agency for additional
information, document searches and explanatory papers. HRP
designated this ARRB activity, “Special Requests.” During
its existence the ARRB sent to the Agency fifty-three
special. requests, CIA 1-16 and CIA-IR 1-37.

2. Categories of Requests:

4
13-00000

* We need to establish early on what information is
already in the public domain and address the issue of
“official release” in the context of each project.

* Develop a strategy/policy with the IROs concerning the
reléase of information. Be smart about it; do not accept
stonewalling by them on relevant information that can be
released. At the same time, avoid confrontations with them
on marginal or non-relevant information.

* | On-site Directorate reviewers are the most effective
way to handle the internal coordination requirements of a
large. project. Without the DO's JFK team on site it would
have been impossible to complete the JFK project.

* Develop guidelines and processes for coordinating Third
Agency documents; include other agencies in discussions; do
not drop documents into the black hole of other agencies'
FOIA offices without this advance discussion.

* Maintain written, up-to-date, project-specific
declassification guidelines. This is no small task. A
“declassification guide” must be flexible; no guide can
anticipate all the issues which will arise in a review.
After six years, we were still revising the JFK guidelines
in the last month of the project.

* In establishing deadlines, allow sufficient time to do

a thorough, professional job as required by the project

activities (see Unrealistic Deadlines above) .

* Ensure we have adequate support people for routine

processing tasks; declassification involves both tough

substantive analysis--and a lot of routine processing.

* If possible, inventory/index all materials before the

review and processing begins. Experienced indexers are a

must. Identification of duplicate documents should be a key

part of any inventory or index.

Attachment II. [being drafted-will be available 17 Dec a.m.]

[statistical summary of collection including size and status

* there were two major releases of Agency records (August
1993 and August 1994)of approximately 227,000 pages;

* joint HRG/DO teams reviewed additional assassination
related collections at National Archives (Warren
Commission), the SSCI (Church Committee and the Ford
Presidential Library (Rockefellow Commission) plus
numerous referrals from other federal agencies (FBI,
State, Army, etc.).

Due to delays in the appointment of its members and the
time required to hire and clear a staff, the ARRB did not
actually begin reviewing documents until May 1995. It became
Clear in immediately that the ARRB would require the release
of far more information than the Agency had released in the
1992-94 review. In mid-1995 HRG began a re-review of the
previously released sanitized documents:

* approximately 80% of the 227, 000 pages release in
1993-94 contained deletions

* resources were taken from other projects and added
to JFK project to meet Board's monthly deadlines.

II. The JFK Act and the ARRB

Mandated review and declassification projects can be
two-edged swords. The JFK Act forced the Agency to review
records that should have been opened years ago. The legal
requirement to presume release, backed up by an independent
review, resulted in the opening of documents that clearly
would not have been released under other programs. However,
the Act and the Review Board created by the Act imposed un-
realistic deadlines, inflexible standards and procedures
which created a major drain on all Agency review resources
and had. an over-all negative effect on the Agency's release
program.

Unrealistic Deadlines: The release dates set by the
Act did not take into account the start-up time and costs
(searches, inventorying and indexing) of a project of this
Magnitude, nor the time it would then take for a page-by-
page review and sanitization of classified documents. For
example, initial indexing of the collection was done on a

-crash basis using overtime employees and resulted ina

flawed database. The revising, re-indexing and updating of
that database took several thousand man-hours and continues
today.

Mandated Procedures: NARA's and ARRB's interpretation

‘of the law created a time-consuming, labor-intensive review

process that meant an inordinate amount of time was spent by
13-00000

both the Agency and Board staff on issues which were
marginal to the story and to processing decisions by the
Board. For example:

a. Under the JFK Act. every piece of paper in the
collection was considered a “unique” assassination record.
The result is a staggering amount of chaff and duplication.
For example, one cable was files and processed 58 times in
the collection.

b. The ARRB required that all sanitized documents be
reviewed by the Board and that each postponement (deletion)
be acted on individually. Even after the Board changed
procedures and accepted staff recommendations instead of
reviewing each document, the detailed tracking, recording
and coding of every deletion within each document required
processing resources well beyond what would be considered

‘reasonable for such a project. A most sanitized documents

contained multiple deletions (one contained more than 1600
deletions and many over 100).

. Inflexible Standards: The level of evidence required
by the Board to postpone what was generally considered
protectable information was extremely high and usually
required documentation of “current harm”. Defenses based on
general principles such as official cover or sources and
methods were not acceptable. This required the Agency to
dedicate significant resources to prepare evidence to
support recommended postponements. Again, much time was
spent on issues that were marginal to the JFK story. For
example, several major evidence packages involving several
offices and presentations by senior agency officers and
officials were needed to secure Board agreement to protect
Agency physical locations and names of employees and other
persons not related to the JFK story.

Three times during the six years of the project, including
most of this past year, the JFK review effectively shut down
all other aspects of the Historical Review Program and had
to borrow additional resources from other offices and review
projects to meet deadlines. The JFK review will continue to
require a significant portion of HRP's resources through
FY99.

IIL. The Process and Lessons Learned

There are a number of basic lessons from the JFK review
that are applicable to other historical/systematic review
projects:

can be either managerial or substantive.

Memo for the Record
Subject: JFK Records Review - Lessons Learned

The CIA's JFK Collection is made up primarily of
records pulled together for the Warren Commission, House
Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the ~
Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB). It contains a
significant amount of duplication and non-JFK related
material. The current index is flawed and contains gaps.
Release standards were liberal; basically only source
identities and information, names of agents, employees under
cover, Agency locations and foreign liaison activities were
redacted. There is no evidence in the Collection to indicate
that the Warren Commission conclusions were wrong.

Memo for the Record
Subject: JFK Records Review Project and Lessons Learned

The CIA's JFK Collection is made up primarily of
records pulled together for the Warren Commission, House_
Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the
Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB). It contains a
significant amount of duplication and non-JFK related
material. The current index is flawed and contains gaps.
Release standards were liberal; basically only source

redacted. There is no evidence in the Collection to indicate
that the Warren Commission conclusions were wrong.

I. Background (1992-1995)

The setting up of the Historical Review Program by DCI
Gates in early 1992 coincided with growing interest in
Congress to require federal agencies to declassify records
related to the assassination of President Kennedy. DCI Gates
decided to start declassification process before Congress
passed legislation:

* testified before Congress on 12 May 1992 about CIA*s
new openness policy and announced the declassification
of the first folder of Oswald's 201 (also known as the
pre-assassination file).

* six boxes of the Oswald's 201 were reviewed and
transferred to NARA by Oct. 1992.

‘The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection
Act of 1992 (JFK Act) was signed 26 October 1992:

* it called for Presidential-appointed Assassination
Records Review- Board composed of non-government
individuals;

* established’ “a presumption of immediate disclosure”

for records relating to the assassination.

For first two years of its existence, the Historical
Review Program focused primarily on the review of JFK
assassination records:
