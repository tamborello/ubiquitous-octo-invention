 

 

ROSTOW:

 

i ROSTOW testified that during his entire tenure in government, he —

Ve

NN “Revert heard_a reference to Executive Action or "such a capability or

 

speh an intention to act by the U.S." (10) He has no recollection of

 

ir'structing BISSELL to establish such a capability. (10) He testified

 

that he was "morally certain" (13) that such a discussion was “unlikely
to the point of being virtually unthinkable" qu) for a number of reasons:
1. Such a discussion would be memorable. (11)

2. The division of national security responsibility between ROSTOW

and BUNDY "excluded me from the covert operations business." (11)

 

3. He believes that assassination historically has proven counter- —
productive and it would be especially so for an open society like the
U.S. where leaders are vulnerable to attack. (11) ,

4. Assassination is morally "repugnant" to ROSTOW. (11)

5. By January 25-26, ROSTOW had been in the Administration less than

 

 

a_week and had heavy responsibilities concerning the USSR and Laos thrust .

upon him for immediate consideration. He found it "incredible" that he

 

_ "would go launching off in that week with suggestions for the planning"
(15) of an extraordinarily sensitive operation. i:
6. He had no knowledge at the time that any such planning or opera- i.

tion was ongoing. (15-16) . f
7. The State Department luncheon meetings were too open a forum

in which to raise such a suggestion; only the first of those meetings

 

 

   

   

HW 54653 Docld:32423557 Page 9
could have been held before January 26, 1961. (21-23)

 

 

ROSTOW does, however, have a calendar notation of a meeting with
BISSELL and BUNDY at the Hay-Adams Hotel on January 27, 1961 (Staff In-
terview, 7/8 ); he has been asked to submit an affidavit on this meet-
ing. |

ROSTOW explained the discrepancy between his testimony and that of
his "close personal friend" (4) by saying that BISSELL's memory of the
period may be blurred by the traumatic experience of the Bay of Pigs

“which occurred shortly afterward. (55) In the event of a blurred memory,

ROSTOW felt that. he and BUNDY might have been used as possible WHITE

 

HOUSE contacts in BISSELL's mind because they were "his closest friends —
in the WHITE HOUSE at that time." (17) ROSTOW also suggested that un-
der ALLEN DULLES, the CIA fell into the habit of operating "quasi-auton-
omously" without correct clearance from the PRESIDENT (27-28) -- a habit
which may have produced a "compulsion" to place a retrospective blessing

upon the operation. (19)

BUNDY:

BUNDY does recall being told about the development of. an Executive

Action capability "in a general way" (4): as an untargeted (5) "capa-
bility coming into being" rather than a mounted operation. (7) Bundy

 

testified:

"I am sure I gave no instruction. But it is only fair to
add that I do not recall that I offered any impediment after
I was briefed. (10) ...I wouldn't have the authority to give

_ HARVEY:

 

HARVEY confirmed the accuracy of the I.G. REPORT version of his —
initial discussion of Executive Action with BISSELL. (36-37; 6/25)
HARVEY testified that his "net impression" from the discussion with

BISSELL was that both Executive Action and the ongoing poison pill

 

assassination plot were "fully authorized and approved" (54; 6/25),
although no specific individual in the "WHITE HOUSE" was mentioned.
(81; 6/25) HARVEY said that after his initial meeting with BISSELL,
he discussed the propriety and feasibility of assassination with se-

lected CIA officers, who generally expressed a "negative reaction."

 

(40; 6/25) After a subsequent meeting with BISSELL, HARVEY continued pene
to develop the assassination capability without mounting an operation

or communicating the objective to any potential asset who was being ;

d

assessed. (45; 6/25)

 

Chronology. HARVEY has notes (see attachment ) of two meetings. to
discuss Executive Action which he is "almost certain" took place in a
1961. (51; 6/25) On January 25, he met with SIDNEY GOTTLIEB, the new . i
Chief of CIA's Technical Services Division. On the following day, he
met with ARNOLD SILVER, who recruited agent QUWIN -- the only agent:
HARVEY ever employed in Project ZRRIFLE (for the purpose of "spotting"

potential assets). (50-55; 6/25) HARVEY said that these meetings took

my op een

place after his initial discussion of Executive Action with BISSELL,

thus placing that meeting in "early January." (52; 6/25)”

~ Conflict on Knowledge/Authorization. BISSELL began his testimony

 

 

with uncertainty about any "urgings" from the WHITE HOUSE. At a later. , —
point, he said: "There is little doubt in my mind that Project RIFLE

was discussed with ROSTOW and possibly BUNDY." (16) He expressed the
' !

 

belief that the PRESIDENT knew of the project, although BISSELL admitted

 

to having "no direct knowledge". of this. (56; 6/9) But at another
point, BISSELL testified that it was a "possibility" that the CIA ini-
tiated the project:

"it was the normal practice in the Agency and an important
part of its mission to create various kinds of capability
long before there was any reason to be certain whether
those would be used....So it would not be particularly sur-
prising to me if the decision to create...this capability
had been taken without an outside request." (67-68; 6/9)

 

When BISSELL returned again to the theme that "it may have been

initiated within the Agency," he characterized his conversation with :

 

ROSTOW more as a briefing than as receiving an instruction from ROSTOW.
(80-81; 6/9)

 

Generally, BISSELL recalls that in any discussion with ROSTOW or pe
BUNDY, "all aspects of the creation of the capability" (50; 6/11) would - ;
have been mentioned. BISSELL said it was "quite possible" that he dis—
cussed CASTRO, TRUJILLO, and LUMUMBA with ROSTOW as examples of assas— :
sination targets. (50; 6/11) BISSELL said that the subject might have ye
arisen at the weekly luncheon meetings at the State Department attended i
by BUNDY, ROSTOW, and representatives from State, CIA, and Defense.

TO : Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr. and Curtis Smothers
FROM: Frederick Baron

DATE: July 16, 1975
RICHARD BISSELL: SUMMARY OF PERTINENT TESTIMONY

I, EXECUTIVE ACTION (Project ZRRIFLE): Early 1961 -
I.G. REPORT, 1967: According to HARVEY, "early in the KENNEDY ad-

ministration BISSELL called him in to discuss what HARVEY refers to as
‘ an Executive Action Capability; i.e., a general stand-by capability to
‘carry out assassinations when required. HARVEY's notes quote BISSELL
as saying, 'The WHITE HOUSE -has twice urged me to create such a capa-
bility.' BISSELL recalls discussing the question of developing a gen-
eral capability with HARVEY." (37)
On February 19, 1962, new DDP RICHARD HELMS approves the Handling
of the project on a "special basis," including unvouchered funds au-

thorized by HARVEY's certification. (39)

BISSELL:
BISSELL recalls "assigning HARVEY the task of undertaking the

ZRRIFLE project," but he does not recall "a specific conversation with
anybody in the WHITE HOUSE as the origin of that request." (51; 6/9)

BISSELL said, however, "I have no reason to believe that HARVEY's quote

(about_WHITE HOUSE urgings) is wrong." (51; 6/9) BISSELL recalled
turning the project over to HELMS and briefing him on it. (53; 6/11)

INTERVIEW AND ME} TING SUMMARY , Pege 1 of

 

. : FILE:
Interview by telephone (203-677-1792) with Richard Bissell on

August 6, 1975 (6:00 p.m:) conducted by Joseph di Genova. (Bissell's
office: 203-677-2063).

. I reviewed for Mr. Bissell the new domments related to the |

July 1960 incident. This included the July 21, 1960 cable from

Langley indicating that the ''Possible removal of the top three

Cuban leaders being given serious consideration at HQS."" Mr. Bissell's
independent recollection of that and-events about which he had ; on
previously testified was not jogged. He said that cable "is just

further evidence bearing on the state of mind in Washington toward
the Cuban operation." At this point I traced for him the steps of :
E, H. Hinkle, who sent out the July 21, 1960 cable, and explained
Hinkle's recollection concerning Barnes involvement in the writing

of the cable. Bissell then noted that "Barnes would probably have

told me about it at the time."

When asked about the langauge "receiving serious consideration,"
Bissell said that "that suggests to me that the idea was indeed
receiving. serious consideration and that headquarters was anxious
to explore the possibility with the asset." "Dulles would have
known that this was being considered.’ When informed that the
cable was subsequently superceded by a cable telling Havana to
“Drop Matter’ Bissell said that Dulles probably considered this
particular effort ''too risky, because we didn't know enough about
the asset, and because too many innocent people would have been
killed by crashing a plane.'! He speculated that Dulles may have
ordered the cancellation of the first cable because the plan did
not involve the killing of all three of the top leaders but rather
only one, Raul Castro Ruz.

I informed Bissell that J.C. King said that he was probably
circumvented on this particular matter; i.e., the incident and |
also the serious consideration. Bissell remarked that he would !
be "surprised that King said that he would have been excluded \
from that type of thing.'’ Bisseli could remember no cases where i
J.C. King was not kept fully informed. In this matter, Bissell i
noted that "serious consideraton in the cable meant that discussions |
occurred between Dulles, myself, Cabell, Barnes and King."' "Barnes '
was very Close to Allen Dulles and me and if Barnes told Hinkle i
to send that cable with those words 'serious consideration! in it, i
he would have known what he was talking about." "Barnes simply would i
not have sent such a cable unless he knew for a fact that it was
receiving serious consideration." Bissell then added that one reason
to suppose that the matter was receiving serious consideration was
that the cable authorized an “approach to the asset, which as you
know, is a risky act. Barnes would not have said in the cable that
inquiry should be made of the asset unless he had reason to believe
that such an operation was being very seriously considered. And
he would have only thought that if it had gotten beyond the think-
tank level at the agency.''! . |
