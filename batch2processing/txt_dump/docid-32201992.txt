on the above information.

: On January 5, 1959, Mr. W. SHANLEY, U. S. Customs,
Miami, Florida, advised that CHARLES WILLIAM HORMEL had had
three passengers on his trip to Grand Cayman Island, BWI, son
October 26, 1958. Mr. SHANLEY identified them as follows:

1. ALBERTO CRESCENCIO de la CRUZ MENENDEZ OLITE
2. OSVALDS ANTCNIO CASTELL y VALDEZ, also known
as ANTONIO GUZMAN
3. ALBERTO BLANCO ROMARIZ.

SHANLEY stated that no action was taken by Customs
against MENENDEZ or CASTELL, who were left at Cayman by
HORMEL, or against BLANCO, who supposedly returned to Miami
with HORMEL after HORMEL left MENENDEZ and CASTELL.

_ MENENDEZ said that-he had never used the name
