ALERT IN ORTENTE PROVINCE BELIEVED TO BE; TERMINATED

 

The alert in Oriente Province (see 2/o] _huss- 63) is be-
lieved to be terminated. The alert, apparently. “prompted by
President KENNEDY‘s death on 22 November, was possibly pre-
scheduled to-terminate on 25 November. There have been 'two orders
which suggest that the alert was destined to be concluded on

25 November; they are: . ‘

1) Access. to the Coastal Observation Post at Puhta
Maisi (20-15N 74-09W) was restricted until 25 November: because
of the alert (see 2/qs|_R667- 63); and .

2) Subordinates of Banes, Headquarters Eastern Neval
District, were to receive further orders on ‘the. 25th, presumably
concerning their alert status (2/0 RLI6-63) 5; no° such. orders
have been noted in communications, =

44USC2107(5)(g)(2)(D)
b (iii)

There have been no further references in intercepted. -¢émmuni-
cations to the alert since 02227 on 23 Noweniber, (21Q8[__}8667-63) .

It is possible that the restricted ‘access to the Observation
Post at Punta Maisi extends .to- other Observation Post's in Oriente
Province such as reported ” on 23 November when First’ Army Coastal.
Observation Posts “were placed in an alert status.-
(2/LR1 188- -63), and that the restriction mas to be lifted on
25 November by all those posts.

Further indication that the alert has’ terminated is the fact
that the Cuban Navy was engaged in an island-wide communications
exercise on 25 November. It is considered unlikely that such an
exercise would be conducted under alert conditions.

There have been no further ——— to the alert status
of the (D percent Santiago de Guba) units which was first ob-
served on 23 November (2/sL[___yRO5-63). All CRAF and Soviet
Forces‘Cuba communications appear to be normal during this
period, 22-26 November 1963.
