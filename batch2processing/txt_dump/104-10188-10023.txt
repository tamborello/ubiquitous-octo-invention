ACTION REQUIRED; None. For your information,
REFERENCE “3 HMMA+39,679, 28 October 1970

1. Primary responsibility for the operational and
administrative handling of the LIEMPTY Project was transferred,
effective 1 December 1970, within the Station from the RED'TOP .
to the Operational Support Section, This transfer was made
aS part of our effort to consolidate basic Support functions
in the Operational Support Section, and to relieve the REDTOP
Section of activities which do not contribute directly to the
pursuit.of priority recruitment targets, However, the REDTOP
Section will continue to be the principal consumer of the
LIEMPTY product as received from the LILYRIC and LICALLA
photo surveillance points, It will also be the maio provid
er of guidance and requests for special LILYRIC/LICALLA

é . -
coverage, . Pa

   

2, The provioug REDTOP Case Officer (Bruce H, FERNALD)
introduced the new Case Officer, Howard T, -BAGAUS, to LIEMPTY~
9, -13, and ~14 in early December, LIMOUSINE, owner of the
LILYRIC property, will continue to be handled by Timothy M.
ARCHBOLD of the REDTOP Saction.
