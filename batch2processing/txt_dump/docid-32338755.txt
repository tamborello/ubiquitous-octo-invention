SUE LAWSON. Wife of JOHN HOWARD LARSON was a member of Branch K
- prior to the reorganization and.is now a member of the Valley Branch. (Reé-
ords of SUE LAWSON are not included in the enclosure but they are available

in tha Los Angeles Office)

It will be noted from a perusal of the. enclosed photographic .
copies that the last names of the people herein before named were not showm
on the records. However the descriptive data and other records and past
activities of these persons leave no doubt that they are.the persons referred

_ to; for-example, on Page 2 HERBERT ia described as being from: Hollywoodland.
which is a neighborhood district where BIBERMAN lives and where no other Com-
muniste known te this office by the name of HERBERT resides. ‘The same is
true of "ED B" described as. being from Holiywoodiand. EDWARD BIBERMAN re-
sides in Hollywoodland adjacent to HERBERT BIBERMAN. It is further noted

4 on Page Eight that "JHL" is a writer who resides in the "Valley". JOHN

« HOWARD LAWSON does. reside in North Hollywood which is considered part of

| San Fernando Valley and is commonly known as the "Valley".

BETH LEACH obtained were transmitted to the Bureau by cover letter dated

{ of the members therein named. Ah interpretation of the records, together
with a pertinent memorandum explaining the reorganization of the Horthwest
