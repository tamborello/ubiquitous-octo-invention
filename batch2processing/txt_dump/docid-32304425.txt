a professional gambler and confidence man, was last reported
in the Denver area by DN 123-¢ during the latter part of
August, 1953. On that occasion DN 123-C accompanied CLARK,
ERNIE B. WOODARD and VICTOR EMANUEL PEREIRA to Chicago,
Illinois, to attend a convention of vending machine dealers.

Chicago principally for the purpose of attending the conven-
tion, where they expected to make a lot of money in crooked
gambling operations.

rented a residence.

representing himself as a business associate of PEREIRA and
BRADING in the operation of a vending machine business in
Beverly Hills.

that they had no information reflecting that CLARK has been
operating in the Denver area since August, 1953, although he
still occasionally makes brief visits to Denver, where he is
in contact with SAM GARFIELD and IRVING PASTERNAK who are
associated with the Crude Oil Producing Corporation,, 16.0

approximately $48,000.00. These sentences have been
upheld by the Fifth U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

This decision has been appealed to the U. S. Supreme
Court and the matter was argued before that court during
the period of this survey. However, no decision has yet
been published by the U. S. Supreme Court. Both BRADING
and PEREIRA are at liberty on bond pending disposition of
their appeal.

-As previously reported, PEREIRA is now married to
the former Mrs. LEE LITTLE of Dallas, ‘Texas, reported to
be worth several miliion dollars.

 

During the period of this survey, DN 115-C,
DN 123-C and DN 119-C have reported that PEREIRA and his.
wife, and EUGENE BRADING have been living on Mrs. PEREIRA's—
monéy in Beverly Hills, California, where PEREIRA and BRADING
have been representing themselves as operators of a vending
machine business.

DN 115-C and DN 123-C, who have previously reported
that PEREIRA and BRADING in the ‘past have spent much of
their time in the Denver area, have stated.that neither

PEREIRA nor BRADING has been in Denver since August, 1953.

The Bureau has instructed the Denver Division and
other interested offices to.maintain regular contact with
informants for the purpose of being advised at all times’as
to the whereabouts of PEREIRA and BRADING, in view of
persistent reports from various sources reflecting that
PERETRA and BRADING might seek to flee the United States in
the event the U. S. Supreme Court upholds their twelve-year
sentences. a
