Although the source has not observed nor heard anything of
SPIEGEL, it is believed that the fact that the source is
occasionally in the IPS building will enable him to be in an
advantageous position to observe SPIEGEL or any other of the

New Left fugitives should they make contact with-persons at

On 10/13/71, the source advised that sometime during
September, 1971, MALONE had discussed the subject of FBI
surveillance of IPS with him. She told the source that she
and others at IPS believed the FBI was watching them from a
pbuilding across the street, from a room in the Dupont Plaza
Hotel (to the right of the IPS building) and possibly from the
building on the other side of the IPS building. It was further
believed that the IPS building was "bugged" and that the FBI
was using sophisticated electronic equipment to pick up con-
versations in and around IPS. Because of these suspicions,

The source advised that he has never been arrested
although he has been detained by law enforcement personnel on
several o¢casions. A search of the files of the Metropolitan
Police Department and U.S. Park Police disclosed no record
identifiable with the source under his true name or any of his
aliases. A check of NCIC reflected no warrants for the source
under his true name or aliases.

A review of WFO indices reflects that the’ source was
the subject of WF 87-18178. Under the name JAMES R. MONROE,
the source had, during May, 1970, cashed three checks totalling
$225.00 at Charleston, West Virginia, on a bank in Washington,
D.C. The checks were returned to the Charleston Bank. Prosecu-
tion in this matter was declined on 2/23/71, by AUSA ROBERT B.
KING, Southern District of West Virginia, because the amount
of money involved and evidence available did not justify further
investigative efforts to locate and interview MERRITT.

The source explained that he had at one time cashed
several checks amounting to a little over $200 while he visited
’ Charleston, West Virginia, during the Spring, 1970. He stated

that he has made efforts to negotiate payment of these checks
_and that he has at no other time and will never again engage
in this practice.

sexual and this has brought him into contact with other homo-
sexuals who engage in various types of criminal activities. The

involved in a homicide, narcotics, armed robberies, burglaries
and other crimes to the Metropolitan Police Department.
