2. You will recall that some months ago I protested
the fact that you nzo transferred a staggeringly large aavance
to our books agaiast Henry Hyde, a great part of waich had been
outstanding for nezriy tro years. I was reluctant at tnat :

amounts end I stili feei that eaco one ot our field offices ;
