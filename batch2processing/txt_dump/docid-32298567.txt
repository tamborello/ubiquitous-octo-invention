The subject continues her close association with
JAMES and ANN LEE of the "China Daily News", and she and her
husband attended the annual celebration at the "China Daily
News" as they have done in pst years.

On 5/4/67, NY 5225-S* was visited at his home by the subjet
and her husband. The subject said they were in the informant's
neighborhood and decided to visit the informant. The visit was
social in nature, and there was very little political discussion. (H(A)

Since this time, NY 5225-S* has been assigned by the
CPUSA to the Professional Section of the CPUSA. Because of this,
it is felt that it is unlikely that there will be any further
contact between the subject and NY 5225-84 uu)

Iranian students.@In this regard, the NYO ie exploring the

Subject_has, in the past, lectured to groups of OO
possibility of put

ing NY [567 in contact with the subject,

. . on 8/2/67, the subject attempted to contact LEO

HUBERMAN at the offices of "Monthly Review". As pointed out in

relet, the subject only contacts HUBERMAN just prior to or subsequent
to a trip abroad.

 

an On 8/10/67, the subject attempted to contact IRA :
i GOLLOBIN. She said at this time that she was trying to renew ‘
her passport and wanted some legal advice. :

It appears from the above that the subject is
contemplating another trip abroad.

The subject's recent activities conform to the
pattern of her activities over the course of this investigation.

Recommendations of the NYO - “ . :

The NYO is constantly alert to the possibility of
developing. the contacts of the subject as informants. However, -
the subject's contacts are very limited. They are almost
exclusively individuals who are pro-Chinese Communist or at
least individuals with a long history of leftist activity. '
