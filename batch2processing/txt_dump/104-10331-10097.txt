Director Howard Osborn reporting a meeting between former OS
Director, Colonel Sheffield Edwards and John Roselli, a-
Mafia figure. ;

*27 May 1966 Memo to the Director of the FBI from Howard
Osborn detailing a phone conversation between Colonel
Edwards, James O'Connell of OS and John Roselli.

2. In summary, OS concurs with HRG in the full
declassification and release of the two memos. It is noted
the relationship between OS and Mafia personalities has been
documented in great detail not only in prior official
releases but newspapers and other periodicals.

Additionally, it appears the release of the memos will not
adversely affect Agency sources or methods of collection.
