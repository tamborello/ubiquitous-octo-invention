MEMORANDUM FOR: Office of Troining Registrar

THROUGH t TO/ORD
SUBJECT 1 Evaluation of Contract Management Institute
Course

1, 2 attended the Contract Management Inetitute on 28 to
course I submitted ex

tenaive comments to DD/S&T ceordinator for the
courses, and I understand that those commenta were included in
the overall recoumendations for future changes,

2, Since three and one-half months have transpired since
conpletion of that course, details such as the names of speakers
and subject matorial are a bit hazy but I will repeat my overall
renction to it for whatever benefit’ it might afford. The course

material was good although it eould ‘have been oriented much more

toward tecinical project managers rather than adminiatrative
officers, to the ultimate benevit of DD/S&T., Two of the speakers
wore excellent; however, the third, who also was apparently
Director of the Institute was very poor beth with respect to hig
understanding of the material mid his presentation, Dr, Xennedy
of Notre Dame ond the lawyer, whose name I do not racull, were

excolient.

3. Thies waa primarily a sales piteh for CPIF contracts.
My personal impreaaten was that U.S. Government contracting agea-
cies havo just about completed the circte of 2 great procurement

fiaaes,
with various avard arrangements, the ¢ontract negotiators vere

unable. to really ever define sost and ended up invariably in

for’

in depurting from fixed~prica and CPFF centrsats to CPIP'’s

giving away sdditional foes ta the contractors for nothing received,

Definitive costs were alwaya a function of expertenced and sound
