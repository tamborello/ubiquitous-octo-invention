Copy of referenced airtel concerning possible
deportation of Giancana not being forwarded to Legat,
Mexico City. wy

It is noted Mexican authorities have been cognizant
of Giancana'siresidence and it is not felt that the Bureau
should attempt in any way to influence the decision of the
Mexican Immigration Service in connection with its legal
responsibilities relative to Giancana's presence in Mexico. 54 ~

NOTE: Giancana, former Chicago underworld leader, has resided in
Mexico since his voluntary exile from the United States in 1966 £ His
presence has been known to the Mexican Government; Recently, Legat, ~
Mexico City furnished Giancana's Mexican addresses to the new
Mexican Assistant Secretary of Government who expressed an_interest
and observed that Giancana would be subject to deportation, Chicago
feels if Giancana is deported he may resume leadership of organized
crime activities in Chicago and in view of the undesirability of: this,
Legat, Mexico City should make no positive efforts to encoumge the ,
Mexican Government to deport subject. Chicago airtel not being
forwarded to Legat because it is felt the Bureau should not intefere
in any way with the legal responsibilities of Mexican Immigration
Authorities relative to Giancan u ~,

It appéars to the Chicago offive- that~it_is in the
“best interests of the Bureau and the Chicago Office that ~.
GIANCANA remain in Mexico, or at least away from the Chicago
area, The reason for this is that with the continued absencg
of GIANCANA from the Chicago area the vacuum created by his

is noted ‘that when GIANCANA was the "boss" of organized crime > Ae
in Chicago he asserted a strong and aggressive and capable yY ~!

For these reasons the absence of GIANCANA has
left a void in the direction of organized crime which has
had a salutary effect insofareas the Bureau is concerned, \\

' However, should GIANCANA be forced out of Mexico me
and should he then decide that it would be tothe best interests o*
of organized crime to return to Chicago and resume his ~
leadership position, the above salutary effect would be
dissipated, \

It is therefore suggested, UACB that the Legat
Mexico City make no positive effort to encourage the Mexican
Government to deport GIANCANA and that their dealings with
the Mexican Government should be conducted in such a ma rv,
as to’ consider the above opinion of the Chicago Office )
