negligible. Through further inquiry at the bank, it was
ascertained that SNFE officials were bypassing the account
by sending through any. sizable checks "for collection". and
apparently maintaining their cash in a safety deposit
box at the bank. In monitoring the account, it had
previously indicated that various delegations had been
transmitting funds to the national headquarters and it is
. Logical to presume’ that the Cleveland delegation has done so.
Since the SNFE in Miami appears. to be handling all financial
. transactions on a cash basis, further monitoring of their
account is not considered warranted. (2

Referenced. Birmingham airtel requested Miami furnish
any information to be found in the files of the Miami Office
regarding MARIO SALVADOR. '

A review of the indices of the Miami Office regarding
MARIO SALVADOR reflects no additional information.

Referenced Detroit letter set out lead for Miami
to check files and advise Detroit of the documentations concerning
"Cuba" and "Correo" and whether copies were desired by Miami.
Adequate documentation of. these publications is contained in this
report and all copi of these puplications are furnished to
Miami by MM 847-S. (OU . }

Bureau airtel May 11, 1964, instructed that appropriate
informants and sources be alerted to furnish any information
indicating the SNFE is planning to leave for invasion or
Anfiltration of Cuba. MM 847-S has been instructed frequently

and at regular intervals to immediately furnish any information
indicating imminent action of this type on the part of the SNFE.
He is fully aware of the importance of doing this and of the
Bureau's interest. Other Cuban sources have been alerted to
appropriately furnish such information. (y W
