Boe ™ : LIE chon asked those present whesmys they were
acquainted with a revolutionary group in the San Francisco Bay
area to which Rita PHIPPS remarked being familiar with ‘the Bay
Area Revolutionary Union; and its publication, "Red Paper”
Within this context LIE mentioned knowing Susan WINE (or

(or WARREN) (phonetic) in New York and also Marg RUSSEL,
Americans who are associated with China. Marg RUSSEL is about

77 years old and used to live in China but for the past ten years
has been travelling across the U.S.A. "telling the truth about | :
China™ to universities, church groups, etc. She is editor of a

' paper called Far Eastern Reporter and, in LIE's opinion, isa,

“very advanced communist. ; an

,

 

 

; According to LIE, Marg RUSSEL told him about this

“[ $28 Francisco Bay area group and invited him to go out to the
| West coast not realizing that he planned. to go there anyway. “"Tney”
i are forming a communist party on both the East and West coast, and
| Marg RUSSEL told LIE that people from China or people who visit

.| China are assisting in the formation of this party so as to ;

| ensure it has a correct political orientation. Marg RUSSEL also
| told LIE this new party would be more advanced than the Black he
| Panthers or the.American Communist Workers movement . .

. LIE mentioned that he and nis wife are also acquainted |
with Sterling NEWBERRY and his wife, NEWBERRY being another political’
activist in the U.S.A. He recalled that about four-years ago the :
NEWBERRYs lost their jobs as teachers oecause of their political
activities and although they were not then pro-Maoist, they did
profess to be socialists. Later, they wrote to Liz from Cleveland ©

“ saying they intended to go to New York, and that they. now oelieved =~:

. ._ LIE met them in New York and took them to "our" Loos a
_ friend Susan WINE (or WONG) (or WARREN) (phonetic) to talk about =~ af
the political situation in America.. We also talked apout Sterling / a
-NEWBENRY's newspaper, "The Workers Advocate”, which has since been a
changed to "Mass Lines". LIE expressed the view that "Mass Lines”
is not really a mass paper, the masses don't read it, and haven't ~
even heard about it. It is too theoretical and doesn't try to :
understand the problems of the people whereas the Black Panther
paper, although not as elevated in political content, is far more.
to the point and has a circulation of about 250,000 weekly as
compared to about 1000 for "Mass Lines", LIE considers NEWBERRY |
. to be sort of arrogant, and easily angered by any form of criticisn;
. ° ‘he also- feels that NEWBERRY is prone to exaggeration about his»
own power and. infiuence. ;

  

 

Conversation was interrupted at this point by the
arrival of a Mrs. Dora TONG and Mr. TONG whom LIE introduced as
his friends. At another point he referred to his iehda TANG
Ying-shen (phonetic), who may be identical to one of the TONGs.. *.
LIE remarked that he would have to. leave soon-to take his friends.

‘PU Chao-min told a reliawle source he had been contacted by

.Rita PHIPPS of New York who was then visiting Ottawa, Ontario,
“and, at her request, PU had agreed to meet PHIPPS at the N.C.N.A..

that he had a particularly busy schedule for the following day

On September 2, 1970, prior to Rita PHIPPS! 10:00 aeme
appointment, PU was visited by a male individual named Mr. LIE ;
(phonetic) who, although he spoke a few words in Chinese, conversed

with PU almost entirely in English. LIE was evidently from the
U.S.A. and although he didn't mention his address, he aid say

he was in the process of moving to Seattle where he hopes to.
return to graduate studies. He mentioned further that about ;
five years ago he was working towards a Doctorate in Theoretical
-Physics and did a lot. of research work for the National Science vo
Foundation in America. He claimed to be the only scientist in. © 7). |
his field to have. obtained a grant: from that. institution. re

‘\apolitical. but. nad developed a dislike for China because of what
_ the read in the bourgeois press. . Then, when "they" started olaming
“the Vietnam war on Chinese aggression he started studying about
China and formed a completely opposite opinion. This prompted a
* @ecision on his part to convey the results of hiscresearch in
- . Theoretical Physics to China rather than to the capitalist U.S.
“Government, so he wrote a letter to Dr. NEEDHAM, a professor in
- England, requesting NEEDHAM's assistance in obtaining entry to ;
