SERVICE -- You previously have been informed regarding CIA’s Contact
Division which has had offices in. various U. S. cities and which is openly
identified as being connécted with CIA. This division has been responsible

- for the overt collection of positive intelligence gained through interviews of
aliens, travelers, businéssmen, etc. The division has not been engaged
in any operational activity such as the development of double agents. For
your information, CIA has-reorganized this. division and it is now called
the Domestic Contact Service.

An examination of CIA's activities in the area of overt collection

of positive intelligence has indicated that" the Bureau can strengthen its
position by having our field offices’ establish direct contact with the local _

oifices of the Domestic Contact Service. (This pavticularly applies to those.
situations where the Bureau and CIA both have an interest in Soviet-bloc
and Yugoslav nationals, excluding those who are connected with embassies
or the United Nations. We recognize that CIA has a responsibility for
collection of positive intelligencelli. e. information regarding Soviet-bloc
capability in a particular research field)) which might be acquired from és)
such visitors hunt we cannot condone any CIA activity which might
interfere with Bureau operations. . You therefore are authorized to
establish liaison with local offices of the Domestic Contact Service.

In each case when you initiate any inquiry or investigation of alvisiting
Soviet-bloc national you should obtain from the local Domestic Contact.
Service the nature and extent of CIA interest and all pertinent information
which CIA has gained or may acquire in the future relating to our internal
security responsibilities. If you feel that CIA activity conflicts with
Bureau objectives, youi should so advise the Seat‘of Government, clearly
seiting forth your reasons. In this connection, there may be instances -
where continuing CIA pursuit of positive intelligence would conflict with
the Bureau s discharge of its internal security functions.

Very truly yours,

HUSTON PLAN AND RELATED DEVELOPMENTS

NOTH CONTINUED:

The Papich letter and memoranda, and the review of
the 38 possible grievances, contain comments and other information ‘
which could have an adverse effect on our current relationship ©
with CIA.

While numerous dates have been’ excised to protect the
identity of individuals, any reader can extrapolate the
approximate time of an event since Papich wrote his 3/13/70
letter following a chronological scheme from 1951 to 1970. There
is some chronological variance in the 3/5/70 letter.
