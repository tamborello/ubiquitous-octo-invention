! Special Agent John S. Portella proceeded to the area
of the Footlong Hotdog Restaurant and verified what the
infarmant had furnished and leamed that. the three carton .
boxes contained Master, No. 1, 12-4 place setings of dishes, .
Temperama Pattern with blue. -Both of the Thompson's admitted -
that these cartons were excess items and that they planned to return
them to the Beatty Trucking Company. .

Special Agent John S. Portella contacted Jim McDonald,
Beatty Trucking Company, who advised that the’dishes involved
‘in the three ‘boxes in question all came from the Canonsburg, Pa.
area and were being shipped to the Thorofare Markets in the ;
Pittsburgh area. He stated that all of the items on the truck
handled by the Thompson brothérs were intrastate items.
McDonald stated that while it is company policy that overages
are to be returned immediately, he does not expect the
truckers to drive all the way from Pittsburgh to .
Washington, Pa., to return three caztons when they can be
returned on their next trip to Washington, Pa., and that
he would contact the Thompsons and insure that this was done.

The noted circumstances so strongly indicate that
the Thompsons were converting the dishes in question to their
own purposes that it is the opinion of this office that. the
information furnished by this CI insured the return of the two
cartons, valued at $50 each, to.Beatty.

RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that the services of this
informant be continued. It. is recognized that his
productivity has been limited, but this is a. result of the
dislocation in his employment as described in the section
of this letter devoted to that matter, and‘an improvement in
this respect. is anticipated. There has been no reason to ;
question the reliability of any information that. the informant
has furnished and all expertence with him has indicated that he
is reliable, cooperative, loyal and definitely interested in
rendering any service he might to the FBI. It is also noted
that under present circumstances, this CI's services are m a cost-
free basis. . .

of Teamsters Local 249 that if their negotiations on a
local contract with A&P at Pittsburgh were unsuccéssful

they would be forced to accept the terms of amtional contract.

The implications to this'CL were that ratification of a local
contract was essential because A&P would receive benefits resulting
in cancellation if its proposed transfer of distribution
facilities from Pittsburgh to Salem, Ohio. Under a national
contract these special advantages would not be granted to A&P

and therefore the firm would proceed with its plans to move

out of Pittsburgh. ;

effect it would have'on Local 635. At the meetig in
Washington a question arose concerning the moving of A&P
facilities to Salem, Ohio, and Hoffa telephonically contacted Jokpas.y
angel: rather than Presser, and from the conversation

transpired, Hoffa acceded to Angelo in the nature of
seniority of the Youngstown men that would be transferred to
Salem, and it was decided that Pittsburgh men would gobehind
the last man from the Youngstown group in seniority status.

A week previous to this discussion in Washington,
James Matoney met with Hoffa alone and at that time Hoffa
did not concede any seniority standing to the Pittsburgh
group. - :

EMPLOYMENT
i :
3 Until February 24, 1964; this informant was
employed full time as a triick unloader for the Beatty
Motor Express Company, Washington, Pa., and unloaded that
‘company's trucks making deliveries in the Pittsburgh
district. He elected to do this type of work in order
to remain in and about Pittsburgh and exercised his
seniority in the Teamster's Union in order to gain it.
<QuFebruary 24, °1964, the Interstate Commerce Commission |
put into effect, new regulations barring trucking companies
from furnishing helpers for the loading and unloading of
their trucks at the points of origin or destination
without charging the shipper for such services. As a
result of this, the amount. of work available to informant
has been limited since that order went into
effect. So that in order to work regularly, he has had
to accept driving assignments and now works principally
as an over-the-road driver for Beatty Motor Express
Company. When he does obtain unloading. assignments, they ‘
are for unusually early morning hours-when he has little’,

contact with other workers.

LABOR MATTERS

On June 23, 1964, CI furnished current photographs
of 11 prominent, local Teamster Union officials which have
been retained in file for possible future use.

- On September 24, 1964, CI advised that Local 249
International Brotherhood of Teamsters (EBT), Pittsburgh,
is voting on September 27, 1964, on the ratification of a
contract with A&P and that both the company and the union's

' officials are obviously working to gain a favorable vote.

_ In this connection, source advised that James

Halbert, Pittsburgh District Supervisor of Transportation
and Warehousing for A&P, residence address 220 Orchard
Drive, Pittsburgh 35, Pa., has stated that negotiations
on a national level have been conducted in New York City
between the IBT. anda labor consultant firm which is
representing the A&P. . Two of the negotiators for the

From other. sources, CI advised he has learned that
Jimmy Hoffa, IBT President, desires ratification of ‘the A&P contract
and, at the same time that Avery and Lewis. were in New York
City, Tom Fagan, President of Local 249, was summoned to
Chicago where he met with Hoffa and an A&P representative from
the East in connection with ways of obtaining the desired
ratification. Subsequently, in the same connection, Fagan has
made two trips to New York City without divulging their
purpose to anyone. Fagan is most desirous of pleasing Hoffa
in this regard because Harry Tevis, Third International
Vice-President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
a Pittsburgh resident, is slated for removal from office by
either voluntary or involuntary means, and Fagan is the leading
contender to be his. replacement. ,
The source stated that the current grocery
warehouse strike situation in California is the result of
rank and file rebellion inopposition to the new:A&P,
contract. :

On October 5, 1964, CI. advised that at the time

Halbert mentioned the trip to New York by Avery and Lewis.
he commented "We finally got around to fighting you guys with
one of your own guys. We got Tony Pro's boys working for
us." He does not. recall that Halbert disclosed the name of

‘ the labor consultant firm employed by. A&P, but described the
firm only as "Tony Pro's firm." During subsequent contacts with
Halbert he has been unable to determine the identity of the
consultant firm.

CI advised that Hoffa is endeavoring to establish
a national contract, that he has achieved his goal within
the "Central Conference," and is endeavoring to obtain a
similar contract in the East. The. source explained that the
voting on September 27, 1964, by members’ of Local 249, related
to a national contract in that a failure t.o approve the proposed
contract with A&P locally would result in their being subjected
to the terms of a national contract similar to the one negotiated
in other sections of the country. Reportedly Fagan told members
