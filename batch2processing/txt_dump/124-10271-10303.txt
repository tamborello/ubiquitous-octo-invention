vamifications, and the Department still has a copy in its “~~

possession of a copy of this document and it was his impression
that Mr. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the
President, is aware of its existence. He also advised that
members of the SSC, with the knowledge of CIA Director Colby,
have had access to this document if not a copy of same in
their possession. Major Miles, upon instruction of John Clarke,
is visiting the various members of the intelligence community
mentioned by CIA in the document for the purpose of briefing
them concerning its existence and those portions which may
pertain to those agencies. He indicated that he had the
previous day briefed General Allen, Director of National
Security Agency (NSA), and Mr. Benson Buffham, Deputy Director.
From the document which Major Miles kept in his possession
at_all times, he cited numerous pages which made reference
to the FBI. The following items -: which are deemed pertinent
