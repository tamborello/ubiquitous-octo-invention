CIA REQUEST FOR BUREAU LECTURE on

ON COMMUNISM IN THE U, 8S.

 

Item Number 15 in the material submitted to the Director
by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses the Director's
refusal of a 1958 CIA request for WAMHE to lecture
on communism before a CIA group. Papich stated that CIA accepted
this as an affront and a blatant refusal to cooperate on a most
important subject of interest to both agencies, .

The files disclose that by letter. 9/25/58 signed by
VvVaM , CIA requested WAME to address a selected
group uP CIA personnel on the communist movement in the U. S.
CIA suggested dates of 12/9,10,or 11/58, The Director by routing
Slip attached to MAME — letter commented, "it seems strange
that CIA should seek this when its top representative in
considers FBI as a bunch of mere ‘flat-feet' and the dangérs
of communism as something conjured up in the minds of the FBI.
But then again I note request doesn't come from the Diréctor
: nor even the Deputy Director of CIA,"

Memorandum WVAHE to MAME dated 10/1/58
made reference to CIA's wequest arfd the Director's comments. It
recommended that the best interests of the Bureau would be served
by giving this lecture, not because of the information which
could be conveyed to CIA on communism in the U. S,, but because
it would give MAME an opportunity to raise 2 number of
questions himself of the group cotcerning CIA's own activities
in the field of communism, It was pointed out that it could be
‘considered a bit of a challenge to see how much thé FBI could
learn about the operation of CIA during the course of the lecture

and discussion rather than the converse, MAME recommended
that the request be declined and the Director concurred commenting,

"We cannot make # AME available to this outfit." on
