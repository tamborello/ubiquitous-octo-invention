18. In May 1962, because of Mr. O'Connell's assignment
to an overseas post, it was decided to turn Roselli over to
Mr. William Harvey, who was at that-time Chief, Task Force Ww.
Harvey was introduced as It is not known whether

Roselli ever became aware of Harvey's true name.

16. Of significant interest was an incident which involved
a request levied by Sam upon Maheu and now shapes up as a
potential flap.

At the height of the project negotiations, Sam
expressed concern about his girlfriend, Phyllis”
McGuire, who he learned was getting much atten-
tion from Dan Rowan while both were booked ata
Las Vegas night club. (Rowan, at that.time a rela-
tively unknown comedian, is now a partner in Rowan
and Martin, the summer replacement for the Dean
Martin coast-to-coast TV show.) Sam asked Maheu
to put a bug in Rowan's room to determine the ex-
tent of his intimacy with Miss McGuire. - Maheu
told Sam he didn't have the facilities, whereupon
Sam threatened to leave Miami to go to Vegas and
take care of the matter himself. In order to pre-
vent this, Maheu contacted Edward Dubois, a
Florida investigator, and asked him to handle the
job. ;

Instead of installing a bug in the room, the
technician placed a tap on the phone, which ob-
viously did not serve Sam's purpose. The techni-
cian involved in the assignment was discovered in
the process, arrested, and taken to the Sheriff's
office for questioning. After he failed to reach
Dubois by telephone, he called Maheu at the
Kenilworth Hotel, Miami, and informed him that
he had been detained by the police. This call was
made in the presence of the Sheriff's personnel,

Subsequently, the Department of Justice an-
nounced its intention to prosecute Maheu along
with the technician. On 7 February 1962, the
Director of Security briefed the Attorney General,
Robert Kennedy, on the circumstances leading up
to Maheu's involvement in the wiretap. At our re-
quest, prosecution was dropped.

Two articles appeared in the Chicago press,
one on 16 August 1963, and one on 20 August 1963,
that suggested Sam was working with the Agency.
The first article appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times
written by staff writer, Sandy Smith, and had as its
headline: CIA Sought Giancana Help for Cuba Spying.
It relates that the Agency reportedly was in touch
with Sam in 1959 and requested that he assist them
in obtaining intelligence out of Cuba. It also men-
tioned the Las Vegas wiretap, which the article
claimed was handled by a ''Florida investigative . .
organization. '' It further went on to state that,
upon inquiry of this organization, they stated the
tap was placed at the request of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. The other article appeared in the
Chicago Daily News, authored by Columnist Tony
Weitzel, and commented that during March 1962,
Sam confronted an FBI Agent who was shadowing
him and said, "Why don't you fellows leave me
alone? I'm one of you!’ Sam allegedly stated that,
after Castro's rise in Cuba, a ClA operative con--
tacted him and wanted to know if Sam could do any-
thing for the Government on the turbulent little island.
Sam said he had friends on both sides, but no clout.
That was it.

17. Roselli was introduced to James P, O'Connell, of this
Office, who was identified to him as an employee of Robert A.
Maheu, Associates. Over the several months of close contact be-
tween these two individuals, Roselli began to speculate as to
O'Connell's true employer and, at one point, stated that he was
convinced he was employed by the CIA, and that the project was
sponsored by the Agency. He hastened to state that he was not
forcing the issue, nor would he want confirmation of this and,
further, he would not mention this to anyone else, including Sam.
Sam was never introduced to any Agency personnel and, while CIA
was never mentioned to him, it is Maheu's belief he eventually sus-

' pected the Agency was the power behind the operation.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT : MAHEU, Robert A,

LOH

1, This memorandum is for information only.

2. In August 1960, Mr. Richard M. Bissell approached
Colonel Sheffield Edwards to determine if the Office of Security
had assets that may assist in a sensitive mission requiring
gangster-type action. The mission target was the liquidation of
Fidel Castro.

<

3. Because of its extreme sensitivity, only a small group
was made privy to the project. The DCI was briefed and gave his
approval. Colonel J. C. King, Chief, WH Division, was briefed,
but all details were deliberately concealed from any of the
JMWAVE officials. Certain TSD and Commo personnel partici-
pated in the initial planning stages, but were not witting of the
purpose of the mission.

4, Robert A. Maheu was contacted, briefed generally on
the project, and requested to ascertain if he could develop an en-
tree into the gangster elements as the first step toward accom-
plishing the desired goal,

5. Mr. Maheu advised that he had met one Johnny Roselli
on several occasions while visiting Las Vegas, He only knew
him casually through clients, but was given to understand that
he was a high-ranking member of the ''syndicate'" and controlled
all of the ice-making machines on the Strip. Maheu reasoned
that, if Roselli was in fact a member of the clan, he undoubtedly
had connections leading into the Cuban gambling interests.

6. Maheu was asked to approach Roselli, who knew Maheu
as a personal relations executive handling domestic and foreign
accounts, and tell him that he had recently been retained by a
client who represented several international business firms
which were suffering heavy financial losses in Cuba as a result
of Castro's action. They were convinced that Castro's removal
‘was the answer to their problem and were willing to pay a price
of $150, 000 for its successful accomplishment. It was to be made
clear to Roselli that the U. S. Government was not, and should not,
become aware of this operation. :

7. The pitch was made to Roselli on 14 September 1960 at
- the Hilton Plaza Hotel, New York City. His initial reaction was
to avoid getting involved but, through Maheu's persuasion, he
agreed to introduce him to a friend, Sam Gold, who knew the
"Cuban crowd." Roselli made it clear he did not want any money
for his part and believed Sam would feel the same way. Neither
of these individuals was ever paid out of Agency funds.

8. During the week of 25 September, Maheu was introduced
to Sam who was staying at the Fontainebleau Hotel, Miami Beach.
His initial impression of Sam was that of a hard, uncouth indi-~-
vidual who looked and acted like a common run-of-the-mill hood-
lum. However, his living accommodations at the hotel belied
this, as did the fact that Maheu learned Sam was under periodic
surveillance by the FBI. It was several weeks after his meeting
with Sam and Joe, who was identified to him as a courier operating
between Havana and Miami, that he saw photographs of both of
these individuals in the Sunday supplemental "Parade. ! They
were identified as Momo Salvatore Giancana and Santos Trafficant,
respectively. Both were on the list of the Attorney General's
ten most-wanted men. The former was described as the Chicago
chieftain of the Cosa Nostra and successor to Al Capone, and the
latter, the Cosa Nostra boss of Cuban Operations. Maheu called
this office immediately upon ascertaining this information.

9. In discussing the possible methods of accomplishing
this mission, Sam suggested that they not resort to firearms but,
if he could be furnished with some type of potent pill, that could

be placed in Castro's food or drink, it would be’a much more
effective operation. Sam indicated that he had a prospective
nominee in the person of Juan Orta, a Cuban official who had
been receiving kickback payments from the gambling interests,
who still had access to Castro and was ina financial bind.

 

10. Cornelius Roosevelt, Chief, TSD, was consulted and
assigned Dr. Raymond Triechler to develop a pill that had the
elements of rapid solubility, high lethal content, and little or
no traceability. Six of these items were produced and, after
keing checked out for their effectiveness by Dr.-Edward M.
Gunn, three pills were ultimately turned over to Sam for the

mission. Neither TSD nor Dr, Gunn was briefed on the ultimate
use of the pills.

11, Joe delivered the pills to Orta, After several weeks
of reported attempts, Orta apparently got cold feet and asked out
of the assignment. He suggested another candidate who made
several attempts without success.

12. Joe then indicated that Dr. Anthony Verona, one of the
principal officers in the Cuban Exile Junta, had become dis-
affected with the apparent ineffectual progress of the Junta and

: was willing to handle the mission through his own resources.

13. Dr, Verona was approached and Jumped at the oppor-
tunity of getting involved in an independent Operation, He was
‘ told that the private interests backing the project did not want
the U. S. Government and, particularly the CIA, to know of their
involvement, (So far as this Office knows, he has never divulged
his participation in the project to the Agency.)

14. He asked, asa prerequisite to the deal, that he be given
$10, 000 for Organizational expenses’and requested $1,000 worth
of communications equipment.

15. Dr. Verona's potential was never fully exploited, as
the project was canceled shortly after the Bay of Pigs episode.

Verona was advised that the offer was withdrawn, and the pills
were retrieved.
