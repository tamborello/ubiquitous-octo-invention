We did not locate new information responsive to your
request. We limited our search to the electronic files based
upon the fact that an extensive search of all DO holdings was
done just one year ago that covered the same topic and time
frame. Additionally, new information would have either been a
cable and automatically captured or we would have processed other
forms of information into the record system based upon the high

profile of this issue.
