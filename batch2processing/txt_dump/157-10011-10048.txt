had actually seen what this Meant, and frankly, there was an
innate fear that with the initial $17 million, then there would
be no way of stopping, I mean, he might go to Venezuela and

a matter of record, but they were not too favorable, that we
presented to the National Security Council verbally but not
in writing.

Mr. Madigan. Who made the presentation?

Senator Schweiker. What subsequently happened then with
the Security council denunciation, et cetera?

Mr. Madigan. The State Department denounced the agreement

and that same evening we were told that two Ree,

officials were on their way to Saudi Arabia.

@ a 1 am not too far off in what I am about to tell you. The contract

6 if their tankers became obsolete, they could only be replaced

8 Our statistics, after having studied the contract and

10 | that at the completion of approximately five-and-a-half years,
11 || Mr. Onassis would control more dead weight tonnage than the

13 | on the high seas annually more oil by tens of thousands of

17 after five-and-a-half years his annual profit would be in the
