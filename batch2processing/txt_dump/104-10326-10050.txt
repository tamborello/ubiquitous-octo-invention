6. DISRUPTION OF LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS:
GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO KEEP THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH US INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES SECRET. . IN THE CASE.OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THOSE
RELATIONSHIPS, ALL CONTACT COULD BE SEVERED IN THE EVENT OF
DISCLOSURE AND EMBARRASSMENT. SUCH A RUPTURE IN THE RELATIONSHIP
DEFIES EASY REPAIR. THE SOUTH KOREAN AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY
PLANNING, WHICH SERIOUSLY EMBARRASSED JAPANESE LIAISON WHEN IT
KIDNAPPED OPPOSITION POLITICIAN KIM DAE JUNG FROM TOKYO OVER TWO
DECADES AGO, IS STILL TREATED AS A PARIAH TODAY.

AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF US INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR PURSUIT. DISCLOSURE

INTELLIGENCE ON THE GROUP.
