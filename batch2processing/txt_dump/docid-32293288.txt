SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR., aka

: Re Tampa airtel 8-27-63 which suggested that it may
be more logical to designate Miami as office of origin for this
investigation.

Our investigation of La Cosa Nostra has generally
established that Trafficante is the leader of this criminal
Organization in the Tampa area. It is. desirable, therefore,
that the Tampa Office should utilize the investigation of ;
Trafficants as the initial phase in our attempt to penstrate
the membership and activities of this organization in the Tampa

_ Pield Division.

Re Tampa airtel advises that Tampa contemplates closer
over-all coverage of the subject's associates in an effort to
develop more detailed information concerning the criminal
organization in the Tampa area. You should:also take full

' advantage of every opportunity to develop live informants among
these associates and the groups which operate in the Tampa Office
area. Although Trafficante spends substantial amount of his time
in Miami, coverage of his travel between Tampa and Miami has not
yet produced detailed information on the mode of travel or the
aliases which he may use if he registers as a passenger en the
commercial air lines. Similarly the general purpose of his travel
would appear te be in connection with his hoodlum operations but
‘iavestigation has net yet established if some of this travel is

Airtel to Tampa
RE: SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR.

NOTE: ' Re airtel stated that coverage of Trafficante in Tampa

is maintained by TP 41-C, TP 50-C, TP 107-PC, TP 120 PC, TP 105-c*

and several neighborhood sources. Tampa advised that investigation
has established that the subject goes to Tampa at infrequent
intervals. Our over-all investigation has not yet clearly established
to any exact degree the amount of time spent by Trafficante in either
Tampa or Miami. We have not yet determined why he maintains his home .
in Tampa and specific reasons for the amount of travel to Miami. which
he performs. It does not appear logical at this point in the
investigation to change the office of origin from Tampa to Miami.

, ReBuairtel to Tampa and Miami 8/19/63.

The whereabouts and activities of! ‘subject are of the
utmost importance, yet the whereabouts of the subject does not
establish the crux of where subject obtains and how he gets his
finances... The reporting of his. activities has likewise not
produced financial income.

‘ Relative to subject’ s whereabouts and activities in
the Tampa area, the following is noted: os

: 1. TP 105-C* maintains coverage of subject and his
family at 3610 Ei Centro, St. Petersburg Beach, Fla., and such
coverage has established subject has not used such place for any
possible get together to discuss any personal problems.

2. “TP 120 PC has been able to maintain coverage of
activities at 2505 Bristol, Tampa, it being noted this covers
subject's comings to Tampa and the fact that he does not discuss
business at such residence nor congregate with any particular.
individuals there. . :
