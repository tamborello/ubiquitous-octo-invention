of the family. To further explore the possibility
of cpel fan be utilized for the benefit of Hoffa in
connection with the cases pending in Federal courts in
Nashville and Chicago, Verhelle indicated that he would soon
confer with an attorney who was not identified by name but
who was referred to as the “quarterback" of the team of more
than 30 attorneys who reportedly are working on these cases
- for Hoffa. Verhelle anticipat ter so conferring,
it would be determined whether might be able to
help Hoffa through efforts directed toward one or more members
' of a jury or toward the judge himself.

Verhelle allegedly favored trying to make an
"arrangement" with Judge Austin through[ | on the basis
| of being an “old friend", and it was Verhelle"s feeling that
‘if Judge Austin were to make some rather minor procedural
mistake that would cause a mistrial, such a “human error" on
the part of the judge would not destroy his career but would
‘be of great value to Hoffa. Verhelle indicated that in
return for such favors to Hoffa, “they't would be happy to
pay the persons responsible for the favors. Tentative
arra: mts were made for Verhelle to attempt to meet with
| Jin Chicago in the near future, to discuss the |
} possibility of a Pension Fund loan to purchase th
at 130 North Franklin and also the possibility of
being of assistance to Hoffa in regard to pending court cases.

_Verhelle also intimated that he has a number of bank
accounts in Switzerland and that he handles some of these
accounts for Hoffa.
