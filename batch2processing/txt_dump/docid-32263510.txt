Retrievable information contained in files of the
FBI indicates that this Bureau received information derived
from transcripts of tape recordings furnished by another
government agency which conducts intelligence type investi-
gations. The transcripts indicated that on September 28,
1963, and October 1, 1963, the voice of an individual
identifying himself as Lee Oswald was recorded by the other
_ government agency conducting intelligence type investigations.
Additionally, this government agency provided the FBI with
photographs of an individual who appeared to be an American;
these photographs being taken by said agency on October 1,

1963. SA

It is noted that the FBI never received the actual
tape recordings from which the transcripts. were derived, as
the tapes were erased by the other government agency providing

the transcripts. AW

; In response to Question 1 of referenced request,
retrievable information indicates that the photographs of the
individual who appeared to be an American were transported to
the FBI Division, Dallas, Texas, on November 23, 1963, by
SA Eldon D. Rudd (retired). Subsequently, on November 23;
1963, one photograph of this unknown individual was exhibited
to Marguerite Oswald, at Dallas, Texas, by SA Bardwell D.
Odum (retired) in an attempt to determine if the individual
was known to Mrs. Oswald as an associate of her son Lee Harvey
Oswald. Mrs. Oswald could not identify the photograph as
anyone she knew. Rd

It is specifically noted that a copy. of the photo-
graph exhibited to Marguerite Oswald was furnished to the
‘Warren Commission on February 11, 1964. Additionally, on
July 16, 1964, by letter addressed to the Honorable J. Lee
Rankin, the Warren Commission was furnished with affidavits
regarding the source of the photographs and displaying of
same to Mrs. Oswald. (U) ;

; In view of the fact that no tape recordings were
ever provided to the FBI, Questions 2 and 3 of referenced request
are moot and therefore are not being responded to. (U)
