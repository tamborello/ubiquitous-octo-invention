RE: UNKNOWN SUBJECTS; LOCAL 901, TEAMSTERS UNION

in the offices of Local 610 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees
Union, Santurce, Puerto Rico, during the early morning hours of
February 8, 1962 and important union records allegedly were
destroyed. ; ;

The above confidential source on February 14, 1962 advised
the San Juan Office that he had received information that the fire
at the office of Local 610, Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union,
was caused by the Teamsters Union, Local 901, with the purpose
of establishing the precedent of fires in union offices and in
this manner the Teamsters headed by FRANK CHAVEZ, Secretary-
Treasurer of Local 901, planned to burm their own offices located
at 800 Figueroa Street, Santurce, Puerto Rico, to prevent the
Teamsters records from being inspected by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

The same confidential source advised on April 10, 1962
that the reason the books and records of Local 901 never arrived
by mail at the headquarters of the IBT, Washington, D.C., was due
to the fact that they were burned by LUIS E, PAGAN, bookkeeper,
Local 901, and IEOPOLDO RAMOS DUCOS, Local 901, organizer, This
information was learned in conversation with LUIS E, PAGAN and

when PAGAN was jokingly told that he had been photographed in the

 

KL

act of burning the union's records, PAGAN stated that this was
impossible as pictures cannot be taken at night.

The source stated at this time that he would attempt to
determine additional details as to the place and exact date the
records of Local 901 were burned, in addition to the identity of any
other individual who might have knowledge of the burning of the
above records. Source further stated that the records were burned
at the instructions of FRANK CHAVEZ and apparently after the
Federal Grand Jury, San Juan, had issued a subpoena for same.

The same source was recontacted periodically thereafter
and on May 29, 1962 advised that he had been unable to develop
any information as to the date or exact place where the records
of Local 901 were burned or the identities of other individuals
who might have first hand knowledge of same. —
