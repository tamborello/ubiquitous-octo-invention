As we see it, Garrison has
now reached the ultimate point
in the logic of his public state-
ments on the case since the
Playboy article, It's no longer
a matter of CIA having been un-
witting and then covering up for
agents or ex-agents, It's now
a matter of the conscious plan-
ning and carrying out of the
assassination, This is by and
large the Moscow line put out
through R, Palme Dutt--a long-
standing Soviet stalking horse--
in the U,K., Labour Review,
January 1964, The theme was
later picked up by Joachim

_Joesten and other sources.

The cables are self-
explanatory about the Dutchman
involved, The file entries we
hold.on him here just add more
detail to the unsavory portrait,
