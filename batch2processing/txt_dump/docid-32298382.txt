- Re; SECRET ORGANIZATION OF CONTINENTAL ACTION (osac)”

  
   

. Soa septesber Ww, 1984, MM To4 fa representative] :
of another government agency which conducts intelligence O
investigations, advised that the DRE in the Dominican |
Republic is operating a location about 100 miles from _

- where the Spanish ship was attacked. However, at this .-. oe

time, there is insufficient evidence to determine hey iso 0
os responsible for. the attack of the Spanish ship. (%)

 

we & T ~Fladvised that the MRR has been cperatinhy
: “against the South coast of Cuba and that an operation i
the Bahamas would be too far for the MRR's PT boats (X} mM)

ae Ba ‘t-Heontinued that there is speculation cath dg |
_ the Cuban government may have been responsible for the
attack to bring pressure on the Dominican Republic to review
its position in allowing Cuban exiles to operate out of |
that country. MM Te4 continued that it is also interesting
to note that the three persons killed on the Spanish vessel
were the top echelon of officers - the Captain, Second Mate .
'.-and Third Engineer - and of the persons wounded_were the Chief
Engineer, Second Engineer and Radio Operator. T-4¥ stated <]
there is some speculation that because the officers of the sh -P :
suffered so many casualities theye. may have been an internal .
‘problem with the ship's crew) fm) ; ;

 

 

on September 17, 1964, ‘MM T-5, a Cuban National who | -
has been involved in Cuban Revolutionary activities . for \
_. the past seven years, said that Juan Mesa Rodeiguez, head of
Secret Organization of Continental. Action, on September 16,
“1964, claimed his organization was responsible for the attack
against this Spanish ship and that the attacking boats: left

. ~ from ‘Florida (t/a)
a MM T-5 advised there was no evidence to support this
-claim, however, Mesa has been interested in attempting such an
