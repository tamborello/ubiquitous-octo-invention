Re: — Request for Additional Information and Records No. CIA-15
(Documents in Win Scott's Files Identified from Russ Holmes Files)

 

Dear John:

During our continuing review of the Russ Holmes files, we have come across a record,
which apparently was provided to the HSCA, that identifies a list of certain documents
containing “information relating to Kennedy assassination from Win Scott's personal 2—-

files.” We are attaching a copy of the record for your reference. We have been unable

to locate the following documents recorded on the list:

 

~ HMMA 22668, 2 January 1964
- Reel 67-REP-155, 21 December 1963
- Memo for Record from David Phillips dated 5 August 1963;
Subject: Termination of Publication of Respuesta
- Mexico City 4409, dated 2 May 1963
- Memo for File from Scott; Subject: Amb. Mann, dated 8 November 1962

We request that you search for these documents and provide copies to the Review
Board. We would appreciate your response by February 26, 1997. If this does not
provide you with sufficient time, please let us know, in writing, by what date you
believe you will be able to respond to this request.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
