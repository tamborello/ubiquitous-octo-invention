FOR THE RECORD

By Brig. Gen. LansdaleS{_

Subject: Outline of Covert Operations

Last night, Deputy Secretary Gilpatric asked me to give hima
brief outline, by this morning, of Operation Mongoose in the light
of current US-USSR negotiations re Cuba. I was to cover present
status of operations, resources, and sketch in future possibilities.
I wrote the outline, based on current reports from the Mongoose
operations team and my staff. Only two copies were typed.

I showed the outline to Mr. Gilpatric this morning as he rode
out to the airport, to catch his flight to New York. I noted the
exceptional sensitivity of the information in the outline. He acknowl-
edged its sensitivity, said the outline was precisely what he had in
mind, and that I should hold the paper rather than his taking it. He
then asked me to show it to Secretary McNamara and to the Attorney

General. I did so, today.

 

The outline was read by Mr. Frank Hand, M ;
and by Lt-Col Patchell. I gave its general information to General
#i.said that the figures were the same he had given
me, for CIA operations; he noted that CLA intelligence reporting
was spotty now, due to lack of mail deliveries from Cuba.
