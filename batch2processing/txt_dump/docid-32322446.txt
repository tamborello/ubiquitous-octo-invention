in San Antonio files pertaining to all of the names listed in the
reference communication with the exception of Lee Harvey Oswald.

Two references to the name Lee Harvey Oswald were
located. SA 62-0-19184 is missing and it appears that this
document, which was indexed on 05/21/1987, has been destroyed
during routine file destruction procedures. The other reference,
SA 89-0-314, enclosed, is an airtel from Houston to Dallas,
05/14/1992, captioned “Lee Harvey Oswald, aka; Assassination of
John F. Kennedy, November 22, 1963, Dallas, Texas; AFO.”

San Antonio also conducted a search of all SAC material
stored in this office without locating any documents pertaining
to the President Kennedy assassination.

Due to the unavailability of the IIS Analyst, deadline
of 06/12/1998 was missed. On 06/09/1998 Carol Keeley was advised
that this deadline would be missed and she stated that it would
be sufficient to respond as soon as possible after the IIS
Analyst returned. :
