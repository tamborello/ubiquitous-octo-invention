In August 1974 HEMMING was approached by Arniande BOLET,
a Cuban veteran of the 2506 Brigade whom HEMMING had worked
with in anti-Castro activities, and by John VARESE (nfi),
to help them:organize and run air smuggling operations for
‘\\ Phomas and*William O'DONNEL. The O'DONNEL prothers, using
““the cover of their construction firm in the Ft. Lauderdale
area; (AMERICAN EASTERN DEVELOPMENT) were involved in maritime
smuggling of marijuana from Colombia to Florida. During an
unspecified four years (probably 1970-74) the O'DONNEL's had
averaged approximately six-seven loads of marijuana per year
at. three-four tons for each loads smuggled into Florida.
Of these. 24-28 loads of marijuana they had to jettison into
the sea only five Joads for security reasons. The rest of the
loads had been successfully delivered into Florida. :
. the source of the marijuana in Colombia is Dr. Arturo
ROMANO-Fedullo of Barranquilla, Colombia. Besides.running the
smuggling for ROMANO, William O'DONNEL handles the laundering
of the money accumulated by drug trafficking through banks
in.Grand Cayman, Switzerland, and Curacao. oa
Armando BOLET convinced the O'DONNEL's that they should
- add’ air smuggling to their narcotic trafficking methods and
that they shold: also try cocaine in.addition to- marijuana. . :
BOLET told the O'DONNEL's ‘that there were many experienced --
men available in Florida who could be used to smuggle drugs . .
into Florida by aiz. HOLET was especially interested in cargo
parachute drops and parachute jumps by individuals carrying
: loads of cocaine. BOLET recruited HEMMING to help organize
; these activities. A common technique-used by BOLET and HEMMING
: ‘ was’to fly an aireraft into Florida legally, but to have a
parachutist jump onto-.a pre-selected drop zone. in southern
