. RETURN TO CIA
THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE Do Not Reproduce”
@

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505

Office of Legislative Counsel

19 March 1979
Mr. G. Robert Blakey

Chief Counsel and Director

Select Committee on Assassinations
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Bob:
Herewith are comments on the Nosenko draft.

In commencing, it should bel noted that Tennent Bagley remains -
under cover, retired abroad. We are obliged to honor that cover,
which he has not moved to have modified. To expose his true
status as a former CIA employee could have repercussions in his
present situation that we must accept as significant. When he
was here in November 1978, he was advised of steps necessary
to remove his cover, in the event he decided to go overt in this
matter; he took no steps to alter his cover status. It remains
classified. We therefore request that the example set in the
Hart testimony, of referring to Mr. Bagley by the title of Deputy
Chief, SB Division, be followed in this draft.

Following are detailed comments:

 

NOSENKO

Testimony of Nosenko

 

Circled Page 3, lines 14 and 17, depending on how one counts. ‘—~
KGB agents should read. KGB officers.

Circled Page 4, lines 3 through 20. Suggest the following “-~
rewrite:

There were two factors, however, that limited the value
of the information supplied to the Committee by these
ex-KGB officers: 1) neither had been assigned to the
same KGB Directorate as Nosenko, and 2) one of them had
information about the KGB that was outdated.

Circled Page 6. Nosenko's actual testimony, last response. Suggest __~
changing word "defectionist" to "defector."

Page 6, line 6. Delete “woman in Utah" and insert “individual." ©

Page 6, lines 20 and 21. Delete “and even was a co-op from CIA." °~

October 1967. Otherwise it may appear that Mr. Fithian was referring
to the years 1964-69. :

I understand from your conversation with Rodger that you would
welcome a letter from the Agency, on this section of the report,
for inclusion with it in the final report. Could we have more
details?

It is understood that this is the last paper we will see that has
not already been reviewed. As you know, we are ready to follow-up
in a meeting with you on the substantive comments already provided
you. .

Very truly yours,
