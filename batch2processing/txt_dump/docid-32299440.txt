immediate future. BOSCH claimed DUQUE has neither the
money nor equipment necessary for such operations, although
he is attempting to raise funds for the purchase of arms

BOSCH mentioned that just three or four days

of Dade County, BOSCH said that in view of this he did
not believe DUQUE was preparing to make an attack against co
