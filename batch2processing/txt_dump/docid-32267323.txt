Memo 3/27/68 from CICP (signed L. H. Turman)

Adjustment: Regarding subject's request for issuance

of form I-512 8/9/65 following submission of what
appeared to be a fabricated letter to support application
for lifting Notice of Prevention of Departure served
6/19/63. Case should be referred to Travel Control.
Reports prior to issuance of Notice reflect participation
in abortive raids on Cuba and militant activity in

other groups which contravened U.S. policy.

CICP contains reports 1-4/65 which associated the subject
and a number of other Cuban exiles with activist group
reported to be involved in abortive plan to overthrow

the government of Guatemala. Although the subject may

be characterized as a militant opportunist who would
likely engage in activity inimical to U.S. policy,

there appears to be no basis upon which to deny his
application for adjustment of status.

Memo for file 8/9/65 from R. Neptune, II
Subject interviewed 8/9/65 at which time he was
unable to identify company for. which he was supposed
to be going on business abroad. Stated that at
present not working for this company, but would travel
to Costa Rica, Panama and Spain to establish new
system of crecit and collections. If the system
could not be adopted he would return to the U.S. He stated
his desire to avail himself of the opportunity to study
accounting at the University of Costa Rica, San Jose.

Handwritten note: Mike- This looks like a fabricated
letter and I think we should deny without going
back to Snyder.

8/11/65 Contacted Jerry Snyder re application 1512
and he suggests we deny request.
