JOSEPH MASSEI (Miami file 92-122) has been at the
Arlington Hotel, Hot Springs, Arkansas, since 10/1/62.
His office at Miami Beach is closed in his absence.

MM 609-C on 10/11/62, advised as a result of an
FBI inquiry at a printer in Miami, relative to football
parlay cards, HARRY YATES (Miami file 165-26) at present has
no cards. On 10/18/62, this source advised the bookmakers are
puzzled as to why the FBI is interested in the football
parlay cards, since they are printed locally. He stated as
a result of the FBI inquiry the runners who distribute these
cards find the cards harder to secure, even though there are

 

still readily available cards in this area.

MM 509-C on 10/10/62, advised that on 10/6/62 and
10/9/62, HYMAN MARTIN was driven to and from the Patio j
Bridge Club, Miami Beach, by JERRY FISHMAN (16643). While \
there MARTIN played bridge with IZZY BECK, MANNY BERMAN,
and MAX MILLER. FISHMAN played the card game called
"Million" with JIMMY COPPOLA at $25.00 a game. ft

This source said also that SOL EDER , brother of
MAX EDER (Miami file 92-467) and AL DEUTSCH, a bookmaker and
gambler, have acquired the coctail lounge in the Cadillac
Hotel, Miami Beach, and intend to use same for a bookmaking
and shylocking operation. MAX EDER, he learned, supplied
the funds for SOL EDER.

In addition, this surce related he was told that
a New York group interested in gambling and bookmaking
control the distribution of football parlay cards in the -
ibanitarea and the New York representative is_JOSEPH hd
Zg& INDELICATO, who receives a. percentage of the action on “
“thé cards\~atthough he neither handles or has anything ‘to ;
2 do with the actual distribution of same. ’
