on 8/1964, BYRON, CAMERON was interviewed at Fr.

BYRON RIGGS CAMERON was born Elizabeth, N. J.,
5/22/16; he is maxried and has two children, ages 23 and

17. He is President of Caribe Trading Co., Ltd.; H. F.
JENNE is Secretary-Treasurer, and interview of JENNE already
xéported to Bureau. - ae

CAMERON denied any knowledge of any plot to assassi-
nate FIDEL CASTRO or any, other government leaders of Cuba;
- stated all of his warenousemen and. Longshoremen ave Cuban, all

are suffering because of FIDEL CASTRO and consequently all ave
vehemently anti-CASTRO, and he is never around them without

some of them mentioning how much better the world would be if
someone would kill FIDEL CASTRO and his brother, RAUL CAST?O.

  

He denied knowing anyone in the Mafia or "Cosa

_ Rostra;" he said he could not understand why BABUN would nave

_to approach JOSE "PEPIN" BOSCH, JULIO LOBO or anyone else to
raise one hundred or one hundred fifty thousand dollars; that
in his opinion, this would be “chicken feed to BABUN, who could
raise a million" in twenty four hours if he needed it.
