9 June 1978

NOTE FOR: §S. D. Breckinridge \~
FROM : Rodger S. Gabrielson
SUBJECT : Conversation with Harold Leap, HSCA Staff

1. Hal stopped by our office to turn in his summary

file notes on the Japan connection. to me that he
has completed his interviews of all people and
that he will conclude that there is no credible evidence

linking Oswald to a CIA operational connection in Japan.

 

2. Hal then talked about the trip to Mexico City.
He indicated that on Sunday they had travelled to the
residence of the former DCOS for an interview which was
arranged for the current COS. He said the team was very
disappointed in the DDCI's decision to deny direct access to
Durant, particularly since some of the individuals they had
interviewed indicated that the Station had passed to the
Mexican Liaison Service certain "take" from the surveillance
operations. He did not specify whether this meant audio or
photo ops. He left me with the impression that the Committee
would continue to press for access to Durant.
