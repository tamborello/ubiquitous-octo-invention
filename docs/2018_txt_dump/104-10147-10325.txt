with Steve Fallis, House Select Committee on Assassinations staff,
to advise him that we were nol ins poste} providewscces Te aKy”
files on the part of uncleared Select. Comimittee personnel until such
time as clearances were obtained and appropriate secrecy agreements
were executed... At this point, Richard Sprague, Counsel of the Committee,
came on the phone and referred to the fact that Mr. Knoche had made

    

an exception in granting access to classified material regarding the

tapes of Lee Harvey Oswald's communications with the Soviet Embassy

‘in Mexico City and he wondered if similar arrangements could be

made in this case, I told Sprague I would look into it and be back in -
touch with him.

Dorothy Fosdick, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senate
Government Operations Committee staff, requesting access to a study
mentioned in the Henry Bradshir article in the press today entitled,
"U.S. Hard Currency and Payments in 1977-1978."' I made arrangements
for the document to be delivered to Ms. Fosdick this morning.
