SUBJECT 2 Basic Proposal to Cover Field Assessment
of Potential REDSKIN Agent Candidates

1. A meeting was held 1 February 1961, to discuss the
feasability of conducting field assessment of potential REDSKIN
agent candidates by staf? psychologists of the Assessment and
Evaluation Staff, OTR, under suitable cover. |
Conferees were Messeurs Thomas Strange and pf € a '
Cover Group, John Gittinger of TSD, Dr‘ er. John |
Golder of the A&E Staff, OTR, and Fielder Dudley of 38/10. ‘The
problem discussed in para 2 below was recognized and tentative
agreement reached on the basic proposal discussed in para 3
below. . co.

2. Heretofore field assessments have been conducted by-
SR/10 case officers whose capabilities in the rather esoteric
science of psychological assessment are, at best, baged funda- i
mentally on intuition and subject to variable degrees. of objec-
tivity. Furthermore these case officers reveal their Agency.
connection on initial contact supported by credentials _in alias.
This all agent candidates screened in the field become aware of——
Agency interest _to exploit legal travel to the ussa for intelligence

purposes, These include a considerable percentage who are acreensed |

Headquarters assessment, .
3. The Probles:

a. To sereen out unsuitable REDSZIN agent candidates
without revealing Agency interest and to reduce possibilities
of irrational reaction, i.e., going to the Press or writing’ i
letters to the President when later approached by an Agency |
representative proposing 2a intelligence mission. |
