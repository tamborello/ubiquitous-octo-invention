. Pardon the form of this communication, but it
Should get to you this morning early.

Protéising negotiations on the Proenza and Mexico
history came apart yesterday evewing when Blakey came
back on the scene’ We seemed to be on the verge of
agreeing that they would accept a five months period
from the Proenza 201 file (not the ops file) and
sanitized sections of the Nexico history, limited to
Blakey and Cornwell only. No junior or other ESCA
staffers. We viewed this as showing that the papers
had nothing to do With the HSCA charter, while showing
good faith at the same time.

Blakex arguesgthat he must see the entire Mexico
City history (som 20]years worth) to understand the
Station, which he Intends to try to evaluate. He also
plans to go to Havana again, where he plans to inter-
view Proanza, and wants to know everything about her,
etce, in prevaration for his Meeting With her. We
continue to Prel it hasn't anything to do with the
real HSCA charter.

Blakey made it clear that if he sees it he will |
want staff members Also to see it, the likely
candidates being highly unacceptable for their remark |
able immaturity. |

!

Stokes is out of town, but Blakey says he can get |
in touch with him, If we have to go throfgh Blakey = |
Stokes! answer doubtleas will be "zive.™

de Seem to have run this course, and now have i
the threat of supbeena hancng over us, I propose an .
early meeting: Acting DDO (perhaps with Chiefs LA Div
isbn and Ca Staff), General Counsel, Lezislative Covnse

and Mae
