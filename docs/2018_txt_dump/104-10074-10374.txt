Maurice. HALPERIN - Professor, SEU

. Lo ” HALPERIN was born on 3. March 1906 | at Boston, Massachusetts
and entered Canada in the spring of 1968. In late 1953 he left the
United States for Mexico in order to avoid testifying before a

. United States Senate internal sub-committee. In 1958, when the
Mexican Government began deporting United States Communists,

. HALPidIN went to the Soviet Union, and became a visiting professor
at the U.5.5.n. Academy of Sciences. He went to Cuba in October

. ly62 as a professor of Economy at the University of Havana, where
he remained employed until coming to Canada. He is currently .
employed with the Faculty of Education, Behavioural Science
Foundation, at Simon Fraser University. As noted above, Laughlin.
‘Bernard CURHIE lobbied very hard to have HALPERIN accepted by.

- Simon Fraser University. CURRIE was aware of HALPERIN's background
and "watered it down" to get him the appointment. Oo ae

a ofr particular interest. in this case is the fact that

' CURRIE and HALPERIN were associated with the same espionage group
in the United States. His application for landed status was the
subject of an objection by the ACMP and, as yet, no final decision
nas been made by tne Minister of Innigrat ion.

; EPSTEIN, who has been active in student power activities at

of the SDU at SFU, consists of left-wing activists? in this
category. Martin LONEY, who was one of the student leaders

during the SFU incident, entered Canada as a British citizen in
August 1966. Dr. Thomas Burton BOTTOMORE , &@ leading Marxist
and author on Marxism as well as a British citizen, took up --
employment at SFU in 1965 as head of the Department of Political
Science, Sociology and Anthropology (PSA). BOTTOMORE, as head of.
the PSA, was responsible for the hiring of Kathleen ABERLE, a
British eitizen, and of Thomas Harold BROSE, John William Carl = —~
LEGGEIT, Nathan POPKIN and Martin NICOLAUS, all U.S. citisens.

~ Although the largest concentration of foreign radicals
at SFU was in the PSA, other activists did take positions in -
other departments.l fhese included Sidney COONTZ, Michael Allan
LEBOWITZ, Paul Edward IVORY, and Maurice HALPERIN, all U.S. .
citizens, and Laughlin Bernard CURRIE, a citisen of Colombia. ~~ =~:

. Mordecai BRIEMBERG, who took over as head of the PSA
Department after BOTTOMORE tendered his resignation in 1967, has
expressed a desire to remain as Department head in order to keep wo
his hand in on the hiring. In this regard, Gerald SPERLING is, *
through BRIEMBERG, making efforts to get Malcolm SYLVERS, an American
Marxist university professor who apparently worked for the Communist
underground in Italy during the early 1960's, into SFU.
