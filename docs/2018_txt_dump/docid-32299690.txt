point.. Massi advised Italian Police he has not seen nor heard
of Annaloro since that date. Italian Police reported they also
interviewed Massi's wife, Laura, his children, Concetta and Gen-
naro, and his brother, Umberto Massi, all of whom confirmed what
Pat Massi said. G+ Mu) .

Noticing the reticence of Massi and members of :
his family to discuss Annaloro, Italian Police subjected Pat Massi
to further intensive interrogation in an effort to establish
Annaloro's location in Italy.(@7) ut)

Massi still denied knowledge of subject's location
but did admit that Damiano Cumella, born Villalba, Caltanisetta,
November 25, 1897, and Calogero Sinatra, born Vallelunga, Sicily,
January 31, 1914, were also at the baptismal ceremony. He also
admitted that on November 4, 1963, a Gingi Salvatore (later iden-
tified as James M. Salvatore, born Pennsylvania, September 20,
1916, U. S. passport D614511 issued July 31, 1963) arrived in :
Mosciano St. Angelo from the United States. He claimed Salvatore |
travelled by air from the States and wanted to negotiate the
purchase of a hotel which Massi owns in the United States. He
Stated he was a very good friend of Salvatore and about ten years
ago was godfather to his child, Gina. He said Salvatore remained
at the Hotel Riviera until November 7, 1963, and on that same day
Massi, his brother, Umberto, and Salvatore drove to Rome where they
took lodging at the Hotel Parioli. On November 8, 1963, Massi
claims he returned to Mosciano St. Angelo and Salvatore told him
he was returning to the U. S. According to Italian Police, Massi |

is still residing in Mosciano St, Angelo. (G@7Yu)

Rome letter 11/15/63 reported information from
Italian Police that Massi had sold his apartment at Viale Provincie 116
to Damiano Cumella, Annaloro's uncle. Sgt. Giovanni Mastroianni, i
Investigative Squad, Italian Carabinieri, Rome, advised that
Damiano Cumella approached an attorney named Riccardo Miliani, ~—
Via P. A. Micheli, 90, Rome, to rent an apartment for six months. |
Miliani advised Cumella was alone and when shown a photograph of |
Annalero could not identify the photograph. @-1 Yin)

Rome 92-68

Rome cable dated 11/12/63 reported information
received from JAMES J. WAGNER, Immigration and Naturalization
(INS) representative in Rome, who was in Genoa, Italy, on a
road trip. WAGNER stated a fairly reliable source informed
him on 11/12/63 that- BRUNO met JOE ADONIS in Milan, Italy,
about three to five days previous and might be either in
Milan or Venice, Tealy. ¢furnisneg with this informatien,
Doctor MANOPULO requested a surveillance on ADONIS in Milan
and realerted police authorities in Venice regarding BRUNO'S
possible presence there. Doctor MANOPULO said to date no
information has been received indicating BRUNO is in these

cities. ¥Z41¥u)

Doctor MANOPULO has requested Italian police in
Sicily to locate and interview CUMELLA and CALOGERO SINATRA,
BRUNO'S uncle and cousin, in an effort to determine BRUNO'S
current location. Yu)

Kas the Bureau has been informed, Italian police
interviewed PAJ MASSI who stated BRUNO departed for the U. S.
on 11/10/63 .% ubsequent investigation has failed to verify
BRUNO'S departure from Italy and, accordingly, Legat is
proceeding on the assumption that BRUNO is still in Italy.

We are continuing to press this matter vigorously. All

Upon the receipt of any pertinent information concerning

BRUNO'S current location, Bureau will be advised by expeditious

means.

Rome 92-68

For the Bureau's information, Italian authorities
do not record the arrival of an individual nor do they have
a record of the individual's departure from Italy, This
practice was abolished about eighteen months.ago. The
Italian Government does, however, require all foreigners to
exhibit their passports when they take lodging at a hotel,
rooming house, or pensione. Pertinent information is ex-
tracted and. forwarded to the Foreigners Office in Rome, Italy. @)(u)

In the case of ANNALORO, special precautions have
been taken to flag his departure from Italy. Pertinent data.
concerning subject has been furnished to all sea ports and
airports, and should subject attempt to leave Italy, this
office has arranged to be advised by expeditious means. As,
the Bureau is aware, the Rome Office has not received any ~*~
information from Italian police which would indicate ANNALORO . !
has taken lodging at a public place in Italy since October,
1963. It can be assumed, therefore, that if subject in fact.”
is in Italy, he is lodging at a private residence with
friends possibly under an assumed name. GN)

 

Come Rome Office, through the Central Bureau,
Criminal Division, Italian National Police, Rome, has alerted !
all police districts to be on the lookout for subject and, \
in addition, airports at Fiumicino, Rome, and Malpensa, Milan, |
and sea ports in Naples and Genoa have also been alerted '
regarding subject. It would seem logical, therefore, that
should the Rome Office receive information that subject is

_ at a departure point in Italy about to depart for the U. S.,;

we should. permit him to depart for the U. S. where he can be
arrested on arrival rather than taking the circuitous route of
having Italian police detain him in order that a representa-
tive of the U. S, Embassy, Rome, can limithis passport for wt
direct and immediate return to the U. S.J ;In this connection, i
as was set forth in Rome cable of 11/1/63, Doctor ARISTIDE |
MANOPULO, Central Bureau, Criminal Division, Italian National ~ |
Police, Rome, has informed this office that should ANNALORO'S :
passport be limited for return to the U, S, only, he can re-
fuse to leave Italy and the Italian Government cannot compel
him to leave as this would be extradition in disguise. @-1 Vu)
