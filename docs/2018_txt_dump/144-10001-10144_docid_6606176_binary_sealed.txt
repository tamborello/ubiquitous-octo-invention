1. On 8 November, Ed Sapp visited Mr. Robert G. Blakey, {
Chief Counsel and Staff Director for the House Select Committee i
on Assassinations, to receive questions concerning a former i
Air Force enlisted man's allegation that he had intercepted |
information linking an assassination plot against President Kennedy |
with a figure in organized crime. Mr. Blakey had been referred to i
NSA (GC, Dan Silver) by Ms. Judy.Miller, Special Assistant to |
John Kester, OSD. - !

2. Mr. Blakey indicated that David F.- Christensen had : !
communicated with a friend of his named Sgt Michael B. Stevensen '
at "Corry" Field, FLorida. Mr. Christensen has been committed to ‘
a mental institution due, he asserts, to pressures arising from :
an incident occurring in 1963. i

3. At that time, Christensen was in the Air Force assigned 44USC2107(5)(g)(2)(D)
to Kirknewton, Scotland. Sometime before November,.1963, in his

  

work as an interceptor of cormunications, i
he intercepted the communications referred in paragraph 1. Mr. Blakey ;
stated that he did not know who the crime figure is. Christensen's -* i
supervisor, Sgt Praeter (actually "Prater") refused to send this

traffic to NSA and this, he alleges, eventually caused him to have
a mental breakdown. ; Hl

4. Mr. Blakey stated that NSA had already acknowledged the
existence of such a facility during this period, but he didn't
indicate to whom such a statement had been made.

5. Mr. Blakey posed the following questions for NSA:

(a) What is NSA's capability for retrieving communications
from this time and place?

‘(b) How quickly can we make this retrieval?

(His Committee completes its work in December. If

NSA can easily provide the answers to a number of
questions, he will do some preliminary. investigation :
before formally requesting the information, but if i
-~ we indicate that much time will be required, he will 7
task us now,) ; : . i
(c) What additional information does NSA need. from Mr. i
Blakey to speed the retrieval process? . q ; ;

(d) Is the data still available for retrieval?
