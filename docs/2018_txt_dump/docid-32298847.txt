y
. He stated that approximately three weeks pre-
vious, two men known to him only as SCOTTY STEVENSON
(phonetic) and BILL-ROBERTSON (phonetic),: had talked to
him at great length concerning his past: background. He
stated that ROBERTSON was allegedly a local bondsman, and.
that SCOTTY stated that ‘he was a local parole and probation
officer. Since that- time, CI has learned. that :-these’itwo
men are working hand-and-hand' with West Side hoodlums,
"CHUCKIE" NICOLETTI, "JU JU" GRIECO, TONY SPILATRO and |
WILLIE "POTATOES" DADDANO. “These men meet practically
‘every. evening from about 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. in the
Garden Lounge..in the Bismark Hotel. . Ly

Since the original meeting. with: STEVENSON : ‘and.
ROBERTSON, they have squnded - out CI concerning his willing-

ness’to work for. them,’ type of work not stated during first .

part of their: conversation; However, .on November 7,. 1960,
CI met. these men, and arrangements were .made ‘for. ‘him, to.
work for them on Monday evenings, which is the one night a
week that CI has off. The nature of his duties. was: more:
fully explained tochim.at this time. It. seems that there
are certain "pick-ups". that CI must make and that :for. his
efforts, he will be paid a "C-Note" | every Monday evening. |
It is “known to CI that. these men are involved ‘in bookie,
operations on.the, West ‘Side and Forest Park, Illinois. VQ

It is. also known to CI that ROBERTSON: and STEVENSON are
very strongly associated with the top: hoodlum échelon: of

‘Organized crime on the West Side of Chicago. . CI:.pointed

out that during. the various conversations with these: men,
they have gone to. great lengths to determine his background
and his associates while he. lived in the Southern: part of
Illinois, some years ago. When they;determined that’ he

had been closely associated with a leading Danville bookie
by the name of WARREN WHITE, that seemed to certify him in
their eyes as one they could trust. CI explained that
WARREN WHITE has: recently completed serving a sentence in

the Federal Penitentiary. -in Terre Haute, Indiana, for income

tax evasion. \\

In their most recent contact with CI, these
men appeared to trust him 100% and while they ‘have not
told him specifically what type of "pick-ups" he is to .
make, he’ assumes that for the most part,.it will. be money
owed the "syndicate" on the West Side. He feels that. they
believe that he is better qualified. to handle some of their”
contacts than the men listed above. He pointed out for ©
example, that TONY SPILATRO is a young "punk" who is trigger

- happy, impulsive, and therefore, not suited for certain

types of operations. in which these men are. involved. We

CI. stated that the following ‘Monday ,- Novenber™ 14,

-1960, he is to meet these.men at Gus" Steak House. of Cicero,

located at 4817 Roosevelt Road in Cicero, Illinois. He. .
pointed out that this steak house is. owned by..SAM. "MOONEY"
GIANCANA, and that it is run by a fellow. known .to. him only
as. "ROCKY", ‘He: stated that in the past, he has been invited
on several occasions to their-upstairs gambling den and has
seen many prominent West Side hoodlums partaking of the
pleasures afforded them in this place. a :

During the above conversation with these men,
CI was asked what’ bookie he used, as well. as other employees
of Topper's ‘Restaurant, where he is manager. He stated that
he used a bookie naned GOLD, and they admonished ‘him for.
using the bookie out. of the ir territory, and suggested .
strongly that he make full use of their service in the. future
as well as the other employees at Topper's:. CI: was..given
permission by these men to personally take bets for their
group in the future up -to the amount. of: $5,000.00. 0.

Another feature of this. conversation is the fact that

-GYANCANA flew in to Chicago from San Francisco on 11/5/60, and

MOE DALITZ, who has connections with the Stardust and Desert Inn
Hotels in Las Vegas, also came into town over the week end of
11/5/60, Purpose of these two individuals appearing then could be

‘adjudication over the above-described situation, It could also

apply. to the situation wherein MARSHALL CAIFANO embarrassed
certain people in Las Vegas.

MOE and MOONEY, mentioned in the above conversation,
are one in the same; namely, SAMUEL GIANCANA,

“Approximately a week before this conversation took place,
MARSHALL CAIFANO was in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the Desert Inn
Hotel.and was ordered: to leave Las Vegas by local authorities
and he. refused to.do so, During his stay in Las Vegas, CAIFANO
was the subject. of. much controversy and became involved in a fist
fight. with a reporter for the "Las Vegas Sun", CAIFANO left
Las Vegas, Nevada, on 10/30/60. AN

SU:4432-C advised that Major RIDDLE, President of the
Dunes. Hotel, Las Vegas; JACK ENTRATTER, President of the Sands
Hotel, Las Vegas; MILTON PRELL, President of the Sahara Hotel,
Las Vegas; and other Las Vegas Hotel. owners and executives, were
extremely upset over the recent activities of MORRIS DALITZ and
his’ associates in their efforts to take over the Riviera Hotel

.in Las. Vegas, in defiance of the Nevada Gaming Control Board,

These persons feel that this is bringing unnecessary pressure
on all of the "Strip" hotels and will undoubtedly result in
additional restrictive legislation, According to .8U 432-C,
these hotel owners also blame the Desert Inn group for the raids

on the casinos by the Gaming Control Board, which has been carried

out in.all of the hotels visited by MARSHALL CAIFANO, mentioned
above, \W :
Standard Garbage Disposal Company

River Road Motel
5400 River Road

Rosemont, Illinois

On 9/12/60, MURRAY HUMPHREYS, GUS ALEX and an unknown
individual had a conversation on that date, according to
- CG 6343-C*, which is as follows: \;\

ALEX: MOE ain’t gonna call me until 12:00, I1'11 lay
you. two to one he forgets to call, I told hin
I'd wait until 12:15,

. HUMPHREYS: | . What did I want to talk to MOE about? Oh yeah,
When you go out, he's got that, his brothers
are in that motel up north and they've got
their own laundries up there. They found out

: .it was too costly, it's being torn and every=

1 thing. They reached out for a linen company,

: anyhow, the Greek told MORRIE GORDON that he'd
try to get the stop. Ask him to tell his
brother to interview MORRIE, that's all, MORRIE
wants an appointment with his brother, They're
reaching out. I have to get for NANCY, ... his
boy are in the army. I know NANCY's brothers

‘are in the army ...

. The motel referred to by HUMPHREYS "up north" is the
River Road Motel, which is allegedly owned by GIANCANA and managed
by CHARLES GIANCANA, brother of SAMUEL GIANCANA, Apparently
this motel has been operating their own laundry service and were
desirous of obtaining the services of the Superior Towel and
Linen Company, which is owned by MORRIE GORDON, an associate
of MURRAY HUMPHREYS,
