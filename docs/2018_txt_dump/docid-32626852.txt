as To destroy the Katanga eir force in the air and on the ground.
d. To interdict the established routes of coumunicatdon into
" Elisabethvils .

@. To provide limited air cover for the movement of UN forces.

2. If the situation. showla deteriorate to the degree that the
accomplishment of the UN objectives is in jeopardy, additional force
build-up could be accomplished inerementally up to the scale contemplated
in CINCLANT contingency plans. This might include an airborne task force
of two battle groups, portion of a Marine Division/Wing Team, a carrier
task force, two tactical fighter squadrons, and a composite reconnaissance
squadron with an additional Army division end the remainder of the Marine
Division/Wing Team on call.

Logistic Support

1. Support for the forces proposed for deployment will be provided
by air lines of communication from CONUS.

2. The major ‘Logistic requirement for support of the forces is FOL.
Direct ground refueling of eight P-100 aireraft flying two sorties per
day can be accomplished by four KC-135 tanker aircraft shuttling between
Leopolaville and Kamina. Alternatively, ten C-12h sorties daily carrying
POL in drums fron Leopoldville to Kamina will support these aircraft.
Command Control . .

1. These operations would be conducted under the operational control
of CINCLANT. through the commander of the US unit in the Congo. For this
purpose a US Joint tack force will be organized for support of the UNOC.
Air missions will be flow at the request of the UNOC Commander but the
US commander vill decide vhether to fly each mission in accordance with

his terus of reference and the US-approved rules of engagement. “This
vould be a command control arrangement similar to the existing state-Js

arrangements for USAF transport aircraft flying on intra-Congo missions

“4m support of UNOC.

2 CINCIANT is developing detadled operational plans in accordance
with the broad concepts outlined herein.

CONGO OPERATION
MILITARY ANNEX
US Military Unit in Support of UNOC

Basic Considerations

‘1. This annex is predicated on the assumption that the US will
provide US military forces in support of the UNOC as an expression of
US intent to undervrite, as necessary, UN objectives in respect to the
Republic of Coxe.

2. The US objective is, by insertion of US power, to iprevent an
4dnerease in Soviet Bloc influence in the Congo, to reintegrate Katanga,
and to strengthen and maintain a moderate and effective government in
Leopoldville. :

3. AUS decision to place in the Congo now a limited and discriminate
US military force would support and might well achieve this objective.
This force chould be adequate both to show the UB and UN flag, and to
accomplish, ewiftly and effectively, the military tasks which might arise.
The most demanding military contingency that might arise is if Tshombe were
to elect to initiate military action. Should this contingency develop,
the UNOC should be able to achieve rapid and complete domination of the
air over the area of operations. This would both facilitate UN ground
operations in Katanga and serve as a deterrent to outside intervention.

hk, Tha US force deployed into the Congo should be positioned in the
Katanga Province where it will be a positive and visible evidence to Tshoube

/

of the UB determination to support the United Netions. Only Kamina and /|

Elisabethville airfields, in Katanga, have runways of sufficient length
to support US air operations; Of these tuo, Kamina is better able to
support air logistic movements because of its greater runvey load capacity
and closer proximinity to logistic support from the Leopoldville area.

5. The Katanga air force is estimated to consist of the following:

Jet
Vampire fighters 1-2
Fouga Magister fighter-trainers 1 possible, as many as

; : 6 reported
Conventional: .
AT-6 trainers 7 confirmed; 10-12 possid]
Helicopters 1-2
Transports 18-27 assorted types

TAB A contains combat characteristics of combat aircraft.
COMPOSITION OF US MILITARY ELEMENT

1. A limited US tactical air force could accomplish the show of
foree mission. Considering the Katanga air capability, such a force
eould also accomplish the destruction of this capability. A composite
air strike unit of the following aircraft is considered appropriate:

8 F-100 fighter aircraft

@ RF-101 reconnaissance aircraft
Combat characteristics of the F-l00 are shown in Tab B. The personnel
involved in this unit will epproximtes300. Preliminary estimites of air

strike unit deployment requirements are at Tab C.

HW 49061 DocId:32626852 Page 3 : ,
2. Deployment of the Composite Air Strike Unit to the Congo will
require that adequate ground control, security commmications and other
support personnel be provided. The strength of. such a force will approxi-
mate 600 personnel. In the deployment of this force it is assumed that
UNOC ground forees now in the Congo will provide tactical security and
are adequate to cope with the threat posed by Katangan gendarmerie to
the air base vhere the US forces are deployed.

3. It dis estimated that the total forces contemplated could be
positioned at Kamina Air Base in the Congo within 48 to 72 hours efter
the order for their deployment is issued. Total air lift requirements
for the necessary ground support personnel and equipment are estimated
to be about 4O transport aircraft. The deployment of this force can be
accomplished via Adana, Turkey thence via Aden to Kamina or Wheelus,
Tripoli thence via Leopoldville to Kamina (fab D). —

Capabilities .

1. The foregoing composite air strike force, operating either alone
or in conjunction with other UN air forces (6 to 8 combat aircraft)
possesses the capability to accomplish the following tasks:

@. To demonstrate US presence. ;

bd. To provide limited air defense for Kamina and Elisabethville
against the Katangs air forces. A fully effective air defense system
would require considerable personnel and equipment not warranted under

the current situation.
