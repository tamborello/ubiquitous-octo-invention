Re memo Clerk OTIS L, PAGE dated 2/19/87 regarding
_ telephonic contact of HASKELL L. BROYLES, Givision V at the
Bureau,

SA BROYLES, Division V at the Bureau was teie-
phonically contacted in response to the specific questions
he had requested answers to in referenced memo, Mr. BROYLES
was advised that this office had no information concerning
MIGUEL TORRES who, according to newspaper publicity, had been
transferred from Angola Penitentiary where he was serving a
. nine year burglary sentence to the Orleans Parish Prison at
Y the request of District Attorney GARRISON other than informa-
. tion appearing in the newspapers. Mr. BROYLES was advised
that the. files of this office showed that a MIGUEL TORRES was
reported to this office as being a notorious burglar in the
New Orleans area but that the office did not know whether’ |
he was identical with the individual returned to New Orleans
by District Attorney GARRISON, BROYLES was further advised
that this office did not have any information as to the names.
of persons GARRISON's investigation has indicated are
involved in.the conspiracy to kill President KENNEDY. BROYLES
was further advised that this office did not have any informa-
tion as to the identity of the dangerous, physically powerful
Cuban believed to be one of a group of Cubans who allegecly
hid behind a billboard along the parade route in Dallas,
Texas, 11/22/63, and who the investigators of -the DA's Office
were apparently endeavoring to locate in Miami, Fla. recently.
It was pointed out to Mr, BROYLES that a newspaper account
stated that State Attorney RICHARD GERSTEIN in Miami, Fla.
was the only individual who apparently was taken into GARRISON's
confidence in regard to the efforts of investigators to
locate this unknown Cuban in Miami. It was suggested to Mr.
BROYLES that possibly the Miami Office might have received
inquiries as to the identity of this individual and might
possibly be able to furnish some information as to his identity.

A file was also located on MIGUEL ANGEL SILVA
TORRES, IS — CUBA, Bufile 105-117817, New Orleans file
105-1889, A review of this file showed considerable back-
ground information as well as the fact that ail of the
individuals mentioned above were relatives of MIGUEL ANGEL
SILVA, It was further determined that MIGUEL ANGEL SILVA
had New Orleans PD #94213, which was the same NOPD number
for the MIGUEL TORRES who was listed in the files of this
office as being a notorious burglar in the New Orleans area.
This information was telephonically furnished to SA BROYLES
at the Bureau at 12:50 PM on that date.

At 2:45 PM, Mr. BOB LENIHAN at the Bureau
telephonically contacted me at my residence and stated he
desired to know the source of the information regarding
GARRISON being a candidate for Lt. Governor which was con-
tained in a previous airtel submitted by this office. He
also desired to know whéther MIGUEL ANGEL SILVA or LUTGARDO
SILVA resided at 5008 Magawine Street in 1963. SA REGIS L.
KENNEDY was telephonically contacted and advised that he
had received the information concerning GARRISON possibly
being a candidate for Lt. Governor from various sources
and that it was his recollection that this information had
been furnished by JOE HEGMAN, also known as Joe Nola who
was formerly a criminal informant of the Las Vegas Office.
In addition, the same information had been furnished by NO
1309-C. A check was made of the City Directories maintained
in this office but no City Directory. could be located for
1963, however, the 1964 City Directory listed LUTGARDO R.
SILVA, apparently a brother of MIGUEL ANGEL SILVA TORRES, |
as residing at 2426 Port Street. The City Directory listed
CLETUS M. MILEY and OTTO A, KRIEGS at 5008 Magazine Street.
This information was telephonically furnished to Mr. LENIHAN
at the. Bureau at 3:44 PM.

On the night of 2/19/67, SA REGIS L, KENNEDY
telephonically advised that he had received information from
NO 1309-C that DON LOUIS, a former employee of GUY BANNISTER,
