AMCLATTER-1 on 2 August, TROUCHARD explained that we vere seeking a bests :
for an administrative type of review of his case and needed any records which
he might nave, such as notices from ODACID concerning his loss of citizene
ship, notices from hig attorneys in his attempts to regain citizenship

end copies of any pertinent correspondence, The objective is to determine if
hia citizenship can be restored without his having to leave the country,
return in an ioni grant status, and wait for a period of five yeers,

PBRUMEN surreptiviously, He eould only add the following commentary to those
records which were already in ODACID or ODURGE files: According to his
recollection, the paragraph of the Nationality Act (he believes it to be
Section 5) by which he was separated from his citizenship status stated that
before procedure can be taken to remove anyone's citizenship he mist have
Prior notification that guch -procedure ia being contempiated and be allowed
to express his side of the question, AMULATTER-1 states that he was never
called in to be questioned, but received an after-the-fact notification in
writing that ).e was no ‘longer an American citizen. At thie same tise, howe
ever, he states that he vag a constant visitor at ODACID where he had vorked
in close cooperation with the ODENVY office and his address was on record
with ODACID go that he could be reached easily at any time.”
