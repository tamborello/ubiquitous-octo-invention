MEMORANDUMN
MEMORANDUM
Miami May 8,1961..

_A situation of unrest and dissatisfaction vhich appeared within the NOC
before the invasion has apparently come to a head,

It originated when four members of the six Executives of the F.R.D. united
under the Generational T-esis, This provoked a crisis within the FRD and all
of it'a components organizations,

It appeared at the time that Rasco would be substituted by the Executive

: Coumisttee within Cuba. The Mlami Committee of the MOG backed Rasco, This si-~
tuation was so]ved at the time by a trip here to Miami, taken by Tucas, the
Goordinator of the MDC in Cuba, and at the tone time, General Coordinator of
the FRD.

In a personal conversation with Lucas, he informed me that they were not
satisfied with Rasco, but that he agreed that it was not the time for @ subs-
tituiion within the MDC with detriment to thie organization, the FRD and the
generel Revolutionary effort, At thie tine Lucas mentioned Fermin Peinado and
Melchor Gaston as possible: substitutes.

The non inclusion of an MDC member in the Revolutionary Council, produced
® further discontent within this organization, not withstanding the inference
of ¥iré caniona of amplifying the Council within Cuba, which implied that Incas,
the 0G Coordinator, would be a member of the Council,

in the last few days aoveral “maneuvers have taken place within the MDC and

although at first {t anneared thet Melchor Gaston-vould substitute Rasoo, sy ~ 0°

_Row weems that Fermin Peinado has the majority of the votes, within the Execu=——

tive of the MDC, An Executive neeting of the MDC is acheduled for today at
five and a Generel Assembly toenite at 8 o'clock and a deciaton. should. be. pro~
duosd in the Genoral Asserbly,

‘Th should be noted that this ie being done in the Mami Executive that
had previously backed Rasco, with the apparent consent of the Movement within
Cuba.

The Jesuit Society, which originally created the MDC in Cuba, has not
interfered in this development, but apparently prefers Melchor Gaston to
Fermin Peinado,

Raseo has been critized within his organization for appearing in the
newspapets with a "beard",
