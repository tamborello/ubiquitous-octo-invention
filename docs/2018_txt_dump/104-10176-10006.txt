Subject: LIRING/2 Report of Contact with Hunberto Gonzalez |Vega.

4. At 1000 on 9/12/68 at Identity A 1 LIRING/3 reported to Rowton .

that he had met with dumberto Gonzalez Vega on 5 and 6 December. He rim

lated that he had gone back. to-the apartment on Calle Manzanillo on the .

afternoon of 5 December, met Gonzalez and made a date to see thin again

on the morning of 6 December. when he returned about 1030 on that day

Gonz4lez' wife said that he had just stepped out to telepnone the embassy

of Ecuador. L/3 went out and found Gonzdlez at a nearby telephone booth ©

and managed to heve a relatively detailed chat with hia. ; i

2. According to 1/3, Gonzdlez sarted off by saying that ke bad been looking «|

forward to meeting L/3 for some time, since he had heard a great deal about
him from mutual friends. Gonzélez went on to say that although he had been

away from Guatemala for the past four years, he xept in touch with his
friends there. He dropped the nanes of Sandoval Alegria, Jorge Torrén end

a certain Avecillas (phon) who he assumed were known to Z2RING/3. He con-

cluded his introductor: ‘y remarks with tne statenent that jhe hoped he and

L/3 would becone friends, since they could be of nmutual ‘nelp.

3. Gonzdlez added that he was making a living selling books and was planning

to open a book store at the University. we indicated that he migat be able

to help L/3 financially if the latter were interested in this business ven-
- ture. Gonzalez then stated that he «as aware of L/3's arrest and detention - i

and alleged that he had advance information concerning L/3's trip to Guate-

mala in the company of | Identity D » He then asked L/3: whether

he knew the real purpose of Iden D trip. when L/3 replied in a non-committal

way, Gonzdlez ‘alleged thatIden Dhad been accused of misappropriation of funds 7

and tookvthe trip in the hope of defendi..g himself against these charges,

Gonzlez then produced a typewritten letter, undated and addressed to himself ,

and signed by "Cruz", advising him of the charges againstIden D. Gonzalez

told L/3 that the letter was from PAR headquarters and was received sone tine

beforelden Dand L/3 left on their trip. . F

thatiden Dhad been executed,as L/3 and many other people assumed. ke stated
that some months ago iden D nother in Mexico “ity had received a letter from
bim informing her that he was then at Salamd (phon). Gonz4lez added that it :
was not to be excluded thatiden Dhad made some sort d deal with the authoritie:

to save his skin. in exchange for services he might, perféra against Far in the .
future. . : : i

representing themselves to be from legitimate "revolutionary" novenents, '
Gonz&lez recounted that he binsolf Bae to go into hiding for Phe previous
two montks as a result of his having been exposed to a certain hulez who
had arrived in Mexico City with a group of Guatemalan exiles.) Goszdlez des~
eribed Hufez as a known memzber of the "Mano Blanca" and a forgner police
officer ("tercero jefe de la Judicial"). ‘ :

6. Gonzdlez then askdd 1/3 whether he had made any close friends while in ;
Guatemala. This,]}/3 fels,was an atteapt to scoke out his relationsaip with i
the Barrios brothers '( Miguel and Juén Beén Barrios). He told Soxton that
evaded the issue by giving a vague reply, to woich Gonz&lez replied: "Well, i
I hope to have a great surprise for you soon (‘alegria')* Gonz&iez then
suggested that they meet again on 12 December and promised to visit L/3 at
Ris home in the company of his wife, "so that 1/3's and his wife could keep
each other company while they themselves were talking in L/3's apartment."
L/3 told Rowton that he shot this idea down by explaining that althoug his

wife was retolutionary and trustworthy, he preferred to. xeep any politicial
discussions strictly between himself and Gonz4lez. The latter, then suggested
that he simply drop by L/3's house and that they both proceed sonewhere for

i @ coffee on a suitable pretext. 7 :

i 9, LIRING/3 described Humberto Gonzdélez Vega as a"rather tall"man ra about 4.78)
heavy (about 85-90 “k-) apparent age G2,with light eyes ("ojos claros") and
straight ("lacio" black hakr. He drew Rowton the attached sketch for possible
identification. ad

i” 8. IIRING/3 agreed with Rowton that it was advisable tor bim to tell LIRING/9 7
at his next meeting ef his contact with Gonzélez Vega to provoke a reaction .
fron the LIRING establishment.

b. According to GONZALEZ, Identity D, who
. left for Guatemala with LIRING-3 and, according! to
the latter, was probably executed after a period
of detention, may still be alive and may have made
a "deal" with the Guatemalan authorities., Identity D
had apparently misappropriated FAR funds before’
going to Guatemala. LIRING-93's remarks to LIRING-3,

as mentioned in ROWION's report of 5 December, may
be connected with Identity D's misdoings.'

\

¢. LIRING-3 hinted to LIRING-9 that. he nat
accept a teaching job at the University of Jalapa.
(Such a job was indeed recently offered to him.)
LIRING-9 advised LIRING-3 not to accept this as: he
would much rather send him on a trip to PBRUMEN.

\x d. From a letter received from Gustavo tv -Guatinnale ;

*COLINDRES Barrios, LIRING-3 gathered that the ~ q-

@BARRIOS brothers (Miguel aud Juan Leon) may soon Oudlerna ba
be released and may, in fact, contact him in Mexico
City. The original text of that letter and its

made to hin by Humberto GONZALEZ as another indica~

in the near future. LIRING-3 plans to write back

to the address given by COLINDRES and mention that

he is in contact with GONZALEZ in the hope of getting

a reaction from COLINDRES. i

2. The Station plans ‘to check further the identity given

“by GONZALEZ. Among other things, an attempt will be made
via LIKAYAK#. to te check whether 4 file in that name exisis in

Station may, at a later date, attempt spot surveillance of
