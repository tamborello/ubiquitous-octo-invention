FROM : DIAPL

SUBJECT: Supplement to Weekly Activities Report (3-9 July 1964)

Provided DIA concurrence on J-3 Buff report on CINCLANT Oplan 319-64,
This plan provides for the overthrow of the government of Cuba by
application of US military force to include:

a. Application of chemical/biological incapacitating agents to
reduce Cuban military capability to wage war;

b. Air strikes prior to introduction of US invasion forces;
ce. Invasion of Cuba by US forces.

The intelligence aspects of CINCLANT's plan need updating; the buff.
report points this out.

This is the first plan prepared by a Unified or Specified Commander
that plans for the specific use of c/B agents. CINCLANT, in the
forward to his plan, stated he did not favor the use of c/B agents.
The JC ever, are directing that he proceed with the planning.
