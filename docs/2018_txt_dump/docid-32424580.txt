I enclose a brief summary of an interview published in :
‘Revolucion of January 21 with José Matar the National Co-Ordinator
of the Committees for the Defence of the Revolution. i

' 2, This article gives an interesting picture of the widespread :
and comprehensive nature of the activities of these Committees,
though Sr. Matar's enthusiastic description sounds a little
comical in parts ("Ye are working fundamentally in recreation. ° .
» We have organised sack races .. 2"). The Committees are, as /*
- you well know, an all-pervasive organisation,’ and possibly the
most effective of the various mass organisations as a means. for
keeping the people in line behind. their leaders. The individuals _
_who comprise them wield considerable power at the grass roots
level and it is not unusual to see letters in the complaints
“eolugns of the nevspapers stating, for example, that a Committee
had refused to issue the necessary paper sanctioning a doctor's
recommendation for extra milk o ood supplies for an invalid. -."

 

  

3. For some time one has heard the figure of one Cuban in twelve
mentioned ag being a member of one or other of the mass organisations
put if Hatar is to be believed mezibership ofthe Defence Committees
alone accounts for more than one’ Cyban in six. He states that there
are.102,500 Committees, comprising 1% million people. You will °
also note that the organisation of the national structure of Defence.

which tie-in use for the sélection of members of ‘the new United

“of the seale and working upwards; The article gives no indication
as to how, or whether, the Committees of Defence are to be integrated
‘with the new United Party when the latter comes into being. As a
wateh-dog organisation they perform a rather different function from.
that of the party, but they seem to be extending their activities
“ +0 the point where some overlap between the two bodies looks likely’
. to occur. In the -Havana municiml area at least, they have acquired
so many administrative functions, particularly in connection with the
rationing scheme, that they cannot be dispensed with unless there is

An Economic Report for the Year 1962

fe GENERAT

  

4 1962 was designated the “Year of Planning" and
references had been made by Fidel Castro at the end
to the plen for 1962, no suck plan was ma public.
a number of sections of a i were circulated within
ious ministries at times Guring the year, by which

The economic situation generally had deteriorated in the
letter half of 1961 and on Fodruary 16 a three man co
was established with the +: of Direction of National
it consisted of President ticos, Guevara, Minister of
Industries and Carlos Raf Rodriguez, head of the National
in titute for Agrarian Reform (INRA), and ites purpose was to
improve. economic activity at all levels.

3 The food situation continued to worsen’ in the early part

  
 
 
  
 

of the year and in March it was found necessary to introduce

sm of rationing which Sill remains in force. The
distribution of supplies was at first somewhat uneven, leading

in one case to public Gisturbances, but improved during the year,
shortage was to some extent alleviated by supplies which

me from the Soviet Union and which were negotiated in a

pecial additional agreement in the summer of 1962. At the

r's end. the food situation tended to vary from place to

Ace and was usually better in the towns, particularly Hevana,

 

chan in the provinces.

ae The worsening of the food situation was due partly to
lack’ of local produce as well as imported food, and the need to
improve local production led to additional measures being taken
n the agricultural field. The most significant step was to

ailow more freedom of action to the small farmer operating in_
the private sector. Medicines were also in short supply, but
the situationwas consideradly improved by the provision by groups
in the U.S.A. of medicines to the value cf $60 million in
exchange for prisoners in Cuban hands.

  

 

 

   

  

5 In the early. part of 1°52 further changes were made in
che organisation of those artments concerned, with fo
de. The ex cisting three major state enterprises were broken

particular branch of impors export trade: these were expanded
in December by the addition.of a further three.

At the ena of the year the President declared that the
four-year period had been the stage during which
