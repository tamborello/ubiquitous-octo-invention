Cuba on January 17, 1965. . .

On January 19, 1965, MM T-1, a former Cuban official,

residing in Miami, who monitors many Cuban radio, broadcasts,
reported as. follows:

At 6:00 a.m. on January 19, 1965, Havana radio
station CMQ broadcast an announcement received from the
Ministry of the Armed Forces of Cuba: .

On Sunday, January 17, 1965, at 6:05 a.m., @° plane
described as having been manufactured in‘ North America, of a
type similar to the B~26, dropped a bomb, approximatély 250-
pounds, in the Province of Pinar del Rio, Cuba. “This” plane,
which came from the North, dropped the bomb, which exploded

BOSCH commented that the United States Department
of State denied the raid took place, but that the Cuban
Government had subsequently confirmed it, and as a resuit
the United States Government had placed BOSCH under constant
surveillance, BOSCH confided that he would leave Miami on
January 21, 1965, for New York City, for two days, and would
then travel to San Juan, Puerto Rico. He explained that
the purpose of this trip was to raise money upo he basis
of the press publicity received about the raid

 

 

MM T-2 expressed the opinion, after hearing BOSCH's
explanation, that it is highly unlikely that any such raid
took place, or that BOSCH could have obtained the. services
of a plane and pilot on such short notice. Ws

 

MM T=2 also pointed out that an Aero Commandsr does not
have a bomb bay, and that the windows do not open, since they .
are of the “built-in” type. Consequéntly, the bomb could not
have been thrown out of the window as alleged by BOSCH. GY

MM T-2 noted that BOSCH was very mon-spécific, spoke in
general terms, and gave no details which were susteptible to —

being checked, with the exception of his claim concerning * ibs
boo, having been thrown out of the window of the Aero Commander ()

MM T-2 said that BOSCH made no secret of the fact '
that his purpose in making this announcement was to enable him
to collect more contributions from sympathetic Cubsén exiles,

The Miami Office-is of the opinion that BOSCH's
claim is a complete fabrication, and that the Cuban
Government. issued a false confirmation of this fabrication
in order to take advantage of the publicity for propaganda
purposes,

fit is to be recalled that MM T~2 had been
propositiohed by BOSCH to pilot a plane on a raid which wasty)
supposed to have been in the planning stage. BOSCH has iu
not revived this plan,] and it appears that the publicity
he has received concefning the alleged.1/17/65 raid has
served his purpose in laying. the groundwork. for collection
of additional contributions. .

 

It is to be noted that BOSCH is one of the
principal. subjects in the case entitled, "ORLANDO BOSCH

Re: HIRE SECRET

On January 20, 1965, MH T-4, who is acquainted

with some of 5 associates, reported that on January 18,
1965, WILLI ILA, gon of the former owner of the fe
Niagara Sugar’ Mill, disclosed that at about 3:00 ‘p.m. — -

on January 18, 1965, he had been requested to come to the 2
MIRR headquarters, where he was told that his father’s
sugar mill had just been bombed by the MIRR.

MM T=4 commented on the January 19, 1965, .confirma-
tion by the Cuban Government of tho raid. Ee expressed the
opinion that FIDEL CASTRO most likely issued a false
confirmation in order to take advantage of BOSCH’s public .
announcement for the purpose of embarrassing the United States
Government.

On January 20, 1965, Hr. WALLACE SHARLEY, United
States Customs, Miami, Florida, advised his agency had been
unable to verify that any B26 planes (as alleged in BOSCH's
public announcement) had made any flights from the South _
Florida area during the pertinent period of tine, and Customs .
had been unable to obtain amy confirmation that the raid actually
took place. , rn

On January 21, 1065, Mr. FAY LIMEHAN, Supervising”
Inspector, Federal Aviation Administration, advised that his
agency had been unable to confirm that any such raid as
alleged by BOSCH bad actually taken place.

On January 21, 1965, MM T-5, a federal dgency
which conducts intelligence. investigations, advised that it
had received no information in confirmation ‘that such a raid
had taken place, a ey aa ic announge: ntgof BOSCH and
the Cuban Government
x. u Hee HERES aus wal

It is to be noted t ‘on November 20,°1964, BOSCH
held a press conference in Miami, at which tine he announced —
another bombing raid over-Cuba. On that occasion, no confirma-

tion was ever received, and well-informed scurces expressed
the opinion that his announcement was & fabrication.
