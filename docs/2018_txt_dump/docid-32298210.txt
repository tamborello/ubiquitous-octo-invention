The Intelligence Unit of the Miami Police
Department comes under’the supervision of Captain LEE
NAPIER. The. Intelligence Section has been investigating
‘matters relating to Cuban revolutionary activities during
the past two and one-half years, and has made several
seizures of guns and a number of arrests relating to
violations of local ordinances. It is possible that
' some of NAPIER's contacts with Cuban revolutionists
have been of a legitimate nature pursuant to his official
duties. — .

U. S. Customs, Miami, has advised that NAPIER
has, in different ways, tried to get information from
U.S. Customs, both in Washington, D. C., and Miami,
Florida, concerning anti-TRUJILLO groups. They have
refused to give him any information, suspecting that he ;
would transmit this information to the Dominican Republic.

AL TARABOCHIA, Deputy Sheriff, Intelligence Unit, |
Dade County Department of Public Safety (formerly the :
Sheriff's Department), advised that the Intelligence Unit . . ,
does not trust or cooperate with NAPIER.

Miami Office contacts NAPIER only on certain
matters within his jurisdiction, and then with great
circumspection, and considers most information furnished
by NAPIER as being self-serving and not within the realm
of verification.

 

 

. It is noted that RODRIGUEZ COUIROhas, on several
, occasions, desired MM 639-S to be introduced to NAPIER.*
