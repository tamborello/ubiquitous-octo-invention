CHRONOLOGY - CIA/CUBAN/MAFIA
PLOTS TO ASSASSINATE FIDEL CASTRO

Fidel Castro is sworn in as Premier (replacing
Jose Miro Cardona) :

Primier Castro, at the mass funeral of 27 dock

workers killed yesterday, implied that the a
United States was involved in the "sabotage” of
the. munitions ship which exploded in Havanna .
Harbor. The U.S. issued a "vigorous protest —

    

’ Secretary of State Herter told Cuba's Charge.
d'affaires that Castro's implication that the -
U.S. was involved in the munitions ship explo-.
sion was ‘baseless, erroneous, and misleading.”

Dulles approvés "thorough consideration be
given to the elimination of Fidel Castro."

Sabotage and terrorism by nauler Sague.
Tauler Sague, "La Cruz", a counterrevolutionary

group and Curia Ramps infiltrate through Pienta
Hicarcas zone in Mantanzas Province for plot

against Castro. CIA provides ammunition.

A US-based private plane ‘is shot down over Cuban
territory by Cuban Government troops. The
American pilot and co-pilot are captured.

US Secretary of State Herter declares (at a news
conference: "...there is one very disturbing —
development that is taking place in Cuba, and.
that is that anti-communism is now being made-
synonymous with anti-revolution, and that those --
who express concern about Communist influence are
-now being accused of being anti-revolution, and
anti-Castro..."

US State Department annourices that. the US
economic aid program to Cuba will be terminated ~
on Dec. 1, 1960. US military aid will be termin~
ated in June.

Cuban Government orders two attaches of the US °° |
Embassy in Havanna to leave the country within ..-
24 hours. They are accused of "conspiring with -
counter revolutionaries.” :

Richard Bissell, CIA Deputy Director of Plans,
(DDP), directs Sheffield Edwards, CIA Director
of the Office of Security, to devide a plan to
kill Castro.
