BUONO, on 3/24/64, advised he knew FRA OMPENS LERO
very Well. He stated that BOMPENSTERO "bucked" ONY MIRABILE
(now deceased)’ for control of the rackets in San Diego following
World War II,..and BOMPENSIERO has always been close to the
MATRANGAS!,. BUONO stated that it was his recollection that
MIRABILE and BOMPENSIERO made an agreement whereby BOMPENSIERO
operated North of Broadway in San Diego and MIRABILE operated
South of Broadway. This was prior.to the time BOMPENSIERO
was sent to prison on a bribery conviction in 1955.

BUONO did not recognize the photograph of MARCO
LIMANDRI, but stated that he first. met JOSEPH J MANDRI

F
in San Bernardino through ome RALPH SPEZZANO (phonetic), ont e

a bail bondsman. LIMANDRI was then said to be active in
narcotics and prostitution. LIMANDRI later came to San Diego.

JOSEPH ERNES' MATRANGA was believed by BUONO to
be the head of the young Italian hoodlum element in San Diego,
and his brother, GASPARE MATRANGA, was once thought to be the
enforcer and strong man of this group. : ;

PRIZIOLA was not’ known to BUONO.

BUONO was asked to identify "ARNATO" or "ARNOTO"
(Said by LA 4448-C-TE to be the "Capo Regime” of the San
