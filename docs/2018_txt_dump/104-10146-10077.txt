The draft report makes a point on page 2000580. Obviously,
documents post-dating the opening date would not have been in the
file at the time it was opened. (U) |

It is noted that Mrs. Egerter's name appears on pages
2000581, 2000582, 2000584, 2000585, 2000588, and 2000599.
The HSCA editor has noted this suggesting that her position be cited
in some instances, and we would suggest that the name be deleted. (C)

On page 2000584, in the full paragraph in the middle of the page,
the statement is made that "Mrs. Egerter claims to have prepared" papers
in response to a State Department request. She doesn't "claim," she simply
stated that is the way she recalled it. We interviewed her and the story
is quite simple. On page 2000586, the statement appears at the top of
the page that "CI/SIG was cited as the 'source document.’ " Since CI/SIG
is an organization, it is not a source document per se. Is the draft
report correct and is the citation someone's shorthand reference of
authority rather than its source? (C)

Page 2000590 makes the statement that a CS component "failed
to act...by initiating the opening of a 201 file on a person who posed
a potential counter-intelligence threat." That represents an operational
judgment as to what consitutes a possible subject of counter-intelligence
interest and what action should stem from it; there is no one that we
saw on the Committee staff who has any competence to make such a judgment,
particularly in the present case. It would have been a judgment call.
then, and today still seems correct. (U)

SUBJECT: Comments on HSCA Draft Reports Classified Top Secret

This particular package seems to consist of two drafts, one
of which is numbered pages 2000566 through 2000592. It appears
to have some redundancy with an earlier draft having to do with
the operye of the Oswald File. The second paper consists of pages
-14.

I. Oswald File

As a matter of form, one does not refer to the "Deputy Directorate
of Operations" but to the Directorate of Operations. The DDO, literally,
is the person of the Deputy Director and it is only in shorthand that
the acronym DDO is used to refer to the Directorate of Operations.
This comment applies to pages 2000570-2000571. (U)

On page 2000572, the last three lines of the first paragraph
might be edited to read as follows: "...to determine who the writer was,
who opened the file, and when it was done." (U)

_ On the same page, did the CIA reply say that disseminations
inside CIA “has always" been based on written requirements? There
are bound to have been ad hoc disseminations. (U)

’ At pages 2000574, 2000575, and 2000577, references are made
to William Lawson and William Larson, apparently different spellings of
the same name. Is this the name of an Agency employee? Should it be
removed? {(C)

Is the references to "persons associated with the Deputy Director
of Operations" mean literally such a personal association or does it refer
to peopte in the Directorate? In the same sentence the statement is
rather categorical about a document warranting the opening of a 201 file;
rather than the word "would" it would be more appropriate to use the word
"could." Such an action was a judgment cal] and would not necessarily
have meant that a 201 file would or would not have been opened. (U)

III. Oswald Correspondence During his Soviet Residence

At the top of page 2 we can smile at the HSCA's description of
its perception of something as “unusual,” which is a reflection of

-its frequently impressionistic approach to the matters of intelligence.

However, I am not inclined to make issue with it. (U)

On pages 7 and 10, there are references to HTLINGUAL "volumes."
It was my impression that there was very little Oswald-related correspondence
in HTLINGUAL, but the use of the word "volume" conveys an impression

‘of size that is not warranted. Question: Were there four file folders

with a few pieces of paper, or were there large volumes of materials

in which there were a few scraps of paper relating to Oswald? If my
impression is correct, a comment on this would be an appropriate assist
in contributing to the precision. with which the Committee discusses the
matter. {)
