SUBJECT: Counter-Revolutionsry Organization, L9 February 1971
Alpha 66, and its Activities

“"L. A reliable source of the Miami Field Office furnished the Following
information. 7

2. Alpha 66 was founded in late 1962 or eariy 1863 by Eloy Gutferrez
Henoyo, Armando Fleites, Antonio Yeetana, Andres Nazario Sargent, Dr. Diego

: Nedina and others, as a cover for the Second Nativnil Front of Escanbray.

3. In 1966 it separated from the Second Nativasl Front of Escambray.”
On 6 Jan 71 Andres Nazario Sargent. became the "Suprese Leader" of Alpha 66.
They are alleged to have 300 active members and 3,00 inactive aembers, Up
to 6 Jan 71 there were no ex-members of Brigade 2506 registered as active or -
inactive meabers. There are professionals, former wealthy men and farmers whe

are active senbers.

4. Raids against Cuba commenced in 1963, the last raid was in October
1970 in Banes, Oriente Province, where.15 men allegedly Landed. [C/S Comment:
Sources, arriving on the airlift, have reported that of these 15 men five

‘were killed and two taken prisoners at Baire, They also said rumors. were
' that the remaining cight were cither killed or. taken prisoners.] There have

been three Landings, one in 1967 and two in 1970, alsu 14 raids from 1963 to
October 1970. They have also attacked one ship on the high seas and two ships
while in Cuban harbors. During the attack on the high seas LL fishermen were
taken prisoners and brought to the US, They were later returned to Cuba.
These lindings, raids and attacks on ships have bern allegedly conducted to
awaken the dormant status of. counter-revolutionary activities and to create

a state of revolutionary conscience within the Cudans who still resain in Cuba.

5. Some people consider Alpha 66 to be a comtter-revolutionary organization ©

with a leftist tendency. There are rumors that it has a clandestine group, with-
in Cuba, who gathers intelligence information for it. However, to my knowledge
these rumors have not been confirmed.

6. In mid-1970 the Miami FBI raided the Alpha 06 office, and took part of
their files with them, Apparently Alpha 66 had duplicates hidden because today
duplicates of the files which the FBI removed are in tneir filing cabinets.

- 7. On occasions some of their leaders have twen arrested, or interrogated,
but have been set Free soon thereafter. At the present time Alpha 66 dues uot
have the full cooperation nor bucking ef the majority of the Cuban exiles. In
fact it is very limited. To my knowledge there is so prominent exile connected
with Alpha 66; the reason being that they are under the impression: -the organ-
ization, aa a whole, ‘has leftist tendencies.

8. As far as I know there is no established rviutionship between Alpha 66
and the "Truth sbout Cebu Committee", nor to L have any knowledge that it is

organizing any type of "Cuban Mafia".
