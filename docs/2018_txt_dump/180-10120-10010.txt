HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)
Reference is made to letter to the Attorney General

from G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA,
dated June 20, 1978. . : :

Referenced letter furnished a list of Special .
Agents of the FBI believed by the HSCA to have been involved
in the unlawful flight investigation of James Earl Ray, prior
to the death of Martin Luther King, Jr., and requested these
agents be made available for interview by the HSCA. This
letter is to confirm that all agents except Rowen B. Ayers
(deceased) , have been cleared from their employment agreement
and are available for HSCA interview. Arrangements for
interviews can be made through contact with representatives of
the Congressional Inquiry Unit (CIU), Records Management
Division, FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ). .

Referenced letter furnished a list of over 500 names
of known and probable associates and possible contacts of
James Earl Ray. The FBI was requested to determine the number
of informants, operatives or sources on this list and attempt
to ascertain if any such individual would consent to interview
by the HSCA. In addition, it was requested that files of any
such individual be prepared for review by the HSCA's Chief
Counsel and Director. On July 13, 1978, HSCA Staff Member
Michael Eberhardt modified this request to include field office
files concerning any such person identified as an informant ,
operative or source.

According to a search of FBIHQ files, three individuals
listed in referenced HSCA letter were identified as present
or former FBI informants, operatives or sources. These are as
follows:

Informant A (probable associate). This individual. - --
advised on July 19, 1978, that he did not desire to be inter-
viewed or contacted under any circumstances by anyone from the oe
HSCA. Since this individual was operated as an informant from
1960 to April, 1966, and there are no documents in his file
subsequent to April, 1966, this informant file is deemed outside
the period of HSCA interest and is not: being made available.:

Informant B (probable associate). This individual
was contacted on July 19, 1978, and stated he does not want
his confidential relationship with the FBI revealed to the .
HSCA. Since this individual was not opened as an informant
until August, 1972, and closed in March, 1973, his file is
also believed to be outside the period of HSCA interest
ani is not being made available.

Informant C (probable associate). Efforts by two
field offices of the FBI to locate this former informant have
been negative. He was last reported to have left the United
States for Europe, exact address unknown. Since this informant
was operated for a brief period in 1968, and was an inmate of
Missouri State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri, his
FBIHQ informant file will be made available to the HSCA's
Chief Counsel and Director. All information tending to
identify this informant will be excised in accordance with the
Memorandum of Understanding. Arrangements for review by
Mr. Blakey should be coordinated with the CIU, Records Manage-
ment Division, FBIHQ. Informant's field office file at the
Kansas City Field Office was destroyed during routine file
destruction on January 7, 1978. The HSCA should also note
that this individual was interviewed durine course of FBI's
investigation of the King assassination and results of interview
along with informant's identity, was reported in FBIHQ
assassination investigative file, which has been made .available
to the HSCA.

dated April'12, 1978. This letter requested'access to FBL
files of all informants within the Invaders organization
during 1968 and that the FBI make available for interview
FBI Agents who handled these informants. . This letter also
identified several documents from FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ)
files concerning the relationship between Klan members and
Arthur Hanés, Sr.’,, in the course of Hanes' representation
of James Earl Ray. The HSCA requested that the FBI contact
informant(s) who provided information in these documents to
determine if these informants would be agreeable to inter-
view by the HSCA.° , _ : ,

This. letter is to confirm that on May 17, 1978,
at the House Office Building, Mr. Blakey reviewed a copy of
the files of FBI informants who provided information con-
cerning the Invaders. All information which could identify
these informants was excised from the files. Notes taken

tatives of the FBI. These notes will be maintained by the
Congressional Inquiry Unit, Records Management Division,

The Memphis Office of the FBI has provided the
identities of Agents who handled the above informants. -
Since in some cases more than one Agent handled a particular
informant, it is suggested the HSCA review this material to
determine which Agent the HSCA feels should be interviewed.
This material is available for HSCA access at’FBIHQ. ~~

JUSTIFICATION
014984
This subpoena is required to allow staff access to the

files of informants who perhaps have played pivotal roles in
matters that are in need of resolution by the Committee.
Specifically, the need for access to these files is as follows:

1) Access to the unexcised Invader Informants' files
is needed so that the staff, particularly Bill Webb and Ken
McHargh who are intimately familiar with the King Security file,
can ascertain the role of the Invaders, if any, in the assassina-
tion and, if necessary, interview the informants themselves.

2) Access to the unexcised informant file of the
JER associate who was acting as an FBI informant in 1968 is needed
to ascertain his contact with JER, if any, and to interview him

if necessary.
