ever owning any Webcor-Dormeyer stock. He said he is not
acquainted with MARIANNE RYAN and did not know she was a
former wife of ALEX. HAFFA stated that a check of the
current stockholders of Webcor Corporation disclosed that
ALEX had no stock in: the corporation in his name.

VIII. MISCELLANEOUS

CG T-29 advised that he had received information
that ALEX plans again this year to travel and vacation in
Europe, as he has for the past two years. Informant said
that ALEX may also buy a Mercedes Benz while in Germany,
and use this to travel in Europe. Informant said that
ALEX may also attempt to bring this Mercedes Benz back to
the United States with him after he completes his vacation.
CG T-32 advised that he had received information during
the early part of October, 1962, that ALEX also complained
that he may possibly lose his auto license because of
improper registration. It is to be noted that during
the early part of.:dctober, 1962, approximately ten Chicago
hoodlums had their auto licenses revoked because of improper
registrations, and for this reason ALEX was probably con-
cerned over the possible revocation of his license.

The West Germany Federal Criminal Police advised
that the Munich, Germany Criminal Police had attempted to
interview HELMUT MAIER, 6X-hiSband of SUZANNE FUEGER, in
effort to obtain from him | any information he may have :
regarding the activities of ALEX, The Munich, Germany
Police advised that MAIER's employer was contemplating on
establishing MAIER as his export agent in New York City
toward the latter part of 1962, or the early part of 1963,
and that MAIER could possibly be contacted regarding ALEX
at that time. ;

During a surveillance of ALEX by agents of this
office in the early part of September, 1962, ALEX indicated ‘
to a passing motorist that they knew each other. It was
determined from the registration of the motorist to whom
ALEX waved to that this person was MILES FLEISHMAN, FLEISHMAN
