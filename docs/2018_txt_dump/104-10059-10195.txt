street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED | was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental _

basis. in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

', Vion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being, released by the Warren Commission. | -LILYRIC was an alternate photo- os

graphic base. Tt was ‘Tocated in an upper ‘story of an apartment buitding

_ on the same side ‘of the street as the LIMITED site but in the middle oF
“the block south. “It had a planted view of the front. ‘gate of the Soviet |
- Embassy. LICALLA, ‘the third photographic site, was, located in ‘one’ of a .

row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound. a

“This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The .
. purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of

. Soviet personnel. The ‘three photographic sites were managed by a re- -

crutted agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

_and Mexican father (deceased). This ‘agent collected the film. from the. -

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The Fitm was. then de- Sa

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print, strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early aed] due to the resig-
“nation of a technician, ‘this Film Tike that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was .

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two. officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents: aa

 

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. — The team oes
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone oF

“interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. ‘These agents were aware of

 

_ the LIMITED site since e they had been ‘isgued LIMITED photographs for

a identification purposes.

Who was the unidentified Man at a meeting with Richard Helms

on 12 March 1964 who would have known if Oswald chad been a a

CIA informant?

 

Answer: :

oy The unidentified : man who accompanied Mr. Helms ‘to the 12 March a an
1964 meeting was Mr. David E. Murphy, then chief of the Soviet

“Russia Division, DDP. See paragraph 6 of the ‘tab 9 memorandum ene

of record of this meeting for Mr. Helus' reported remark that oe

 

on he: and Mr. Murphy ‘were the two Clandestine Services officers -

 

 

wo who certainly would know whether or not Oswald had been an a

agent: for CIA in the Soviet Union.
