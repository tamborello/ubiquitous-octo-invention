Introduction
It has long been known that the Soviet state security service

(currently the KGB) resorts to abduction and murder to combat what

' are considered to be actual or potential threats to the Soviet regime,

These techniques, frequently designated as "executive action" and known

within the KGB as. "liquid affairs" (Mokryye Dela), can be and are employed

abroad as well as within the borders of the USSR. They have been used

against Soviet citizens, Soviet emigres and even foreign nationals. A list

of those who have fallen victim to such action over the years would be a very

long one and would include even the co-founder of the Soviet state, Leon .
TROTSKY. Several well known Soviet assas sination operations which have
occurred since the rise of KHRUSHCHEV attest to the fact that the present
leadership of the USSR still employs this method of dealing with its enemies.
The sudden n disappearance or unexpected ‘death of a person known to
possess anti-Soviet convictions immediately raises the suspicion of Soviet

involvement. Because it is often impossible to prove who is responsible

1. Strictly speaking, the term "executive action" encompasses

diversionary activitics (such as sabotage) as well as terroristic activitics.

This paper, however, discusses only the terroristic aspect of Sovict

executive action, namely kidnapping and assassination,

for such incidents, Sovict intelligence is frequently blamed and is
undoubtedly credited with successes it actually has not achieved. On the
other hand, even in cases where the Sovict hand is obvious, investigation
often produces only fragmentary information, due to the KGB ability to
‘cam ouflage its trail. In addition, Soviet intelligence is doubtless involved.
in incidents that never become officially recognized as executive action,
such as assassinations which are recorded as accidents, suicide, or

natural deaths.

 

All of the factors cited above have helped to obscure Soviet practices
in regard to assassinations. and abductions outside the USSR, Certain
observations can be made, however, which will help to put these practices

; into their proper perspective. These observations are set forth in the

following paragraphs and are based on information produced by the investigatior
of known or suspected Soviet operations which have occurred since World
War Il, as well as from information supplied by defectors during this period.
Targets

The large numbers of former citizens of the USSR (and of imperial

Russia) living abroad in protest against the Sovict regime have been a

 

continuing cause for concern to the Soviets since the carly twenties,

Re: Request - J. Seelmaecker (IRS 75-2105)

Re request for copy of the study entitled: "Soviet Use of Assassination
and Kidnapping." (MOTE: Requestor states he is a German national).

“There is attached a sanitized version of the study, which was |

“apparently prepared in or prior to February 1964, and transmitted to

the Warren Commission at that time. However, the report as trans-
mitted was classified SECRET. There is some indication that the
document has since. been declassified, and National Archives may have
a declassified version. : ;

~ Would it be appropriate at ‘this point to initiate inquiry with
Natinal Archives to determine if, in fact, Archives does have this

declassified version, and to provide us a copy of the study and details”

relating to the declassification, so that CI may amend its record for

' FOIA requests relating to this subject matter.

A copy of the sanitized version (with deletions on pages 25 and

26) is attached, and we will await your advice before we consider this”

study as actually released. .It would apprear. appropriate that. this
study should be routed. through el for coordination

prior to release. A ‘copy of the transmittal Tettér to the Warren

Commission is also attached for your assistance.
