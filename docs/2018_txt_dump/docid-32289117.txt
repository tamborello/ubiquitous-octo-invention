Reported Plans to Blow Up Cuban Ship —
in Mexican Port, Possibly Veracruz

a) The Explosive Charge - Rectangular in
shape with the following approximate dimensions: 30 x 20
x 7 centimeters, The charge consists of a block of
explosive covered with a solid, putty-like plastic
material, the entire surface of which is covered with
black insulation tape. At one of its edges, 2 plugs
for an iron pipe of 3/4 inch diameter were found. These
are fastened separately by a screw to lengths of galvanized | © .
iron pipe of the same diameter and approximately 15 !
centimeters long. The pipes are located inside the
explosive charge and serve as a lodging for the detonators.
Two metallic rods of 7 millimeters in diameter and 10
centimeters long extend along the longitudinal axis of
the charge. They have screws at the ends which serve

to fasten them to the spools.(/$)

The explosive inside is white in color and
plastic-like. Its characteristics and potency are unknown
It will be necessary to conduct analyses to determine

its class and type.(S) ; @»

It was ascertained that the explosive charge
( was not assembled and ready for detonation, since it did
not contain the proper elements for starting, p agating
and amplifying the detonation. PHers6enpY Wo. 13S >}

b) Spools-magnets - There are four of them, . |
and they consist of spools of approximately 3 x 2x1 i
inches, containing at their ends two metallic plates a)
fastened by bolts. Each of these plates has a bore hole .
into which the small rods used to hold the charge are
placed. On the side opposite that containing the bore
hole, there is a metallic plate whose function is to
serve as the surface which is connected by the magnet
to any metallic surface. Photograph No. 1148)

Detonators - The detonators are of the
percussion type and apparently are activated by an
electric current. They have an approximate Length(s)

They are composed of a percussion mechanism,
a safety and an explosive charge. Photograph No. 12.(/5|

Because of the condition in which they were
found and because they were found to be safe for handling
and transportation, they were not destroyed. ($)

V. Transportation of the Explosives and Their
Delivery to the D.F.S.(S)

The explosives (complete charge and recovered
remnants), detonators and magnets, perfectly wrapped
and packed, were brought to this city on the afternoon
of the 4th and were handed over to the Federd Security
Police on the morning of May 5, 1967. Later, at
11:30 A.M. on the same day, they were sent to a powder
magazine at the explosives plant, after having first
been examined by the Director of the D.F.S. . The explosives
are now at the disposal of the proper authorities /S)
