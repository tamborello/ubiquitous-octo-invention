902 South 8th Street is on the west side of
the street intersecting South 8th Street;on the east
side is Montrose Street. This intersection is less than
100 feet from the target address. On Montrose Street,
which is believed to be well within the 1000 wire foot
requirement for an RFMT installation,a@me the previously
déseribed parochial institutions. The institutions
include a rectory, convent, church and school running
from 712 to 730 Montrose Street. The current Philadelphia
Telephone Directory lists the owner of this property as —
DENNIS J. DOUGHERTY (TR) of 225 North 18th Street, Phila-

delphia, which address is for the Missionary Servants of

the Blessed Trinity. The parochial institutions in the
700 block of Montrose Street are listed under St. Mary
Magdalene de Pazzi Church, 712 Montrose Street.

TECHNICAL REVIEW OF TELEPHONE .-’ CABLE SERVICE
FOR RFMT INSTALLATION IN THE VICINITY OF
902 South 8th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

In reviewing the submitted cable records it was assumed that,
as a matter of company policy, telephone drop wires are not run across
streets in close proximity to the target area and, therefore, the maximum
‘use of existing cable facilities will be most desirable. If this assumption
is correct, it will be necessary to have block drawing $9-7 for complete .
details of the cable serving the parochial institutions before a final .
decision can be reached as to the cable modifications required and the \
ability of the RFMT unit to properly excite (activate) the target instrument. \

: Based on the data furnished, it is estimated that there are 924
cable feet between the telephone terminal box in the rear of 906 South
8th Street (cable terminal to which target instrument is connected) and
the telephone terminal box serving the parochial institutions. To this

_ must be added the wires connecting the target instrument and the RFMT
unit to the respective terminal boxes. If cable pairs are used, it. will be
necessary to open the cable splice on Montrose, in the front of the high
school, to insert especially designed chokes . between the central office
and the target instrument. A pair of wires must be provided to connect
between the cable pair serving the target instrument and the cable terminal
at the institution. This pair must be connected on the instrument side of
the chokes and must not have stubs nor multiple appearances. It may
require opening several cable splices to provide this service.

There is no assurance that the RFMT unit will properly excite
the target instrument from a plant in the institutions after the above-
listed work has been completed as the wire distance involved is in the
fringe range for the RFMT unit.

- If it is possible to run a drop wire directly from the terminal
box in the: rear of 906 Sout:h 8th.Street to the institutions, consideration
should be given to concealing the special chokes in or near this terminal —

Reurlet 1/5/65 outlining technical details of the proposed
installation of Radio-Frequency Microphone-Telephone (RFMT)
coverage in captioned matter and furnishing cable and block prints
of the target area. This material has been reviewed by the Laboratory.
The Laboratory's technical observations are attached for the
assistance of your sound-trained Agents.

If itis not possible to run a drop wire directly from the
telephone terminal box in the rear of $06 South 8th Street to an
area for secure concealment of the RFMT unit in the parochial
institution, it is suggested that consideration be given to obtaining
a secure space either in the high school.or in close proximity thereof.
A leased pair of telephone wires may be used to connect the RFMT
unit to. the central plant where personnel can monitor the microphone

coverage.

should be advised.

prior Bureau authorization. In the event a misur is authorize

pox and running the drop wire from this point to the institutions, This
drop wire, along with the drop wire serving the target instrument, will
be connected to the instrument side of the chokes. The other end of
the chokes will be connected to binding posts 8 in the terminal box at

_ the rear of 906 South 8th Street, The RFMT unit should properly excite
the target instrument with this wiring plan.

Consideration should be given to locating a plant within the —
“grop" area served by the terminal box at the rear of 906 South 8th Street.
While the block diagram limits this area to 806-8 Christian to 906 South
8th Street, it may be possible, with company cooperation, to extend the
area to include 908-22 South 8th and the high school.’ —

If a secure plant can be located in this area it may be possible
to conceal the special chokes near the terminal box Serving the target
instrument and connect a téephone drop to the plant. Such an arrange~-
ment will not require modification to the telephone company cable plant.
It will net be necessary: for the leased pair connecting the central
monitoring plant with the RFMT unit to appear in the same terminal
box nor will a special line be required to transmit the audio back to the
central monitoring plant aé any line witha quality equal to that used for
long-haul microphone installations will serve this purpose.

It should be-pointed out that parallel drop wire attenuates the:
RFMT energy more than. cable pairs therefore the use of parallel drop
wire runs should be kept to a minimum. ,

The cable prints and block diagrams are being retained in the ,
Laboratory for reference in the event additional technical assistance is
desired. ,

Re Bureau June communication dated 12/18/64 and
Philadelphia letter to Bureau dated 12/17/64, a

Referenced communications were in regard to .
establishing technical coverage 902 South 8th Street,
Philadelphia, Pa.

Per request referenced Bureau letter, enclosed 7 i
herewith are cables prints showing telephone service for . ‘
the target installment and block diagram of telephone cable
service in target area. ;

Target telephone is for ALFONSO MAIORIELLO, 902
South 8th Street, telephone number MA 7+6443, serficed by
sub cable 19-227 pair. There are two appearances of this
count, one in the rear of 906-South 8th Street on binding
post number 8 (see sketch S9-8). The second appearance is
af 89} Nashington Avenue binding post number 7 (see sketch
S10-S).

. Considering that Philadelphia's proposal in this
matter was to obtain a secure location for a RFMT unit in
|: parochial institution, further that this unit would be-

 

used to relay technical coverage at target area to Phila-
\delphia's central plant, the following information is
