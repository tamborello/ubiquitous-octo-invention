come out on the table.

Mr. Lombard. I am not suggesting what time, but I am talk-
ing about a two step process so that we have a reading process,
and then that we would have suggestions on the cases, and then
later we would go to the findings and recommendations.

The Chairman. It may be that your suggestion, Mr. Lombard,
would save us time, and I think we now ought to strive to save.-~
as much time as possible, but it would have to be agreeable
to the members that we proceed this way, and if we give this
sidtidons’) tim, I think that along with any suggested changes
in the general text, members should Prepare such amendments as
they might wish to make to the findings, and then the plenary
session could be confined.

Mr. Lombard. You have said it better than I said it.

The Chairman. I am following you.

We'll have to settle on the dates also.

Mr, Lombard, It seems to me that, in other words, if
we would set next Wednesday for our plenary.; session, which
would be for the purpose of going over the findings and recom-
mendations and approving the report on that date -- well, if
possible, and then we would have the three days following this
for the filing of additional reports, so that could really
be done by Friday, the whole thing wrapped up.

The Chairman. Well, if you think that that is the most
expeditious way to move -- Mike?

Mr. Madigan. I would just want to say that if any dates
are going to be set, it would be the middle of next week
because Senator Baker's wife's grandmother died, and he's
not going to be able to be back here until iate Thursday.

It is a personal problem.

Mr. Lombard. If: we do want to work on this individually
rather than as a group, it is.going to go fast.

The Chairman. Well, how does it strike the Committee,
this proposal?

Senator Mondale. It's the Chairman's choice.

The Chairman. All right. The only problem that I see
with it is that if we delay it for another week, when we do
go into the plenary session, we've got to-go in prepared and
the Committee has to be satisfied to confine the plenary

sessions to the findings, the recommendations, and the summary

TE P-StCret— :

Mr. Lombard. Right.

The Chairman. And then when we hold the plenary sessions
we confine them to the findings and recommendations and:the .
summary findings.

Mr. Lombard. Yes, sir. Because it's my opinion that if
we have additional views, not only dissenting views, and if
I sense what is going along here, I think that we are very close
to achieving unanimity, with the understanding that there may
be additional views, if we try to go through this thing section
by aeckion, having known the Senators for a number of years --
this should not be taken amiss -- but we will never get there.

The Chairman. We will never get there.

Mr. Lombard. So what I would like to suggest is that we
permit the report to lie on the table, so to speak, for four
or five days so that the reading and:objections to the actual
cases could be made, and I do not think there will be many of
those. I do not think you will get much of that. And then
have a meeting on the findings and recommendations, and at
that time the Senators could voice objections. or amendments to
the findings and conclusions.

The Chairman. What do you have to say about that, Mr.
Schwarz?

Mr. Schwarz. Suppose as a suggestion additionally to that,
that there be . day certain for having amendments in writing,

which will give a little time to focus on them, not just have them

TOP-SECRET : |

The Chairman. We could flag certain things which we think
ought to be called to the special attention of the Full asia le
I would be glad to do that. °

Senator Hart. (Colorado). And presume everything else is

non-controversial unless some individual Senator on the Full

 

Committee raises it.

The Chairman. Mr. Lombard?

Mr. Lombard. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if I coulda suggest
this from the staff point of view. If the Senators might not
have three or four days to read the document themselves -- now,
as you recall, it was not ready prior to the adjournment, and
the mechanics of getting it together were just too much -- I
think this might move along a lot more quickly if we allowed a
few days for each Senator and designee to read the entire
report, on the textual part. I am not talking about the
findings and recommendations; and to submit within that period
any suggested changes, and then have a plenary session of the
Committee on the findings and recommendations.

The Chairman. Let me see, Mr. Lombard, if I understand
you correctly, that suggestions with respect to the change in
the textual part --

Mr. Lombard. Would be made during the reading period.

The Chairman. Would be made during the reading period.

Mr. Lombard. And incorporated, if possible.

The Chairman. And incorporated if possible.

to be the final judge. It is expected that if any Senator
does not like the result of the treatment of such proposals,
it could be covered in separate views.

(3) With respect to the other sections, a plenary
session of the Committee will be held commencing Wednesday,
October 29, for the purpose of considering any proposed
written amendments. Any such proposed amendments should
be submitted to [the undersigned] by the end of the day
Monday so as.to permit the staff to organize and analyze
the proposals.

We will send you shortly a schedule indicating the

staff members who are particularly knowledgeable about the
various chapters in the text or countries/plots sections.

These persons are available for questions or other assistance.

available in the full book for the Committee.

Then tomorrow we have hearings in the morning and in the

afternoon as well because of Helms. So, the Full Committee shouk<

take this up Thursday. We will be free Thursday afternoon.

Mr. Miller. Yes.

The Chairman. For this purpose?

All right, why do we not begin the Full Committee's
consideration on Thursday afternoon?

Senator Hart (Colorado). Mr. Chairman, are you seeking
opinions on how to proceed?

The Chairman. Yes.

Senator Hart (Colorado). What if we had an agenda of
controversial items; that is to say, there is either division
at the staff or Subcommittee level, and just attack it that way?

The Chairman. I think as far as the Subcommittee is
concerned, when we complete our work, we will not have any
divisions.

Senator Hart (Colorado). All right. Or flagging.

The Chairman. We have some things to flag, yes, some
things to flag which we can --

Senator Hart (Colorado). And then leave it to individual
members to flag anything else.

The Chairman. The Subcommittee will be united on its
report, and the staff is united on the report.

Senator Hart (Colorado). That is what I meant with flag.
