Analysis of the rough draft map by Dr. SANTONI
was inconclusive, but a rough guess by him indicated the
possible location of many guard posts at intersections in
Ciudad Trujillo. Dr. SANTONI advised that hundreds of these
guard posts are located throughout the Dominican Republic and
manned by TRUJILLO's soldiers who stop and search every
vehicle that passes. ; ‘

Dr. SANTONI advised that a well-known Dominican
businessman whom he knows personally to be opposed to the
Trujillo Regime had recently arrived in Philadelphia for
treatment by Dr, SANTONI at St. Joseph's Hospital.

on 4/x0/61 Dr. SANTONI stated that after a
discussion with his patient from the Dominican Republic,
he ascertained that Maquinas de Diversiones C. par A. was
expanding its operations both in Ciudad: Trujillo and other
towns throughout the Dominican Republic. He advised that
his source told him that the company was building new
headquarters near Independencia Park néar the former
Presidential Hotel. The source further advised that
additional buildings were being constructed by this com-
pany on Mercedes Street and Palio Hincado. Dr. SANTONI
stated his source told him that the company was building
a new office in the Casa Blanca section, which is located
in the poor neighborhood of Ciudad Trujillo on Braulio

‘Alvarez Street. SANTONI's source advised him that the
main headquarters for the company were located on Calle
Tsabel La Catolica, and that all slot machines in the
Dominican Republic are repaired at this location.

Dr. SANTONI stated that both he and his source
were of the opinion that Dictator TRUJILLO encouraged this
company to expend in order to increase their own personal
revenues by taking a larger cut of the profits. Dr.
SANTONI advised that he would discreetly attempt to
obtain additional information concerning this company and
its officers through his sources in the Dominican Republic

Underground.

whowas formerly a leader in e@ main nH Republic Under-
ground, advised SA EDWARD A, SMITH Chat “all $1 6¢~inachine
operations in the Dominican Republic must be personally
approved by VIRGILLO ALVAREZ PENA, the uncle of Generalissimo
RAFAEL TRUJILLO, SANTONI stated that in order for a foreign
company to operate in the Dominican Republic, it is necessary
to "kick back" to the government anywhere from 30% to 60%
of the profits, SANTONI advised that Maquinas de Diversiones
Cc. par A, is the leading distributor and sole operator of
slot machines in the Dominican Republic.

SANTONI advised that he was not personally
acquainted with NORMAN FROMKIN, but that in the summer of
1960, an individual from this company assisted him in
repairing his car when it broke down in front of the company's
headquarters on Calle Isabel La Cattolica. SANTONI described
this individual as a large, heavy-set, balding American
with blond hair who constantly smoked cigars. During the
course of the conversation, SANTONI learned that this
individual had an apartment near the Marian Hospital,
Ciudad, Trujillo, and that he was married and had at
least one child. It is not known if this individual is
identical with FROMKIN.

On the reverse side of the above-mentioned
stationery was a roughly sketched map and Spanish names which
the informants believed were written by a non-Spanish individual.
Analysis of the handwriting reflected the names to be the
following cities in the Dominican Republic:

Santiago, San Francisco de Macoris, La Vega
Barahona, Puerto Plata, Casa Blanca, Independencia.

It should be noted that the word arcade or
casino arcade is written after some of these names. Dr.
SANTONI advised that a large amusement park in Ciudad
Trujillo is Independencia, which is controlled by the
TRUJILLO family.
