Reference Havana letters dated May 27, 1958.

@a duly 21, 1958, PCI Avthur\ Newman (conceal), Credit
Manager of the gambling casine at the Hotel Nacional, advised that
inquiry by him has failed to develop any information that the
MANNARINGS presently have aay gambling interests in Cuba. Source
said that sometime ago SAM MANNARING told him that he had lost a
large sum of money in Cuba in the. old Sans ‘Souci Night Club operation
and: that he had ne intention of ihvesting more money in gambling
eperations in Cuba in the near future. Source noted that in the
pact the MANNARINOS have shipped slot machines to Cuba. Source
believed that most of these shipments have been through ALBERTO
ARDUBA MGYA. Source noted that ARDURA is the “bag man" for :
ROBERTO FERNANDES MIRANDA, the brother-in-law of Cuban President,
FULGENCIG BATISTA. Source said that since FERNANDEZ MIRANDA receives \
50% of the “take* from 211 slot machines operating in Cuba, ARDURA 4
usually is the individual to whom slot machines are experted from
the United States. Source said this is done by ARDURA to insure
‘control of the slot machines.
