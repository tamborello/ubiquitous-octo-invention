2 Mr. Edgar. On our visit with James Earl Ray the security

3 | question was part of their concern about bringing James Earl Ray

 

@ 4 | before our committee. I think you would have to agree that we
5 | have to make that decision that he is going to come before hearing
6 | the specific witnesses who would tell how secure that security is.
7 | Do you understand what I am saying? If they are willing to not
8 | Listen to the security issues first before passing these resolu-
9 | tions, it makes some sense but I got the impression that one of
10 | the reasons we decided not to make the decision to offer the
1 invitation was that there were questions about security.
12 - Chairman Stokes. Mr. Sawyer.
13 Mr. Sawyer. I am totally open on the thing, Bob, because I
14 | would like to hear what they are going to do security wise,Peeause’?
15 | ZT am concerned about it but I don't need to put the cart pefore tht
16 || horse or the horse before the cart@ jt does not make any differ-

a

17 | ence.

 

18 Chairman Stokes. I think I feel the same way. I just want

19 || to have on record all matters relating to the security but I. don't

21 Mr. Fithian. Well, to do the whole thing expeditiousiy, I
e@ 22 | withdraw my suggestion.

23 Mr. Edgar. If there is agreement between counsel and Mr.
24 Stokes,. then I would move that we pass the resolution authorizing

Gf Chairman Stokes. Now, you were asking that we consider all
three en bloc.

Mr. Blakey. In the interest of time, they are interrelated
and could be passed en bloc although I notice that the second
resolution for the release of information in connection with the
up and coming hearings applies both to King and Kennedy. It is,
nevertheless, basically a technical resolution.

Mr. Edgar. If I may make one point before we move on that
issue. I had made the suggestion to our fhairman and to Bob
Blakey and perhaps we should discuss it before we have a final
vote on the resolution and that is that we might consider changing
a previous decision that we had made to interrogate Mr. Ray only
from nfne o'clock to ewbifve o'clock on the first tyo days and then
eit t hours on the enida day. In line with some of the security
concerns I was making the suggestion that we try to get the inter-
views over in the first typ days, perhaps doing the cross examina-
tion over two days, the 16th and 17th, holding the 18th as an
option day. If we finish on the 17th, Ray could be returned. If
we need the 18th, we could use it.

I think there is going to be a lot of pressure in terms of
legislative pressure and pressure to get out and the 18th may not
be the most receptive day to have the eifftchour session. Also,
if we did two 8*hour sessions, that would give us 16 hours. If
we do it as presently determined, we would have only 14 hours of

cross examination of Ray. I just think that the public and the

oy .

6 Chairman Stokes. Without objection, we will consider the

= ———— K
7 | three resolutions en bloc.
8 Does the committee desire to talk with the persons who will

9 | provide security? I had asked Mr. Blakey to make those indivi-

 

10 | @uals available so that if you have questions we might pose those
-11 | questions to those persons who will have direct custody over Mr.

15 Mr. Fithian. Mr. Chairman, I am all in favor of hearing that|

16 | although I think my own personal priority for this committee,
17 | having gotten this very, very late start, is to discuss the press
18 | policy first in the event that the committee does not hold together

19 | long anough to do everything. I would like to have that taken

it to apply to the court for an order conferring immunity upon

Mr.: Preyer (presiding). The committee will come to order.

The matters under discussion today are to be matters that
would be more properly discussed in a closed session,I understand.

Mr. Blakey. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Preyer. Do I hear a motion that this session be closed?-

Mr. Dodd. I so' move.

Mr. Preyer. Mr. Ratner wanted to take one picture before we

went into closed session. Ask him if he would come in, in a great

Gf Mr. Edgar. Mr. Chairman, are we going to be permitted to
have members of our staff in today's session for the issues that
are not related to secret information?

Mr. Blakey. There is only one part of the subject matter,
Mr. Chairman, that probably ought not to include members of the
staff and that will probably be later this afternoon.

Mr. Preyer. All right.

Mr. Chairman, I move that the session be clesed in accordance
with our rules and the regulations of the House.

Chairman Stokes. The motion having been properly made that
our committee go into executive session at this time, the clerk
will call the roll. :
