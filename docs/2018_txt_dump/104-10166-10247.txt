ancther source. On 19 February ise EMM IKCE/I. said he had just
received-a letter, from bis wails essistant in Haiti, ssying that
George de Mohrensehildt had sold his stockpile of sisal to the Polish ©
Copnercias Representative in Port-esuePricce, He remarked thst,02 |
de Mohrenschildt would be greatly relieved ef that burdea. (EV INCE/E
also wported that on i February, while exploring for s source of
fresh water ia southera Haiti, de Mehrenschildt discovered bauxite
near Pestel. de Mohreaschildt estisated that thers are 14,000,000
tons in that area. Considering the fact that bausite sells. for
$i$ to $28 a ten, that deposit could have @ substantial influence om
the economy of the country. In Merch 1964 the Reynolds “ining
Corporation was exporting shout 270,000 metric tons of ore snaually - ‘
from the deposit st Niragosne. ‘Tt fs assumed. thet de uohrenschilde : f

will do acthing about this find uatil he is assured of his pere
eentege and probably mer uacil the deposit at Mivagosae has been
exhausted. :

° ndefinite ac this potat and because of the inportance of keeping
VRINCE/E perfectly “elean,” this iaformstion is not for dissenination.
0 pyaruce/? ig sure that de Mohrenschildt has not told anyone else of
his discovery and hnowledge,of that deposit would be funediately
greceable to INCE/2. GRYMTNCE/ has axnrosced his intense dislike
of men he cannot complete } trust and a slip et this tise would
— effect the presently goed operational relationship with him.
