document. CIA no. 1818 indicates that CI Staff has completed a :

'xeview of the files of 117 US persons who had "defected" to

the USSR between 1959 and '63 and since returned to the United
States. Is that correct? °58 to '63?

Mr. Tovar. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. I wou.d like you to review the statement
under the name Thomas Morr:.dian.M-~O-R-R-I-D-I-A-N. While you
read that paragraph, I wilt. state for the record thst the way
the memo is sét forth it indicates that it was not standard
operating procedure to deb:-ief such individuals, that of 117
people whose files were reviewed only ten were debriefed.
Then it proceeds to list the ten individuals who in fact were
debriefed.

I have now requested lir. Tovar to read the first summary
which is right next to the name of the first person who was
debriefed.

Mr. Tovar. Yes sir.

Mr. Goldsmith. When’ dia that individual defect?

Mr. Tovar. 1947 is. the -year"heiwent te ‘the USSR. I
assume that is the year he defected, if that is the term.

Mr. Goldsmith. So that in fact that individual was not
someone who defected between 1958 and 1963?

| Mr. Tovar. That is correct.
Mr. Goldsmith. Let us look at the next individual under
