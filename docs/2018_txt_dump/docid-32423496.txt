April or early May the CIA supplied a variety of military equip-
ment to Verona as part of the reward for his participation.

[ AS HARVEY WAS REPORTING TO HELMS REGULARLY AS HE SAYS, IS IT
LIKELY HE WOULD HAVE TOLD HELMS ABOUT THIS? ] In May Harvey was
told the pills were in Cuba at a restaurant reportedly used by
Castro. (At this point Verona was still using the chef plan).
June 21 Harvey was told Verona had dispatched a three-man team to
Cuba, who would attempt to kill Castro if an opportunity presented
itself to use. the pill.

In September Verona indicated he was infiltrating three more
men who were former Cuba militia men who would try to penetrate ~
Castro's body-guard. (These men apparently did not actually leave
Florida, but Harvey gave Verona $2700 for this three-man team's

expense.) Thereafter the arrangements were gradually broken off.

April. when Harvey briefed Helms on Roselli that he obtained Helms'

approval not to brief McCone.

(4) April/May 1963. Helms approves Harvey's meeting with
Roselli as a kind of "close-out" of the Roselli relationship.

FBI has Roselli under surveillance -- calls Harvey and says they
must tell Hoover -- Harvey calls Helms -- Helms says no need to
brief McCone. Note: Senator Church may view this as another indi-
cation of Helms acting on his own.

poison and proposes a scheme regarding an exploding seashell.

never got anywhere. While this may be true as to the latter, the

Paris to meet Cuban asset Cubella. Cubella wants to assassinate
Castro. Documents indicate that Helms tells Fitzgerald he may
use the Attorney General's name without seeking approval from
Kennedy. . ,

to whether Cubella accepts it or not.

Note: This again be used to argue no executive approval.

Helms will state that he always felt that he was carrying out
Presidential directives and never operating on his own oF without
authority. .

as to McCone, Helms will say that he never felt it necessary
to brief him on any of the details but (I think) that, if pressed,
“he will say that he felt that McCone was aware that there was an

ongoing program to remove Castro without any limitations as to
means. Helms says he realizes that McCone now appears to be taking

a."somewhat higher" position on this matter.

_Helms also said that the "extreme pressure" to get rid of Castro

persisted all the way through 1963 but seemed to let up after the
assasSination of President Kennedy in November 1963. Helms will
say, however, that we were still "picking"-at him in the post-'63
period. He slips and slides when queried on what "picking" means
but, if pressed, he; will, I believe, say that this could include
someone knocking him off..

Attorney General Kennedy meeting and memorandum.

_ Attorney General Kennedy was briefed by Houston and Edwards on
7 May 1962 regarding the so-called First Phase of the assassination
attempt. Sheffield Edwards states that Kennedy was briefed "all
_ the way." Kennedy is reported to have told them that if CIA was
going to use gangsters in the future that they should check with
him first. He did not say do not engage in any. assassination pro-

gram.

This meeting is complicated by a 14 May 1972 memorandum (which
is in your folder). It describeds the 7 May meeting in terms of
obfuscation, avoiding any discussion of "assassination." I view
this as clearly a cover memorandum -- Senator Church will probably
view it as an indication that Kennedy did not approve or mow about

the assassination. program.

Interesting Note: Helms recalls that the State Department had
aman engaged in a full-time effort to try and arrange a group to

take over the government of Cuba upon the assassination of Castro.

Post-1961 Specific Phase II Operations.
(1) On 18 April 1962 poison pills were delivered by CIA Dr...

Triecher to Harvey to be sent into Cuba. Later memoranda indicate
that these pills were actually sent to Cuba. Additionally, memo-
randa indicate that the pills were ‘tin place" ready for the attempt.

. (2) Guns and explosives were given by Harvey and JMWAVE Chief
Shackley to Cuban asset Verona at a cost of $5,000.

(3) In June of 1962 and later in September documents. indicate
that three-man teams were sent into Cuba by Harvey's operatives for
assassination attempts. Indeed, in December 1962/January 1963 a
$2700 payment was made by Harvey to Verona for expenses of the

three-man teams.

RICHARD HELMS

 

Helms' testimony will be that in early 1961. he was "briefed"
‘on the so-called Phase I assassination scheme to remove Castro.

He thinks he was briefed by Harvey rather than by Bissell, but
acknowledges such briefing, although he is unclear as to the details.

Helms says that there was an ongoing requirement on the Agency
and indeed a government- -wide operation (Project MONGOOSE) to
remove Castro. -) Helms says that there were ''no limitations" ever
put on the methods which would be acceptable to remove Castro, e.g.
if pressed he will agree that assassination is one such acceptable
method. Therefore, on the issue of authority, Helms will say that
because he felt that there was an ongoing presidentially-authorized
program to remove Castro, he did not seek any specific approval
from either McCone, Attorney General Kennedy, or any one else in
the White House when he "took over" the Harvey operation to remove
Castro.

Helms will, however, make every effort to downplay anything
that occurred after he was "briefed". and "took over" (as DDP) the
responsibility: from Bissell for this operation. While Helms
acknowledges that he did approve Harvey! s contact with Roselli,’
he will say that he viewed Roselli as an experimental contact who
would probably not amount to any concrete action. Helms will
dismiss the post-1962 schemes as harebrained proposals which were
made by lower-level employees with over-active imaginations and
that he considered them proposals rather than definite assassina-

tion plans.
