eration, Legat. has been, able to reply to Bureau requests
in a prompt manner. Gu

At. the present time Dr. MANOPULO has. placed
‘stops for BRUNO at all airports and.seaports in Italy.
All police districts have been alerted and re-alerted
‘py telegram and have. been instructed to immediately
telephone. Dr, MANOPULO should information. regarding
BRUNO's whereabouts be obtained. Particular investiga-
tive attention is being given by Italian Police in
Caltanisetta, Mosciano St. Angelo, and. the small. com-
munities surrounding Mosciano-St. Angelo.’ In this. re-
gard,.Legat has also arranged for Italian Police at
Rome's Fiunicino Airport .to immediately contact him at
_the office or home if BRUNO should prepare to travel to
the United States by air. G@-))()

Department of State concérning this matter. We-are
following with DAMRON and will keep .the: Bureau advised

tion of JAMES M,..SALVATORE, reportedly in Rome to give
