SUBJECT: Review of Mexico City Station Files
at the Warrenton Record's Center

1. On_2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture
visited thi_—___ Records Center to review old Mexico
City files in Séarch of additional photographs of the
“unidentified man". We were unable to locate any such
photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have
been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and
that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters

for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed
and pertinent notations re re-use of the old folders:
