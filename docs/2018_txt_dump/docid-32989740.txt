Attention: “Mr. Robert L. Keuch

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with the investigation by this Committee
into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr.,.it is requested that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation assist this Committee by providing us with
certain material.

The attached memorandum refers to a racial conference
which was held at FBI Headquarters in early 1968. Counter-
intelligence proposals directed at Martin Luther King were
apparently disucssed at that conference.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations requests
that we be provided with all documents in existence per-
taining to such conference and any action taken, as a result
thereof. Your response should also include any documents
relating to the scheduling of the conference.

Your earliest attention to this matter would be greatly
appreciated.
