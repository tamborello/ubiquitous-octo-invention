ARE LOADED ABOARD PLANE DOOR WILL BE CLOSED AND PLANE WILL TAX! TO AIR STRIP
AND TAKE OFF.

2, CHANCES OF STOPPING AND INTERROGATION SLIGHT. WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN
WOULD BE THAT AMCLATTER=1 WOULD BE RECOGNIZED BY AN OFFICIAL WHO ALSO 1S AWARE
THAT HE 1S BEING SOUGHT. THIS COULD ONLY TAKE PLACE DURING THE APPROXIMATELY
15 MINUTE PERIOD THAT AMCLATTER-1 WOULD BE DRIVING ‘CAR FROM ODUNIT ATTACHE
RESIDENCE TO PLANE SIDE. ALIBI WOULD BE THAT AMCLATTER+-1 HAD ONLY A FEW DAYS
BEFORE APPLIED TO EMBASSY FOR JOB AS CHAUFFEUR AND WAS BEING TRIED OUT ON
PROBATIONARY PERIOD. ODUNIT ATTACHE WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FOR WEEK COULD CLAIM NEVER
TO HAVE‘SEEN HIM BEFORE AND MERTON WOULD GIVE THE ALIBI WHICH AMCLATTERS1 WOULD
SUPPORT. SINCE IT NOT PUBLICLY KNOWN THAT AMCLATTER+1 1S WANTED BY AUTHORITIES

;

 

ODACID COULD HARDLY BE CRITICISED FOR CONSIDERING HIM FOR EMPLOYMENT AS A CHAUFFEUR.
3. IF AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO ACTUAL TAKE OFF IT APPEARS UNWISE TO PROCEED WITH
EXFILTRATION PLAN DUE TO PRESENCE OF CUBAN OFFICIALS AT PLANE SIDE OR FOR ANY
OTHER REASON, AMCLATTER=1 WILL CONTINUE PLAY PART OF CHAUFFEUR AND AFTER PLANE
TAKE OFF DRIVE ODUNIT ATTACHE CAR BACK TO ODACID BUILDING.
kh, IT §S SINCERE BELIEF OF COS THAT CHANCES OF COMPROMISE ARE MOST REMOTE. .
