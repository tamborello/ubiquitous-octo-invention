ization SECRECY AGREEMENT or in an Organization debriefing, oral or written, I
acknowledge that should I again be affiliated with another government agency or
department, I will preserve the secrecy of intelligence operations, sources, and

partments, even though such persons are fully cleared for Top Secret, or are in
possession of any other type of security clearance, within their own departments.

2. I further affirm that I will not discuss with or disclose to any government
employee, foreign service officer, or other official with whom I may later be asso-
ciated, any information relating directly to clandestine operations, sources. or
methods, personnel or fiscal figures of the Organization, or to special operations,
security measures, or other matters which may have been acquired by reason of ny
assignment with the Organization unless by permission of the Chief of the Organ-
ization or his authorized representative.

3. Should any question arise under this agreement or should I desire permission
hereunder, I will communicate with the Organization Security Office for advice
and guidance.

ther understand that this agreement is for my benefit as well as that of the Or-
