PCI Williamson previously
notified our New York Office
telephonically with respect to
fight in Cal-Neeva Lodge between
Giancana and Victor Collins,
bodyguard-business manager,
employed by Williamson to accompany
his wife Dorothy McGuire. New York
has been instructed not to contact
Williamson for purpose requested
as it would likely expose
Williamson as informant. Las Vegas
will be instructed to furnish
lead=-type information to
Gaming Contrél Board for assistance
in their investigation.
