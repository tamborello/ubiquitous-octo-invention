COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

   

 

 

   

Although this employee is a fine intelligence officer end has worked
very hard for the Chief of Station, Mexico City, I consider the reting
of Outstanding in ell specific @uties and for over-all performance to be
excessively high. Reporting on the activities she supervises has been
as good as thet from other Mexico City cperations but is still not up
to DDP stendar@és. While most of the projects ‘she, is concerned with are
hendled with proper cost consciousness, at least: Que of them, the LITEMPO
Project,is not. The agents. are paid too mich and “their activities are
not adequately reported. Bis! has been called tot the station's ettention.
