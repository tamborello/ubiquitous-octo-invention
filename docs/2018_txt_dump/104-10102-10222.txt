Ee A New View on Splitting | the Regime:
; 1.. Castro’ 8 purge of Escalante surfaced his
. concern for the balance. between the hon-communist ,
@lements of the 26th of July Movement and the
"unaligned" government leader and the PSP ~ "old"
and "new",
2.. To split Castro from the PSP would be difficult
and of questionable value: .
a. The PSP to gain its final objective would
take any insult and tura the other cheek.
“It hed embraced Fidel and would not let go
under any circumstances. To rise against
Castro now would not be opportune, and
would probably be fatal,
i . ; . b. Fidel was now totally dependent on the
Soviet Union
¢. The only hope was not to split Fidel fron
PSP but to identify, at every opportunity,
him and his government with communism, for
only the non-communist element of the 26th

of July Movement and the "unaligned leaders

t

 
 

 

of the government could effectively be —
split. ‘from. the government. —
8. This conclusion did not preclude the Task
Force from attempts to create suspicion,

hostility and. friction between Castro and

: "the PSP...

tr.) The Direction of Task Foroé Efforts to Split the Regine:

“A. To identify those members of the 26th of July Movement

and other "unaligned" government leaders who were for

i the revolution but against communism. To date, there

is reasonably ‘good. evidence indicating that the

following individuals do not approve of the communist

direction of the Cuban revolution and may in fact

be conspiring against the regime,
