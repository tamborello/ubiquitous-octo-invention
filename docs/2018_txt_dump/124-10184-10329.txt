It is noted that BURROS is the subject of

New York file 137-9462. This file was opened in January,
1963, at which time consideration was given to developing

him as a Source of Information. In March, 1963, the
file on BURROS was closed, however, it was pointed out
in New York letter to the Bureau concerning the American
National Party (BUfile 157-537) that the New York Office
would continue to accept whatever information BURROS

wished to voluntarily furnish.
