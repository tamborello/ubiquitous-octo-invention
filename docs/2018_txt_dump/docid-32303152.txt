able newspaper publicity, that MEROIA realized that the

weapons had been stolen from a National Guard Armory in

Canton, Ohio. MEROLA later learned from a source he could not..-
recall that the burglary of the armory was committed by :
GEORGE FLOREA and RICHARD STEWART, with help from a “inside f.
man," arid that the guns had been stored in the beer. distribu- | -
torship owned by VIC CARLUCCI in Arnold, Pa. RED GIORDANO,

who was convicted in this case merely because it was proven

he had bought some burlap bags and the weapons, when found,

had been wrapped in burlap bags, actually had nothing to do

with the case. ANDY MANGINI, who was never brought into the
case, actually helped load and unload the guns from CARLUCCI's
beer distributorship to the truck and from the truck to the
airplane. : .

 

   

 

 

‘Lottery

PIERS PENTEL EI ESE OTE

HYMEN MARTIN, aka, PIVHSBURGH HYMIE, wsed to have the distributor-
ship in Western Pennsylvania of the Empire Treasury lottey
tickets, and since he was friendly with the. MANNARINOs, they
allowed his ticket to be sold at their numbers outlets in and

_ near New Kensington, Pa. HYMIE MARTIN, with whom MEROLA became
friendly when MEROLA was a used car. salesman in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
was the one who first introduced MEROLA to the MANNARINOs, in
approximately 1954. MARTIN, who now resides in Miami, Florida,
probably turned over the distributorship of the Empire Treasury
lottery ticket to his brother, NATE MARTIN, who is still in.
the Pittsburgh area. .

The MANNARINO gambling casino in New Kensington, Pa., operates

“. Pittsburgh, which means that gamblers in Squirrel Hill are
transported from that section to New Kensington for the pur-
pose of gambling. Routine employees at the gambling casino
receive $150 per week flat, and those in charge receive the
_. $150 weekly salary plus a small percentage of the net take.

-- ¢ Tt has been curious in the past to note that whenever they so
: desire, KELLY MANNARINO or SAM MANNARINO would walk into the

‘gambling casino and demand that the cashier give them a sum
“of money. For instance, SAM MANNARINO might tell the cashier

to give him $1,000 and not to tell KELLY MANNARINO at the
-. pisk of being killed. Employees at the easino do not carry
weapons generally, but m:.occasions, when there is a rumor that
_ the casino may be robbed, everybody, including the MANNARINOs,
goes about town fully armed. ; ;

During the long period of time, in excess of one year, that
KELLY MANNARINO was hiding to avoid service of subpoenas, .
- commencing in December of 1957, he stayed at two places:.

at the parish house of Mount Saint Peters Roman Catholic

New Kensington, Pa., Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK and the majority
of his City Council have been "owned" by the MANNARINOs, since

‘Gun-running

- Although the Federal Government was not able to prove it,
- there is no question that SAMUEL’ MANNARINO was part of the
conspiracy in 1958 to run guns from New Kensington, Pa., to
Cuba.

 

Originally the’ plans to take guns to Cuba were JOSEPH MEROLA'S
plans, and the guns were scheduled to go to FIDEL CASTRO. In
the summer of. 1958, AL ROSS told MEROLA that he could obtain
M-l rifles and carbines. MEROLA met ROSS at the Warwick Hotel,
New York City, and gave ROSS $4,000 as part payment for the
guns, which money MEROLA had received from CARLOS PRIO..
MEROLA was to return to the Warwick Hotel with additional
-. money in a day-or so and did so, but AL ROSS did not show up. -
--. After MEROLA returned to Miami, Florida, MEROLA learned from
*. Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO, Miami Springs, Florida, that SAM MANNARINO .
-. was interested in purchasing an Apache airplane. Because :
-.. MEROLA is a pilot and acquainted with airplaneg, he looked
‘- over the prospective plane with Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO and
advised Dr. PESSOLANO that the airplane was too defective.
-.. After that, MEROLA assisted Dr. PESSOLANO to lease a Twin
.; Beech airplane from a company owned by HAL DUPONT, Miaml1,
“-- Blorida, When Dr. PESSOLANO told MEROLA that MANNARINO intended
- to use the airplane to fly guns to Cuban dictator BATISTA, he
-- pealized that these were the guns that had been promised to
“him and that he was being double-crossed. MEROLA then apranged
- with Dr. PESSOLANO for MEROLA to accompany the pilot, STUART
. SUTOR, on the first flight to Pittsburgh, for the sole purpose
of contacting SAM MANNARINO and asking him about the double-
cross. After SUTOR and MEROLA landed at Aliegeny Airport,
Pittsburgh, they took a cab to MEROLA's sister's house in the
. Regent Square section of Pittsburgh and borrowed her car,
.. They drove to the Tour-Tel Motel on U. S. Route 22, Monroeville,
' where they registered for the night. MEROLA and SUTOR then
traveled to New Kensington, where MEROLA. attempted to locate
SAM MANNARINO. MEROLA was unable to locate SAM MANNARINO, s0
he went to Wilmerding, Pa., to. the house of "Sarge" BOTTI, -
-where KELLY MANNARINO was hiding from the service of subpoenas.
_KELLY MANNARINO stated that he knew nothing of the plan to
smuggle guns to Cuba, that this was one of SAM * MANNARINO's
"hare-brained" schemes, and that he wanted nothing to do with
it. MEROLA then returned to Miami, Florida, by way of Eastern
Airlines, It was not until the pilot, STUART SUTOR, was

phases of thé MANNARINO-controlied slot and pinball machines.
NORMAN ROTHMAN

NORMAN ROTHMAN has represented the MANNARINOs in their Cuban
and some Florida interests for many years. ROTHMAN, like all
other MANNARINO employees, steals from them, and when the
MANNARINOs have lost money in an investment, such as the Sans
Souci Gambling Casino, Havana, Cuba, which ROTHMAN fronted for
them, ROTHMAN always emerges with money. ROTHMAN's Cuban
connections are over-rated and when anything actually difficult
is to be accomplished in Cuba, ROTHMAN ordinarily needs the
assistance of JOSEPH%MEROLA, Currently, ROTHMAN has the
franchise for the cocktail bar in the Bel Aire Hotel, Miami (J
Beach, Florida, and his two sons are working at the bar. ROTH-
_ MAN is, like SAM MANNARINO, an addict to cocaine, which he
sniffs.- .

ABE SEID, aka, Al Ross

Although AL ROSS has the reputation «= -.:" of having killed
on many occasions, it is not believed that he deserves that
reputation. He has never been known to brag about any kill-
ings. ROSS, who is under order of deportation to his native
Russia, is worried that the U. S. Government will find some
nation which will accept him. ROSS 1s very much in love with
his wife, MORMA, who is a nymphomaniac currently residing on
Palm Island, Miami Beach, Florida. ROSS gives the appearance
of being a "tired old man," and he shows no enthusiasm for
taking part‘in any illegal activity to obtain money, even
though he is in serious financial straits.

JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA

_ JOHN FONTANA was once KELLY MANNARINO's bodyguard and most
trusted lieutenant. KELLY MANNARINO regarded FONTANA as his
‘protege and made hima "don," After FONTANA's marriage ahout
a year and a half ago, he and MANNARINO had a falling out.
FONTANA thought that he was not getting enough money and
complained to MANNARINO, who told him that he was getting all
he was going to get. FONTANA then made the serious mistake:
of going over KHLY MANNARINO's head and appealing to JOHN
LA ROCCA, who subsequently reported this to KELLY MANNARINO,
Since then FONTANA has been relegated to an unimportant. job
fronting the Marbet Heating Company store in New Kensington,
and he receives little or no income from the MANNARINO gant ing
activities. : . me

viewed at Room 201, Federal. Building, Miami, Florida, by — ‘
SA JOHN S. PORTELLA and SA THOMAS G, FORSYTH III in the —
presence of U. S. Department. of Justice. Attorneys WILLIAM .

“A, PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND
_Name Change :

No information has ever been received why the MANNARINO famil
name was legally changed from RUGGIERO to MANNARINO. o

  

“Marriage of GABRIEL MANNARINO ;

‘GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO's wife, JEAN, had no choice in her
selection of mate. The marriage was arranged between her
. father, FRANK AMATO, of Braddock, Pa., and KELLY MANNARINO,.

JOSEPH PETER MANNARINO, aka, JOJO _- Brother

“JOJO MANNARINO, who suffers from a palsy~like twitching and
‘from ‘severe Stammering, is a “nut" and “con man," He has

.dissipated the fortune of his wife, HAZEL, widow of motion
picture actor LEWIS STONE, in just a few years. KELLY and o
SAM MANNARINO allow JOJO to come to New Kensington occasionally.
on the conditbn that he "stays out of trouble, put JOJO always ~
does something to get into trouble, such as writing worthless °
checks, and is forced to leave town, After such visits to :
New Kensington, KELLY and/or SAM MANNARINO ordinarily make ©:
cod the amount of the worthless checks written by JOJO.

tember of the "outfit," by birth or by being "made." Whether
ene is pern inte eligipiiity for admission inte the "outfit"
or one is made eligible, the only way one can become finally.
accepted is by the commission of a murder. Every man who is
considered a "don without exception, has at some time or
another killéd someone. Once a man becomes a "don," the only
way he can cease being such and can leave the "outfit" 1s by
nis death. «The expression is used that "the door opens only
one way." “

In approximately the middle 1950's, KELLY MANNARINO took a
great liking to JOSEPH MEROLA and on several occasions told
friends that he "was making" MEROLA into a "don," On one
occasim, KELLY MANNARINO took MEROLA to New York City with
him where he introduced MEROLA tio VITO GENOVESE and MIKE
MIRANDA, at which time KELLY told them he was making MEROLA
into a "don." On another occasion, KELLY MANNARINO gave
MEROLA a pakage and told him to deliver it to New York City
without opening it, .and when JOE MEROLA had delivered. the
package in New York City and, it was opened, it was found to
contain only cut up newspaper. MEROLA was put. to other tests,
such as arrests by the New Kensington, Pa., Police Department

“all of which were designed to test him to see if he could be

trusted and would remain silent, Because of this experience
with KELLY MANNARINO, MEROLA became aware that all of the top
leaders, both Nationdly and locally, of racketeering ae of
Italian extraction and are known to each other as "dons."

Some of the "dons" in the Pittsburgh, Pav, area are:
