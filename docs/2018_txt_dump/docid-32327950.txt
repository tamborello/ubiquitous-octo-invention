On numerous occasions during he summer of 1963, NY 3936-C
advised 8A WILLIAM A, VERICKER that FRANK MC GUIRE is
endeavoring to erect a boys'camp and health resort in
Greenwood Lake, NY. NY 3936-C further stated that
HERSERT ITKIN, an attorney, and the subject are assisting
MC GUIRE in an endeavor to to obtain a mortgage for this
establishment.

In view of the closeness of the informant to this
matter, it is felt that nothing would be gained from an
interview of either GRANELLO or ITKIN and might possibly
compromise this informant.

The file of the NYO Division failed to reflect any
information identifiable with JAY ROSENBLATT, 446 West S5th
St., NYC, King and Barnes, 1400 2nd Ave,, NYC or VINCENT VOLPE,

The current telephone directories for the Greater Miami,

Florida area, reflect that JE 8-8716 is listed to the Bolivar
Hotel, 740 Ocean Drive, Miami Beach, Fla. It is not believed
practicable to attempt to determine "what individual at the

Bolivar Hotel was called from the telephone of NANCY GRANELLO.

The infomation rediived.from the Southern Bell Telephone
and Telegraph Company, Miami Beach, Florida, was obtained
from Mrs. LORRAINE ETTER by IC ROBERT JOHN SCHAMAY.

On 8/19/63, AL 3050-PC was recontacted in regard to the

‘subject. The informant advised that three or four weeks

ago, he received a telephone call from JOIE KAUFMAN, in which

KAUFMAN told him that he was then at JIMMY BARONE's, Murray's

Inn, Fuller Rd., Colonie, NY. AL 3050-PC further stated

that he proceeded to Murray's Inn at which time he joined

KAUFHAN , GRANELLO and a dark cozplexioned good looking young

Italian, who was with GRANELLO and whose name was "Tony"

(last name unknown), The informant stated that KAUFMAN

identified "Tony" to him as GRANELLO's bodyguard. AL eae PC

further advised that <AUPMAN , GRANELLO, TONY and KAUFMAN'

wife had driven to Albany, NY, apparently because KAUPHAGE® s wife,
