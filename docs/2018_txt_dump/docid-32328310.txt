tion has been implemented by several informants in the Miami :
Division, as well as information from a confidential source.
\ who ‘advised in February, 1962, in the matter captioned "PROPOSE
\ MEETING OF CHICAGO HOODLUMS;, MIAMI DIVISION, FEBRUARY, 1962,"
that YARAS, along with JACK CERONE, Chicago top hoodlum, were
-given the primary responsibility in the proposed gangland execu-¢( \\
:tion of one FRANK ESPOSITO, of Chicago, then vacationing in very

    
 

Miami.
\ ¥YARAS is on constant travel status between Chicago and {|i
. Miami, and appears to make a visit to Chicago at least once p
month. -
