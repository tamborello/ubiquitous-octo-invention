Mr. J. Walter Yeagley
Assistant Attorney General

NOTE :

Our informant in this matter was Evelio Alpizar Perez
who was among those picked up by Customs. Alpizar was most cooperative
with our Miami Office and it was on basis of his information that
raid was thwarted. There is no need to advise the Department that
Alpizar was our informant at this time. If the Department indicates
willingness to prosecute we can consider advising Department of
identity of Alpizar at that time.
