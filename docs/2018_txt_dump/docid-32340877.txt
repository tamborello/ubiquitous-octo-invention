An analysis of the above_jinformation reflects
several obvious factual conflicts Dr. RIVAS VASQUEZ
advised in March, 1977, that one of the DISIP sources
had reported two meetings in the Dominican Republic in
June, 1976. A larger one, which was a political meeting,
and the smaller one, which was strictly operational, whose
purpose was to decide on terrorist activity against Cuba.
Among those present at the operatignal meeting, accordin ‘Ss
to the source, was GUILLERMO NOVO i 1337-S, who was é »)
also in attendance at the June, 1976, meeting, advised
that the meetings were held in the Dominican Republic
on June 11, 12, and 13, 1976, and that the representatives
from the Cuban Nationalist Movement were Dr. JUAN PULIDO
and JOSE DIONISIO SUAREZ, not GUILLERMO NOVO. Moreover,

MM 1337-S presented the conference more as one continuous
than as two separate meetings, but did advise that the
conference contained discussions of future terrorist

activities. COO ;

BOSCH, through BLAKE FLEETWOOD, confirmed that
the meeting had taken place in June of 1976 in the Dominican
Republic and had been attended by all of the military and
political directors of the different Cuban exile groups.
BOSCH also confirmed through the FLEETWOOD article that
CORU had been formed at that meeting, and that he himself
was the leader. (U)

MORALES in his statements confirmed that the
meeting had taken place and stated t it was only one of

advising that his information came throug SIP agent Cs

As can be seen from the above, several distinct
references were made to two meetings in the Dominican
Republic in June of 1976. They can either be interpreted
as two meetings at the same three-day conference or as a
continuous meeting over a period of several days, which
obviously involved more than one physical encounter of
attendees, which would thereby explain the apparent
conflict. This in fact was the original interpretation
| by the 00 as regards to the above point inasmuch-as MM-133
reported the presence of SUAREZ at the June , | 1976, meeting
and this was corroborated by another source; e 00 was
therefore persuaded to believe that in fact SUAREZ did

meetings that were held in Costa Rica in June, 1976.

(MORALES during the interview in fact said Costa Rica,

but it was evident from the rest of his conversation that

he meant the Dominican Republic). MORALES did not know

which specific meeting POSADA attended, but stated that
another Venezuelan had also been present and it was Dr.
AURELIO ALVAREZ ECHESARTI. Others present at the

CORU meeting as reported to MORALES, since he was not present,
were FRANK CASTRO, member of the FLNC, OSCAR ANGULO,FLNC,
ORLANDO BOSCH, Accion Cubana, JOSE DIONISIO SUAREZ ESQUIVEL,
one of the NOVO brothers representing MNC (Moviemento Nacional
Cubano). During one of these meetings, it was discussed that
CORU would not have any more actions in the U.S., but DIONISIO
SUAREZ was not in agreement because he said they already have

an operation going in 4H -S,, but they would be able to comply
after ninety days. : v)

attended the meeting as the representative from the CNM.
MORALES confirmed the presence at the meeting of ORLANDO BOSCH,
ROBERT CABALLO, and ARMANDO LOPEZ ESTRADA. MORALES further
stated that FRANK CASTRO had been the individual who had
organized the meeting, and that it had taken plaee with
the knowledge and blessing of the Government of the Dominican
Republic. POSADA also reported that all of the groups attending,
with the exception of the CNM, were in favor of confining any
actions against the Cuban Government to areas outside the
U.S. POSADA also reported that actions against the Cubana

Airlines were discugsed and that as a result, subsequent
actions were taken. & (

MORALES continued that on the evening of May 9, 1977,
he was talking to FRANK CASTRO, who is now residing in Miami,
Florida. MORALES stated that CASTRO advised him during
the telephone conversation that during the meeting, JOSE DIONISIO
SUAREZ had made the statement that the CNM had one contract with
the Chileans in the U.S., which stdll_had to be carried out,
and this was the LETELIER killing.

FLEETWOOD's article is a result of a four-hour
interview of ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA, who was at the time of the
interview incarcerated in Caracas, Venezuela, for his role
in the October, 1976, bombing by anti-CASTRO exiles of a
Cubana airliner plane, which cost the lives of some 73

ng in the Dominican Republic

regarding the June, 1976, meet¥
by anti-CASTRO Cuban exiles hy,

 

BOSCH's plotting culminated in a secret meeting of
the top terrorist leaders of the hemisphere in the Dominican
Republic. "The story of CORU (Coordination of the United
Revolutionary Organizations) is true," he told me. "There
was a meeting in the Bonao mountains of 20 men representing
all different (Cuban exile) activist organizations. It was a
meeting of all the military and political directors with
revolutionary implications. It was a great meeting.
Everything was planned there." (

The top men from Alpha 66 (New Jersey), Abdalah
(a New York-based youth group),. the 2506 Brigade (veterans
of the Bay 6f Pigs invasion), FLNC, F14 (New York City)
and Accion Cubana (a group BOSCH headed) met for two days
in the Bonao mountains in early June, 1976. They decided
to band together under an umbrella organization, COR’ with
BOSCH as the only identified spokesman and leader. KK,

"At last we had all the Cuban revolutionary
fighters and leaders together after 17 years. We decided
to upscale the action after that. We wanted to beat the
guy (CASTRO) or at least make his life impossible. I told
them that we couldn't just keep bombing an embassy here and
a police station there. We had to start taking more serious
actions-~hijacking." (According to a Cuban exile newspaper,
one of the resolutions that came out of that meeting. was a vow
“to begin attacking CASTRO's planes in the air.")

"I accepted the leadership of CORU because I wanted
to set everything up on an organized basis. We were tired
of being frustrated and not accomplishing everything that we
wanted to do.'' BOSCH brought the other leaders up-to-date
on the kind of help they could expect in Nicaragua, the
Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Chile. Then the group
dispersed. In the 11 months since that meeting, BOSCH
boasts, CORU has been responsible for over 50 bombings in
Miami, New York, Venezuela, Panama, Mexico, and Argentina.
(BOSCH refused to admit any personal involvement in bombings
within the United States; police sources say the leaders
had agreed not to take credit for actions within the_U.s.
because the FBI was putting too much heat on them.) (j

BOSCH then spoke of two countries which are not
friends of FIDEL CASTRO's Cuba. These are Chile and Costa

treatment to Cuban exiles by those countries. BOSCH specifically
mentioned that ROLANDO OTERO, a U.S. fugitive, was returned to

: AUSA EUGENE M. PROPPER ¢
e ~ "On March 9, 1977; Dr. RAFAEL..RIVAS. VASQUEZ,

Deputy- Direetor=DISIP, advtsed that in Jene, 1976, two
meetings were held in the Dominican Republic which were
attended by leaders of the principal Cuban exile organizations.
They had two meetings, the first one, and the larger of the
two, was a political meeting to agree on a political strategy
for the various exile Cuban groups. The other one, a much
smaller meeting, was strictly operational and was attended
by 6 people. Itsspurpose was to decide on terrorist activity
against Cuba. DISIP léarned from a source that the following
people attended the operational meeting: ORLANDO BOSCH,
GUILLERMO NOVO, LUIS POSADA, an unidentified representative
of the Brigade 2506, FRANK CASTRO and ARMANDO LOPEZ ESTRADA.
PROPPER volunteered that one of his sources identified
ROBERTO CARBALLO, present Head of ‘the Brigade 2506, as its
representative at the meeting. “According to RIVAS, a map

was marked up during the meeting, showing the various
divisions of responsibility. For example, POSADA's group

was assigned all of South America and the Caribbean was a
target of opportunity for all groups. Mr. PROPRER asked

who had..been assigned North America. RIVAS said he did not

‘know, but ‘that he hada copy of the-map.. PROPPER_asked for

a copy. of--the—-map-and—RIVAS agreed fo furnish it. PROPPER™
explained that he speculated that North America may have

been divided in two by a horizontal line, running across

the U.S. at the level of Washington, D.C. If so, the
territory north of the line may have been assigned to the NOVO
brothers, who worked primarily out of New Jersey (although

one of them, IGNACIO, actually lives in Florida); the Brigade _
me 2 BBSS been assigned North America south of Washington,

Subsequent to that meeting, said -RIVAS, POSADA's
group had carried out a number of operat#ons. These were:
bombing of the Air Panama office in Bogota (carried out by
LUIS POSADA, HERNAN RICARDO and OLEG GUETON RODRIGUEZ);
bombing of the Cuban office in Panama (RICARDO and curton) (S)
