Subjects Cuban Sugar
From: Le Mr. hayes L

A night's reflection on the problem of the Cuban sugar -
cargo now at San Juan has intensified my concern, rather
than abated it. I think the following points should be
brought to the attention of the President:

is. The potential gain from the operation is neglie
gible. Even if it results, as Mr. Johnson suggested, in
spoilage of $500,000 of sugar, this 1s perifberal in terns
of the bloc economic capacity.

2. The fact that the sugar has been treated will ale

‘most certainly be discovered, at the time of ultimate cone

sumption, if not before. At that time, chemical analysis
will be employed, and will, in all likelihood identify

the method that was used. Even if the matter cannot be

tied to any particular cargo, I think the USSR could and
would acouse the U.S. and with considerable plausibility
in world forums. After all, the technology involved is
quite complicated and is not llkely to be available to.
stevedores, crewmen and the like, unless made available to’
them from outside. The only alternative we could suggest
as the gouree of the action is the Cuban resistance move~
ment, Even if we were able to make this suggestion. stick,
the only result would be to discredit further the responsi«-
bility and bona fides of that movement. .

3. I have no confidence in the seientific judgment
that the substance is harmless. We know from recent ex«
perience that drugs which have been extensively tested for
human consumption turn out to have side effeots when widely
administered. I cannot believe that this substance has had
such extensive testing. The described effsots are such as
to suggest that the impact would not be uniform accross a
wide sample of the population. A good way to put this issue
in perspective is to ask how you would feel about the same
thing happening to yourself or your family, if the action
had been taken by the other side,

’. & It 4s wrong to contaminate food supplies.

I would very much like to be present when this matter is dis~

eussed with the President, unless you feel 4t would detract
from the presentation,
