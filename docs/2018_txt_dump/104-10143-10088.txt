AAGSSE \
L INTRODUCTIQ ‘A KV
agit:

The 201 system poiglhh WY for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Dh rate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 20] personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

  
  

2. THE 201 SYSTEM
The principal features of the 201- system are: .
a. The 201 Number: a unique number, ie., aren assigned to each

individual in the system to serve as ae fi AN ber for reporting on that
individual.

  
  

b. The 201 Dossier: the offi

coe \ SY i opening form (Form
' 831) and all biographi

re: wD the individual, ie., per-

p Gee WS generated by the opening of
a 201 file. This record produ Si Bes ter 201 reference for the Main Index and
Stores the pertinent informatidh-which may later be retrieved! for special listings.

“a. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref.
erence consolidated.

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.

f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on

names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
