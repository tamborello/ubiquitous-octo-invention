available to Newark, reproductions of D-1 and D-2 forms
‘filed by the Welfare Fund for the years 1959, 1962 and 1963
together with a report of Welfare Fund CPA,to Board of Trustees,
dated 4/23/63, insurance data regarding the Welfare Fund
plan and a complant form regarding instant Welfare Fund
complainant LLOYD THOMAS. THOMAS' complaint similar in
content with information he has previously furnished the
Newark Office.

; Reporting the results of an examination of the
above listed reenrds is held in abeyance pending tke proposed
examination of the Welfare Fund records, as its presentation
at that time will appear more logical.

AUSA MATTHEW P, BOYLAN,. Newark, N. J., on 8/9/63,
advised he had been telephonically contacted by one
JACK BAILLARD, an attorney for the Office of W & PP
who requested that he be advised as to the outcome of the
-FBI investigation in this matter.

On 8/12/63, AUSA BOYLAN advised further that
BAILLARD in his conversation of 8/9/63 had also indicated
that his (BAILLARD) office had previously received
complaints concerning withheld contributions to captioned
welfare fund.

CLIFFORD B, FINKLE, SR. on 7/26/63 advised
SA WILLIAM F, FLYNN (A) that’ the welfre fund has
subpoenaed records of PITC for review to establish amount due
to welfare fund in view of withheld contributions by PTTc.
He advised his attorney, JAMES BRESLIN, is handling this
matter. He further indbated it is their belief that this
is the initial step to effect collection of withheld welfare
contributions and expressed concern that the results of the
FBI investigation might become known to the welfare fund who
could use this information as a basis for a civil suit.

Mr, FINKLE, SR, was advised the report reflecting
the result of the FBI investigation will be made available
only to appropriate departments of the Federal Government.
