CLARK went on to advise that the reason for the
bad blood between REYNOLDS and WEAN was that WEAN had
committed the armed robbery in 1961 which REYNOLDS was
arrested for in Jersey City, New Jersey. CLARK stated that
it had been planned that REYNOLDS, WEAN, and CLARK would
"pull this job", but due to a mix-up REYNOLDS and CLARK
left the bar and WEAN, having the only gun, held up. and
robbed the owners of the bar. CLARK advised that they -
(REYNOLDS and CLARK) were met later. by WEAN, and to the best
of his knowledge they all received approximately $1000 each.
CLARK went on to state that REYNOLDS was angry because he
had to go through the trial, and it cost him money to pay
off some people which WEAN never reimbursed REYNOLDS for.
CLARK stated that as a result of this REYNOLDS wants
nothing to do with WEAN, and WEANstays away from REYNOLDS.

It will be noted in the report of LINCOLN J. STOKES
on June 26, 1963, at Newark, this arrest and trial was.
discussed on pages 42, 43, and 44,

cognizant of the actual reason for their presence, and
although they confiscated the chemicals-apparently never
tied the facts together and did not know that this dis-
. ruption of the business,was the real reason for their being
there, CLARK went on to advise that "HAPPY" REYNOLDS was
present but was hiding in the automobile parked near the i
factory and the police never discovered him. This

and they were to be paid $1500 upon completion of the job.
CLARK went on to advise that as a result of their arrest
prior to the fulfillment of the contract, NUNZIO never
paid the money. CLARK went on to advise that he is ex-
tremely bitter about NUNZIO's not paying the money or

, paying the police so that the charges could have been

dropped. .

CLARK went on at this point to advise that in
New Jersey money will buy just about anyone from judges on
down in the local towns and cities.

two occasions fulfilled "contracts" for” TONY PROVENZANO

ceived $2,500 directly from TONY PROVENZANO at a Local 560
meeting. CLARK advised’ that when PHILLIPS was assaulted on
