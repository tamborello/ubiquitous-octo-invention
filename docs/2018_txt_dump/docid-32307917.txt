According to BU T-14, COTRONI is a member of
the "Bonanno Group," and there is speculation that this
potential meeting could be to "bury the hatchet" by the
"Bonanno and Magaddino Groups. "

 

LA COSA NOSTRA
INTERNAL DISSENSION

 

In December of 1966, information was: received
from BU T-15 to the effect that PETER JOSEPH MAGADDINO
had visited with JOSEPH BONANNO apparently to act as an
intermidiary between BONANNO and STEVE MAGADDINO, It was .
conjectured that BONANNO was attempting to regain control
of his former "Family" of LCN and have if sanctioned by
the Commission through STEVE MAGADDINO.

On October 20, 1966, BU T-16 advised that SAM

PIERI continues to gain papularity with "the organization."
Informant stated that PIERI is more congenial and better
able to solve the differences of the group then FRED.

‘ RANDACCIO. It was the informant's opinion that if any-

: thing happened to STEVE MAGADDINO in the near future,

PIERI would stand a good chance of being elevated in the

‘Organization through some of the members.

On August 25, 1967, BU T-4 advised that leader-
-ship in the LCN is still vested in STEVE MAGADDINO and
that FRED RANDACCIO is next in line to assume command in
the "Magaddino Family" as soon as his current legal dif-
ficulties are resolved.

i ' On May 8, 1967, Buffalo City Police conducted

a raid on a meeting being held at Panaro's Lounge, Buffalo,
and arrested 37 individuals, including 17 LCN members, on
charges of Consorting with Known Criminals.

Among those arrested was FRED G, RANDACCIO,

Investigation has developed that the COTRONI
Brothers have controlled or played a major role in direct-
ing all major criminal activities in the Montreal area,
Previous reports have identified the members of the
COTRONI organization,

 

In March of 1966, PETER A. MAGADDINO and DOMINIC
ROMEO were reportedly in touch with VINCENT COTRONI and
PAUL VIOLI in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

 

On November 28, 1966, the Montreal Police Depart-
ment, Montreal, Quebec, @anada. arrested WILLIAM BONANNO,
also known as Salvatore Vincent Bonanno, the son of JOE
BONANNO, PATRICK and VITO DE FILIPPO, LOUIS GRECO, PETER
NOTARO, CARL SIMARI and PETER JOSEPH’ MAGADDINO, a cousin '
of STEVE MAGADDINO who had been missing fron his residence

- on Grand Island, New York, for several years. These indi-
viduals refused to furnish any information as to the purpose
of their being. in Canada. They were all subsequently
deported from Canada, ; ‘

 

: On January 15, 1967, BU T-14 advised that VINCENT

2 COTRONI of Montreal, Quebec, had in recent days been en-

. gaged in a number of meetings at Montreal. The informant

was of the opinion that this indicated some type of a meeting
in the United States in the near future, which meeting would
probably be attended by COTRONI, who had left Montreal for
an unknown destination.

 

According to informant, there is some “indication

that COTRONI had been in difficulty with the "Magaddino
Family" in Buffalo, New York, and there have been efforts
on the part of COTRONI to negotiate some sort of settlement
relative to these difficulties. It was suggested at one
time that COTRONI, himself, might travel to the United
States but when he apparently refused to do so, PAUL VIOLI
was suggested as a possible intermidiary. VIOLI, however, -
according to BU T-14, refused to travel to the United

a States when assurances as to his safety were apparently

: not Forthcoming.
