Fort Worth, Texas gamblers and from other sources around
Fort Worth that WILSON had received money from Las Vegas
gamblers, the names of which were not mentioned prior to
WILSON's allegation. Informant stated that there was no way
for him to prove this but that the information that he
received was the common talk among the gambling circle in
Fort Worth. .

There is no indication in the files of the Dallas
Division that the above information has been received from
other sources and there is no data available which will
confirm or disprove this allegation. For the information of
the Las Vegas Office, information was developed at Fort Worth
from DL-149-C who stated that he had heard that WILSON, Attorney
General, State of Texas, had taken money from Las Vegas,
Nev. gamblers at the time of his election to keep Texas
closed up as far as gambling was concerned, thus forcing the
Texas people to travel by air and other means to Las Vegas
to do their gambling.

Colo. purchasing milk companies all over the United States,
DL-149-C stated that he had received this information from \

DL 94=-55A

of Fort Worth, Texas, and who was formerly from Kansas City,
Mo. Informant stated that WOODWARD married a distant relative
of EUGENE SMALDONE of Denver, Colo, and WOODWARD's wife's
relatives are still in Denver. Informant stated that he
understood from WOODWARD that his wife's people were "big"

in the Italian circle in Denver, Colo. and that she has an
uncle in Danver, Colo. Informant stated that the reason he
believes that WOODWARD knows people in Denver was because at
one time informant was having trouble in operation of his
gambling establishment at Ft. Worth, because a Ft. Worth
hoodlum, MARTIN BUSTER LOICANO, was trying to force informant
into paying 25% of the take of his gambling establishment.
Informant stated that he knew that WOODWARD knew some Italian
people in Denver and asked WOODWARD to find out if LOICANO
was connected with the mafia from these people in Denver.
Informant stated that WOODWARD who is not Italian, after
having a few drinks, make a telephone call to someone in
Denver and asked them if LOICANO was a member of the mafia,
and according to informant, whoever was at the oher end of
the line “ate WOODWARD out". WOODWARD then told informant
that he could not ever go back up to Denver, Informant
stated that he would attempt to develop further information
concerning this, however, if anyone questioned WOODWARD at
this time, it would "heat up" informant.
