Passaic, Bergen, and Hudson Telephone Directories on
March 16, 1961 in an effort to locate the address of the
Redbird frucking with negative results,

SA LINKER made a pretext call to telephone

number TU 7-0220 and received no answer, FINKLE then

produced a copy of an unsigned letter from Lehman Brothers

(investment advisory service) at William Street, New York City,

directed to Mir. MARVIN ZALK, Administrator, 591 Summit Avenue,
_ Jersey City, New Jersey, and was dated December 18, 1957,

the Passaic and Bergen County Welfare Fund Pension Account
would be $2,000.00 for the period of December 1, 1957 to
November 30, 1958, payable quarterly in advance,

The enclosed Lehman portfolio dated November 2,
1957 reflects purchases of 56 common and preferred stocks and
‘bonds amounting to $583,201.50 with a book value of $615,740.09.

_ The above figures reflect the stock purchases made
by Lehman in behalf of the Passaic and Bergen County Welfare

County Welfare Fund Pension Accounts, audited reports, all
of which were prepared by BERNARD TORRACO, Certified Public
‘Accountant, 257 Central Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey.

FINKLE advised that TORRACO handles all of Local

The minutes reflected the Administrator advised
the trustees thet a check in the sum of $400,000.00 was
turned over to the U. S. Glass and Chemical Corporation as

company to the fund.

On March 24, 1961, PCI FINKLE was recontacted and
made available three eighteen inch by twelve inch grey
colored booklets entitled, "Trucking Employees of Passaic
and Bergen County Welfare Fund" for the year ended November 30,

Welfare Fund and the Pension Account at its most recent
examination by TORRACO, Local 560 Accountant, During the
course of the review of the Consolidated Audit, it was noted
that under the column Assets, the Welfare Fund contains .
$497,633.53, The Pension Account contains a balance of

"Pursuant to the instruction to the Board of
Trustees, court proceedings have been started against
OfTILLO and Sons, Russo Trucking, Smith and Jordan, and
South Orange Express,"

"The union does not have any signed contracts with
PETER PETRIZZO or Redbird Trucking so no legal action could
be taken against these two companies,

"An informal arrangement. was worked out with Redbird
Trucking, whereby Redbird would pay its current contribution
-and $250,00 per week toward its old unpaid balance of
approximately $20,000,00,

"To date the Welfare Fund has not received any
payment from Redbird Trucking, either on their current
contributions or their old unpaid balance,

"I would suggest that a signed contract be obtained
from Redbird and suit instituted,"

MARAN's preface continues to discuss several
‘other trucking concerns and the fact that they were all put
on notice that unless they paid their account a suit would
be instituted,

FINKLE then made available a document dated
March 6, 1961 directed to the trustees of the trucking employees
of the Passaic and Bergen County Welfare Fund which lists 32
companies delinquent in their payments to the Welfare Fund,

One of the firms noted was Redbird Trucking
(no address), telephone TU 7-0020, which according to MARAN,
last paid into the fund on September 3, 1960, The document
points out that Redbird hires a tctal of 47 men on Local 560's
union rolis. ;

. It is to be noted that in MARAN's preface to his
investigative report dated March 6, 1961 he indicated that
Redbird was in arrears in the amount of $20,000,00 and that
"informal' arrangements had been made whereby Redbird agreed

to paysits current contribution plus $250.00 towards its unpaid
balance,

contradiction to the procedures outlined in the Dental
Program Booklet.

E,. Regarding the eye care phase of the Welfare
Fund Program, FINKLE stated that all members of Local 560
and their families are entitled to eye examination and
glasses whenever prescribed, i

; FINKLE presented the question, Why is there only

one optician, PHILLEP;APFEL and Company, 210 Fulton
—Syreee fou ork fe » qualified-to-examination and make

glasses for memb B[ot the Local? He stated that here

again when signing Checks payable to APFEL he has noticed

that APFEL has an extremely lucrative business through his

affiliations with the local and has always been curious to

know whether APFEL kickbacks a percentage of the fees

charged to representatives of the union, responsible for securing

his services.

At that point, FINKLE produced a 14 page typewritten
report entitled, "Investigation and Report of Delinquent _ (,
Accounts for the Welfare Fund of Local 560, for the period of |; ;
February 6, through March 8, 1961 prepared by SOSEPHUIARAN :
JR." oe oe os remfsces

FINELE pointed out. that MARAN is a $150,00 a week
employee working under MARVIN ZALK and is responsible for
the collection of delinquent Welfare Fund accounts, of which
there are always many.

SA LINKER reviewed MARAN's investigation report
and observed he had subheadings for each delinquent account
which included the name of the firm, the address, and the
date the account last contributed to the fund. That was
followed by a narrative stating further the date he inter-
viewed the official of the delinquent firm in an effort to
collect the funds and wherever his contact did not
result in either obtaining a check in the amount due or
he had not secured assurances from the officials to whom
he was addressing, that money was forthcoming, MARAN threatened
the individual with suit against the firm,

- Iwo exceptions to the threat of suit were noted
during the review, the first was in his comments concerning

FINKLE stated that the irony of the. rate increase
is that as a member of the Trustee Board he continues to
refuse to pay the two cents rise in the rate and has not
been bombarded by strike threats by the union.

/ He stated that he did not know whether MARCHINI
or SCALETTI are paying the increasedrate, but doubts that
they are.

B. As a trustee of the Welfare Fund he signs ;
almost all of the Union Welfare checks payable to the physicians,
‘dentist, and the union optician.

; FINKLE stated that he has signed checks for
as much as $12,000.00 payable to a dentist on the rolis of
the Welfare Fund for one month's services to 560 members
and their families, He stated that he possesses no conclusive
proof, but feels that theezoriitant fees charges by the
dentist must require them to kickback some per cent of the
fees to the officials responsible for their selection as a
participating dentist.

FINKLE stated that he was nut attempting to be
facetious when he stated that any dentist making $12,000.00
a month would be the richest man in the profession over a
period of. one year,

C. He explained that under the present system
voted by and adopted by the local, the 33 cents an hour
Welfare Fund rate is broken down as follows:

‘Eleven cents goes to the Pension Fund, approximately
six cents to. dental expenses, one cent for eye care, and the
remainder is allocated to the medical and hospital insurance
handled by the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company.

FINKLE stated that he has from time to time
attempted to query MARVIN ZALK, Administrator of the Welfare
Fund, to learn the methods by which contributions from
‘employers ave handled and reflected; whether bills from
dentists are checked for accuracy before checks are drawn for
payment and the general. bookkeeping procedures for the funds.

FINKLE stated that on every occasion ZALK has

‘D

Docld:32309677 Page 5

NK 92-937
NRL :mrmd

politely refused to satisfy him and passed. off his questions
concerning the fund's bookkeeping operations with a statement
to the effect that every administrative procedure is handled
by his secretarial force to his (ZALK's) satisfaction and
that FINKLE need not concern himself with that phase of the
fund's operations.

D. *FINKLE stated that in an effort to prove to
SA LINKER that something is radically wrong with the operations
of the fund, he produced a three inch by six inch booklet
entitled, "Trucking Employees Welfare Fund Dental Program".
He offered the booklet to SA LINKER for his perusal and
pointed out that page seven of the booklet reads as follows:
"with this authorization card (referring to the members of
the Program). you will receive a list of names, addresses and
telephone numbers of the participating dentists and the
dental. plan office",

"Call the participating dentist you select for an
appointment, You will get.a prompt appointment and we
assure you that you will be treated with the utmost courtesy".

Upon completing the review of the booklet, FINKLE
pointed out that to his knowledge no member of Local 560
has ever been furnished a list of participating dentists.
He stated that in order to prove his point he would call
Doctor LEO MARCUS, the Administrator of the Dental Progran,
at the Local's 591 Summit Avenue office and FINKLE stated
that he would pretext the call by indicating to MARCUS that
many of his employees have requested that a list of the
fund's participating dentists and their addresses he: posted
at the terminal in order to save time, in selecting dentists
of their choice,

FINKLE called MARCUS' office, telephone number
OL 3-4330, in the presence of SA LINKER and asked for Doctor
MARCUS. When informed that MARCUS was out, FINKLE identified
himself to MARCUS' secretary and proceeded to explain the
pretext. Upon completion of the call FINKLE stated that
she informed him that a list of the participating dentists
was not available to the men and that they were required to
first appear in Doctor MARCUS' office for examination and that
they were then assigned to a dentist by Doctor MARCUS,

He pointed out that this policy was a clear

On March 15, 1961, PCI CLIFFORD FINKLE, SR.,

owner of the Passaic Terminal and Transportation Company,
Inc., Bloomfield Avenue, Allwood, New Jersey (a large local
Cartage Agent) advised SA NORBERT R. LINKER, that he is one
of three representatives of management on the six man
Board of Trustees of the Passaic and Bergen County Branch
of Local 560's Welfare Fund. He stated that in this capacity
as a Trustee he meets with all of the union officials and
‘fellow board members as often as twice a month at the ;
union's Welfare Fund Office, 591 Summit Avenue, Jersey City,
New Jersey. He related that the board is presently composed
of ZIGMUND PSKOWSKI, also known as "ZIGGIE"; JOSEPH SANTIELLO,

; ‘also known as "STIXIE", and EDWARD HUGHES, all of whom

ant represent Local 560; ALBERT SCALETTI, owner of a trucking

i concern in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey; AL CHINI,

owner of Moon Carriers, Clifton, New Jersey, and himself.

 

  
  

\ - He advised that JACOB FRIEDLAND, attorney for the
local, attends the board meetings and presides over disputes
arising over welfare rates, medical eligibility problems
and many Operational procedures,

FINELE stated that although unable to prove his |
suspicions at this time he believes that the funds assigned
to the Welfare Fund are being misappropriated by the -
recipient of the monies before they, are disbursed to insurance
companies, dentists, etc., or they are returned to the union
officials in the form of a kickback.

\ 4 4) Be. £fered the following reasons for his suspicions:
a C bse PR APS Ty
ay i A, J-SCALETTI and MARCHINI readily agreed to accept
‘the 33"cents, employee contribution rate, demanded by

   
 
 

PROVENZANO and PSKOWSKI even though it meant that a two cents

loss would eventually be incurred by every owner operator
within the sphere of the local,

FINKLE explained that practically all trucking
‘company employees must now contribute 33 cents per hour,
eight hours u day, five days a week, to the Welfare Fund
for every member of Local 560, which the firm employs, He .
stated that a large firm such as: his must therefore contribute
as much as $25,000.00 a year, or more into a fund which they
. Cannot audit to determine how the funds are spent. ;
