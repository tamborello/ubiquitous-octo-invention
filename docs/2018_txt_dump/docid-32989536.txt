SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE —

   
 

Telephone Rm. —
Director Sec*’y —_.

At 11:15.a.m. on November 12, 1975, Cartha DeLoach
former Assistant to the Director, telephonically advised me that he
was interviewed under oath by Mike Epstein and David Boshong of the
Senate Select Committee on November 11, 1975. He advised that he
was representéd by Charles MeNellis, an attorney in the Washington law

firm of Edward Morgan: The testimony was recorded by a stenographer.

and principally dealt with general guidelines Mr. DeLoach used in briefing
various Attorneys General concerning FBI work. They also inquired . 7
concerning the Counterintelligence Program in that they asked him if he

Shad ever briefed Ramsey Clark regarding the Counterintelligence Program. 1
Mr. DeLoach described that portion of the interview as a "political tug of.

war" in which Epstein attempted to have him say that Ramsey Clark had &
not been briefed, and Boshong attempted to. have him say that Rims mNY
Clark had been briefed. . \9

_ Mr. DeLoach said that he testified that he had briefed Ramsey ™
Clark regarding the Counterintelligence Program and ‘also briefed’ ‘Clark t
regarding wiretaps and microphones at Clark's specific request: Mr. DeLoachy
was asked whether he had written a memorandum regarding that briefing, Xe
but he could not recall specifically whether the memorandum was prepared.
He did say that it was the practice for a memorandum to be prepared recounting
conversations with Department officials. The Committee representatives
then advised Mrs DeLoach that they had asked for such documentation from
the Bureau, but a memorandum indicating DeLoach had briefed Ramsey Clark
regarding the Counterintelligence Program was not received among the
documents furnished by the Bureau. Mr. DeLoach requested me to advise
the Bureau that iDilew if such a, memorandum can be oe it should be

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

 

Mr. DeLoach was asked whether anyone from the Bureau had
alerted him to the possibility that he would be asked concerning briefing
Ramsey Clark and whether anyone had suggested to him what his response
should be. He denied that such was the case, but did say that he had
received a telephone call from Assistant Director Wannall asking him
the question whether DeLoach had briefed any Attorneys General regarding
the Counterintelligence Program.

Mr. DeLoach was requested by the Committee to return on
Tuesday, November 18, 1975, at 2:30 p.m. for additional interview at which
time the subject will be the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and
Martin Luther King.

Mr. DeLoach said that a Mr. Wallach of the Committee’s
staff described a memorandum which he claimed that DeLoach had prepared
regarding Jack Anderson and the Warren Commission. Mr. DeLoach said
that he could not recall such amemorandum.

Mr. DeLoach requested that the Bureau make available a
Bureau representative for consultation at 2:30 p.m. on November 18, 1975.
Mr. DeLoach said he madethis request because he was uncertain as to the
scope of the testimony he might be asked to give regarding Martin Luther
King. In response to his question, I told Mr. DeLoach that informatim
concerning certain confidential sources involved in the origination ofthe
investigation of Martin Luther King has not been discussed with the
Committee staff, but limited discussion has been had with Chairman Frank
Church. I told Mr. DeLoach that inquiries concerning the informants involved
in the basic information in that case should not be answered due to the
sensitivity of the information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. That the Intelligence Division determine whether there is

a memorandum describing a briefing of Ramsey Clark by Mr. DeLoach
concerning the Counterintelligence Program.
