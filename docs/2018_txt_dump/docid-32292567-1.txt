ADMINISTRATIVE

CG 7016-PC is a leader of organized crime, whose
identity is known to the Bureau. On March 9, 1967, contact
was made with him by SA WILLIAM F. ROEMER, JR. It is the
normal procedure of this source to evade direct questions
put to him, but to be generally responsive when conversation
is directed into general matters of investigative interest
in areas where it is known the source is knowledgeable.
However, inasmuch as his answers in response to this tech-
nique are not specifically responsive to any question asked,
the information which he provides is therefore subject to
interpretation and conclusions by the contacting Agent.
Therefore, the information provided by this informant in
this instance is placed on the administrative pages, rather
than in the body of this report.

On March 9, 1967, through conversation of CG 7016-PC,
it was determined that GUS ALEX, LESLIE KRUSE and RALPH PIERCE,
with HY GODFREY assisting were at that time interested in
defeating the bill generally referred to as the "Stop and
Frisk Bill" which was at that time pending in the Illinois
State General Assembly. It is noted that this bill would
authorize local police in Illinois to stop any person they
reasonably believe may have just committed a crime or was
about to commit one and obtain from that person his identity —-
and an explanation for his conduct. The bill would also.
provide permission to allow a search for a weapon, From
the conversation of the source at that time, it appeared
that ALEX, PIERCE and KRUSE, who formerly worked under the
direction of MURRAY L. HUMPHREYS, were now engaged on behalf
of organized crime in the function of establishing and main-
taining contacts with public officials, members of the judiciary,
law enforcement officers and members of organized labor so
that whenever favorable treatment is desired from any members
