nancial Payment to AMCORE
ACT HOM REQUIRED - REFLRENCES:

ACTION: FIT
REF: BIR 9630 (dated 9 Jan 63)

1. AMCORE/2 is presently paid at the rate of $2,500.00 monthly,
which covers all costs of preparing the 30-minute daily program carried
over (iden). Under this pres:nt system, (iden) monthly billings reach
KUBARK through a secure mechanism acd payments to (iden) are’ made
regularly through this organization which aleo provides cover for
A/2's operaticns.

2. Hormally, monthly paymenta inciwe air time, telephone lines
evete, the programming costs paid to A/2, and miscellaneous items
which vary from month to month. Under this aystem operating ecets of
the entire effort are paid monthly by une check. Headquarters is
satiefied with the arrangement which works well with respect to cover
and security.

 

de Statenents by 4/2 that payments to him have been late vere
eonfirmed by the president of (iden) whe explained, however, that
fisecl road blocks which had delayed such payments during 1962: have now “
boen remved. He assured us that 4/2 will now receive the same prompt
payments afforded mesbera of his staff.

& 4/2 ie aware that KUBARK has complete control over the level cf
his compensation and can exercise editcrial contrcl] over hie POETS.
Be undoubtedly remembers that during last year his payments wore
Gsoressed frm $3,000.00 to $2,500.00, on the recommendation of JMMAVE. _

 

§ There ia no quistion of the ability of A/2 to attract and hold |

an eudience. Listener response to his programs has been greater than
thet of any other single progrom. In view of hie present end potential |
wsefulness, it ie recummanded that ocntrols on A/2 be limited to
suporviaion of his radio program and that no effort be made tu restrain -
hie political or pursonal activities micss they tend to discredit him
@6 & radio personality and hense destroy hie uscfulnese t. KUBARK.. eo
