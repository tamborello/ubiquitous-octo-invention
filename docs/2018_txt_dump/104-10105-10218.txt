11. In December 1965 WER BELL contacted a Miami DCD
asset and told him that he and six Cuban exiles in the U. S.
had organized a group, including approximately 20 Cubans
inside Cuba, to perform a commando operation in Cuba during
early January 1966., Their primary mission was the assassination
of Fidel Castro, with the secondary mission of blowing up the
generators that supply electricity to Havana, Cuba. WER BELL,
at the time, stated that he was trying to get a "green light"
from CIA to proceed with the mission, and inferred that the
mission would be called off if such approval was not obtained.

12. On 7 February 1966 the Miami office of the FBI
reported that WER BELL had been in contact with various news
agencies concerning an alleged plan to assassinate Fidel Castro,
and reportedly also had discussed the plan with Mr. Richard
Phillips, Public Affairs Officer, Department of State, Washington,
D.C. WER BELL claimed to have a group of some 500 men infiltrated
into Cuba and said that they were ready for action to overthrow
the regime immediately following the assassination of Castro.
According to the FBI, WER BELL gave the impression that he is
acquainted with many high government officials, both in the U. S.
and other countries, and implied that his assassination plan
had been approved by CIA.

13. According to a memorandum in WER BELL's file, on 7
February 1968, one Bruce Arman Baker telephoned an employee
of this Agency and said he had been in contact with WER BELL.
Mr. Baker said that WER BELL was in the weapons manufacturing
business and delivered them by air throughout the world.
Mr. Baker said that he understood that WER BELL does this for
CIA. Mr. Baker said that he understood from WER BELL that he
would have to get a CIA security clearance to fly for WER BELL.
Baker said that he was afraid that his past smuggling record
might keep him from getting a CIA clearance. 35

14. WER BELL came to the attention of the| |
in early 1969 when he went to Thailand representing himsé
as Vice President of Sionics, Atlanta, Georgia. He described
himself as a counterinsurgency expert, had a variety of weapons
to display, claimed to be a retired colonel, and introduced
himself at a local nightclub as Chief of CIA in Thailand.
WER BELL attempted to sell arms to the Thais and also to a
variety of U. S. military elements’? passed
the gist of his reputation to key personalities in eU. S.
mission and the Thai Government stressing that he was not
sponsored in any way by the U. S. Government.

"the new land project" sought to establish a tax shelter on
one of the out-islands of the Caribbean by forcefully taking

is supposedly involved in the paramilitary training of forces
who would participate in this adventure. According’ to Dyckman,
the paramilitary training supposedly was to take place in
Georgia, where WER BELL is based.

9. On 22 July 1974, the FBI reported that WER BELL may
be in possession of a one-line note from former CIA Director:
William Colby stemming from a chance meeting with the Director
at an OSS alumni dinner, reading something like "Good to. see
you again.'"' This note was apparently used by WER BELL to
suggest that he and Mr. Colby were good friends. This infor-
mation was passed on to Mr. Colby on 9 August 1974.

10. According to reporting from several Stations, WER BELL
and Arthur L. Smith (a cohort of WER BELL's) were in several
Central American countries during August and early September
1962. Their principal activity appeared to be contacting
officials of the governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and
El Salvador for the purpose of obtaining recognition of a
de facto Cuban Government in exile called the "United
Organization for the Liberation of Cuba." In discussions with
Nicaraguan Government representatives, WER BELL claimed the
proposed Cuban Government in exile had the support of 90
separate Cuban exile organizations and 186,000 Cuban exiles.
WER BELL offered a representative of the Nicaraguan Government
$100,000 to obtain that government's recognition of the Cuban
Government in exile. The group claimed to have its headquarters
at 1025 Connecticut Avenue, NW, in Washington, D.C. While in
Guatemala, Smith claimed that the group had a man in the .
Department of State in Washington, D.C., whom they pay $6,000
per year "to keep them advised."

6. Mr. Muldoon contacted Agency employee| ___*P
ee on 22 May 1974. Mr. Muldoon told Mr. McTighe
tha €' was nominal Vice President of a Washington-based
firm called "Security Consultants International." He presented
Mr. McTighe with a report containing the essential data he
possessed concerning WER BELL and other members of FOA whom
he had met on 17 and 20 May 1974 in Washington, D.C. According
to Mr. Muldoon, WER BELL had hopes of establishing gaming
casinos, hotel and other tourist facilities in Abaco catering
to the U. S. tourist crowd. As a consequence of some run-in
with Prime Minister Pindling of the Bahamas, however, WER BELL
is apparently persona non grata in the Bahamas; hence his
ambitions appeared to be contingent on Abacan independence.
Mr. Muldoon reported that at least on two occasions WER BELL
made a concerted effort to involve persons formerly affiliated
with the Agency in the activities of the FOA in support of
its independence. On several occasions, WER BELL introduced

Mr. Muldoon and Mr. as active Agency officials, implying
that either the Agenty or the United States Government supported
the ai the FOA. WER BELL also proposed to Messrs. Muldoon

and in separate conversations that they conduct a study,

i
involving a’Visit to Abaco, to determine the feasibility of
Abaco's independence in political and economic terms. The
study was to include interviews with citizens of Abaco prior
to an alleged "plebiscite" on independence to take place in
Abaco on 28 June 1974.93 In default of the collaboration of
either Muldoon or WER BELL hired Mr. Walter Joseph
Mackem, a former Agéficy riend of both Muldoon and
According to WER BELL's file, Mackem later in 1974 contacted
the Agency in an attempt to get an official policy on the
activities of the FOA. Mackem was informed that the case
comes under FBI jurisdiction, that this Agency has no official
involvement, and that all information we had on the matter had
been made available to the FBI. He was advised at that time
to report his contacts and any information he had to the FBI.
