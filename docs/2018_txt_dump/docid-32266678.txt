access. If the House Floor says that the members should not

have access, then of course it would be the resolution of the |

Floor that would deny the member access and not our own rules

 

Wrasically, what it would do is that it would cause the
House of Representatives to take a second look at the scope
and impact of Kale 11, not as an abstract question of
| principle, but as a concrete instance where if what the ember
| wanted access to was something that could be fairly described

as the "family jewels," then it would be the burden of the

 

|| full committee to say that it .is too risky to turn over this |

| material to this member.

{ It would then provide a mechanism for transferring that

would then’ “be: in a posture of debating the issue in the

i ve

| concrete context, that is, the specific reguest of a specific

|| member to see a specific document, and you could bring to the
I ttention of the House the nature of “that document without
actually revealing it.

If, of course, the House votes to reaffirm Rule 11 in
this instance, access would be granted. It is my judgment

that the Agency would buy this rule as giving them the maximu

iprotection of the disclosure, or the routine and automatic

Mr. Blakey. We discussed that with them and the kind of |

I-cannot suggest to this committee that you adopt a rule

‘up with the following suggestion that may meet the needs of |

Mes. Berning. There are nine-ayes, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman Stokes. Nine members having voted in the
affirmative, this meeting is now declared in executive session
and all members of the public are asked to excuse themselves
from the room.

Mr. Blakey. Let me see if I can present the problem to
you as succinctly as I can, although perhaps I should. begin
with an apology to the committee for bringing about a meeting
of the full committee on such short notice.

Obviously, there has been a recess and some of the
membership has been gone for the last week and this is really!
the first opportunity that we have had.

The problem has come up during the recess in our efforts

: |
to work with the Central Intelligence Agency in preparing

hearings. The problem really goes as follows: In the centra}
~ i

case study is the Mexico City issue. The Agency has given us

 

complete access to everything in this area and this includes |
the nature of the surveillance that the Agency had of the
Russian and Cuban Embassies.

They had photographic and electronic surveillance of bot

3] less, and that is a big question, more or less. And I now
4 | have to say that the person alleged to have been Oswald went

in the embassy.

3 |

5 7 Nevertheless, the Agency never came up with a photograph |
; of Oswald coming in and out of the Agency. Indeed they sent
"| back up to Washington the wrong photograph. This has given
a rise to the whole problem of the mysterious plan.

| The significance of the issue of the investigation

10

| Literally speaks for itself. If Oswald did not go in and |
i apply for that visa, and someone else did, then it is obvious

12 | that Oswald had an associate. If he had an associate, the.
