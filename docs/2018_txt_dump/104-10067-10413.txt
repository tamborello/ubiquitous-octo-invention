sibility, in any case. Even with a photograph, it
would have required very special efforts, triggered
by other interested United States agencies, to have
made a positive identification in view of OSWALD's
hotel registration under alias.

There the matter rested until the murder of President

Kennedy on 22 November 1963.

On 22 November 1963, after learning of the arrest 6f
Lee Harvey OSWALD in connection with the assassination of
Kennedy, the Mexico City Station cabled Headquarters at
22292 (1729 Washington time) and referenced its earlier
messages of 8-9 and 15 October.

(1) According to VOA broadcast heard at the

Station regarding President Kennedy's assassination,

one Lee H. OSWALD, age 24, has been arrested in

Dallas possibly in connection with President Kennedy.

(2) Direct headquarters attention to references. *
(3) Request by priority pouch a photograph of

OSWALD so that the Station can check all recent

LIEMPTY coverage for indentification. Forwarding soonest

copies of only visitor to Soviet Embassy 28 October

{sic - 1 (se - 2) October] who could be identical with

OSWALD.

In addition to alerting Headquarters to the Station's
traffic on Lee OSWALD, the Station initiated a review of all
LLANSELIBLS /OF
voice intercept as well as photographic coverage of the Soviet

. Anxd/CuBbdAd diplomatic installations. This review of voice in-
tercept transcripts conducted by the monitor and other Station
personnel turned up other transcripts of conversations inter-
cepted on 27 and 28 September and on 1 October 1963. These
conversations were reported to Headquarters on 23 November

1963. [MEXI-7023 (IN 67108), MEXI-7025 (IN 67188), and

MEXI-7033 (IN 67232).]
It became evident from this review that OSWALD had also

visited the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City and had talked

’ there with a clerk, a Mexican national, identified as Silvia
DURAN. After the assassination and the publicity about Lee
OSWALD, Silvia DURAN told a number of relatives and friends
that she had talked to OSWALD who had applied for a transit
visa to Cuba. Silvia DURAN and her husband, Horacio DURAN-
Navarro, were detained and questioned by the Mexican police

from 23 to 25 November 1963. [Comment: According to the
files, the Station suggested to Mexican authorities that they

arrest Silvia DURAN, since she had spoken with OSWALD, to
ascertain what information/could provide on OSWALD's reasons
for going to Mexico City. (See MEXI-7034 IN 67236), 24
November 1963.)]

After giving some of the details of her own personal
background - she was an admitted leftist sympathizer and had
formerly worked for the Mexican-Cuban Institute for Cultural
Relations - Silvia DURAN said that whan she first heard of
the death of President Kennedy she had been depressed and -
thought the assassin must have been a maniac. When she
learned he was associated with the "Fair Play for Cuba Commit-
tee" she did not believe it.

When she learned the name of the assassin was Lee OSWALD
she remembered he was the man who had come to the Consulate
about two months before to get a visa to pass through Cuba on
his way to the Soviet Union. She realized he had said he was
married to a Russian and that he had belonged to the "Fair Play
for Cuba" dyipisz¢é¢ group. She checked her file on him in the
Consular archives and from the description of OSWALD, she was
sure it was the same man. OSWALD was denied a Cuban transit
visa because he did not yet have a Soviet visa, and he was told
to get the Soviet visa first, but it was noted that this would
require about four months. She had asked the Cuban Consul,
Eusedio AZCUEn to talk to OSWALD and they had an argument.
WREf The Consul had phoned the Soviet Consulate and talked to

the person handling OSWALD's Soviet visa request, who had said

1. The following information waasreceived
from a usually reliable and extremely sensitive
source: On 1 October 1963, an American male con-
tacted the Soviet Embassy and identified himself
as Lee OSWALD. This office determined that OSWALD
had been at the Soviet Embassy on 28 September 1963
and had talked with Valeriy Viadimirovich KOSTIKOV,

a member of the Consular Settion, in order to learn

' if the Soviet Embassy had received a reply from

“Washington concerning his request. We have no clari-

fying information with regard to this request.

2. Our Headquarters has informed us that the
OSWALD above is probably identical with Lee Henry
[sic - Harvey] OSWALD, born on 18 October 1939 in
New Orleans, Louisiana, a former radar operator in the
U. S. Marine Corps who defected to the Sovéet Union in
October 1959.

3. This office will advise you if additional
information on this matter is received.

The Station forwarded the original of the above memoran-
dum to the Ambassador, the Minister, the Counselor for Political
Affairs, and the Regional Security Officer. Carbon copies were
forwarded to the Legal Attache, Naval Attache, and. the I&NS
representative.

Within its limitations and capabilities, Mexico City
Station had done all it could to comply with Headquarters
instructions: .

a. ‘Headquarters had been alerted, and in turn
those agencies with an ivestigative or policy interest
in OSWALD. as an American in the United States had been
alergted, both in Washington and in the field.

b. Mexico City Station had no further contacts
by OSWALD to report because - as it was ultimately
ascertained - he had rok Mexico City at 0830 on 2
October 1963. .

c. OSWALD was not an Agency investigative respon-

(5) Reference and possible identification

on any further contacts or positive identification
of OSWALD.
[DIR-74830, 10 October 1963]
Headquarters feedback to Mexico City of OSWALD's cor-

rect description should have been sufficient, in view of

the i

neongruities with the details deduced from the photo-

graph of the unidentified male, to keep these two matters

apart as investigative facts. But things did not work out

that

way.

On 15 October 1963, Mexico Station asked Headquarters

to "please pouch a photograph og OSWALD". [MEXI-6534 (IN
#

40357), 15 October 1963] Headquarters electrically sent to

the Department of the Navy the following message on 24

October 1963:.

1963.

Subject: Lee Henry [sic - Harvey] OSWALD.
Reference is made to GIA OUT Teletype No..
74673, dated 10 October 1963, regarding possible
presence of subject in Mexico City. It is re-
quested that you forward to this office as soon
as possible two copies of the most recent photo-
graph you have of subjeet. We will forward them
to our representative in Mexico, who will attempt
to determine if the Lee OSWALD in Mexico City and
subject are the same individual.
[DIR-77978, 24 October 1963]
No photograph had been received by CIA by 22 November

Having received permission from Headquarters to dissemi-

locally in the United States diplomatic mission infor-

mation regarding OSWALD's contact with the Soviet Embassy,

the Mexico City Station wrote a memorandum for the American

Ambassador.
14-00000

which dealt with a concurrent, but separate,

phenomenon, the description of an individual

observed going into and out of the Soviet

Embassy gate, had been locked on to Lee OSWALD

as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's

qualification, "appeared to be an Anerican",

"was transformed in the flatedesignation of the

unidentified individual as "The Ameeican".
There can be no question that this misredding of the
Mexico Station report was an analyst's error which escaped
deytection in the coordination before release: the descrip-
tive details attributed to OSWALD were so far off the mark
as to be immediately recognizable as.such by recipients in
Headquarters, among whom both the Navy and FBI had photo-
graphs of OSWALD. (In partial explanation, be it recalled
that as of that moment CIA had no photograph of OSWALD in.
Headquarters or in Mexico City to refer to.)

Cofifirmation of this judgment is provided by the

contents of the cable composed by the same analyst and

sent as of 22092 (two hours later) to Mexico Station,
referencing its 8 October cable:
(1) Lee OSWALD who called the Soviet Embassy on
jlOctober probably identical Lee Henry [sic]
OSWALD born on 18 October 1939, New Orleans, Loui-
siana, former radar operator in United States
Marines who defected to the USSR in October 1959.
OSWALD is five feet ten inches, one hundred and
sixty-five pounds, light brown wavy hair, blue
eyes.
(2) On 31 October 1959 he attempted to renounce
his United States citizenship to the United
States Embassy in Moscow, indicating he had ap-
‘plied for Soviet citizenship. On 13 February the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow received an undated letter

from OSWALD postmarked Minsk on 5 February 1961
14-00000

. -B-

in which subject indicated he desired return

of his U.S. passport as he wished to return

to the U.S.A. if “we could come to some agree-
ment concerning the dropping of any legal pro-
ceedings against me". On 8 July [1961] on his
own initiative he appeared at the Embassy with
his wife to see about his return to States.
Subject stated that he actually had never ap-
plied for Soviet citizenship and that his ap-
plication at that time had been to remain in
USSR and for a temporary extension of his tou-
rist visa pending outcome of his request. This
application, according to OSWALD, contained no
reference to Soviet citizenship. OSWALD stated
that he had been employed since 13 January 1960
in Belorussian radio and TV factory in Minsk
where he worked as a metal worker in research
shop. OSWALD was married on 30 April 1968 to
Marina Nikolaevna PUSAKOVA [sic], a dental tech-
nician born on 17 July 1941, USSR. No Head-
quarters traces. He attempted to arrange for
his wife to join him in Moscow so she could ap-
pear at Embassy for visa interview. His Ameri-
can passport was retuuned to him. U.S. Embassy
Moscow stated twenty months of realities of life
in Soviet Union had clearly had a maturing effect
on USWALD. .

(3) Latest Headquarters information was an FBI
report dated May 1962 saying the FBI had determined
OSWALD is still a U.S. citizen and both he and his
Soviet wife have exit permits and Department of
State had given approval for their travel with
their infant child to U.S.A.

(4) The Station should pass the information of
reference [its 8 October cable] and paragraph (1)
above to the Embassy, the FBI, the Navy, and I&NS

locally. The information given above as para-
14-00000

leaving Laredo at 0300 and arriving in Dallas at about 1420
the same day. (Warren: Commission Report, p. 736.]

Until 1 October 1963, the Mexico City Station knew
nothing of the presence in Mexico City of Lee Harvey OSWALD,
nor would the Station have been necessarily interested in
one of thousands of Americans visiting Mexico City. On 1
October 1963, a man, speaking broken Russian and identifying
himself as "Lee OSWALD", telephoned the Soviet Consulate.

"I was at your place last Saturday and spoke with the Consul
and they said that they'd sendda telegram to Washington so

I wanted to find out if you have anything new? But I don't
remember the name of the consul." As was the practice of
the Station, whenever it was possible to identify by name a
person telephoning the Soviet Embassy or Consulate, the
Station routinely reported the information to Headquarters.
The Station added the name of the Embassy guard with whom
OSWALD spoke and the name of the Soviet Consul OSWALD had
seen on 28 September 1963. It was also Station practice in
such a case to screen the product of its photographic sur-
veillance of the Soviet installation to ascertain whether
there might a photograph from which to obtain additional
identifying data. The Station found that on 1 October one of
the surveillance cameras recorded at 1216 the entry into the
Soviet compound of an individual wearing a white shirt and
khaki trousers. In the Sadtion's opinion, among all the per-
sons photographed that day, the above individual appeared to
be the only non-Latin and possibly American who entered the
compound. [Comment: A recent review of the logs of the
photographs taken reveals that the individual visited the
Soviet compound on 2 October from 1216 to 1222 rather than on
the first. OSWALD, as noted above, left Mexico City at 0830
on 2 October.] —

On the off-chance that there might be an association be-
tween the identification data dervied from technically ©
acquired information and the descriptive data derived from the
photograph, the Station reported that it had "photographs

* LEE HARVEY OSWALD IN MEXICO

On 26 September 1963, Lee Harvey OSWALD arrived in

Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, between 1330 and 1400.
From Nuevo Laredo, he traveled to Mexico City aboard bus
no. 516 6f the Flecha Roja Bus Line, which left Nuevo
Laredo at 1415. [Warren Commission Report, p. 733; Com-
mission Exhibit No. 2463, p. 10.] According to the records
of the Flecha Roja Bus Line, bus no. 516 arrived at the
Flecha Roja bus terminal, Heroes Ferrocarrileros 45, Mexico
City, at 1000 on 27 September 1963. [Warren Commission Re-
port, p. 733; Commission Exhibit No. 2121, p. 106.]° Within
an hour of his arrival in Mexico City, OSWALD registered at
the Hotel del Homercio, Calle Bernardino Sahagun 19, located
four blocks from the bus terminal. OSWALD remained in

Mexico City until early morning of 2 October 1963.

Apparently on both 30 September and 1 October 1963,
OSWALD went to the Agencia de Viajes, Transportes Chihuahuenses,
Paeseo de la Reforma 52, to arrange travel accommodations
from Mexico City to Dallas, Texas. [Commission Exhibits No.
1166, pp. 2-3, and No. 2535, pp. 5-7.] According to the re-
cords of the Agencia de Viajes, reservation and purchase
order No. 14618 was issued to Transportes del Norte bus line
in the name of Mr. H. 0. LEE for travel from Mexico City to
Laredo, Texas. .[At the bottom of this printed order the date
was indicated to be 30 September 1963 - Commission Exhibit No.
2535, pp. 5-7.] The records revealed further that a Greyhound
International Exchange Order No. 43599 for presentation to
the Greyhound agent in Laredo had been issued to Mr. H. 0.

LEE ,on 1 October 1963, for travel from Laredo to Dallas, Texas.
H. 0, LEE paid a total of 253.75 pesos ($20,30) in cash.
[Commission Exhibit No. 1166, pp.2-3.]

On 1 October 1963, OSWALD paid his hotel bill through
that night. [Commission Exhibit No. 2121, p. 54.] The next
morning (2 October) OSWALD took a taxi to the Transportes del
Norte bus terminal to board bus no. 332, scheduled to leave
at 0830 for Nuevo Laredo. At about 0135, on 3 October, OSWALD
crossed the International Bridge from Nuevo Laredo into Texas.

Wore khakis and sport shirt." Thus on 8 October 1963,
the Mexico City Station reported by cable to Headquarters
the following initial information on Lee Harvey OSWALD:

, (1) On 1 October 1963, an American male who
spoke broken Russian and said his name was Lee
OSWALD (phonetic), stated he had been at the Soviet
Embassy on 28 September where he spoke with a Consul
whom he believed to be Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV,
Subject asked the Soviet guard [Ivan] OBYEDKOV, who
answered, if there was anything new regarding the
‘telegram to Washington. OBYEDKOV upon checking said
nothing had been received yet, but the request had
been sent. )

(2) The Mexico City Station said it had photo-
graphs of a male who appeared to be an American en-
tering the Soviet Embassy at 1216 hours, leaving at
1222 on 1 [sic - 2] October. Apparent age 35, athletic
build, circa 6 feet, receding hairline, balding top.
Wore khakis and sport shirt.

(3) No local dissemination made by the Station.

[MEXI-6453 (IN 36017), 9 October 1963, 00432Z.]

The day following receipt of the above cable, the WH
Division, which was responsible for taking action, dissemi-
nated this report to the Department of State, the FBI, and
the Navy Department by routine electrical transmission,
adding some collateral details drawn from a preliminary
file review:

(1) On 1 October 1963 a reliable sensitive source
in Mexico reported that an American male, who identified
himself as Lee OSWALD, contacted the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City inquiring whether the Embassy had received

any news concerning a
14-00000

~

-~6-

telegram which had been sent to Washington.

The American was described as approximately

35 years old, with an athletic build, about

6 feet tall, with a "receding" hairline.

(23) It is believed that OSWALD may be iden-

tical to Lee Henry [sic] OSWALD, born on 18

October 1939 in New Orleans, Louisiana, a

former U.S. Marine who defected to the Soviet

Union in October 1959 and later made arrange-

mants through the United States Embassy in

Moscow to return to the United States with his

- Russian-born wife, Marina Nikolaevna PUSAKOVA .

[sic] and their child.

(3) The information in paragraph (1) is being

disseminated to your representatives in Mexico

City. Any further information received on this

subject will be furnished you. This information

is being made available to the Immigration and

Naturalization Service.

[DIR 74673, 10 October 1963]

Although the reaction of the Headquarters desk
Waas"by the book'' and in good time, there were a number of
errors in this advisory to the departments which, on the
record, were concerned with the OSWALD case:

a. OSWALD's middle name was given incorrectly as
"Henry" for Harvey. The reason for this mistake is sim-
plicity itself. The sheet opening the file on OSWALD on
9 December 1960 had been erroneously inscribed ‘OSWALD,

Lee Henry". That sheet - unchanged except for the notation
of the error - is still the first sheet in the OSWALD file.

b. His wife's maiden name was misspelled: "PUSA-
KOVA" for PRUSAKOVA. .

Neither of these errors are significant (though they |
persist in the Headquarters communicationstthroughout the
month). More important was:

c. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's report,
