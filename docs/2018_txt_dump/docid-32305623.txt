ALEX: I°ll talk te him ahd have him go to JOE and
\ ; let JOE send him im. Or, I could” send him
to the lawyer, but I’m just trying to —
avoid that question if it came up..
HUMPHREYS: «XE don't think it will, but it’s good.

‘ALEK: We got to get another witzess.

_ HUMPHREYS: Another one! We got to get a lot of them!
ALEX: And we got to get them before they get them.
HUMPHREYS: Yeah, You know who we could get to be a
ee witness? He'd be a hell of a witness.
ALEX: Who?

HUMPHREYS: CLAIR.

The reference of ALEX to MONAGHAN is probably a
reference to ROBERT F. MONAGHAN, an Assistant United States
Attorney in Chicago. The reference to CLINTON
is a reference to STANFORD. CLINTON, who is an attorney in Chicago,
and whe is one of the attorneys. representing ANTHONY ACCARDO in
his pending trial. It is obvious that the conversation-concerns
the trial of ACCARDO, who has been indicted for fraudulently
charging expenses for the use of his automobile which h@ claims
he used to sell "Foxhead Fourhundred" beer for the Premium
Beer Sales, Incorporated. It is apparent that ALEX amd —
HUMPHREYS are concerned with finding witmesses whe will back
up ACCARDO’s claim that he used the car during the course -
of selling "Foxhead Fourhundyed. id

The Yorkshire referred to is believed to be the
Yorkshire Room Restaurant located at 2842 North Sheridan Road
in Chicago. “+

The reference to STEVE by ALEX midway in the conversation
is probably a reference to STEVE DE KOSTA. It is noted
that DE KOSTA is ostensibly the owner and manager of the Huckster's
. Restaurant in Chicago. According to PCI TURA SATANA, a
oe burlesque dancer, who is intimately friendly with HENRY SUSK ;
and also well acquainted with Gus ALEX, the Huckster's is operated
