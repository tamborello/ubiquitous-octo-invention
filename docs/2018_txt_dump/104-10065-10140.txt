MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Raymond A. Warren
: Chief, Latin American Division

FROM : Norpert A. Shepanek
. Office of the Special Assistant
to the DDO for External Oversight

SUBJECT * ; House Select Committee on
Assassinations' Questions

1. ‘The House Select Committee on. Assassinations (HSCA)
staff has passed the questions outlined below which we. are
unable to answer. The questions obviously derive from their
research of our files and/or revelations made during inter-
rogation of our personnel. Perhaps Mexico Branch or Mexico
City Station could shed some light on these questions.

2. The first question relates to telephone taps. The
HSCA was provided access to the take from three taps, but HSCA
believes that there were five taps. They want to know about
the other two taps - what lines were tapped, location, time
period, and period in operation.

3. The HSCA staff learned that there were (unilatéral }
taps in Mexico City. Were these on official Cuban or Soviet
installations? (There would be little interest if these were
against private residences.)

4. In the photo coverage of the Cuban Embassy, there
were three camera’ positions. Photos made available to the
Committee appear to be only from two camera positions. Where
is the coverage from the third position? What dates was it
in operation?

5. There was a second position from which photos were

made of the Soviet Embassy which carried the cryptonym LILYRIC.
They would like to see the LILYRIC take.
