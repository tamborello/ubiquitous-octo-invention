 

What we have.so far on Bernard de Torres is this: He ‘showed
_ up in New! Orleans very early in Garrison's investigation
- Claiming he-had important information. - He said he'was
a private|detective inMiami, and wanted to help. .Garrison -
recalls he mentioned the hame of State Attorney Richard -
Gerstein .as.an entree. Miami newspaper clippings at, the...
time describe Torres as the "military coordinator of |‘  -
|, Brigade 2506." He refused.to. comment’ to reporters on his
rolesin Garrison's investigation’: "He said some of the _:
“angles: were 'classified,!such as reports of an Oswald.
visit here." -. [My ‘personal opinion is that, from :my experience,,.

    

>

 

 

“anyone who.comes up witha story. putting Oswald‘ in Miami_
isa source of. misinformation.]: However, according to the |
Clippings: "Torres was among :a group of .ten Cubans: who
\ helped Secret. Service men protect President Kennedy when he
" “vd Sited Miami- four days before his assassination."” :

  

. story of- localites assisting Secret.Service men ‘hé in’Miami
_ on’Kennedy's visit was.Jerry’ Patrick Hemming, who says he. also..*-
‘was involved in that security effort. laml Police:reports .
. list Torres. as an associate of Ansélmo Leon-Alliegro,’ an old -
“pal of Hemming's. Police once founda quantity of explosives
and, weapons in Alliegro's home, Alliegro said théy belonged  - -

“another Otero lead, Norman Diaz.. Diaz is the father-in-law ~~
of Miami City Commission Manolo Rebozo, a close. associate of

‘Today, Garrison feels. that Torres was one of his early sources
