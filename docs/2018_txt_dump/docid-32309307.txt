of the Meissner family. To further explore the possibility
that Meissner might be utilized for the benefit of Hoffa in
connection with the cases pending in Federal courts in
Nashville and Chicago, Verhelle indicated that he would soon
confer with an attorney who was not identified by name but
who was referred to as the "quarterback" of the team of more
than 30 attorneys who reportedly are working on these cases

- for Hoffa. Verhelle anticipated that after so conferring,

it would be determined whether Meissner might be able to

help Hoffa through efforts directed toward one or more members

of a jury or toward the judge himself.

Verhelle allegedly favored trying to make an
"arrangement" with Judge Austin through Meissner on the basis

o£ being an “old friend", and it was Verhelle"s feeling that

‘Lf Judge Austin were to make some rather minor procedural

mistake that would cause a mistrial, such a “human error" on
the part of the judge would not destroy his career but would

‘be of great value to Hoffa. Verhelle indicated that in

return for such favors to Hoffa, “they would be happy to

pay the persons responsible for the favors. Tentative .
arrangements were made for Verhelle to attempt to meet with
Meissner in Chicago in the near future, to discuss the
possibility of a Pension Fund loan to purchase the building
at 130 North Franklin and also the possibility of Meissner
being of assistance to Hoffa in regard to pending court cases.

_Verhelle also intimated that he has a number of bank
accounts in Switzerland and that he handles some of these
accounts for Hoffa.
