have of Hunt's assignment i in Spain in mid-1965 to the fall of 1966. re

ae ‘ assignment. In June 1965 he moved from WH Division with Des”
ee FitzGerald when he became the DD/P. At about that time |

and ten days of religious observations following that.~ He was back
in mid-June and in end out from then on as. he got ready to attend
the National War Gollege which began in August. He did not xeturn
to that office until the end of June 1966. . Se

was ADDP with Helms moving up to be DDCI. He thought it entirely —
