€ FACTUAL BACKGROUND.

Boris and’ Anna Tarasoff were stationed in Mexico City in 1963.
They were the Russian: translators used to translate and transcribe the
Russian language portions of surveillance tapes. Hence, they have actual .
knowledge of a portion of that operation.

in an interview with members of this staff the Tarasoffs said that
_ the tapes and Spanish language transcripts would be delivered to them on
the morning of one day by a person who worked on this operation. The next
day the Tarasoffs would return the tape, Spanish transcript and the completed
translation/transcript of the Russian language portions. The Tarasoffs

said. that. they made an original copy and two carbons of every transcription.

 

The original and one copy was retained by the Tarasoffs. One carbon was.
turned over to their contact.

Mr. Tarasoff also said that he was responsible for trying to identify,

_ by their voices, the Soviet Embassy personnel involved in conversations
which he transcribed.

The Tarasoffs, by the nature of their involvement in the operation, should
have some knowledge of some of the other individuals involved in this oper-
ation.

. The Tarasoffs said’ that the transcripts they prepared were literal
transcriptions as opposed to summaries. “They said that. they made no marginal -
comments on the body of the transcripts.

Mr. Tarasoff was assisted in translating and transcribing the tapes by

his wife, Anna ‘Tarasoff.

C . FACTUAL BACKGROUND.

The Tarasoffs do not remember identifying the voices of any of the
people with whom Oswald spoke prior to the assassination. They do not
remember ever being asked to do so after the assassination. “They do .
not remember ever being questioned before being contacted’ by HSCA

investigators.

C FACTUAL BACKGROUND

‘The Tarasoffs claim to remember translating and transcribing at least 2
conversations involving Oswald. They remember that the first one was fairly
short and routine. Oswald did not identify himself in this first conver-
sation. The second one was much longer and Oswald did identify himself ~
in this conversation. The Tarasoffs remember Oswald discussing his finan-
cial situation in this call. They deny making any editorial or marginal
comments in the transcription of this call.

The Tarasoffs remember ‘nothing unusual about the first call or the
circumstances around its delivery or transcription. The second call was
delivered to them and they were asked to transcribe the Oswald call as
quickly as possible. Their contact expressed a strong interest in the

7 identity of the caller and the substance of the call. The Tarasoffs
C translated and transcribed the call and returned the transcript on the ~
same day, using an emergency contact as opposed to waiting until the next
morning and using their standard contact.

It is not clear whether or not the Tarasoffs have any independent
memory of any other calls involving Oswald.

Exhibits are classified and will be added‘ at a later date. Questions

based on these exhibits will be asked.
