7 Mr. Goldsmith. With regard to the telephone tap opera-

except I think that from time to time, we might have taken

one tap off one line and put it on another. As far as the

‘unilateral taps, they were not constant. They were placed on

an individual for a length of time to gain information, about.

him, ° ‘his, habits, his family, his contacts, and then taken: oft

Mr. Goldsmith. By constant, what I mean is while the

tap was in operation on a ‘particular phone, it was con--

stantly. in effect? Whenever the phone call came in the tap

Me. Goldenith. _ Who made the ‘policy, decision as to whic
phones would be covered? .

Mr. Manell.. Well, it was basic practice that all of tnd

covered naturally and normally because that is what we

wanted to have reporting on. As far as changing from one

line to another, it would Have: been a mutual agreenent between

myself and win Scott, or Win might have decided. to change a |
