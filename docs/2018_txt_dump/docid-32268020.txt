2. Since Leber was transferred to Hgs. TAC at
Langley AFB in 1970, he only knew STANLEY for approximately
2-3.-months (exact time unknown). However, during this period
of time, LEBER does not recall any conversation with STANLEY
relative to the JFK assassination, Russia, Cuba and/or Mexico.

3. LEBER stated that Capt. STANLEY was an ex-enlisted
man who had served 16 years in the Army and was about 38 years
of age in 1970. He was possibly "r.i.f.'ed" from the service
in 1971 and was said to have had severe financial problems.

4. Further, it is believed that Capt. STANLEY left

the service and went to study law at the University of Miami

 

(Florida) in 1971.

5. Two servicemen were identified as having served
under Capt. STANLEY, namely Larry F. CAISON and Chief Master
Sergeant Charles FISCHER, about whom, it was felt, additional
information could be secured.

Following the termination of the interview, assistance
was provided in obtaining the addresses of the above-referenced
servicemen:

Lt. Col. Rudolph D. GOBEL, Jr., Retired
2671 Merrie Oaks Road

Winter Park, Florida 32789

Larry F. CAISON

1508 Gronin Drive

Hampton, Virginia

At the present time the whereabouts of Sgt. FISCHER

 

and Capt. STANLEY are unknown.
