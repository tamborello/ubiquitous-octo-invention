MEMORANDUM FOR: Howard K. ELBROFF | (De Not Reproduce ”
SUBJCCT : Request for Receipt of Cperational Funds

1. Recently Elaine R. Lenay, of KUTUBE, advised that on
15 February 1962, during the course of your developing a potential
agent of interest to KUTUBE in New York City, N. Y., she
advanced $50. 00 to you for this use. Because of operational
reasons at the time, it was not feasible to obtain a receipt for
- this money.

2. Elaine R. Lenay advises that she recently submitted
a claim for the $50.00 in conjunction with her travel voucher
for the trip during which this contact wae made. The above was
disallowed by the Finance Division on the grounds that neither a
receipt nor an accounting was available.

3. Until euch time as a receipt can be obtained from you,
the claim for $50.00 is being disallowed. Therefore,it would
be appreciated if you would forward such a receipt at your earliest

convenience.
