Rerep SA RICHARD GORDON DOUCE, Pittsburgh, 4/4/58, and Bulet
to Pittsburgh, 4/30/58.

The matter ef subject's conferences with his confederates at
the Ken Iron and Steel Company, New Kensington, Pa., has
peen the subject of considerable discussion among agents
assigned to Top Hoodlum investigations in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
with respect to’ the possible use of unusual investigative

techniques.

s
NN

Several preliminary surveys have been made of the Ken Iron and
Steel Company for the purpose of determining whether unusual
investigative techniques could be established. Unfortunately
adequate security cannot be guaranteed; consequently, confidential
or unusual investigative techniques are not being considered :
at this time. :

The long distance telephone conversation between subject and
the individual referred to as-{MQUIE” of Chicago, Tllinois,
regarding the gambling situation in Havana;Ctba, was _
partially overheard by TOM LATTOS,” the roommate of PCI MIKE

_ .ZERVOS. LATTOS, according to. ZERVOS, heard nothing additional f
“ ‘ag to the substance of the long distance telephone conversation H
and would not be in a position to obtain additional information |

  

. regarding the call even if he wanted to. ZERVOS has naturally
protected his confidential relationship to the Bureau during
his friendship with LATTOS dnd. feels it highly inadvisable to
press LATTOS for additional information that he does not
possess at the risk of arousing his suspicions. ZERVOS also
feels that since he is the only one who is aware of the fact
that LATTOS overheard a portion of the conversation between
subject and "LOUIE" an interview of LATTOS, the original source
of information, would greatly endanger. his position as an

informant. oy eg Feo ey oD
