from the National Penitentiary in Port
au~Prince to Haiti's General Hospital.

No proper trial was held.

Mr, Carles is suffering from an
acute liver infection acd the physi-
cians zttexting him have warned that
he will die unless he's allowed to tra-
vel abroad for special treatment,

This isn’t the first time Mr, Char-
Jes was teken from his cell to a hos~
pital, Last year he was rushed to
Haiti's military hospital for treapment.
of the same disease.

out that Narie-Denise Duvalier Domi~
mique, a friend of Mr. Charles, has
often interceded for him.
