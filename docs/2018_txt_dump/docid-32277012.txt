. Phone calls from Phonttxpena on 11/22/63

On November 22, 1963, Jack Eurich, owner of the Hi-Liter Bar in Phoenix,
Arizona reported that aman had placed a call from a pay phone in his -estab-
lishment to a "rifle range in Dallas" shortly after the assassination. Eurich

“had never seen the man before, but.he was able to give a.description of the
man' s physical appearance, clothing, and automobile he drove.

The F.B,I. checked the records:of that phone and found four calls to Dallas
had been made that ‘day. Three of the calls’ were made person to person to
Jacqueline Kennedy at Parkland Hospital. Strangely enough, phone records show
that two of the calls, both of them not completed because the line was busy,
were placed minutes before the assassination at 12:14 and 12:20pm CST. The
other call to Parkland, which was completed, was placed at 12:37 CST. The caller,

whose name is deieted from the F.B.I. report, was then connected to a “security
officer. t CD 1107,- PS: 742)

On 11/28/63, the *.B.I. interviewed a William Mortimer Means, who fit Eurich's
description well. Means was an unemployed painter who claimed to have come to
Phoenix because of his emphysema. Means admitted calling Parkland Hospital
from the Hi-Liter Bar on 11/22, but his explanation was inadequate. He claimed
that after hearing of the President's shooting he became so upset he decided
to call the hospital in Dallas to see.if it were true. Means denied asking for
Jacqueline Kennedy.

. Means ‘does not appear to have been confronted with the phone company records
showing that two phone calls. to Parkland were attempted before he could have
possibly heard about the assassination. It is of note that the. Bureau's
‘report’ on this call; found in-cd@: 301, mentions only the completed 12:37 call,

A few more pages are found in CD 1107 on the call, but the. document showing’ the
other two calls was not released until earlier this year.

\Phe other call to Dallas from the Hi-Liter in Phoenix on “4122 was to. ‘phone
number 368-0096. The timé of the call. apparently was not recorded by the = :
Operator and the identity of the subscriber was not ‘given in the. report. Cne
possible clue to. who it, “might be, however, is found in the interview of
Means. The’ report. relates:

“Means denied: calling any other telephone number in Dallas’ on 11/22/63 and
said he does not know anyone named VAL MAE STONE. He says the only Turf bar
he knows of is in Billings, Montana." .

This is a’rather intriguing paragraph. The 1963- Dallas city Directory lists
a Val Stone as the wife of John’ E, Stone, whose occupation is given there.
as manger of Sol's turf Bar. When a gambler named Sidney Seidband was. arrested
in Oklahoma City in ‘1 59, the F.B. I. obtained a list of gambling acquaintances
from him in the: Dalla rea. ‘The list included Jack Ruby, Lewis MeWillie, .
“who ran gambling operations at the Tropicana in Havana, and Johnnie Eli Stone
and Sal Solomon, cojowhers of the Turf ‘bax. (See CE 1693) At the time of
the assassination, Se and ‘resided dn. Phoenix. i . :

’ Jack Ruby, is Known to nave visited ‘the Turf bar on 11/23/63. It isjalso qui te!
likely that Ruby was at Parkland Hospital minutes aftér the assass ination, given |
