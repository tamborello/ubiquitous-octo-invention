2. Will continue efforts to develop sources
in a position to furnish continuing intelligence information
concerning the activities of SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA as a
"Commission" member and "family boss," as well as
identification of "family" members.

ADMINISTRATIVE ©

‘Philadelphia airtel to, Pittsburgh dated 8/25/63
makes reference to New York airtel of 8/5/63 in which —
information was received from NY 4008-PC in which the informant
identified a photograph of SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA as
being identical with an individual known to him as "BIG °
JOHN; who controls Palumbo's Restaurant in Philadelphia,
as well as shylocking, bookmaking, and racketeering in
Philadelphia. ;

‘ Investigation by the Philadelphia Office
reflects that SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, "Commission" member,
Pittsburgh Division, is not associated with Philadelphia ‘
racket activities nor apparently identical with the
individual observed. by the informant. ;

Information in this report making reference to
WILLIAM "BIG BILL" LIAS has already been furnished to the-
Bureau and Detroit by Cleveland; therefore, no copy of this
report is being furnished to Detroit.

Leads have previously been set out to Chicago to
further identify PAOLINELLO, a gunman allegedly hired by
NICOLO GENTILE in the past, as well as his relationship
with SIGNOR D'ANDREA, former head of the Chicago "family."

' Other information contained in this report
Suggesting possible leads or investigation by other offices
has been previously set out in substantive case files
pertaining to individuals whose names appear in this report.

Pittsburgh report of 7/31/63 contains additional
information not included in this report which was submitted
since 6/1/63.
