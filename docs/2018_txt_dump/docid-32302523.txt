Subject GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka
AR .

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka
AR

On 5/12/61, PCI JIM KELLY, aka, and PG 612-C, both engaged in
numbers racket activities in New Kensington, Pa., advised
as follows: :

Since the article appeared in Pittsburgh newspapers concerning
the Government's intention to have all investigative agencies
cooperate in an attempt to combat organized crime, word has
been passed around in New Kensington gambling circles each
person so engaged should be particularly alert for the presence
of strangers who could be Federal agents. Each numbers writer,
horse bookie and sports bookie has been cautioned not to accept
pusiness from people with whom they are not already acquainted
and they are not to accept any telephone wagers unless they

are absolutely certain of the identity of the person calling.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
