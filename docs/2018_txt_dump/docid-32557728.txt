JOSEPH MOODY, U. Ss: Coast Guard, Miami Beach,
Florida, who is a diver attached to this Coast Guard Station,

After. examining the underside of the “Caribbean
Venture”, WoopY stated that although the visibility was very
poor due to the murky water and igeation of the ship, he E
would estimate that the hole. blown in the bottom was approxi=.”
mately three feet wide and five feet long. He stated this
hole was located amidships slightly to the starboard side, .
and appears to have oceurfed in the area where two strainers:
er grills are located over the main water injection intake...
(After reviewing a sketeh of the ship shown to him by the
Engineer, MOODY stated this would appear to be in the area
of ribs 55, 56, and 57}. MOODY stated that the strainers,

the bottom of the ship with numerous bolts and that to take
off one of these grills or strainers js a three or four.
hour job, He stated that during the eourse of his Coast -
Guard duties, he has, on occasion, removed such a strainer
and that is on what he bases his opinion.

 

 

MOODY advised that after observing the hole, he
would say that the explosion was caused by an explosive.
' Which was attached to one of the strainers or grilis; ‘inas
much as all metal in that area was blown inward. He stated
he could not locate either one of the grills which should
be cevering the intake, and that he presumes they were
either blown into the ship, ao blown into pieces and fell
to the bottom of the harbor.

     

 

MOODY stated that in his opinion, the explosive
was attached to the grill, probably either by wire of some
type of. toggling device by a swimmer who used air tanks.

the Dade County Public Safety Department to enter and
observe the interior. He stated, however, that due

_ to the poor visibility, approximately one foot, he was

unable to ascertain if any parts of the hull, the strainer,
or explosive devices were located inside.

MOODY stated that judging from his own past
experience, he would say that the explosive was attached
to the strainer or grill by an experienced skin diver,
He stated this diver would, of necessity, have had to
use underwater swimming tanks inasmuch as he knows of
no one.who could have accomplished such a feat without
the aid of tanks, He stated that he believes that in this
ship, or any other ship, the injection intakes can be
located by an experienced diver by merely locating the
smokestack on the ship and proceeding across the hull
dead center from the stack. The intake could then be
located by swimming either 15 or 20 feet fore or aft
from that section, MOODY stated, however, that in’
order to iocate anything on the underside of the ship,
it takes a very experienced diver either using the seams
of the ship, or a compass in order to keep from petting
disoriented due te the darkness.

MOODY stated that he believes that this hold
was made by a "shape charge".

> y0sern. woopr, u. 8. Coast Guard, Miami Beach, :
Florida, who is a diver attached to this Coast Guard Station,
was. interviewed concerning. the size.and nature of the-hole ©
im the bottom of the "Caribbean Vi enture." MOODY has seven .
utr e experience and ‘during. the course. of this
rience has conducted a. vari t of u derwat
for. the U. 8, Coast Guard, sty of un or missions

 

: After examining the underside of the "Caribbean
Venture”, #OODY stated that although the visibility was very
poor due to the murky water and location of the ship, he
would estimate that the hole blown in the bottom was approxi=
mately three feet wide and five feet long. He stated this
hole was located amidships slightly to the starboard side,
and appears to have oceurfed in the area where two strainers:
er grills are located over the main water injection intake.
(After reviewing a sketch of the ship shown to him by the ~~~
Engineer, MOODY stated this would appear to be in the area
of ribs 55, 56, and 57}. MOODY stated that the strainers,
er grills that are attached to the intakes are attached to
the bottom of the ship with numerous bolts and that to take
off one of these grills or strainers is a three or four.
hour job. He stated that during the course of his Coast
Guard duties, he has, on occasion, removed such a strainer
and that is on what he bases his opinion.

 

HOODY advised that after observing the hole, he
would say that the explosion was caused by an explosive
which was attached to one of the Strainers or grills, ‘inas=
much as all metal in that area’ was blown inward. He stated
he could not locate either one of the grills which should
be covering the intake, and that he presumes they were .
either blown into the ship, @& blown into pieces and fell
to the bottom of the harbor.

 

  

 

MOODY stated that im his opinion, the explosive
was attached to the grill, probably either by wire of some
type of toggling device by a swimmer who used air tanks.

MOODY advised that the hole in the bottom of the
