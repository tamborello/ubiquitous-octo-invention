MM 92-88

As a result of this proposal, DE JOSEPH arranged a
meeting between the informant and TRAFFICANTE, The informant,
DE JOSEPH, and IRVING FEINBURG, an acquaintance of the informant
who is connected with Escott Construction Co., Miami Beach,
went to Sonny's Italian Restaurant, 247 23rd St., Miami
Beach, on the night of 8/30/62..

According to the informant, FEINBURG went only at
the informant's invitation and did not even know who TRAFFI-
CANTE was. They were met at Sonny's Restaurant by TRAFFICANTE,
LOU BRADY, and JUDITH SALVAT, who appeared to be the girlfriend
of TRAFFICANTE,

At this meeting the proposed setting up of the
gambling ship to be operated off the Fla, Keys was discussed
by the informant, TRAFFICANTE, and BRADY, ‘TRAFFICANTE agreed
to consider arranging financing for the gambling ship and in-
structed the informant to give him more specific details,
particularly as to arrangements that could be made for securing
a suitable ship. They also discussed the possibility of con-
structing a hotel in Martinique, and Escott entered into this
discussion, TRAFFICANTE, however, was not agreeable to this
Suggestion. -

 

According to the informant BRADY did the majority.
of the talking for TRAFFICANTE and gave the impression that
he was trying to impress TRAFFICANTE in the way he talked and
discussed the matter with the informant.

‘ The informant expects future meetings between himself
and TRAFFICANTE, or one of his representatives, regarding this
matter,

On 9/4/62, the informant advised that he has negotiated
with LEWIS FRAZIER, owner of the motor -vessel "Fleures" to buy
this vessel and have it converted into a gambling ship. The >
ship is 180' in length and would be capable of handling about =.
100 gambling passengers. It now Plies the Panamanian flag. The
price of the ship would be $35,000 and would cost $65,000 to ~
convert into a plush gambling ship. Informant said this had
been discussed with DE JOSEPH and DE JOSEPH told him he would
relay this on to his "associates,"
