5. In view of the above, it would appear that a separate
file did exist prior to November 1974, the contents of which
would appear to have now been consolidated within the above
noted official Office of Security file on ROSELLI. Further,
now anng. that the heretofore missing "Project Johnny" file is
now an official file, the conclusion may be drawn that all
Office of Security files relating to the MAHEU/ROSELLI matter
have been reviewed, and that the pertinent information contained
therein has been forwarded to the Inspector General for review.

6. It should be noted that in 1967 the Inspector General
conducted an investigation into the MAHEU/ROSELLI matter, and
in so doing collected numerous memoranda from the various
Agency components directly involved. As a result, additional
memoranda which may have previously been held separately by
the Director of Security, may be in the possession of the

Inspector General.
