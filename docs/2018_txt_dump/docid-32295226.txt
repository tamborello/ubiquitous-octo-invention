on to informant, ‘and finally admitted to ‘informant that
HERNANDEZ ‘just. did not care: for the informant. Informant \

. discussed the situation with MILLER and“ DOMINIC DIBELLA,

“who instructed informant to tell HERNANDEZ that .if he dia

‘not "sit still”. he; HERNANDEZ, would be "hit." _DIBELLA .

- told informant he received the go “ahead © to Say ‘this from

-'ROSS PRIO. - : oe

Informant relates, that after. this, original difficulty,

Ke and HERNANDEZ, * ‘have an "understanding" so. that he is now =
‘on friendly terms with him. “HERNANDEZ has ‘told informant,
that he has worked in the: past. with .and- for SANTO, TRAFFICANTE,
both in Miami. and in. Cuba; He did‘ not: ‘indicate the present
rélationship: between ‘himself and® TRAFFICANTE, but tried to
leave the’ impression that a degree of relatbaship does’ oo
‘exist. = :

The informant advised on April 9, 1964, that FRANK.
HERNANDEZ, previously’ mentioned as being closely associated
with SANTO ‘TRAFFICANTE, recently made a trip to New York
with BERT DUBBIN for the purpose ‘of making’ arrangements :
to work on ‘the new liner being purchased: by DUBBIN, the |
"Italia," to be docked off of Freeport, Bahamas: FRANK
MILLER™ told the. informant that TRAFFICANTE | ‘advised MILLER
during a previous’ meeting that if anything’ Should ‘happen:
.to FRANK.HERNANDEZ, the: same thing would’ happen to the

- individual responsible, ‘apparently referring ‘to the veiled
threats ‘by. the’ informant concerning the help of HERNANDEZ.

reasonabl hat SANTO TRAFFICANTE and |BENJAMIN H.. GOLOB -
‘are acquainted with each other but it’ ‘appears that GOLOB

BRUNO: than subject. . : .

  

‘ Departmental Attorney WILLIAM S, KENNEY, with
whom liaison .is maintained by the. Miami Office, has
furnished no additional information regarding ANTONIO
‘IBARRO, previously reported as allegedly being a half-
brother. of the subject.

With regard to the individual known as "Chopper"

Miami letter dated 1 Jaly. 31, 1964 set forth the
following: © ws ; : ;

The information set forth below is the result
of contact with confidential informant CG’6538-C~-TE, .
on March 19, and March 25, 1964, ‘at Miami, Florida. - In:
view of the fact that this ‘informant : is intimately involved
in the information which he has furnished, it is requestéd
that this information be placed on the ‘Administrative pages
of: the” report” and not in the, details. .

Informant is now involved .- full time on the
- "Calypso. Liner" Cruise Boat operating ‘between Miami, ~~
y -Florida, and® Bimini; Bahamas, B.W:I. His: full time partner
in this venture is "FRANK MILLER. ‘previously described by the
informant as "bag man" for Broward County SO... In addition,
informant has agreed to pay DOMINIC DIBELLA ‘one-half of-his,
informant ' S, share which will go toward retirement. of his
debt to the ROSS.PRIO. Organization. As' was stated-earlier,
this venture is a modified version of the “Razzle Dazzle,”
with the exception that prizes are given in. the form of.
perfume; ‘cameras, watches, etc. These prizes, however,
may be exchanged for’ cash, which is usually the case. HENRY
DUBBINS, operator of the "Calypso," has issued specific
instructions to informant that the game must be run in
such a manner as'to not cause heat to be. brought to bear
by, irate victims, and as a ‘result, the game is quasi--
legitimate. :
‘Informant is now in a position whereby he has ;
saved $1,100 for DIBELLA, which will be given to him upon
his next. ‘trip to Miami, which will be. momentarily: :

Informant states there was a considerable amount
of difficulty in finally. proceeding with the. game, in that one
FRANK HERNANDEZ.‘ DUBBINS' representative’ on’ the. boat, was. .
nono Sa sp EC Lous ‘of -the-informant- ‘and- FRANK .MILLER--and:-passed-~-on-
these suspicions to DUBBINS, stating that informant was
