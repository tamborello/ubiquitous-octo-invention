RY ReBulet, 3/10/64, denying Miami request for

appropriate mail covers in this case,

: From the outset, EVELIO ALPIZAR PEREZ was

requested to obtain the identity of the bank on whom

Q the checks in this case were drawn. Unfortunately, he
was unable to recall the specific name of the bank on
which the two checks observed by him were drawn, or

S the signature of the maker. He did recall that the bank

had the word "National" in the name, but he was not

absolutely positive about this.

   

On the basis of his information, the records

| of all logical banks in Miami were checked with negative
results. It is believed that ORLANDO BOSCH and the

treasurer of the MIRR may have a special checking account

in the name of some relative, friend, or other member ‘
of the MIRR, but that most likely, in any event, the

a address would be the same as one of those listed on the
FD-227's dated March 3, 1964, submitted to the Bureau

by this office.
