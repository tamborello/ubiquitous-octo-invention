It is believed the-purpose of this investigation,

é namely to determine cubjechid(pabpyactivities in Cuba fand his
potential as an informant § BELG Jhest be served by an nterview
by an Agent of this off . Consideration has been given to this —
matter and it is not believed that proposed interview is un-
desirable in any respect.

VIII. As stated above, it is believed that requested interview
will best serve the purpose of this investigation.

Ix. If Bureau authority to interview subject is granted,
subject will be approached by a: Special Agent of the Dallas Office
who speaks the Spanish language for the stated purpose of inter-
viewing him to determine the facts of his background and the
extent of his knowledge of persons in the United States who are
possibly CASTRO agents.
