1. INCA is an anti«Communist propaganda organization
with headquarters in New Orleans, that disseminates English
and foreign language propaganda tapes and ‘films on a world-
wide basis, conducts public forums of an extremist
political nature, etc. The organizational impetus and funds
apparently come from wealthy New Orleans figures including
Dr. Alton OCHSNER, of the OCHSNER CLINIC, and Willard E.
ROBERTSON. In recent years funds have been supplied by the
SCHICK SAFETY RAZOR COMPANY. An INCA letterhead listing all
the officers and officials has been requested from JMWAVE,
which has had some casual correspondence with the organiza- ,
tion concerning Miss Juanita CASTRO,

2. There is no indication of any Agency relationship
with INCA prior to January 1965 when INCA sponsored Miss _
CASTRO's appearance in New Orleans. At that tine| -ws—

La lvhe functioned as Miss CASTRO's business manager Wa
involved with INCA officials in planning the New Orleans
visit where Miss CASTRO was given an award at a dinner
sponsored by INCA. The dinner, which was attended by civic

leaders and representatives of all news media, took place
shortly after Miss CASTRO's defection and there was

considerable interest in her appearance. INCA was particularly

interested since it had distributed hundreds of English
and Spanish language tapes containing her statements when
she was surfaced in Mexico. In October 1966 INCA again
requested that Miss CASTRO appear as a guest speaker in
major American cities in connection with the release of

the INCA motion picture production "HITLER IN HAVANA",
Following various reviews “of the film, JMWAVE decided the
film would probably become controversial and it would be
inadvisable to permit Miss CASTRO to accept the invitation.
Because of INCA's extremist political orientation, JMWAVE
has wanted to_avoid any more involvement between Miss CASTRO
and INCA and in his capacity as business
manager, has managed to prevent this. There has been only
one casual contac@ between our asset and Edward BUTLER,
Executive Vice-Président of INCA, since Miss CASTRO's 1965
New Orleans trip. This took place recently when BUTLER was
in the area promoting the "HITLER IN HAVANA" film.

 

 

3. According to JMWAVE, INCA officials have never
indicated in any way that they are aware of Agency control
and direction of Miss CASTRO or her business agent, and there
is no indication that INCA officials have had any official
contact with Agency officers.
