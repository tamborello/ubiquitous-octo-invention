I, David A. Phillips Â» on becoming dissociated
with the 'TALENT-KEYHOLE" programs in the ''TALENT' Control
System realize that by virtue of my duties with those programs have
been the recipient of information and intelligence which concerns the
present and future security of the United States of America. I am
aware that the unauthorized disclosure of such information is
punishable under the Espionage Laws.

Accordingly, I solemnly swear or affirm that I will never
divulge, publish or reveal either by word, conduct or any other
means any classified information relative to 'TALENT-KEYHOLE"
materials or sources unless specifically authorized in each case by
the Director of Central Intelligence or his designee.

Ido not have any documents or materials in my possession,
classified or unclassified which are the property of or belong in the
custodial responsibility of the ''TALENT" Control System.

I understand that travel to hazardous or denied areas including

the USSR, Communist China, Sino-Soviet-satellite areas and such
other areas as may be determined by the United States Intelligence
Board constitutes security hazards. I recognize that prior to
undertaking travel to these areas I am to inform the 'TALENT'
Control Officer or "TALENT" Security Officer responsible for
having obtained my special clearances. This requirement will
remain in effect for a minimum of one year from thig date.
