These's nothing outstanding about Tarasoff - just an average joe trying to make
a living and without the ambition, energy, perspicdity to make use of a saleable
article: knowledge of Russian, Physically he'e sort of soft, tends to be over-

weight « he's about 5'8"tall, and about 190 in weight. His personality is on
the negative side, his manner dull. :

Tarasoff was. greatly interested in the possibility of working for the US Govern-
ment.. He wants that security. And he has about reached the end of the line
salary wise as a maintenance man or building superintendent. Tarasoff is will-
ing to work in D.C. but insists on a GS 7 because he has to support a wife and
two children. “He does not mind the sedentary aspects of Project Detail =I
doubt if he'd be interested in anything that wasn't sedentary, He also likeli the
the other aspects of Detail and I would think from talking with him that he
would be quite able to handle a job on fetail. He can translate « reads with

a great deal of ease. His PHS I notige indicated he's interested only in o/s =
this is not what he told me; he is interested in US also but he will go ofs if
necessary. of -

I recommend Tarasoff for a G5 7 on Project Detail. ,
