Gf wx. Blakey. Mr. Chairman, there are no further matters

that would require a vote by the committee. There are several

matters of information that might be appropriate to draw to
the committee's attention. The first is an informational
matter.
Mr. Ortez appeared before the Kennedy Subcommittee this
week and he is now being held by the United Spates Marshals.
: é. b
Mr. Fithian expressed some interest in perhaps pursuing

further investigation with him. If we were to do that, we

would have to keep him here for a while. Our own recommen-

dation is that we not pursue Mr. Ortez at least at this time >

until we have gotten further information back from the Cuban

government. .
I didn't-want to say anything to the Marshals about

taking him back or not taking him back until I brought it

up to the committee's attention, and really unless I hear an

expression from. the committees now as a whole that they would

want to take some action with him now as opposed to later, I’

think it would be appropriate for us to rélease him. I would

say that euphemistically since he is serving a 20° year term

! for airplane hijacking and it is doubtful that he is going to

| go anywhere, but nonetheless he will be available to the

committee really on command from here on out.

Chairman Stokes. I would think that that explanation

+ ought to suffice, and as long as he is available to the

committee 7 Mr. Fithian will take note 7 there should be
no problen.
G ur. Blakey. The next point which is again one of
7 =
information, the committee had voted to certify to the floor
Rowell :
Mr. Bask for contempt. During the recess we forwarded a

letter to the Speaker bringing this matter to his attention.

The committee should be made aware of the fact that the

it Speaker suggested that since the recess is so short that this

matter be brought to the floor and it is my understanding that

the e ghairman will bring the matter to the floor if not next
week the first part of the following week. The committees
should be informed of that.

The next matter is a delicate one; it is a continuation

|
of the conversation the committee had several days ago and it

deals with the possibility that Mr. Lane might represent the
entire Ray family and other people and that in that represen-

tation he might. attempt to orchestrate the testimony before

‘the committee. As the facts are developing, they do not

appear to be as sinister as we thought they might have been.

We have now learned that Mr. Lane will not represent
John Ray. We have also learned that Mr. Lane will not repre-
sent Carol Pepper. So what was. looking like it was going to
be very sinister is currently not looking that way at all and
perhaps this cup is passing in front of us.

The source of our information we had hoped would be
