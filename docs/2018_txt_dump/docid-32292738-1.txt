Information Concerning ANTHONY DETOLVE

During the afternoon of 2/4/63, former State ‘
Senatore FRED ROTI came in and conversed with MARCY concerning
the fact that ANTHONY DETOLVE is shooting off sparks and is
' angered due to the fact that it was his understanding that
‘he was not only to be made Alderman but Ward Committeeman
f of the First Ward as well. ROTI and MARCY's conversation
continued as follows: :

. NX . :

ROTI: He says he has $50,000 that JOHN was. supposed to
make him a judge and he (obs) him. He says JOHN
(obs) up on five things. He says I can't get along
‘with him, He says I hate his (obs) guts and he hates
my guts. He says it's never gonna work out.

' MARCY: Don't worry about it, you don't worry about nothin’.

ROTI: He says if he's gonna have his office here, I don’t
want my office here. , .

MARCY: I let him know. I told him, listen, there are
certain things I ain't never gonna tell you! You're
not supposed to know certain things. Now drop it
there! You were told that, I told you that. He says | -
I don't have to listen to you. I said that's
right ‘you don't, I'm not your boss. But if you don't
listen to me you! re making a big mistake! Then he

’ changed his tune. .

 

ROTI: “I think BERNIE GLICKMAN, who is real close to him, :
. ; may be giving him ideas. You know he's a nice | '
. fellow all right, but he's pretty cute. He says
; I didn't want this, he wanted a judgeship. '

- | BERNIE GLICKMAN is identical with a PCI of the
‘Chicago Office,
