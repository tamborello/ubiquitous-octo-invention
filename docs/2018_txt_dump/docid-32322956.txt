"Captain Hamilton indicated that the No. 2 man may
have been the one who accompanied "Meat Ball" to Chicago via
Tacoma, Washington. It is further believed that "Meat Ball”
remained in Tacoma after returning from Chicago and that the
No, 2 man returned to Los Angeles, Upon receiving this
information Director Duffy discussed the matter with Deputy
Superintendent Morris, and made a request that the Syndicated
Crime Unit of the 0.C.D. send a man to Los Angeles to work with
the Los Angeles IntéLligence:. Division to gather further infor~
mation in this matter.

“Set. Raymond O'Malley, Syndicate Crime Unit, was
sent to Los Angeles by airline that night. On October 25th,
Set. Raymond O'Malley, by telephone conversation disclosed the
following: ; :

"Captains informant's name is Percy Roberts, 2812 West
Caldwell, colored male, 47 years old, married, one child,
construction worker but unemployed at the present time, He is

that he heard this unknown man talking to another man known only
as "Doc,"; That this man told "Doc" that he had to leave town

Union man in Chicago and he furtherstated that if the man only
offered him $5,000 or $6,000 he would accept it. He stated he
was to leave for Tacoma from Los Angeles and then from Tacoma
to Chicago (it should be here noted that members of the Union,
other undesireable people have access to airplanes for their own
private use for charter, etc,, but that they also use commercial
airlines, he could have gone by any means to Tacoma and then
taken a commercial flight from Tacoma to Chicago.) This infor-
mant then went on to tell Sgt. O'Malley that on Friday night,
the 20th.of October he was at Malibu Beach from 8:30 p.m. til
10:30 p.m. He was there working as a waiter for a party of six
persons, this party included three men and three girls. One of

_ these men they have definitely identified as Anthony Doria. He

is supposed to be a big Union man out in California and at one
time was head of the Union which Mr. Incisco and Mr. Kilpatrick
are affiliated with. he informant states that this is the
