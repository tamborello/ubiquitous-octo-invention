Additional contacts with PG 601-C have produced
no information to.identify the labor consultant firm which

the Teamsters. Informant advised that in former conver-
sations with JAMES HALBERT he commented, "We finally got
around to fighting you guys with one of your own guys.
We got TONY PRO's boys working for us." Informant stated
he did not recall that HALBERT disclosed the name of the ‘
consultant firm and said he described it only as "TONY Va
PRO's firm." HALBERT also mentioned that AVERY and LEWIS, i.
who are negotiators representing A & P, reportedly were 2
called to New York City to confer with the labor consultant
firm prior to negotiations at Pittsburgh with the Teamsters.
