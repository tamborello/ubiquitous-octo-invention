that | time, DONOHUE attempted to learn the scope of the FBI
investigation concerning him. He asserted that individuais .
contacted by the FBI concerning him had advised him of these
contacts. When asked to be more specific by ASAC HOWELL, J
DONOHUE said that Mr. FRANK RUSSELL of Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
a diamond importer had informed him that he had been
interviewed by Milwaukee Agents concerning DONOHUE's
activities. DONOHUE asserted that RUSSELL,’ who had given him
business in the past, seemed reluctant to discuss business
opportunities with him in view of the FBI investigation.

/

It is noted that from 11/19/57, to 5/30/59 ,
DONOHUE was a Registered Agent for the Dominican Republic.

The investigation of DONOHUE indicates. that he ‘
is acquainted with United States Senator DENNIS CHAVEZ of
‘New Mexico and CHARLES DAVIS, Administrative Assistant to
Senator CHAVEZ.

The Bureau advised on 6/5/61, concerning DONOHUE
that in view of. CHARLES DAVIS' past record an interview of
him in the investigation of DONOHUE ‘did not appear advisable |
or would it likely be productive.

The records of the Willard Hotel as " veviewed on
1/24 and 27/61, reflected the following information concerning
CARLOS MARCELLO:

: MARCELLO checked into the Willard Hotel at 8:45 p.ms
1/22/61, andiwas assigned Suite 701- 02-041. Also checking
into the Willard with MARCELLO was one J; J. AMATO. MARCELLO
and AMATO checked out of the Willard at 4:00 p.m., 1/24/62. ©

The foregoing information concerning the Willard
Hotel was furnished on a strictly confidential basis by
Mr. ROLAND BEAULIEU, Executive Assistant Manager.

: WFO notes that the Willard Hotel meets the
description of a large well known hotel in the downtown area
with a flight of outside stairs leading to the lobby. This
would tend to collaborate PCI RUSSELL's information concerning
MARCELLO's stay in Washington, D. C.
