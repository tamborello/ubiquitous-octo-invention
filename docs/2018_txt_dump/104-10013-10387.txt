Edward 8. BUTLER (Paragraph 7 (A) of reference memorandum)

In January 1965 Subject's organization (INCA), sponsored
the New Orleans appearance of Juanita CASTRO shortly after
her arrival in the US. INCA had a particular interest in
Migs CASTRO since they distributed hundreds of tapes contah-
ing Migs CASTRO's declarations when she was surfaced in
Mexico. A JMWAVE asset, who is Mies CASTRO's business manager,
handled the planning and arrangements for the New Orleans
visit with INCA officials. The only subsequent contact
between the JMWAVE asset and Edward BUTLER occurred when
BUTLER was recently in Hiami promoting the INCA film on
"CASTRO-HITLER in HAVANA". See Attachment 2 for a summary
of the INCA organization.

Attachment 1
Sergio Vicente ARCACHA Smith (Enclosure 2 of reference memorandum)

DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba
im

1. Traces on ARCACHA do not reflect the date he first
arrived in the 0.5. However, he became the FRENTE REVOLU-
CIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (FRD) delegate in New Orleans prior
to the Bay of Pigs invasion and continued in that posibSion
until the FRD ceased to function. The FRD was the predecessor
of the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organized and
supported by the Agency. The organization was used as a
front for recruitment of Brigade 2506 for the invasion.
During this period ARCACHA reported to the FRD headquarters
in Miami through a post office box in Coral Gables, and
reportedly maintained extensive relations with the New
Orleans FBI and Immigration offices. Two of hie regular
FBI contacts were a Mr. De Bruce and the deceased Guy
Banister. :

2. ARCACHA was also one of the promoters of the .
FRIENDS OF DEMOCRATIC CUBA, INC (PRC) which was incorporated
in New Orleans on 6 January 1961. This organization was
ostensibly created by several New Orleans buginess and
political figures, including the deceased former FBI agent,
Guy Banister, te collect money to aid Cubang in their
fight against.Communism. According to the articies of
incorporation, these donations would also be used to support
the FRD and the funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,
leas a percentage to be retained by the FDC. Amn investi-
gation conducted by a reliable Miami Station asaet concluded
that. the FDC was organized strictly for the persenal gain
of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of
ARCACHA. The investigation produced no evidence that any
individual donations were ever solicited or received and
recomended that the funds of the Stevederes Union and the
books of the New Orleans Exporters Company be investigated
for evidence of persenal gain and possible evidence of
federal tax evasion, since both the president of the New
Orleans Exporters Company, Gerar@ F. Tunague, and the Chief
of New Orleans Stevedores Union, Alfred Chittenden, were
officials of the FDC. Approximately one month after the
FDC was created, strong criticigm from some prominent Cubans
put the organization out of business.

3. Information in an immigration card reflects that
ARCACHA travelled to Caracas, Venezuela at an unspecified
date. His address in Venezuela was HOTEL TSUNA, Caracas,
and hie US address was listed as 4523 Dupplesses Street,
New Orleans. Passport No. 00433.
