Re Chicago letter to Dallas, 9/5/69, (IO) and
Dallas letter to Chicago, 9/16/69.

Referenced Chicago letter furnished background
information and current activities regarding DOLAN while
in Chicago. Information was furnished by ROBERT E, FRANKLIN
(protect) presently at 2311 Commonwealth, Chicago, whom
DOLAN had lived with at 423 Wrightwood since coming to
Chicago in November, 1968.

According to FRANKLIN, DOLAN has since moved from
Chicago. FRANKLIN received a letter from DOLAN postmarked
August 2, 1969, from Denver, Colorado, with a Reno, Nevada
return address of 1275 Fairfield Avenue. It as to be noted
that this address is that of DOLAN’s mother. Enclosed in
this letter were two keys to the FRANKLIN’s apartment at
423 Wrightwood.

It is apparent that DOLAN is not establishing a
permanent residence in Chicago. Chicago feels that it
would be premature to transfer office of origin at this time
in view of information which would indicate DOLAN is no
longer in Chicago and in view of information furnished by
FRANKLIN that DOLAN travels extensively.

DOLAN SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS
AS HE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PARTICIPANT IN A ROBBERY
WITH FIREARMS AND HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE IN POSSESION OF

FIREAR! IN T RAST.
