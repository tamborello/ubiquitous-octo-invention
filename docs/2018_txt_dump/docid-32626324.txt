MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE

SUBJECT: Biological Warfare Ban;
; Campaign Against Biological Disease

In following through on my memorandum of May 29, I would
like to inform you that we have been working on a tentative
proposal for a Biology for Peace program. The tentative
proposal embodies your idea of a ban on biological warfare
coupled with a constructive international program in biology
and medicine. The ban and the cooperative international
program to combat plant, animal, and human diseases could
be one aspect of broad international scientific cooperation,

Our primary conclusion so far is that it would be
premature to consider the ban prior to a major re-evaluation
of U. S. policy regarding biological weapons and biological
warfare, The re-evaluation should encompass the technical
potential of biological weapons development and its political
and military implications. .It should take into account the
hazards of developing these relatively cheap instruments of
mass destruction including large-scale production and domestic
and extra-continental field testing of biological agents.

We plan’*to take the initiative in such a re-evaluation in the
immediate future. oo, :

If acceptance of a ban or other controls on biological
weapons is consistent with the results of the. re-evaluation,
the US will be confronted with a procedural problem in
arriving at an international agreement. The Soviets and
others might exploit the fact that the United States did
not ratify the Geneva Protocol of 1925 outlawing chemical
and biological warfare whereas the Soviet Union and other
