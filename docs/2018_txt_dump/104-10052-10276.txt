The tough problex, of cowrse, wlll be to sanitize the paper
without downgrading the operations. The essence of the message is.
that so much can be done, and dene gell, by relatively fewrpeople,

E@ might omi¢ all references te Latin Auerica, the Spuntsh luntguage,

aperations. We will be guided by your wishes in this and other aapects
of the paper.
