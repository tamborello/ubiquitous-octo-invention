GARCIA voluntagily told FIQKIE he had been {to DR at

$100,000.00 to deliver D'ALESSANDRO to DR. He said idea »
was discussed that D'ALESSANDRO might be lured te DR
by getting him to lead an expedition against DR which
would be trapped by DR in which event reward might go as
high as $150,000.00. GARCIA said he did mot like idea
and had backed owt of dt but volunteered to do anything
he could to help U. S. When asked by FICKIE if he could
‘get back "in" with persons behind plan, GARCIA indicated
he probably could. FICKIE believed GARCIA intended to
get back "in" cbrough FONDEUR.

 

It would appear that since GARCIA has discussed
this matter with FICKIE he is not likely to engage in any
kidnaping plot cf D'ALESSANDRO, but is possibly now talk-

is interviewed by FBI. He indicated he hoped that through

BARTONE's associate iu Miami, EDWARD BROWDER, who has been
previously involved in matters of interest to Customs.
FICKIE said he would keep Miami advised of any information
concerning matter of D'ALESSANDRO.

Ia view of above, Miami does not contemplate
interview of GARCIA at this time, and will maintain
contact with PIATKOWSKI in this matter.
