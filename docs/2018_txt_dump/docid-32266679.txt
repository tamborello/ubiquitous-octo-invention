1 | the effect that the committee agrees with the CIA to destroy
e@ 2 || documents and there will be sometime later on the last page
3 || of the Washington Post that we have explained to them that
@ 4 it is essentially trash that is being thrown away and not
5 | documents going to the heart of the investigation.
6 I really have brought it to your attention to get the
7 || advice of the committee on, I think, the political dimensions

8 | of the decision to suggest to the agency that they begin the

9 || routine document destruction. Obviously anything most re-

 

10 | motely related to this investigation should be preserved to !
11 | December 31.
12 Chairman Stokes. Are there any comments? Mr. Fithian.

e 13 fa Mr. Fithian. What kind of documents are they accumulating

 

14 || at one hundred cubic feet a day?

15 Mr. Blakey. Among other things, there would be receipts :
16 for exchange of documents between various buildings, just
VW simply receipts that the couriers have to pick up and take.
18 They have not even destroyed those receipts.

19 Mr. Fithian. You are only talking about documents

20 | pertaining to this investigation? ;

21 Mr. Blakey. No. All documents of the CIA are currently

22 not now being destroyed. No documents are being destroyed.

 

®@ 23 That is if a courier comes over here and delivers to us a |
copy of the background investigation that they have looked |

at we will give them a receipt and they will get a receipt

 

Docld:32266679 Page 9
1 ||from us. Those receipts go back to the agency. those

2 |jreceipts are not being destroyed. They have not been

3 |idestroying recipts now since the ban was originally placed
— 4 jon them. This goes back to the middle of the Church Committee |
5 || investigation.
6 It is a little more complicated than receipts. For

7 ||example, they pointed out to me that they have a number of —

 

8 | files now dealing with Operation CHAOS. I am sure you will
: ;
§ }all recall that the agency conducted investigations of
10 | domestic dissidents during the war. It is not lawful for |
11 |, them to retain those files. Private individuals have actually:
12 | written the CIA asking them that the file on them be destroyed|
13 ; because the agency has no right to retain it.
14 Under the moratorium requesting the agency not to des-
15 | troy any files during the course of this investigation the
16 | CHAOS Investigation Files, which are nothing even remotely
17 || related as far as I can see to our inquiry, are currently
18 | being retained by the agency.
19 Mr. Fithian. What kind of instruction can we give them
20 || to allow certain categories to be destroyed and yet not

21 open ourselves up to the fact that they may indeed destroy

 

 

22 || something that we need?
e 23 Mr. Blakey. They have a schedule where they identify
24 each document or each class of documents. If the committee

@ 25 | authorizes me, I can review those schedules along with the |

 

Docld: 32266679 Page 10

1 |iApril 13 pointing out that the document destruction program,

2} if resumed at this time, could have the appearance of an

3 || impropriety, although it is doubtful, in fact, that it would

“~
~

be in fact an obstruction of the investigation.

5 The CIA responded by asking me to come over and meet
6 | with them and I did one morning last week at about 7:30.
7 || They really pointed out the scope of the impact that this
8 | moratorium has had on them for this length of time. They

{
9 | tell me that the documents are increasing at the rate of

10 | approximately 100 boxes a day and this comes out to a cubic
11 foot a box, a hundred cubic feet a day; that if it were at
12 all possible, they would like to have some relief from this.
C 13 | _ They also pointed out that the normal process for docu- |
@ 14 ment destruction requires them to submit to the Archives
15 || schedules for destruction after which, should they be approv-|
16 ed by the Archivist, they should go the normal course. i
Vv The agency is currently not complying with the law in that
18 regard in order that they would be in a position of not de-
19 stroying records during the course of our investigation.

20 I am bring this to your attention because it seems to

 

21 me that we have a decent case to make that some of the

 

 

22 material that they have ought to be destroyed at this time,
e@ 23 that it has no remote relationship to our investigation.
Nevertheless, there is always a possibility that you will

@ 25 read on the front page of the Washington Post something to

 

Docld:32266679 Page 8
1 Mr. Blakey?
2 Mr. Blakey. Mr. Chairman, the next matter that I have |
3 to bring to the attention of the committee is one which you, |
4 of course, are familiar with and is somewhat of a housekeep=

5 ing nature. Nevertheless, I thought that it ought to be

6 | brought to the attention of the full committee.

7 In May of 1977 the CIA contacted Congressman (blank)
t
| i
8 and brought to his attention what was, in the agency’s'
t
9 terms, the moratorium document destruction. During the

. i
10 course of the Church Committee investigation, the Church i

11 || Committee asked the agencies, the FBI and the CIA, to cease

 

12 | destroying in a routine fashion any and all documents.
. . . ‘
e@ 13 | The CIA responded by refusing to destroy any further i
| i
14 documents, put a moratorium on their own document destroying |

15 process. The other investigation agencies agreed that they '
16 would not destroy any documents even remotely relating to
7 | the investigations pending before the Church Committee.
18 the Church Committee has since lifted that moratorium on
19 December 21, 1977..

20 The agency has contacted the committee and asked us

 

21 our opinion on the document destruction program. My recom-
22 mendation to the Chairman was that the committee respond by
keeping it in operation at least for the life of the committee,

; :

which would be through December of 1978.

In that vein, the Chairman wrote Admiral Turner on |

1 The witness would still have to appear and claim his privilege
@ 2 and the committee or subcommittee at that time sitting would |

3 || have to make a decision whether to communicate the order to |
e 4 || the individual. !
5 I think most of these witnesses, some of them, I will

6 | have to ask help for. Basically they are those people who

7 | are involved in the investigation somewhere and who could

 

8 | have, on any fair analysis of it, a possible claim of privi-

9 || lege. They are either the organized crime-type connected i
10 || or people who from the nature of the kind of questioning

1] | that we would ask them.could legitimately claim the privi-
12 lege.

13 As in the past, this is contingency planning. We do i
14 not necessarily know that all of these péople will claim the |
15 || privilege.

16 Chairman Stokes. Are there any questions relative to.

17 | this immunitity order? If there are no questions, the Chair

18 | will entertain a motion.

Chairman Stokes. Eight members of the committee having |

voted in the affirmative, this meeting is now in Executive
Session and all members of the public are asked to remove

themselves from the room. Mr. Blakey.

Mr. Blakey, Mr. Chairman, the first matter on the agen-

da should be the immunities. I had not thought it would be
necessary to bring the immunity matter before the committee
in light of the fact that we had done so at our last Monday

meeting. As it turned out, two witnesses on the

‘Kennedy side whom we had scheduled for deposiitons and

¢
thought were cooperative told the staff that they would

refuse to cooperate and would claim self-incrimination.

i
{
i
i

 

Consequently we had to face the possibility of subpoena-.

ing them before the committee. That gave rise to the
need for immunities. As long as the full committee was
going to be asked to do it again, I ask that the entire
schedule of witnesses that we could reasonably foresee
through both May and June, on both sides, be prepared to be
immunized at this time. It is a little in advance of when
we might absolutely need it in some cases, but it seemed to
te appropriate to get that all over with.

You have before you, therefore, a resolution that would
authorize the Committee Staff to go before the District

Court to get the order. Again I would point out for you

that this, of course, does not grant anyone immunity.
