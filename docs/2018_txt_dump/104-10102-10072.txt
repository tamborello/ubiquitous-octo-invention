OLTMANS spoke before the Women's Club in Sewickly, Penn-
sylvania, in a speech entitled "Let's Stop Losing Friends Abroad".
His services in making this speech were obtained through a New York
booking agent, Colston Leigh. He made, according to this source,
many stining remarks regarding the United States and expressed opi-
nions of a definite anti-Netherlands nature. He referred to the

Netherlands Government as stupid and stated The Netherlands should

have given New Guinea to Indonesia. He mentioned that the Netherlands|

Government considers him a traitor. It was observed by this source
that OLTMANS is accepted in th e well-to-do circles and that listen-
ers are impressed by him. Source commented that although OLTMANS

calls himself anti-communist, his views are at best those of a great

_ admirer of communism and what the communist System represents. Many

of their marriage, ten minutes after the ceremony, he had left her

At one time her father had determined that OLTMANS had a
police record for molesting young boys in Amsterdam, Holland, and
that he had been under psychiatric care with his uncle, a well-known
Dutch psychiatrist, for homosexuality. Subsequently, by chance, she
read a diary which he maintained, which gave a detailed account of
his daily life, in addition to his homosexual activities; she stated
that this convinced her that she must obtain a divorce.

‘Inasmuch as OLTMANS had not been very successful in his

invitation to a reception for SUKARNO at the Indonesian Embassy. He
then contacted: the representative of a leading French newspaper and
offered to do a story on SUKARNO for that newspaper. This offer
was accepted, and OLTMANS subsequently attended the reception for

SUKARNO, where he presented SUKARNO with a silver ash tray. Appar-

’ ently through this meeting and subsequent meetings SUKARNO permitted

him to travel with the press entourage from Indonesia which was tra-
veling. with SUKARNO. He later became the only Western newspaperman
who traveled: with the SUKARNO party as it made its way around Europe’,
on state visits and this travel included a visit to Yugoslavia. He
was unable to gotto the USSR as he was unable to obtain a visa and “
to get a seat on the airplane. Frieda BIELING stated that despite the
cordiality of Indonesian newspapermen toward OLTMANS there was a

certain amount of jealousy exhibited by these newsmen because of

' OLTMANS' close personal contact with SUKARNO.

OLTMANS subsequently returned to Holland where he started
to contact various Dutch industrial corporations whose holdings in
Indonesia had been seized or were in jeopardy of being seized by the
Indonesian Government. He was able to convince some of these indus-
trialists, particularly a Mr. REINKENS, the President of Unilever,
that because of his close relationship with SUKARNO he would be able
to arbitrate between the industrial empires and the Indonesian
Government for adequate compensation for their properties. In addi-

tion, he had also made arrangements with the Amsterdam newspaper

committed acts of lewdness with-his (complainant's) under-age
son during the summer of 1954. Inquiries into the matter failed
to reveal any evidence of any offense having been committed.

When interrogated, and also when being confronted with
each other, both the persons concerned denied any act of lewdness
having taken place between them. There was, however, evidence that
OLTMANS' ‘conduct toward the boy had been somewhat strange, which
caused | the latter to discontinue his association with OLTMANS.

‘As there was no evidence of any homosexual relations
having existed between the persons concerned, the Chief Commissio-
ner of Police, Amsterdam, was of the opinion that the matter should
not incriminate OLTMANS and should not be used in deportation pro-
‘ceedings against hin.

As correspondent for De Nieuwsgier, OLTMANS covered the
visit: to Indonesia of the Soviet Chief of State, VOROSHILOV. At
' several mass meetings the Russian President severly censored The
7 ae Netherlands, he pleaded for the immediate transfer of New Guinea “
to Indonesia, and posing as the great supporter of the young state,
he in this way assured the Communist Party of a resounding election
victory not long after. As a result the relations betwéem Indonesia
and The Netherlands deteriorated considerably.

[Haagse Post, 15 April 1961.]

Early 1956 :

OLTMANS learned that SUKARNO planned to pay a visit to
Italy and he asked his papers whether they would be interested in
an exclusive interview. The response was negative. At the seme.
‘time, however, OLTMANS contacted the Agence France Presse which en-
gaged OLTMANS, at a daily fee of some 30 guilders, to cover SUKARNO's
visit to Rome. The then 32-years old OLTMANS, contacted SUKARNO dur-
ing a reception at the Indonesian Embassy, and he managed to inter-
view SUKARNO. This interview made a great hit with the AFP which
asked OLTMANS to cover SUKARNO's trip through Italy.

In those days, OLTMANS got the firm conviction that he had

SECS

to fulfill a mission: a new formulated meeting of the interests of
The Netherlands and Indonesia. He wanted to go to Djakarta to make
a thorough study of the problems and after paying a number of visits
he secured financial aid (10,000 guilders) of some six Netherlands
enterprises with interests in Indonesia. Moreover, he entered into
arrangements with some papers, for which he could write articles as
their foreign correspondent.

In Djakarta, he soon met numerous Dutchmen, including
Professor P. N. DROST (who after having served in 1950 for one year
with the United Nations Human Rights Division, discontinued his ser-
vice because of unsatisfactory cooperation). During a visit which
he paid to DROST, OLTMANS discussed with him the position of the
Dutch in Indonesia, their dissatisfaction with the policy pursued
in The Hague, their desire to emerge from the Indonesian-Netherlands
impasse avidin this connection also the New Guinea issue. He made
the suggestion of expressing all these desires in an address to the
States General; Professor DROST himself was enthusiastic over it,
and that very evening, he drafted an address which was stenciled
with the. cooperation of a Dutch enterprise in Djakarta, and within
some days was signed by 300 Dutch nationals.

The address, which invited Parliament to set talks with

. Indonesia going again and to assume a more accommodating attitude

towards SUKARNO because otherwise sharp measures were to be expec-
ted against Dutch nationals and interests in Indonesia, was used by
the Indonesian representative to the United Nations to weaken the
official arguments: In The Netherlands press a storm was raised
against the signatories to the address and especially against the
journalist OLTMANS who was cited by DROST as the initiator. The
papers for which he acted as foreign correspondent terminated the
contracts.

[Haagse Post, 15 April 1961. ]

1956 : i

OLTMANS claimed during an open session before the Senate
Subcommittee, on 30 November 1962, that he interviewed SUKARNO in
Role, although the editor of De Telegraaf, the leading Dutch news-
paper, forbade OLTMANS to interview President SUKARNO.
