1. Enclosed yru will find a list of attendees (Enclesure A)
to the Pageash Conference held in ixmich, Gercany, in Aucust, and
a set of questions (Enclosure B) prepared by the ORPA analysts
at our request. Since the original list of attendees contained
only the last name and first jnitial of each US particip=.t, we
had to make some educated guesses as to the true identities of

of then. As a result, do not be surprised if some eeestion
why we felt they had attended. In many cases, however, tasre was
fon as to the true identity of the source.
