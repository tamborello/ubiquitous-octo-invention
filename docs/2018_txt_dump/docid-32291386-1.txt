been there during that period. These records indicate that
SID KORSHAK occupied Units 63, 64 and 65 from 12/26/60
through 1/1/61. KORSHAK again occupied Units 63, 64 and
65 from 1/11 through 15/61. Records indicate that MARIANNE
ee a guest of KORSHAK, occupying Unit 63 on 1/11 through

‘PCI SHERMAN HULL, Manager of CHARLES FARRELL's
Racquet Club}, was contacted on 1/31/61. He advised that he
is well acquainted with SID KORSHAK and knows him to be a
very successful attorney from Chicago, Illinois, and of late,
Los Angeles, California, and that KORSHAK has had considerable
to do with union activities in Chicago. He said KORSHAK
is a member of the Racquet Club and that he frequently stays
at the club occupying two or three units. He specifically
recalled that during the period 12/26/60 through 1/1/61,
KORSHAK, his wife BERNICE and their children occupied units
63, 64 and 65. :

Regarding the period 1/11 through 15/61, HULL
recalled that Mr. and Mrs. KORSHAK and children occupied
Units 64 and 65 while MARIANNE RYAN occupied Unit 63.

any guest atthe Racquet Club using the name GUS ALEX or
MICHAEL RYAN and was unable to identify a photograph of

PCI HULL described MARIANNE RYAN as being a relative
of KORSHAK's wife, possibly her sister, as he knew they had
been closely associated in modeling in Chicago. PCI HULL
also advised that Units 63,54 and 55 had been occupied from
1/2 through 4/61 by JACK ENTRATTER, who is well known to

the Salt Lake City and Los Angeles Offices as having an
