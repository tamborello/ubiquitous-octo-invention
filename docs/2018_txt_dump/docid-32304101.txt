SL. 7-429
- BKMemjh : .

On September 20, 1956, MARTIN SILK, confidential
‘source whose identity must be protected, personally advised
ASAC H, K. MOSS as follows:

He, SILK, had been by the residence of suspect
SHOULDERS at noon and early afternoon of September 20, 1958;
that the conversation at the SHOULDERS residence rotated entirely
around the interview with SHOULDERS by ASAC H. K. MOSS on the
preceding day.. SHOULDERS commented as follows. The FBI was
trying to involve. him in a criminal violation with respect to
4 wisit made by CLUBB to SHOULDERS’ residence, but: SHOULDERS
expressed confidence that the facts would not amount to a
violation. He speculated that if the FBI had a real good case
even against his son, young LOU, the PBI would have proceeded
Ammediately by Commissioner's complaint and warrant rather than
via indictments; that the latter method is used only when the
case is essentially a weak one, He further commented that he |
doubted if any action would be taken against himself for the
reason that news stories referred only to young LOU, and ;
certainly in view of all the press interest in SHOULDERS, himself,
had there been any possibility of proceeding against SHOULDERS
the newspapers would so have been advised. He referred to :
comments made by ASAC MOSS as to what would make SHOULDERS "taik",
and SHOULDERS claimed that. he implied that he had turned down a
$100,000 offer and when ASAC MOSS asked SHOULDERS to be a
Government witness against COSTELLO, SHOULDERS claimed to have
replied, "Hew can I when I.don't know anything?", It should be
noted this is contrary to the comment that SHOULDERS did actually
made to ASAC MOSS as related in the details of that interview

 
 

Yo: of ROBERT BERNARDKBAKER
was his opinion that in some manner or other the Teamsters
‘Union was utilized as a vehicle to dispose of the missing
GREENLEASE money. Referring to the efforts of the FBI to indict
him on the CLUBB matter, SHOULDERS said that at one time young
‘LOU SHOULDERS wanted SHOULDERS to "shelter" CLUBB but "I warned -
LOUIE that someday they'd. get that S.0.B.. in a crack and he'd
talk", SILK was of the opinion that notwithstanding SHOULDERS‘
claim that he was not worried about these developments, that
actually SHOULDERS was perturbed. :
