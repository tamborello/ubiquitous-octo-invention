1. Definitions
(a) Strategic Delivery Vehicles (SDV

The problem in defining an SDV is one of determining the
importance of the distance between the delivery vehicle and the target.
In an exchange between forces located in the US and forces located in
the USSR a strategic missile is simply defined as ‘one capable of making
the trip. While range is still the important factor in defining strategic
aireraft it is not a.complete description due to the increasing capability
of fighter aircraft. Strategic aircraft are more precisely described
in terms of weight.

The definition problem becomes acute as the distance between
nations is reduced. In Europe, for example, tactical missiles which
reach more than 60 kms beyond the immediate line of battle can frequently
perform a strategic role. Tactical aircraft (certainly US tactical
aircraft) are readily adaptable to the strategic role in Europe.

Granting that the definition:,. is arbitrary, we have defined
strategic aircraft in this paper by a weight (20,000 kilograms) sO as
to include all current US and USSR medium and heavy bombers. Likewise,
strategic missiles have been defined by range [X00 kilometers for sea-
based missiles and 1000 kilometers for land-based missiles] so as to
include all current Soviet missiles capable of striking US forces in

West Germany from Soviet soil.
