noticed P.O. Vaughn, who was stationed at this ramp, taking
one or two steps off the sidewalk and into the street to safely
direct him out into the traffic. Pierce, who was with two other
members of the force did notice several persons standing at the
entrance of the ramp, but did not know if they were waiting
there or just walking by and waiting for ‘his car to pass them
so that they could continue to walk. Pierce stated he knew Ruby
and. Napoleon Daniels, but did not see them. ‘In fact, Pierce
remarked that he was not aware of who was standing at the
entrance because his concentration was to. maneuver his vehicle
in front of the armored truck. Pierce does recall Vaughn being
in the gutter and he was either motioning his hands or blowing
his whistle to stop the traffic in order for him to get out of
the ramp. After leaving the ramp, he drove to Harwood Street and
made a left to Commerce Street where he made another left turn.
Pierce then said that as he arrived at Commerce Street ramp, he-
does not recall whether he parked the vehicle at the curb or backed
it into the Commerce Street ramp, but at about this time, they
were aware that something had happened inside the basement. They
immediately ran into the basement and learned what had happened.
After LHO had been. taken to Parkland Hospital, Pierce decided
also to go there as a precaution for security reasons. He was
not ordered to go there, but took the action as a supervisor.
He does not recall entering the hospital.

Pierce admits knowing Ruby from the late forties or

early fifties as the Silver Spur was on his post. He described
