MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Bdward G. Tichborn (P) - Contacts in Los Angeles

1. In the course of his debriefing on 1 February, Tichdorn _

said that he expected he would be called upon to address some public a

groups on his impressions on his recent stay in Havana. He went on
further to state that if he did not do so, he felt it would appear

strange to his colleagues in Les Angeles.

2. Additionally, Tichborn seid that the Director of Tourian
4n Cuba had told Min that American nowspapermen, TY casters, ete..
were weleame and that if enyone chose to come to Cuba on such a
mission he would be received with open arms and the Cuban Government
would defray his expensés. Ye spoke at this time of Mr. Clete Roberts
and asked if it would be alright for him to speek with Mr. Roberts vho
was a good friend of his and pass on the suggestion. On both of the
above counts, Tichbora said that he felt it would enhance his position
should he be called upon to return to Cuba.

3+. I agreed with Tickborn that he should speak if ‘called upen
and that he could pass on the Director's of Tourism remarks to his ~
friend Mr. Roberts. On 3 February I checked the above out vith
Mr. Ooerst, WH/C/PP, who concurred in my decision. On 3 February
T also reconfirmed the above to Tichborn.
