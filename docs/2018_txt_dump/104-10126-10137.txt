1. We would like to take time out in ovr investigation of the President's
assassination to appraise the role of the Mexico City Station in the whole affair.
Since the early afternoon of 22 November 1963, Mexico City has been the only
major overseas reporter in the case. While this is partly dictated by the
facts of Lee OSWALD's life, we have not overlooked the ze lly outstanding per-
formance of Mexico City's major assets and the sp  gpeeision, and perception
with which the data was forwarded. _ Here it wa

2. Your LIENYOY data, the statenents.of>Silvia DURAN, and your analyses

ominous spectre of foreign backing.

. 3Be We regret that we ha ‘bee able to send you so little information in
return, but we have not been ey much yet. We do know that Lee OSWALD denied
he had ever been to Mexic cof for a jump to Tia Juana. We have quickly
screened the FBI reports ‘te whole case but we do not yet have a copy for -
retention. It does n by dgperonise your sources. Basically, what the New York
imes has printed aboutitile report is all true.

3. We have meanwhile been flooded with fabrications » OF which the ALVARADO

story was the most troublesome, They are still coming in. ;

-h. You have had good support from your liaison, but as usual the really
outstanding features were Mexico Station's famous generalship and the skill and
devotion of its personnel. Please convey our admiration to all who participated,

_ down to the last technician, translator, and monitor. We know that the work
your Station did during the President's 1962 visit made you feel this tragedy

_with particular keenness, as did we.
