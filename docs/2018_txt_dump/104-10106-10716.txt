Edouard POLDINI, & geophysicist and profescor at the University of .
Geneva and formerly an employee of the SCHLUMBERGER CORPORATION in
Paris, for operational use. He was to be used as = channel to a Janus

- KARTAS who could give information ebout the fate of the previous employees of

the Jersey Company in Hungery, the production figures end extent of
exploitation of existing o11 fields and exploration of new oll fields
with the nemes of the officials of the Ruseiean Himgerien Company

In March 1953 the SCHLUMBERGER file reflects that an FAI source
furnished information that one Maurice Henri MARTIN, employed as an -
enginear by the SCHLUMBERGER Company, Paris, France, received a letter
éated 27 July 1951 at Moscow from one SiegPied Btefanovitch MOROSOFF,
asking MARTIN for specialized information concerning geophysics. The ;
letter requested that MARTIN'’s reply be forwarded to Moscow through an intere-

mediary. From January 1932 wntil April 1937 MARTIN represented the SCHLUMBERGER

Company in Russia as an engineer, and it was thought that the correspondence
from MOROSOFF may represent a Soviet attempt to resume contact with MARTIN
and Gevelop clandestine relations with him. fhe FBI conducted en investi«
gation dated Jime 1953 and determined that Maurice Henri MARTIN resided

at Nod Hill, Wilton, Connecticut and was employed by the SCHLUMBERGER

Well Surveying Co., Ridgefield, Connecticut. Informants advised that
although MARTIN was strongly nationalistic toward France, he pave every
4ndication of being anti-Russian and there was no evidence of CP activities.

done on the directors and officers of SCHLUMBERGER, LID. The results
ere as follows:

OS indices reflect a record on Dillon ANDERSON, a trustee of
Electru=Mechanical Research, Inc. (a subsidiary of SCHLUMBERGER, Lzp.)

SCHLUMBERGER. ANDERSON is an attorney from Houston, Texas who wes
appointed by President EISENHOWER es an advisor to the Netional Security
Council from 1953 util 1956. ° He was considered for a special clearance
in August 1955 but the briefing was not given. He was granted a covert Op
clearance in December 1953 and April 195li(for use as a covert essociate

Charles C. PARLIN, Director of SCHLUMBERGER, LTD., and a member
of the lew firm of SHEARMEN, STERLING end WRIGHT, Englewood, New
