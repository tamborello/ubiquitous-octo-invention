On Page 51 of the "New York Times" of May 25, 1963,

carried and mentioned that in June, 1961, ANTHONY CASTELLITO,

{ Secretary-Treasurer of Local 560, International Brotherhood

of Teamsters, had disappeared and is presumed dead. "Observers
i pelieved that his popularity had posed a threat to the
PROVENZANO leadership."

CASTILLANO (undoubtedly reference to CASTELLITO) was the

\ former President of Local 560, International Brotherhood of

: Teamsters, in New Jersey. KONIGSBERG was assisted in this
murder by a SALLY BORGIO (phonetic) (undoubtedly SALVATORE

: BRIGUGLIO) who became a business agent for Local 560 right
after the murder and as payment for his part in the murder.

‘ On June 22, 1965, HAROLD KONIGSBERG advised that, as
part of the deal for killing CASTELLITO, ANTHONY PROVENZANO
(TONY PRO) promised SAL BRIGUGLIO a pusiness agent Job.

| According to the "Local 560 Teamster," Volume 2,
Number 5, May, 1963, which is published by Local Union 562,
