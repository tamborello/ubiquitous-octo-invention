1. DUTKANIC2's Army assignment at time of defection,

USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2 (copy attached) confirms
DUTKANICZ's aseignument to the 32nd Signal Battalion in Darmetadt.
However, his wife indicated that he had CIC connections. In an interview
! at the American Embassy Moscow on §. December 1961 (cited in DBA-288,

24 January 1962), she indicated that their trip behind the Iron Curtain "had
been made possible because her husband worked for the CIC and was allowed
to do things the ordinary 'GI' could not do."' There are also penciled no-

i tations in the 201 file suggesting that his Army assigament may have included
intelligence functions of some kind.

2. Previous KGB ‘connection of both defectors. see

Per USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2, DUTKANICZ himself
told American Embassy officials in Moscow that he had been approached by
KGB representatives in a bar near Darmatadt in 1958 and had accepted
recruitment ag a result of their threate and inducements. He claimed to
have piven them minimum cecperation from then until his defection, although
the Army considered it probable that he had dene more than he admitted. A
further indication of his KGB involvement before defection is the fact that the
special decree granting him Soviet citizenship was enacted three months before
his arrival in the USSR; see Emb tel 851.
