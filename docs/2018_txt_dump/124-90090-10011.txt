ADMINIS TRATIVE

On June 30, 1959, and on July 31, 1959, PSI
VENANCIO LOPEZ SOSA, who is under developmeny’ by the

Miami Office, was questioned as to his testifying concerning
the information which he had furnished with regard to the
meeting he attended on June.1,..1959, at the home of

JUSTO LUIS POZO dél PUERTO. LOPEZ stated that he does \ {|
not desire to testify concerning the matter as he fears mth
for his life and the life of his family if he should do a
so. : ¢

|

It is noted that the development of LOPEZ
as a PSI has been discontinued due to reports that
he is furnishing information to the present Cuban
Government and because it was reported by others present
at the meeting on June 1, 1959, that LOPEZ failed to
furnish the identity of two other individuals who were
there who were known to him, because they were friends.
When, subsequently questioned as to whether there were
not more individuals present at the meeting, LOPEZ
stated that he could not recall the identities of any
of the others. It is also noted that ROBERT WILLIAMS ,
then under development as a PSI in the Miami Office also,
was present at the above meeting and furnished substantially
the same information as LOPEZ concerning the contents of
the meeting, however, WILLIAMS, who is known to LOPEZ,
also furnished LOPEZ’ name and the name of WILLIAM JOHNSON,
a former friend of LOPEZ, whom LOPEZ would not identify.

PSI ROBERT WILLIAMS inditated upon originally ;
being contacted concerning his possible development as {
a PSI that he had no objection to testifying to information
furnished by him should it become absolutely necessary.
However, development of WILLIAMS as a PSI has been —
discontinued due to instructions contained in Bureau
letter to Miami dated June 30, 1959, entitled, "ROBERT i
ARTHUR WILLIAMS; PSI - CUBA.'"' In this letter, it was
stated that due to the indication that WILLIAMS may be |
bordering on mental instability and in view-of the :
diagnosis‘ set forth in St. Louis letter dated June 11,

1959, no further effort should be made to develop WILLIAMS
as a PSI. ‘

. In view of the-above, it does not appear that ye
LOPEZ or WILLIAMS would be desirable witnesses. |

In view of the information set forth below, \
it ig believed that information concerning the activities if
of ROLANDO ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS and of JUSTO LUIS \:
POZO del PUERTO. can better be reported in the individual ut
case files which have been opened on each of them in the
Miami Office. : .

- In view of the fact that the proposed plan

for the attack on the Isle of Pines was discarded

on approximately June 13, 1959, according to information
furnished by WILLIAMS on:June 17, 1959, and confirmed on ;
June 21, 1959, by RICHARD JAFFE, an American pilot associated ey |
with ex-Cuban Senator ROLANDO ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS, I
and because no indication has. been received that any x
such plan of attack has been reconsidered or that airplanes *
mentioned in connection with the plan have been purchased 1
and becduse the Cuban Government has now reinforce the “
Isle of Pines garrison with veteran Cuban Revolutionary \
Army men known as "Barbudos"' and lastly because no
indication was ever received that PEDRO DIAZ supposedly
in charge of the demolition and sabotage activities in
the Isle of Pines had ever left the Isle of Pines.

CONFI TIAL

In view of the above,\it is believed more
economical and advisable to close instant case and to
continue reporting individual information concerning
MASFERRER and POZO and any other individuals whose
names are herein mentioned in individual case files
which are opened in the Miami Office.

Miami is not requesting permission to interview
MASFERRER at this time inasmuch as permission has been
requested to interview POZO and it is believed that it
would be advantageous to have in Miami's possession any
. information furnished by POZO prior to an interview with

MASFERRER. This is believed advisable in view of the
fact that MASFERRER has been interviewed on two previous,
occasions and has not furnished any information which
would indicate that he was engaged in ANTI-FIDEL CASTRO

ACTIVITY.

Results of said interviews,when conducted, will
be reported in individual case files.

On July 31, 1959, ELOISE ERICSON, Clerk in the
Miami Office, who has relatives.on the Isle of Pines in
Cuba, advised that she visited the Isle of Pines on
June 5, 1959, and at that time, noticed detachments
of Barbudos training and marching in the various areas
of the island.

She stated that she stayed with relatives near
the Nueva Gerona Airport on Isle of Pines and saw numerous
Barbudos at and around the airport.
