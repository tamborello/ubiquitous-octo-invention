Mr. Goldsmith, Mr. Hidalgo, on July 28, 1978, were you
interviewed by two staff employees of the Select Committee on
Assassinations? |

Mr. Hidalgo, It was in July of 1978, yes.

Mr, Goldsmith, Mrs Hardway who is sitting on my left and
Mr, Berk who is sitting on my right.

Mr, Hidalgo. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Subsequent to that interview did you have
any discussion with any employee of the CIA concerning what you
told Mr, Berk and Mr. Hardway? |

Mr, Hidalgo. Concerning what I told Mr. Berk and Mr,
Hardway, no, sir.

Mr, Goldsmith. So no one from the CIA, I take it, dis-
cussed the substance of your discussion with Mr. Berk and Mr,

Mr, Hidalgo. No, sir.

i

 

Mr. Goldsmith. Is that correct?

Mr. Hidalgo. May I say they are no longer the people I |
talked to because we are still friends and I see them occa-
sionally. They are not now with the CIA, i

Mr, Goldsmith, I understand.

I recognize it may be carrying coals to New Castle, that a

|
man who has spent many years as an officer in the Central
Intelligence Agency has a conditioned reluctance to disclose
methods notwithstanding the acknowledged entitlement of this
committee to receive such information if the committee deems
| the information pertinent but I raise this point only by way
| o£ appealing to the committee as we may from time to time, if
| considered necessary, to carefully weigh the pertinence or
{

relevance or indispensability of names of persons who may have

 

risked life or limb or liberty or careers in the service of

} the United States, If that information is deemed relevant,
there is no question that it will be provided if we are called
| but there may be cases where the committee feels that although
it would be entitled to the information it can do without it
and in such cases we would request that the committee forego

the identification of persons,

That includes the identity of the witness himself. It
would be tragic or could be tragic if the fact were disclosed

agencies and departments of the United States Government and
whether any evidence or information not in the possession of
an agency or department would have been of assistance in
investigating the assassination and why such information was
not provided or collected by that agency or department and to
make recommendations to the House if the committee deems it
appropriate for the amendment of existing legislation or the
enactment of new legislation.

“This is the mandate of the committee.

You may be seated, Mr. Hidalgo.

Would your counsel state his name.

Mr. Gaines. Stanley H. Gaines, 150 Little Falls Street,
Falls Church, Virginia.

Mrs. Burke, The staff will proceed to interrogate,

Mr. Goldsmith. Thank you.

Mrs, Burke, prior to the beginning of this hearing Mr.
Gaines asked me if he might make a brief statement and I
indicated to him I had no problem with that,

Mrs. Burke, Certainly.

Mr. Gaines. I would like to assure this distinguished

committee that Mr. Hidalgo has been apprised of the charter

of the committee, of the seriousness of the committee's charter
and the scope of it which is considerably broad and intends to
answer all relevant questions to the best of his recollection.

I would simply like to impress on the committee, although
