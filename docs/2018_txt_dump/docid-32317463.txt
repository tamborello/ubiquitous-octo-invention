He advised that MATTY GIORDANO, on an occasion within the
past couple of years when ROSSELLI was at La Scala Restaurant
stated that ROSSELLI was born in the same town, Avellino, as
were his, GIORDANO's parents and that ROSSELLI is not his
true name. GIORDANO mentioned ROSSELLI's true name to LEON

_ but LEON does not remember it.. He recalls that it was an

“ Italian name that had "rhythm," ~

 

Newark has been requested to conduct investigation
concerning GIORDANO and his family in Hoboken, New Jersey,
prior to contemplated interview of GIORDANO's father, if
alive, and of MATTY GIORDANO.
