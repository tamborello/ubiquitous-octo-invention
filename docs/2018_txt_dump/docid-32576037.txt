fi ReMIairtel 8/12/64.
SA KENNETH J. HASER determined on 8/18/64, that

a special search by name of records of FBI Identification
Division re JASPER GALLO produced negative results.

 

On 8/18/64, SA HASER determined through the Office
of Security, Department of State, that there is no record
of GALLO in the current visa files of State (1955 to date).
Noted that Visa Office has records on fewer than 1% of all U.S.|#
visas issued throughout world by reason of operation of 4
immigration laws which vest responsibility for issuance of /

 

such visas in U. S. Consular Offices:; abroad. In this
connection, if GALLO were issued U. S. non-immigrant

visa in Italy at Embassy or Consulate there, record main- fe
tained there for four years. If he were issued immigrant

visa at Embassy or one of Consulates, record will be
maintained there 16 months and then destroyed. ff other
investigation re GALLO's entry to U. 8S. negative, suggest

have Legat, Rome, check for post visa file.
