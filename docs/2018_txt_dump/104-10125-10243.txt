Subject: Background on Mexico Station Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Enbassies)

1. Unilateral coverage. From the time the Mexico Se ation was opened in

April 1947°(by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed @ support apparatus to Bay ,
exploit leads ‘from the Soviet Enbassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)
consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance
team and a mail intercept operation.
a. -Fhone taps were placed by! z an’ ‘employee of the telephone company
Totaneel we Mie lad,
(who vas} handled by yey WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines -
tapped was Linked by | by availability of a listening post nearby
(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/
Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, ete) transcribers. Generally
these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican Anerican) were related

(which the station at that time felt was good security in that

af they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b, Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help
“of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) end TDY TSD
people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment
devices, These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,
and LICALIA). LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across
the street from the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had
both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate'was on the
NorthVest corner.of their compound and LIMITED vas diagonally

when someone of interest left the/Eabassy gate and stay with then,

This: vorked fairly vel until about the niddle of 1958 (check date) . “s
when one of the surveillance agents got too close to his target and ,
