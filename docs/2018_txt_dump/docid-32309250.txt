The source reporting information regarding
CALIXTO GARCIA INIGUEZ is ARNESTO RODRIGUEZ.

New Orleans will through public records and through
confidential sources determine any pertinent material concerning
subject organization. No active open investigation will be
conducted as it appears that in the membership of subject
organization are included numerous prominent citizens of New
Orleans and their activities on the surface do not appear to be
such as would put the organization within the purview ef the
Registration Act or applicable sections of the Internal Security
Act.
