On 10/14/66, LA 4448-C-TE positively identified’
the photograph of JOHN ROSS PATRONO as being identical ‘with
the individual introduced to him several years ago at’
Hollywood Park Race Track as JOHN RUSSO or JOHN ROSSI, an
LCN "member" of the Texas "Brugad" by Los Angeles LCN "Capo"
ANGELO POLIZZI. Informant had not seen PATRONO since and

was not currently in a position to be familiar with PATRONO's

activities. LA 4448-C-TE is a "member" source of the Los
Angeles Office who furnishes on a continuing basis extensive
information concerning LCN and related matters.

The changed title does not include the names JOHN
RUSSO or JOHN ROSSI, as these names were the recollection of
an introduction of several years past, and they have not
appeared from other sources as names used by PATRONO,

Careful consideration has been given to each
source concealed and 'T symbols were utilized in this report
only in ‘those instances where the identities of the sources
must be concealed and where the sources have so requested
