to be SAMMGIANCANA discussed the¢Standard Garbage Disposal.
Company and“thé difficulties this company had been encountering
with the Garbage Disposal Association, Apparently the
association had been utilizing pressure in order to stop

the Standard Disposal Company from expanding their business.

It was MURRAY HUMPHREYS contention that an Antitrust suit
should be Tiled against the Disposal Association and go

through legitimate channels to exert pressure against the a
association rather than using muscling tactics. Th} at

Dun and Brad Street Inc., report dated 5/2/60,

reveals that the Standard Dis
Inc., formerly at 55 East 18t

posal and Metal Company,
h Street, Chicago, had moved

to 1216 South Sangamon.

BERNARD ‘L..}SAMPSON and WALTER-bQEBENBERG, secretary and al

just started and financial details were lacking. LOEBENBERG

active in that business./){ |
