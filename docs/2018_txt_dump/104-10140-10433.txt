however, are excised and the staff must show relevancy to the

- investigation if there is any question as to making material available.
For example, the Committee's inquiry into the CLA/

_CIA employee James Wilcott's allegation that Oswald was a CIA agent,

Those staffers given this special access have executed special secrecy
agreements which run to the Director as opposed to the Committee as is the
case with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for example.

There also has been concerns expressed that the Committee has been

given greater access than has ever been done before in a Congressional
investigation, Although we are getting into new unchartered waters

as a result of the Jay Epstein book, the Church Committee, for example,
had wide access to the Oswald 201 file and personnel files.

4, Attached is an agenda for the next Task Force meeting. You
may wish to review some of the major issues pending. Positions on
these issues, of course, will be fully coordinated and appropriately
presented to the DDCI/DCI for determination.
