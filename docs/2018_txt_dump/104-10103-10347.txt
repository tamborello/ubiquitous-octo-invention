~ 1. Castro's purge of Escalante surfaced his

elements of the 26th of July Movement and the
‘une ligned" government leader and the PSP - "old"
and "new",

, and of questionable value: .
a. The PSP to gain its final objective would
take any insult and turn the other cheek.
° “It had embraced Fidel and would not let go
. under any circumstances. To rise against
Castro now would not be opportune, and
would probably be fatal.
b. Fidel was now totally dependent on the
Soviet Union
c. The only hope was not to split Fidel from
PSP but to identify, at every opportunity,

him and his government with communisn, for

I The Direction of Task Force Efforts to Split the Regime:

(AS

To identify those members of the 26th of July Movement

and other "unaligned" government leaders who were for

: the revolution but against communism. To date, there

is ‘reasonably ‘good evidence indicating that the
following individuals do not approve of the communist
direction of the Cuban revolution and may in fact

be conspiring against the regime.

“1. Major Pedro: Miret Prieto, ‘commanding artillery unit

2. Ambassador Gustavo Arcos y. Bergnes
