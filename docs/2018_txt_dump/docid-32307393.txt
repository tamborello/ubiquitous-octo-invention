Re Jacksonville letter to Miami, and Tampa
airtel to Miami, dated 4/7/65. :

 

CAREY MATTHEWS is a Fla. state representative
and Miami attorney with offices in the Ainsley Building,
Miami, Florida. He presently represents ANTHONY RUSSO
(MM file 92-729), and recently represented VINCENT JAMES
PAIMISANO, aka (MM file 92-503).

Mr. MATTHEWS is presently cooperating with the
Miami Office regarding criminal intelligence matters, but
his reliability has not been established adequately enough
to discuss matters mentioned in Newark airtel to the
Bureau, 4/65.

Mr. MATTHEWS was recently appointed head of a
crime commission, the purpose of which is to subject
legislation for the State of Fla. to cope with gambling
violations within the state.
