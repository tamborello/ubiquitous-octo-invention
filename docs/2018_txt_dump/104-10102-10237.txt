COVER AND COMM ICATIONS

 

1. Cover |

A/2 will be issued documentation claiming he is an employee

of a local brewery in Havana. A/3 on the other hand will be
issued documentation as a bus driver within the city of Havana.
Both will also be isstied drivers licenses and additional

items such 4S immunization certificates, Cuban reGéipts, ete.
The two men will also be outfitted with disftises.

“2, Communications

Primary communicatiéns will be eStablished through an SW
system, Both tien will be given SW instruc¢tion and will be
issued acéémmodation addresses in Miami, This instruction

atid these addressés in turn will be passed on to the reernhited
assets in PBRUMEN for usé as the operation develops. Pre-
arranged signals will also be dévised for usé by the team via
télegram.to indicate their progress and confirm their place
and timé of exfiltration. Both mémbérs will also be given an
OWVL system to provide them with quick instructions in casé

of an emergency.

OPERATIONAL AND SECURITY _ EVALUATION

   

1. The operational aspects of Phase I portrays a mission which
has considerable potential but also considerable risk. The
area of infiltration is within five miles of a cruisé missile
site and its accompanying radar. .In addition boat patrels are
kaAown to work this portion of ‘the coast at frequent intervals.

“Once infiltrated the team will not have to travel far before

their first contact. However, A/3 is leary of staying at his
for any length of time arid hé does not want his
to know of his présence in Cuba. For this reason the

 

“farm will not be able to serve as a safehouse, A/2Z plans on

_lands, This presents the

leaving the farm the same da,
.On approach is to také A/3

  

 
at,

 

to Guanabo or Havana and safehouse him. This, howéver, may
jeopardize the operation becausé A/3 lacks the maturity and
patience nécessary to stay put while A/2 goes about his busi-
ness. Hé may take advantage of his visit to Havana to under=
take a clandéStiné assignment on his own. When A/2 and 3
step ashore in Cuba; Control will vanish. Fortunately 4/2

haS a sufficient Yesource of judgement to go about his busi=

ness competently. Unfortunately A/3 gives no such indication.
For this reason an attempt will be made to Steer A/3 towards
developing assets around ‘his [ with maritime
recéption capabilities.

 

 

 

 

2. A/2, on the other hand, appears to have a sufficient numbe
of Supporting assets to provide for his safety while in Havana

However; hé has not seen andl ai over a year, In
addition both ten are presently outside of the Cuban Army

organization and this poSition may dampen their effectivenéss

in recruiting within the Army. Station reports on ]con-

‘flict with A/2's évaluation of this man. While there is no

evidencé to verify that l___lis pro=regime, there has been
a recent report 6n him from AMLEO/3 which claims is an

opportunist Who might work for the highest bidder. A72's
rebuttal to these remarks is that. Canal BS assisted him in

' the past arid when the chips were down he continued to aid him

in his underground activities, This still leaves a qtiestion
mark next to the worth of which unfortunately can only
be resolved by direct contact between him and A/2. There are
other security implications which should be diScussed in this
evaluation, Both A/2 and A/3 cannot bé considered truly se-
Glirity corsciouS, While safehotised A/2 wroté a letter to a
contact in Miami which Was to be transmitted by his case
officer. The letter gave an indication that A/2 was séeking
contactS in Havana arid conveyed the impréssion that a trip
was in the afing. _A/2 has written several other letters

sion. _ Ags. ‘on the other hand
r iK/2 on an opération that would take them
first to. Miami and then to Cuba. Once there they would go
to his and begifi to make contacts. A/3 also
stated at a man named ould bé one of their con=
tacts. This loosé talk Goupléd with A/3's attitude that
KUBARK 6xists only to servé him makes him 4 marginal candi=
daté for this operation. However, if A/3 is exfiltrated

tacts. An undercurrent of friction has recently developed between
AMICE/14 and AMTRUNK/3 which manifested itself in a fistfight on

' 29 March. This was precipitated by AMTRUNK/3 who called AMICE/14

the Cuban term for a homosexual, the ultimate insult to a Cuban.
This in turn gives rise to the question whether AMICE/14, with a

_ Possible history of homosexual activity (see UFGA-8411), has made

‘such an approach. to AMTRUNK/3.

D. The commitments made to AMICE/27 or which AMICE/27 claims were

. ————————

I. STATUS REPORT ON. TRAINING AND PROCESSING, 4-31 MARCH,

tines adametinn c TS

. The AMTRUNK Team, consisting of AMICE/27, AMICE/14, ANTRUNK/2,
‘and AMTRUNK/3 were safehoused on 4 March 1963 at Safesite #164

on Plantation Key. Andrew S, PARMERS, KUROAR instructor from
headquarters, was already at the training site when the team
was brought there by the two case officers, Irving N. PEGGINS
and Hobart J. VANDEBORN. PARMERS remained at the safesite
until 16 March during which time he conducted training in
Clandestine methods and techniques, This training included
security, cover and compartmentation, clandestine communica-
tions, agent spotting, selection, recruitment and management,
and operational planning and reporting. The training included
group discussion and participation in a series of ‘appropriate
operational situations, several problems, and daily physical
training. During this two week period, either PEGGINS or
VANDEBORN visited the safesite every day, spending an average
of two or three hours with the group in operational dis- _
cussions and processing. During the week of 18 thru 23 March,

‘both case officers spent a majority of the time with the group,
‘debriefing them in detail on their operational contacts, workin

out operational details of their infiltration, and continuing
their training on an informal basis. The week of 25 through
30 March was spent in PM-type training with emphasis on compass

-and map reading, including two night problems, and on weapons

familiarization and firing. During the period under dis-
cussion the AMTRUNK group were all LCFLUTTERED, were assessed
by the KUROAR assessment team, were given an initial series

' of immunizations, were issued clothing, were processed for
_ alias documentation, were processed for disguises, and were

further processed on cover and finance problems. The ré-
sults of the LCFLUTTER examinations were sent to headquarters
under cover of UFGA-8111, on 13 March 1963. Based on DIR :
26430, no further LCFLUTTER is planned at the present time,
Transmitted as attachment "A" to this dispatch is PARMERS
report on his training of the AMTRUNK group, transmitted as
attachment "B" are the results of the assessments of the

_ AMTRUNK group, and transmitted as attachment "C" is the

training report for the week of 25 March.
