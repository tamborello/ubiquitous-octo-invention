Re Milwaukee airtel 5/18/62.

In referenced airtel Milwdukee set forth the results
of check of the telephone company for the telephone of PCI
Frank Russell. One of the contacts dccording to these records |
‘was a Washington, D. C., telephone number RE 7=9775 on 4/2/62.

“ In handling the leads set forth in referenced airtel
Washington Field should insure a check is made with respect to
the identity of the person at the above listed telephone number
in Washington. Thereafter, if detertined advisable, appropriate
investigation should be conducted.

 

lL = Milwaukee (92-247)

1 - New Orleans (92+36) ;

\ NOTE: Russell, a PCI of the Milwaukee Office, has furnished information

| concerning the Marcello case and claims to be in contact with Jim
‘Donohue, a Washington lobbyist. Russell claims Donohue has approached
him to make contacts with high Government officials in an effort to
assist Marcello in litigations. The information furnished by Russell
is highly questionable and ‘sas a result, Milwaukee, New Orleans and .
Washington Field are attempting to verify Russell's story by conducting
discreet inquiries and checks concerning Russell's+past contacts.
In referenced airtel Milwaukee set forth the results of telephonic
contacts by Russell in Washingon, D. C., including the telephone number
listed above, but did not set forth a lead for Washington Field to

Bina eheck further in this matter.
