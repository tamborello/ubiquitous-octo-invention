conversation he is most insistent that POTENZO not be seen

in the motel, and the import of his instructions was passed
on by CG 6621-PC, who advised that he had been told by
GIANCANA recently that POTENZO is not to be seen at the motel.
This informant states that neither POTENZO nor any of his
associates have been seen there since that edict.

The next topic of conversation concerns itself with
POTENZO's prospective plans for gambling enterprises. It is
noted that from the latter part of December, 1962, through early
February, 1963, the location of Cook County's largest gambling
operation. was at the intersection of River and Higgins Road,
Rosemont, in the basement of a liquor store located one block
north of the Village Hall. Apparently the new location is
located now in the Rosemont Industrial District in a small
plastics factory operated by POTENZO as a front. Physical
observation of this site bears out POTENZO's claim that it is
impossible to. get in unless driven there. It is also next
to impossible to. conduct a decent surveillance prior to a
contemplated gambling raid.’ This is a temporary location to be
utilized until POTENZO can satisfactorily locate elsewhere,
POTENZO: That SARNO, he come up to me and says, what
the hell, I can't make no money here with you guys
hanging around........they went up to the Wagon
Wheel and put their own locks on the place. ‘
covccocoeseee they went through the whole joint,
and when they left, they put their own locks
on........,saturday night we had to bust
the place in. to get in. In the big room.......
they were over on Milwaukee Avenue, and........
«+..Somebody over there gave the G guy.....the
G told them this. The G told them that our
joint (R&H) was gonna get raided, but what the
hell. I was closed already...........(no
comment by GIANCANA)......listen, there's a
joint on Milwaukee Avenue, the Lone Tree Inn,
They're booking in there, and the Mayor of Niles
is hanging in there. Lone Tree Inn. They play i
cards in there, too. BUTCH MEYERS has got the :

stop.

Remember that bootlegger, BUTCH MEYERS?

You know the guy, grey haired guy.

You want me to

grab the guy, or you want the joint to get nailed?
I'll nail the Mayor‘and all them guys. You know,
Milwaukee and Harlem? About two blocks north of
there, They're booking there. (can't decipher

You know the heat is there, why are you hangin’
out in there? (shouting)

You know why? That BILL MC GUIRE is in there.
He hangs in there every night. Who put him in |
there?

THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. —

Well, if you're gonna beef about one guy, peef

about the other guy too. He was there every night.
He had two tables there. (at Caravelle Motel)

He won't listen to what you tell him, he runs
around there like a chicken without a head.

MOE, I got another SPOt.ccccscccscccsccessejust like,
last week, when they came into the joint.....++...we
all ran down into the basement. This guy was

there, that guy was there. ~

I DON'T WANT THAT JOINT TO BE A HANGOUT.

MOONEY, THERE WON'T BE A HANGOUT THERE. I, don't
give a (obs). There won't be no hangout there.

The G is in’and out of there all the time.

That night, just before you came in, these

guys are sitting at tables, talking, yelling
bla, bla, bla, They hurt you, if the G can hear
them. Then when you walk in, they shut up, ~

' and everybody is like a lamb. They don't respect

nobody, except you. If these guys come in, you
can't chase them out.

I don'twant these guys hanging around there.

That one night you was there, I was there to see
FRANK, JI ate, and I left. The next night you
came, I was working in the. kitchen, they had a
leak in there, I usually stay by the liquor
store, .

All day long, the G spots you guys going in there.

Well, one night, it was FRANK SARNO's birthday.
There was women there and everything. I told
the Mayor (poNALD E. STEPHENS, CG 6621-PC), I
