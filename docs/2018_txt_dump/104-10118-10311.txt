contribution to the Clandestine Service.

By virtue of unusual dedication to duty which over a
Period of several years, included consistently long hours,
superior performance and tangible achievement in sensitive
Matters of national security, Miss Goodpasture has excelled
aS an operations officer. She was the case officer who was
responsible for the identification of Lee Harvey Oswald
in his dealings with the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. She was
also responsible for other important and successful opera-
tions against Soviet penetration efforts directed toward
the United States from Mexico. She would rather work than
rest, and when she works, she always impresses her super-
iors with her Mastery over her craft. For thirty years
Miss Goodpasture has given unstintingly of herself to
the cause and mission of this Agency; the Agency owes her
formal acknowledgement of appreciation.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL ;

 

* Although ‘this employee is a fine int elligence officer end bas workea

very hard for the Chief of Station, Mexico City, I consider the reting

of Outstanding in all specific duties and for over~all performence to be
excessively high. Reporting on the activities she supervises has been

as good as that from other Mexico City operations but is still not up

to DDP standerds. While most of the projects she is concerned with are
‘hendled with proper cost consciousness, at least one of them, the LITEMPO
Project,is not. The agents are paid too much and their activities are
not adequately reported. This has been called to the station's ettention.

Miss Goodpasture has been on sick leave since July 1972 awaiting

medical retirement in October 1973. She ts a charter member of the Agenc

i having entered on duty from OSS and its successor organizations. Her
career is highly distinguished by virtue of consistently strong to out-
standing performance, all of which is fully documented.

In addition to several staff and desk assignments, Miss Goodpasture
served in support of the successful coup against th ist government
‘in Guatemala in 1954 and completed tours of duty iq tenterrey and
Mexico City. Undoubtedly, the high point of her ca rred during
her service in Mexico City from 1957 through 1970, where she served as a
"trouble-shooting" case officer for the incomparable Winfield Scott
(deceased), who was then the Chief of Station. Mr. Scott, a stern task-

master, described Miss Goodpasture over these years as “intelligent, hard
working, conscientious, versatile, valuable and unquestionably one. of the
most competent Ci/CE officers he ever had the privilege of working with."
‘Miss Goodpasture's fitness reports were totally consistent with this
appraisal, and were characterized by outstanding ratings. . In her final
assignment prior to acute medical problems, she worked for the CI Staff
(October 1970-October 1971), earning the following remarks from her
supervisor: -"...1 venture to rate her overall performance, thirty years
of it, as Outstanding. Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which

this organization is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this organi
zation will be weakened." The reviewing official agreed with the above
‘and recorded his hope that Miss Goodpasture get the official Agency recog
tion she so richly deserves for the many years she s made substantive
