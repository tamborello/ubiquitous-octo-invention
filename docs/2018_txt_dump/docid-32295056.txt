MARTIN CLEARY

No identification of this individual is in the
witness list except an address "Binghamton, New York." It
is probable he is identical to MARTIN CLEARY, bellhop at
the Arlington Hotel, Binghamton, New York, since 1943.
CLEARY is currently a PCI of the Albany Division. His file
was opened 10/15/59, and we have been in contact with him as
a PCL, initial contact 10/12/59. He has not previously been
interviewed in respect to the matters concerned in U. S. vs
BONANNO or re the Apalachin meeting hoodlums. No information
has yet been obtained from CLEARY,

Mes. ANNA DILLENBECK

Two letterhead memoranda forwarded covering inter-
views at Endicott, N.Y¥., on 2/11/58 and 3/12/58,

In respect to the interview of DILLENBECK on
2/11/58 this was set out initially in report of SA PATRICK A.

MUNLEY dated 4/30/58 at Albany, captioned "JOSEPH BARBARA, ’SR.,

Was., Anti-Racketeering,'' which is not suitable for dissemina-
tion. It should be noted that the report indicates that the
investigation was conducted by SA DARWIN DB, SHATRAW; however,
in checking SA PATRICK A. MUNLEY was present during the
interview which was jointly conducted by these two Agents.

The memo reflects these Agents conducted the interview and

it is requested that Bureau copies of the report be aléered
to make this correction (at page 26). Albany reports have
been corrected.

The interview on 3/12/58 was initially set out in
Albany letter to Philadelphia 3/24/58 (interoffice).
