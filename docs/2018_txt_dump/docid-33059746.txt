ON
COVERT ACTIONS IN VIETNAM nee
(Keyed to 28 November Report) \ eae:

 

1. a. Montagnard (Highlander) Program:

No significant change.

 

b. Rural Reconstruction Operations:

No significant change.
ce. Para-Milit: Intelligence Operations Against Viet Co in South
Laos, South Vietnam, and North Vietnam; Commercial Air Cover Company :
The ‘gunk which departed for North Vietnam on a mission to
resupply an agent in the area of Quang Yen (northeast of Haiphong)

‘turned back because of bad weather and heavy seas. An attempt will
be made to resupply the agent as soon as weather conditions permit.

The agent team near Dien Bien Phu advised Saigon, using 4
danger signal in a radio message, that it was under DRV control.
This is-the second team of four originally infiltrated into North
Vietnam to be captured by the DRV. False instructions are being
radioed to the team instructing them to prepare for a notional
airdrop. The fiction is being attempted by Saigon in an effort to
keep the team alive in the remote hope that the DRV might consider
the team has been doubled against the GVN and permit them to exfiltrate.

There has been no radio contact with the agent team in the Dong
Hoi area.of North Vietnam since 2 December 1961. :

Four agents who are residents of Pak Sane, Laos (near the Lao-
Thai border in Vientiene Province), have been recruited to infil-
trate overland into the Vinh area of North Vietnam to observe and
report on military traffic along Route 7.

overland from Lao Bao on Route 9, South Vietnam, into South Laos
to reconnoiter the Sa Moi area and verify reports that the Vietnamese
Communists have established two installations in the area. If the
Viet Communist installations are located, the CLAS unit will attack
and attempt to destroy them. Three 14-man paramilitary teams will |
accompany the CLAS unit during the initial stages of this operation.
The paramilitary teams will then move westward into the vicinity of
Muong Nong, Laos (approximately 25 miles southeast of Tchepone).

Three paramilitary teams used in the search for a missing MAAG
sergeant traced him to a Vietnamese Commmist camp 30 miles northwest of

namese Communist camp. The information was passed to a Vietnamese air-
borne brigade for follow up action.
