"E1 Condor" organization Claims Credit

On 10/6/76, the "Miami Herald" received a telephone
call at 10 p.m., froman individual who said the "El Condor"
organization was responsible for placing the bomb. This
call was received after extensive, news, coverage of the crash A

‘There is no known "El Condor" organization in the Miami,
Florida, area, and the only previous use of the name "El Condor"
to claim credit for terrorist activities was by anti-Castro
Cuban terrorist, Rolando Otero in "Military Communiques," he
issued after several bombings in Miami in December, 1975,

Otero is in jail in Miami awaiting trial on these charges. u

This claim is believed to be without substance;
however, it has caused Caribbean countries to speculate freely
that anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Miami were responsible for
the crash of the airliner, .

Ricardo contacted Legat approximately four times
after initial visitfand on two occasions furnished Legat
data on members of Cuban Embassy which were > obviously
obtained from DISIP filesl¢(3)

On 9/30/76, Ricardo appeared unannounced at American
Embassy and requested assistance in obtaining a visa to U.S,
Since he had a photographic assignment for "Vision" Magazine
. in Jamaica and planned a two-day stopover in Puerto Rico, |
Ricardo stated that he intended to leave on 10/1/76 and
Since a travel agency told him the visa process would take
three days, requested Legat's assistance, [{/

Fieview of Ricardo's passport reflected that Ricazido

recalled that the bombing of the Guyanese Consulate in

Zs Port-of-Spain had occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m.,
on 9/1/76, and wondered in view of Ricardo's association
with Imis Posada, if his presence there during that period
was coincidence. (CORU publicly claimed credit for this |
attack.) Legat informed Chief, Nonimmigrant Visa Section
(NIVS), he wished no special consideration for Ricardo, and
requested the issuance of a visa to him be considered on its
own merits. (ih)

On 10/1/76, at the request of Ricardo, Legat communicated .
with Vice Consul who wished to know if Legat believed Ricardo
would return to Venezuela after his visit inthe U.S., or if
he was likely to remain there illegally. Legat informed the
Vice Consul he had no reason to believe Ricardo would not
return to Caracas. y

~ oR In a conversation with an official of DISIP on 10/1/76,
Legat broached the subject of Ricardo and of the faint suspicion
that Ricardosm have been somehow involved in the bombing of

Department of State (DOS) Reaction

Since the escalation of CORU terrorist activities,
DOS has sought the deportation of Bosch first from Nicaragua,
and now, because of this incident, from Venezuela. Bosch is
“a Federal fugitive from the U.S., wanted for parole violation.
He was originally sentenced to a ten-year prison term in 1968
on charges relating to conspiracy, extortion and bombings. On
12/19/72, Bosch was paroled after serving four years. Following
an interview with a news reporter in which he publicly admitted
. sending letter bombs to Cuban Embassies, ‘the U.S. Parole Board
issued'a warrant for his arrest. Bosch thereafter went
