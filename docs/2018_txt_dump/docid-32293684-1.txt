and[upon KOVALEV's return to the US, tempts will be
made to place FORBES in contact with the subject .¥S )

the subject, it is believed that LIBBY HOLMAN REYNOLDS :

is identical with the subject of New Haven filé 100- ce

Bufile 100-363343 and NY file 100-103066, who is an STi:

subject of the New Haven Of fice. (R)

Further in regard to this matter, FORBES advised :
that he was unable to further identify the "producer" or a
the four "beatniks" who attended the party at LIBBY ;
HOLMAN REYNOLDS! apartment. He added that he was not
‘familiar with the circumstances of how LIBBY HOLMAN
REYNOLDS originally[met KOVALEV and KIR UK or the extent
of her association with these Soviets, owever, he advised . {
that should he obtain additional information concerning
these matters, he would immediately notify the NYO. (&)

d all outstanding leads haVe been covered,
this case is being placedin a closed status. / Upon KOVALEV's
return to this country, this case will be reopened and NY
will continue its investigation of KOVALEV as a "Known
Soviet Intelligence Agent" pursuant to Section 105K of the
