He said that his customers are all colored and that he pays
no protection to anyone in the law enforcement agencies or
to anyone in order to operate. He said that he has never
been approached by any person or any group of persons with
regard to combining his operation into a large Bolita

set up and has stated, as above, his operation is entirely
independent.

STAHL advised that he is not completely familiar
with the extent of Bolita operations in the Miami area but
that based on what he has heard he would estimate that there
are approximately twenty individual operations quite similar
to his presently running in the Miami area. He said that
in addition he would estimate that there are perhaps half
a dozen Bolita houses operating, the volume of which would
be many times larger than his.

on 4/15/63 and 4/23/63, FRANK LANG "LEFTY" ROSENTHAL,
FBI Number 441 756 D, advised SA WARREN R. WELSH that he is
presently employed as a sports consultant with the Multiple
Sports News Service, 1090 N. E. 79th Street, Miami, Florida.
This service subscribes to the following telephone numbers:

PL 4-0637
PL 4-0638
PL 4-0639
PL 4-0640

His partner in this operation, which is run on the
order of ANGEL KAPLAN's operation in Chicago, is SAMUEL S.
GREEN, FBI Number 480 589 C, a known gambler. ROSENTHAL
stated that this service will deal in sports (baseball, basket-
ball, football andithockey) and in horse racing. The service
also has a Western Union sports ticker, which is used for the
gathering of general sports information.

ROSENTHAL, who presently resides at the Beaux Arts
Apartments, 8000 West Drive, North Bay Village, Florida, has
been described as a big lay-off better and purportedly makes
the line on baseball, football and basketball games in the
United States. He is presently fighting extradition from
Miami, Florida to Macklenburg County, North Carolina, where
he has been indicted for bribing college basketball players.
