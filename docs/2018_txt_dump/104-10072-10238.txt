4. Production: Just before his operation [W/Z received
a letter from]/Guillermo Bedregal which was sent from Caracas.
Bedregal had”“seen Bolivian Planning Minister Jose Ortiz
Mercado in Caracas. Ortiz said that the Bolivian government
either wanted in effect to work an alliance with Paz without.
the MNR, or with the MNR without Paz. One idea was for Paz
to remain in Lima and to give his blessings on MNR people to
join the government. Paz had already rejected the idea of
Paz without the MNR. Ortiz told Bedregal that he was anxious
to see Juan Lechin Oquendo, who had been in Caracas, but had
disappeared. (He is reputed to have gone. to Europe.)
Bedregal had seen Lechin a month before he talked to Ortiz.
At that time Lechin had said that he would have nothing to
do with the Bolivian government. He was very vengeful and
bitter. Bedregal said that he has become even more radical.
Lechin said that the was willing to enter into conversations
ith Paz. :
