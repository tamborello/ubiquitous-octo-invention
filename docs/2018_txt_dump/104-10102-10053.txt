SUBJECT: Review of ico City Station Files
at th Record's Center

1. On 2 May,1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture
visited the |Record's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search of additional photographs of the
“unidentified man. We were unable to locate any such
photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have
been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and

that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters

for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed
and pertinent notations re re-use of the old folders:
