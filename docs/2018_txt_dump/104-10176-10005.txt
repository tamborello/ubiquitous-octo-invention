2, There ie lictle question that LIRIHG*3 ‘seized the opportunity, gives
hia by the sudden spperition of GROZCO om the scene to cover via a vis bis
wife a few daya of nisbehaving. Inatead of proceadixg to Tapachule to receive
from the FAR new contxact icstructions in Mexico Gity (an evkwerd errangemnt
to say the least), LIEING-3 remained st the safe hocee be uses in the capital
to receive tha visit (22 indicated by LIFZAT) of Berta WIGISSER bis “regular™
mistress, Silvia DURA (of Lea Harvey OSWALD fame} ard possibly a certein
Yolsada (vho appears for the first time in this operaticn and whose phone
gumber ig not in the Station reversed Hexico City telepione directory}
Pinned down on the fact that ke waa in Mexico. City during the period of 19
to 21 July, LIRISG<3 admitted that he wae but fele thst he had to tell
another lic racher than edait his misbehavior, This lie was that he did not
want to appesr dependant on Sergio VALDEZ in the eyes of ROWTON aad so
wade hio first meeting with OROZCO “core intriguing” by inventing the trip
to Tepachula. To add credence to the Tepechulea story, LIRING*3 previously
asked his vife to imprese ROWIOH with her concern fer his, telling ROVTOS
that he hed disappeared for three days without telling ker where he went.
This she did very convinciogly with auch sobbing and crying. The LIRCSIN
LP which continues to experience technical difficulties now and then did not
operate properly that day (it's recorder broke down) but, ag luck will have
it LIROSIN live monitored « conversation between LIRING“3 and his wife
éuring which the latter r ported that her tears seemed to have convinced
DRIMAE Ban thae eaiee ne whdeh OTE had nme nretty hinnt talk with
LIRIRG-3 coacerned the nection of the alias which ROWTOS uses with LIRING?3
and 4 to various persons with whom LIRIEG?3 ie in tocch. LIFEAT coverage
hed indicated, for example, that LIRING+3 mentioned EOsTOd im alias to
Sergio VALVEBZ, This LIRING-3 denied, He produced on 3 Auguet 1967 a

‘written review of all the people of interest to ROWTON withwhom he has
been im contact indicating whether or not he sentioned KOKTOH's alias to
them, This review is attached to, one of ROWPOH's reports dated 9 August.

 

 

3. What happened between OROZCO, LIRING"3, Sergio TALDEZ and Raul
MORENO ic explained in detail in ROWFOd's reports forwarded with this
dispatch. A few additional potnts should probably be made here, Fizat of
all, part of the first meeting between LIRING*3 and O8CZCO et LIRIRC_3's
sefehouse was live-maitored by LIROSIN when the Istter returned home from
his reguler bartending job in the early hours of the norning, LIROSIN
heard enough (his recorder was ouce wore inoperative} to basically confira
LIRING“3's report of his meeting with OR0ZCO te ROWEON. Secondly, neither
VALDEZ nor MCRENO were present during the night of 31 July - 1 August vhea
LERING?3 told OROZCO that the latter was in fect a deserter from the FAR,
vefusing to indicate how he knew this (ROWTON had passed LIRING"3 icforsation
on OROZCO received by the Station from both LIRSBEL°] and 2), The two mea
arrived at LIRING*3's apartment in the early morning hours when OROZCO
hed admitted everything and thus do not know what prompted him te tell the
. truth, Thirdly, LYRING?3 Neists that he told OROZCO nothing about hie
- plastic flower business and it's contempleted use to ccver activities in
- eupport of the Guatemalan rebels. According to his, C&0ZCO already knew
thie as vell as other details of hie dealinge with the FAR. LIBRING-3
presumes thet OROZCO learned this fro the higher-ups cf the FAR guerrillas
while im the hille. OROZCO alstskenly apparently thought- that LIRING-3 was
fin the actual ares precurement buginesa whereas his discussions with the
PAR have been limited up to cow to the eventual trapsportstioa of FAR
acquired supplies from Northern Mexico to Guatemala (with the PAR aseuming
the responsibility of smuggling these supplies over the Guatasslen border),
LIRING*3"s plastic flower business designed to cover support activities on
behalf of the PAR, fe not, as e antter of fact operetive yet. Thue OROZCO
was badly foformed of LIRING*}‘'s activities. How ORCZCO hoped to obtein eras
+ feom LIRING?3, bad the latter been able to deliver soma at the Guatemelas
’ border srea, in view of the fact (a9 he later edaitted) that he’ was stone
broke, fe a matter of conjecture, A desperate men my do desperate things
and LIRING"3 could have found himself in serious trosble. Judging from the |
FAR's shooting habits it is a good thing in any case that OROZCO was act-
armed during the argument at LIRING*3's apartment the cight of 31 July to
1 August, particularly when VALDEZ sterted to threaten hia,

4 This Station believes thet the LIRING?3 Operation has reached a |
eritical point as a result of the C20ZCO affair, Both the Cubana and the
FAR (via Ernesto CAPUANO Del Yecchic) have beenmwtified by LIRING-3 of |
O20200's conduct and statewsates (a copy of CROZCG's «seage forwarded as :
Attachment Two was given CAPUAHO}. If the FAR fie ot sli interested in
LIRING*3 he will somehow hear from the Guatesalan guerrillas and negociations
eoncerniag ares and equinzens will be reanped. LIPING*3 hee not hears from
"GARCIA" sincs Juns end does not even know if the latter is in Mexico.

It is the Station's gpinion thet he probably will hear nothing directly
from the Cubans.

5, Headquarters will note, per ROWEO8's report dated 28 July, the
weletive ease with which LIRIEG?3 claims to be obtaining a false passport
and other identity papers, The Cubso's pasaports that LIRING-3 purchased
im Huevo Laredo, mentioned in the ssae report, were iaasued in 1953 and 1959
and osy be of marginal value, They will nevertheless be forwarded to
Headquarters together with other documentation held by the bearers of these

passports,
