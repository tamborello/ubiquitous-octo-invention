1. This case requires an Enoch Arden decision.
2. The Subject has apparently performed valuable ser-

FBI in an undercover capacity, he testified for them against
eleven leaders of the 2», Communist’ + Party.

  

3, Much as ‘the Subject a appears to deserve a@ position
for his services, I do not see how we can accept him as a ~

 

publicity about his undercover work has blown his usefulness
in operations in as he will be a man marked by the ©
Reds from now on. Then, there is some question concerning
the reason that he was selected for recruitment by the
Communists although this can probably be clarified with

Mr. Papich.

 

4. It is recommended, therefore, that the request
for conversion be denied. Presumably there is no objection
to Subject's continued use as a contract employee for limited
duties after we clarify the question of his. recruitment by...
the Communists. oO .
