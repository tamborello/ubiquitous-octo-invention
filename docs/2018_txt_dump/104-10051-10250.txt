CASTRO's Cuba. DELGADO was probably the closest peer group.

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

‘the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO'S ““message"_ was significantly modulated. 2 oe *

' BACKGROUND

1. on Saturday evening, 7 September 1963, .

| Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in |

 

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

2. HARKER'’s interview reached New. York on Sunday,
8 September, and was in print throughout the cauntry on

Monday, 9 September. There: canbe. no question from the

Facts ‘surrounding the" ‘castRo" appdarence, which had not been

 

expected, and his agreement ‘to the interview, that this

 

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

6. The ‘New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,
used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference
to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real.
significance. The Washington Post did an ‘abbreviated re-~-
write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.
