about everything, laughed like a crazy man, and liked his
wife "very, very much." Further, he had stated that Oswald
saw how life was really like in Russia and was very disen-
chanted. Oswald wanted a lot and the Government "did every-
thing." He even tried Russian writing once and failed, as
usual. Then he expressed the desire to return to America
with his wife, also a wish of hers. ‘Golovachev asked, "What
are you going to do in America?" Golovachev was “inqui¥ing as
how was he going to earn money as he did not have a talent
for anything. Oswald replied, "Don't worry. There are

many ways to make good money." Oswald stated that he could

get "good money? for example, by killing the President in a

to

good way. Oswald further stated that "you don't know America.”

The people would make you a hero; they'd write books, maga-
zine articles, even make movies about you! Further, Oswald
implied that he most likely would not re¢eive the money per-
sonally but that the money would go to his wife.

. Golovachev further told Oslov that because of his
contact with Oswald, immediately following the assassination
of President Kennedy and identification of Oswald, the KGB

took him intocustody. After hours of questioning, , the KGB

It is surmised that as Golovachev became
garrulous while drinking, the KGB discovered that he was
still in. possession of a group photograph depicting Lee,
Marina and Golovachev among other people. Accordingly,
sometime in 1971 or 1972, the KGB took the photo.

Uslov explained that he wrote the complete story
in Russian and submitted it to the CIA.for transmittal to
the HSCA. They advised that it be translated to English.
In November of 1977, he sent the manuscript to Radio Freedom
on 42nd Street in New York City for translation and to be
forwarded to the Committee. It .is his belief that he was
contacted by the HSCA as a result of reading his manuscript.
He is presently attempting to locate his copy, which is in
Russian, ‘for our perusal.

After giving a full dissertation on life in Russia,
Uslov requested that his identity remain anonymous. He wanted
