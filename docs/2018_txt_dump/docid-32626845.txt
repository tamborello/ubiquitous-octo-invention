mandate. After careful consideration, we have concluded that following course

of action is appropriate under circunstances,

Accordingly, request you discuss course of action with J Thant or
Bunche in context above and on basis we are in effect responding te informal

nunber UN planeg, of intercepting Hatangan aircraft in fiight. sAccerdingly,
best mothod assuring they are put cut of commiasion is probably to strafe
them on ground. as we sea it, there are two major elenents to be considered

4m such aetion: 1) adequate justification; 2) advance notification.
