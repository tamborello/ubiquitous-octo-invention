Director of Security

SUBJECT: House Select Committee
on Assassinations Requests (U)

1. (U/AIUO) Action Requested: -None; for information |

2. (U/AIUO} Background: Reference is made to the
attached requests From the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA) dated 16 and 17 August 1978 (OLC
78-2589/1 and 78-2590/1). The HSCA has requested access
to all files and index references on Orestes Guillermo

- Perez Ruiz, Greg Vitale, and Cal Hicks and has asked that
Vitale, Hicks, and one be made available for
interview. :

(U/AIUO) Indices of the Office of Security have
been searched and disclosed no record of Orestes Guillermo
Perez Ruiz. We have been advised that Greg Vitale is
actually Guy Vitale on whom we have a file which is available
for review. A file is also available for review on Calvin W.
Hicks. It should be noted that the HSCA request on Vitale
and Hicks was limited to material covering the years 1960-
1973. The requests that individuals be made available for
interview requires no action by the Office of Security as
they appear to fall within the purview of the Office of

Legislative Counsel and the Office of General: Counsel.

(U/AIUO) Please contact Mr. Bruce Solie (red line
9126) or Mr. Harold Palmer (red line 1893) of this Office .
when HSCA staffers desire to review the above material.
