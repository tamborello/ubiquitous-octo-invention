For’ the information of the Bureau, reMM le

@}s cooperation in furnishing information of an i
2 nature to the Cuban Government.

a. On July 21 and September 23, 1965, MARTA
BALBUENA) (currently residing 927 S. W. 3rd Street, Apart-
“ment 4), advised she has received no further correspondence
soliciting her cooperation in furnishing information of an
intelligence nature to the Cuban Government. She stated
she would immediately advise the FBI should she receive
any further correspondence. MARIA MORENO (BALBUENA) has
stated she intends to take no action in regard to answering
the letter she received out of fear of jeopardizing her
chances of getting her daughters out of Cuba.

It appears’
she has little, if any, potential for development as a
.PSI, and for this reason her case is being closed.
