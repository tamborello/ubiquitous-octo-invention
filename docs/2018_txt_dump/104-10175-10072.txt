SUBJECT: June-COEB

 

Pursuant to cur earlier conversations on Sebject, I wish te advise you
that Subject has proved of long range value to the Agency as a contrelled
fellow traveler, and has also proved that she is a prime source on the
Fair Play for Cuba Cosmittee. As you know, the FBI has expressed an interest
in such information that Subject can provide concerning the Fair Play .
Committees. I have no objection to an FSI interview of Subject if this can t
be done under circumstances which will not camage her operational potential
for. this Agency. I do stranciv eromae neweran ser met sf DN Iilh eee
witness for any case developed ty the Bureau against the Fair Play Coamittes.
