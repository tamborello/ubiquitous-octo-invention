It is to be noted that Phila. has encountered -
technical difficulties in regard to PH 7O1M=C* Since its
installation.

SA J, ROBERT PEARCE on 8/18/64 ascertained that
the loss of volume was caused by a shortage of the installa-
tion within the Resident Agency in Wilkes-Barre. This has
been remedied and it is hoped that the quality and. quantity:
of information received from this source will increase.

On 8/13/64 source furnished information that
BUFALINO was expected to be in New York on August 21.
Source also advised that BUFALINO had the feeling his
telephone was "tapped." a

On 8/18/64, after correction of installation
mentioned above, source advised BUFALINO was in contact
with one WILLIE (LNU). At this time BUFALINO set up a
meet with this person for Friday morning.

 

On 8/21/64 source advised BUFALINO was to meet ~
WILLIAM BUFALINO JR.. of Detroit, who according to PH 665-C-
TE is the son of WILLIAM BUFALINO, a Detroit attorney who
has some connection with JAMES HOFFA.
