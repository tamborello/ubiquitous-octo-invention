NSD reiterates that all FBI sources are given an
expressed promise of confidentiality. As explained above, not
only would the release of these informants' names violate that
promise, it would also be detriméntal to FBI future informant
development since the granting of confidentiality is paramount in
gaining a potential informant's confidence and cooperation.
Furthermore, the mass release of this many informants would set
precedent for releasing future informant identities and thus
severely hamper the FBI's ability to protect same. (XU)

In short, the supposed historical significance of the
release of the identity of these individuals posed by ARRB cannot
logically outweigh the potential danger to them or their
families. Once confidentiality is granted, the FBI is obligated
to protect the identity of bona fide sources and informants
absent statements by them to the contrary. (U)

#23 thru #27 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the
release of information that would release the code word
"Tumbleweed" and other information related to this double agent
operation. (The use of assets in double agent operations is an
indispensable method used by the FBI to gain information from
persons affiliated with or having access to foreign intelligence
services. The ability of the FBI to assure double agents that
the confidentiality of the relationship will be maintained is
required to ensure future trust and cooperation by others.) (S)

#28 and #32 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the release
of information relating to FBI investigation of foreign
officials. By letter dated January 26, 1996, the Department of
State advised that no documents related to the assassination
should be released if they constitute acknowledgement of
investigation of foreign diplomatic officials and establishments
in the United States. In the Department's opinion, disclosure of
these counterintelligence investigations could have a significant
adverse effect on U.S. foreign relations. (¢

#29 thru #31, and #33 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal
the release information obtained from a technical surveillance of
the Dominican Republic, as well as information related to
contacts with the Soviet Embassy and information that would
reveal a mail cover on the Soviet Embassy. As previously
articulated by the JFKTF, investigative methods and techniques
may vary in application, but do not normally diminish in
importance with time. Public exposure of the FBI's above
investigative methods and techniques would cause harm to the
FBI's foreign counterintelligence capabilities. It would also

. likely result in countermeasures against such coverages and thus
, lessen their value. CH

Re: (U) 62-HQ-1029205, 11/05/1996

(U) As mentioned previously, the JFKTF searches the
open and closed indices at Headquarters and reviews any files
identical with the subject for additional identifying personal
information. The JFKTF requests the field office to search their
indices, review any identifiable documents and respond with the
appropriate information. This information is forwarded to the
Butte Information and Technology Center (BITC)for their search of
the various data bases for current physical status, death record
or location. The JFKTF provides this information to the ARRB to
support the FBI's request to sustain the postponement of names
and singular information. Currently the ARRB releases the
identities and singular information on all sources with no
information available and ‘those deceased. This includes sources
with foreign citizenship, which the BITC cannot search.

(U) The 33 documents concerning the decisions from the
current meeting, which the FBI may wish to appeal, are listed
below by document number with the information to be released. The
status of informants and sources, if found through research, is
noted after the name with living (L), deceased (D), no record
(NR) or date of birth (DOB).

(U) The FBI provided written justifications presenting
the evidence available to. protect the individuals, singular
information, technical information, and classified information
related to methods, sources and foreign relations as listed
above. However, the ARRB supports the position that the i
information ordered disclosed is relevant and significant to the
assassination. They opine the pertinence and importance to the
assassination outweigh any current harm to the individuals or the
FBI's/United States Government's Foreign relations, informants,
or operational aspects.

~ (U) If CID or NSD recommend appealing, please provide
the addendum with reasons to the JFKTF and-.oac by 11/07/1996, as
the FBI only has 7 days to appeal upon receipt of the letter. If
you have any questions, please contact Carol L. Keeley at
extension 9494 or Carl Valentine at extension 9476.

(W® Additionally at this meeting, the ARRB agreed to
postpone the technical information concerning a surveillance on
Marina Oswald. In HQ 62-109060-7406, NAR 124-10067-10448 (copy
