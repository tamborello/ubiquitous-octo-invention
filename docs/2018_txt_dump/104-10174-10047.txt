he On 7 January I ‘contacted Tichborn who suid that he could be in!
Washington on Lh. January and that he vould have to return to Los Angeles
by 3 February. I asked bin what his fee would be ‘and he said that it -
was his understanding that he had previously talked in the neighborhood -
of $1,500 to $1, 600. I countered by saying that in view.of the shortnes§
of this trip I did aot feel I could do any better than $1,300, which he t
accepted, I asked him if he desired that we advance him any money at —
this time or if he could buy his ticket on the cuff and that we. vould
make some.snrt of arrangements while be was in Washington, and he
said he woul’ buy his ticket and that he would abide by whatever
procedures wo normally follow. JI told him at this tine that I would

prefer that he bought a round trip ticket Los Angeles ~ New York -
I also instructed him upon arrival

Havana and that he proceed that way.

 

din New York to buy a ticket Washington - New York and return.

this aa I feel it-is preferable fron a security standpoint that he not
have any indication on the ticket he will use in entering Cuba that he
hes been in Washington immediately prior to the trip or that he intends
to return there following the trip.

5. ‘The substance of the above was commnicated to Mr. Dahlgren,

C/Wi/3, who egreed that in view ox the time factor 1t would be

preferable for Tichborn to come on the lstk rather than the 16th and that -

the price was right, etc. I confirmed the date. with Mr
contact Tichborn again, advising him to call me upon

Washington on 14 January.
