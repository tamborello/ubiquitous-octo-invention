Subject following the above staternent was that, "This
will be taken care of. It will be provided. " Perhaps
this reply to Subject cannot be interpreted by a person
other than Subject as a promise of a house, but it can

be construed as a promise of something and there may
have been other discussions with Subject in regard to
housing in the United States. .

Memorandum ;

File DATE: 14 August 1972

Deputy Chief, Security Research Staff

Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO

1. On 7 August 1972 following a discussion of several items
of intelligence interest, NOSENKO mentioned the matter of the proposed

- book, stating that he doubted it would sell a large number of copies.

Reason for this opinion, according to NOSENKO, was that he realized
the information was over eight years old and it was not in the form of
a "spy thriller. ' He thought that the majority of readers who would be |

_ attracted would be those who had an actual interest in the KGB and its

effect on Soviet life rather than individuals interested in entertaining
reading,

2. NOSENKO then stated there was something ‘he hesitated
to bring up, that he had hoped it would have been mentioned previously
by the undersigned and that he hoped his mention of it would not be mis-
construed. NOSENKO then stated that the matter was the salary to
which he considered he was entitled for the period of five years (April
1964 - 1 March 1969). The latter date is the date the current con-
tractual relationship with NOSENKO became effective.

3. NOSENKO stated that he is very grateful for what has
been done for him since 1969 and that he has no animosity for what
occurred previously even though it was "five years from his life. "
NOSENKO stated that he considered he is living very well although not
saving any money for the future. He stated that he had hoped to obtain
some extra money from the sale of a book but now doubts sufficient
copies will be sold for him to realize any sizable amount from royalties.
However, he is vitally interested in the book (or books) being published
since it, in his opinion, would "hurt the KGB."

20. As indicated above, a complete list of promises made

to Subject in 1964 is not available and for purposes of consideration
of whether Subject should be given some additional financial assist-
ance are not required. It is probably sufficient to list certain known
promises ‘made to Subject on 30 January 1964 with the specification

_ that they had been approved by Mr. Helms. These promises included:

(a) $50,000 deposited in a personal account for

Subject.

Subject certain personal matters which are or could be problems in

the future and which should be given appropriate consideration in the

which could or will arise.

report of the current situation in Subject case for any current action
or possible future action.
3. Subject is presently residing with wife at his previous ie
address. There do not appear to be any particular domestic problems.

well aware of this at the time of his marriage. Numerous comments
by Subject indicate that he is attached to the family of his wife and in

the opinion of the undersigned, the Subject is accepted as a member

what he believes was a commitment on the part of the Agency
to provide him with financial assistance in the purchase of
a home. A memorandum dated 16 February 1970, written by

Mr. Bruce Solie describes this verbal exchange between PDDONGR

and his case officer. (See Reference A). In addition, a
memorandum dated 14 August 1972 also written by Mr. Solie
(Reference B) states that "Nosenko stated that prior to his
defection in Geneva, he discussed his future with Bagley and
made three requests, these being:

a. Employment at $25,000 per year;
b. $50,000 in savings account;
c. Assistance in purchasing a house.

According to Nosenko, Bagley, a day or two later, informed
Nosenko that his requests had been approved and Nosenko
considers this constituted a valid verbal contract."

3. From PDDONOR's viewpoint therefore an additional
commitment, quite separate and apart from the three Listed
in paragraph 1 was made to him. Consequently, he now argues.
that a payment made to him in July 1970, in the amount of
$20,000 and which he used as a downpayment on a house, was
the fulfillment of this additional commitment and not part
of the $50,000 he was promised for his two years in place.

° This despite the fact that in the 14 August 1972 memorandum

as Mr. Solie states in paragraph 5, . . . "Nosenko also
considers that the assistance in purchasing furniture, a
house, etc., which he has been given since 1969 should be

considered as cancelling the matter of the $50,000.

4. What seems to have occurred is a change of position
on PDDONOR's part. While previously acknowledging that the
original. $50,000 commitment had been met (paragraph 5 of
Reference B) PDDONOR now takes the position that of the
below listed payments only $30,000 should be applied against
the $50,000 commitment. The July 1970 payment of $20,000 —
should be applied against a separate commitment to provide
assistance in purchasing a home.

$2,000 in March 1964
$8,000 in May 1969
$5,000 on 1 July 1970
$20,000 on 1 July 1970 (According to PDDONOR this
payment should not be applied
against the $50,000 commitment)

 

$15,000 on 12 July 1973

Thus, according to PDDONOR's reasoning $20,000 is still due him
as part of the original $50,000 commitment.

-5. Several additional points should be noted. On 2 July
1973 PDDONOR signed an "Acknowledgment and Release" prepared
by the General Counsel in which PDDONOR releases and forever
discharges the US Government and the Agency from any claim for
money promised to him. (Reference C). In addition, the issue
of the $20,000 he says is still owed him does not surface in
the file until September 1978, 14 years after his defection.
The explanation of why this issue would arise at this late
date is not clear from available records. .

 

6. Attached are copies of those documents which impact
: on this issue. Because of the complexities of this case I
recommend that we request the Office of General Counsel to
review the entire case and provide a ruling on the legitimacy
of PDDONOR's claim of $20,000. After such a ruling we can
discuss our future course of action. : .

Dated 12 July 1973

: 1. A careful review of the PDDONOR file substantiates
the fact that there were three unequivocal financial commit-
ments made to PDDONOR at the time of his defection in
February 1964. These three commitments were:

a. He would be paid $25,000 for each of the two
years he cooperated in place. Total $50,000.

_b. He would receive $10,000 for his part in
identifying William Vassal, a British
Admiralty employee as a KGB agent.

c. He would receive $25,000 per year salary
from the Agency. :

2. The question at issue now is whether an additional
commitment was also made to PDDONOR to the effect that the
Agency would provide financial assistance to him to purchase
a home. According to PDDONOR, on 30 January 1964 in Geneva
prior to his defection in a conversation with his case officer,
Mr. Tennent Bagley he stated, "I will arrive with what I have
on my back - no home - no roof - no anything." The reply to
PDDONOR was as follows; "This will be taken care of. It will
be provided." This exchange in PDDONOR's view, constituted
