flight nor does he recall issuing any such .order. He believes
very strongly that if any such flight or order had come to his
attention he would have remembered it.

During our conversation the General excused himself and
went to his basement and then returned with a flight log book.
After :fingering through his book he stated that he did have a
personnel plane assigned to him. He described the plane as
being a V-5-54-P model airplane ~ Service #90392. He also
stated that when this plane 'was not being used by him it was
not unusual for the plane to be used to fly other missions,
without his knowledge. He repeated that he had no knowledge
of any flights to Japan concerning LHO nor did he sign-any orders
directing any such flight. The General did state that it was
very possible that orders could have come down from Naval’ head-
‘quarters in Washington, ordering such a flight ‘and he might not
know anything about it.

When asked about the official log book for this plane,
in an effort to verify all flights by this plane, the General
indicated that the official flight logs for any military air
‘craft remain’ with: the plane. When the plané was permanently
deactivated, it is his belief that’ the log book and the offi-
cial records concerning the plane would have been’ sent to either
Marine Operations or to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington,
D:C. He also stated’ that he did not know if the plane was

still active or not.
