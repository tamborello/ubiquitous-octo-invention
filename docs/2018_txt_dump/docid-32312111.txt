for MARK LANE. S ,

In 1966, MARK LANE, who in the meantime had
Married a Dane and temporarily settled in Denmark, published
a book entitled Rush to Judgment, the substance of which is
that the murder of the President was not the work of a Single
individual, but a conspiracy. Based on this book, a
documentary film was subsequently produced. Moreover, in
“the course of the years since the assassination, MARK LANE

At the Congress, JORGEN JACOBSEN met the American
lawyer MARK LANE, who in his capacity of chairman of the
"Citizens! Committee of Inquiry" was working on an
independent inquiry into. the murder, having no confidence in
the material prepared by the Dallas Police.€§ )

Between JORGEN JACOBSEN and MARK LANE cooperation
was. established on this draft resolution, which, incidentally,
was adopted by the Congress. This cooperation was developed
further, and led to the establishment in Denmark of a so-
called "Mark Lane Committee" for the purpose of collecting
all available information on the assassination of the
President. and. informing the public of any hushed-up .or
suppressed details concerning the murder. §

Following the Congress, however, MARK LANE himself
went to Denmark, where, in the "Lawyers' Debating Club," ~
the "Students' Association” in Copenhagen, and the "Students'
Society” in Arhus, he told about his inquiries so far, aiming
at proving that reactionary, fascist circles were behind the
assassination of President KENNEDY .('$”) -

The Danish "Mark Lane Committee," which may be _
considered as long since dissolved, comprised a total of 16
indwiduals; the founder, JORGEN JACOBSEN, is known as a’
Communist, whereas the others mainly belonged to cultural,
ieft-wing literary circles. However, the activities of the
Committee, mainly based on MARK LANE's inquiries in the
United States, failed. to bring forth any sensational
disclosures. The work of the American authorities on the —

.case was, on the other hand, criticized and CS). of

the Warren Commission was denounced as a fraud. S)

In connectin with the references of the Danish
press to this matter, in November, 1964, the "Berlingske
Tidende" published an article, the contents of which MARK LANE
considered defamatory. The result was a libel action against
the newspaper, and. on November. 11, 1965, the High Court found
the statements of the paper ill-founded. The responsible(s)

CEORGE LANE stated that it. was his distinct
impression from-his contact with MARK LANE. that MARK LANE
is an agitator who is interested in stirring up racial
disturbances, particularly in the Arcadia and Immokalee,

information to the attention of DeSoto County Sheriff
FRANK CLINE, Arcadia, Florida. - :

' GEORGE and VIRGINIA LANE advised that during
their meeting with MARK LANE and CAROLYN MUGAR, they 4
received the very definite impression that MARK LANE and~
MUGAR are romantically involved, although MUGAR appears
much younger than MARK LANE. MUGAR appears to be a "wild,
"hippie'"’ type, and during conversation she indicated that
she assists MARK LANE as a photographer. _

GEORGE and VIRGINIA LANE advised that besides the
interest which MARK LANE and MUGAR evidenced in the
RICHARDSON case, they also appeared very interested in any
trouble spots in Florida, such as Negro unrest and
mistreatment of Indians.

On October 29, 1969, a confidential source abroad

advised that during the month of October, 1969, an organizat
known as the "English Language Committee” was created in Par
France, with the objective of opposing the continuation of |
the war in Vietnam, as well as. the following additional
objectives: (s} 7 oe A

discussed alleged resistance within the U. 8. Army tc the
war in Vietnam, claiming that the “brass” was going to
extremes to stifle dissent. LANE asked his German audience.
to assist those soldiers who want. to desert or fight the
