investigatipr/of the murder of the Rev.
Dr. Marti’ Luther King, committee
sources say, .

Committee investigators say the. group
may hav# beef the link-between James
Earl Rgy, who pleaded guilty of the
murder, anda St. Loulg lawyer who may
‘have-wanted King killed. -

Committee: sources say they consider
thiy avenue of investigation the most
prymising explanation of # conspiracy
théory in the assassination. of the civil
tights leader in Memphis in.April 1968;
But they-acknowledge that.thus.far they
have little hard evidence to prove-it.

The theory revolves around'St. Louis

‘j George Wallace for President campaign ‘

and segregationist, contacted a south 'St.
Louis man involved with-him in several

right-wing ‘groups conveying a money |

offer for King’s murder..At.the.time the
man was canvassing businesses in the
neighborhood.of‘the Grapevine for the
Wallace campaign. .

The committee’s theory fs that the
man could have mentioned the offer to
John Larry Ray, who could have.passed
it on to his brother. John Larry Ray
denied to the Post-Dispatch that any
such proposal was-made. Sutherland and
the other man are dead,

Gordon Baum, of St. Louis, field
director of the Citizens‘Council, has been
subpoenaed to testify before the commit-
tee, and sources said other subpoenas
are likely.

Baum, who was:active in the work-of
the council and the Wallace campaign-in
1968, confirmed in.an interview-that the

committee appears to be scrutinizing -

persons who were connected with both
groups.in that period.

He accused the committee ‘of ‘‘a
systematic purge of right-wing groups in
St. Louis.””

The committee has held hearings on *

the King assassination and plans to
continue them.in-Navember. The. panel
has heard testimony from Russell G.
Byers of Rock Hill that Sutherland and
another. man offered him $50,000 in 1967

to arrange for King’s murder. Byers said :

, he turned down the offer.

Investigators. believe that Suthérland oa
then contacted his acquaintance with the ©

Wallace campaign, who was canvassing
around the Grapevine, .

The committee also has learned that a,"

woman who was a top official. of the
Citizens Council and the Wallace cam-

paign lived in the 2100 block of Arsenal _

Street, within 100 yards of the Grape-
vine.

‘The woman, who also is dead, often
had planning meetings of the two groups
at her home. The Wallace canvasser was

a good friend of hers and together the :

two shouldered most of the responsibili-

ties of the Wallace state headquarters, "
The woman generally ran the office, :

near Gravois Avenue and Morganford
