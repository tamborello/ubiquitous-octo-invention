House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be
checked with each of the.Government agencies that are mentioned
in it. State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of
the passport to the man to come back to this country and that :
has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc. - i
all of which of course we are gathering. The aspects of the .
Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned. It is his
intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be i
sure that whatever is said in the report is conferred in and it

is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So youwill _
have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said
and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make.

DCI: Well that will be fine. Thank you

Hp Good bye.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCI AND J. EDGAR HOOVER
26 November 1963 - 11:20 a. in, tae

DCI: I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency
is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection
with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know
the importance the President places on this investigation
you are making. He asked me personally whether CIA was
giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just
wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

H: We have had the very best support that we could pos sibly i
expect from you.

Det: Good, Well you can call on us for anything we have.

EB: We will feel free to do that

DCI: I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report
and I am delighted that the President has called on you to
make it.

H: We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man
was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question
‘that he is the right man. There are a lot of aspects that we have |
dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter i: Mexico City.
We have now found that the: photograph that was ta cen was not
that of Oswald. We do find from our informant do.m there that
Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has -. i
given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit r
to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him
the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wold take three
weeks. He had, I think, ‘a visitor's permit for about a week or :
ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

 

DCI: Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have
- those operational sources down there. We want to handle them
. very carefully. It involves some very high level people down
there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

16a ns of Lee Harvey OSWALD's

@tion with the Agenc

    

velsrandun of Conversation, Dan
eRather/Les Midgley and the DCI,
os Dated 6 September 1975

 

1. The referent memorandum contains two points
which require comments. The first point concerns
allegations that were made shortly after the assassination
of President Kennedy and that ve crept up every so often
since then. In one form or so! xr, the allegations are
that Lee Harvey OSWALD had Bex / connected with the Agency.
The allegations are totaly .uifounded.

~) : Cy »

  

tter are as follows:

2. The facts rege in

Mr. R.G. Roca@s y immed: te superior at that time, to
make a tho ws chee thin the Agency at Headquarters
ne

  

to determi ee Harvey OSWALD had ever been |
used by the Agenc or been connected with it in any |
conceivable way. e ordered me to make the checks
. directly and personally to the degree possible and not
to accept statements of intermediaries. He also ex- |
plained that he was following instructions from-Mr. R. i
Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one ;of. the
Agency's key contact officials with the Warren. a |
Commission. ; LO .
b. Although I had already checke& the Main Index {
of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I
rechecked the Main Index and found no record beyond i
that which I had already obtained. before (plus: those
items which had been integrated into. the records system :
since the assassination). There was nothing in the DDO |
records which indicated any Agency connection with |
OSWALD. |

4. I recall very clearly that we were extremely
concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American: returning
'-. from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by
DCD, thus having established contact with the Agency.
The same point has now, quite understandably,. beén made
by the two CBS newsmen. Having some knowledge of this i
subject I have personally concluded that there is valid |
reason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time. \
He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD
had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before
1957/1958. Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,
particularly by Americans, before that time was quite |
uncommon and we. were hungry for eyewitness information in |
|

those days. The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end
of that decade @ were so many persons travelling to
and from the Sovie\sunion that DCD was incapable of talk-
ing to all of Alem: Therefore, a program of selectivity
and specific-taryet pplicability was instituted. In
light of th@NaBov . seems to me that OSWALD-- if he

a hould be added that my above-described
search in e Agency file holding produced no record or
indication that any other US Government agency had -used !
him as a source or had considered him for recruitment.
