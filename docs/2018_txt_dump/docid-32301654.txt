TP T-1 advised that the Cuban Club facilities were
utilized by another anti-Castro group on'July 4, 1965, at
which time there had been a telephone call advising of a, ,
bomb placed in the building. This necessitated police search
of the building which resulted negatively. However, in ; .
view of this, the directors of the Cuban Club had established
a policy not to make their facilities available to Cuban
groups unless the majority of local groups petitioned the
group. For this reason, accordim to TP T-1, the long
list of delegates on the petitioning letter were set forth.
He pointed out, however, that this list included primarily
those organizations who met with or were closely associated
in Tampa yith the CACALC. .

On Avgust 4, 1965, TP T-2 advised that—Dr. 08h
Orlan schyAvila, head of an anti-Castro revolutionary ~.".
organization of Cuban Exiles known as the MIRR, was

planning to visit Tampa from August 12-14, 1965.. A

private meeting is scheduled on August 12 at the office

of CACALC, which is the residence of Enrique Someillan,
representative of the MIRR in Tampa. This meeting will be
‘for the purpose of organizing the program for a public

meeting to be held Saturday, August 14, 1965, at the Cuban
Club in Tampa, It is planned at this time to show movies

of the attempted sabotage of a Cuban vessel, "Arecelio
Iglesias", in Panama.
