Letter states the fdlowing in substance: I received your letter
of April 8th, two days ago. We have been in San Francisco since
last summer and often think back with pleasure about our trip in
the DDR. I am sending by regular mail a brochure which we wrote |
after our return. We often have the opportunity to talk about
the DDR. If new material, particularly statistical matters, is
available, we can put it to good use. Also other material on the
development of the DDR. Everything is going well for us, and we
hope the same for you and your femity.(¢)
