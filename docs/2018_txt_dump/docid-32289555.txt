‘one color photo of SANTO ‘TRAFFICANTE taken in
_ February, 1967. .

ADMINISTRATIVE:

Information from records of the General Telephone
_ Company, Tampa, Florida, was made available by Mr. ALTON. M.
\ - BRYANT, Security . Director.

On. 4/10/67, OM 148-PC, an admitted member of La
Cosa Nostra, advised he had ‘recently ‘observed a card in the
possession of LEW FARRELL in Des Moines, Iowa, and that the
card contained’ the namé GEORGE POLERA, President, American
Tallow Company, ~ Oak Hill, Florida. - He related that POLERA
was a personal friend of FARRELL's and believed legitimate,
however, had an ‘arrangement with SANTO TRAFFICANTE whereby
POLERA lists’ TRAFFICANTE as employed by him and indicating
payment in salary to TRAFFICANTE. of $25,000 to $30,000 per
year. He advised that this is done mérely so that TRAFFICANTE
will have a front for the money he.receives in the rackets, -
and that POLERA does pay Social Security for TRAFFICANTE. . .

 

On 4/27/67, SD 1064-C-TE advised SAS EDWARD MARI
and JOHN D. “ARMSTRONG that La Cosa. Nostra member JIMMY
FRATIANNO, originally from Cléveland, had been observed in
the, Los Angeles area meeting with former Cleveland hoodlums.

He stated that the hoodlums meeting with FRATIANNO included
FRANK JOHN VELOTTA (FBI No. 313999C) is attempting to get a
criminal felony charge outstanding ‘against him in the State of
Florida dropped or "fixed" and that VELOTTA apparently -
‘\ believes that TRAFFICANTE could get the State charge "fixed. "
He related that FRATIANNO has indicated that TRAFFICANTE, Boss
of the Florida LCN family, is an old friend of the informant’s, ,
and, therefore, VELOTTA hopes to obtain the informant’ s help =
with TRAFFICANTE. , . ;

On 4/25/67, TP 120~-C advised SA JOHN A. AMBLER that
apparently TRAFFICANTE uses namés other than his own, as on
occasion has seen. different laundry marks on TRAFFICANTE's -
shirts. He stated one mark, which has been seen and is recalled,
is "GAR." ‘He stated that many of TRAFFICANTE's shirts are
apparently custom-made and were made in. Switzerland, and that

_ the unique watch, which TRAFFICANTE recently gave to his wife,
was also made in Switzerland. ‘ He related that on an occasion

in April, prior to the newspaper account appearing in .the

Tampa paper reflecting that TRAFFICANTE was in New York, a
telephone call had been received.one afternoon at the TRAFFICANTE
residence, and that the call was made by. TRAFFICANTE and was a
long distance call, but that the origin of. the call was not
known. He remarked that TRAFFICANTE left instructions with

the person taking the call that his cousin would be at the
house and would leave a package. He related that later the Jv
same afternoon a white male: approximately fifty years of age,
short, stout build, balding, wearing glasses, and believed to ~
be either Italian or Latin, appeared at the front door of the.
-TRAFFICANTE residence in Tampa, and that when the door was

<5 answered, this individual advised that he was SANTO TRAFFICANTE's

cousin, and’ that he had a package for SANTO. He remarked that
this person then took a large roll of. bills bound by a rubber
band out of his pocket and handed them. to the person answering
the door, He stated that apparently this individual had

parked his car some distance away from the residence, as there -
was no car observed in the vicinity When the doorbell was
answered, .

d . - . .
‘ : “TP 120-C stated that later in the afternoon Mrs.
TRAFFICANTE came back ‘to the residence and wanted to know if
someone had been by and left a package. He related that he
has no way of knowing the amount of money contained in the
roll; but from a quick glance, noticed that most of the bills
appéared to be. twenties and hundreds. TP 120-C is of the
opinion this particular individual has never been at the
TRAFFICANTE residence previously,.and that, in addition, just
before. SANTO TRAFFICANTE appeared in New York, both he and | _
‘Mrs, “TRAFFICANTE were in Tampa, but both were absent from the
TRAFFICANTE residence for a short period of time: He stated
that during this absence, it was noted that there was a sum

‘of monéy in the house in excess of $7,000.00, consisting.

primarily of $100 bills. He stated he does not know how

much more was in the pile of money, as he had stopped at
' $7,000.00, due. to the fact he was fearful the TRAFFICANTEs
might return at any moment. TP 12042C advised that. this is

the only occasion when he observed. such a sum of money in

the residence, although he knows from actions of the TRAFFICANTE

immediate family that there are large sums kept inthe house.
