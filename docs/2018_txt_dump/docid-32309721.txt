: Concerning FABIAN's arrest, Detective Sergeant HARRY
DIETRICH of the St. Petersburg. Police Department stated to the |
newspapers "FABIAN's organization is the largest threat we —
have here in St. Petersburg, second only to the- TRAFFICANTEs.
The TRAFFICANTE gang grossed a million dollars yearly before —
their conviction in Pinellas County of lottery law violations."

PETE BENSE, PCI, advised that during the past sev-~-
eral months the TRAFFICANTEs had an operation in northern ~
Pinellas which had been knocked off by the Sheriff's Office
and that it was no longer active. He said that this'was a _
very small operation and the knock off was in the form of
a small arrest action.

GENUNG stated that GASPAR LA MOTT is operating a
combination with MRS. JOHN IPPOLITO, wife of "STRAW HAT.
JOHNNY® IPPOLITO, who is now serving a sentence after convic-
tion in United States District Court, Tampa, on a wagering
stamp violation.

Chief Criminal Deputy GENUNG advised that with the
break up of these three combinations there is little activity
right now in Clearwater and northern Pinellas County area,
‘but that he expects an immediate renewal any day.

: GENUNG stated that early in 1955 the Sheriff's
Office was using the technique of obtaining search warrants
for «moonshine to make bolita cases. He stated that this ~
arose from moonshine activity on the part of bolita operators
after the conviction of the TRAFFICANTEs in Pinéllas County
in the spring of 1955 and the resultant decline in bolita
gales. He stated that this was successful for a period but
was changed after several arrests.

GENUNG advised that within the past month he has
been contacted twice by PETE BENSE, bondsman, Clearwater, -
a PCI of this office, hinting that is a "local" man were «
operating the bolita there would be less criticism from the
population and enforcement would be easier if arrangements —
could be made for regular arrests and fines be levieds” ~
GENUNG stated that he did not know BENSE's principal as he
had clearly advised that nothing such as this plan would even
be considered by Sheriff SID SAUNDERS or by himself, GENUNG.

; ' As set forth earlier it shéwuld be recailed that

Pol PETE BENSE advised that he had obtained $300,000 at..:2% -
interest te use in his business operations and also stated’”
that he intended te back Justice of the Peace ED SILK’in the
approaching Sheriff's campaign. BENSE also made the state=> .
ment that.“what..was..good for PETE BENSE would have to be good’
for Pinellas County." . , . .

All violations indicated in this report have “been.
referred to the preper authorities for investigative action.

Detective QUILLIGAN further advised that it is diffi-
eult to determine which writer is writing for which organiza-
tion because there is indication that they are changing from

Lieutenant BRUCE SIMMONS and Detective Sergeant ARTHUR

H. LEONARD (NA) have continued during the past six months
to afford excellent cooperation to this office. Generally
speaking, it appears that this Department has continued to
improve in organization, discipline and morale. During the
period covered by this report there has been no wide-open
gambling and there has been a definite absence of open
bookmaking and other forms of vice. Sneak gambling, such
as betting on horses and sporting events, has continued, but
no é@vidence has come to the attention of this office
indicating that there is an organized pay off to the Police
Department, or "okay" from the Police Department for the
operation of such.

: There has been the usual speculation that there
will be sneak "bust out" gambling houses in operation on
Miami Beach during the coming winter season, but as yet in-
formation has been non-specific and nothing has been learned
which would be indicative of police venality in this matter.,.

The only data which has come to our attention which
would make us skeptical of the integrity of Chief ROMEO J.
SHEPARD was a report received in August, 1954, by the New
York Office from its informant, NY-204-C, who has furnished
reliable information in the past. This was to the effect
that NY-204-C advised that he had become quite friendly with
SALVATORE GRANELLO, FBI # 2120006, In the course of conversations
with GRANELLO, this hoodlum mentioned various contacts he had ~-
in Miami and Miami Beach. The informant stated that GRANELLO
particularly mentioned having a "big in" with Chief of Police
SHEPARD at Miami Beach. According ‘to the informant, GRANELLO
stated that SHEPARD was the "bag man" in Miami Beach, and ~
GRANELLO stated he had eaten dinner with Chief SHEPARD on a.
few occasions. : ; ‘

. The informant furnished this information in
connection with the investigation of the matter entitled,
"CARMINEXDI BIASE, was., - FUGITIVE, UFAP - MURDER." GRANELLO

is report “the closest associate of this fugitive and is
suspected of having harbored him.

. GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE INTELLIGENCE FILE
“ BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA
JUNE 1, 1955 70 DECEMBER 1, 1955

The following information was obtained during the
course of regular investigation by Special Agents JOSEPH I.
GREALY, DENNIS J. O'SHEA and BEN W. GRIGSBY:

A. ORGANIZED GANGS

Investigation and contacts with informants and”
sources of information have failed to give any indication ~
that there are any organized gangs in Broward County at the

present time.

‘On July 9, 1955, MM-322-C. advised that” -aatphaxse,
Hollywood, Florida, had flown from Miami to.. Havana, alba; on’
‘July 8, 1955, to join his brother, MEYER LANSKY, # 731783, 2 A.
who had proceeded to Cuba from New York City; PE KASTEL, ay, ;
of New Orleans; and other unidentified syndicaté ehibers. fron LES,
Las Vegas, Nevada. Informant stated that a meeting was curr énitly
being held at Havana whereby these members of the National Crime
Syndicate were considering the purchase of a hotel or a gambling
casino in Havana.

On July 22, 1955, MM-551-PC advisedthat MEYE NSKY
had been in Havana, Guba during the early part of July, °1955, Crd
for two reasons: (1) as a guest of the Cuban Govérnment to LL
discuss the possibility of his bringing the mén into Cuba~to
operate gambling, He explained that BATISTA warited American”
tourists in Havana and was concerned.over the strong possibility
that "“bust-out operations" would keep the American trade away,
(2} To look over the possibility of purchasing a hotel in the.
heart of Havana for the purposes of operating gambling therein,

_ Informant stated that LANSKY had pointed out that it -
would be difficult to attract competent men away from Las Vegas,

 

 

DoclIda:32309721 Page 3

MM 62-1273

because most of them had settled down there and were content
to stay there. With regard to the second proposition, he
stated that LANSKY might go into the purchase of a hotel if
he could form a syndicate to put up the money to purchase
same.

On November 8, 1955, MM-551-PC stated that the
LANSKY brothers had still not made any deal whereby they
would take over a hotel and operate a gambling casino in
Havana, Cuba. He added that they were still discussing :
the possibility with a syndicate in New York City, but that
no definite decision had been made to date.

B. INDIVIDUAL RACKETEERS AND MOBSTERS

 

It was noted that in contacting informants and "
their sources of information, it was repeatedly pointed out
that individual racketeers and the mobsters for the most
part were not in the area during the past six months in’
view of/the fact that this is the off season for the Florida
