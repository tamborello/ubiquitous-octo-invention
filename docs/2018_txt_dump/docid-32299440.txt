UQUE to seize a key ‘off/the north coast of Cuba, in
order to embarrass the Inited States. No information

Cuba or against shipping off the coast of Cuba in the
immediate future. BOSCH claimed DUQUE has neither the ~
money nor equipment necessary for such operations, although
he is attempting to raise funds for the purchase of arms
for the Cuban underground,

previously, DUQUE had been visited by representatives of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service and presented .
with a "Notice of Prevention of Departure," which, ac-

of Dade County, BOSCH said that in view of this he did
not believe DUQUE was preparing to make an attack against
Cuba.
