ADMINISTRATIVE

On December 30, 1967, PCI R. L.. HANCOCK

MC GANN who then turned himself in to the Dallas PD
and was released on bond, MC GANN was charged with
the murder of TRUMAN CARTER in Dallas, July, 1967.
HANCOCK believes this was done by Captain WILL FRITZ
merely to make good on a boast he had previously
made that he would have someone arrested for this
murder befofe the end of the year 1967, HANCOCK
does not feel that MC GANN will be indicted for
this murder and no date was set for a hearing.

MC GANN was a suspect in a recent Dallas major.

stated he had heard nothing about color televisions
from MC GANN and MC GANN had called him 1/12/68,
Stating he would be out of town for a few days, but
did not say where he would be,

. On :2/13/68, PCI HANCOCK was informed |
that a Federal warrant is on file for MC GANN and
MC GANN is a fugitive. HANCOCK stated he does
not know where MC GANN is, but is quite certain
