Re Cleveland airtel 10/17/59.

On November 4, 1959, Mr. JAMES H. RAND telephonically
contacted the Cleveland Office and advised that he
had some information concerning the subject which he
felt would be of interest to this office. He stated
that he had just returned from Russia and New York
City and wished to give this information to the
Cleveland Office since he felt that it involved a
matter within our investigative jurisdiction and

one which should be looked into.

Mr. RAND was thereafter contacted at the Rand -
Development Corporation at which time he provided
information concerning the subject's defection.

This information had largely been furnished by

NICK GRAZIANO previously and the Bureau has been
furnished this informatbn in previous correspondence
in this matter.

RAND stated that he had learned that the subject

had initially applied for Soviet citizenship upon
his first arrival in the U.S.S.R. on June 10, 1959.
It was his understanding that the suljject initiated
the entire procedure and actually had some difficulty
in getting the Soviets to accept him. He originally
contacted a Soviet official at the Moscow Fair.

f
This official's name was SHISHKIN (Phonetic). _#

According to RAND, as soon as the Soviets decided to
process the subject, they obtained from him a very
detailed bibliography of his life in .the United States
which included previous. residences, employments, educa-
tion, military service and all other background infor-
