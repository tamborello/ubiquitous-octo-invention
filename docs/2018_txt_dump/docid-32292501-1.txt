CRIMINAL INDICTMENT #28247

U. S. VS. LASSOFF, EDLA, AR

The trial of this case is still delayed due to legal
motions pending in behalf of the defendants. The defense is
attempting to suppress evidence allegedly obtained as a result
of the Treasury Dept. monitoring the telephone of one of the
defendants, and by virtue of the efforts of the defense to chal-
lenge the petit jury. It is anticipated that the. trial will
begin the first week of December, 1962.
