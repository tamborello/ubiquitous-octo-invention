ye

Subject's father-in-law was born in Italy and entered the United
States in 1905. He was naturalized in 1920. He is deceased.

Subject's mother-in-law was born in Italy and derived citizenship
by marriage to his father-in-law prior to 1922,

Subject's stepfather-in-law was born in Italy and entered the United
States in 1908. He has not applied for U.S. citizenship. The records of the
Inmigration and Naturalization Service contained no derogatory information on
Subject's stepfather-in-law.

Subject lists two aunts and uncles on his Personal History State-
ment, who are Italian citizens residing in Italy.

A CE check was made on Subject and members of his family with nega-
tive results, and no informant questioned the loyalty of Subject, his mother-
in-law or stepfather-in-law.

2. Conclusion and Recommendation: In view of the highly favorable
information received relative to Subject's loyalty, there is no reason to
feel that he is in any way influenced by Reverend Pascale, a character ref-~
erence, who in 1948 supported the Civil Rights Congress. There is no indi-
cation that Subject has belonged to or supported the Civil Rights Congress
or any other questionable organization.

It is recommended that the exception to the exclusion clause,
Paragraph 2a, Administrative Instructions 10-2 requested in the attached
letter of justification, relative to Subject's stepfather-~in-law, who is
an Italian citizen residing in the United States, be granted and Subject be
security approved for CLASSIFIED duties.
