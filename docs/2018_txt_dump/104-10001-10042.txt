MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: °COMMO Logs on Transmittal Times of Cables kegt ely TO days: ©
Jnpessible Ye Pinel tranenitte| Time oF OUT
- eo. 2¢6?F jo OnV ec?
1. Mr. Echols of COMMO informed me on 23 March that
COMMO keeps logs of transmittal times for outgoing cables
and teletypes only ninety days. At the end of that time
they are destroyed. There is no point, he stated, in
trying to find the transmittal times of teletypes sent
in October 1963 as such logs have been destroyed by now.

.

2. It is,. therefore, impossible to find the trans-
mittal times of OUT Teletypes 74678 (10 October 1963).
Logs containing this information have been destroyed.
