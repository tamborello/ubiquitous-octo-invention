“NO.

‘Se Did he have a chance to debrief hin fully? Could he have
- done 80? i

‘It was not possible to debrief DIAZ fully for two reasons.

- His state of mind while being held in the INS offices in:
Miami was not conducive toa preper debriefing; and there
was not enough time to obtain requirements fron Headquarters.

. DIAZ was given a good prelininary debriefing by the FBI -

_ dmmediately after his arrival, and a thorough debriefing:

. was possible only under different circumstances and with!

~ detailed requirements. There was no denial by INS, other
than as the result of the circunstances, of access to DIAZ,

. who, theoretically could have been debriefed. j
