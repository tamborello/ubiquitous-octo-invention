Dear Jim,

Maurice DEJEAN

oe ee

It has recently come to our notice that DEJEAN's
secretary when he vas in Moscow was a certain Christine
DAVIRON, who in “63 in Moscow married an American journalist
described as BudVKORENGOLD currently Newsweek correspondent

- SS eS
in London. ea TE

2. KORENGOLD appears to be identical with R.dJ. KORENGOLD
who was in Moscow for Newsweek from 195 rebably until
1967 or 1968. We have not traced a the
only other trace we have of him is an ‘ticle he wrote
giving his impressions of being a correspondent in Moscow.
This was produced in "SURVEY", considered by our Soviet

experts to be a reliable publication in an anti-Communist
context.

36: The KORENGOLDs are unowl’ to amember of the FCO who was
in Moscow with them. This official says he has never

[noticed that she was biaised either for or against the Soviet
system. He describes her as coming from a rather strait-
laced military family. She is aged about 30, intelligent
and attractive. ;

4. We have not told the French about this but would be
quite happy for you to discuss it with them.

_, Yours sincerely,
REEL ae REL ETT ANNE RTF bat Sct
