PG 92-216

PG 509-C advised on 6/5/58 that the Barbout game run at Triangle
Billiards will resume in about a week but the craps game.is to be
moved to a new location, not yet selected.

SAM MANNARINO, who recently suffered serious stroke and was
reportedly near death, was reported by Mercy Hospital, Pittsburgh,
where confined, on 6/4/58 to be making a satisfactory recovery.

  

Discussion has been had with INS, Pittsburgh, as to possibility

their calling an immediate hearing on LA ROCCA's petition for
citizenship, thus forcing him to appear and presenting

opportunity for USM to serve outstanding subpoena, which service

would provide basis for INS to move for postponement or rejection
of the petition. :
