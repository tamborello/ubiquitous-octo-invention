ReBuairtel 11/26/63.

Information set out in Detroit LHM dated 11/22/63 was made
available at Detroit on 11/21/63 by Department Attorney

William French in the form of an undated blind memorandum
which he said was dictated by Robert C. Meissner on 11/19/63
concerning a meeting with Joseph F. Verhelle on 11/18/63, ,.

Mr. French requested that the information be summarized in
the same manner as in three previous letterhead memoranda
(dated 11/7,8,and 12/63) containing information from the
same source. Mr. French had previously requested that
Meissner's identity be concealed because of the confidential
basis upon which the information had been furnished to him

by Meissner and the sensitive nature of the matter in which

the Department was seeking Meissner's cooperation, particularly
the possibility of an attempt to influence the judge or jury
‘in the forthcoming trial of James R. Hoffa at Chicago.

 

Mr. French advised that on 11/22/63 Meissner would be in
telephonic contact with French or Department Attorney Thomas
McKeon at Detroit, and it would be known whether Verhelle
i had confirmed arrangements to meet Meissner in Chicago on
11/25/63. Mr. French left Detroit before there was any further
discussion with him concerning the proposed LHM. Mr. McKeon
advised on 11/22/63 that no further word had been received
by him from Meissner regarding. the proposed: meeting with
- Verhelle on 11/25/63. The LHM was submitted on the basis of
Mr. French's remarks on 11/21/63.

Inasmuch as the Bureau has advised in reairtel

that the LHM will be disseminated only to the Criminal
Division of. the Department, there is no known reason for
_Meissner's identity to be concealed, other than Mr. French's
original request, as mentioned above, Mr. French probably
' will not be available at Detroit for further discussion of

submitted

 

 

 

this point prior to next week, If the Bureau desires to
withhold dissemination of the LHM until that time, it will
be determined from him whether there is any objection at
this time to disclosing Meissner's identity in the LHM, and
if there is no objection by him, an amended LHM will be

immediately. Otherwise it ishkelieved the LHM

could be disseminated in its present form.
