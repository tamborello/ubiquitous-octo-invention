ordinary. You see in this case it was not a routine matter,
for he wanted to expedite the process.

After you had a conversation with Oswald, or when you had

the conversation, would you point on the drawing to where you
were standing? .

Certainly. I would be here and he would be there.

Would you tell me where the phones are in each’ of fice?
Certainly. There was a telephone in this office, the secre-
tary's office, at this spot and also a telephone in my office
at this spot. I also had an intercom, but I did not normally
use the intercom. I came out through ‘this door and I asked him
to get out at this point, while we were standing here. I

told him to get out now.

Would it have been possible for him to have used your tele-
phone?

No. You see normally if somebody asks whether they can use
our phone, we say sure, go ahead. But I remember that he did
not ask me whether he could use our phone.

To your knowledge, did anyone else in your office, Mrs. Duran,
(permit) Oswald to make a phone call from your Consulate?

It could have happened, yes. But there was no reason. If

she wanted to authorize a phone call she could do it, but there
was no reason to.

Did you ever have any conversations with her, in which she
indicated that she could have done it?

No. Never. I met her again two years after the assassination,

in November of 1965, and she was a very good friend of mine.

Did you discuss this?

ves, of course. She told me about all her problems with the
Mexican authorities. They had arrested her, they had put

her picture’ on the front pages of the newspapers, that there
was a tremendous scandal, you know, involving her.

Did she discuss with you the confrontation that she had with
Oswald?

Of course. The same thing that happened to me. It had only
been two years, and we remembered perfectly well. You see,

the Mexican authorities wanted to implicate her, for you see,
since she was Mexican, even though she was Mexican she had no
diplomatic privileges, and you see, they arrested her and -they
wanted to implicate her and they even treated her very badly.
She defended herself though. She bit people and she kicked
people and it was a very, very public thing, you know. A
public scandal in the newspapers. They tried to coerce her.
In those discussions that you had with her then, did she say
anything about her memory in reference to the person who was
there, as opposed to the person that she saw on TV?

I really do not remember if + we discussed that. It's very
likely that I spoke about that. I really do not remember it,
because more than anything our conversation consisted of Mrs.
Duran telling me about her problems with the Mexican authorities.
Were all of the man's visits, whoever he was, during the normal

working hours? You know, from 10 to 2?

B: Mr. Azcue, may I ask that when you refer to the drawing, that
you may recall that you are being recorded, that you speak
in such a way that someone who is hearing the recording may
be able to follow what you are saying.

A: Fine. The entrance is in a corner between two streets. It
is a large broad entrance, and we have a hall immediately
following the entrance, which is the waiting room for visitors.
The second part would be the consulate where the secretary
would be sitting. There is a wall there made of wood and
glass, the lower section made of wood, and the top section
made of glass. . “that's the wall that the secretary would
be looking into the waiting room and outside into the street,
from where she sat. The secretary would be sitting at this
point in the middle. Now around her-would be furniture and
desks. The secretary can see the entrance. She is in the
proper position and that whole wall is made of glass, and
everyone who comes, you. know, she can see whether they. are
coming in alone or whether they are coming in accompanied.
She receives the company at this spot here. The person would
normally come in and say that they have come to apply for a
visa, and then she brings the person in to this spot. If there
is any problem, she would call me, and I would come out of my
office.

.

B: Would she call you personally, or would she call you on the
@ phone ?
A: No, no. She would call me personally. We are very close.
She would probably get up and call me, however, if itcis a.matter

that is not routine; something that is different from the

B: Do. you speak Russian?

A: No.

B: Did anybody in the office at that time speak Russian?

A: No.

B: Then no. member of the Cuban Consulate in 1963 spoke Russian?

A: That is correct., Nowdays probably many Cubans speak Russian.

B: Did you have any telephones at the Embassy that could be used
by the public?

A: No. The only telephones that could be used were those in our
offices.

B: Could you describe to us the route that Oswald would have had
to have taken to get into your office?

A: If you want I will draw a schematic plan for you.

B: Do it right here.

(By right here, Professor Blakey means on one of the back
pages of the questionnaire that was presented to the Cuban
government, in copy number 4.)

B: For the record, we will stop for about two minutes, while Mr.
Azcue makes the drawing. We are back on the record. .Mr.
Azcue has prepared a drawing. Will you explain it to us,
please, Mr. Azcue?

A: This is the entrance.

B: He is pointing to the right hand side of the drawing.

A: These are the streets.

e@ B: Could you tell us some names of the streets, please?

A: The one on the right is Francisco Marcos Street. The other

one I cannot recall right now.

I do not believe the commander could have said such a thing.

I mean there was no motive to say that, because this all
occurred before the assassination of Kennedy. It was a
routine application, and Oswald only had to deal with me,
nobody else.

Perhaps I mis-conveyed the information. The journalist is not
indicating that Premier Castro, himself, overheard this. The
journalist is indicating that these words are attributed to
Mr. Oswald were heard by whomever dealt with Oswald in Mexico.
Oh! I'm sorry. Well, I don't think Oswald said that. That's
ridiculous. A person who has the mission to assassinate the
President would not publicize it. That is ridiculous.

Then you did not overhear him say this?

No. Never.

Then the words that are reported here were not overheard by
you?’

He never presented himself as having anything to offer.

Did the person who appeared at the Embassy say anything like
this?

Never. That I would remember quite well. For that would have
been of importance if he wanted to work with us. I would have
sent the information to Cuba. And, as you know, that does not
appear in the information I sent them. I would have registered
that, that he wanted to work for us. That all happened in
September. I would have listed it on the application, "This

person wants to work for us".
