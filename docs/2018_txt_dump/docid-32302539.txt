on. 6/8/61, PG 615-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH III:

Within the past ten days THOMAS ANTHONY "SONNY" CIANCUTTI
has opened a travel agency on Fourth Avenue, New Kensington,
Pa. The name is something like Holiday Travel Agency :
put its exact name and address will be obtained. In
informant's opinion, this agency creation was undoubtedly
decided upon by the MANNARINOs, since "SONNY" CIANCUTTI

is one of their newest trusted lieutenants.

 

Pittsburgh will develop more complete information regarding
the above travel agency.

TH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
