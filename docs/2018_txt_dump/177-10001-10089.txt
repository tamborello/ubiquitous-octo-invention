MEMORANDUM FOR MR, BUNDY

SUBJECT: Miscellaneous

   

  

Dillon Committee = Reminder - You indicated that you might want to talk
on about the possibility of putting the necessary money for the
Secret Service into the Budget without checking back with the President. It
would probably be a good idea to talk to Gordon soon since I understand that
the Budget will be closed for printing in the very near future. Gordon's office
tells me that he will be back in Washington on Thursday.

If we don't take this route, then it means that somebody will have to get hold
of the President and get his explicit approval before we run out of time.

2. My Christmas Plans - I plan to spend Christmas with my in-laws in New
Jersey this weekend and to be back in Washington on Monday night. I will be
reachable on 609-882-3987,

3. British Guiana - Bill Cobb gave me a few high-lights of the recent US/UK
meeting in London, First, Greenwood is still thinking that a rapprochement
between Jagan and Burnham would be a good thing. However, he does not yet

seem to be prepared to do anything about it. Second, the British Ministers
are not sure they like us to be in the

   
   
 
   

The British are
presently in the process of reviewing their policy on BG to see whether they
want to continue things as they are or whether they want to see some changes;
presumably, the question will be covered in this general review. Mean-
while - business as usual. Third, the British don't want us to talk to Burnham
about economic aid before they have had a chance to talk to the Governor. . We
expect to hear from the British in a week or two on this question, and do not
expect any trouble; they seem to like our economic program,

Bill said the talks, on the whole and as usual, were forthright and friendly,
