RE: GABRIEDL’MANNARINO, aka .
AR

 

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka
AR

By airtel 4/7/61, Miami advised that spot checks of the LOUIS
’ VOLPE residence, 12850 Maple Rd., Keystone Point, North Miami,
Fla., were unproductive and subject GABRIEL MANNARINO not
observed.

  
 
 
 
 
  
 
    
 
  
   
  
  

 

Same airtel set out that only vehicle observed at GABRIEL
MANNARINO's house at 8919 Dickens Ave., Surfside, Fla., was
1960 Oldsmobile station wagon, Florida license 1W9966, registered
to BETTY AMATO. It is noted that BETTY AMATO is the wife of
FRANK D. AMATO, GABRIEL MANNARINO's brother-in-law.

on 4/7/61, PCI JIM KELLY, New Kensington, Pa., advised SA THOMA
G. FORSYTH III, as follows: .

Within the past two weeks, the MANNARINO controlled horse-room
which had ben located on the second floor at 937 Barnes St.,
New Kensington, was moved to the basement of the Garibaldi
0 Bldg., Fifth Ave., at 12th St., New Kensington. This means
that this location operates as a horse-room by day and as a f
\ barbout-craps gambling casino by night.

UNRECORE®:

fa
on 4/7,10/61, CIs and PCIs familiar with the MANNARINO activitids

in New Kensington, Pa., were given the assignment of finding out
if the MANNARINOs use a wire service in t wa 9] room and the
om thereof. . «48, REC- 60 14 - —//2 .
