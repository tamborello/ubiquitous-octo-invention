information he might have about Mafia activities.

PG T-~1 stated that during the Prohibition Years he had a
close association with the Italian criminal element in
Monongahela, Pa., and vicinity, and that the terms Mafia

and "Black Hand” were used frequently. He explained that
any time a crime was committed peopkéewould refer to the
Mafia as being responsible for the crime. He said that he
did not doubt but what the Mafia did exist in the past
because as previously mentioned his father-in-law, deceased,
received a threatening letter from the "Black Hand," He
said he does not believe the Mafia exists today because

the leaders of the Italian criminal element of the early
1930's have matured, become wiser aig, hose who were
probably Mafla members went into ‘ham J, Bypes of successful
businesses and as a result it was mm : deiger necessary for
them to have close ties and use ‘shysigaél, violence to make

a livelihood. He added that he felt that the development of
better law enforcement agencies and better and more honest
politicians has had something to do with the discontinuance
of the Mafia. He again. stated that he had no specific knowledge
regarding the activities of the Mafia and did not know of any
given person who was a member of such a group.

  

On May 6, 1959, PG T-2, who has furnished reliable information
in the past, furnished the following information.

PG T-2 stated that he has lived all of his life in the
vicinity of Monongahela, Pa., and when 10 to 15 years of age
he remembered his parents, aunts and uncles often referred to
the "Black Hand" and Mafia. He said that when a major crime
was. committed the “old Italian people" would say, "it was
-done by the 'Black Hand.'" He further advised that he has
no knowledge of any. person who was a member of the Mafia and
does not believe that such an organization exists in
Monongahela or vicinity at the present time. He stated that
he recalled many years ago that his uncle of Gallatin, Pa.,
who died in 1953, received a letter from the “Black Hand" —
which threatened to kidnap his daughter if he did not make
certain payments. PG T-2 explained that his uncle was a
