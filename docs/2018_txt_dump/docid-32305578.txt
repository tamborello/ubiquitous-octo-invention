"HELEN" is probably HELEW GRECO, widow of "SPIKE"

JONES, the musician, Miss BETSY DUNCAN, former PCI, advised
that HELEN GRECO is a very respectable person who was married
to JONES for nearly twenty years. She has a home in the
Trousdale Estates in Beverly Hills, an area of very expensive
homes. DUNCAN said that she has heard that. GRECO and ROSELLI
are going-to get married in October, 1965: that GRECO is
going to sell her home and they are going to buy a lot and
build a home of their own, DUNCAN then said that she does
not believe that GRECO will marry ROSELLI; that GRECO is aware
of ROSELLI's background and that she thinks GRECO has more
commgn sense than to marry ROSELLI. .

 

DIANE PALEY, former Bookkeeper for automatio shine
Company, Incorporated, was interviewed on 8/4/65. Shé recalls
when she first went to work for this company in January, 1965,
phat. on one oceasion ROSELLI came to the office with EMANUEL. -
ROTHMAN, who was one of the directors of the company. She said
that this is the only time she has seen ROSELLI. She saia@ oF
_that itis her opinion, through her work at this coppany,for Cl
about three months, that ROSELLI does not have, orfaid not have-—
an interest in the company. She said that ALBERT/BRODKIN, who
‘was the president, was an extremely poor businessman and some-
thing of a "con" man; that he never paid any bills unless
forced to and was working all of the time on borrowed money 3
that he was a man of: little principle who would lie whenever
it suited his interests and that he did not seem to have
‘sufficient ability to successfully manage a business. :

Examination of the bank account, "EMANUEL ROTHMAN,

Trustee", at the Union Bank, Los Angeles, which account has
been used extensively in the past to handle financial trans-
actions of ROSELLI, reflects that on 7/2/65 a check for .$2,500
was paid to MAURICE FRIEDMAN. A notation of the facé of the
check set out' Repayment of one half of principal balance of
5/3/65 loan." The check was deposited to some account at the

. Fidelity Bank, Mar Vista, California. Contact with this
bank failed to reflect that FRIEDMAN has an account at this
bank. Efforts are being made to trace the account to which

' the check was deposited, :
