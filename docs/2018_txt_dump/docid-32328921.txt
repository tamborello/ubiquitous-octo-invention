learned that despite the setback caused by REYES, meet~
ings were still being held, although no activity was
permitted for security reasons. He said that at the time
he left, the organization was inactive.

DEL CASTILLO stated he had vecelwed a letter from
@ friend im the 30ch of November Movement in Cuba, about
3 weeks ago, which indicated that efforts to reorganize
~the movement were proceeding.

 

 

DEL CASTILLO advised that the principal diffi-
culties encountered by the underground, during the last
few months of his activity, were those imposed by the
vigilance coumittees im each block which made it impossible
to meet, and therefore impossible to plam. He said that
every movement is viewed with suspicion and t it was
only because of hie position as a physician than he was
able to operate as a coordinator in the Professional
Section. He stated, however, that he was survellled from
time to time, and was frequently asked to explain how he
had spent certain periods ‘of time.

 

 

DEL CASTILLO also mentioned that another serious
problem for the underground was that of Finances. As an
example, he pointed out that certain people whe devoted
their entire activity to underground work had to be
supported by the underground. “He recalled that during the
year and a half he was in the 36th of November Movement, the
group lost im ome fashion or another, 82 automobiles. He
said that automobiles were vital to the @ffective operation
of the underground im the cities. ; ,

 

DEL CASTELLO stated that fear and the threat of
infiltration by CASTRO agents had seriously paralyzed the
activities of the underground organizations, including the
30th of November Movement in Cuba. :

being composed of individuals living in proximity to

each other. Each of the 4 groups was subdivided into
areas of operation, such as action and sabotage,

finance, propaganda, supply and military. DEL

CASTILLO stated that the action and sabotage groups were
usually caught, and it was seldom that an individual could
remain in this activity more than 3 or 4 months.

At the time that he was active, the finance group °.
was charged with the responsibility of obtaining funds,
which was usually accomplished by the sale of bonds to
members or sympathizers, The propaganda activity, which
was handled on a cell basis, consisted mainly of the dis-
tribution of mimeographed sheets exposing the Communist
nature of the CASTRO government.

He stated that the supply activity was almost
nil in the last months of his activity, since there were
no supplies,

He stated that the military group consisted of
those designated to go to the hills and mountains, but
that very Tittle activity of such a nature actually took
place, due to the lack of resources,

He stated that the Workers, Students and Professional
Sections were well organized and that the 30th of November
Movement had groups in all 33 of the Labor confederations
of Cuba,

DEL CASTILLO stated that prior to the invasion
of April 17, 1961 by anti-CASTRO forces, the 30th of
November Movement in Cuba was very well organized in-all
Provinces. In addition, prior to April 17, 1961, alliances
with other underground organizations had been made,

ground movement suffered a Severe setback following the (
unsuccessful invasion of April 17, 1961. As a result
of mass arrests which followed the invasion, the 30th
of November Movement wag serLously disorganized, and
there followed a period of almost total inactivity.

DEL CASTILLO stated that the movement was re-
covering its strength and reorganizing during the summer
and fall of 1961. “At this time, however, there were
several arrests made by the CASTRO government, including
the arrest of the General Coordinator of the Movimiento
Revolucionario del Pueblo CMRP), described by DEL
CASTILLO as probably the strongest. of the under ground
organizations. He stated that following the arrest of REYNOL
GONZALEZ, the MRP disintegrated and as of the time he ;
left Cuba in December, 1961, it was of no consequence,

of the 30th of November Movement, including all of the
leadership of the Student Section, and consequently

many leaders and members of the 30th of November Move-
Inent were arrested. Others were able to escape to

asylum in some of the Embassies in Havana, but the acti-
vities of the organization were almost eliminated. DEL
CASTILLO stated that at the time this happened, he himself
