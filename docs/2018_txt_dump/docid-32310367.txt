. Say
Informant advised that he was always close to KAVNER,

 

and even-though the, Teamsters..did not -get. the -SCHEIB-contract —--°""

until after informant ‘left the Teamsters, KAVNER got in touch

~,~" “with him and discussed the situation. Informant knows that ™ ~~~"

at the time of the transfer KAVNER was spending a lot of time i
: with SCHEIB, and after KAVNER and SCHEIB returned from '
San Francisco KAVNER had several meetings with DORIA. a

| ; Informant stated that he knows for a fact that |
at about the time of the transfer KAVNER came up with }
: some money as at that time KAVNER paid off a loan KAVNER
had at the Erie Bank, Erie, Colorado. Informant related that
in about December, 1960, KAVNER came to him and said he needed |
| $10,000. in a hurry and asked the informant's assistance in
: helping him obtain a loan. . KAVNER was introduced to PHIL }
| MATTHEW, who was then Executive Vice President of Empire
\ Financial Corporation, Van Nuys, California. MATTHEW told
: KAVNER that if KAVNER had collateral he could arrange a loan
‘ for KAVNER at the Erie Bank, Erie, Colorado, which is owned
: by Empire. KAVNER wanted to obtain a loan just on the strength
of his signature and the signature of the informant as co-signer, |
- but MATTHEW would not make a loan on that basis. KAVNER
then said he could put up stock as collateral, which MATTHEW
accepted, and the loan was made. Informant noted that at |
_the time he asked KAVNER if he had the stock why he did. not
sell the stock and obtain the money instead of getting the loan,
to which KAVNER replied that the stock actually belonged to
a truck operator who was just signing the stock over to KAVNER
as a favor to assist KAVNER in obtaining the loan.

 

 

Informant noted that this was a six months loan,
and at about the time KAVNER closed the SCHEIB deal KAVNER
i had the money to pay off the loan. . ;

Informant noted that KAVNER is shrewd and probably
got the money to pay off this loan through a mortgage on his
house or another loan and is probably paying off the indebtedness
incurred in this latter financing with the money he obtained
out of the SCHEIB deal. He noted that this point should be
i borne in mind if. KAVNER's payment of the Erie Bank loan is
checked out. .
