It is noted the indices of the Seattle Office |
contain no derogatory information identifiable with STEVENS.
i; During the. course of the interview with STEVENS he made
i #7) several references to the tour which he made.of many countries
i in Africa after leaving Moscow. In connection with this
io, he referred to the way some South African nations are
i handling their "nigger problem" and said eur country should }
i ff; learn a few things from them and get away from the current
hilosophy in which we are taking many rights away from
white people and giving them to the black people who have
no basic wight to intrude on the private, lives of white
people. Mr. JONES said he feels very strongly on this
' ' matter and it was noted that he appeared to be very loud
and outspoken. This is pointed out as of possible interest
' in the event future consideration should ever be given to
using him as a witness.
that Washington Field Office letter dated October 10, 1963,
said that Mr. McDANIEL described STEVENS as "an honest,
loyal American, but one who could be described as an ‘Ugly
American'!, in that he did not like Russia, Russians or
anything about them and let them know it at every opportunity.
