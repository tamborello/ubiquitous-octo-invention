also been reported, but the evidence is unclear as to quantities shipped
and the extent of Cuba's role in thesé transactions. We believe that
there is an extensive agent net in Latin America directed from Havana.

6. Castro has associated himself with revolutionary activist groups
throughout Latin America. In most cases these have been Communist,
but where the regular Communist Party favored a legal or parliamen-
tary line-he has not hesitated ‘to support dissident Communist groups,
e.g., in Brazil, and non-Communist revolutionaries, e.g., in Guatemala
and El Salvador. In some ‘cases he has sponsored new revolutionary
organizations, e.g., in Panama, Colombia, and Peru. In Chile he has
endorsed a popular front coalition made up of Communist and moderate
leftists. : : :

.

Evaluation

7. Instances of financial and material support sent by Cuba to revolu-
tionaries in other countries which have come to our attention are
probably only a part of the total effort. Even so, the effort seems to
have been relatively small and ineffective. Yet along with the political
and psychological stimulus which Castro’s influence has provided, Cuban
subversive activities have perceptibly strengthened activist revolutionary °
groups. Dangerous situations subject to exploitation by Castro and
‘the Communists exist in a number of Latin American countries—
notably Venezuela, Brazil, British Guiana, the Dominican Republic, and
Bolivia, These dangers arise from political and social tensions which
existed long before Castro came to power. They might lie dormant
for some time; but with Castro as a potential detonator, they are more
likely to blow up. The detonative compound will exist as long as Cas-

- troism survives, whatever may happen to Castro personally. -

8. The most dangerous aspect of Castroism has been its broad appeal
as a symbol of revolutionary change and nationalist assertiveness in
Latin America. Propaganda from Cuba has taken advantage of this
fact and has almost certainly been a more important influence in the
Latin American situation than Castro’s other subversive activities.
During 1960 and 1961 Castroism became a ‘force to be reckoned with
politically in a number of Latin American countries. Certain govern-

~ ments felt obliged to move in the direction of. neutralist and leftist posi-

tions, This influence waned, however, after Castro identified himself
with the Bloc in late 1961. Nevertheless, the. appeal to Castro’s move-
ment continued to be a source of major concern to almost. all govern-
ments and seriously restricted their willingness to associate themselves,
at least publicly, with the US. : se :

I, CASTRO’S SUBVERSIVE POTENTIAL IN THE AFTERMATH OF AN
AGREEMENT: UNDER WHICH THE SOVIETS WOULD WITHDRAW

THEIR STRATEGIC MISSILES AND THE US GIVE ASSURANCES THAT

IT WOULD NOT INVADE CUBA

“9 Gastro's subversive capabilities—and his disposition to.use them—

will be enhanced by the sense of security provided by such sophisticated
weapons as are retained in Cuba after the withdrawal of, Soviet strategic
missiles, The IL-28 bombers, if retained, and other modern equipment
noted in Annex B; would be important in this regard. A US commit-
ment not to invade Cuba will further strengthen his sense of immunity
from reprisal and almost certainly encourage him to intensify subver-
sive activities in other Latin American countries.

Response of Castro Supporters to Missile Base Crisis

10. Castro’s supporters throughout Latin America, with few though
important exceptions (e.g., sabotage of oil facilities in Venezuela), failed
to respond to the missile base crisis with effective acts of sabotage or
with impressive public demonstrations. Two important limiting factors

should be taken into account in judging this response, however. US.

action to alert Latin American governments led them to make extensive
advance preparation, including deployment of security forces and the
roundup of suspects, a condition’ of readiness which is unlikely to be
maintained indefinitely. There also. may have been some uncertainty
among the activist followers of Castro whether they should make their
big effort in response to the announcement of the US blockade, or wait
for the anticipated US invasion. ' Moscow’s apparent failure to provide
guidance may have contributed to the confusion. It is our judgment,

however, that the response to Castro’s appeal for attacks on the US.
and its friends indicates that his power to command revolutionary —
action, at least in the circumstances of the missile base crisis, is limited,

Support Which Castro Can Expect in the Future

11, The range of Castro’s support has been, we believe, considerably
narrowed by events since Castro declared himself a Communist.” Rev-
elation of the fact that he had allowed the Soviets to establish offensive
bases under exclusive Soviet control has alienated many non-Communist
nationalists, genuine neutralists, and even revolutionaries seeking social
and economic betterment. San Tiago Dantas, formerly Foreign Min-
ister under President Goulart and an author of Brazil’s nonalignment

policy, and leading Mexican officials have publicly expressed their -

disenchantment, .

12, The activist revolutionaries are probably the only important force*

on which Castro can“now count, but even their support has apparently

. been rendered less effective by differences on the question of Soviet rela-

tions with Castro and with Latin American Communist parties.

THE ESTIMATE
“1. CASTRO’S SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES BEFORE THE MISSILE BASE CRISIS *

' Aims

 

1. From the time of his accession to power Fidel Castro has sought to
gain acceptance of the Cuban revolution as a model for others and of |
‘himself as the leader of revolutionary forces throughout Latin America.
: . He has constantly sought to foment revolutions in other Latin American .
moe States. Moreover, Castro has generally had the support of the Sino-
; Soviet Bloc in the pursuit of these aims.

.

Means

2. Castro began. his career of sponsorship for revolutions in Latin
America in 1959 with landings of small rebel forces in Nicaragua, Pan-.
ama, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. None of these were successful

' and he turned to other means.

3. From the beginning, propaganda has been | one of the principal in-
struments on which Castro has relied. In addition to the main trans-
' missions of Radio Havana for external listeners, which have had a great
’.. deal of revolutionary content, he has beamed special programs devised
to stimulate revolutionary action to each of half a dozen selected
- countries.2. A major effort has been made through Prensa Latina, the
Cuban news service, to disseminate Castro-Communist propaganda.
“Printed propaganda has also been sent from Cuba into most other
Latin American States, ‘and Cuban diplomatic missions and personnel ~
. have actively ‘disseminated it. Students returning from indoctrination
in Cuba have helped establish Cuban Institutes for Friendship among

- Peoples which have functioned as propaganda outlets.

 

4, Thousands of Latin: Americans have been brought to Cuba; about
1,200 foreign trainees are believed to be there now. Many hundreds
have been trained in revolutionary techniques and guerrilla warfare.
Cuba has been made a main transit point for travel between Latin
America and the Bloc. aT

5. Financial support has s been? provided. by. Cuba to revolutionary

groups in a number of-couiitries, although the cases on which we have
reports involved~ -rélatively small sums of money. Arms shipments have

for subversive actions throughout Latin America. The extent
to which this potential is realized will depend upon the situation

_in Cuba, Soviet policy toward Cuba, and the policies and perform-

' otage, and the Soviets are likely to assist. Castro in reaching thern-.

ance of the other Latin American governments and.ot.
respect to the Castro threat... There are many targets t

  

for action overseas. As in the period before the missile base
crisis, the effect of Castro’s subversive activities will depend not
only upon his capabilities but upon the attractiveness of the
Cuban example and the willingness of the American governments
to.take determined counteraction. This willingness will probably
be weakened by fulfillment of the US commitment not to invade
Cuba. . : ,

C. We have examined how Castro’s subversive potential would
be affected by alternative courses of Soviet policy regarding Cuba:
(1) virtual withdrawal of support; (2) continuation of economic

tially
increased levels. We believe that course (1) would. considerably
reduce Castro’s subversive potential, and that the Soviets are
unlikely to elect it. We conclude that Soviet course (2) would

 
 

’ maintain Castro’s potential for subversive action at least.at pres;

ent levels or actually raise it to the point where he could under-
take amphibious and/or airborne subversive operations against

close-in targets. -.-

CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE
CAPABILITIES IN LATIN
AMERICA

THE PROBLEM . ce

To describe and evaluate Castro’s capabilities, with Soviet ‘elp,
for carrying out subversion and sabotage in Latin America. after
satisfaction of all US conditions relative to the withdrawal of
strategic weapons systems from Cuba and a consequent US com-
mitment not to invade.

NOTE: In this estimate we have considered Castro’s raw capabilities,

' taking note of, but not working out in detail, US and Latin
American capabilities for counteraction.

SUMMARY

A. The dangerously unstable situation that prevails through-
out much-of Latin America is the product of fundamental’ in-

* equities and historic circumstances; it is not the creation of °

Castro and the Soviets. Castro’s efforts, with Soviet help. to
exploit this situation by means of subversion and sabotage: have
not produced significant, results. Propaganda exploitati
Castro and Cuba as symbols of revolution has probably beer: more
effective. to date than other subversive activities. Castres” in-
fiuence in Latin America had waned by the time of the missile
base crisis and was further reduced by the revelation that he

  
  

-. had accepted Soviet strategic missile bases on Cuban soil and
‘py the manner of the Soviet decision to withdraw them.

B. Implementation of an agreement between the US anc. the
USSR whereby the strategic weapons systems would be with-
drawn and the US committed not to intervene in Cuba with force
will leave Castro with a new immunity and a greater freedom
