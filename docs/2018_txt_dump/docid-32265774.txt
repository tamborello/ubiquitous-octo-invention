sixth floor window was level with our fifth floor window") and
she saw a white male, wearing a hat, apparently looking for
something among boxes. She showed the man to her co-worker,
Gertrude Fowler, and a few minutes later they all went to have
lunch and watch the President's motorcade.

When the motorcade came by, Mrs. Hall states she heard
a bang; the President's.hands went.up towards his head, and
a cop fell off his motorcycle. Another bang and the President's
head went over. Jackie got out of the car onto the trunk; everyone
was screaming and running. "I thought I saw smoke coming from
the railroad. A lot of people ran to the railroad tracks,
including myself, but we turned around and went back to work.
At the factory there were plainclothes police. I told Mr.
Leads about the man in the window across the street when I
heard someone say that the shots had come from the T.S.B.D.
Mr. Leadstold me to talk to the police and tell them what I

saw, which I did. Later we were all sent home."
