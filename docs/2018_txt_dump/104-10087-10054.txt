a. Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official a ial papers; it will therefore take
place under the Supervision of 4: ficer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier. bei Gr to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 Golan Shes e purgee Qf the following:

1. ivrRODUCTIN

. ‘The 201 system oat os identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations D)re' we and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories..Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

   

2. THE 201 SYSTEM
The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying fi ar for reporting on that

    

refer Sy the individual, ie, per-

  

sonal history, curren S\N
c. The Master 201 Receged a generated by the opening of
a 201 file. This record produky Ster 201 reference for the Main Index and

stores the pertinent informatio which may later be retrieved! for special listings.
d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref.
erence consolidated.

A 201] personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
‘when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment. : :

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service.
