; 1. Attached is 3 newspaper interview with Anerican
Black Power advocate Dale SMITH, whick was published in |
Sdndags Aktuelt, 7 July 1968, and which gives a fair dese
Syiption o? SdTPH’s views as they have been expressed on
other oecasions. — :

2. SMITH mentions a television program waich had been
filmed but not shown by Danish TV. The program was, in fact,
‘shown on the week the interview appeared; the title was “The
Negro in Denmark’ and a group of five American Negroes had a
fine time sitting around a table in a dark, smoke-fiiled sat
meant to appear as 2 cafe, damning white America , capitalism,
Russian communism, and - most emphatically ~ Denmark, all
with a fine disdain for logie or sequence of thoughs.
