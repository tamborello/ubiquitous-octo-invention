Little Rock file 92-124, pertaining to Top
Hoodlum Program, relfects that on August 15, 1958, file.
was opened pertaining to FINLEY. This file indicates that
FINLEY uses no "scratch" information but bases his odds
on the racing form and pays.a limit of. $32. to. win, $14 to
show and $8 to.place on a $2 bet. These -eddsjare very high,
as of January 30, 1963, but were brought. about. by
competitors in that betting was very slow since Federal
Legislation had been enacted. , There was no indication of
a Federal violation on the part of FINLEY, . who operated as
a bookie during the racing meet at Oaklawn Track, Hot
Springs, Arkansas; . . :

On May .7, 1963, FINLEY ‘advised an informant he
was ceasing his bookmak ing operations and did not plan
to secure anymore racing forms.

On August 23, 1963, informant advised, that
within the last few days,. Little Rock bookmaker BOB BRYANT
had stated that FINLEY had.currently engaged in the bookmak ing
business in the area of the Pulaski-Saline County line .on
U.S. Highway 67, southwest of. Little Rock, Arkansas, and
specifically operated at-the Red Gate Liquor Store, ‘Lela ' s
Restaurant, and at an unknown place in Benton, Arkansas.

i RAYMOND KYZER advised informant that FINLEY's
bookkeeper, NELL, and longtime girlfriend, had recently
left FINLEY and was married to some wine: KYZER commented
to informant that FINLEY had. almost lost his™ mind-as a result
of NELL's marriage.
