SUBJECT:: GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka.
SANE MANNARINO

gh On 5/29/61, PCL JAMES W. BURGART, New Kensington, Pa., advised

SA THOMAS Ga FORSYTH III:

The MANNARINO controlled horse-room on the sécond floor at
1195-5th Avenue, New Kensington, receives results from
Weirton, W. Va. They have a direct wire to a store in that
town which is ostensibly a television repair shop but is
actually a race result relay station. The direct wire has
an Edison (New Kensington) exchange and is very expensive.
Although it is generally known that this horse-room is a —
MANNARINO operation, it is difficult to say who fronts it for.
them, because personnel changes are fairly frequent. An =
attempt will be made to learn the Edison telephone number
used in Weirton and the identity of the individual to whom
it is billed, believed to be ANDY MANGINI, who holds a,
Federal Wagering Tax Stamp.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS
