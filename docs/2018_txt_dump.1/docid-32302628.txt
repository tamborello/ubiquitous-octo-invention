On 4/23/64 BETSY DUNCAN, PCI, who is currently
appearing as a singer-entertainer at Dino's, a night club
on the Sunset Strip, advised that since she has been at
Dino's for the past nine weeks, ROSSELLI has been there about
three times. The last occasion was on Friday, 4/17/64, when
ROSSELLI came there for dinner with a red-haired girl friend.
ROSSELLI introduced the girl to DUNCAN as "KATHY" and gave
no last name. DUNCAN said she does not know the girl and does
not know her last name,

DUNCAN further advised that ROSSELLI has recently
been gdaing with a woman named DOROTHY TOWNE, a former wife of
JACK WEBB, the TV and motion picture actor. It was DUNCAN's
understanding that TOWNE, who is an interior decorator, was
the person who decorated ROSSELLI's new apartment. —

DUNCAN mentioned to ROSSELLI that she would finish
her engagement at Dino's in about three weeks. ROSSELLI
suggested that she get in touch with BOB ABRAMS or BERNIE RICH
as they could probably get her an engagement at some hotel in
Las Vegas. She said ABRAMS amd RICH operate a talent agency
and formerly handled EDDIE FISHER, well-known singer. DUNCAN
said she told ROSSELLI that she did not need their help to get
work in Las Vegas. She did not know if ROSSELLI has any interest
in the talent agency of ABRAMS and RICH, This talent agency is
no doubt Selena Enterprises, Inc., mentioned peviously in this
investigation, for whom ROSSELLI obtained free office space for
several weeks at 8490 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California.

On 4/22/64 LA 4448-c-TE advised that in the 1920's,
when ROSSELLI first came to Los Angeles, he engaged in bootlegging
and also in hi-jacking liquor trucks of JACK I, DRAGNA, who
prior to his death in 1956 was reliably reported to head the
criminal syndicate in the Los Angeles area. Informant stated
that ROSSELLI's closest friend during the 1920's was one
JOHNNY BURNS, who was associated with ROSSELLI in bootlegging
and hi-jacking operations. He said subsequently ROSSELLI and
DRAGNA patched up their differences and became close associates.
Informant further advised that BURNS currently lives in the
Los Angeles area and is about seventy-five years of age.

Efforts will be made to locate BURNS so he may be interviewed.
