\ ances REPRODUCTION PRONIBITER

From the time. the Mexico Station was opened {in April 1947 un neil

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of. Station(Cin 7955) the Station had

 

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile surveillance team “and a

mail intercept operation.

 

Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by eo maT of “the”, r5eay

 

7 telephone company who was handled ‘by a. Station case officer. The number

of lines ‘tapped was limited only by the availability of a listening post

“nearby and the availability of lTangauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

: American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by: a Station case officer

: assisted by technicians on TOY from Headquarters who advised the Station

: on the best types of cameras, films, -and concealment devices. These

“operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

visited the Warrenton] Record's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search of additional photographs of the
“unidentified man''. We were unable to locate any such
photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have
been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and

that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters

for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed
