This letter was written in Chicago on September 13, 1963.
The writer says that he has not seen any publicity for the
Leipzig Fair in the American Press of the Middle West.

The writer says that thousands of business opportunities
will get lost and thousands of potential visitors will be detained.
He points out that in Chicago, Illinois, over 700,000 German-
Americans live; among them, hundreds of thousands from Saxony and
Thueringia who would like to visit their old homeland and the
Leipzig Fair. The writer says that he is able to get reports
pertaining to the Leipzig Fair and “other achievements in the
German Democratic Republic" into the American and foreign-
language press of the Middle West. He thinks that the addressee
will be interested in placing announcements about the Leipzig
Fair in the German-language newspapers in Chicago and Milwaukee.

"I have been engaged for many years in public relations
work and was formerly a professor of law at Yale University and
Consul General of Guatemala in Chicago. I.can find in my work
the support of numerous experienced persons and have the necessary
social relations in order to make our cooperation an outstanding
success."
