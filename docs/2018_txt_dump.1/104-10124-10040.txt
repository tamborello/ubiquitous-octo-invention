7. The crew members were all in uniform and not in mixed
civilian and Air Force clothing, which properly estab-
lished their cover,

8. Sufficient pressures were exercised by Agency, State,
Air Force, and Executive action upon the Soviets to
effect the release of the crew as soon as possible.

9. A factor that probably had an important bearing was the
early acknowledgment by the Soviet Foreign Office of
the downing of the aircraft and the attempts by the
Soviets in the early stages to make this appear as a

- deliberate violation of the Soviet air frontier, This

tended to take the "play" away from the MVD. and military;
intelligence, In addition, this Government was stepping
up the tressure for the release of the nine Army person-
nel who landed in East Germany in a helicopter, and the
Soviets probably had no desire to create a duplicate of
this incident.

10. Safeguards taken by the Agency and the Air Force were
such that there was no leak to the press, during the
crew's internment, of the fact that there was an in-
telligence connection of the flight and crew of the
Cm118,

That it is not believed, based on the evidence at hand, that
the crew was drugged or otherwise tampered with medically.

That there are valuable points of guidance from a cover, opera-
tions, policy and code of conduct standpoint which can be
gathered srom experiences of these crewmen in the hands of the
Soviets and can aid the Agency and its personnel in any future
situation of a similar nature in which the Soviet military and
RIS interrogators are encountered.

On 2 July 1958 this Agency received information indicating that
the Soviets might be considering releasing the nine fliers, Since no
date or place of release was indicated, cables were sent to the various
peripheral CIA stations around the Soviet border indicating the possi-
bility of impending release. The Air Force agreed to alert its Air
Attaches in the sam areas of the possibility of impending release, At
the same time a team of Agency personnel, including a medical officer,
an Air’Maritime officer, and two representatives of the Security Office
were dispatched to Wiesbaden from Headouarters in anticipation of the
release of the fliers. Three hours after the team arrived in Germany’,
the place of release was learned from the Soviets to be Astara on the
Soviet-Iranian border, and a USAFE plane was dispatched that night from
Wiesbaden with the Air Maritime team member aboard destined for
Teheran to await the turnover of the American fliers at Astara. The
fliers were turned over on 7 July 1958, were immediately flown to
Wiesbaden, Germany where an initial joint CIA-AF debriefing of them
was begun, and where initial press interviews were held, following

‘SUBJECT: American C-118 Aircraft Downed in Soviet
Azerbaijan 27 June 1958 by Soviet MIG~17's

On 27 June 1958, a C~118 cargo plane, assigned to the U. S. Air
Force in Wiesbaden, was fired on and forced down near Gend. Sovrieey

Azerbaijan. The plane was carrying nine U. S. airmen

| “jassigned to Wiesbaden, Germany. The nine men
were en route from Wiesbaden to Teheran and Pakistan on a flight carry-

ing cargo for CIA. |were planning to get off 24
the plane in Teheran had the plane remained on Gourse.)

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The plane, while en route to Teheran from Nicosia and as a result
of bad weather and navigation error, went off its plotted course and
crossed into Soviet Armenia. There it was intercepted and fired on by
three MIG-17's and caught fire in the left wing. Five of the crew bailed
out and the other four rode the aircraft down to a safe landing on a
small airstrip at Genfarkh in Soviet Azerbaijan. The crew members who
had remained on the plane to its landing got out safely and the plane
was burning fiercely when the crew last saw it. The part of the crew
that parachuted was surrounded by Soviet peasants, some of whom beat and

i the crew menbers. One of the nen,| [bs
was taken by the mob to a telephone pole and narrowly escaped
hanging before being rescued by the Soviet military.

a the remainder of the crew were turned over to the
Sovis military, and after an overnight stay in a Soviet military
garrison near Stepanakert were taken to a city believed to be Yeviakh,
and then flown to Baku, Russia. There they underwent interrogation by
Soviet intelligence officers, at leest one of whom had served in the
United States, as a Soviet Purchasing Commission employee 1943-h5, and
later in Canada in 1949-55 as First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy.

peasants on landing and was later turned back to him by the Soviet
Commission members at Baku, Neither he nor other members of the crew
were questioned about either of the briefcases, their contents, nor
about the address book and its contents, We assume that the Soviets
have or will process the names in the address book through their Moscow
files. Some of the other crew members carried personal notations in
their wallets relating to a few other CIA personnel.

We have received no indications that or the_other 0°
crewmen were drugged or otherwise tampered with by the Soviets.
and some of the others did receive shots the first night and second day

from the Soviet military for their wounds and burns; however, these
shots are believed to have been for legitimate medical reasons, .

 

 

The substance of the questioning, treatment and techniques of
interrogation has been exhaustively explored with all the crew members
in the course of the debriefings. In summation, the interrogations
of the crew members were superficial and do not appear to have. been
backed up by close coordination and commmication with Moscow for
intelligence research purposes, It is possible that the quick ace
knowledgment by the Soviet Foreign Office of the landing of the C-118
in Soviet territory precluded the MVD fully exploiting the crew
member Ss" were separated from the
group and given preferred treatment, apparently with the intention of
Geveloping them for information purposes. We are convinced that both -
men handled themselves extremely well and did not disclose any infor-
mation concerning the Agency or its activities,

 

 

 

To date we have ne indication that the Soviets knew at the time
they interrogated the crew men, that the flight of the C-118 =
nected with CIA in any way, nor that they knew 24
were CIA personnel. We do believe that in time the Soviets, through

O83 een oor book, which lists the open Agency telephone number

= below his name on the first page, will connect him and . .
possibly others in the address book with CIA, Since the Soviets
questioned him about the 7170th Support Group and the 705th Support
Squadron in Wiesbaden, it is therefore presumed that they will asso-
ciate those units with this Agency. :

 

 

In addition to this report, debriefings of the crewmen
were taped and typed, which will total some 7,000 - 9,000 pages
when completed, are being distributed to the CI Staff and

other interested components of this Agency as they are completed.
Questions were solicited by this Office of all interested components,
in order to cover all matters in the debriefings of interest to the
Agency. Careful arrangements have been made with the Air Force in
order that Agency interests will be adequately protected and proper
security will be maintained in the handling of information and reports
derived from the debriefings, and so that no compromise of the Agency
interest in the flight of the C-118 will be made to the press.

CONCLUSIONS:
A. It ds our opinion that the possible compromises arising out of
: this incident are relatively minor in nature and that no majér

compromises occurred.

B, That the Soviets "missed" on the true nature of the flight and
personnel of the C~118,

 

C. That the reasons the crew members were given an early release
were as follows:

1. Primarily, the Soviet interrogators failed to use all
of the leads at their command, particularly } oF
address book, and failed to break the crewmen ug,
interrogation,

 

2. The crew did not inadvertently disclose through ine
terrogations, the purpose of their flight, its relation
to the Agency and that of (pt its crew to CIA.

3. The Soviets apparentl; Pratied to check out the names
and other data in( "_— Jpcarese book through their
files prior to reléase of the crew.

, No incriminating information or material was immediately
recovered from the burned aircraft.

5. Several of the crew destroyed incriminating building
passes and notations in their wallets while on their
way down in their parachutes, or immediately after
landing in their chutes.

6, There were either no leaks or insufficient leaks of
incriminating information through any room conversa-
tions at Baku among the crew, which may have been moni-
tored by the Soviets, or such conversations as there
may have been vere not properly interpreted, or inter-
preted soon enough to tip the Soviets that there was

; sonething unusual, about the flight or the crew.,
