GUS ALEX
ANT I-RACKETEERING

Alex, who has been a le f
Chicago’s First Ward since the th of Jake Guzik in 1956,“has -
been closely associated with Sa Giancana, the now deceased
Murray Humphreys and others in“the Chicago criminal organization.
He has made annual trips to Europe and-until 1965 made stops in’
Bern, Switzerland. -*

   

On February 3, 1967, the Swiss pronounced an interdiction,
preventing Alex from thereafter visiting Switzerland. During the
course of a lengthy appeal, Alex caused numerous letters attesting
to a good background to be directed to Swiss authorities and in
early March, 1967, the Swiss stated they had concluded they do not
have evidence to uphold the ban against Alex's entry.

Legal Attache, Bern, ascertained from Swiss authorities
that among the letters received by them was one from Congressman
William L. Dawson of Chicago, stating that Alex was his
constituent and’ friend for many years and he knew him as a law-
abiding, decent, successful representative of the Chicago busines
community. Dawson, of course, is well known to the Bureau as
having supported the Communist Party and the Communist Party, line<
In addition, he is alleged tobe involved with the policy .anid-
Syndicate racket in Chicago.

Another letter was received by the Swiss from Senator
Everett McKinley Dirksen, which asked that Alex be’ informed of the
basis of his exclusion from Switzerland and, that the: Swiss ; ;

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

Re: Gus Alex

Chicago, in attached teletype, makes reference to.
the above and points out that in view of Congressman Dawson's
unsavory background no action should be taken with respect to
him, but in view of Senator Dirksen's reputation of integrity,

‘that the Bureau may desire that he be advised of Alex's

background.
ACTION:

It is noted that Senator Dirksen is on the Special
Correspondents List. It is, therefore, recommended that Crime
Records liaison contact Senator Dirksen and because of his
apparent unfamiliarity with Alex, advise the Senator of Alex's
background. In view of the fact that it is entirely possible
Senator Dirksen is unaware of letter sent on behalf of Alex to
Swiss authorities, Senator Dirksen should be tactfully advised
of the receipt of this information by the Bureau. Only if
pressed for details as to our source, should it be indicated
to him that our Legal Attache in Bern, Switzerland, was advised
by the Swiss authorities that Senator Dirksen's letter was
among a number of letters which was being considered by the
Swiss in connection with Alex's appeal from interdiction.

If recommendation is approved, appropriate background
on Alex will be provided the liaison Agent.
