2. We then had FAINEERG make contact with GREJBINA for the estensible
purpose of interviewing her about this celebration. GRJEBINA gave him an
appointment on 14 May. However, she telephoned FAINBERG in the morning of

the lith and, claiming to be too busy, asked him to get the desired informa-
tion directly from the man who was responsible for arranging the event, the
Soviet Consul Boris Feodorovich KAZAKOV (201-255600), telephone WAGram 14:03
(the number of the Soviet Consulate). FAINEERG telephoned KAZAKOV two days
later, identified himself as being from ABEGGHEAD/B and told him that GRJEBINA
had suggested that he contact him direotly to get some information about the
Planned commemorative event for publication in AEEQGHEAD/B. _ KAZAKOV was very
polite to FAINBERG and invited him to come to. his office at 1430 on 18 May.
When FAINBERG gained admittance to the Consulate at: the appointed hour (which

ig not open for normal business in the afternoons), he was told by an un- .
identified Soviet abaut 25-30 years old who opened the door that KAZAKOV had bee
called to the Embassy and had not left any word about an appointment with .
FAINBERG. FAINBERG gave his card te the young Soviet and asked that KAZAKOV
call him. Later in the afternoon, FAINBERG tried te reach KAZAKOV on the _
telephone, but there was no’ answer. KAZAKOV never called back.

3. The event toek place en 22 May 1966. It is best described in the -
official invitation, a translatien ef which follews: ;

Dear citizen,

The Consular Section of the Embassy of the USSR in
France and the Honorary Committee of Russian artists in 9°.
France invites youto a Commemorative Rvening of Soviet
Citizens which is dedicated to the 2lat anniversary of
‘the end of the Great Fatherland War and Victory over

Hitlerite Germany. :

The event. will take place on Sunday, 22 May 1966,
at 20 hours, in the "Mutualite" hall (24, Rue Saint-Victor,
Paris 5). :

The evening's program:

1. Commemorative part
2. Concert by Soviet artista and by Russian
artists residing in France. .

THE EMBASSY OF THS USSR IN “FRANCE

k, “A handsomely printed program brochure preminently listed the nembers
of the Committee of Honor which consisted of 14 French personalities of Russian
origin, most of whom mage active in the arts. Among others, there was~ HAASLAVSKY
President of the "Federal Union of Voluntary Units of Fereign Origin in the
Resistance Army" (whom we noted in 1965 to have been’a contrct of AEDIGIT-1),
GRJEBINA, and - much to FAINBERG's surprise - Lev ARONSON.

5. We had FAINBERG contact ARONSON to find out why he appeared on the :
honorary committee and to attempt to elicit any information regarding thse nature —
of this relationship with KAZAKOV. FAINBERG had a suitable pretext since “4
AEEGOHEAD was planning to do ~ and did- an editorial condemning this event as
a Soviet «propaganda effort. ‘FAINHERG visited ARONSON on 1 June, and this is

what he learned from him:.

SUMMARY: ‘This dispatch describes the tactios used by the ‘Soviet Ss

nsulate in gain: gaining the cooperation of a local Russian emigre to lend we
e to a "cultural" event, overtly sponsored by the Soviet Consulate.” We _

onsider this report of some interest because it shows that the Consulate

ppears to be still active in local emigre circles and using the time-honored |
tics of pressure and blackmail although, in this instance, not for the

_ &pparent purpose of recruiting an intelligence agent but rather for support :

oi Soviet. propaganda aims. The information was. obtained by Lowell R.. FAINBERG

{ his role as AEEGGHEAD/B |'journalist."

b) GRJEBINA brought KAZAKOV to ARONSON's restaurant for dunsh,
and they asked ARONSON to serve on the honorary committee, ARONSON refused
because he felt that the 22 May event seemed to have political overtones.
KAZAKOV accepted his refusal, although he denied any political propaganda

Purposes. However, ARONSON did Promise to collaborate with Andre BARSACQ, a

KAZAKOV was grateful for the effer. ARBNSON remarked that BARSACQ wrote the
article, ARONSON translated it, but 1t was not printed in the official program
&s planned. :

. ; 6) Several days after KAZAKOV's visit to his restaurant, ARONSON
accompanied his brother-in-law to the Soviet Consulate where the latter wanted —
to obtain an extension. of hig Soviet exit visa. They were not received by

OV but by (Sergey Alekseyevich) LOKTEYEV (201=348434) who told them in .
substance the following: "We do not extend the visa for anyone. You want
hat we meet you halfway, but you do not want do do the same, and there ig
even talk that your sister iz getting ready to visit you." ARONSON understood
this to be a not too subtle allusion to his refusal te serve on the committee,
and then agreed to do as KAZAKOV had asked him to do. After that. his: brother- -
in-law's visa was extended. He told FAINBERG that he was not very proud of
himself to have given in to his blackmail, and that it troubled him greatly,
or the life of his sister.

: 6) ARONSON desoribed KAZAKOV as a "nice" and well educated
Person. He was @ pilot during World War IZ and ig a "Hero of the Soviet
Unien." He was on a short visit te Moscow to participate in the VE. Day
celebrations on 81/9 May 1966. 7 a .

\ . f) PAINBERG prouised ARONSON that he would see to it that his-
name would be kept out of the AREGQHEAD/B article criticizing the participation -
of} emigres in the 22 May event, which it was. ARONSON was very grateful and:
offered in turn to be of assistance to FAINEERG. ‘The latter then asked
ARONSON to keep him posted of visiting Russian artista who come to his reatauran
in! order that ABEGGHEAD/B gould be passed out to them. ARONSON promised that he
wopld do everything that he could, even offering to introduce FAINBERG per- ;

4, Station Comments

a) Our interest in ARONSON is predicated on the fact that the
Dom taurant is generally known to be frequented by visiting Seviet
artists ~ ARONSON himself has a theatrical background rears also peoause qooet
Soviets may frequent it. For example Deputy Chief of the Commero ssion
Aleksey Anatolyevich MALYSHEV (201-254801) indicated to Richard C. BASESCU that .
he knew the owner of the "Dominique" restaurant personally (OFPA-77690, 16 ;

December 1964).

 

ttempt
b) We are there fore planning to have FAINBERG make the a

to develop ARONSON as an unwitting source, keeping in mind, offourse, that aoneore
may| be trying to put the shoe on the other foot. This is.an example of the type |
of operational utility of FAINBERG when he uses his AELEDGER cover functtens

properly.
