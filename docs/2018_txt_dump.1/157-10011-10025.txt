from the Agency bocause of his involvement in the assassination

plans ‘against Prime Minister Castro.

PRPS

The facts are-that in June 1963 he was assigned .as

 
   

Chie’ of stats {Rin Jane in February of '67 he was ..- °°:
reassigned to CIA Headquarters. He retired voluntarily under
our retirement system on 31 of December 1967.

If I may, there is a — why he was taken out ana af I
could go off the record and mention that to the Committee. It
is a matter of his privacy.

Chairman Church. Very well, off the record.

(Off the — discussion)

Mr. Colby. - Back on the record.

Senator Schweiker.asked me whether Howard Hunt or Janes
McCord were in charge of Sextoan overations at the time of
President Kennedy's assassination on 22nd of November '63.

. Roward'Hunt from “July '62 to August '64 was assigned as a
Section Chief in hs bbvindon of Plans Directorate, which is
now the Operations Directorate at CIA Headguarters, which had
no responsibility whatsoever for Mexican operations.

Senator Schweiker. What were those dates again?

Mr. Colby. July '62 to August '64.

Senator Schweiker. Wasn't he at some point in Mexico
city and in charge of that office? _

Mr. Knoche. Way bard: in the '50's he served in Mexico

‘City. Way back. He was not in-charge.

5 Mr. Colby. No, he was in what we call, and we have since

9 Mr. McCord a June '62 to June '64 was assigned as a

+3 Senator Morgan last time asked what information was given

19 Director until the fall of '61, was a member of the Warren

on And then who made the decision not to provide it, if none
- was given? ‘Gur records do not indicate that there was a CIA

But I did want to clarify that. I think ‘I mentioned it
last time that there have been occasions on which this was
done.

Chairman Church. Mr. Colby, would you in connection with
your review of this matter supply the Committee with the spe-
cifics in those cases where the Agency has in fact engaged
private investigators to do Agency work?

Mr. Colby. “I will certainly try to, Mr. Chairman. 2
confess this may be a tough job to locate every case but I
certainly will do my best.

Chadxman Church. wild you provide the Committee with the
opinion of vedic Gonnell ati respect to the legality of such?

Mr. Colby. I will.

Chairman Church. Such use of private investigators?

Mr. Colby. Yes.

Chairman Church. And then I would ask the staff also
furnish the Committee with a brief on that question so that we
are-fully advised with respect to the law.

Me. Colby. Right.

The second subject, Mr. Chairman. Senator Mondale asked
for our command and control regulations for the approval of
covert action projects. These were supplied to the staff on
the first of May and are available to the staff.

Thirdly, {£ was asked if Mr. ‘William Harvey was removed

ACCOMPANIED BY SCOTT Ss. BRECKINRIDGE, IR., DEPUTY
INPSECTOR GENERAL, ENO KNOCHE, ASSISTANT VO THE
DIRECTOR, At!D GEORGE L, CARY, LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL

Mr. Colby. JI have an answer to a few of the questions
that were raised at the mesting the other day and there are a
couple of clarifications I would like to make.

One, with’ respect to the security investigations in the
United States. The question was asked whether we ever used
private investigators, and I said we normally used our’ own
investigators. We have some relationships with private
investigatory firms which provide cover for our investigators
ta seennaly, we have a few firms which we own which are
proprietary’ if you will, vhereby our investigators appear to
be private. ~

I said that in the past it is. clear that on occasion we
did ask for private investigator firms to help us to some
degree, It was usually the one that was giving us cover, and
£0 reasons of overload we asked them to have their own people
to do a few of the investigations,

My General Counsel says that this is illegal. I kave a
strong auesticn about its propriety, if not legality, and I
am undertaking to revicw this matter to see whether we can not
just eliminate that practice aviinedy, continuing the prose
