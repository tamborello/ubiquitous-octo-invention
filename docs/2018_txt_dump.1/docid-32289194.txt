Remyairtel, 3/6/61.

On 3/8/61, PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III, as
follows: ; . . .

- Recently, one RALPH THOMAS, no other identifying information,
took about $2,000 worth of knives, forks and other utensils, all
made of aluminum, to KELLY MANNARINO in Florida, reason unknown.
There were too many for.MANNARINO.to use in his home in Surfsile,
Fla., so KELLY must have a restaurant or other outlet there.

SAM MANNARINO recently visited Florida, and while he was there
he did not 8top to see his brother, KELLY. This probably means
that they are still feuding. . a .

On the same date, PG 612-C furnished SA FORSYTH with a copy of
an Empire Treasury Lottery Ticket, obtained 3/3/61, at City
News, 859 Third Ave., New Kensington, Pa., a numbers racket

time, informant stated these tickets are being distributed i
the New Kensington area by the "MANNARINO mob." *
