Revelations of abuse of power, do not threatan domestic

it is its failure to adhere to the proper role of law

began to use its energy to spy on Americans whose only

. That is what we meant by. & free government, and our
forefathers were convinced that- ie can exist only through the

greatest tolerance of ‘spaech and opinion, They placed their
faith in the people to remain alert to encroachments on their
liberty. .

The foundérs of our country knew that the greatest
danger to freedom cones from the efforts of government to
suppress the opinions of its opponents. They set up a
system which limited the powers of. government. bound it in
the constraints of the law, and prohibited it from infringing:
on the rights. of people to free expression. And through
the. separation of power, the system. of checks and balances,
they tried to assure’ that the Executive would’ bs accountable
to the people through the Congress. ~

For the 200 years-of our existence as a nation the
preservation of Liberty has. baen a constant struggle. . Whether
it has. been the Alien and Sedition Acts during the French
Revolution, tha Red Scare and the palmer Raids of World War
I, or McCarthyism after World War II, or Army. spying during
the Vietnam War, the government has let a-fear of unorthodox
opinion lead it into the trap of infringing upon the
Constitution in the name of internal security.

The issues we confront today are a part of a continuing

drama of American democracy. It is proof, if we svar needed

it, that the price of liberty is ‘eternal vigilance.

FBI has ever had ah opportunity to know and appreciate the
full extent of the domestic. surveillance program that was
then being. conducted. oe .

‘Thus we see that just as‘in the case of the CIA the
key issue was accountability: How we can assure that the
sacret instruments of government are accountable to the
people, .the Congress and the law.

Tt is clear that the FBI's authority for these programs
is essentially non-existent. I am not persuaded that the

Secret Presidential orders of. President Roosevelt support the

Domestic Intelligence program, and even if it did, I do
not believe that any President has the authority to order the
FBI or anyone alse to spy on Americans, to burgle their homes,
to wiretap them, to open their mail or to blackmail them.
one of the most disturbing aspects of this. affair is
that the FBI never paid very much attention to whether their
activities ware authorized or not or whether they were legal
and constitutional, One former -senior intelligence officer

has testified that he never once heard a discussion about

legality or constitutionality. Most governments in history

have relied on some form of police power to determine what
views would prevail in their society. However,’ America was
“based on the. revolutionary ‘soncept that the people should
decide what is right and what is wrong, what is acceptable

and what is not.

Senator Mondale. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I have always supported thea PBI. It is clearly the finest,
most professional law enforcement agency in the nation and
probably in the world.. In apprehending robbers, foiling
kidnappers, catching fugitives, the FBI has an outstanding
record. .

This is based on my own experience with the FBI dn my

own state where I served as Attorney General. The vast bulk

-of its work is devoted to law enforcement and legitimate

counter-espionage,

In these fields the FBI deserves fully the admiration
and vespact which amaricans traditionally held for the Bureau
and its personnel. But in one area, domestic intelligence,
the FBI, in my opinion, has clearly gone astray. It now
appears that there was an underworld within the FBI which
tock the tools, techniques and geal which was so effective
against the real foreign threats and turned..them in upon some
of the American people.

yesterday this Committee heard soma of the most disturbin
tastimony that can be imagined in a free society. We heard
avidence that for decades the institutions designed to enforce
the laws and constitutions of our country itself has been
engaging in conduct that violates the law and the Constituticn.
We heard that the FBI, which is a part of the Department of

Justice, took justice into its own hands by seeking to punish

those with unpopular ideas. We learned that the chief law
enforcement agency in thé Federal government decided that it

aid not neéd laws to investigate and suppress the peaceful

and constitutional activities of those whom it disapproved.

We heard testimony that the FBI, to protect the country
against those it believed had totalitarian political views,
employed the tactics of totalitarian societies against
American citizens, We heard that the FBI attempted to destroy
one of our greatest leaders in the field of civil rights, and
then replace him with someones of the FBI's choosing.

From the evidence the Committee has obtained it is
Clear that the FRI for decades has conducted surveillance over .
the personal and political activities of millions of Soa.
Americans. Evidently, no mésting was too small, no group
too insignificant to sscaps their attention. It did not
‘seem to- matter whether the politics of these anericans were
legal or radical or whether the participants were well: known
or obscure. It did not matter-whether the information was
intimate and personal. The FBI created indexes, more.
commonly called enemy lists, of thousands of Americans and
targeted many of the Americans on these lists for spscial
harassment. Hundreds of thousands of Americans were victims
of this surveillance program. Most of this was done in secret.
Much of it was kept from Congress and the Justices Department

and all of it from ths American people. Mo one outside the
