BACKGROUND

1.) On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,
Fidel castro appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in
nn, SM SESY Feception

Havana;. even more Unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press correspondent,

Daniel HARKER, ,
2.  HARKER's interview reached Nei York On Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on
Monday, 9 September, There: can: be. ro question from the
facts surrounding the” CASTRO“ appdarance, which had not been
expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this
event represented a more~than-ordinary attempt to get a
message on the record in the United States.

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,
used a UPI wire Service report which omitted any reference
to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real
significance, The Washington Post did an abbreviated re~
write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted
any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consig-
eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba. There is no evidence
in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission
sta itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview
in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no
evidence in the files that anything alon these lines was

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results
