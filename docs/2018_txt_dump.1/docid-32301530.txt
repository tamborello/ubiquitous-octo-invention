they wanted to know for sure whether or not CV 559-PC is
connected with MC NAMARA, He stated he also told AIELLO
that he doesn't want’ anyone coming to him complaining. to
him about MC NAMARA, or how MC NAMARA does business, or
that MC NAMARA is not paying his bills, because he has
nothing to do with MC NAMARA,

CV 559-PC stated this group is attempting to
monopolize the gambling business in Youngstown and apparently
hopes to have full control in the near future, He stated
they have apparent full police protection, and know the FBI -
has the Tropics Lounge under surveillance and for tiis reason,
inasmuch as they congregate so in the open at the Tropics,
they are net banking their business there, and that is
done elsewhere and they have nothing to fear at the Tropics
and would welcome a raid to further inflate themselves in the
eyes of the public, and their associates, that they cannot
be. touched,

CV 278-C-TE advised that JAMES PETRELLA, aka "Dankers",

has closed his 98 Club in downtown Youngstown, and has _. .
placed his liquor license in escrow, inasmuch as the State
of Ohio would have closed the place for non-payment of taxes.

CV 278-C-TE stated that on the night of 9/27/64,
he received a phone call from "Fats" AIELLO and "Fats" told
him he would.like to see him, Informant agreed, and AIELLO,
accompanied by LEO MOCERI, aka "Lips", (close associate of
JAMES LICGAVOLI, aka Jack White, of Cleveland) picked him up
with ATELLO driving MOCERI's Cadillac. He stated they drove
to a restaurant and drank coffee and spent a good deal of time

talking, MOCERI asked informant about his partner (MICKEY SAFFRON,

owner of Saffron Cigarette Service) and informant stated he

has no partner, and he only works for SAFFRON, MOCERI then

asked informant if he minded if he, MOCERI and AIELLO would
shake SAFFRON for a couple hundred dollars, and informant stated
he wouldn't mind as long as they gave him a "cut" of the

money; and MOCERI promised informant he would give him $50 if
successful. MOCERI also asked informant about the City of
Campbell, as he had heard that informant had all of the pool
tables in Campbell on location, CV 278-C-TE stated this was

not true, that he had none, and he then mentioned to AIELLO

that he was not doing any of the talking, at which time AIELLO

told him he had heard that he was going to take over all
of the pool tables in Campbell, Informant stated this
was wrong, but that he wouldn't mind taking them over,
however, he has no money to invest, and told MOCERI and
ATELLO that if they got him the pool tables and the
locations, he would put the tables on location, and
service them provided there was a "dollar" in it for
him,

CV 278-Cc-TE stated that both MOCERI and AIELLO in-
dicated they could work with the informant, and he then
stated they asked him about unionizing the pool table operators,
inasmuch as they are not under union protection at the
present time, although the cigarette vendors and music box
operators area, Informant stated he told them this would be
a good idea, and asked MOCERI how this would stand with JOE
FONTANA and LOUIS "BABE" TRISCARO of the Vending Machine Union
in Cleveland, to which MOCERI replied, "they're with us,"

 

CV 278-C~TE stated this is the same way that AIELLO
began his operation years ago when he started the National.
Cigarette Service in Youngstown, AIELLO stole every cigarette
machine location he could and whenle developed a substantial
route, he used the Teamster's Union in Cleveland to come in
and organize the vendors and in this way the Union told each
operator that he couldn't steal one location from another
operator, and they had to hold the locations they had as of
that Gate, and in this way ATELLO was protected,

Both CV 278-c-Te and cv 544-0 expect there will be
some kind of trouble arising out of the activities ef the
group at the Tropics,

The Bureau has been previously advised that ANTHONY
DELSANTER of Warren lost his position with the "organization"
in Warren and Trumbull County because he used "organization".

Tropics. He stated this group is operating with full police
protection, and they have no fears of being raided at any
time, He stated RONCI recently purchased a poolroom

(Past Time. Billiards) located below the Tropics on the same
side of the street (next door to the Shang-Ri-La) from BERNIE
ALTSCHULER, another gambling hustler, who is currently .
in Florida. He stated he feels this group may be banking
their bets at this poolroom, as it is only a short distance
below the Tropics. .He also stated he has heard that this”
group is not using the upstairs of the Tropics for banking
their gambling operation.

JOHN BURNICH and went inte the gambling business for himself,
MC NAMARA came to the irformant one day and asked him if he
wanted to be a 50 per cent partner with him inasmuch as he
has taken over much of informant's former stops. He stated
he told MC NAMARA that if he wanted to be in the business
he would be in it 100 per cent, and would split with no one,
and in view of this MC NAMARA could have any business he wanted
and should not even contact him regarding any problems as he
was out entirely,

cv 559-PC stated a few days later he was approached
by AIELLO and ATELLO asked him "if I would ask you some

' questions, would ‘you give me a truthful answer?" Informant

stated he told AIELLO that if the questions were such that he
felt he could answer them he would answer truthfully, and

if they were such that he felt he could not answer truth-
fully, he would answer by telling AIELLO "I can't answer that"
ATELLO said that was fine and better than he expected, ATELLO
then asked the informant if he was in the gambling business. ._
with EUGENE MC NAMARA, and informmt stated he was not, has

not been, and has no intentions of doing same. AIELLO stated
he was happy to learn this and happy that CV 559-PC spoke so
truthfully and then said that he and his group (which according
to CV 559-PC consists of RONALD DAVID CARABBIA, DOMINIC P,
SENZARINO, JR,, LOU TIBERIO, ATELLIO VELTRI, aka "New York |
Jack", and JAMES PETRELLA, aka "Dankers", and possibly others)
