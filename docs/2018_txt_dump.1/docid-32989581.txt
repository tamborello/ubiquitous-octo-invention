Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

the transmittal of the report to the President; the
subsequent receipt of a letter signed by Tom Charles Huston
implementing the Plan; the meeting of Mr. Hoover with then
Attorney General John Mitchell; the reaction of Attorney
General Mitchell to the Plan; and the subsequent recall of
Huston's letter by the White House.

Throughout the report, there are reflected
statements made by various senators of the SSC during
hearings of the Committee on the Huston Plan, In addition,
there are portions of testimony by former Attorney General
Mitchell, former Director of CIA Richard Helms, and former
Chief of the Counterintelligence Staff, CIA, James Angleton,
as well as the exchanges which occurred between Senator
Church and Mitchell, Helms and Angleton, Throughout the
report, there are references to Bureau officials testifying
without naming these officials. Mr. Loch Johnson agreed
that these officials would be named and identified them
as being William C, Sullivan and Charles D. Brennan.

The report_highlights the fact that there was
considerable coilusion between Sullivan and Huston during —
the 1 early ‘Stages of the preparation“of_ “this report, It"
also highiiehts | the fact that Sullivan changed his tactic
upon the resignation of Cartha D. Deloach, tormér Assistant
to the Director, stating ing that St Sullivan's tactic was to
ensure that he would be designated as DeLoach's_ replacement,

It particularly notes notes that Sullivan engaged in duplicity
in hat he was telling Tom Charles Huston that he was in

faver of _a commendations contained in the Huston Plan
while advising Mr. Hoover_that, ~kecommendations in the .
Huston Plan could cause problems for the Bureau,

Dear Dave:

This is to confirm (belatedly) in writing what
I told you several months ago. On November 5, 1975, I
gave pp. 2-9 of your deposition of October 21 to
Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Smothers, with a memorandum
setting forth our agreement and your request that
Committee members be told of your concern.

Since it appears that the Senators did not
actually see your deposition, I have copied pp. 2-7
and 60-62 (which contain your final statement) and
will see that the Committee members receive them when
they are given the draft COINTELPRO report. If you

 

z have any objections to this, please let me know.

TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to my letter dated January 22, 1976,
enclosing copies of a memorandum of the same date, with enclosures
reporting interviews conducted by the Senate Select Committee (SSC)
staff with Special Agent David Ryan of the Intelligence Division, FBI,
on October 16 and 21, 1975.

Enelosed for your information is a copy of an SSC letter
dated February 26, 1976, which was directed ta Special Agent David
Ryan by Miss Barbara Ann Banoff of the SSC staff, This letter was
apparently sent in accordance with an agreement made by Banoff
with Ryan that he would continue his interview relating to this
Bureau's discontinued Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros)
only if his concern regarding the preoecupation of the SSC staff in an
area of sensationalism was communicated to the Chief Counsel and
Minority Counsel of the Committee.
