6. Notwithstanding the negative finding about the
handwriting, we have compared the typing in the "LIFE

from ito the Agency, and it is our conclusion
that the ~% Magazine" letter was typed on the same
machin was been using to write letters to

Agency personnel. 3

7. Furthermore, there are several similaritics
in the construction and lay-out, phraseology, and

general theme of the "LIFE Magazine" letter and___ 03
KATONA's letters to lead to the conclusion that

typed the "LIFE Magazine" letter on bis own typewriter.

8. Some of these similarities, among others. are:
(1) All the paragraphs are indented five spaces in both the
questioned and known letters; (2) the use of hyphenated
phrases and clauses in the middle of sentences, (3) the use
of "SPY OUT IN THE COLD" in at least two instances, and
(4) several instances of appellations such as: "701 Class of

162" or "Agent 701".

9. SUMMARY: It is our opinion that KIMSEY can
be eliminated as a suspect in this matter. It is our
