ADMINISTRATIVE:

‘The Los Angeles Division in its efforts to penetrate
into the Italian underworld has, since the submission of the last

report, developed a live source, LA 4412-C-TE, who has now

maneuvered himself into a position where he is in daily contact

with SALVATORE LOUIS PISCOPO, . As aresult of this activity, the web

Los Angeles Division has now been able to ascertain that PISCOPO, ~~

On 11/30/62, PISCOPO departed the-Dos WKBSlés area

 

supposedly at the request of his boss in New York and this infor-
Mant mentioned above was able to determine from PISCOPO that in

his New York trip the family which PISCOPO was a member of had a
new boss who waS young and who had succeeded an\dld and sick man, |

orders not to have anything further to do with RIZZI would tend :
to indicate that PISCOPO probably is a member of, the PROFACI

group and he is possibly referring to SALVATO) PROFACI when he Aw
speaks of a new boss. ; ee 6 ee STF

 
 

 

 

The Los Angeles Division is presently effecting a

. confidential source in connection with PISCOPO in its efforts to

further penetrate into the Italian underworld and the set up of-
the various families.

‘There is no information available at this time that
would tend: to show any one individual as the head of a family in
this area such as has been reported by the New York Division in_
