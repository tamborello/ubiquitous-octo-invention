in the Sans Souci and witnessed the counting of it.
The total take from these machines was $11,000-$5,500 to the
"BATISTA people" and $5,500 for the Sans Souci.veHe sid the
$5,500 for the Sans Souci was taken to SANTOS TRAFFICANTE!'s
office but that when the figure was entered in on the books,

NY 92-886

To stimulate interest in bingdo, KEANE and BUCKNER
offered as a door prize a mink stole. After considerable
advertising regarding the door prize of the mink stole,
1600 people were in attendance the night it was given
away at the casino of the Sans Souci.

KEANE added that the "wise guys" felt that
this attendance was a "fluke." To show that they could
keep the attendance high, KEANE stated the holders of ticket
stubs for the mink stole door prize were told that the stub
was worth $1.00 to play bingo on the following Monday evening.
KEANE explained that Monday was the worst night for attendance
at the Sans Souci. On this Monday night, 1100 people wer@si
attendance at the Sans Souci. As a result of this
increased attendance and the promise that he and BUCKNER
would supervise the entire gambling operation of the #
Sans Souci, they were to be given the concession of bingés ee,

    
  
 
 

 

KEANE stated that because bingo consistently
lost, he and BUCKNER did not feel that they could make any
money. He stated that the bingo concession lost an average
of $22,000 a month. He and BUCKNER, therefore, proposed
that they be given a percentage of the entire gambling operation

“of the Sans Souci. They pointed out that if $22,000 was the
average loss per month and they operated the concession in
the future for say $10,000 loss, they would in fact have
made $12,000 for the casino. If bingo, for a given month,
would. break even they would have made $22,000 for the casino.
They also pointed out that they could keep attendance high
at bingo by offering door prizes, etc., and that the side .
games of "21, roulette and crap" would naturally profit from
the added. attendance.

As a result of the above and with the understanding
that KEANE and BUCKNER manage the entire operation of the
Sans Souci, the breakdown was then to be:

 

TRAFFIC ANTE 4og
STASSI 20%
GONZALEZ 20%
KEANE and BUCKNER 20%

: KEANE stated that now that he represented
20% of the Sans Souci he was offered the opportunity

to see the books and observe the overall operation of

the casino. He stated that for a period of about. two weeks,
he watched the operation of "21, roulette and crap,"

giving particular interest and attention to the security

of the money to make sure "No one was taking off the top,"

He added that during the course of his
obversation of the casino he talked to the cashier, a Cuban
national who said the "bank" for the Sans Souci was about
$400,000. On closer scrutiny of the books, howeveas he
determined that the actual cash on hand was $16,000 and the
remainder of the $400,000 was in I.0.U.'s and checks
"dated from the year 1", which he considered worthless.

He said that because of the above and the following incident,
he and BUCKNER left Cuba and returned ‘to the US.

Ff

KEANE stated that he was in Cuba the last i
four or five days in June, 1957; for about eight or ten
days in July, 1957, and from mid-September to the end of
October, 1957. During this time, KEANE stated he never
received any money, paid for him own expenses and did not
put any money into the operation of the Sans Souci,

: KEANE said the main reason he left the Sans
Souci and Cuba and returned to the US was the result of the
small bank and the following: ~

He explained that slot machines were illegal in
Cuba but that all casinos, hotels, etc. have a large number
of slot machines. He states this was possible because a
relative of Cuban President BATISTA, who KEANE believed
was BATISTA's brother, had control of all these slot machines.
He stated that the relative of BATISTA got 50% of the "take"
from the machines and the remaining 50% went to the .
casino or hotel where the machines were located,

He said that on one occasion he witnessed
