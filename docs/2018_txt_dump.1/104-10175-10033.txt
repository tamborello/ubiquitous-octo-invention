gature and attentive. Ske has been prompt aud relisble is her
peetings. She Aineusses her probleas cainly and accepts instruction

dens and has sorked hard in trying to improve her reporting. Bhe '
appears to be well adjested to her environment which is most exe:
tresely trying at tines. ‘

In discussions concerning the Communist and leftiet novesents,
she adpitted that st oue time she was influenced by their ideology,
tet as she had growa older and had oteervea gore oi sheds activities
and personalities, she had lost allirespect for thes. She sald that,
ake had beem fooled by Fidel Castro in bis early aaye end bad :
thought he would be good for Cuba, bat as eventa ‘heve developed .
she has seen how mistaken she had been originall-. Ste also commented
that in long talks vith LIXLUCK, he had opened ber eyen to the .
fallecy of the Comcunist ideology. In all of these conversations .
she hes appeared sircere in ber statesente. Eer Mason with LISLECE
appeara to be based on deep affection fer tin and not on prozise

eaity. The case officer has the impression that if there sas not

a present Mra. LIWLUCK she would become legally his sife. This is
i

a problem that may kave to be faced in the future. :
