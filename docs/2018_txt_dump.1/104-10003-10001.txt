MEMO FOR THE RECORD:

1. After checking Graphics Registry files for pictures of Minsk
pertinent to the Oswald affair, arranged to have several
photographs reproduced and sent up to SR/CI/R. The photos were
ordered from Graphics and they reached us on 12 March. Upon examination
it was discovered that one of the photographs showing a group of persons
in front of the Palace of Culture in Minsk in the summer of 1961
included an individual bearing a strong resemblance to Lee Harvey
Oswald.

 

2. Enlargements of the picture were made by Graphics Register
and the Duke Street printing plant on 13 March, and 00/C was called
for details on the picture, its source, etc. The picture was
compared with photos of Oswald provided to us by the FBI (D-33 #16,30)

_ and known to have been taken in the Oswald apartment in Minsk during
aye 1952. This comparison showed that person appearing to be Oswald in
” the picture from Graphics Register was wearing a plaid short-sleeved
sport shirt with a pattern identical to that on the shirt Oswald
was wearing in the pictures furnished by the FBI.
Pp
pote A urther_ checks were made with 00 on 16 March and that
we office's approval¥for an FBI contact with the source of the picture.
On 17 March, the picture was shown to C/SR/CI, C/SR, DC/SR and|
It was agreed that I should draft a CSCI transmitting
the picture and information to the FBI and a letter transmitting
the same to the Warren Commission. I prepared both on 18 March
and received an OK on.both from C/SR/CI. I hand carried both to
Ray Rocca, C/CI/R&A who approved the CSCI but made certain minor
changes in the text of the letter to the Commission.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4. On 19 March, Ray Rocca relayed to me C/CI's view that
transmittal of the picture to the Commission should be delayed
pending receipt of the results of an FBI check made in response
to our CSCI. Note: CSCI asks FBI to contact source of picture
and obtain details re taking of picture, persons in it etc.
According to Rocca's note, C/SR had been called on this and agreed.
