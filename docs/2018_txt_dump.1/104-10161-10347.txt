CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS :

Western Hemisphere Division/Personnel has indicated that they
can delay their Career Agent certification to the field for no
more than one week. In view of the essentially favorable character
of all investigative efforts into Subject's background and activi-
ties, it is recommended that Subject's conversion to Career Agent
status be approved contingent upon the completion of a favorable
technical interrogation. Limited National Agency checks and
Police checks in the Miami area will be completed on a backstop
basis.
