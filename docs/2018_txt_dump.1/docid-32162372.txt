supjecr: Allegation by Thomas HOLT regarding the Assassination of President Kennedy

‘

1. On October 3, 1978, Inspector Donald Clements and I were interviewing
Thomas HOLT regarding an integrity matter, During a rambling discourse
: on his belief that the drug traffic is a mammoth conspiracy headed by
- ( 3:-DEA, HOLT mentioned that he was acquainted with Frank STURGIS of Watergate
'. Botoriety. HOLT stated that STURGIS once told him (in the presence of
one Bill JOHNSON) that he (STURGIS) had killed Fresident John F. Kennedy.
When asked why STURGIS would impart this interesting bit of news to a
_. known government witness, HOLT replied that it was said by "one hit
"gan to another.” :

 

 

2, STURGIS' alleged involvement in the late President's assassination
bas been widely reported by the news media, HOLT had previously stated
his intention to go to the news media regarding his allegations egeinst
DEA, Therefore, he ig likely to mention the STURGIS allegation as
well, Assuming that he would also tell them that he had reported the

_ @llegstion to two DEA Inspectors, I feel this memo ia necessary.

 

3. Should another government agency wish to pursue HOLT's allegation, —
, he eaid he was willing to meet with JOHNSON and discuss the matter on

“Cape to corroborate STURGIS’ statement.
