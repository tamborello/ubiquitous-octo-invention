"Finally, it was under the Kennedy government that
America found itself upset by civil war: an artifically
provoked war between white and negro American citizens,
which the negro leadérs today are calling ‘our revolution."

"On the whole, the three years of the Kennedy Government

indecision, of confusion and of fears. At the moment, the
_ Search for the organizer of the attack which cost the life

_the tragic things is that perhaps the American people will

work for at least a year. And if the crime was inspired by
someone. outside the U. S. it is doubtful that the truth will |
be known, because of the international complications it
might cause. - oa

"It is under these clouds that in the next election the
battle will be fought between the conservatives of both par-
ties, who judge the events of the Kennedy Government realisti-
cally, and the neo=republicans and democrats, who are :
determined to concentrate on the tragic death of the young,
honest but inexpert and impulsive president..." “

The article continues for a total of th ee pages, with .
an analysis of the forthcoming ‘election campaign, brickbats
for the Johnson Administration, etc. (The election-campaign
analysis stresses the writer's own enthusiasm for ,Barry :
Goldwater as the candidate most apt to be able to defeat both

Republican and Democratic liberals. )

8. In attempting to obtain an up-to-date edition of the

_ Anuaério de la Prensa Espanola as requested in reference, we learned

L-t at no new edition has-come out since 1962 and only the second of
the two 1962 volumes is still available. We are therefore forwarding

as Attachment 2 a copy of Volume 2 of the 1962 edition.

violent. in BL Espanol than in the general press. During the
early part “Of 1964, for example, the United States and its
government. were receiving a very poor press in Spain because
.Of U. Se efforts to persuade Spain to drop its profitable
- trade with Cuba.) . An example of the official propaganda
. style and approach as they tugn up in El Espanol was the
paper's farewell to the Kennedy Administration, in an article
in the 22 February issue, signed by one Benjamin. PRICE and
entitled "DESPUES DE KENNEDY - La Nueva Frontera: Una Herencia
que’ Divide a los Estados Unidos" (AFTER KENNEDY « The New .~
Frontier; A Heritage which is Dividing the United States"), i
The article was headed by a photograph of President’ Kennedy,
captioned "Behind Kennedy's popularity=-greater outside the °
U. S. than within it--were hidden the grave faults of the :
Democratic Administration." At-the beginning of the article, :
in bold-face type, was a summary of.the "heritage" of its. ; ‘
title: '

"AMERICA: The Cuban infection is spreading to all of Spanish :
“America. Castro is more dangerous than before; st
. the Russians have been replaced by the Chinese. — y

"ASTIA;, Since the assassination of DIEM, Communist pressure {

. on South Vietnam has grown constantly; the Americans
soon will have to choose between getting out, and
fighting alone.

"AFRICA: CHOU EN-LAI has reached the shores of the Mediterrane ne

"EUROPE: China has in fact taken over the role of guide of *

; “'the new peoples' of the black Continent, The
Utopians of Washington and London, are insisting on
disarmament without guarantees. Meanwhile, people
are still dying at. the Berlin Wall."

The text of the article itself begins:

"The Government of President. Kennedy was not a happy
government. During its three years of éxistence American
. Setbacks, both international and domestic, were far more :
serious than those that have occurred under any other
Government, The failure at the Bay of Pigs, only three
months after Kennedy's election, was caused solely by his
indecision. The project had been organized during the
Eisenhower Government, but if: Kennedy had wanted to he _
could have cancelled it before the 1800 Cuban patriots, % |
trained in ‘American, disembarked on the island without the |
air cover the Americans had Promised. . : !

 

"The 'shame of the Berlin wall, ' built in August of |
. the same year, damaged American international prestige.
The chief of the Free World did nothing when the Communists
put up that permanent barrier between the eastern and western |
parts of thé occupied city.

"In the summer of 1962 there was a stock market crash
comparable only to that-of 1929, The market was finally . :
stabilized, but tens of thousands of small investors had odes,
disappeared. . : :

 

- "The Cuban crisis of 1962, viewed without~tlie din of. al
\ propaganda, had as its greatest result the installation of :
: Communism in the Southérn Hemisphere. The propaganda experts
i painted the event as a great victory Hr the political ability
of the defunct president, who ‘thanks to his determined
attitude succeeded in avoiding a nuclear war.*

censorship by the Concordat between the Vatican and the Spanish
government—-and even this protection breaks down for’ publications
that go too far. beyond the censorship tabus. In short: before
the O'Brien article was published in SP it had been approved by
the Ministry of Information. If it had not been, the issuet:would

6. it the article was an anti-American Propaganda plant. the
two most likely points of origin would be:

: a. The Falange, which is the principal member of The
Movement (the other two members are the Carlists and the small
‘remnant of the old national-syndicalist J..0..N. S.} . The ;
‘ Movement is the only political organization legally allowed
to exist in Spain and, as the official political unit, is a
major part of the structure of the Government itself. The
Falange is ideologically anti-democratic, hence anti-American.
As it happens, its outlook in this field was illustrated nicely
in this morning's issue (12 May) of. Arriba, . in one of -the daily
editorials written by J. L. Gomez Téllo. The editorial,
entitled. "A: ‘Corpse for a Democratic War," is devoted to Defense
Secretary McNamara's current trip to South. Vietnam. It. says the
war is going very badly, but the Democratic Administration ean't
afford to’. pull out of it with an election coming. up. In Arriba’
view, "KHANH'S, army is suffering heavy losses-~double those of”
a few months ago. What does this mean? A-dangerous disinte=-
.gration, which began with the fall of President DIEM. How will
this affect those who were rubbing their hands with glee at:
the death of the only man who was galvanizing his people in
this life or death combat? But the Western world, which wants
nothing to do with the struggle against. Communism—--what is it
complaining. about now? KHANH is a democratic man. So energetic
that the most spectacular thing he has done in the past few
days has been to order the. ‘shéoting of NGO DINH CAN, the
younger brother of DIEM. The Americans turned him over to:
them. ‘As they turned over to STALIN the General VLASOV who
wanted to fight against Communism.) There are things for
which there seems to be no remedy in the demoliberal philo-
. sophy. One of them is. (its penchant for) showing its liberalism
“. by offering up the anti-Communists as propitiatory victims on
.the blodédy altars of democracy. Just when the ignoble term
twar criminal’=~a term invented by the Communists--seemed to
have been forgotten on. this side of the Iron Curtain, democracy
found a man to execute as such. DIEM and his brother were .
' sassassinated by the Communists... And now still another has
‘been Shot. We feel a Sensation of nausea at this conspiracy
mounted by the same ones who-—in the name of democracy and
‘ liberal-ism—-are-opening the~gates—to-Communisme!— :

"La Poli¢ia de Dallas Mato a Kennedy," ("The Dallas ‘Police Killed

it as soon-as.we receive it. Meanwhile,.American Embassy Madrid
Airgram. 581 of 5 Februaiy 1964 di scribed SP. as Falange~oriented
and added that. "since the Spanish’ ‘governm t has. close control over
the local press it is not difficult ‘to give matters of its most.
immediate interest the necessary publicity and it appears -that this
campaign (on establishing Mexican/Spanish diplomatic relations) if
not supervised is at least. encouraged by the Ministry of Information
or the: Foreign Office. re

between SP and the. Italian Secolo XX, but it might be noted there
is frequently cooperation~-Ttacit or formal--between official and.
semi~official Spanish propaganda organizations and those of the
Italian extreme right. .
