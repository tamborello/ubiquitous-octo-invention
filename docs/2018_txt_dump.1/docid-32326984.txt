GUY MENDOLIA is a close friend of ERANK
DELEGGE and PAT SCHANG and was brought in on
the robbery.

. PASCUCCI did not know about the tele-
phone "school bomb" alarm but stated the freight
train was supposed to-be longer than.it was, The
short train caused a ¢hase since the robbers
figured the police could not cross the tracks to
the bank from the station and sufficient time to '
catch them, before ‘they. made the getaway.

LA JOY was behind the counter with GERRY TOMAS-

the shots with a carbine through the rear win-

window first..D*'ARGENTO also fell. out of the car

at the garage of DELEGGE's residence.

through a nearby yard, where they got rid of some .
