the course of investigation being conducted in the cave, entitied
"Criminal Influence in International Teamsters Union, LOGad, 84
901, San Juan, Puerto Rico, ANTI-RACKETEERING" mentioned above’

Lieutenant ALVAREZ advised that the information
was furnished to the POPR by FEDERICO VIRELLA, Public Relations
Official of the Local 901 Teamsters Union, who is a paid
informant of the Police Department and operating under the
cover name of "ACE",

Lieutenant ALVAREZ advised that "ACE" could
furnish no other information other than that set out and was
unable to furnish any additional details regarding this informa-
tion, ,

Because of the informant's position with the
Teamsters Union, the POPR is concerned about protecting his
identity and believes that 1f the informant's identity were
known, 1t would be difficult to obtain information of the nature
this informant can furnish,

The letterhead memorandum is being marked "Confi-
dential" in that it contains information furnished by "ACE",
a confidential informant of the POPR, who is a highly placed
Teamsters official and should his identity become known, it
will destroy his future effectiveness and may endanger his
life,

No local dissemination is being made in that
such local dissemination couldreasonably result in the identi-
fication of the aforementioned source,

Careful consideration has been given to the source
concealed and his identity was concealed only in those instances
where necessary.

San Juan Office continuing contacts with Lieutenant
ALVAREZ and information obtained from him will be reported in
pertinent individual cases,
