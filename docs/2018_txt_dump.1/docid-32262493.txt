Enclosed are copies of a few things you might find of some
“interest and would want for your files.

First there's a carbon of a brief interview I had with Reinaldo

“Pico,:an admitted "former" CIA operative. He now works for Max

Leshik at Replica. He was in the original Watergate group but
id not participate in the break-in. He also was among those’

assigned to instigate the fracas during the Hoover funeral. In

anda list of those arrested. As you know, a few. escaped the
net; including Dick Watley and and Dennis Harber. The: former,

I-suspect, is the guy with the Mohawk haircut who may ‘be our

Odio connection, and the latter is the homosexual with right- -wing:

. associates.

- Also. enclosed are some notes from talks with former FBI agent, |
. former -Rampart's editor Bill Turner. (Garrison suspects:him of

being deep cover and, you'll notéce, Turner doesn't. mention in|
his letter to Schweiker that he worked with Garrison for a while. }
Turner touches on several points which, if so, may be significant.
He says those arrested at the New Orleans camp, including Sam :
Benton, were connected with Bosch. Because of Bosch's connection

with Posada and Posada's with Bishop. and Benton's with McClaney

“to Karl. McNabb whom, I'm told, is interested in joining the. Committee.

staff.* Turner is obviously close to McNabb. I found interesting.
McNabb 's former associations with both Bosch and the CIA. |

' I spoke with Garrison last night. He's still awaiting our necting,
‘but he'll be away next week. I wanted to check with him on Archcha

‘Smith, the fellow. who ran the anti-Castro opeaation.out of 544 Camp St.
‘Turns out Smith closed down the operation there a. year before Oswald
arrived in New Orleans. Garrison now feels the hundreds of hours he
put into investigating Arcacha-were a waste of time. He now feels

he was "remote."" "He looked more significant than he was," he says.

The Arcacha lead was developed by Turner and Bill Barry, a former

whom I?ve been in touch with recently.

' More to come on the No Name Key background.
