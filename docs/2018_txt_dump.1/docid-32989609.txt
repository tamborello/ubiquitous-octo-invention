Reference is mide to SSC Letter to the Attorney General,
with attached appendices, dated Nay 14, 1975, requesting certain
documents and other information from the FRI.

In Appendix DB, captioned "Request Pertaining te
Electronic Surveillance," the SSC desired a response to the
following request:

Special Agent (GA} Leo T. Clark ta the Assistant Special Agent
in Charge (BSAC} ox the Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the
fewark, Mow Jersey, Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
{FRI}, captioned 'Pretection of the President ~ White House
Enquiry. tH

In regard to the aforementioned, a thorough review of
the files of the Newark Office of the FBI did not reveal the
existence of a file bearing the caption, "Protection of the
President - White Mouse Inquiry." However, this review did
disclose the existence of a file bearing the caption, "Protection
o£ the President.” A thorough review of this file failed to

uncover any wiomoranda emanating from former SA Leo T. Clark at
any time.

Re: Superseded Sections of the
Manual of Instructions

NOTE:

Pursuant to a prior SSC request, we furnished them
current MOE Sections 36, 84, 86, 87, 88, 95, 97 and 122.
Due to the sensitive nature of Sections 105, 107 and 130,
these were made available for review only at FBIHQ.

Listed below are the Intelligence Division
representatives and the MOI sectiong reviewed for this

project:

Section 36-Espionage James W. Johnson crI-1

Section 84-Registration Act. Dennis R. Dickson CrI-3

Section 86-Sabotage Louis J. Brune Is-~2

Section 87~Investigations of William N. Preusse Is-2

As previously noted, there were no MOE revisions
during the period of interest to Section 95-Treason and
Section 97~VYoorhis Act.

The revisions.of the MOI requested by SSC consists
of approximately 2,200 pages and is approximately 9" in
height. Due to the bulkiness of these revisions, they are
not being attached to this memorandum.
