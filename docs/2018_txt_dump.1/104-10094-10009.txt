Q

Dear Bob: f

Herewith our comments on the reprise (or redoublement d'attaque)
on the "implications" paper on anti-Castro plotting. We won't
repeat comments on the unchanged errors in the earlier version
{some of which were errors, not contested presentation). Nor
will we address new substantive additions at this time. As we
are at the end (and from what we have been told, this is the last
end before final submission for the formal security review) our
future comments to you will be limited to security matters.

In conclusion, we continue to find security problems in the
footnotes. As you mentioned to us on 20 March that those we had
not seen would not present a problem, I am concerned that your
people may have overlooked things that would strike us differently.
It would be unfortunate if some oversight in processing the
material resulted in unexpected difficulties at the last minute.
You should take steps to avoid such a possibility. We stand
ready to review these.

 

Sincerely,
