MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

ATTENTION : Chief, Alien Affairs Staff
SUBJECT : Bernard L. BARKER
#201 333

1. Agency use of the Subject, which began in 1959,
continues to this date, at which time he is currently a
JMWAVE asset. There is considerable correspondence on
record, including some in his security file, concerning
the Subject regaining his lost U. S. citizenship.

2. The attached dispatch, UFGS-1018 dated 8 February
1962, summarizes the results of previous inquiries into
this matter. For your information, the Subject applied
for an immigrant visa in Caracas, Venezuela, and entered
the U. S. on that visa on 28 March 1962.

. 3. Also attached herewith is a copy of UFGA-16973
dated 24 July 1964 which is self-explanatory. The advice
of the Alien Affairs Staff is again requested as to
whether or not Subject has any recourse in this matter,

or must wait the required five years as a Resident Alien.
Please keep in mind that the Department of State file on
the Subject could not be located when this matter was last
reviewed. Whether or not a review of the Department's
file would prove beneficial is left to your judgement and
discretion.

4. Please direct your reply to the Security Officer,
WH Division.
