that it had originally been sponsored by some unknown
cultural ; group.. In connection with CONTE's broadcast,
he mentioned the name of the station as “WRUL" and when
asked to repeat it, did so in the same manner. It is.
noted, however, that he named the station manager as Mr.
BRENT and that New York letter of June 15, 1962, (Bufile
109-584, New York file 105-35253), page 9, sets forth
information identifying a Mx. BRENT as the president of
vadio station WWRL in New York City. Accordingly, it
possible that CONTE is working for station WWRL rather
WRUL, as he indicated,

 

 

During interview, CONTE stated that he has been in
contact with Ci fA representatives in Miami for some time and
that he furnishes them with information which he receives
in letters from Cuba in response to his radio broadcasts.
He noted that the CIA representative has never ackgowledged

to him that they are sponsoring his broadcasts. GO 4)

As CONTE has disbanded-the subject ‘organization
and is active in radio propaganda work, [apparently for ceICQY)
no further investigation of this matter is believed
| warranted at this time.
