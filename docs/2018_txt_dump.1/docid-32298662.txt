“in Havana, Cuba and was approached by Cuban officials con-
cerning the possibility of getting LANZ to Cuba. The
informant is alleged to have related that he would not get
involved, but informed the Cuban officials he knew a person
who would be interested and who could possibly accomplish

\' the mission. Informant advised a representative from.Cuba
& is scheduled to arrive in Miami on December 4, 1959, to

Yard, Havana, Cuba. SALAZAR and DELGADO mentioned to him
_the possibility of getting DIAZ LANZ out of the United States
into Cuba. McCRORY told them he would have nothing to do
with such a matter but thought it could be done upon pay-
ment of a sufficient sum of money and that he knows a person
who would be Anterested; he would put them in contact with
this individdal. The individual referred to is JACK BROWN,
whose identity should not be disclosed, who is a deep sea .
diver and operates an advertising business in Marathon,  -
Florida. BROWN owns a sea plane and a PT boat.

McGRORY advised he discussed the matter with

JACKKBROWN and it was agreed between them that no effort
would be made to contact LANZ, but that an effort would be
made to have the Cuban:government pay a large sum of money
in advance upon the belief that BROWN would undertake the

job. . \

He advised that under no circumstances should
BROWN be informed that the matter has been reported, as
BROWN then probably would not endeavor to détermine the
complete plan from the Cuban officials. McCRORY related

he can control BROWN and, if necessary, he believes he
could induce . BROWN to testify.

     
 

‘On December 2, 1959, McGRORY and BROWN had a F4AZ, 4
telephonic conversation with scapes and an agreement we
was made whereby a representative would arrive at Key West,
Florida, on the first’ Cubana plane on the morning of Decem-

ber 4, 1959.. BROWN was to meet the Cuban representative in

the airport manager's office, which upon reflection McCRORY
believed to be not'feasible as BROWN is well known to the
airport manager.

McCRORY called SALAZAR on December 3, 1959, and
outlined the danger of having such a meeting in Key West, _
and suggested the representative come to Miami. This change .’
