best position of anyone to possibly obtain information concern

if any information received concerning this subject. There is

also being used as an informant in the Phoenix Division the J
personal physician of JOSEPH BONANNO, who is carried as a Potential’

Cc iminal Informant, T. -E. A. VON DENROTH, M.D. Phoenix Division
