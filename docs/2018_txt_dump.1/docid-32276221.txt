 

On the other hand, this same geographic situation
makes clandestine entry and exit reasonably simple.
(There are 3,825 linear miles of essentially unpa-
trolled Central American coastline, within 175 to
850:miles from Cuba. There are at least .93 airfields,
other than ours, within 700 miles of the island, and
the ships and craft indigenous to the Caribbean, and
‘capable of supporting the subversive ebb and flow,-
number well into the thousands,

Even in the face of these unfavorable factors, a
program of direct restraints, selected from among
the actions enumerated herein, can have favorable
effects, Under the proposed steps some travel would
be stopped completely. More - probably much more -
would be rendered difficult, Some hitherto legal
movement would be driven underground, Previous ©
clandestine movement would be impeded, complicated

and-harassed t6 the point where it becomes more
costly, more uncertain, more hagardous and thus,
hopefully, less extensive,

Il. Nature and Scope of the Problem

We do not know enough about the movement of
subversive trainees, into Cuba: and - more important. ~
out of Cuba, We do not know enough about the volume
of travel, or the media employed, This is par-
ticularly true in the area of illicit traffic, where
our knowledge is extremely limited.

Regarding legal travel to Cuba, CIA presents the
following estimate:

* In transit, including about 300 Mexicans

While some of these travellers proceeded to Cuba by
other routes, the great majority passed through Mexico,
On the most conservative basis, then, it will be seen
that there cannot have been fewer than 4,912 travellers
to Cuba during 1962, while the average monthly number ~
passing through Mexico for the first two months of
1963 is even higher than the 1962 monthly average.

 

Of the total number visiting Cuba, the Central
Intelligence Agency estimates that at least 1,500, and
perhaps as many as 2,000;have received ideological
indoctrination or guerrilla warfare training, Many

CUBA

THE MOVEMENT OF SUBVERSIVES AND SUBVERSIVE TRAINEES

IT. Introduction

 

The actions proposed herein are designed to impede
the flow of subversives between Cuba and other Latin
American. countries, Execution of any one or more of
the enumerated actions will ameliorate the situation;
execution of them all will not completely solve it,
The practical problems involved are too numerous and
complex. —

 

With respect to diminishing legal travel to Cuba, _
we face multiple problems in the policies and attitudes
of those Latin American countries through which the
subversive traveller must pass. From the viewpoint of
these nations the direct actions required have strong

» political and sometimes legal implications - impli-
cations which eannot be overcome easily, even when -
the leaders of these countries choose to do so,

 

 

   

; in the matter of clandestine travel, we are :
confronted not only with the great depth of communist
- guile, born of two generations of experience in the
pe international movement of subversives, but with the
a inexperience, ineptitude and lack of awareness in
ae these same matters on the part of the Latin American
community. ;

 

In spite of this, the advantages do not all reside —

with the communists. Cuba's insular character imposes —

certain sharp limitations upon personal movement.

Cuba has no frentiers with other states; everyone

who enters the country must do so either by water, :

or air, There can be no slipping through the «
barbed wire, ;
