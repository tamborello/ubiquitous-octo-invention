gambling in another section of the country. He said that in
spite of all these statements he knew that the FBI and other
governmental agencies would not believe him; however, there was
no way that he could prove his statements.

SA ROBERT A. VOEGE regarding his connection with the MAFIA.
The results of this interview were reported previously in this
report.

VOEGE on February ©7, 1958, regarding JOHN LA ROCCA. MESSER
said that LA ROCCA used to be in the numbers in. the East Liberty
area along with him and on one occasion LA ROCCA went to
Chicago, Ill., whereupon MESSER moved into the East Liberty
area and took over the entire numbers operation. When LAPROCGA
returned from Chicago, he became angry with MESSER and had a

ear run over him one night when he was crossing the street.

When MESSER got out of the hospital he said he found his
automobile had numerous bullet holes in it. :
MESSER said that later he and LA ROCCA ended their feud and in
approximately 1943, LA ROCCA invited him to share equally in
the ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company,

5746 Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh. MESSER advised that this
company did well financially until the Allegheny County
authorities raided the establishments where the coin machines
were located.

to give the dissenters a "going over" while upsetting their
equipment. MESSER said the job was done for STIRONE by
MANNARINO who became incensed when he learned his gorillas had .
hurt some older Italian men. MESSER said MANNARINO was under
the impression that the men who had defied STIRONE were "young
punks" and he let STIRONE know what he thought of him in front

‘ On May 11, 1953, during an interview with JOHN LA ROCCA

in connection with an official matter, the subject of
the Mafia came up and LA ROCCA advised SA JOHN S. PORTELLA
as follows: . .

He denied current or past existence in the United States

of any organization known as the Black Hand or Mafia.

He said Sicilians who had come to the United States had
congregated in certain communities in the same fashion as

had Irish and other nationality groups, because of similarities
of ‘interests and backgrounds. These communities had

naturally given rise to social, fraternal and civic groups

and. members of such groups as a matter of course assisted

other members who were in ay sort of trouble. The tactics ‘
used in some instances to achieve the ends desired by some \
of these groups were not always according to the letter of the

law, but they were generally more effective. In any group ;
there are those who refuse to work for a living and sometimes
resort to extorting a livelihood from anyone who could be
frightened or terrorized. In an Italian community these

few would naturally be referred to as the Black Hand or
Mafia because of the history of similar activities on’ the
