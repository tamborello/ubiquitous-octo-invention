; a, On the basis of a request to the Station from the ©
- ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sént to Puebla to be an: ;
eyewitness to the 4 June 1961. Catholic inspired anti-CASTRO ©
demonstrations. Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired. |...
“information, and samples of many of the leaflets used, but he
prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give
the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs., 5June 1961;
SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment -
‘due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively: .

b. SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that a,
Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local
_ Mexico City address, . This case has been of considerable
counterespionage interest to Headquarters.

- c, SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the ~
Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by periodic interviews with ; o,
the subject's neighbors and associates, . a ie

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,
and surveillances."" SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both .
directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below: —

a, - SCANTLING devoted a lot of ti
surveillance and attempted recruitment of a
Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy. SCANTLING -
talked a times and undoubtedly was
primarily responsible for the later success 3 of the recruitment
made by another Station agent. -

 

‘b. Some additional time was devoted to the Cesar - . eo
GONZALEZ Sanchez case in February 1961 when SCANTLING
determined that GONZALEZ was still in-Mexico City. See
the last renewal for additional deta ils on this case,

 

   

 

2 eh En connect ion ‘with the ‘above’ objective SCANTLING
has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood investigations
for the Station. SCANTLING also does most of the local

investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE
components,

d, .SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and
August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance
training to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey. Although
this is not a direct contribution to the above objective, it
is considered sufficiently related to mention here, -

4, In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,
SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the
Station, For example, SCANTLING is now handling LIEMBROIL-2 and
will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962. Also,

during the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance

team until July 1961 when Simon D, CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico
City. SCANTLING is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments

’ for other Station opérations,

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely -
fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and
valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to
other Station activities in general, SCANTLING's production, measured -

against monetary expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors, _

unquestionably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project -
LIEMPTY. :

B. Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project -

object ves):

described in the 1960 Request for Project Renewal.

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to ‘LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic base houses,"

‘Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute -

to this objective. To avoid repetition, the Station is om itting the. usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute -
to the above objective. There has been no change in the coverage as

 

. 2, "To collect operational informati ion and identity operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity."' The LIENTRAP
operation, handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this

Review of Project LIEMPTY ps

(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

i CURRENT. OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

-- Ay Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to Project
objectives):

1. “To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities," SCANTLING has continued (See the
last two Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-14093,

13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18 November 1960) to provide
worthwhile information pertaining to this objective,

a. During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be
used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY.. For example, oy
operational information recently indicated that the LIMERICK — _
target was using the services of a Mexico City firm to repair
safes. ‘Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to
identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner in the
event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to
exploit this information in another. manner.

 

b, SCANTLING is still the Station’s primary source for
keeping current records on the residences.of the many LIMERICK
personnel in Mexico City. This is accomplished in several ways;
the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIENVOY

- leads which indicate the LIMERICK people are interested in -
renting a given piece of property. (See Previous project. renewal _
request for additional details), ; . :

2. "To collect operational information pertaining to. other. targets
of opportunity,. foreign Official installations and personnel of intelligence -
interest operating in Mexico." SCANTLING is very useful for collecting |
information on other Station targets:
