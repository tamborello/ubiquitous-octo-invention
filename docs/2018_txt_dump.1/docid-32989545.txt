This memorandum advises of demonstrations being scheduled in
Washington, D, C., and San Francisco, California, on 11/20/71 to build
public support for the repeal of antiabortion laws.

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition was formed at a
conférence held at Columbia University, New York City, in July, 1971, which
was attended by approximately 1,000 women from 29 states. The conference
voted to make a woman's right to abortion a national and political issue.
Subsequent to “its formation, the coalition called for demonstrations in Z
San Francisco and Washington on 11/20/71 to build public support for the
repeal of all antiabortion laws, to protest forced sterilization, andtocall ~ “es
for an end to restrictive contraceptive laws. A source of the Washington ,
Field Office has advised that the march in Washington is supported by the

: Young Socialist Alliance, the youth group of the Socialist Workers Party BC.
* (SWP). Caroy/ipman, who is a member of the SWP, is Project Director ~
of the Washington march.

Coalition leaders in reauesting permit for the demonstration have
iestimated that participation in the Washington march will range between
{10,000 and 20,000 persons. The Washington Field Office has developed

information that 46 buses have been chartered to bring participants to the
demonstration. Participants will represent some 80 cities. The Metropolitan
Police Department anticipates participation will be in the vicinity of 5, 5 eae person:
