During the course of investigation of FRANK FIDELE

CORBI, Baltimore file 92-175, Bureau file 92-3621, efforts ~
have been made to establish a headquarters from which CORBI
operates in order that a highly confidential source concerning
him can be developed; Surveillances and information from
informants has indicated that CORBI travels a great deal around
the Baltimore Metropolitan area frequently conducting his bus-
iness in public restaurants and on the sidewalk. PCI JOHN
GAMBINO has now succeeded in securing employment by CORBI
as night bartender at Kathleen's Musical Bar which is owned
and operated by CORBI..at 612 E..Baltimore Street. GAMBINO
has already been able to fumnish information concerning

- visitors to CORBI in an apartment above CORBI's restaurant”

occupied by a relative of CORBI's, MARY. PURCELL, .
