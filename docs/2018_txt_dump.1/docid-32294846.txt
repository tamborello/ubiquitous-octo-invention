Following set forth in view Philadiphia contemplated
interview with ALLEN:

; On 5/12/61, PSI JOSE M. NOUEL Y SIMPSON, whose
identity must be protected, advised SA C. GRAHAM HURST and SA
} CHARLES W. EDMISTON that he is only able to furnish info of a
! personal knowledge of events that of@urred in the Dominican
Republic (DR) during 1958 and prior to that time. He stated
in about 1953, the Fair opened in Ciudad Trujillo, Dé.R. which
included exhibition buildings and amustment park. Amusement
park was called Coney Island. As PSI recalls, man named
HAMMOND or HANNA, from Atlantic City, N. J. who rented and
sold circus equipment, a man named BUCKY ALLEN, and JOE MANGONE,
prought the ferriswheel and other amusement equipment to D. R.
and sold it to govt. ‘These three men then leased Coney Island
from the govt. for $9,000.00 a month.

This included gambling casfnos which had black jack,
roulette and other games of chance. Gambling casinos were
subsequently leased out by these men to several different
people at different times. HAMMOND, after a short time,
disassociated himself from ALLEN and MANGONE.

ALLEN and MANGONE continued to lease Coney Island
until about 1957 when MANGONE left the business. PSI said
MANGONE pulled out because of small profits in Coney Island
operation which were not enough for two people, MANGONE did
operate an amusement park at NW 79th St. and 27th Ave., Miami
and at present lives in an apartment building on south end of
Miami Béach.

PSI said ALLEN did live in Allentown, Pa. and subsequently
in trailer park on 89th St., Miami; although he heard more
recently AELENSLivesiin Miami Shores.

PSI said neither ALLEN nor MANGONE spent all of their
time in D.R. operating Coney Island, but they had as their
manager who operated for them a man known to PSI as NORMAN (LNU).
PSI believes NORMAN still runs Coney Island for ALLEN. He
described NORMAN (LNU) as white male, age 50-55, 5!10", 200 lbs.,
heavy build, wore tourtoise shell glasses, had big hands and
big head, considers roustabout person. ;

NORMAN had 7 or 8 Americans working under him and
15 - 20 D.R. Nationals who cleaned up the grounds. :

PSI is not familiar with name NORMAN FROMKIN and
cannot say if NORMAN (LNU) is identical with FROMKIN. PSI
pelieves NORMAN still is in D.R. and ALLEN travels most of the
time with a-carnival or circus, name. unknown to PSI.

Photo of ANGELO. BRUNO was identified by PSI as a man
whose name he did not know who he saw one time in D.R. with
ALLEN and MANGONE in about 1957, and about the same time MANGONE
pulled out of the Coney Island operation. PSI, at that time,
attempted to learn BRUNO's name from ALLEN and MANGONE, but
met with no success. :

PSI said that even without his knowing the degree of
association between ALLEN and MANGONE and BRUNO, it was quite
apparent that BRUNO: made the decisions in conversations between
the three of them during the brief time PSI had occasion to
be in their presence, These decisions had to do with the
operation of Coney Island. PSI has heard at present there is
little or no business at Coney Island because of lack of tourist
trade and also native children have long ago become tired of the
fair.

PSI stated there were always slot machines in casinos
in D.R. but he heard in the past year slot machines are on every
street corner and in every store. PSI heard these machines
were put there by ALLEN and VIRGILIO ALVAREZ PINA, aka. “Cucho",
who is Secretary of the Interior in D.R.

Miami has in dictation a report which sets forth in
detail ALLEN's contact with Miami FBI in 2/60, at-which time
he advised as a matter of info, of two shipments of slot machines
he was sending to D.R. addressed to Secretary of State, Minister
of Interior and Communications. Subsequently, independent info
received on 3/14/60, that some slot machines destined for D.R.
were at Miami Internation&l Airport. Investigation located 14
slot machines being sent to."Secretarie de estado Interio y
Cultas, Coney Island, Ciudad Trujillo, D. R." with consignor
as Triangle Distributors, 15 Olney St., Providence, Rhode Island.
