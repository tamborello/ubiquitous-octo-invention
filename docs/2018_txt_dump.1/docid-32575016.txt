a Federal Grand Jury in the Southern District of New York '
inquiring into the significance of the conference of , !
hoodlums at Apalachin, New York, 11/14/57. As a matter of i
information, Senator JOHN MC CLELLAN, Chairman of the U. S. ;
Senate Select ‘Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor ‘
or Management Field, has issued statements to the press that ~
he considers GABRIEL MANNARINO one of the most important :
witnesses yet to be heard by the committee. Since MANNARINO's
disappearance from New Kensington in 12/57 various reports

have been-received that MANNARINO and LA ROCCA are hiding.

out together.

 

In connection with efforts to identify the location of the
hunting lodge PG 545-C-on 10/28/58 learned through JACK
KRUPA, a New Kensington, Pa., councilman and life-long friend
and hunting companion of the MANNARINO brothers, that SAM —
‘MANNARINO's hunting’ lodge is. not located in Somerset County,
Pa., but, is actually a twenty room farm house ‘generally
referred to as a hunting lodge surrounded by approximately .
200 acres of densely wooded land in Pennsylvania near the
Pennsylvania-Maryland border approximately a fifteen minute
drive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland, . PG 545-C :
‘was unable to obtain any additional identifying information:
because of the likelihood of arising KRUPA's suspicions.”

 

> ‘Examination of available maps of the area indicate that o
the hunting lodge must be located in Franklin County
probably in the general vicinity of Waynesboro and : :
Greencastle, Pa. ;

PG 545-C also recalled that he was in SAM MANNARINO's office
at the Ken Iron and Steel Company, New Kensington, during ‘
12/57, when the press and radio carried the first accounts - r
of MANNARINO being called before the Federal Grand Jury |
in New York. Informant stated that while he was at the
office Deputy Marshals were attempting to locate GABRIEL '
MANNARINO when his brother SAM rec@ived a phone call from
’ GABRIEL MANNARINO and hurriedly told him "They are trying
- to serve you with a subpoena, take off for the prush."
PG. 545-C said that in view of MANNARINO's prolonged
‘disappearance. it seems: logical to assume that if SAM
MANNARINO's remarks--were interpreted literally his
advice "take off for the brush" could have been his subtle !

way of telling GABRIEL to hide. outsat the hunting lodge.
With respect to background. “information concerning the lodge»

or farm house near the. Maryland border’ PG 5A5—-C pointed
out. that KRUPA. who has been a’ “frequent: visitor to the location

‘ gola-him that. SAM MANNARINO has several. four wheel -

drive: trucks .and other heavy equipment parked on the ‘ ,
property that are used from time to time by some of the

local residents. Informant said that according to. KRUPA

the general area is thickly populated with whiskey

stills and that local game wardens are reluctant to

enter the area.apparently because’ some of them have been
mistaken for ATU Agents and fired upon by moonshiners.

PG’ 545-C:also developed from KRUPA that occasionally ‘while

on hunting trips with.SAM MANNARINO they would stay in a hotel
in-a nearby town (possibly Waynesboro) instead of” “Sleeping
over night at the farm house.

Philadelphia through Recorder. of. Deeds: for Franklin County, | \
Pa., attempt to.identify the 200 acres of land and hunting”

recorded in MANNARINO's name, however, if county records.
