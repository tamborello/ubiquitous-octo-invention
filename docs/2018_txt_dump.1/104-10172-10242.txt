DISPATCHES AGENT, WE STATED THAT THIS WAS CONSIOERLO EXTREMELY
UNLIKELY IN VIEW OF THE INFO Hi HAD PROVIDED. THE KGB WOULD
NOT HAVE NEEDED TO PAY “SUCH A HIGH PRICE IN COMPROMISED. AGENTS
AND OPERATIONS $F THEY WANTEO TO FEED US A PHONY OLFECTOR. WE
ALSO MADE THE UNSUBTLE SUGGESTION THAT THE KGB DION'T NEED TO SEND
us AN AELADLE TO GET INFO ON(UPHI LL INTERNAL SECURITY PROBLEMS.

¥. WE FINO THE OPINIONS REPORTED IN RESS A BIT DISTURBING.
WHILE WE DO NOT SUGGEST A PCINTED ANG DETAILED REBUTTAL AT THES
TIME, ET ES REQUESTED THAT ANY FUTURE EXPRESSIONS OF THIS TYPE
BE FERMLY COUNTERED WITH A REITERATION OF OUR PREVIOUS STATE-

A. AELADLE ADMITTEDLY HAD LITTLE INFO ON KGB OPS IN
GERMANY INASMUCH AS HE WAS NEVER DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED
WITH KGB GERMAN OPS. THIS POINT WAS MADE CLEAR FROM

B. AELADLE PROVIDEO A WEALTH OF INFO ON MATTERS CONCERNIN
OTHER AREAS WHICH HAS CHECKED OUT WITH INFO AVAILABLE
FROM OTHER SOURCES. THIS INCLUDEO INFO ON THE VASSAL
CASE. WHILE WE 00 NOT WISH TO CITE STATISTICS OR
SPECIFIC CASES, FOR OBVIOUS SECURITY AND POLITICAL
REASONS, IT §S THE OPINION OF NOT ONLY KUBARK Cl
EXPERTS, BUT OF OTHERS, THAT: AELADLE'S INFO IS

©. THAT HE WAS A HANDLING PROBLEM WAS MADE CLEAR FROM
