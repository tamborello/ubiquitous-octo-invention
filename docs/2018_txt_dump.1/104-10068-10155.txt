1. The SMABOVES are still bombarding the Station (although
the volume has diminished) with trace requests on correspondents
of Subject. The Station has several times made clear our feel-
ing that wholesale tracing of AEVALIANT/1 contacts two and three tim
removed is a poor expenditure of effort, put the requests still

continue to come.

2. The latest request received on 13 February 1963 relates
to the following:

19 Jan 63 Sankei Bussan Co. Ltd., :
P.O. Box 213, Kobe Port, :
Hyogo Pref. Japan :

21 Jan 63 Universal - W.E. Polna
Poland

25 Jan 63 Svenska Bindgarn Sfabrikens,
Stockholm, Sweden

 

3. In view of the above, the Station will appreciate the
"review and reevaluation of the AEVALIANT case" which has been
discussed on several occasions in the past and which would have
as its objective "the resolution of outstanding leads and the
termination of active investigations of this case". The Station| |
believes that until KUBARK takes a firm position and provides
guidance in this respect, the SMABOVES will continue to expend
their limited investigative assets on the wide range of AEVALIANT
personalities at the expense of more current and more potentially

productive activities. .
