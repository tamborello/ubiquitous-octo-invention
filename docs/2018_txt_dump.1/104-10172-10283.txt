On 21 May[VALINK/1) was informed by GOLUB that he (G,) had been surmoned to
Leningrad for a atg w/a repn of the Soviet Internal Security Police (presumably
MVD). While there, GOLUB had beon instructed to determine what security peocaution
the Police of Sweden, Norway and Denmark plan to take to insure the safety of —
KARUSHCHEY during his August visit to the Sean countries, During the conversation,
G, was very oritical of his Soviet colleagues in Stos, Oslo ani Cope, for their
failure to develop close relations w/repna of the Security Police of those -

requested, but also.for the safety of K. during this trip. G. did not know
for aure whther K. would visit Finland on this trip, but believed that if he did,
it vould occur after the visit to the other 3 sommirieny and. that any visit to
