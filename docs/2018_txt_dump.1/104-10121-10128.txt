REVOCATION OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC CLEARANCE

DEBRIEFING STATEMENT

 

1. TI, David S. Morales

have been informed that my CIA cryptographic clearance has been
revoked effective this date.

 

2. J understand that revocation of my cryptographic clearance
pars me automatically from further access to CIA staff cryptographic
material or information, but that it does not release me from my
obligation to protect the security of cryptographic information, the
knowledge of which I mignt still retain. I shall continue to protect
that information to the best of my ability, and I shall likewise pro-
tect the cryptographic information of other U.-.S. Government agencies
should TI have knowledge of that information.

3. I have read the provisions of Public Law 513 of 13 May 1950.
I understand that I am bound by that Act even after the revocation of
my cryptographic clearance and my termination from CIA, and that im-
~ proper disclosure of cryptographic information could subject me to pun-
ishment under the provisions of the Act.

4. I certify that no CIA staff cryptographic material remains in
my possession.

David S. Morales (in absentia)
