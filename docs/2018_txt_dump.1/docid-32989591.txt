The Honorable Edward H. Levi ALL IPORMATION CONT.
The Attorney General : Pane bal px aed)
Washington, D.C. 20530 i. Ineo

Dear Mr. Levi:

I would like to thank you for thé courtesy you extended
by promptly responding to my request to see you. Your action
exemplified the spirit of cooperation between the Executive
and Congress which prompted my request,

I do feel that my concern that the FBI clear for release
the documents with which I was concerned deserves your seri-
ous attention, While I am aware that the release of the docu-
ments may confirm the identity of a former FBI informant, I
feel the posture the Bureau has taken in publicly denying that
the events described in the documents ever took place neces-
sitates their release, if only to set the record straight, It
should be noted that the Bureau's public position in this situ-
ation, as well as in others, has been taken in direct response
to public statements I have made critical of past improper FBI
activities, Accordingly, it is the confirmation of improper
FBI activity, instead of the identity of the informant, with
which I am concerned. Further, it is my feeling that, based
on information I have received, the identity of the informant
is already common knowledge.

The other group of documents for which I sought release
concern FBI actions taken against the Black Panther Party in
North Carolina, These in no way involve a confidential source,
and I anticipate no problems with their clearance. Under sep-
arate cover I am furnishing Mr. Steve Blackhurst copies of the
documents for which I seek cléarance.

Again, let me express my appreciation to you for your as-
Sincerely,

It is noted the Cardinal was released from the
hospital on 5/5/76 where he had been recovering from the
removal of his gall bladder. SA HART has been the liaison
between the Chicago Office and the Cardinal since 1966
and has developed a friendly personal working relationship
with him,

Attached as the last page of this airtel is a
copy of an article which appeared in the 5/6/76 edition
of the Chicago Daily News. In view of the quality of the
xeroxing the last sentences at the bottom of the first two
columns are repeated hereafter:

Column 1,

"Cardinal Cody is convalescing in Chicago's
Columbus Hospital after April 25 gall bladder surgery
and couldn't be reached directly for comment, but a
spokesman for the archdiocese quoted the Cardinal as
saying the committee's report is “absolutely untrue.'"

Column 2

"Wednesday to accompany its monumental two
volumes released last week on the nation's domestic and
foreign intelligence operations.

"The supplement is the second of 13 such
volumes of detail on the committee's schedule."

For information.
