On September 17, 1963, SJ T-1, a Cuban exile (7)
residing in Puerto Rico, who is in a position to know |
certain aspects of Cuban and Haitian activity in Puerto
Rico, advised he had learned that the JURE had held a
elebration on September 15, 1963, at Juana Diaz, Puerto
Rico, commemorating the first anniversary of the JURE. ~

At this celebration the JURE announced the signing of a pact
for mutual help with the Fuerzas Unificadas de Liberacion
Haitiana (Unified Forces for the Liberation of Haiti) (FUL).
The purpose of the signing of this pact was for one or

‘the other group to lend its assistance when Cuba or Haiti

is liberated from their respective governments. ~

The September 17, 1963, issue of "El Mundo", a
daily San Juan, Puerto Rico, Spanish language newspaper,
carried an article entitled "Cuban Group signs Pact with
Haitians", This article indicated in part that the
first anniversary of JURE had been celebrated on
September 15, 1963 at Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico. At this
celebration, EMILIO GUEDE, chief of propaganda for JURE,
announced the signing of a pact ’of mutual help between .
the FUL and JURE in order that when one or the other, Cuba
or Haiti, is free from dictatorship, the other would help in
the fight for liberation. Mr. GUEDE told "El Mundo" that
the pact had been signed about one month ago by MANUEL
RAY and Dr. ROLANDO AGRAMONTE, secretary of exterior
relations, both of JURE, and PAUL VERNA and GEORGES LACOMBE
of the FUL. It was indicated that VERNA was from Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic, and LACOMBE from San Juan,
Puerto Rico and that both are Haitians.

On September 15, 1963, the JURE held its first

September 15, 1963. At this meeting it was announced
that a pact of mutual assistance had been recently signed
between the JURE and FUL. This pact, entitled "To Public
Opinion of the Free World", consists of denunciations of ;
the current Cuban and Haitian dictatorships, branding them
as Communist. The last paragraph of this pact indicates
that the JURE and FUL agree that should one or the
other, Cuban or Haitian, governments fall, the other
will consider the fight for the other's independence as
an "extension" of their fight for liberation and lend all
help possible to bring about the overthrow of the existing
dictatorship.

SJ T-2 advised that the only Haitian group known
to be presently operating in Puerto Rico is the FUL which
was organized on August 12, 1963. The membership of this
organization at present consists of three persons, namely
GEORGES LACOMBE, FREDRIC BESSON, and RAYMOND CHAMPANA, all
Haitians residing in Puerto Rico. BESSON and CHAMPANA have
not been active in the FUL nor have they indicated any
desire to do so.

LACOMBE stated the FUL has no funds with which
to operate and has no memkership other than in Puerto

he is an opportunist and that the FUL is a "paper ©
organization". As he pointed out, the number of Haitians
in Puerto Rico limits: any Haitian group attempting to —
establish itself in Puerto Rico. During a previous
interview with JOSE ERNESTO MUZAURIETA, F O8g 7-1), he

stated that he had originally hired LACOMBE as a supervisor
but as a result of his poor work he reduced him to the
