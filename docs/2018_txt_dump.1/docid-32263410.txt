Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Ambassador, what was your position in
1963 when you were with the CIA?
Mr. Helms. In 1963, I had the title Deputy Director for
Plans.
Mr. Goldsmith. Would you explain to the Committee what
the organization function of the Deputy Director for Plans was

| in 1963?

| Mr. Helms. In 1963, the Deputy Director for Plans was
, the Deputy Director who was in charge of -- I guess the simple

term is overseas operations. This entity of the CIA received

| dts mandate from two documents, one known as MSC No. 5 and
| the other CID/2 or M-12.

In any event, the responsibility of this unit was to

side the continental limits«of the United States.

Mr. Goldsmith. Can you describe generally what your

responsibilities were as head of that unit?
Mr. Helmsv..-- I was, in fact, in charge of the unit. In

other words, I was under the aegis of the Director of Central

| operations.

investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy?

Mr. Helms. Béter this tragedy occurred and the Warren
Commission was formed, there was every effort made in the
Central Intelligence Agency to be as responsive as possible
to request/ from the FBI who was conducting the investigation
or a major portion of it, and the staff and members of the
Warren Commission. .

I would like to take this occasion to say we were all, I
think, in this country equally struck with the tragic circun-
stances and we all felt, in the Agency, that we should do what
we could to be as supportive as we possibly could of these,
other entities that had the lead in this investigation.

Mr. Goldsmith. Am I correct in assuming that -- and under-
standyyour testimony to be -- that the basic role of the Agency
at that time was to lend support to the FBI and to the Warren
Commission? | |

Mr. Helms. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Functioning in that capacity, how was the
CIA's investigation organized? .

Mr. Helms. This is a long time ago that these events took
place. I guess it is all of 15 years.

I do not recall. that, at the outset, that there was any
formal organizational change made to accommodate this investi-
gation. My recollection is that we figured that most of our

contribution would focus on what had occurred in Mexico City --

The Chaix will ask the witness if he will be sworn at this
time.

Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to

Mr. Helms. I do, Mrs Chairman.

Mr. Preyer. You may be seated.

As we do to all witnesses, the Chair will give a brief
statement concerning the subject of the investigation.

House Resolution 222 mandates the Committee to conduct a
full and complete investigation and study of the circumstances
surrounding the assassination and death of President John F.
Kennedy including determining whether the existing laws of the
United States concerning the investigation of the President =
and the investigatory jurisdiction and capability of agencies
and departments are adequate in their provisions and enforce-

ment and there is full disclosure of evidence and information

among agencies and departments of the United States government, |

and whether any evidence or information not in the possession

of anagency or department would have been in assistance in

_ investigating the assassination, and why such information was

not provided by such agency or department; and to make recom-
mendations to the House, if the Select Committee deems it

appropriate, for amendment of existing legislation or the
