OLC- 78-4078/4
19 October 1978

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT : Willard Galbraith

1. Barney Hidalgo, when interviewed yesterday,
raised the possibility that the composite sketch shown
him by HSCA representatives as "Maurice Bishop" may have
looked somewhat like a former chief of his, Willard
Galbraith. Hidalgo believes that Galbraith is now
deceased,

2. The Office of Personnel file on Galbraith shows
his date of birth as 1906. He was an FSO from 1929
until he joined CIA in 1952. He retired from CIA in
February 1962.

3. During the period that Galbraith might have
been involved in anything--if he was--associated with

Cuban oper ons, etc., his assignments
been inp Bron 1957 to 1959, an b-32
from 19 retired in February 1 7 rs

to have retired to Los Angeles, the address from which
his early retirement letters originated.

4, While the OPF did not contain a photograph of
Mr. Galbraith he is not likely to have been engaged in
whatever activities a man using the name of Maurice Bishop
is alleged to have been in during 1963.
