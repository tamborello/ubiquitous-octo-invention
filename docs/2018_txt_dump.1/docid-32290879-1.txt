ReBulet 12/26/62.

In order to afford visual .as well as technical
coverage of the residence of JOSEPH RAYMOND DIEZ, 4951
Puritan Road, Tampa, Florida, “it has been desirable in the
past to obtain the rental of a rental property at 4603 River
Hills Drive, Tampa, which is owned by WILBUR A. KRAUSE, former oe
PCI of Tampa Office. However, the property on River Hills eye
Drive has been rented and unavailable to the Tampa Office. .

Mr. KRAUSE has recently advised that the property
on River Hills Drive is now available and he would be willing
to rent it to the Bureau on a monthly basis at the rate of
$115.00 a month, which would include water, electricity, heat
and furnishings. It was pointed out to him that the Tampa
Office, should the property be needed, might wish to dis=
continue it after a month, and he advised that this would be’
Satisfactory to him and any period beyond one month would be .
payable on a weekly basis. He stated further that he would
provide fifty gallons of fuel for the heating unit, which
should be more than enough to last fora period of seven to
eight weeks. In this regard, he said that should additional 2
heat be needed, the Tampa Office could pay for additional fuel ©
oil; however, there would be little likelihood of needing

TP 66-231-sub 4.

As the Bureau is aware, Agents in contact with. -
TP 79-C* are presently utilizing a shack on the premises
of 5114 Puritan Road, Tampa, and this property does not
allow visual observation of the residence of DIEZ. Should
the property On River Hills Drive be rented, the Tampa Office
would move the. ‘plant from 5114 Puritan Road to the River :
Hills Drive address, and in this manner fuller coverage .
could be given to DIEZ.

CONF. INFT. . Bureau authority is requested to spend $115. 00
for a one-month period and a pro-rata sum thereafter for.
as long as TP_79-C* is activated, for rental of the

gle residence at 4603 River Hills Drive.
=

 

If Bureau authority is given, the plant will be
moved as set out above, with full security.
