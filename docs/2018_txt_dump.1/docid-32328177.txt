EWING stated he had “just returned" from a trip to 4%
Havana, Cuba, where he was shown around for "a few days" by ed
JAKE LANSKY. . (LANSKY is a Miami Top Hoodlum.) He said LANSKY }
has an interest in the Riviera Hotel in Havana, and spends
most of his time in‘Cuba, Ye .

. Regarding the slot machine operation in that country
he stated the government gets 30 % of the take from the slot
machines and government agents carry the keys, There was also
a 30% import on machines going into Cuba until a short time AZO. fis
Recently a law was passed prohibiting the import into the coun- ‘e
try of any machines, The reason behind this, according to EWING;:
was that the gambling figures in Havana had "more or less" given <"
the Tropicana Hotel to the government group that controls gambling
This was to keep them happy and keep the pressure off the other Ve
places. The Tropicana had all three-wheel machines. The Hilton v0
Hotel started .to ship in some four-wheel machines and these were
drawing business away from the Tropicana. Consequently the
brother-in-law of the president of Cuba, who is spokésman for
the government group, arranged for passage of the restictive Py

the company’s Miami Office, GONZALES said he was getting in
thirty new machines from the#ennings Manufacturing-—Company in

tee Chicago. EWING asked him how he was getting around the import
law and GONZALES stated this law "is for the peons."

EWING stated the owners of the Hilton Hotel tried to
persuade him to come to Havana and set up & factory to manu-
facture slot machines, He said he is not going to set up this
plant because of the unsettled political situation in Cuba.

He said he did line up a few contracts and may make some equip-
ment in addition to the thirty devices ordered by the Hilton,

EWING said government officials from the collectors
on up are getting "fat" from Havana gambling and he is convinced
that as soon as they learn enough to run the show themselves,
they will kkk everyone else out of the country.
