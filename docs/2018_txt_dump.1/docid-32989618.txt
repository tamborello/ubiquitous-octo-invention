Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

Inquiry of Intelligence Division personnel, who
might have pertinent information, developed the following
information which might be offered to Mr. Ulman: (1) The
only specific instance in which we are aware that the AG is
involved in consideration or approval of activities of the
FBI regarding foreign intelligence is that when we desire to
effect electronic coverage, for ourselves or on request of
another agency, for the purpose of obtaining positive foreign
intelligence information or foreign counterintelligence
purposes, we seek the approval of the AG. Other agencies
might do likewise. (2) The National Security Act of 1947,
approved by the President 7/26/47, created the National Security
Council (NSC). NSC Intelligence Dineétive (NSCID) No. 1 was
revised on 7/7/49 and added the FBI as a member of the oe
Intelligence Advisory Committee (IAC). By a subsequent revision
of NSCID No. 1 on 9/15/58, IAC became the United States
Intelligence Board (USIB), with the FBI still a member, USIB
concerns itself with foreign intelligence matters, However,
inasmuch as the FBI itself is a member of USIB, and historically
the FBI has not coordinated USIB matters with the AG} the ‘
Bureau's role in USIB is not considered pertinent to the
inquiry regarding the involvement of the AG in foreign intelligence
matters. (3) Our records indicate that prior to the establishment
of the NSC, former FBI Director Hoover recommended that the
AG be a member of the committee which later became the NSC.
Apparently the National Security Act of 1947 did provide for
the AG to attend NSC meetings as a member if the President so
desired, Our records indicate the AG did attend some NSC
meetings as a member during the 1947-48 period. However, by
memorandum 8/19/49, AAG Peyton Ford informed Mr. Hoover that
the AG could no longer attend NSC meetings as a member because
of the amendment to the National Security Act made by Section 3
of Public Law 216, 81st Congress, approved 8/10/49. (4) On ‘
11/5/71, the White House announced the establishment of the

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75 .
62-116395

National Security Council Intelligence Committee (NSCIC)

with the AG as a member, The President's 11/5/71 memorandum
stated the NSCIC "will give direction and guidance on national
substantive intelligence needs and provide for a continuing
evaluation of intelligence products ‘from the viewpoint of the
intelligence consumer.' Assistant AG Robert Mardian attended

a meeting of NSCIC on 12/14/71 as the AG's representative.

We cannot document it, but the recollection of FBI personnel
involved in NSCIC affairs is that Mr. Mardian reported thereafter
to the AG that NSCIC activities did not concern the Department
and that neither the AG ror Mardian were subsequently involved
in NSCIC affairs. On 4/24/74, the AG was still listed as a
member of NSCIC., However, in August, 1974, FBI inquiry of a
member of the U. S. intelligence committee staff elicited the
opinion that the AG was no longer considered to be a member

of NSCIC because the AG's office had not been participating in
NSCIC affairs or attending its meetings; further, the AG was

not among the addressees of papers being sent out in preparation

for the next NSCIC meeting. However, it appears that the AG

may still be nominally listed as a member of NSCIC. (5) It
might also be useful for Mr. Ulman to consult Mr, Kevin Maroney
of the Internal Security Section of the Department inasmuch as
Mr. Maroney has hong been involved in matters relating to
internal ‘security and foreign intelligence, and may be aware

of the extent of the AG's involvement.

ACTION:

With your approval, Office of Legal Counsel will
convey the information in the preceding paragraph to Mr. Ulman,
who said he can be contacted by telephone on 187-2051. He

requested an expeditious response.

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

ec eneate ante terpeineetit he inar sag

Telophone Rm. —
Director Sec’y —__

At 9:55 a.m. on July 3, 1975, former Assistant Director
__-dvan Conrad telephonically advised me that he has been contacted and
requested to appear for interview by the Senate Select Committee during
the week of July 7, 1975, concerning Martin Luther King. Mr. Conrad
expressed great concern about his appearance for such an interview and
requested guidance.

I told.him that the Director was cooperating with the Committee
in their inquiry, but that in regard to matters that would identity informants,
affect current operations, or compromise very sensitive techniques any
testimony may require limitation to members of the Committee or to the
Chairman rather than staff interviewers. .

Mr. Conrad then asked whether he should respond in the
event questions were raised concerning sensitive matters regarding the
U.S. mails. I told him that in the event questions were asked which ——
appeared to be beyond the scope of the subject matter indicated for the
interview, or which in his judgment would involve the three areas of
concern expressed above, it would be appropriate for him to request a
recess for the purpose of consulting with the Bureau.

>

Mr. Conrad inquired as to his possible criminal liability and
whether the FBI would furnish him counsel. I explamed to him the difficulties
imposed by conflicts of interest in that regard and that the FBI could not
furnish him personal counsel. I told him that if he felt the need for advice
as to his personal status, he should consider obtaining the services of a
personal counsel. He said that he would consider that and that although he
was specifically not-making a request at this time, he would consider in the
future requesting that the Bureau pay fori his Bebvate ce ane ie :

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

Mr. Conrad was cordial and said he understood fully that
I was not in a position to furnish him legal advice. I suggested that he
contact the Bureau prior to his appearance for the interview in order to be
advised formally as to his release from the Bureau employment agreement
concerning secrecy and he agreed.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

Telephone Rm. __
This is to record inquiry received from_Mr, Leon 9 ste Sey—
Ullman; Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal
Counsel, and recommend response to him,

On 7/22/75, Mr. Ulman called Assistant Director -
Legal Counsel J.A. Mintz to request assistance concerning
an assignment he had been given by the Attorney General (AG)
relating to the current investigation being conducted by the
Senate Select Committee (SSC), In accordance with Mr. Mintz'
referral to our Senstudy project group, Mr. Ulman was contacted
7/22/75 by Supervisor J. P, Thomas, Mr. Ulman said that the
AG had requested his office to prepare, by 7/25/75, the fullest
possible response to the question, "To what extent has the AG
been involved in consideration or approval of policies and
activities of U.S. foreign and military intelligence agencies?"
Mr, Ulman said that he had requested the Criminal Division
of the Department to conduct research on this matter but, being
unfamiliar with foreign intelligence matters, desired to know
whether we could in any way assist him, He was informed that
‘the FBI is basically not a U.S. foreign intelligence agency.
He responded that some of our operations involve foreign
intelligence and again asked if we could assist. He was told
that we certainly could not furnish any full answer, but would
attempt to see if we could contribute something to his assign-
ment. It was also suggested to Mr. at that RE: der
contacting Mr. K, William O'Connor ate as Ha oe many/ ‘O vi
aspects of the SSC investigation for the Department, and mi
be able to clarify the request or contribute to the respémiaeemer wees
and that he consider contacting CIA. He indicated hedid not
feel that contact with CIA would be productive. It was8aghitegs 1975
that the inquiry appears to relate to the AG institutionally
rather than to any involvement of the incumbent, Mr. Ler
