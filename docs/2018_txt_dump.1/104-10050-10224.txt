SU°JECT: “elay in sending the first cable about
OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the delay (by the Mexico
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book as a
case of lazines on the part of the Soviet case officer (thich
in ty view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know wat he was’ talking about).

2. Normally , the Spanish transcript for the 1 Oc
convers ation would have been picked up on the mornin
Znd of October. The Russian language portion would: ‘Ray a of
to the Russ ian/English trans criber on the 3rd of J

   
   
 

 

at vhich time, the Soviet case officer’ wound ha
the photographic coverage. ‘That coverage ee net have been
in the station before the 7th since ae on was still in the
camera on the 3rd of October and Sas cked up probably on
the 4th, processed and passed tqQ@th #* Station on the next work

 
   
 

day which would have been Maxd ‘October.
3. Later the film was % > en out of the camera every day : i
but at that time, the filmstayed in the camera until a full 4

roal was completed which might take three or four das.

4. A name trace could have been reques ted on the bas is
of the name alone but that wasn't the way Win Scott ran that
Station. He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the
telephone coverage ...s ometimes...there_was..a U.S. ..automobile
license number. . It. was also part of the "numbers game” of -
justifying a project ly the number of dis patches, cables or
reports produced. :
