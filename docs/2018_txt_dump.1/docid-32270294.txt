2 JUS ve,

DirNSA/M5 (Mr Lear)
Ft George G Meade, MD 20755 -

Dear Jim

‘Iam forwarding a letter from a former Security Service member to you.
It was furnished to us by the recipient, through his commander, at one
of our subordinate units. ; .

After realizing the implications, true or otherwise, we immediately !
notified our unit commander to turn it over to the OSI in Florida,
believing they would contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

since the writer is a civilian now.

Yesterday, this office was contacted by an OSI agent at Lowry AFB, CO;
this agent happens to be an ex-Security Service man. He was instructed

by his headquarters to interview the writer of the letter to determine

the names of other individuals he had tontacted. Apparently Mr. Christen-
sen has a long history of alcoholism, family problems and now wants to
see a "cleared psychiatrist" as he attributes all of his problems from ;
Oct 1963, per the OSI agent. In addition, he has indicated to the OSI \
that he now fears for his life.

I am furnishing this to you as I feel the implication in the letter :
should best be handled at the national level and that you are in the :
best position to contact the Bureau. I have no knowledge that OSI has
not done this, but in view of the fact the subject was interviewed as

a civilian by an AF agent, rather than an FBI agent, leads me to doubt
this. In addition, you are in a much better position to determine where
the nearest psychiatrist, with access, is located. for your information,
we placed the classification markings on the letter.

 

We were told by Mr. Coombs, the OSI agent at OSI District 14, that the
doctor to contact at the VA hospital in Cheyenne, WY is a Dr Sedel,
commercial telephone number 778-7550, extension 273.

Warm regards
