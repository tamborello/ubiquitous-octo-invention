SUBJECT : HSCA Request for Declassification of
Helms Transcripts

1. The HSCA forwarded on 4 September 1978 a request
that the attached portions of transcripts from Mr. Helms'
testimony before Committee be declassified.

2. It is requested that you review this on a priority
basis, reporting back to this office those sections that
need sanitization prior to declassification where you
have a substantive interest. Where you have not addressed
problems please so signify. As an example, AMLASH's true
name should be deleted and replaced by the crypt.

3. There clearly are sections that will require
sanitization, at least, prior to declassification; if
declassification is impossible (e.g. telephone and photo-
graphic coverage in Mexico City) please state the reason.
